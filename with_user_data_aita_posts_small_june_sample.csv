"I'm on vacation with my extended family that I haven't seen for the past 4 years. I was dropped off at the airport by my SO so I need someone to pick me up, and he offered.


Before my trip, I emailed him my flight information. During my trip I took a screenshot of my flight information and texted it to him a couple of days before I needed to fly back home. 


It's the night before I fly out around noon the next day, and he asks me when and where he needs to pick me up. I tell him my phone is dying, and we are still out. I tell him to look it up. (Remember I've emailed and texted him the flight information. He has the airline and flight number. And he knows the time which tells me he referenced the photo I previously sent him.) 


He tells me no, that's my job since he's the one doing me the favor. I tell him I'm out and about with a dying phone and he can either look it up or wait. (Texted him the old screenshot so he knows the airport and time, but that's not enough info apparently.)


I proceed to get upset, because I feel like I've given him plenty of info. Everytime I pick someone up. I follow the signs that match the flight info given to me. I honestly don't know what additional information I can give him at this point.


Unfortunately he calls me a dick/asshole and I call him childish for having to look shit up for him that's a quick Google. I tell him I'll just have someone else pick me up that knows the information better, but hes adamant about picking me up if only I give him the when and where.


I finally get to the place I'm staying, hook my phone up to charge and Google it. Unfortunately it's not the clearest answer due to the fact that it could change with a delay or change in flight. I give him my best guess and tell him that I'm not 100% positive since I normally just go to the airport and follow the prompts and use the flight number in case there's a dramatic change in termibal/gate. I text him a screenshot of the most recent info again.


In the end I'm still upset that I had to look this information up for him. The info I texted him included the airport, airline, flight number, time, gate I was arriving at, but was missing a clear and distinct terminal. But based on my memory from when he dropped me off it's pretty self explanatory once you're on the ground, but a tad harder when looking at the website. He did not accept my answer of follow the prompts at the airport. 


He's upset that I cant give him the information and calling him childish for not even trying to Google it while I'm with my family.


I will admit I was being a tad of a dick with how I was telling him to look it up once he started to push back on the matter. But am I the asshole for being upset that he couldn't even take the time to look up any additional information given the information I had already provided?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	18.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

After that there was a lot of rumors and insults about them behind their back. I know if someone was talking shit about me I would wanna know but I feel like I would just be making them feel bad. Should I be honest and tell them or just keep it a secret.	Not enough info	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
