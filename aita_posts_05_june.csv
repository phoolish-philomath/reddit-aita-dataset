bxc6id	2019-06-06 03:59:40		WIBTA for asking a party to be moved?	"I love stranger things, it’s one of my favorite indulgences in silly sci-fi. 

My roommates and I have a terse relationship. One of them used to be my best friend (why I moved into this space) but she’s very involved in the friend group with my other roommate, that I’m not apart of nor have I been invited to be. It’s fine, people drift apart. Happens.

Our roommate told me she’d like to invite that friend group over for a stranger things viewing party. It comes out on the 4th of July, so that’s the natural assumption for the date. I’m normally really accommodating to my roommates about dates and things. They have multiple days a week where people are over to record their podcasts and an internet review show.

I really don’t want the party to be on that Thursday. I could watch it with everyone, but I’m never exactly invited to these things. Normally, I just walk into my living room and there are people there. They’re not rude about me hanging out or anything, but intentionally invited Or even introduced I am not. it’d be crammed into our living room and surrounded by people I’m not friends with, and I’d much rather watch it in my room by myself so I can talk to some online pals about it. It’s gonna be like an 9 hour process, and I just want to have that Thursday to peacefully take breaks and make snacks in my kitchen with no awkwardness and be able to watch the show without having to listen to everyone reacting to different parts in the living room. (Not very thick walls.) 

But, I’m aware this is kind of selfish. 4th of July IS a holiday, but it being held on Friday or even Saturday wouldn’t be a problem for me... would I be the asshole to ask it not be held on 4th of July?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

One one of them has a habit of going on my social media and poking around. He saw my ex’s sister posted a picture of their recently deceased grandmother and decided to comment on it. 

I tried to stop him but my other friends pinned me down. Sure I could’ve tried harder but my friends pinning me down were massive, and I really couldn’t fight back. 

With all of his wit and humor he commented “RIP hoe”... I proceeded to get texts from my ex and her sister calling me every expletive in the book for doing such a terrible thing. I tried explaining it wasn’t me and I tried to stop him.

"My Fiance and I are getting married in 2 months and she just found out her dad is now homeless. He recently put this on blast on social media asking for money to help him find accommodations.

The thing is, he's been on the verge of becoming homeless for the past several years, not able to hold a job, a history of being bailed out and just ending up right back in the same situation, and also spends hundreds on cigarettes. 

We're obviously not receiving any financial support from him or her family for the wedding, so we're having to pay for it all ourselves. I basically said we need to focus on paying for our upcoming wedding and can't help him. My fiance supports this saying bailing him out is useless anyway.

I haven’t asked him to, he just does it out of the kindness of his heart, but I don’t like how long he leaves it.

I want to ask him to mow it shorter if he’s gonna mow it but my wife says that’s an asshole thing to do because its not like we are paying him to do it, he’s doing it for free.

bxc2ar	2019-06-06 03:46:13	alinlinks	AITA for moving out?	"So, I just turned 20 and I’m about to move into my friend’s place, which is a few blocks away from where I live now. Under any other circumstance, I would think that going through all of that effort to move such a short distance wouldn’t be worth it. But the thing is, I live with my mom, my grandmother, and my grandpa. My grandpa is great, and my mom and I more or less know how to sort our shit out. But my grandma... 


Well, she’s a hoarder. A bad one. And she won’t lend a hand when it comes to cleaning so the responsibility of keeping the house clean falls on my mom and I, as does caring for her animals, making her dinners and basically anything else that she wants us to do for her. If she were kind and good natured like my grandpa, I wouldn’t mind— but she isn’t. As long as I’ve known her she’s been nothing but greedy, manipulative, abusive, and she seriously triggers a lot of PTSD in me. And no matter how much effort we put towards cleaning the house, and taking care of her and all of her pets, it’s never enough. It’s to the point where we clean and the house is trashed he very next day. I’m kind of just done with it. 


Anyway, my best friend offered me a place to stay and I’m taking it. But when I told me mom about it, she got really upset with me and accused me of abandoning her. She’s accepted the fact that she can’t stop me, but every time I mention it she brings up how difficult it’s going to be to survive without me, and talks about how devastating it’s going to be for my grandpa. 


We’ve talked about it before but she insists that I should wait until she can afford a place for just the three of us without my grandma. But I’ve tried to persuade her to look, and I’ve offered to help her, but I just get shot down. And as much I would love to stay with my mom, being near my grandma takes a huge emotional toll on me. And my mom knows this. 

Am I seriously the asshole for trying to get away from someone that makes me so miserable?

bxc21h	2019-06-06 03:45:30	pepper701	AITA for how I handled the situation with my neighbors?	"I moved recently, however, I saw my old neighbors a few days ago and they laughed and took pictures of me. I’m starting to doubt myself. Please enlighten me and tell me if I was the one in the wrong here.

I lived in my precious house for ten years off of an alleyway, that is about two car lengths wide. There were no issues with my neighbors for the first few years. Then things went very downhill. First, my mom got cancer. She wanted to park in her garage because she was sick and didn’t want to walk far. The neighbors were upset by this, because they liked to have all their children play in the alleyway, and they would have to move all the toys and look at us annoyed, when we wanted to pull in our garage. They asked us to park on the street, but my mom was sick and she did not want to. Things got worse when one day my mom was pulling into the driveway and one of their kids ran out between two cars into the alley and she honked the horn loudly, as she was very startled. The kid’s parents were furious and who knows what they told the other neighbors, but that caused them to really hate her. As time went on, they would do things like park their car right behind our driveway so we couldn’t leave our garage, leave trash in the alley, leave toys in the alleyway so we would have to move them to pull in, set up games and tents on our driveway, they were on our porch drinking wine at least one time, had their kids go on our porch and their kids would spit on our driveway, and their dogs would run loose in the alley. I couldn’t walk my dog for the fear their off-leash dogs would attack him. They would also have loud parties in the alleyway and we could not leave our house. Now why do I think I was the jerk here? Because the way the neighbors acted. They always gave us dirty looks. They seem like normal people on social media. Should we have just parked on the street? They thought we were the worst people ever and I cannot help but feel I was and I still have anxiety over this. Please help me set the record straight, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxbxof	2019-06-06 03:32:23	how-bout-yes	AITA if I don't apologize to my mom?	"So, I have trouble with apologizing to people. I'm very proud and stubborn, so it usually has to involve someone that is important in my life, and I really hurt bad to actually own up. When I do, the person usually accepts my apology, or on special occasions, they don't. However, apologizing has usually helped me feel better in making amends with the other party, or at least gives me the sense of owning up to what I did. Then there's my mom. I usually feel the worst when I do or say something to her, so I've apologized to her several times before. However, she never really accepts it, and usually continues to berate and scold me for what I did. It doesn't make me feel better or even as if I had made an effort to make amends, I just feel sort of a mix of anger and disappointment of myself. 

So I got into a sort of argument with my mom earlier today on how to do things, and she went on a long tirade as to how she is older, has more experience, and even though she's not educated or rich, etc, she knows what she's doing. I would have accepted this if it hadn't been for her going on and on even after I told her okay, I get it. It rubbed off as her claiming superiority of a sort, so I walked out on her. Later I feel bad, and want to apologize, but considering how she's been in the past, I really don't feel like she'll value or care for it, so I might as well not.

bxbx75	2019-06-06 03:30:58	aspicyboy	WIBTA for quitting my job and leaving them with no replacement?	"EDIT: didn’t mean to make it sound like I don’t get payed at all for staying two hours after; I’m simply not paid any “extra” which I’ve been told some people get paid for working overtime.

It’s my summer before my first year of university, I’m 17 and I work as a hostess at a restaurant. I don’t mind working, and I certainly want a job to save up money, but the job I currently hold is literally tearing me apart.

As a hostess, I have to do basic things like seat the door, answer carry outs, take reservations, etc, which isn’t too bad. However, recently they’ve been having me pick up on bussing tables and setting them, and taking drink/food orders for our waitresses when they’re all busy. I don’t mind this when I have 1 or 2 other hostesses helping, but I’ve been working by myself since this past October. We recently hired a second hostess, but she quit after she experienced her first busy Friday. She lasted 2 weeks.

As we get into the summer season, everything is picking up. Carry outs, deliveries, tables, and I can’t handle doing 4 things at once. It’s gotten to the point where I’m so overwhelmed that I’ve gone and cried in the back for the past month or two because they put too much on me. They always say they’re going to “hire more people,” but the only girl we had just quit.

My parents are sympathetic, but in the end their words are little more than “well, this is the real world. suck it up.” I get that, hostessing isn’t rocket science, but the fact I don’t get any help, nor do I get anymore extra money for staying 2 hours past my shift or for doing those other jobs really sucks, and I feel like they’re taking advantage of my age. Only problem is that I don’t want to leave them with no hostess. I could tell them that I’ll work until they find a new one, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll get anybody and I don’t want to put another girl in the same position I am in now.

So, WIBTA if I quit, relatively soon? Like, 2-3 weeks soon? Most adults are just telling me to suck it up, but my friends all seem to think that this is unfair and I should call it quits. I know I can keep doing this, but I really don’t want to.

TL;DR: I’m expected to do multiple jobs at once and will probably not be getting any more help or money soon. I want to quit, but my parents think I should suck it up. Don’t want to be an ass and quit right in the middle of our busy season and fuck shit up.

Additionally, I would get another job, but I don’t think anyone will hire me for ~2 months, since I’ll be leaving for college in August, and I have no transportation anywhere else. This place is roughly a 15 minutes bike from my house, so it’s super convenient. Already told my job I will be quitting roughly about the first week of August."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxbt0s	2019-06-06 03:18:05	Orange_Snowflake	"AITA for upsetting my wife by confronting loud moviegoers during a screening of ""A Quiet Place""?"	"So this story took place about a year ago, when the horror film ""A Quiet Place"" was in theaters. I'm only posting it here now because my wife and I have gotten starkly different opinions from the people who have heard it, and they actually seem to be based mostly along gender lines. (The men who have heard this story think I was justified, while the women don't.) So I'm curious what you think.

My wife (23F) and I (25M) were out at the theater one night, seeing ""A Quiet Place,"" which is a movie that loud audience members can easily ruin. Unfortunately, our showing had those. The theater was probably about 1/3rd full, but there were three teenage boys, sitting in a back corner, talking and laughing quite loudly. Lots of people were turning to look at them, but nobody was doing anything. After a couple of minutes, I was getting pretty annoyed too. I wanted to solve the problem as quickly and cleanly as possible, so I said, loud enough to be heard, ""hey, can you guys shut the fuck up, please?"" One of the kids said, ""sorry!"" an audience member up front laughed, and then all was quiet.

For a while, it worked. The kids were dead silent for a solid half hour, but they eventually eased back into their original volume - even going so far as to rip loud farts and burst into laughing fits. Again, the audience members were turning around and were clearly annoyed, but nobody was doing a thing. So I did.

As quietly as I could, I got up from my seat (already near the back of the theater) and made my way to the kids in the very back. My wife grabbed at my arm, but I was already up and moving, so I pulled it away. I bent down when I reached the kids and quietly whispered, ""Hey guys, you're way too loud back here. It's a problem. Next disruption you make, I'm gonna go find someone and get you kicked out."" They whispered their apologies back to me, I went back to my seat, and the kids didn't make a peep for the remaining hour-plus of the movie.

When the movie ended, I was surprised to learn that my wife was really upset with me. She agreed that the kids were obnoxious and ruining the movie for everyone, but she was mad that I confronted them. Apparently she was embarrassed when I told them to shut up, and she got really scared when I went over to the kids because she thought I might try and fight them or something. (I should note that I have literally never been physically aggressive with anybody in my life.) I maintained that the problem was clear, the solution was clear, and someone had to do it. I did concede to her, however, that I probably should have warned her beforehand that I was going to get up and talk to the kids, and I apologized to her quite thoroughly for that. But still, the disagreement about my actions remains over a year later.

bxbpgr	2019-06-06 03:07:47		AITA for ordering drinks underage and getting a server in big trouble?	"My friends and I went to a restaurant that was super busy. 

The waiter just gave us a drink menu and told us the drink specials, no questions asked. We are all born in 2000, and at 18-19, none of us are able to legally drink. My friends drink at house parties and kickbacks. But none of us have ordered a drink at a bar/restaurant before.

I don’t drink but I was looking at my friends to see if they were going to order. We were all gassed and amped.

One friend was unsure and was worried if she was going to get ID’d or in trouble.

Honestly, I’ve never heard my friends order a drink before so it was kind of exciting for me and I wanted to see that. I told her the worst thing that could happen is they ID her and say no. She said fuck it and ordered a drink when he came back. My other friends ordered drinks too. 

At some point, some other guy who works there comes over and I think he was the manager. He asked us if we have ID and we said nothing. It was deadass a “anna-oop” moment. 

He was waiting on an answer, so we told them we don’t have ID and he asked us who our server was. We said we couldn’t remember.

But then he asked another server who was at the table and they pointed him out.

We tried denying it was our waiter but he admitted to serving our table. From then on, we started tried taking full responsibility. 

The manager guy looked so aggy and he was literally red with anger. Our server looked like they were going to cry.

I feel like an asshole because this wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t pressure my friend to order a drink. I also feel that being ordering a drink, we put the waiter in trouble. The right thing would have been to admit that we were not able to drink."	Everyone Sucks	1	0
bxbpg1	2019-06-06 03:07:44	throwaway060519	WIBTA for kicking my niece out of my house?	"Original post had 14,000 characters because i'm fuming mad about this situation.

&#x200B;

To make it short and simple for Reddit it boils down to this:

My niece moved in with me to escape her parents because they are trying to get her back on the right path in life and continue her college education and avoiding drugs, but she wants to just do whatever she wants and is tired of being told what to do. She is 19 and legally an adult, no one can FORCE her to do anything she is unwilling to do, so I decide to take her in hoping to give her some advice without trying to directly control her and just hope she might start listening to me because i'm trying to help her instead of directly rebelling against her controlling parents.

&#x200B;

However, it doesn't work out that way. I give her a few very simple rules for living here. Keep the doors in the house closed (there are reasons I wont get into), keep the gate at the front of the property shut, don't make too much noise (she loves listening to loud ass music), and don't bring any drugs or weapons onto my property. That's it. That is literally all I asked of her in exchange for living here.

&#x200B;

Well fuck me I guess because she started breaking every rule I had immediately. She started leaving doors open all over the house, even once leaving the front door open. I mean who the hell even does that? Just leaves the front door open? It was letting the cool air out and letting bugs inside and the dogs could've ran outside unsupervised. She also left the gate open numerous times. I haven't seen any drugs, but I haven't exactly been snooping either, however I did catch her playing with an assault rifle-looking BB gun and told her to leave that in her car, I don't want it in the house or used on my property. She argues about it ""not being a weapon"" for a while but finally relents and agrees. Today I find it in her room when I was looking for her (to complain about her leaving the front door wide open), so she disregarded that too.

&#x200B;

She lies to me constantly, on a daily basis, about literally everything. I can't detail it all because that's how I hit a 14,000 character count in my first post, but i'm sick to death of it. She also begged me to let her get a dog, I said NO, I do not want a dog in the house and I tell her that she is an irresponsible dog owner and shouldn't have a dog. I said this because she is 19 now, and since 18 years old she bought then abandoned 2 other dogs. A couple of days ago she just comes home with one anyway.

&#x200B;

Im tired of this shit. I'm tired of her. I want her gone. She has somewhere to go if I kick her out and she also has her parents' house, so it isn't like she'd be on the street. But i'm strongly considering kicking her ass out tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Edit: Some people are getting this mistaken impression I thought i'd be better parents than her parents. While that would easily be true, her parents are horrible people, that isn't why I let her stay with me. She was determined to leave her parents regardless. She had already made up her mind. I let her stay with me because between the options of her being in my home where I could somewhat keep an eye on her vs her living with some strangers who knows where, I judged it to be safer for her and more reasonable to give her a chance to live with me instead. I didn't think i'd turn her into a functional adult over night, I just didn't expect her to deliberately disobey every rule I put in place out of spite because we have always had a good relationship and she has never behaved this way, she has even stayed here over holidays before for a week or so and never had an issue.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: I'm helping her load her stuff into a uhaul right now and afterwards she'll be driving off to her new place. She is officially no longer living here as of now. Thankfully it all went down without any confrontation. We talked for a bit and she agreed to leave because she was unhappy with the arrangement and having to keep doors and the gate closed and she wants that dog. As of now, it's no longer my problem. I just hope the best for her as well as that poor puppy. Only solace I take is in knowing the last 2 dogs she abandoned found actual good owners after the fact, so it all worked out in the end. I can only hope if/when she bails on this one, it will also find a good home."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxbpfs	2019-06-06 03:07:43		AITA for not talking to my two younger sisters who I live with?	"3 weeks ago me (22) and my sister (19) got into a huge fight that started all because she was complaining about how she doesn’t have money. All I simply said was “dude you need to be more responsible. You don’t pay for car insurance you don’t pay rent where does all your money go? You gotta be more mature” She yelled at me and said “you think just because you got an abortion you are so mature. Get over it everyone fucking goes through some shit” Mind you that I did not say “I am so mature because I had an abortion”.  

She also continued to say that my other younger sister (15) hated me because I didn’t approve of her lesbian relationship. I don’t care if she’s lesbian. I’m happy with whoever she ends up with. The reason why I don’t approve of it is because she’s been lying to my mom saying that’s her best friend. And the reason why her girlfriend is always spending the night is because her step father abuses her. (Which is 100% not true) My two other sisters get a long so well. They are always making plans and never invite me. They are always making jokes. I try talking to my other younger sister (15) by making small talk. She always tells me I’m annoying or gives me a dry response.

Anyways back to my other sister. After she said that I threw a chair at her and stormed off crying. My abortion is a really sensitive topic. I wish I never told them. They judge me so much for it. Anyways I completely ignore both of them. I will literally walk right past them and act like they don’t exist. My mom says I should be the adult and talk to them. I refuse.

To keep it short, there was a video of me (18F) that I showed to him (19M), something that made me feel attractive and I was kinda looking from validation from him about it. (I’ve had a lot of mental health issues in the past, and a part of it is really due to insecurities. This doesn’t impact our relationship much, it’s more-so something we generally accommodate for when needed.) 

He said it was good and I asked him, maybe when I shouldn’t have, if it was good compared to other people, or if he thought there was any better than me. It didn’t seem like the type of situation where he felt put on the spot, and there was no difference in behavior. He was honest and said that there are some people that I could never top. This is all in regards to physical appearances, not technique of the video or anything.

I know I asked for an answer, but it hurt really bad to hear him say that. I’ve felt like he’s sometimes too honest about his attraction to other people and wish he would say things that would make me feel better. We have been together for 4 years. 

I really don’t know if this is something I should keep to myself or if I should be honest and tell them I felt insulted by him.

I don’t know if I’m the asshole for asking and/or getting upset over it, or if he might be the asshole for being honest when he knew his answer would upset me. I’d love input here."	Asshole	1	0

&#x200B;

Now, I’m not an idiot; I know 16 year olds drink and smoke. I did WAY worst when I was that age. And honestly, my kid is a great kid. 6 AP classes, all A’s with maybe 2 Bs his high school career. He’s always honest and respectful. It’s summer now; he deserves a little of a break.

&#x200B;

I know his mom would flip though if she caught him smoking weed. I told him he needs to hide his tracks better, and left it at that. If she catches him, that’s on him, but I really couldn’t care less that he smoked; using a vape is a helluva lot better than drinking into organ failure.

It started when the neighbor’s son below us started playing music too loud. I’m talking my water I was drinking was vibrating from the bass of their speakers. My gf got fed up and stomped on our floors. The music stopped. This petite African American single mom and 13 yr old son came banging on our door. 
She claimed that her son should be allowed to play his music loud because he’s pursuing his music career. Then she started complaining about our loud sex as an excuse for her sons loud music. Finally we agreed that her son could play his music from 3-4pm each day. I wished her and her son good luck and they left. 

A couple weeks later my girlfriend and myself start going at it and we hear a loud banging from our neighbors. It was on a Wednesday at 10pm. It killed the mood. 

I’ve lived with at least 5 roommates before moving in with my gf and never heard that our sex was too loud.

bxblv3	2019-06-06 02:57:02	a025	WIBTA for ending a 6 year friendship for wanting to be vegan?	"So some background information: My best friend and I have been friends since high school and have gotten closer as the years went on. We're at the point in our lives where we're nearing the end/graduating from college and becoming adults. She recently got into this really competitive master's program in a big city that she'll start in the fall, but I got an amazing job opportunity in the same big city that I started a couple days ago.

So after settling into the city and starting my job, I told her how the last couple days were and I expressed that I actually feel happy for the first time for in a long time. She seemed happy for me and said she hopes she'll be that happy too when she starts her master's in the fall.

Anyways, we were talking and I told her that I was thinking/wanting to go vegan since I don't eat meat that much anyways and was thinking of going a step further. This is where she blew up. She said I was insane for even thinking of going vegan and there's literally nothing to eat. She went on to list all the things I would not be able to eat and when I go out I would only be able to eat a salad. She said her mom would never approve and she could never do it. I told her that I never said she had to do vegan with me and then she said she knew that, but then again listed more foods I would never be able to eat. 

I got pretty frustrated at this point because she was being so unsupportive and acting like this was going to affect HER life. I told her this and she said ""well you can do what makes you happy, I just don't  understand why you need to unnecessarily limit yourself to so many food options."" I ended the conversation and went to bed. But, the next day she went out to sushi with her bf and sent me a pic of a side salad she got and captioned ""this is all you would be able to eat if you go vegan."" I said she was being rude and she replied to say her bf told her to send that to me. I didn't respond. Clearly, I was mad.

Later in the day, my mom called me and I told her what my friend was saying to me about going vegan (I told my mom long before that I was thinking of going vegan and she was very supportive of the idea. She even wanted to try it out with me). My mom said it doesn't make sense my friend would start an argument and start being rude just because I was thinking of going vegan. My mom thinks my friend is jealous of the job opportunity I got and my friend is taking it out on me anyway she can. My mom thinks my friend is probably not the best friend to have around since it seems like to my mom that my friend doesn't want to me to be more successful than her and it's the first signs of a toxic friendship.

&#x200B;

WIBTA for thinking of (slowly) ending this friendship?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My friend of six years is being really unsupportive and rude about the idea of me going vegan. My mom thinks the issue is more than just me wanting to go vegan. My mom thinks my friend is jealous of me and this is the first signs of a toxic friendship and I should end it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxblhh	2019-06-06 02:55:52	Steppiekins	WIBTA if I asked my Best Man to no longer be Best Man?	"Writing on behalf of my fiancé. This is ultimately his decision that I will support either way but we don’t want to be the assholes even though it’s our wedding. 

We are getting married in less than two weeks. The engagement is rather short (about 46 days), so we’re doing something somewhat non-traditional and simple - no bridesmaids or groomsmen, but of course a Matron of Honor and Best Man. Due to the short engagement, we did not task them with anything outside of standing there with us. 

My fiancé doesn’t have family here and has a handful of friends, and not really one he considers his best friend (aside from me of course). 

When we set the date he admits he rushed in asking his friend he is closest to at work instead of a friend he has had a longer and more mature relationship with. This could be in part due to how infrequently he sees this other friend compared to his coworker, so his coworker was top of mind as soon as we set the date. They don’t hang out outside of work but definitely are more friends than colleagues. 

Before and unrelated to the engagement, they came up with an agreement that would help each other save money during a certain period of time due to work travels that wouldn’t be reimbursed by their employer. 

About a week ago, my fiancé’s friend admitted to breaking the plan without warning. My fiancé expressed his disappointment and decided to do his own thing. 

Anyway, my fiancé has admittedly put a little bit of distance between them since. He hasn’t ghosted him and is still on friendly terms, but this experience has made him come to realize his friend’s level of maturity (they’re 42 and 27, friend is younger if that makes a difference) that he just doesn’t want to deal with. He is piecing things together from past comments his friend has made or things he does that are a little annoying but not deal breakers in terms of friendship.

For example, he always feels like his friend throws subtle one-ups at him with their shared interests or the fact that his parents are wealthy and substantially help him financially. Also, a few weeks ago his friend texted him and said “Hey, when is your thing again?” “Thing” being our wedding. That offended my Fiancé because this wedding, while non-traditional, is still a big deal and his friend who committed to go and stand up for him couldn’t be bothered to even remember when the date is. Again, not anything to blow up over but an indication of immaturity and inconsideration. 

My fiancé no longer wants him as Best Man, but he doesn’t want to be an asshole and create unnecessary drama by asking him to withdraw. He thinks there’s a small chance the guy may bail, but we can’t be certain. He will appreciate him for doing it, but just doesn’t feel like the friend really deserves that honor.

bxbl17	2019-06-06 02:54:28	peonypegasus	AITA for expecting our dad to save up money to visit us?	"For some background: my dad makes decent money but isn't super responsible with it. He flies all over the country (and sometimes abroad) to go to concerts. This year, he's traveling to at least five shows, all of which have tickets in the 100s or 1000s. My dad and I have a close relationship. We talk on the phone weekly and have supported each other a lot. Most recently, I spent the past three months helping him with a tough personal situation. He also has a close relationship with my sister. In most ways, he's a great dad and we have almost always felt loved and supported.

My sister lives pretty far away from both of us. It's about a $100 plane ticket for my dad to go see her. When she moved in, he initially offered to help her move, but backed out at the last minute because ""money was tight."" She is an independent adult who pays her own rent and buys her own groceries. We haven't relied on money from our parents since we were teenagers.

I'm doing an unpaid internship this summer. I am supporting myself with grant money and my savings from working a job during the school year. My parents do not financially support me because I don't need it, although I know I could count on them in an emergency. 

My internship is in a pretty cool place and I have been enjoying exploring and occasionally treating myself to a regional specialty, but I'm still being really frugal. I invited my dad to visit me because I have a spare room and he's never been to the area. It's a pretty cheap flight to get there. My dad said that he would in two months, but warned me that money is tight, so I need to look up free and cheap things to do in my area. I was ok with that, but when I mentioned a brunch spot (about $10 for a meal), he told me that he couldn't afford going out to eat and that we would just have to eat at my apartment.

Neither my sister nor I have said anything to him about it, but I'm really frustrated that he hasn't been able to save any money to do things on his visit and she's really frustrated that he didn't help her unpack in her new place. He has a $1200 ticket for a big concert that he just bought and has purchased plane tickets and concert tickets for two other shows. My sister and I are frustrated because money isn't tight when it's time to splurge on concert tickets, but it suddenly is tight when it's time to visit his children. On the other hand, he is an adult and it's his money to do with as he wishes."	No A-holes here	0	0

Tonight it was because of a thunderstorm because im terrified of tornadoes. 

But, my partner went to a party tonight we were both invited to, and I didn't go because of my anxiety.  I knew I'd just be anxious and not fun to be around. I told my partner to go because I knew they wanted to go even though the storm hadn't rolled in yet.  They also mentioned possibly spending the night there since they got stuff to do tomorrow in that area.

Then like, they stop replying to my texts, even the ones where I'm like ""hey the rain started""  ""thundering now"" like just kind of a  hey I need like, just a text from you and then I'll be ok. 

But 9pm rolls around after i take a nap, the party was supposed to end at 8, partner isn't home, no messages from them. So i message my friend who was hosting the party like ""hey i thought the party ended at 8??""

They said ""it just kinda continued"".   We talked for a bit before i asked if my partner was spending the night. My friend said ""i dunno i'll ask""  then told me ""yeah they're crashing here also their phone died""

Like, i didn't even know their phone was getting low, and i found out from my friend, who was hosting the party, not my partner, that's what was going on. Like, i dunno it would have been nice to know that they were going to be unreachable during a time where I was painfully anxious and what their plan was.

So firstly I wanna say I'm 17 about to graduate I usually date 20-22 year olds but will date as young as fifteen if they are almost 16. He is 16 in 2 months but held back a grade and is in grade 9.

So my friend has this history of being codependant (showing up to my house uninvited, spamming my messages, etc.) But he is also very caring and thoughtful. We began our friendship basically through him forcing his way into my life despite the fact I did not like him at all and found it creepy him always showing up at my house.

As we became closer friends I started to feel that maybe I had judged him wrong. He also has a lot in common with an ex I just adore. So I started to get butterflies but tried to ignore them so as not to feed into his suffocating behaviour.

Then without warning a part of me decided that I actually want to be with him, I just can't have other people know (the grade difference looks bad, and he is seen as creepy by most people in my school which makes me feel embarrassed by him yet also guilty for my feelings) also that we aren't committed to eachother since I am going to college soon and still want some freedom over the summer, and that I won't do anything physical with him.

So one day he texts me that his sister died. I rushed over telling myself not to take advantage of the situation, yet after a few hours we are laughing and smiling and the moment is perfect and we kiss.

So he agrees to my terms yet for days later he kept going on about us like we are a couple and trying to hangout with me at any moment. At this point the clingyness completely changed how I felt about him, but he started implying that he wants to date me for many years and also wants us to start having sex.

Then today I get the news that I am moving out right after graduation instead of late August.

The boy kept spamming me so I explained everything and told him we could go back to only friends since I don't love him and I date to marry so I am not willing to date a 9th grader. He was angry and depressed over this. I finally give him the option that we can keep up what we are doing until I move.

I am so scared he will tell somebody about me letting word get out that I hurt his feelings after his sister died when I tried to explain what I am and am not comfortable with.

I know I can't ""break up"" with him because his sister just died! So am I the antagonist for going against my judgment and kissing my friend the day his sister died, resulting in being morally obligated to partake in a romance with somebody I no longer want to be with?"		1	0

bxbbu4	2019-06-06 02:28:04		WIBTA If I cut all ties with my dad because he’s addicted to painkillers and tries to force me into financially assisting him?	"First- Let me try to explain the perspective. The title is from MY DAD’s perspective. My Grandpa is the one addicted to drugs. My dad asked my family for help and we’re at a rough spot, so I figured you guys could help.

 So. Let’s start with my grandpa. He’s in his early 80s and currently lives in a retirement home. My grandma died a year or so before I was born. My Grandpa was too emotionally overwhelmed and became depressed. Both my dad and my aunt lived in Northern California at the time and could not move to Los Angeles to constantly support him. For about ten years, he used his diabetes, heart disease, and spinal issues to justify abusing painkillers. About say 6 years ago my family moved down to Southern California for work and better school. We were able to support my Grandpa up until mid-last year. 

My Grandpa had issues falling, liver failure, kidney failure, intestinal failure-All sorts of weird shit he didn’t have just half a year earlier. My parents suspected something was up and monitored what he did normally. They found out he was using close to a bottle(something crazy like that) of painkillers a day. 

He ended up in the ER more times than we can count and we ended up making the tough decision to put him a nursing home to take care of his issues(earlier this year). 

My Grandpa was stubborn and addicted(because he was abusing painkillers for 16+ years). He found ways around the system, sneaking out at night, faking prescriptions, falling on purpose, accusing people of stealing, screaming about pain, breaking shit, all that good stuff that costed a-lot of money from my Dad’s pocket.

My Dad is pretty well of and makes good money. But the problem is he simply can’t afford the thousands of dollars of medical and legal damages my Grandpa causes. It’s putting strain on his marriage, his bank account, and his physical state.

So far, my Grandpa has been stubborn, he refuses to change, if we Cancel one drug he finds another. If we find another doctor, he changes it himself. 

I’ve suggested cutting ties with my Grandpa all together but would that be a dick move?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

I've completely changed my habits, including getting more sleep, eating healthier, doing exercise, attending therapy regularly, and changing my way of thinking about myself and the world in general. I'm doing a lot better.

Recently (about 3 or 4 months ago), I started chatting with an old friend from high school. I've been friends with this person for a while. We became friends my sophomore year, lost touch for a few years, and started chatting again a few months ago. We're not super close, but we can be pretty open with each other.

He suffers from depression as well. Things in his life are difficult, so I have sympathy and I empathize with him. The problem is that he refuses to do anything about it. When he first started opening up, I was really empathetic and tried my best to cheer him up every time we began to talk about his problems. But now, it's been months of this, which only bothers me because he *absolutely refuses* to do anything about it. I suggested therapy. He said no. I suggested exercise. He said he doesn't like going to the gym and that he's too lazy. I suggested eating better. He said it's too expensive. I even told him that he should try to change his way of thinking little by little, starting with not immediately blaming himself when something goes wrong and understanding that sometimes the world just sucks. He told me no again. Every single day, he complains about not having a SO, but won't try to look for a girlfriend or talk to anyone. When he gets extra depressed, I try to get him to talk about his feelings, but he usually makes a joke out of the situation halfway through, and then gets drunk. I told him to stop drinking because it's an extremely unhealthy way of coping with depression, but he makes a joke out of that too, and then does it again anyway.

When I was depressed, I didn't do anything about it for years. I also refused to get help, and I didn't understand why people got tired of being around me. It's only now that I understand that I dragged them down with me, and they stopped having sympathy for me because I refused to do anything to help myself. I care about my friend, but I can feel that happening to me. I feel sad and low every time I talk to him, and I get tired of listening to him complain about literally everything and giving him advice when he dismisses me as a joke and does nothing to better himself. I told him respectfully that I don't think me being friends with him is healthy because I was in a dark place for a really long time and I never want to go back. He told me I'm a piece of shit and that I'm ""abandoning"" him like everybody else.

I met my ex on tinder and we started talking and eventually we go on a date and end up having sex. She basically refused to let me get to know her and kept evading any questions id ask. So, I end things and go on with my life. A few months later she texts me that she’s pregnant and that its mine. I wanted nothing to do with the financial nightmare that is a child. I asked her if she had thought about abortion which she had but her mom convinced her shed regret it, so I then asked her if she would put it up for adoption which again she refused because of her mom. We argue about this for about a week and she ends up blocking me. I asked a few friends and they basically told me I was being an ass so after many conversations I decided to make amends. I called her mom and asked to speak to her and surprisingly she did. All was well and I could see myself raising this kid with her but then she tells me that this dude she was talking to at the time when we got together kissed her and I was like well if he kissed you and you didn’t reciprocate those feelings just let him know he shouldn’t be doing that and if he does you’ll have to cut him out of your life. She responds with “Well I can’t control what he does” Basically saying I’m not going to stop him. I then say, “If you don’t let him know and put your foot down then we are over” She tells me that she cut him out of her life. All goes back to being well until one day I asked her jokingly if he would be there when the kid is born since she had planned for him to be their before she and I got back together. Her response baffled me. She said, “he might show up we don’t know”. Like how do you just accidentally stumble upon someone giving birth? I press her for a yes or no and she basically just ignores the question by repeating that he might just accidentally stumble into the right hospital, on the right day, and at the right time. I then get livid and I say “If you want him there that bad then have him be the father” she gets upset and after a few hours she decided to break up. I’m excited for the birth we even got a target registry and were planning the baby shower. I was elated, until she starts to quit half way during sex. We would be having sex and shed just have this look on her face, so id ask her if she’s okay and she would roll away and wed stop and that would be that. Mind you she was about six months pregnant. I say okay we can continue how we are, or we can just not have sex until the baby comes out. She says she can’t go 3 months without sex and that she doesn’t want to have sex with me because I didn’t understand what she was going through without her needing to explain it to me. She then says she wants to have an open relationship, so she can have sex with someone who will understand what she’s going through the first time. I mean she wants to go hoe around at almost 7 months pregnant.  Am I the asshole for leaving?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxbar6	2019-06-06 02:24:57		AITA for not wanting my bfs to visit my family?	"Planning on going to visit my family for July 4th weekend. I'd rather go alone than with my bf. I assumed he didn't want to go so I was about to book a flight for myself. When I told him I was booking he was offended that I wanted to go without him. I assumed he didn't want to go.

My bf(34) and I(33) have been together for 12 years. we live together and have two dogs together and are about to buy our first house together. Over the course of our relationship, a big point of stress for me has been the way that he talks about my family. He has often referred to them as white trash. He disagrees with them politically, and has a problem with the way they do everything. 

A major issue is that my sister is a recovering drug addict so my parents are now raising her two children. He thinks that they are enabling her. He recently said that he refuses to be at the same family function as her and thar my parents are going to have to choose between him or my sister. Obviously they would choose their daughter. She is doing a lot better. Shes working and has been clean for about 6 months. I hate that whole situation, but it is what it is. When he basically said there would be an ultimatum, I figured that he didn't want to go and that's when I started planning on going solo.

When we've gone to the 4th of July party in the past we have had a nice time but he always complains about the sleeping arrangements, the lack of AC (my parents house is really old so only some rooms have window air conditioning), and how non-accommodating my parents are. It stresses me out and I feel overly self-conscious of anything that my family might do or say might annoy him. 

Every year friends and family come from out of state for this party. My parents try to accommodate for whoever wants to stay at the house. A few people even bring tents and camp in the yard. My parents recently bought a brand new huge RV that sleeps 6. This year they offered the RV to the band that will be playing for the party. When I told my mom that both of us would be coming she said there was room for us in the RV but we would haveto share with the band. They are family friends and play the party every year. I know them and it wouldn't be weird at all- plus we would get the queen size ""master bedroom"" in the RV. 

When I told my BF that we would have to share the RV, he seemed offended that my parents wouldn't give the RV to just us. I explained that they were just trying to accommodate as many guests as possible but he seemed upset about it. 

 I would rather go alone and enjoy my family without worrying about what my bf is thinking and how he is judging them. He seems really upset and offended that I would rather not have him there. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bxbagm	2019-06-06 02:24:09	MountainMama10	AITA for making my good friend pay for a skateboard he was borrowing that broke after he got hit by a car?	"Hi! First time ever posting here. I apologize if it's a bit long. Thank you!

So, I let my good friend, call him Matty, borrow my longboard that I purchased for 60 about 4 months ago. About a month ago, he messaged me that the board broke. I asked him how and he said that a car hit him and that his leg was swollen. So, Matty doesn't have that much money and all. I originally had no intention of making him pay as I don't need the money, and he was obviously upset about the car and in a tight money situation. He then mentioned that the guy paid him 60 dollars for the longboard, and Matty asked me if ""I wanted"" him to pay me back. I said sure. 

Yesterday, I asked him to venmo me the money when he gets the chance. He seemed kind of upset and passively mentioning phrases like ""not until my paycheck,"" ""bank account,"" and ""if you really want me to I guess."" He got mad at me (understandably) when he mentioned that I had offered to sell it to him for 40 before it broke. I realized this and changed the price to 40 immediately because that's the value that I put it at obviously. I also asked for the trucks and wheels back (only the deck snapped). From here, he accused me of basically robbing him. I can see where he's coming from, so I just said okay Matty 40 dollars is fine.

Now he was still livid. He did not actually ever want to pay me in the first place. Instead of saying ""yea MountainMama10, I'll pay you back."" He asked, ""you want me to pay you back?"" or ""Okay I'll give you the money I guess."" He was saying passive aggressive and mean stuff about me. He said I did not value my friends or family and that I just cared about the money. He called me inconsiderate and greedy. He said that while I was right from a business perspective, I was being a terrible friend. I did not say anything mean to him yet. He said that I should've known that he didn't have that much money and declined it from the get-go because ""that's not how you treat your friends."" He just kinda jumped to these points. Now, I felt bad here. I told him that while I was right from a legalistic perspective, I was not being an easy going friend. I said that he didn't have to pay me, I just wanted the remaining parts back. He then proceeded to further clarify how I was being very businesslike and a shit friend for wanting the money.

I thought about it some more, and I am now considering not being friends with him anymore because I feel as if he unfairly put ALL the blame on me. Let's say you are borrowing a laptop from person A and get hit by a car. Laptop breaks, and the person who hit you pays you 250 dollars for it. Person A is out a laptop. To keep that money would be just profiting. It's not your money necessarily, it's for the laptop which belongs to your friend. I believe this is an important distinction to make because I feel like he failed to see that I was being reasonable. It's not like I was taking ""his"" money. Of course, he is poor and ""money is money,"" so maybe I am all the way the asshole?

edit: thanks for your responses! I think most say NTA. I didn't post for validation exactly. I've known the guy since the 6th grade. It's always been in his personality to let his ego and stubbornness get in the way of saying sorry or conceding points in argument. I think that being willing to look beyond your own pov is integral in any relationship. That's the issue in almost all of the AITA posts. Either someone can't look beyond their pov or someone is clearly NTA but is frustrated because they've been denied closure from the stubborn other so can't decide for themselves. He's been my friend for a long time, and we've had a lot of memories. I've always been ""the bigger man"" regarding him and it sucks, but I put up with it because it's just his personality. But maybe I still could've been a better friend. This is kinda the tipping point for me, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't being petty (or the asshole) before I end what has been a valuable friendship to me. Which now typing it out, I'm not so sure if I should anymore"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxbab0	2019-06-06 02:23:40	Teacherthrowaway2764	AITA for inviting the same group of students to have lunch with me (teacher) and not inviting other kids?	"Small AITA. 

I’m an 8th grade history teacher and teach gifted classes across 3 grades (6/7/8). This means I’ve basically taught the same groups of kids for three years and I can get pretty attached to some. 

Our school has a program where students can be “invited” by any teacher to have lunch with them in the classroom instead of the cafeteria. There’s a group of 6-7 students that routinely eat lunch with me because we’ve known each other for a long time and I honestly adore them. We joke around and it’s nice to have them keep me company at lunch. 

Because this group is so tight-knit, they pretty much have a long standing, no-expiry invite to eat lunch with me whenever. But recently a few other students (quieter in class, rarely talk to me) have requested “invites” because they want to work on their homework during this period (allowed but not technically what this time is meant for, which is teacher-student bonding). 

I’ve said no because A) I’ve exhausted my invites on this core group that I’ve known for years and B) I personally prefer having kids who talk to me, not just do their work. 

My husband thinks I should give these other kids a chance but the selfish part of me doesn’t want to give up my little lunch group family. However in recent weeks I’ve had one kid accuse of me “favoring the popular group” because I’m so well acquainted with them. I told him I’m friendly with whoever’s friendly to me back, that I’m human too. 

AITA for wanting to keep my student lunch group among the same group of kids? The school does not mandate much and it’s purely on teacher preference, but just wondering if I’m being an ass. I realize I’m probably being unfair to the quiet kids but I also like to be talked to! Thanks!"	Asshole	0	0

bxb9rx	2019-06-06 02:22:07	Gym_routine	AITA for telling my gym friend “I don’t see much progress” after he showed me a progress picture?	"My friend had a New Year’s resolution to build muscle and “get big” because he’s always been on the scrawny side growing up. 

&#x200B;

He showed me a progress picture of himself from January and he looks almost the same. He said he gained 3 pounds from 128 to 131 pounds, but he really didn’t look look much different. 

&#x200B;

I told him I was proud of him for his commitment but asked him what he was doing at the gym. He said just a bunch of machines and cables and he doesn’t really have a set “routine” to follow. 

&#x200B;

I told him if he was serious about his gains, he should probably follow a routine, because I don't see much progress, and he could be achieving a lot more in the same period of time. I offered to give him one of workout templates (I’m an online fitness coach so I was just going to give a template I gave one of my clients). 

&#x200B;

Well he got really offended that I didn’t see his progress and said I’m an asshole and not that everyone has “bbc genetics” like me. I just wanted to be realistic because I know how demotivating it is to spend hours at the gym to get no results. Am I the asshole for trying to put him on the right path?"	Asshole	0	0
bxb91d	2019-06-06 02:20:13		AITA for not going to my former best friend's 21st birthday party?	"TL;DR at the bottom, on mobile so please excuse any errors.

Bit of background, Former best friend and I had been best mates since year 8 and did everything together, about 5 months ago we had fallen out but this one was a lot worse than the usual petty arguments best mates have, this went from a disagreement to a heated argument to our other mates having to keep us apart, this fight was about a girl I had started dating, it was obvious he'd taken a liking to her and was getting really jealous.

Like I said that incident happened about 5 months ago, since that day we haven't spoken and I've flat out refused to have any contact with him or go out with my other mates it I know he's going too (petty i know) because he did say some pretty nasty things to my and my girlfriend, the insult that upset the most was that he Hope's I die in a friendly fire accident (I'm a rifleman in the Australian army) hearing that from who I thought was my best mate hurt, a lot.

About a week ago FBM (former best mate) sent me an invitation on Facebook to his 21st birthday party, all my other mates are going and all mutual friends are too, I've told my other mates I'm not going, since I told them a lot of my friends/mutual friends have started ignoring me and the ones who arent ignoring me are saying if I dont go then I might as well lose their numbers and never contact them again, only about 5 of my other mates who are going to the party understand why I'm not going or talking to FBM and they were the ones who held FBM and I apart

So AITA here? I know I probably didnt handle it as well as I should have but hearing someone you've been best mates with since year 8 tell you he hopes you die in a friendly fire accident hurts a lot.

TL;DR: Best friend invites me to his 21st birthday party 5 months after telling me he hope's I die, i decline the invitation and my other friends start hating me."	Not the A-hole	1	0

This goes back almost 6 months, I went on a trip to another country with 2 of my best friends for a little over 2 weeks, in that time we met a group of 3 girls which where good friends as well. We hanged out all of us for most part of the days and got really close between some of us, but there was friction between us as well. The friend in question, let’s call him Richard has a girlfriend, they’ve been dating for almost 2 years now and they seem happy together. One of the girls, we’ll call her Sam, liked Richard and he openly told everyone, he knew it and we told him me really shouldn’t do anything with her, he said he’d behave but it seemed like he liked the attention and having her behind his back all the time. 
One time she invited all of us to a small party at her house (we were 9 in total). We started drinking and Richard got drunk really quick (not because he had too much but he just can’t handle it) he usually doesn’t drink and it’s the friend that tries to take care of us, Sam knew he was drunk and took her chance i guess, they disappeared for a good time of the night and then rejoined us as if nothing had happened and Richard told me that he wasn’t drink yet and that they were just talking. 
I try to believe him because I know he loves his girlfriend but then on one of the last days Sam told me what they really did and that she finally got what she wanted, they were still talking a lot and Richard ket teasing Sam, seeking for her attention but I don’t think more happened between them after that.
The trip is over now and we see each other almost daily (because of school) and he is with his girlfriend all the time and he barely wants to hang out with us anymore. It makes me angry to see him all over his girlfriend (they’re one of those couples that show affection whenever they can, even in public) now after knowing what he has done but on the other side i really don’t know what to believe, I really want to believe he didn’t do anything, but by the way he acted on the trip I know something might have indeed happened. 
I’ve asked him numerous times ever since we came back and he always denies doing something but doesn’t like talking about it, Sam on the other hand always tells me happily that she wanted to do something with him and eventually did.

Backstory: I've been dating my boyfriend for just over 2 years, his family has become like my own, and so has his house. I think of it as my second home and try to help out as much as possible with its cleanliness. My boyfriends parents moved to a different state, but come back home every other month or 2 for about a month. My boyfriend and his sister still live at the original house. The parents traveled back to their out of state home on the 2nd, and the sister flew to Hawaii just yesterday.

I got a text from my boyfriend today saying that he just went into the garage for the first time since everyone left, and the freezer was wide open. Everything melted. About $200 worth of food ruined. My first response was ""that was your sister 100%"". He agreed. 

and that got me thinking, how many times his sister has just left things open because she ""forgot to close it"". She's left the fridge open multiple times, as well as some cabinets, which isnt as serious but is a pet peeve of mine. Then I remembered how many times I've come home with my boyfriend, his sister gone, and all the windows are wide open, as well as the 2 sliding doors (one in the living room and one across the house in the parents room). She opens these to get fresh air, then doesnt close them, and leaves for hours. This has happened more than 10 times. 

My own house hasnt been broken into, but people have trespassed into my backyard and stolen a bike and a few skateboards. Its the absolute worst feeling knowing someone has invaded your privacy like that. I kept my window shut for MONTHS no matter how much I missed the natural light. 

I know someday, their house will be broken into if the sister keeps doing this. I would talk to her myself about it, but she's kind of a brat and I know anything I say, will just be replied to with an eyeroll, whereas if her mom and dad said something, she would listen. She doesnt even listen to my boyfriend either. 

The only reason im wondering if im the AH, is whether or not its my place to say anything. I've said something before about a different topic and my boyfriend told me to stay out of it because its none of my business. But I just dont want their lovely home to be broken into :(

He's lived here for approximately four months, while I've only lived here for about two. He got the place with the idea that I would live with him. We planned this out almost as soon as I found out I would be moving to where he lives for work. 

Recently, he had to go home for a month due to a family emergency. I won't go into details, as that's his business, but it left me alone in the apartment for a month.

And I loved it. 

I enjoyed living by myself much more than living with somebody. There's nothing he does in particular; I just enjoyed the freedom of being able to do whatever I want whenever I want without having to worry about him. About a week after he got back, I started looking into other apartments nearby.

The problem is, he got this apartment with the idea that both of us would live here. We know each other, it saves money, etc. I don't think he would be able to find another roommate (and he probably won't want to as he's not a very trusting person.) 

My friend and I have been really close for a long time. Not best friends, but still very good friends. As such, I don't want to screw him over. 

So AITA for wanting to move out?

As you can imagine I was a target for bullying. Not too many guys bullied me, it was mostly girls. Specifically one group of girls. They would make fun of me, make fun of my clothes, my hair, my weight. One day they put a bra in my backpack and then took my backpack and pulled it out and the whole class laughed. Anyways I left that school in 11th grade mainly because of them, I hated it so much. 

Anyways fast forward 10 years. I’ve lost weight, fixed my skin and have worked on my self confidence. Not to brag but I’m a good looking guy, I’m successful and happy. I feel good about the person I am.

Yesterday I was at the grocery store doing my weekly shopping and I hear someone call out my name. I turn and see it’s one of those girls. Let’s call her A. I used to have a minor crush on A, but of course she saw me as nothing but a punching bag. So she walks up to me and starts this friendly chat, which I am not feeling at all. She’s grown into a very beautiful woman, but my crush is long gone and I am starting to feel anger just seeing her face. Especially her bullshit “you look so good” spew. 

After a few minutes I’d had enough and told her that I don’t like her and don’t want to talk to her. She says “what” and then I says “I don’t want to talk to you, you’re a bitch and have 0 chance with me. Don’t ever talk to me again” then I walked off.

bxb1ff	2019-06-06 01:59:25		"AITA for telling my white friend her ""blaccent"" makes me uncomfortable sometimes?"	"I'm a speech-language pathologist (32-year-old white F) who has worked at a special needs school for two years. One of the teachers is “Charlotte” (25-year-old white F). She and I get along well - we talk, vent and joke throughout the day and hung out outside of work once. We text pretty much every day.

I talked to her after school yesterday so she could vent about some stuff. Charlotte often peppers her speech with expressions that I would characterize as ""stereotypically black"". Like ""Get it, girl!"", ""Bitch, please!"", ""Why you tryna...,"" ""Don't play me,"" etc. She does this several times in a short convo. She changes her intonation and includes mannerisms (snapping, moving her hand/body). After our talk, I left work and we were texting later. She apologized for being negative and I said I didn’t find her negative, I just thought she was cursing a lot and saying questionable things. When she asked what she said, I said several times I wanted to tell her in person. She was insistent and was becoming anxious and said she couldn’t focus on studying so I felt like I had no choice. I prefaced it by repeating I did NOT want to share this info via text.

*Me: I just wanted to say sometimes I feel a little uncomfortable with the ""black"" accent that you do a lot. And I know your intention is just to say things in a fun way. But I think it can come across as co-opting the language (AAVE, African American Vernacular English) of a marginalized community without having to deal with the same struggles. And I think it probably depends on what you say sometimes.*

I said I just wanted to share that with her and apologized if that was hurtful. I just wanted to answer her question honestly. I also said I was worried she was going to be mad at me. She said she wasn’t mad, just a bit frustrated and didn’t know how to respond. But then she said when she was younger she had a stutter that would come out in group settings and talking in fun ways made her feel less nervous. She also said she has been the “minority” in her friend group since the first day of H.S. and she “assimilated” to the people she surrounded herself with.

Lastly, she said:

*C: Do I mean to be offensive? Absolutely not. Does talking in fun ways make me feel comfortable and enjoy having conversations with all people? Absolutely. It’s not something I’m conscious of and I don’t do it with black people in my mind. It just happens and I’m unapologetic for it because that’s just how I talk. I am very much aware about the struggles of those who are marginalized and stand up for those who have those struggles.*

We haven’t talked in person yet.

* About 1/2 of the adults and students in our program are African American.
* I take issue with her use of the word “minority”. Also see the third comment in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/brdw6o/why\_is\_it\_okay\_for\_blacks\_to\_sound\_white\_but\_not/).

bxb185	2019-06-06 01:58:53	2148572	WIBTA if I stop talking to my friend for a bit?	"So it's kind of a long story, I \[M 17\] am best friends with a girl. She has a boyfriend. I became friends with her after she started dating her boyfriend and both of us understand and respect boundaries. I wouldn't even joke about ""stealing her from him"" or anything to that effect.

&#x200B;

Our friendship consists mostly of us sharing feelings and supporting one another. We have shared everything about ourselves to each other, from our sex lives to deeply emotional thoughts. She was always kind and respectful and tried her hardest when helping me, and I do my best to reciprocate.

&#x200B;

\*THIS IS ALL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, SO I COULD BE CROWDING OUT SOME THINGS, TAKE THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT\*

&#x200B;

I don't know how to express this without jacking myself off about how good of a friend I am, but I do dedicate a lot of my time to making sure she's doing well. I try to help her with a lot of things that I can, we study together for our classes, with me mostly explaining various concepts, and really I do all that I can to make sure that she is doing her best.

&#x200B;

I have been noticing a pattern. It's been going on since as early as January, I think. But whenever her and her boyfriend have a fight, or can't be close for whatever reason, she gets really close to me. Like, ""breaking every rule about boundaries she had set"" close. However, when she does spend time with him, she almost completely forgets about me. She just seems distant. She wouldn't answer texts for something like 12 hours at a time. (Yes I know that it's not a lot of time, but we are teens who are always on their phones, it's a lot for us. Especially when normally we text each other back within the hour).

&#x200B;

Just yesterday, however, I was at her house and we were working on a project together, a school project. About halfway through, I break down. (I'm not looking for a therapy session here, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and this shit + finals is fucking with me)

&#x200B;

I then express to her how I've been feeling. And she responds, in the most monotone voice you can imagine, with what could be summarized as ""wow that sucks"". I wasn't expecting her to get on the ground in tears and console me, but she wasn't responsive at all to anything I was saying. I would have had more emotional support if I had talked to the grass outside my house.

&#x200B;

In a mix of tears, anger, and frustration, I walk out. I later text her letting her know all that I said above, and how I feel about how our friendship ebbs and flows and it's not something I can deal with. She then mentioned that her boyfriend had told her to spend less time with me, because we're getting too close and that doesn't make him comfortable. I understand and respect that and feel like it would have been nice to have been notified of that.

&#x200B;

So I decided I needed some time to myself and let her know that we wouldn't talk for a weekish, until i get my thoughts figured out. AITA for doing that? Should I have given her the benefit of the doubt?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxazos	2019-06-06 01:54:37	SomehowIManagedit	AITA for attending a college induction as a past student and being honest	"TLDR - Last year past students used scare mongering to make their 'achievement' look better. I'd like to tell them I hardly put in any effort and managed it.


I attended a pretegious university for a Master's Degree. This was all done online but we were required to attend one day early on for some information.


During that day I remember hearing from past students of the course who were all very into the idea of having the chance to speak. By which I mean, these are the exact type of people your expect would agree to come in at 9am on a Saturday to talk about a course they have finished. 


They went on about all the generic crap you'd expect. How much studying it required, how difficult it was, how rewarding it is. One even said we shouldn't take much time off for Christmas because we would fall behind. I could tell the new students were overwhelmed.


Well, it was a load of bollox. I managed to finish with a 2.1 while doing fuck all work. (Edit since people are discussing it. A 2.1 is just below 'Exceptional' in my country. To score higher than a 2.1 your work has to be 'exceptional') I started every assignment on the Friday when they were due Monday. I submitted my last 4 a week late taking the 5% penalty. 


I didn't tune in for the classes, read the notes or the required reading. I just answered the questions and found sources to reference. Somehow that got me good scores, I believe they just don't put much effort into the grading. I haven't spoke to anyone who failed. 


Well, now they are asking for people from my year to do these talks. I want to go and tell them to ignore what everyone is going to tell them. It's not going to engulf your life. Don't ignore family and holidays. I want to tell them they'll be fine if they put in a little work. I didn't get through it by a massive amount of hard work or genius. I got through it because the college wanted people to get through it.


I imagine the staff won't be happy with my story, nor will the other past students who think they did great."	Asshole	0	0
bxaxyg	2019-06-06 01:50:03	Lolem	AITA for Wanting to End This Friendship?	"Long story, but I'll narrow it down to the key points:

1. Gay guy here.  Lost my partner in early 2017 due to cancer.
2. Fell into a deep depression.  Concerned friends pointed me to an in-person grief group for gay men.
3. Started attending said group in June 2017.  Some positives, some negatives.  Overall pretty helpful.
4. At the group I met another widower I'll refer to as Ben.
5. One afternoon in late summer 2017 Ben sent an email to everyone in the group saying that he was in a bad place emotionally and would someone (anyone) reach out to him.  I gave him a call and we became friendly.  Grief is a strong bond.  We started having dinner together from time to time - once a month or so.
6. I stopped attending the grief group in early 2018.  Lots of different reasons, not really important here.  But remained friendly with Ben.
7. The more I hung out with Ben the more I learned about him.  Some stuff is kind of disturbing.  I'd rather not get into too much detail here, but he would often say that he's ""too much"" for most people.
8. Over time I knew that I was getting ""better"" faster than Ben.  Grief is different for everyone.  I started to feel a little uncomfortable around him.  Our dinners became less frequent.
9. A few days ago he sent me an email asking ""have I driven you away?  I can handle the truth.""

I don't really know how to handle this.  Honestly, I feel like the question itself has kind of driven me away.  Am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bxaxhl	2019-06-06 01:48:46	therealawol	AITA for letting my father give away my sister's rabbit?	"So about 4 months ago, my sister bought a rabbit. She took pretty good care of it, and I took care of the rabbit when she wasn't home. 2 months ago, she moved across the country to go to college, and she didn't take her rabbit because she forgot to take her to the vet to get her immunized before she left (immunization records were required to bring any pets aboard an airplane). So, she went off to college, and left the rabbit over here.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I'm still feeding the rabbit, taking care of her and what not. Then, my dad brings up his decision to give her away. He says he has a friend who owns a farm, and his friend is interested in buying my sisters rabbit. I tell my dad that its a bad idea, as my sister was planning to come visit soon and take her to the vet so she could bring her this time. I tell him that she will be pissed, but he does it anyway. At this point there's really nothing I can do, so I pretty much shrug it off.

That is until 30 minutes ago, when my sister texts me saying, ""Why did you let dad give my rabbit away?"" It turns out that my dad didn't tell her that he was giving her rabbit away until tonight (I didn't know that he didn't tell her). So we go back and fourth about this, she's basically saying I should have done more to keep her, and I'm telling her that there was nothing I could do. She's pissed off at my dad, understandably, but I don't get why she is mad at me. I did not have a say in the matter at all, my father is stubborn like that.

bxax4q	2019-06-06 01:47:44	coolblue79	WIBTA If I gave my wife's brother a reality check?	"This is a bit of a long story, so bear with me on this one. 

My wife's brother is almost 30 and has been a drug addict for more than a decade - mostly soft drugs and prescription meds. They come from a rather patriarchal culture where a man is forgiven virtually all indiscretions and most men are in fact entitled man-childs that see nothing wring about their digressions. 

Her brother also spent just over 3 years in prison for a crime that he did not commit. In some ways I'd say he was still responsible for this due to the company he keeps and since the night he was picked up he was out to fuel his addiction after being clean for a couple of months. He's been out of prison since a few months and has been relatively clean of the prescription pill habit since. Due to his wrongful incarceration he's also suffering from depression and is currently under treatment for it. 

I've perhaps painted quite a sorry picture of the guy, but this is where my dilemma comes in. I've been married to my wife for over 6 years now and ever since I've known him he justifies his various digressions / indiscretions by saying that he's a 'man'. This is a cultural norm in their country. 

The problem my wife's family faces now is that her brother wastes a ton of money on cigarettes (3 to 4 packets a day) and soft drugs without the slightest regard to the emotional and financial impact on the family. There is still this massive sense of entitlement in him with which he justifies his spendings. He does have a job now but thats barely enough to cover even half his expenses. His mother tries to drive some sense into him but to know avail (their father died quite a while ago). 

What's my interest in all this? 
-I look upon my wife's mother as my own mum and hate to see her family go through their daily struggles with her (biological) son. 
-My wife is clinically depressed since shortly after we conceived our first child. Her brother's situation and shenanigans (among other things) have been a huge impediment in her path to recovery 


Why I haven't already given some tough love to my wife's brother? 
-He's probably going through a ton of s*** inside due to his wrongful imprisonment. And perhaps his behaviour is a defense mechanism. If I call him out, it might break him. 
-I'm a foreigner and an outsider in that sense to these people. Although my wife's family has tremendous love and respect for me, I might burn a lot of bridges if I speak with him. 

What I want to do: Have a hard talk with him about his spending habits, general demenour and the fact that he needs to get his life back on track soon otherwise life's just going to pass him by. WIBTA if I did that?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Recently got close to this guy 3 weeks ago, he needed a place to stay in my city for Friday/Saturday nights for work for ~2 months. He was desperate so I accepted since he was gonna pay me in return. He's a decent guy overall except he makes 1-2 jokes about mental illness every time we talk where it becomes the punchline (e.g. ""haha oops my biploar came out""). Perpetuating the stigma of mental illness is NOT okay with me, but I let it slide these times with each time hoping he'd stop if he realized I didn't laugh. It's weird because he's applying for medical school and should know better. I snapped when I joked about him being disloyal by watching a TV episode before I did and he said ""I'll give you AIDS""....Now I feel VERY uncomfortable because its almost an inherent joke about the 4 letter r-word (reddit won't let me type it).....I'm a girl.

bxawr8	2019-06-06 01:46:43		WIBTA for quitting my job right after they paid for a few certifications for me?	"I’ve been working for my local park district for the past 4 years (year-round, not just summers) as a lifeguard and swim instructor. Every May they do lifeguard recertification, and this year they had us do a new swim instructor certification program. So they, like, *just* paid for me to get two certifications. But I’m really unhappy with how everything’s being run, and I’m tempted to resign. Here are a few of the issues I’ve encountered in the past few weeks:

- sometimes they schedule me to be in two different places at the same time. This is very frustrating, for obvious reasons. 

- I feel like I’m underpaid. I discovered this when my best friend just got a job as a swim instructor for a different employer in the same area. His *starting* pay, as a 17-year-old with no experience in the workforce, is higher than my *current* wage as an 18-year-old with 4 years of aquatic employment experience. I did some research and found that most of the surrounding park districts would pay me about 10% more than I currently make for the same job, given my qualifications.

- at the outdoor pool, the managers are total wimps about pool closing. They’ll sometimes close the pool for the whole day just because the weather in the morning wasn’t great. And then the afternoon turns out to be beautiful weather, but too bad, they’ve already closed the pool. This has happened twice in the past week. And this means I lose hours, because I can’t work when the pool’s closed. So I’ll start the week expecting to get 40 hours worth of pay, and end up with less than that because some of my shifts got cancelled for dumb reasons. 

These are just the new developments. There are a lot of other things I’ve been putting up with for months or years, but I figured every job has its pitfalls so I should just stick it out. But then these three things happened *in addition to* those other problems. 

In short, I’m dissatisfied with my current employment situation. But my employers did just invest two certifications’ worth of funds in me. I’m not sure how much that costs, but it’s probably a lot. I feel like it’d be selfish to quit now.

My aunt got me into the company we both work for and we are currently in the same position. There is only one way for us to grow in our company and as such we talked about how we both wanted to eventually move up and I even flat out asked her if she was going to be ok if I applied for any promotions and she said that it was fine. Well the time came sooner than either of us anticipated when we both got a call yesterday from our manager to notify us that a position unexpectedly opened and they would be having interviews today and making a decision tomorrow. I was ecstatic and immediately called her with the news and that's when everything changed. She didn't know I was getting interviewed too and she was acting really off. I could tell she wasn't happy and eventually after 10 mins of beating around the bush I flat out asked her if she was upset I was being interviewed. And that's when she told me that she would quit if I got promoted before her. Not that she would quit if she didn't get promoted... only if I got promoted before her. So if somebody else got the job it was fine.  I asked her if she wanted me to rescind my acceptance for the interview and she said no but it was all really passive aggressive for the rest of the conversation before it was finally so awkward that I got off the phone. 

We had interviews today and I wished her luck and I told her I would be happy if either one of us got the job. And I called her after our interviews  to see how it went for her and we both felt good about it. However, she kept asking me questions to get info on my interview but was really secretive and wouldn't answer my questions... 

I love my aunt but I really want this job. But half of me wants for her to get it just so that I dont have to keep worrying about us having to compete  every time a similar position opens. 

So AITA? Part of me thinks so because she helped get me the job and she's my aunt and my elder but I'm conflicted because I SPECIFICALLY asked her before this promotion even came up if she would be ok if I went after promotions and she said yes! 

TLDR: Aunt and I both interviewed for the same promotion. She helped me get into the company in the first place. I asked her if she was ok with me applying for promotions and she initially said yes but now that it's actually come up she says she will quit if I get the job before her. I really want the job but can't help but feel like I'm doing something wrong."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I don't think I cut anyone off, and I was driving the limit. As I was getting out and walking in, I hear angry yelling behind me. I turn around, and an old lady is absolutely livid and shaking with anger, and staring at me, yelling from a few meters away loudly ""LEARN HOW TO DRIVE, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE FUCKING GOING"" and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember. Normally I'd apologize, but I was initially super confused and thought she had the wrong person. She also didn't make it clear what I did wrong.. I really didn't see anything happen. It's possible I could have cut her off? But I really don't think I did. Anyway, I responded saying ""Wow, it's really appropriate of you to yell at me instead of coming over and talking to me like a civil adult."" And she responded, ""WHAT?!"" with a really angry expression on her face. I said, ""it's not appropriate to be yelling at a stranger."" She walked away towards where she was going, and two random guys who were having a smoke and overheard everything chimed in and said ""yeah actually, it is appropriate. Maybe learn how to fucking drive asshole."" I doubt those guys witnessed anything that even possibly happened, based off how far we were from the actual parking lot. They seemed to just agree based on her anger, and my response to her yelling. I felt super picked on and hurt after this. Why do people start screaming at other drivers over petty things? And what would have been the best way to respond.. Lastly, I'd like to know, AITA? Was she right to yell even if I did do something wrong?"	Not enough info	0	0

Example of the situations where I tell her to stop looking:

1. There is a fight breaking out. My mom will stop not too far and will look how it turns out.
2. A crazy person on the train is screaming and shouting. She will look at him/her.
3. Police are arresting someone/stoping someone’s car. My mom will again stop to see what’s going on. 
4. People shouting at each other.

Basically, I feel like in those types of situations, it’s inappropriate to look, so I tell her to stop and keep going. Sometimes she agrees and stops, but sometimes she gets angry that I try to control her. I just feel like if I was being arrested, or if I was fighting with someone on the street, I wouldn’t want to have people stop around me and take their time looking.

AITA?

Edit: I don’t only stop her from looking because I feel bad for other people, but I’m also afraid that because she is looking, the people that she is looking at might get angry at her for looking (how many times did I say look? Haha) and may hurt her."	Asshole	0	0

bxatb6	2019-06-06 01:37:28	meghab1792	AITA for calling bf’s friends out on BS behavior?	"My bf and I have been together for about four years, and I inherited a semi large group of of his long time friends when we began dating. I have a lot of positive things to say about most of them but they grew up in a vastly different culture than I did (I grew up in a lovely mountainous blue state with lots of things to do and they are from a very boring, and drug laden, southern, red state.)
I am a female and the group just so happens to have a lot more men than women, so it can be tough to build the girl friendships I like to have. 

A few months ago, one of the groups couples (we’ll call them Cathy and Seth) ended up breaking up after about 6 years together. It turned out Cathy cheated on Seth with two separate male members of the group (we’ll call them Cain and Dylan).  Dylan happened to be one of Cathy and Seth’s roommates at the time, which made things even worse. 

S was very understandably devastated, as was my BF, watching S endure all this pain. Watching 2 thirty year old men cry over feelings isn’t something you see everyday. S ended up sleeping on our couch for about two weeks as we were the closest available friends to him. 

D then proceeds to essentially mock S on every social media platform, as well as to other friends in the group and make S so uncomfortable that he felt that he could no longer even sleep in his own house. 

As the weeks go on, and S moves away to a life changing job training program and Cathy moves back to red hillbilly state. D continues to mock S and begins to make several inappropriate and misogynistic posts as well.

At this point, I messaged D and told him I couldn’t take his shit posting anymore and I was unfriending him on social media. No one else in the friend group would even really condemn his actions and were happy to pretend like nothing even happened and acted like we just magically lost two integral friends for no reason.

D did not respond to the message but every time we’re going to the same event, he stirs the pot by pre-talking shit to mutual friends before I show up (please keep in mind how ridiculous this entire situation is, especially because we all range in age 25-34). 

My boyfriend tries to stay neutral, verbally but acts very standoffish to D and Cain. I’m not angry with him, he’s just incredibly non-confrontational. In private he’s expressed support for my actions and opinions.

Side note: Cain and I also don’t get along because of his violent alcoholism and my unwillingness to enable his destructive behavior (we’re talking 4 DUIs and actually being HIT by a car and shattering a leg, needing surgery, all while drunk). He’s sober now, but seems very uninterested in creating a relationship with me (that I tried to create post sober and pre cheating scandal) and is happy to just try and ignore me and spurn my attempts at conversation.

I no longer maintain any sort of relationship with Cathy.

So, AIMTA for not staying quiet and becoming somewhat confrontational when I see people act like this?

Edit: the reason I thought I might be TA is because most of the others in the friend group consider me the “mean” one for rocking the boat about these things."	Not the A-hole	0	0

This week I got home in between meetings and she wasn’t there. There was some crud in the kitchen sink, and a few other very small issues. Just not quite the same vibe as before. So I asked her how long she was there, since I was home and she was already gone. 
She worked for 2.5 hours and told me she prices per house, not per hour, which is fine, but not how I remembered the discussion. She was very apologetic that the clean wasn’t up to par and stopped by later to fix it up, her idea. 
She felt really bad, and I let her know we are still very happy with her services, and I just wanted to have good communication so we have a good relationship.

bxaqmz	2019-06-06 01:29:57	JovanTheUnknown	AITA for telling my friend that i thought some girl liked him?	" 

first post on Reddit, so don't judge

&#x200B;

Anyway, this story happened a few months ago, so I might've forgotten some details, but the story goes like this:

Over the course of a few months, i suspected that this girl in my class, we'll call her G, liked my best friend, we'll call him T. Me and G would constantly say that we were a better friend to T than the other person. Normally I wouldn't care too much because i knew she was joking, but i started noticing other stuff that she would do (again, this happened a few months ago, so i don't remember exactly what she did, but I could tell she liked him). so being a good friend, I told him what i thought. He would always doubt me or just say 'OK'. So a month or so later, we were sitting in french class, and at the table were Me, T, friend of G, and 2 other girls. We came across the topic of who liked who, and eventually came across who liked T, and I said ""G likes T"". Keep in mind, noone told me this, and i was basing this purely off of observations i made. But anyway, Friend of G goes apeshit and says ""what the hell dude, you weren't supposed to tell anyone"" (which confirmed my suspicion all along), and then proceeds to tell G about what I did. I'm assuming friend of G got really mad because he thought I just ""spilled her secret to her crush"" even though I already told T my observations months ago. A few minutes later I saw G crying, and I felt kinda bad (I didn't know if it was about what I said or not), but honestly, I don't really think I'm to blame here. What do you guys think? AITA?"

"Okay, so context, my friend works at a mexican restaurant, and she asked me if I wanted to meet up, as her work place wasn't busy. I said yes, and had my mom drop me off, she told me I wouldn't be able to ask her to pick me up for at least an hour, but no biggie, the restaurant isn't busy, I can keep myself entertained. WRONG. As soon as I get there, other people show up, fine, no biggie, they'l leave and I can get back to chatting.  Haha, NOPE! As soon as they left, more people showed up... And more... And more, and it got to the point where I just accepted we weren't going to speak, but I couldn't leave, as my mom would complain about it, so I stuck it out and assumed that maybe the line would be dealt with, and I would at least get 5 minutes. It seemed god smiled down on me, as the promise land grew quiet, I thought that it was our time to shine... Turns out, she had other duties, ones I were not made aware of. I had waited an hour and thirty minutes, and in that entire time, I had only gotten about 2 sentences out of her. She never apologized for not talking to me, not even as she CLEANED UNDERNEATH ME! She never spoke a single word to me after it got busy, even when it wasn't busy. It got to a point where I felt dead inside and didn't care about the 2 families going into the restaurant back to back. I'm not even angry we didn't speak, I'm angry that I wasn't cautioned about us not being able to speak, she's worked there for several months and as such, knows her duties, and she didn't think to let me know?

The lady who had the ad on Craigslist asked for $1000 for the room with no utilities included.  She had an a.c. When I moved in. I did not. I signed a lease with the landlord upon moving in.  It was agreed that we ( two tenants) agree to pay 1800 on the first of every month.  I have venmoed her the money and paid 1000 extra over time for my last month of rent (this August)  The apartment is a three bedroom. Her son  has his stuff in the third ( much bigger) bedroom.  He also parks his car in one of the two allotted spots in while he is away at college about 10 miles away. He is now back in the apartment. I put an a.c. In the window hadn’t even plugged it in. And she comes at me. And says “ I see you put an a.c. In.. you have to pay me more now.  I said I don’t think that’s fair. And then she went off about how she pays all the utilities etc.. I should have told her I wanted to put it in, etc. I think I should keep it in and not pay any extra. AITA?	Not enough info	1	0

bxam33	2019-06-06 01:17:07		AITA for making an uncomfortable situation even more uncomfortable?	"Firsty, I have to acknowledge that I do say too much sometimes and from what my best friend tells me, I can be quite unaproachable at times due to my lack of patience for people. I used to argue with the majority of my teachers throughout elementary and high school. I imagine I seem aggressive to people that don't know me well, but this is something I am trying to work on. 

Nevertheless, this situation happened a few months ago.
 
One of our friends owns a tiny, local ""kafana"" (cafe/pub). After he closed the place, 5 of us stayed in and we kept drinking. Of those 5, there was just one guy that wasn't regularly hanging out with us, but he was fine. The night was going great until the new guy and one of my friends started having a petty argument. The problem that I had wasn't with their ""fight"", rather with how it made everyone else feel, including myself. They weren't directly insulting one another, it was the classic passive-aggressive poking fun of each other. Since everyone else was quiet except for the two of them, another friend  (that is known for being a ""clown"" and is always the funny one) tries to draw the attention to himself and he starts goofing around. But the new guy keeps switching back to the same subject and he kept making fun of the girl, that happened at least three times. 
I was sitting there, completely quiet, listening to the whole ordeal until I got fed up and snapped. I said in a very serious voice: ""both of you should shut the fuck up and chill out, especially you (looking at the new guy)""
Can't remember word for word, but I explained that everyone felt uncomfortable and that he was a prick for not noticing when people obviously wanted to move on to something else. The situation went from weird to weirder because he started apologizing and giving weak excuses.

The girl that was arguing with him was on board with me 100%, but the other guys didn't say anything as we just slowly and awkwardly moved on to a different topic. I felt like I overdid it a bit, but then again she was supportive and I felt like he deserved it.

So a few months back my friend and I agreed to go to this concert together. It was a pretty hefty commitment because the tickets were $400. I have this feeling she’s gonna bail on me, and I need to know if I’m an asshole in this situation. We haven’t been on the best of terms and we just don’t see each other or talk really anymore. She’s always been the type to bail on me for one of her many Tinder “boyfriends” and this time I feel like she is gonna come up with an excuse last minute and say she can’t go. She already paid me for the ticket, and if she bails on me last minute I wasn’t going to pay her back for the ticket, I just wouldn’t take her and take someone else instead. 

Granted, if she has a valid excuse like she’s sick or something that’s one thing. But if she bails for me and goes out with someone else I don’t feel any regard for giving her her money back. So WIBTA if I didn’t give her the money back and took someone else instead if she gave an invalid reason she couldn’t come with me? 

TLDR: friend paid for concert ticket, will probably bail, WIBTA for not giving her the money back?

Edit: Understandable, I’d be the asshole if I just blatantly took somebody else and didn’t pay her back. If she bails I’m gonna give her the ticket and go on my own. Thanks everyone!"	Asshole	0	0

Yesterday she asked me if I need a “date” to pride. I told her I’m going with a girl I’ve been seeing and a few friends but she was more than welcome to come. I added I was surprised she was interested in going to pride and asked if her boyfriend was coming. That’s when she dropped the bomb. Her and her boyfriend have been talking about having a threesome. She said it’s great I’ve been seeing someone and asked if any of my friends were cute and “not too butchy.” She went on to say her boyfriend isn’t coming so she has better chances of finding someone, and she’s already planning a cute rainbow outfit. 

I’m waiting to reply. I feel pretty fucking offended by the whole thing. First because she knows I would never ever be down for that kind of thing. Second because she’s really thinking she can come around my fairly radical queer friends and pedal this shit. Third because the non butchy comment hits a nerve. 

She did something similar about a year ago where she approached me about a threesome, but it was much less direct. Two strikes makes me really question if we’re even friends at all or if this is some weird shit. 

I’m considering just not replying and waiting to see if she sees the problem and apologizes. We’ve been friends for ten years so I don’t want to trash the friendship but.... like come on. 🤦🏻‍♀️

*identifies as straight, has only been with men, and only expresses interest in women in a threesome scenario (I assume at her boyfriends request.)

So at the end of the day I express my frustration and he tries offers encouragement by saying once I’m there longer I’ll get to do stuff. Now I snap back “I’ve been here longer” which is a debatable statement. To explain, I started job first but he previously had an unpaid internship in a different department doing completely different work. Well, he gets pissed and storms off and walked home (not super far) rather than ride with me. 

I text him later apologizing for what and how I said.

We have a guy that is very handsome and plays lacrosse in the spring and football in autumn. He isn’t the most popular guy but he does hook up with a lot of girls. As in like, a new one every weekend.

Me and my friend group have discussed him and borderline worshiped him - mostly his charisma and physique although TBH he isn’t a very smart guy...

Anyways. I had the opportunity to hook up with him last night after we went to see a movie together. And lmfao holy crap was his penis tiny. It’s like the size of my little 4 year old brothers lmao. Not only that pathetic but he also nutted mad quick. Like barely got a pump and a half in. He was mad embarrassed and offered to at least go down on me so I could orgasm but honestly like due to the entire fucking let down of this hot guy having a literal micro penis, I just wasn’t feeling it. I left soon after.

My friends wanted to know about our hookup like ASAP so I texted them as soon as I got home. I told them the truth - that he has the tiniest dick I have ever seen in my entire life (I’ve seen about 8 honestly in person but a ton in porn). I even told them that my little brothers penis was bigger lmao.

Well. Today in school word went around quick about Casanova’s little peen and the dude is legit pissed at me and his twin sister is sending my borderline death threats on Facebook and talking about how her cousin is a lawyer and a bunch of legal crap. I don’t think anything is a crime so what the fuck ever.

Like legit I don’t understand how he could ever please a woman with that pathetic piece. So I feel like I am doing a public service so that women like me don’t have to waste their time with such a loser lmao.

I [18M] am bisexual, with a preference for dudes and currently dating a guy [20M]. There's a girl who is new to my friend group, let's call her Kelly [18F] who I've never particularly cared for. Not to stereotype but she's kinda your archetypal weeby ""geek girl"" type if you know what I mean, all anime shirts, no knowledge of boundaries and not showering so often. I always found her very annoying but ultimately harmless.

Recently, however, that changed. I'm out to my friends and they all know/hang with my boyfriend, however it's commin knowledge amongst them that my parents and sister are incredibly religious and use that to justify being homophobic so under *no* circumstances do we talk about my sexuality to them. Yes, Kelly is new to the group but we don't make any secret of this fact. A couple of weeks ago, a bunch of us went to a charity event. Kelly, myself and my sister went for a smoke and Kelly mentioned my boyfriend, referring to him as such. I tried to laugh it off like ""she means my friend who's a boy"" but she just looked confused and went ""you're dating though"". My sister laughed to save face in public, but told our dad as soon as we got home. I don't think I can talk about his reaction per rule 5 but I'll let y'all imagine for yourselves. I'm currently staying at my boyfriend's and will note I am safe for anyone who might wory. 

The night it happened, I called Kelly and went *off*. I yelled at her for about fifteen minutes straight, telling her that this was all her fault and why couldn't she just have kept her goddamn mouth shut. I also called her some names, which I admit was wrong of me and have apologised for. She got really upset because she doesn't like being yelled at and she it was an accident, it just slipped out without her thinking. I'm not having that as an ""excuse"" and am refusing to talk to/have anything to do with her from here on out. Some of our friends think I'm being mean, but she basically fucked me over by not thinking before she speaks and I don't think I'm being unreasonable by wanting to cut her out."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxafgq	2019-06-06 00:59:30	Slodie	WIBTA if I send an email to my employer to rant about a colleague?	"Hi everyone. I'm French and working as a freelancer for an American company. They hired me, and few other creators for a written job (language application) and an editor to edit our content.

However, this editor has really bad grammar / written skills. She always adds mistakes in my content, or say my texts aren't good or that I didn't do my research properly, but I always check afterwards and she's almost all the time wrong. (when I am, usually it's about policy issues, not grammar or content mistake, and I correct it immediately) 

The work we do is in French, so my American clients only have the editor's feedback to judge my work. Because she complained about my content not being good, having mistakes (which is NOT true), they now want her to check everything I do, and for me to rewrite everything according to her comments. 

I'm working for an application, and users are often complaining about the grammar mistakes within the app, so I can imagine she's not doing her editor's job properly. We have one content creator known for her poor language skills but the editor never corrects his grammar mistakes (I was a French language teacher so I can see those kind of mistakes immediately).

She reviewed my written work and basically asked me to redo the whole thing, without any logical reason. It's a month of work and I won't get paid until I modify it, otherwise they won't approve my payment. She even put some advice on how she would have written it, when she cannot even write a full sentence without bad grammar. 

I feel it's completely unjustified. I never said anything about how I found it odd to have an editor who couldn't write properly working for a learning language application (French). My American employers, who are very nice people, are starting to pick on my nerves and believing everything she's saying, cause they have no way to understand what I do.

I want to send them an email and explain to them everything, of course without being rude, but WIBTA if I tell them she cannot even write properly in French and she has no clue what she's doing? Is it fair to ask a freelancer to redo an entire month of work based on an editor's comments about how I could have phrased it differently? They initially told me they wouldn't pay the content which are not conformed to policy, but now it seems I have to do everything all over again, when there is clearly no policy issue anymore. 

I have no idea what is acceptable in the American work environment, cause in France, it's pretty much allowed to be harsh (politely) to a client or employer. But the American team was very friendly and I'm not sure I can be as blunt with them. Also, is it so bad to talk about the editor? I usually never do that, and I refrained myself from saying anything for months, but this is starting to seriously impact my job.

So, WIBTA to tell them I'm seriously doubting her ability to review my work?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxaf4b	2019-06-06 00:58:37	SecretExThrowaway	AITA for not telling my coworker about my relationship with his fiancée?	"I kinda thought this was a cut and dry thing, but having talked about it with a few other people I'm getting wildly different opinions, so I've decided to ask this here.

One of my coworkers is getting married in a few months. He and I had chatted about his fiancée before, but until this past weekend, I'd never met her. But I ran into them outside of work this weekend at a park, and as it turns out, I know his fiancée. We dated for a time in high school. But when we were chatting and all she said was that I was friend from high school, I just went with that. I figured there was no real point in mentioning that we'd dated.

However, I've since heard from people (both mutual friends from high school and  a few people that I've told this story to) that they think it's a major dick move of me not to tell him. Frankly, I don't see any point to it -- we dated almost fifteen years ago (and if it's relevant, things ended more because we both got busy with schoolwork and extracurriculars and didn't have time to date, so it was a pretty amicable split), and this was the first time I'd even seen her since graduation. From where I'm standing, all me telling him would do is potentially piss him off and start drama.

This is a two fold AITA. 

I just went to a very busy park with my family (pregnant wife and two kids). It’s probably one of the busiest parking lots in the large city where I live. Always tons of people.

I was having trouble paying for parking on a city run parking app, so I sent my family ahead to get in line for food at the park. I can’t get the app to work, so I get out and walk to a payment machine. 

As I’m walking, I happen to look into the backseat of a car and see, plain as day, a guy receiving oral sex (in an SUV covered in stickers for a local large construction company, no less). Keep in mind, this is a very busy family friendly place, and it’s 4:30 in the afternoon. I’m no prude and I don’t want to totally ruin the guy’s day, so I just yell “what the fuck, we can all see you”, and I keep walking.

30 seconds later, the guy gets out of his car (while clearly adjusting his erection in his waistband- gross), and starts yelling at me in front of my kids. He says no one could see them and I should just mind my own business. He is getting aggressive and close.

I tell him I’m going to call the cops if he doesn’t back down. He doesn’t back down. So, I call the cops. They come and tell me I can leave. No idea what they did with him.

After all of this, my wife is mad at me because I created a dangerous situation. I get it that I probably should have just kept my mouth shut, but I think shitty behavior should be called out. No way I could have anticipated it would turn out like this, or maybe not? I don’t know; that’s why I’m here. 

So, AITA for calling this guy out? AITA for calling the cops? AITA for calling and emailing this guys company (I just just had to, who wouldn’t just immediately drive away in shame???).

Edit: I was advised to post this comment here as it helps explain some things - He was following me. I told him to walk away or I would call the cops. He wouldn’t back down so I called the cops. I wouldn’t have notified his employer if not for the aggressive behavior."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bxadg3	2019-06-06 00:53:53		AITA for not wanting to continue dating a guy over his badly behaved dog?	"This has been plaguing my mind all day as I have a date with the guy in question tonight.

Met this guy, we will call him Tommy. He is totally my type, I was immediately physically attracted to him, had a lot in common, he seemed really interested in me when we first met, we both were stumbling over words and getting along quite nicely. He was super respectful, and is a really reserved guy which is the opposite to me, but i liked it a lot and found it endearing. We had a couple dates and then on the third date he brought his dog along for me to meet.

The little guy was super cute, a little fluffball with an adorable bandana around his neck. I was genuinely excited as we headed off to the park to hang out and grab some smoothies. As soon as we arrived at the park, his dog wouldn't stop barking. He joked a little about how he was just excited, but there was no tail wags, just barking and lunging at people all hyper and aggressive. I didn't think much of it, as a person who doesn't have my own dog at home I figured it was normal when you take a dog to the park. But it never stopped. We took a 30 minute walk which felt like an eternity because his barking and growling was constant and annoying. It was clearly driving people crazy after a while, at first they laughed and said ""oooh look at this tough little guy"" and would attempt to pet him to calm down and he would go ballistic... and then they just ignored him and stood in line trying to tune him out.

It started to become clear that Tommy was totally oblivious to the dogs behaviour. He would smile around at everyone with this ""isn't he so cute"" expression. I paid for our smoothies because he had to take the dog away from a couple terriers that were in line. When i came out with the drinks, he was holding the dog and it lunged and chomped down on my straw and finger. I don't get easily irritated but it was getting too much, and Tommy was oblivious and telling stories about how clever this little dog was. Later on as we walked back, the manic barking just kept going. Tommy then told me about these annoying neighbours he has who hate dogs and complain about his dog all the time. Suddenly his reserved and meek nature was becoming a lot less attractive to me. By the end of the date, i was so happy for him to be dropping me off, and when he leaned in to kiss me goodnight i just couldn't get into it. For the next couple days I've been really torn about cancelling my date with him.

It seems really shallow to suddenly have no interest in dating this dude based on his dog. The thought of having to go out in public with such a badly behaved dog and/or potentially move in and get into disagreements over the dogs training suddenly became a big deal. It sucks, because i did like him a lot, and as a person he's super awesome... but his dog changed my mind and i feel like a shallow jerk for making that the reason why I don't want to continue dating him."

bxabjm	2019-06-06 00:48:40		AITA for not going to a wedding “rehearsal dinner”?	"I caught a bit of shit for this. Good friends got married and it was a very non-traditional wedding. No ceremony, no dressing up, no family, just friends getting together in a private bar room. It was an out of town wedding for me and my SO and we were actually flying straight in from an international vacation. 

In the days leading up, there was a good amount of planning a casual dinner the night before. A place was decided. 

The day of the dinner, our flight is running late and when we landed my phone got a bunch of texts that was changing the dinner location due to some additional people that rendered the original spot a no go since they wouldn’t accommodate the new headcount. 

However, the new spot was a Korean bbq spot that didn’t offer any non-bbq options. My SO is a vegetarian (they know this). I declined due to the lack of non-meat options. I then caught shit because some other guests were vegetarian and they weren’t complaining. I explained that we had been traveling all day (left morning local time at the point of departure and arrived at night even after gaining hours) and hadn’t had much to eat all day and we would really like to get a meal. No hard feelings it didn’t work out. 

But some of my friends later told me I was being a diva asshole and I should’ve just sucked it up and gone to the dinner (which was JUST a dinner, to be clear. No wedding parties, wedding activities, etc).

&#x200B;

So I live with my roommate, who is one of my best friends from college. His house is quite old so it has 4 beds, but only 2 bathrooms. One is his room which is the master, and one in the main hallway which is the bathroom to be shared amongst the other rooms. However at the time its just us 2, and I pay rent to him.

&#x200B;

Once a week, he has a gathering amongst his friends, usually about 10 people or so. I've never had a problem with anything they did, even though some of his friends started eating my food in the fridge, didn't care that much, im cool with sharing. However because his bathroom is in his room, and he views the second bathroom as a guest bathroom, he told everyone to use the guest bathroom. The friends are not particularly dirty or anything, but I've seen a pee stain before on the seat, and I just don't want 10 people going in and out of my bathroom that I pay for every week, and then im left to clean it. I just find it close to disgusting thinking about it. I called him and mentioned it, and asked if it was possible if they could use his bathroom. He said no, and that its the guest bathroom. I said its not fair to me, that its his friends and I dont like sharing it with that many people. Then he basically left it at ""My house, my rules"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Logically I understand where he is coming from, but I really dislike having so many people use my bathroom, especially since its not my friends. Where do I stand on this?"	No A-holes here	0	0

It's not like I did it all really quick and didn't leave him time to contribute. It's due tomorrow and I just finished it because well it's due tomorrow. I'm worried he won't even look at it before we present and our presentation will go poorly.

"Before you read, just know that I’m pretty young, not a very good writer, and also this was written very hastily, so please don’t be too critical and I’d really appreciate it if you read it and give me your opinion.

TL:DR: My friends criticize me a LOT, but they have good intent. They want me to not be laughed at and stop embarrassing myself so much.


(I’m in 7th grade as of now and the school year is nearly over) 

I have two friends, I’ll call them Ava and Julia. The backstory behind us is very complicated so I’ll try to sum it up quickly. 


*backstory*

From 4th-6th grade me and Ava were super close and best friends, over 6th-7th grade summer we stopped talking and she got super close with Julia. I wanted to hate Ava so much, but I just couldn’t. I missed her so much.

Now I never had very high self esteem, but Ava moving onto Julia so fast after she left me completely destroyed me. It was like she didn’t even miss me. 

Anyways, I didn’t realize how close they were until I became close friends with Julia, at first there was some part of me wanting to make Ava feel the self hatred and blame I had felt, but over time I just wanted to get closer to Julia bc we had that friend chemistry. Eventually I realized I had accidentally *stole* Julia away from Ava, and I just want to make it clear that I had no idea that she was drifting away from Ava when this was happening. Me and her became best friends but now Julia is reconnecting with Ava and I think that Julia’s going to leave me like Ava did.


*aita story*

So, we’ve been all hanging out together, and they are constantly criticizing me. My clothes, the way I sit, what I eat, just every little thing. Now you’re probably thinking that they’re terrible people, but they’re really not, they are just protecting me from the people at our school saying those kinds of things about me behind my back. They just want to help, also I am a very jokey person so it’s just natural to have me as the butt of the joke, which they can take too far sometimes, but I don’t blame them for that.

The only thing is that they say it so cruelly that it just makes me not want to hang out and talk to them when they’re together because I just don’t feel like being put down. I really want to have fun with them, but because of this, I just can’t. And I know I should be grateful, but I just get down, and if I tell them about it, it’s not like they can just change themselves for a stupid thing.

I’ve been trying not to hang out with them too much because it just hurts so bad, seeing how close they’re getting. They bought matching chapsticks... and they opened them right in front of me... it really stung. I want to bring it up to Julia, but I’m pretty sure that she doesn’t like me anymore and just wants to hang out with Ava. 


At this point I’m just ranting so I’ll stop, but AITA for not appreciating their help?


Edit: idk if anyone will ever see this, but after reading all your kind replies, I’ve decided to talk to them about it, because they are sensible people and I believe everyone deserves a second chance. Thank you everyone.   :)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxa4hx	2019-06-06 00:29:18	hypemanabelincoln	AITA for ghosting this guy?	"  

I'm a female grad student. Spring Semester I had class with a guy from another school. He asked me to dinner a couple of times.

Another student in this class had taken several electives from my school. I'll refer to her as Crazy Pants (CP). CP came to class several times Fall Semester (one semester before this story) talking about this guy she's spending all this time with and how she can't wait for us to meet him. Whining that a guy she really likes doesn't feel the same about her. Going on about this T.A. she had who is so cool she wants to quit her full time job (at the Uni) so she can be in his program too.

If you're guessing all 3 of these scenarios described by CP were the same person, you're more ahead than I was in the Spring.

The guy from class shared lab space with CP. I'm guessing here, but as he talked about his weekend plans she starts inviting herself. She's showing up at the last minute anytime he asks me out to dinner and a movie (invited by him) because she stressed how badly she wanted to see Toy Story XXIII or whatever.

About the time I'm sick of weirdness and decide I'm done, he forgets his wallet after class and (without CP up his ass) I ask if he'd like to catch dinner again. Things get back to normal for a bit, then CP gets really aggressive with me. I put two and two together. CP quit her full time job at the Uni to follow this dude around. She wasn't accepted as a major in his school and received NO SCHOLARSHIP to pay for her studies and living expenses.

I don't want to be the 3rd wheel on what I assumed was \*my\* invitation. On the very last day of class he asks if I wanted dinner. CP is on the other side of the classroom and can't hear us. I say yes because I'm pathetic. We plan a time. A few minutes later he checks the movie times and asks if I can meet for dinner an hour earlier and see a movie. Like a dog whistle, CP makes her way back to our table because she wants to go too.

He turns to her and says WE are going to the movie. She begs, he gives in. Then he turns to me and confirms dinner. CP begs for dinner. He turns to her again and says ""WE are going to dinner. If you want to meet us at the theater you can."" I'm glad he put his foot down.

I ask if he would please talk to her and ask that she respect my privacy. He doesn't want to get involved and can't understand what happened. A couple of weeks later, he gets the great idea to come to my lab with CP and leaves her. I ask her to please respect my privacy, there is no reason for her to be here, to please leave me alone.

SHE LOSES HER SHIT

She's screaming I'M NOT STALKING YOU I'M CALLING THE POLICE. Which sounds like something a person would say when they were caught stalking you.

I block them both.

bxa3b7	2019-06-06 00:26:02	parquet7	AITA for not inviting my cousin to dinner?	"Recently my wife and I had a destination wedding - about 35 people. We kept it low key and wanted everyone to relax and enjoy. We planned the wedding for Saturday night and also hosted a brunch for all on Sunday morning. We didn't make special plans for dinners each night (other than the wedding), though on Thursday night we ended up having dinner with 3 cousins and a few friends -a group of about 10 of us (including our young kids -it's a 2nd marriage for both of us and we have 4 kids between us, including 2 with special needs -this becomes relevant later). Other guests made their own plans Thursday night and all seemed to be well.

By Friday night all of the guests had arrived. Some of our friends suggested going to dinner at 1 of the resort's 3 restaurants so we agreed to meet them there. We told some people we bumped into that day and invited them to come join us. Word got around and when we showed up at the restaurant some 20 of the 35 guests were there for dinner with us. I did not tell my cousins -not intentionally -just because we were only planning on seeing a handful of friends for dinner, and we had eaten dinner with them the night before. Also, my parents and brother were to arrive at the hotel around 5pm so I thought they would have a nice family dinner with them while my wife and I were eating with others in the group.

Unfortunately, my parents/brother got lost on the way from the airport and arrived late, so the ""family dinner"" with my cousins didn't happen. Instead, my cousins made their own plans for dinner at the same restaurant where we were meeting our friends. Notably, this ""friends"" gathering included my wife's parents because their plans changed last minute - but I should add that since my step-daughter has special needs, it's very helpful having them there to help out so we can spend time with our friends.

Upon arrival, one of my cousins made a bee line for me at the bar where I was greeting friends and said ""Thanks for inviting me to your dinner"" and then stormed off back to her table.

I was very upset by this and felt bad. I took my cousins aside to explain the circumstances -we didn't plan anything formally, it just all came together organically, I figured they would be glad to have a nice family dinner that night, we had had dinner with them (and not others) the very night before, etc. Two of them understood but the third said she didn't want to hear it and left. The next morning (the day of my wedding), I approached her and asked if we were cool (I hoped she spoke to her sisters and perhaps they explained things), but she said no and that she was upset with me.

The result was that my wife and I had to deal with those negative feelings the day of our wedding, which was a bummer.

Should I have made a point of inviting everyone to that Friday night dinner since we were hosting the weekend? Or was it ok to leave things casual and leave the formal plan for the Saturday night wedding and the Sunday brunch?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bxa0g0	2019-06-06 00:17:54		AITA for uninviting my cousin to a concert in which she invited herself?	"Thowaway account.

Last weekend I went to a concert with my girlfriend and some of my friends.

2 months prior, I (31 yrs old) uninvited my cousin (41 yrs old) and she did not take it well. 

&#x200B;

Backstory:

&#x200B;

My cousin bought tickets for me and my girlfriend (and 1 other) to the said concert. My cousin expected the 4 of us to go without asking any of us. She essentially invited herself to come with us. We didn't know how to handle this at the time (4 months before the event) so we just thanked her for the tickets and paid her back. 

&#x200B;

Shortly after that, my girlfriend went to a show with my cousin and 2 others. It was their girls' night. My cousin wasn't feeling very good that day and I told her to stay at home. She insisted. So I dropped all of them off at the concert. My cousin had one jello shot and she started to throw up. For the remainder of the night, my girlfriend was by her side near the bathroom. She was on a recreational substance herself but her mood got completely killed by babysitting my cousin the entire night. This honestly bothered me a lot. Again, I feel bad for my cousin but I care way more for my girlfriend. She was disappointed too but since she willingly chose to stay by my cousin's side, she couldn't complain. 

&#x200B;

So after that incident, I told my girlfriend I wanted to go to this concert with just her and some of my friends. She felt the same way. I felt bad ""uninviting"" my cousin but we wanted to enjoy ourselves. I did my best to word the text in the nicest way possible, but here is my original text: 

Me: ""Hey \_\_\_, for xxx show, I was talking to (my girlfriend) and I actually would like to go to this event with just my friends. I know you got us the tickets and I'm thankful for that, and we can have many other opportunities to hang out together, but for this event I hope you'll be okay with that. I wanted to tell you early enough and not spring it on you last minute."" 

Her: ""I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me. I'm not invited? And the tickets I bought are not needed?"" 

Me: ""We already bought the tickets from you, right? We just want to go with our separate group of friends.""

Her: ""Ok. So you're saying (4th friend) and I are on our own and won't be socializing with you guys then?""

Me: ""Yes or whoever else you'd like to go with.""

Her: ""Who else can I go with with only 2 tickets? The show is sold out."" 

Me: ""There are ways to get tickets I myself will need to find 3 others.""

Her: ""Ok. Good Luck.""

Me: ""Are you mad?""

Her: ""Not mad, disappointed yes. But not really surprised either.""

&#x200B;

She feels like the victim and that I was an asshole for uninviting her and for not ""tempering her expectations earlier."" She was very snarky in her responses, which I honestly felt was a little uncalled for. I just wanted a night to hang out with my girlfriend and my friends. I don't think we should have compromised our night merely out of pity for my cousin.

We've been together for 4 years now, I've met her family multiple times (they live about 9 hours away) and we all seem to get along fine. When Veronica first moved here she was living in a really bad place, so I offered to have her move in with me, so she did after 3 months dating. My folks liked her so much that when we went on a family vacation we took her with us to an all inclusive resort in Mexico, as well as multiple excursions. We paid for all of it, she or her family didn't pay a dime. It wasn't a big deal, we have money, we like her and her folks were super grateful for 1) ""Saving"" her from the shitty place she was living and 2) treating her well and taking her on a vacation, including her in the family. 

Now a few years later, out of no where my girlfriends sisters decide to plan a family vacation. All well and good, Veronica and I have been planning to do a vacation to Mexico for a while now so I figure we could all go together...only I find out they don't want me there. Veronica wants me there but they say its a ""family vacation."" In fact, when she said she wanted me to join they left her on read for half a day and seemed pretty annoyed by it. Obviously I'm upset. She will be spending most of my money (I make about double what she does), we've been planning to go just us for about a year and being so openly excluded despite what we have done for her is a massive slap in the face. I'm not saying that they owe us, not at all and I never thought about it as a repay me sort of deal, but I still feel its sorta unfair that she will be off enjoying a resort while I'm left at home.

She stared, made it clear she thought I was good looking (verbally told me and our whole class), and I was smitten. She had an on and off boyfriend so I never approached. I stopped seeing her from then and by senior year I told my friend to DM her and insert me into a convo. and my friend mentioned that I thought she was cute (all part of the plan), and she responded positively to that comment. Then I would DM her and rekindle things since we stopped seeing each other years ago.  (Didn’t just want to dm her out of no where since we stopped talking which is why my friend did what he did). Then I mentioned to her that I really liked her. She didn’t respond but I saw that she saw the message. I felt awkward and acted like my friend sent that to mess around but she said nothing. A day later she blocked me and my friend. Never saw her again and this was 3 years ago. Anyone have any insight as to what happened and if I did something wrong.	No A-holes here	1	0

I pulled out my wallet and found only a 5 and a 20 dollar bill in it. I gave him the $5, partly because it was the smaller one, and I stilled needed to get some groceries and lunch. When I gave him the $5, he must have noticed the $20, because he started cursing at me and tried to take the $20, even throwing racial slurs at me. He kept on making a fuss to the point where a few cops nearby noticed and approached us and I explained to him what happened, but when the homeless man explained it, he continued to throw the insults. He even used his status as a reason why I should give him a $20, and insults continued to fly after that. The cop eventually separated us and he brought me to the train station (it was a block away), just to be sure I would stop being harassed. Am I the asshole for not giving the $20 though? 

TLDR: I gave a homeless man a $5 bill instead of $20, and I ended up getting cursed at, and making me feel like a dick. AITA?"		1	0

When someone posts here, we're only getting one side of the story. There could be nuances and context that we aren't seeing because the post is from one perspective. I notice some commentors that act as though the OP is a Disney villain for being TA or acting as though the other party is the embodiment of evil. Though there are some cases where it is more obvious which party is in the moral right, real life is complicated and it's disappointing to see people rush to a hard-set judgment when morality is much more complicated than that. I understand the limitations of the sub; I'm just letdown by people who make assumptions thinking they know 100% what's going on. 

There are also the posters that get defensive when people disagree with them. I understand that being called TA might feel like an attack and some commentors can leave pretty bitter replies. However, it becomes obvious when someone is just seeking validation when they shut down ANY criticism whether or not it is valid. 

I also understand that posts can come across harsher than intended. Conveying meaning through text is difficult, especially with the terminology. Just because you're TA doesn't automatically mean you're a wicked monster- you're just in the wrong in this situation. 

Assuming the best and giving the benefit of the doubt can go a long way. No one should be TA until proven not TA."	META	0	0

She got suspend from school for juuling during hours. She is only 15 I’m worried she will develop a nicotine addiction since she is doing it at such a young even though she claims she only hits it with friends. Now she has recently acquired another one after my parents took her last. She just hasn’t learned her lesson. And I understand a lot of people her age do it and she does it to fit in.

My wife doesn't have a job so she stays at home all day. I am getting tired of seeing the house messy, dishes are never done and laundry just piles up in the laundry room. We've had a couple discussions in which she brings up that her ""depression"" which she has never had officially diagnosed stops her from cleaning. I more often then not do all the cleaning on my days off, but I generally pick up after myself, but I have started letting things pile up and not doing them myself so she is forced to do them.

AITA For thinking and wanting to saying that she doesn't have a job so her 'job' or way to earn her keep should be to clean the house and keep it nice.

&#x200B;

EDIT: From a few comments I can see I left out a key point that I skimmed over without thinking about it. We have seen mental healthcare providers and she has been diagnosed with severe Social Anxiety and some other personal things. Because of the social anxiety she finds it hard to get a job, and I completely respect that and would never try and force her to. The issue arises in that none of her doctors can see that she is depressed, she exhibits no symptoms of it or displays any of the traits associated with it. That is why I put it in quotation, simply because it is an unconfirmed self diagnosis. I understand that it can be extremely difficult to catch it, but it does seem like she's using it as an excuse to not have to do something."	No A-holes here	0	0
bx9rn1	2019-06-05 23:53:48	cowsandlicorice	WIBTA if I asked a very pregnant, or new mother, to skip over a bachelorette party?	"I’m a bridesmaid planning my good friend’s bachelorette party. Everyone she wants to invite lives in different cities and is busy with their lives, so we planned bachelorette weekend a year in advance. Since then, most of us have something or another for the rest of the year planned, except for times when flights would be expensive or weather in brides area anyways. 


Her MOH is currently pregnant and will be either at 41 weeks or have given birth  by bachelorette weekend. She’s expressed that she’d still come out though, baby in arms if need be. 

I am worried that having MOH there would not let the bride have the fun carefree night she wants, especially with a newborn but maybe if shes super pregnant too, and the bride has expressed before that the bachelorette is totally in my hands because she’s busy with wedding planning and whatnot. 

The bachelorette will definitely include going out and drinking and dancing, and it will probably be a wild night. The MOH would still be invited to dinner beforehand and brunch the morning after, but not the actual partying. 

WIBTA if I asked MOH to just sit it out?


Edit: she will bring the baby if he’s born by then. She’s asked me to make sure the places we go are okay with newborns being there. Obviously I don’t know how long she’d stay or anything but I’m taking her for her word when she says it.


Edit 2: I've decided to just plan the event as it was going to be but ask the bride to make sure that the MoH is comfortable with attending. I'll try to find baby-friendly restaurants but as some people have stated, the baby will be so young that maybe it won't be safe to bring the baby out in the first place? Regardless, the mother can make that decision. The responses were pretty split here but I think this is a good compromise, so thank you everyone!"	No A-holes here	0	0

Amy says how perfect her boyfriend is and how amazing and incredible he is. 

As soon as I met Sebastian, I knew there was something wrong with him. He seemed like a bad dude under a nice guy disguise. I went along with what Amy said about how he’s so amazing. I didn’t wanna judge because it’s not my relationship and I really don’t know him. 

A week-ish later, Sebastian texts Amy and says, “Hey baby. I have some family issues going on I’ll be gone for a few days.” Immediately, I felt like something was up. I told Amy to be cautious. It’s been four weeks and Sebastian has not come back. 

Amy and I did some digging and we found an ex-girlfriend of Sebastian’s. It turns out, his ex was ghosted the exact. same. way. I’ve been comforting Amy for the past week or two, but recently I got fed up with how she thinks he’s so perfect. I tried to be nice about it when she asked what I think. I said “Well, I dont know just from the past, it seems like he’s not coming back. I’m sorry but I think you need to start moving on.” Amy proceeds to yell at me and call me

I left my dogs with my in laws to look after them whilst travelling for the night (a pair of 3 month old collie pups), they phoned me about 45 miles into my trip to tell me the dog was whimpering and crying and that we might need a vet, this set my partner off as she is very emotional so we made arrangements and took the dog to the vet (around 9:30pm) were there for a couple hours before the diagnoses is that the dog needs to be kept in for a few days, has a broken leg and needs surgery and we forked out the bill for it and they said they would call in the morning, it's now 11:30ish when I get home.

After sitting talking to a friend for about an hour I just couldn't shake the nausiating feeling and headed back to my in laws place when my parents confronted me about not being home to help them with odd jobs (this includes house cleaning, general caretaking and doing odd jobs around the house) I told them both that my partner was hysterical and I didn't like the idea of her being alone with her parents because they seem to think they are responsible for the accident which I personally think is bs since they are puppies and accidents happen, anyway,

I set off about 12:30am and I get a slew of angry text messages from my parents for blowing them off and how I need to be more considerate, well after much back and forth I decided to send them the money I would have otherwise made from helping out and said I was sorry but my ""priorities"" were well in order here holding down the fort in case the vet calls and we need to head out late at night for whatever reason.

I didnt wanna look like a punk in front of the girl I like or the rest of my coworkers, so I was like ""bring her idgaf"" Truth is I can't fight at all and she would probably beat my ass.

bx9nhr	2019-06-05 23:42:23	dogsrcute_	AITA for not being cool with my SO’s weed cultivation hobby?	"Backstory: We’ve been together for 3 years. In the beginning of our relationship, we talked about past failed relationships. I mentioned how my prior SO had a cultivation hobby and it wasn’t something I was too comfortable with. My current SO understood and it wasn’t something to be concerned about because my SO worked in the government and my SO would absolutely not risk doing that. 

Now my SO has a new job. And they mentioned a few months ago that they were thinking about growing cannabis. I told them, again, I’m not comfortable with it and that it’s a dealbreaker for me. 

They started the hobby because they really wanted to. That’s cool - everyone is an individual and can make their own decisions. I figured I’d let them ride it out and get it out of their system. I mentioned that our progress as a couple would be impacted by this - I absolutely will not move into an apartment with illegal plants. Again, a deal breaker. It was noted and not discussed. 

Now my SO is growing a second plant. 

I’m a little upset. I know each person has the right to do as they wish; but after 3 years together I’d hope to have some sort of mutual respect on this front. It’s something I’m extremely uncomfortable with and it’s frustrating to deal with it on such a frequent basis. 

SO claims to never have heard that it’s a dealbreaker for me. That’s okay - maybe they didn’t. In any case, I made it clear that growing illegal weed is not something I’m cool with and it’s absolutely a dealbreaker from this point forward with me. I cannot see a future with this in between us and it’s caused a lot very unfortunate fights between us. 

SO is making me feel like a total dick for not being cool with this. I’m “ridiculous”. I’m “crazy”. I should just “ask my friends what they think”. I should “ask reddit” (lol). 

In any case, curious to hear what you fine minds think.

Edit: For clarification, I am not opposed to cannabis as a concept. It’s just the actual growing of it that’s the difficult situation here."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I moved back to my home state and we didn't talk too often apart from sending each other snaps or playing video games online sometimes if we were both on.

So I (20 F) have recently moved back home because I am moving from my apartment to a house and unfortunately there’s about a week and half period in between when I had to move out of my apartment and move into my new place. 

Now to the actual incident, day 3 of being home 
I was making dinner for my parents tonight as they aren’t the biggest fan of cooking and my sister was helping me. Now I don’t mind cooking as I was off from work today and find cooking calming, however my sister is rather clueless, book-smart, but completely clueless in regards to basic things, so I was getting a little frustrated, admittedly and was a bit of an asshole. She spent too much money on the shrimp and got the wrong size, did not pick up all the ingredients so I had to run out and get more, and added too much water to the rice. The breaking point for me was when she messed up the sauce and made it extremely watery when it was supposed to be stickier . So I was a little annoyed and when my family came down to eat my mom told me to chill out and shut up. I agreed and spooned rice into a bowl and then used the same spoon for the dish. My brother gets angry and says I messed up the rice by using the same spoon. I, already in a bad mood, rolled my eyes to which my mom yelled at both of us to knock it off. I got mad and said I didn’t do anything and said I can’t wait for my house to be ready to which she replied that no one else wants me in this house anyway. I said okay and left to eat alone on the porch, admittedly and not proudly beginning to cry and I know my mom would get angry at me for that. 

Later that night she called me into her room to ask why I could not at least try to enjoy my time here. I told her that I was trying to be helpful and was just getting annoyed earlier at everyone’s comments and mistakes. She then asked me why I couldn’t be a more grateful daughter to which I responded with “like you couldn’t have done better as a mother?” to which she responded with by beginning to yell and ask me how. 

Now, this is the part where things get really bad if you can’t tell. I told her about when I was younger and she told my siblings when I had
been diagnosed with depression and bpd and constantly talking about my siblings and me behind our backs to each other, such as my sisters issues with cocaine. Without letting her talk I also told her about the time she handed me a gun, when I was 12, and she told me to shoot her during one of her episodes. Finally, me crying, talked about the time she caught me throwing up in high school and yelled at me for wasting food and if I wanted to lose weight to do go to the gym and eat less (I was bulimic).

After exploding, I went back downstairs to where my dad soon followed, yelling at me
for being so mean to my mom. I apologized to him but not to her yet."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I've been a fan of Japanese wrestling since I was a youngster. I like to collect memorabilia and have been doing so since then, so I have quite a large collection. It consists of a full size shelf of magazines, some masks, and figures. I am very proud of my collection.

As for the relationship, we had been together for 2 years. At first she thought of it as silly but didn't seem to judge me for it, I'm like whatever, if she thinks I'm a loser for it she wouldn't be with me in the first place. But then after about a year, at which point we are living together in my apartment, she starts saying I should get rid of my stuff or put it away (I keep it in my living room). I tell her no thanks whenever she tries to bring it up. Her reasoning is that when her friends and family come over it's 'embarrassing' for her. One day she just says out right I need to drop this hobby as a whole, and it's either that or the relationship is over. Now I'm realising how controlling this is and starting to see her misandry, so I ended things with her. I'm not sure if she was bluffing or what because she trying to contact me since then about meeting up to talk about it and how we can 'work something out'.

I don't know, my friends who are wrestling fans say I did the right thing. Some other friends who are not fans say I did the right thing. Her family and friends are saying that I am being immature and shouldn't be throwing away the relationship over something 'childish'"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bx9iel	2019-06-05 23:28:28		AITA for poking fun at my roommate for playing in a church band?	"So right now (I [26M] tend to move a lot), I'm living with a buddy (28M) who I've played in bands with in the past. He was living with another one of his friends, a girl (28F) (platonic though) who hes played with in bands before. We've all gotten along fine and me and her became friends too, and have gone to a lot of shows together. We most have played punk and indie rock music.

For awhile she said she wasn't in any bands at the moment, but then mentioned going to practices and was frequently gone on Sunday evenings. I asked her about it out of curiosity, and she told me that she's not in any bands playing shows at the moment but she plays at her church. She said if I ever wanted to come see it that was fine but begged me to not tell anyone outside of church or our mutual roommate. I thought that was silly seeing as how many people hide their atheism and I'm not open to my entire family about how I'm an atheist and lack of religion, the fact that she was hiding hers with how Christian dominated our culture is but I've respected her wishes. She also mentioned she got paid a small stipend so I assumed she was just doing it as easy gigs for the money...but later talking to her she admitted to me she not only plays keyboard and sings there but has actually preached a few times...so she's actually doing it because she believes it. Which I also found weird because she's not ""church looking"" at all (has a whole sleeve of tattoos and a full back piece) and is quite progressive, and has gay and even sex worker friends, actually even more than me since I love guns and she hates them and I promised her to never show her the guns I have. She also talks a lot about having sex with her exes (single now.)

So I've ribbed her a bit about it, nothing harsh but kind of joked about how she's singing to an invisible man or worshipping a zombie on Easter. I think its ridiculous she's hiding this when it actually way elevates her in most people's opinion over a godless heathen like me and our other roommate. She seems to be getting kind of irritated about that and kind of angrily told me ""none of your business"" when I asked her why she had so much premarital sex with her exes if she actually believes in this even though she's the one at the time who brought up having sex. I still think she's a cool person but I can't wrap my mind over how she's embarrassed about being part of our mainstream culture and think thus it's ok to do some light ribbing (it's not she's in an oppressed minority group), plus I'm respecting her wishes for privacy.

"So, a little over a month ago, my husband and I started noticing a small SUV-type vehicle constantly parking near our home. Its not directly in front of our driveway... from where the curb of the driveway is to where he usually parks you could probably fit another big vehicle in between. Its public parking, he's not in our way....but there is just something that is odd. He parks there for hours and I've never seen him get out or go to any of the houses. When I drive past the car as I am leaving for/arriving from work, or come back from running errands, I see that he is always in there. He often moves across the street and stays there another while before coming back. If I had to quantify the amount of time he is parked close by when I am around to notice I'd say like 75%... And he is ALWAYS in his car. 

Idk if he is homeless and sleeping there (I've seen him at basically all times of day) and I dont want to be an asshole but it kinda creeps me out that I walk to my garden and he is there, I go to work, come back and he is there.  I've thought about calling the non-emergency number for my city so they can go investigate but idk if I should or if I should just let him be.

There is a very busy street, Central Ave, one street over, but really no one on the street I was on, 1st Ave. I heard someone behind me and glanced and saw a kid maybe 18 years old who was walking roughly three yards behind me and looked to be coming home from school or something.

I continued walking when about 15 seconds later he said, “excuse me, can I ask you a question?”. I really didn’t want to have a conversation so I panicked and sprinted as quickly as I could into a parking lot towards Central Ave. Right when I started running I looked back to ensure I wasn’t being followed and saw that the kid put his hands up in a non-threatening way with a look of pure hurt on his face, then said, “woah, I’m not going to…” as I was running off but I was too far away to hear anything after that and ran all the way to Central Ave.

Now, I’m an easily kidnappable 110lb (\~50kg) young female, but to be honest I wasn’t afraid for my safety at any time -- I just didn’t want to talk to a stranger. AITA for rejecting and hurting a very likely well-intentioned kid? I’ve read social rejection causes anger, anxiety, depressions, etc… and don't want to be the cause of that but also don't want to talk to random people on the street..."	Asshole	0	0

bx9fgi	2019-06-05 23:20:30		AITA for ruining my “friend’s” fun?	"So this happened between us several years ago, and no longer occurs. The reason I’m asking for judgment is because anytime it’s brought up, we end up in a fight and consider the other person the asshole. 

So a few years ago when I was in high school one of my best friends I had known for years prior began to (what I consider) bully me pretty severely. I could write essays about the specific things said but it basically boiled down to him taking pictures of me during school without my knowledge, sending them to my friends and I, and then either making fun of how I look or something I do. There were several times where he would make up something embarrassing I do, which we both know I didn’t, and then harass me about it with the pictures. 

This ruined my self confidence and went on for over a year and we had many fights about how horrible it made me feel. His argument always ended up being, that I was ruining his fun over some little pictures. And that if all I have to do is feel bad for a little while to make my friends happier, I should be glad to do it. To me this sounds sociopathic and beyond delusional, to him I’m being stuck up and can’t laugh at myself. It all ended once someone else decided to do it as well, and he decided this person was being way too mean to me and basically kicked him out of the friend group. Whenever I say that was hypocritical he tells me this guy was being mean to put me  down, while he was just joking around with a friend. 

He hasn’t done this in years, knows pictures of myself really bother me, and basically walks on eggshells every time the topic is brought up. Yet every time we do bring it up, it always ends in him thinking I’m an asshole for holding jokes from years ago against him, and making them seem much worse than they really were. Am I really just being an overreacting asshole?

Tdlr: Years ago a friend took off guard pictures of me and would send them to myself and other friends putting me down. No matter how many times I told him how much it bothered me he didn’t care. Now whenever it’s brought up he thinks I’m an asshole for making a bigger deal out of how things really were."		1	0
bx9ekj	2019-06-05 23:18:08		AITA for poking fun at my roommate for p6in a church band	"(Throwaway, she knows my main account) So right now (I [26M] tend to move a lot), I'm living with a buddy (28M) who I've played in bands with in the past. He was living with another one of his friends, a girl (28F) (platonic though) who hes played with in bands before. We've all gotten along fine and me and her became friends too, and have gone to a lot of shows together. We most have played punk and indie rock music.

For awhile she said she wasn't in any bands at the moment, but then mentioned going to practices and was frequently gone on Sunday evenings. I asked her about it out of curiosity, and she told me that she's not in any bands playing shows at the moment but she plays at her church. She said if I ever wanted to come see it that was fine but begged me to not tell anyone outside of church or our mutual roommate. I thought that was silly seeing as how many people hide their atheism and I'm not open to my entire family about how I'm an atheist and lack of religion, the fact that she was hiding hers with how Christian dominated our culture is but I've respected her wishes. She also mentioned she got paid a small stipend so I assumed she was just doing it as easy gigs for the money...but later talking to her she admitted to me she not only plays keyboard and sings there but has actually preached a few times...so she's actually doing it because she believes it. Which I also found weird because she's not ""church looking"" at all (has a whole sleeve of tattoos and a full back piece) and is quite progressive, and has gay and even sex worker friends, actually even more than me since I love guns and she hates them and I promised her to never show her the guns I have. She also talks a lot about having sex with her exes (single now.)

So I've ribbed her a bit about it, nothing harsh but kind of joked about how she's singing to an invisible man or worshipping a zombie on Easter. I think its ridiculous she's hiding this when it actually way elevates her in most people's opinion over a godless heathen like me and our other roommate. She seems to be getting kind of irritated about that and kind of angrily told me ""none of your business"" when I asked her why she had so much premarital sex with her exes if she actually believes in this even though she's the one at the time who brought up having sex. I still think she's a cool person but I can't wrap my mind over how she's embarrassed about being part of our mainstream culture and think thus it's ok to do some light ribbing (it's not she's in an oppressed minority group), plus I'm respecting her wishes for privacy.

So is she being oversensitive or am I being a dick?"		1	0
bx9df1	2019-06-05 23:15:12	estrangedson9	WIBTA if I didn’t speak to my dad and my grandfathers funeral?	"Here’s some background information. My parents were pretty young when I was born. Married at 17 and 20, I was born 2 years later, and they subsequently divorced when I was a year old. My parents absolutely hate each other. As far back as I can remember there would never be a time that they spoke that wouldn’t result In an all out argument, and it was mostly my dad. He would call my mom names and scream at her at the top of his lungs right in front of me or I would watch it unfold over the phone. This was all difficult for me to handle as a young kid and I remember just going to my room and trying to block/wait it out. He would talk bad about my mom to me and that always made me uncomfortable. As I grew older I became more aware of my dads drug and alcohol abuse. He was never physical with me but there was verbal abuse. He would drink and go off the rails about my mom and my step dad (who is a fantastic man and I consider him my father). On two occasions he told me before I was the age of 10 “if you like him so much than he can be your dad”. That’s a very hurtful thing for a 10 year old to hear. He cared very much about how other perceived him and I was heavy into sports so If I was playing poorly he would get pissed because other kids looked better on the field. He would give me dirty looks from the sideline, yell at my coaches if they subbed me out. When I was a sophomore in high school he was intentionally talking shit about my two coaches in front of my mom who was sitting with one of my coaches wives, just to be an asshole. This resulted in my coach confronting him and a screaming match in front of everyone. I was devastated. Things like this happened pretty consistently throughout my life up through high school. 

Fast forward to when I was 18. I had no clue what I wanted to do and was considering joining the army. I spoke to my dad about this and he went off saying things like “do you want to get killed?” “Do you want to shit in buckets in the desert? Because that’s what your going to do”. Things of that nature. But than the breaking point came when he said “you’re fucked up in the head if you want to go to war. And if you don’t value your life or care about your family than you don’t need to speak to me”. I responded to him with “if that’s what you want than fine”. It’s been 10 years since that day and I have spoken to him 1 time 4 years ago at the funeral of distant relative. 

Fast forward to today, my grandfather (my dads dad) is not doing so good. He’s old and sick and he has less than a year left. When this day comes I know I won’t want speak to him but I know that it would hurt my grandmother, whom I love very much, on a day that will already be a nightmare for her. I don’t want to cause any unnecessary drama. WIBTA if I ignored his advances at my grandfathers funeral? Or should I suck it up for the sake of my grandmother and other relatives?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

She turned it on out of nowhere for me staying up late when I have nothing else to do. No job, no school. No nothing. I do chores sometimes when I can, it only takes a minute. But my dad heard us talking, woke up started yelling at me, ""yolked me up"" by the hair and smacked me in the face and pushed me up to my room. Then he followed me upstairs, told me ""he was sick of my PS4 shit"" and yanked me PS4 so hard out of it's place that my piece just ripped out and my headset was on it too and he dropped it on the floor and the earmuff broke partly. Then he walked into the kitchen and straight dumped it in the garbage. It didn't get cushioned by the garbage because there was none and my PS4 got cracked on the side of it and I took it back upstairs and tried to be by myself, angry as hell and he walked back upstairs and grabbed it and tried to take it outside and destroy it but I argued him down so he put it away somewhere. But I took the family phone and snapped it in half.

bx99pc	2019-06-05 23:05:20	repairasaurus	WIBTA if I tell my ex's boyfriend that she came onto me multiple times?	"I dated a girl for years. It ended badly for multiple reasons but we continued to be on again and off again for a few years following. I finally decided I was tired of being used emotionally and financially and cut all ties. I blocked her number and all social media. I spent 6 months working on myself and finally was on the up. She got in contact with my family and begged them to get me to speak with her. We ended up speaking, going out to dinner, and had a few drinks. She spent the entire night telling me exactly what I wanted to hear, came onto me a few different times, and ended it with how happy she was she that were talking again. It was honestly one of the better nights I've had in a long time because of everything she said. The following week we got to the meat and bones via texting and unsurprisingly she still wanted me to just be there when she needed and turned into a huge asshole when I repeated what she said the night we hung out. We agreed to take it slow instead of jumping into things. A few days later I found out she's back with her ex that she dated during the 6 months I didn't speak with her. I text her to get the story from her. She hasn't responded, and refuses to explain herself. I obviously know that I'm better off without her and plan on getting back on my feet the way I did before. But I really want to message her bf explaining all the terrible things she said about him, how she explained they'd broken up because she missed me, and let him know she came onto me multiple times. Am I the asshole for wanting to expose her? It obviously doesn't really benefit me directly.

Edit 1:
So to clear up the timeline somewhat. I hadn't spoken with said EX in over 6 months since she used me and ghosted me at Christmas. So I'm taking some of this as guesswork from what I've gathered. It appears they either broke up or decided to have a break about 3 weeks before she contacted me. She arranged somewhere to meet, wanted to go to drinks afterward, and came onto me multiple times. Kissing me and eventually fooling around in the car. All 100% initiated by her. So either way, it doesn't appear they were together officially and she went out of her way to get to me.

I guess the real question that irks me, is should I do it or not? I really don't think I'll be an asshole for telling her current boyfriend the truth about what she did. She did it, it's her actions and choices. If I tell him, it honestly won't be something to help him out even if it indirectly does. It would purely be to hurt her. Whenever we talked that night, she made it a point to apologize for past mistakes, explain that she knows what she's going to have to do to make it work with me, said she loved me, made future plans, the whole 9 yards. She unwinded years of pain and 6 straight months of uninterrupted focus in a single night. Then ghosted me for no reason other than she didn't want to be accountable. If I tell him, it will be because she made it a point to disregard my feelings and drop a bomb on me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx98r9	2019-06-05 23:02:50	WorriedMom003	WIBTA for cutting off sick daughter?	"This is my first post here so I hope I’m doing it right.

My daughter (25F) has been struggling with anorexia, anxiety, and depression for several years now. She’s been through multiple therapists, hospital stays, and treatment facilities. She has a cycle where she’ll go to treatment, do well for a few months afterward, and then relapse, ending up back in treatment. 

Her illnesses have left her behind her peers when it comes to hitting milestones: she hasn’t graduated college yet since she keeps needing to take semesters off for treatment, and when she’s able, she works a part-time minimum wage retail job. She’s still depends on us financially for the most part because she obviously does not earn much at her current job. She’s still on our insurance, but it doesn’t cover much, if anything, when it comes to the care she needs, so my husband and I end up footing the bill for her appointments, treatment stays, etc.

It’s been years of dealing with this, and at this point, my entire family is exhausted. My daughter has expressed guilt for costing us so much money, and every time she swears that this will be her last time going away for help, but a couple months pass and we end up right back where we started. She promises that she’s trying, but I’m starting to doubt that. If she were, obviously something would have clicked or changed by now.

My other children have had to have their lives be put on the back burner because my eldest daughter has taken priority with her issues, and I don’t feel like it’s fair to them. At this point, I wonder if it’s time to step back and just let my daughter figure this out for herself.

WIBTA if I stopped financially supporting my daughter until she proves that she can stay in solid recovery for a significant amount of time? I don’t want my daughter to die, but at this point, I feel like there’s nothing I can do to help her anymore. I’m at the end of my rope.

EDIT: She has a treatment team consisting of a therapist, dietitian, psychiatrist, and primary care physician that she sees weekly/bi-weekly. That just doesn’t seem to be enough for her for long periods of time.

EDIT 2: We’ve looked into getting her on Medicaid, yet none of her providers and practically zero treatment facilities take it, so even if she had it, it wouldn’t be of any use. I did not consider having her apply for disability. I’ll bring that up to her."	Asshole	0	0

&#x200B;

I'm visiting a friend soon.  She lives far from me, so I don't see her but once a year.  She is also very rich.  Like, never has to work a day in her life type of rich.  I, on the other hand, have to work very hard and plan for every purchase I make.  Tattoos are one of those purchases I have to save up for, big time.  It's a good thing, though, because it gives me time to make sure I truly want it.

&#x200B;

My friend has a great tattoo artist out there that she's gotten three tattoos from in the past year.  I want work done from the artist while I'm out there, and my friend suggested we book appointments one after the other.  Lately I've been a tad touchy about money because I've gotten some medical debt that's kept me from having more spending money.  It's hard, so I asked her if talking about money between us could be a hard boundary.  She is very caring, and agreed not to talk about big purchases and vacations.  This has, so far, worked well for us.  

&#x200B;

Thing is, I don't want to spend my time with her being reminded that she can just go get a tattoo whenever she wants one because she can afford it.  I'd rather us do other things together, like our shared hobby or even watch tv together like we used to.  We have gotten tattoos with one another before (not matching), but it was a long time ago and I'm not sure why I'm more touchy about my financial situation now.  Jealousy is a hell of a drug, I guess.

&#x200B;

So, WIBTA if I asked her kindly to not book a tattoo appointment while I'm there since she can get one when I leave?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: friend has more money than me, and it makes me feel kind of down about my own situation, so we don't talk about finances.

bx92x1	2019-06-05 22:47:23	lalaland200	AITA For letting my dogs on the couch at an Airbnb and WIBTA for leaving a bad review?	"Hi everyone, I stayed at an Airbnb that is pet friendly (dog bowls included) but strictly has a no pets on the couch rule advertised. They say they will charge $60 per hour for deep cleaning if they find it's been broken. Here is my argument, the living room is maybe 300 square feet and the couch is a HUGE sectionional. There is a small piece of living room in front of the couch filled with a huge coffee table. There is barely any room in the apartment besides the couch. It is not practical to keep two dogs off the couch the entire trip, especially when we are out of the unit as there is almost nowhere else to go. 

The sectional is so big I can't even cover it all with a blanket. I covered two sections with a blanket the best I could. Anyway, the place was in perfect condition besides some dog hair on the couch which I vacuumed before leaving. After the trip, the host says they found dog hair on the couch and will charge for deep cleaning. I tell them it's not a fair rule because in a small apartment it's impossible to keep two dogs off the couch.  They need a smaller couch so there is room for dogs or a cover that can be used. 

I agreed to the rule as stated and knew about it in advance, but I did not know the size of the sectional. I literally don't know how I could keep both dogs off the couch when I left the apartment. They would both basically have to stay in the same spot on the ground by the entrance and not move. I tried my best to cover it and when I was home I wouldn't let them stay on it, but of course they would try to jump up sometimes. 

Please note there was NO damage or issue, only dog hairs which I had already vacuumed. Am I the asshole for letting them on the couch and would I be the asshole for leaving a bad review?"	Asshole	0	0

He has some behavioural  issues and gets extremely hyper and it can translate to outright aggression. I always keep an eye on him because quite frankly I don’t trust him around my 4 year old daughter.  

We had a family BBQ and my daughter was following him around, as she does, and while a couple of cousins were there that are boys at age 8 and 10 I didn’t like that my nephew was choosing to only play with my daughter. They would match his strength and energy a lot more than she would, but I can’t exactly tell them not to play with each other. Anyway, at one point I turned around and he shoved her from behind pretty hard and she fell down to her knees and started crying. He was red in the face, and biting his lip and honestly it scared me. I marched over to them and said “don’t you EVER push her like that again. You don’t do that to anyone and especially not my daughter” I raised my voice which is a regrettable but seeing my daughter go down so hard and so predictably just flipped a switch in me. 

My sister in law runs over and grabs my nephew (her son) and gets very mad at me and tells me he can’t help it and how dare I raise my voice. She said he plays fine and I’m overreacting and my daughter will be fine, as “kids play rough all the time!”. Later on when the kids aren’t around she mentions it again and says raising my voice would have really upset her boy and I say well maybe she should tell him that pushing and shoving isn’t ok - especially when they’re little, it’s a life lesson. Anyway, they leave and I’m the asshole apparently. She said she wants an apology and I probably will to save any drama but right now I really don’t want to."	Not the A-hole	1	0
bx91vd	2019-06-05 22:44:52		AITA for feeling angry my roommates got a new puppy?	"I'm going to start by saying if this falls outside of the arbitration guidelines of the forum, then I humbly accept removal.

One year ago I moved into a house owned by a family member and significant other. I brought with me my SO, our toddler, and a dog. It was explained then that they acticipated also getting a dog of their own for the home. We obliged because the more the merrier, and it's not our home to even have a say in the matter. We stay here with limited rent and under the impression we will eventually be moving out. It's been a hard year financially: starting over in a new state and setting up jobs/daycare/our own home has proved time consuming. I admit we were under prepared. I'm certain we have started to outstay our welcome after almost a years time.

Well 2 months ago our dog was diagnosed with canine lymphoma. We didn't go the route of chemo, who can with a fixed budget? Steriods kept her going about 6-8 more weeks. 2 days ago we took her to be put down. It was rough on us and explaining it to our child is even harder.

While this was occuring, my roommate/family member began the process of obtaining their puppy. Timing was terrible. The day immediately after we put our dog down, they were approved for adoption and got their dog. Now my SO is extremely sour on the matter, and I am also just a tad PO'd that they weren't a bit more empathetic to our loss. I've done my best to engage the new dog, explain to our little one the situation, and be happy for their new addition. Being ""dog people"", it's hard not to be.

Are we reading too much into this? Are we not being as forgiving because we have become so comfortable in their home? Is this more than a perceived slight (a little shortsighted of our feelings or worse) or are we being hypersensitive?

I feel terrible because I want to understand: why was my equally clean dog not allowed on the couch but the new puppy is? Why couldn't we have a week or two to properly grieve? Why does it seem acceptable to allow the puppy use our lost dog's things?

I love my family, and I love dogs, yet at the moment my love has turned into aggravation and the feeling of being ""self centered"" while also coping with this loss by privately accusing people I love of the same crappy flaw. On one hand, it's not my home and we REALLY should be out of here by now, and on the other if you respect the attachment of a dog they should understand our feeling upset? AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

"My sister is in her last year of high school and she wants to enter an Arts and Design specialty in her college of choice, but she needs to achieve a certain grade in order to be eligible for acceptance. I went to the college to ask for this certain grade and it turned out to be achievable. The problem is, my sister has never really tried anything seriously regarding her studies in the past, she used to fail one or more subjects each year. This is the first year where she is putting in effort in her studies and has actually managed to more or less finish studying the whole curriculum before going to the exam (something she never done before). 


However, My sister is the type of person that if she has one page left in the book and a month to finish this page, she will procrastinate till the end of the month and then end up not being able to finish it. Acting on my knowledge of her behaviour (which is very similar to me actually, i just know how to control this behaviour and keep it in check) i told her a higher cut-off grade for her specialty and since then, she has been working at double the effort. The exams are next week though and she's starting to doubt she'll ever do good, seeing that she regularly did bad at previous years. She thinks this year will just be more of the same and just today she broke down crying to my mom telling her about how she didn't expect the needed grade to be this high, my mother was weirded out by this because she knows this specialty is relatively easy to get into. Mom came to talk to me about this and i told her the whole thing.

Upon learning about my plan and seeing that i've took it upon myself to go through with it without consulting her first, she lost her mind at me, telling me i made a grave mistake and telling me to go tell her the truth. But i think that even if she thinks what i did was wrong, telling my sister the truth in this tense week will just make her relax more than usual and it's guaranteed she won't study a single word this week before the exam. 

Am i the asshole for coming up with this plan and acting on it behind my parent's back? I did what i wished people did for me, to push me further. My parents are the type of people that accept mistakes with an open heart, but they never really teach how you to improve yourself and not repeat those mistakes, they're very content with mediocrity. I've had to do this for myself all throughout medschool and i'm just trying to improve my  sister in return because God knows my parents won't be able to do that.

bx8zop	2019-06-05 22:39:30	jazhola21	AITA for leaving my family to spend a gap year in South America?	"My family is complicated. My father walked out when I was eight years old and I have been living in my grandparent's house with my mother and my sister since then. I'm currently a senior in high school. In going through the application process for college, I was accepted into my dream school on the condition that I join the class of 2024, not 2023, and not attend any other institution throughout the year. I began looking for gap year programs and applied to one that would have me spend eight months in South America next year. The organization is highly regarded and accredited, and offers the kids who participate in it a wonderful experience. I'm also partially bilingual and want to be fluent in Spanish badly, so this seemed like an incredible opportunity. After going through the application and interview process, I was selected and offered a significant financial aid package to make the trip. I was absolutely elated. My mother was not. The town we moved to after my father left has, in many ways, treated our family very poorly. It was decided that after I graduate, we would move so that my younger sister would get the chance to go to high school in a place better suited for her. We've now made the steps necessary to complete this move and will be doing so over the summer. I will be around while we are moving and will be doing most of the work for it.

&#x200B;

Recently my mother has been furious at me. She's said that I'm abandoning our family and leaving her and my sister. Despite the fact that I have done everything that's been asked of me in this situation, and more, she continues to guilt me and guilt me to the point of making me really down a lot of the time. My room is right next to her room and her door is closed all of the time. When she opens it to leave and come back, she makes sure to slam it as loud as she can to express her anger. We have always had a great relationship. I've considered myself to be a momma's boy my entire life and have looked to my mother oftentimes as my closest friend and greatest advocate. However, in our last exchange where I brought her the groceries, she asked me to buy when picking up my sister from school, she began saying the same mean-spirited things about me leaving. Throughout the past nine years since my father left, the responsibility of taking care of my family has oftentimes laid on my shoulders. However, my mother made sure to point out at the end of our most recent exchange that, ""We don't need you. We'll be okay without you.""

&#x200B;

I've worked so hard, for so long, because I believed that it would all pay off in the end. Objectively it has! I'm going to the school I've always wanted to go to, and I now have this incredible opportunity to spend eight months expanding my worldview, learning about different cultures, and have a life-changing experience. I love my family more than anything on this earth. By trying to live my own life and take control of my future, am I being an asshole for leaving them behind?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I had told RH multiple times, including the delivery people over the phone, they needed to come into the loading dock and deliver through the service elevators because I live in a high rise building.

Our concierge staff had to improvise with the other building staff (already waiting at the loading dock) to get one of the residents’ elevator quickly padded to take the item up to my unit. 

I was super pissed about the delivery team’s incompetence because they failed to follow simple instructions. After they put the furniture on my balcony and took away the packaging, I signed the papers and sent them on their way. They waited like I was going to give them a tip, but I wasn’t. It was a few awkward seconds. While they were waiting for the elevator, I could hear they weren’t happy about not getting a tip because I kept my door open to make sure they got in the elevator.

My mother dated a man in our hometown, became pregnant with me within a year. Turned out he was bipolar, committed felony after felony from drugs, abuse, theft (auto and identity) you name it he’s likely done it. She was extremely abused and has carried that fear with her to this day, even after restraining orders and having his rights to me removed. We’ve moved states, ceased all communication, etc. 

I’ve watched this man from a distance, out of natural curiosity. Despite what he did, that’s half of me that I still don’t understand. I don’t even want to talk to him, because I’d be left with more questions than answers. 

Since my mother finally left him, he has had at least one daughter (F,20) and one son (C,12) who both now have Facebook. I’ve watched F on Facebook for a while now, and she and I are almost one in the same when it comes to interests, politics, and art. She’s friends with my father, but they don’t seem to interact. C just started his profile, but has already shown some signs of resentment toward our father on his page. I’ve never seen a picture of him smiling, especially when standing next to my father. The curious side of me started wondering, if I contacted her.... would she run to my father and tell him that the child who got away, who he’s tried contacting multiple times, is in fact responsive? Or could she keep a secret for the sake of being able to ask questions of her own?

I really considered this but became extremely anxious after a while. I was balancing the risk of terrifying my mother with the possibility of finding some closure when I realized that F and C may not even know I exist. Part of me started to feel as though it would be really unfair of me to contact this 20 year old girl, shock the shit out of her and reveal she has more siblings than she thought, just to leave her life after because I have no intentions of having a relationship with that family. I just have a lot of questions. Especially regarding family history. I’m also bipolar, have anger issues, and struggled with a minor addiction. I didn’t know my father had this diagnosis until long after mine, because my mother “didn’t want me to look for the symptoms in myself and convince myself I was bipolar too.” What else don’t I know? What else should I know? My mother is really hard to talk to about this, because she’s terrified of him.

bx8snb	2019-06-05 22:21:38	RedPandaEnthusiast	AITA? Calling my fiancé fat	"*Edit*: he left me, saying that seeing me gain weight was more “exciting” to him than seeing me lose it.

I (29F) and my fiancé (30M) have been together for almost 10 years. In that time, I’ve gone from 300 pounds to 130 and then back up to 150 due to an injury keeping me less active.

My soon to be husband has stayed about the same weight this entire time. When I began my weight loss journey he would join me at the gym and diet with me, he soon fell off the wagon and went back to an unhealthy eating style. He’s not obese but he does have a few extra pounds. I’ve never minded and it hasn’t affected our relationship in any way.

However, my latest gain has been quite recent. I was cleared by my doctor for physical activity last week, but with the schedule I have I haven’t been able to make it to the gym.

This morning, I was struggling to button up some pants, and my fiancé verbatim said “yeah I would just stop trying if I were you, you’re just getting fat again.” I couldn’t believe my ears. I just started yelling, called him fat and called him out on his daily laziness. He knows I’ve been injured and he knows I’ve been insecure about my recent weight gain.

I apologized a little while later but he just shrugged it off and hasn’t been talking to me. I know what I did was wrong but I don’t think he has a right to ignore me at this point..

Niece B (Niece A’s cousin) will be attending and she’s informed me that she’s in Alcoholic’s Anonymous. I was not aware she had a drinking problem, but applauded her for her getting help. She asked me if the event could be sober. I said that Niece A was graduating from college and would want her favorite drinks to celebrate and it wasn’t fair to her to take that away. I said I would have plenty of non-alcoholic beverages, as always, however. She kicked up a fuss and said that if we don’t make it 100% alcohol-free, then she’s not coming.

Niece A (22) isn’t a big drinker, only on special occasions and she said she’s not going to give it up for this. Niece B’s mom actually sided with myself and Niece A, saying that she’s been around alcohol before with friends since becoming sober so there’s nothing with family. My wife thinks we should just have it be sober to avoid family drama. To be honest, this niece has always tried to make everything about her. I’m not saying that about her drinking problem but every event is always about making sure everyone knows she is the star of the show. She’s 19 and I’m wondering when it will end.

bx8rre	2019-06-05 22:19:24	BrodyMeader14	Wibta if I call my Uncle on his sh*t.	"So some back story the guy in the title is my actual uncle he was married to my aunt years ago so he was at one time so we’ll just call him “uncle”. He has two daughters and he dose not work to improve his life (he’s worked at the same car wash for 25 years). His older daughter is high functioning autistic (enough to do childish things,act weird,  and not understand adult stuff like drive but she has a job( important for the story) and have a civil conversation)we’ll call her Cousin A. The younger sister we’ll call her cousin B she gets anything she wants not to draw it out she’s a spoiled brat.
       Cousin A works for or family restaurant it’s a 60s diner vibe and she makes minimum wage as a dishwasher, she’s not the best at her job she gets distracted and does other stuff but she tries and is not half bad at the job. My uncle is a prick when he picks her up and drives her home he charges her gas money for his own daughter she pitches in half for groceries and pays 450$ for rent so basically he takes advantage of her. Not to get to deep but my aunt and grandparents mentality abused her to be normal by belittling and insulting her (we’ve cut them off from the family but she still has a tough life) And she got bullied at school for loving Pokémon and she dressed weird.
       Once when she was about 15 she went to DC for a school trip, cousin 2 stole and hid 4 or 5 Pokémon plushies and hid them in her room and when cousin 1 came back from her trip she asked cousin 2 where they were and cousin 2 wouldn’t give them back she went to my Uncle and my uncle started yelling at her for “being a snitch” and “your to old for them get over it”.
I try to have a close relationship but she’s very introverted and didn’t want to leave or go do something. 
       So my big question is would I be an asshole if I called him on his shit and call him a selfish prick or is that to much?

bx8nvo	2019-06-05 22:10:08	jphuxley	AITA for yelling at my ex?	"My ex, F 23, broke up with me, M 26, several months ago. She’s someone who values physical fitness a lot, but even more so she values physical attractiveness. Honestly, for the most part she is a fun, friendly person. She has her faults, such as being a compulsive liar and she sometimes says hurtful things. 

Anyways, I was always a fit guy with visible musculature. Not a bodybuilder body, but I’m an avid rock climber. Anyways, I hurt myself pretty bad over a year ago, and couldn’t work out or climb at all without severe pain. Could barely turn my neck. So, for a year my goal was recovery, not developing some perfect body. Anyways, my girlfriend couldn’t take it and broke up with me saying that I just wasn’t physically attractive anymore. What pissed me off was that she knows that I have very severe body dysmorphic disorder. The worst part is that she has shamed me quite a bit in the past when she thinks my body isn’t quite up to her standards. She’ll even shame me for things I can’t control like my hair, facial features, my hook shaped nose. Part of me suspects she does these things to manipulate me, because she’ll praise me too. I know that’s a common strategy to manipulate people, praising them and then bringing them down, but I can’t prove that she meant to do that. 

I respect her right to break up with me. But I guess I was really just upset that she’s been so manipulative to me all this time, I just lost it and called her a f***ing b**ch. I’ve never said anything like that to her before. It’s just, I grew up with an abusive mother who would make fun of my physical appearance, tell me how weird I look. And my gf knew this. I felt like she took advantage of my vulnerability by insulting me with what I’m most sensitive to. 

I’m a capable guy. Losing her didn’t ruin me. Life is still pretty much the same. But I do feel hurt by all the insults she’s directed at me. Now she says I’m the abuser for what I said, but that was the first and only time I’ve ever yelled at her. I’d never insulted her before."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Subsequently, my half sister was born and my dad came clean to my mom and they decided it would be best if he lived this convoluted double life where he’d occasionally take off and have family time with his second kid but I’d never know about it. A LOT of holidays were spent without him being there. At the time they told me he was working. 

I’m 24 now and out of nowhere I got a Facebook message from this girl who looks exactly like the girl version of me claiming to be my sister. She told me my dad was also her dad and I went straight to him and he confirmed it all. 

He and my mom figured that because I know the truth now, we should be this one creepy happy family and that I should get to know my sister. I was furious at my mom for not seeing my POV even though she had been cheated on. She told me to ‘mind my own business and it was a long time ago’ and was really pushing me to get to know my sister. My dad was also really into the idea and my half sister kept bugging me until my dad gave her my number and she kept trying to message me, call me, etc. She was desperate on the phone to have a sibling bond. 

I’ve stopped talking to both my parents and changed my cell phone number, as well as moving to a completely new apartment where they don’t know my address. I’m really angry over this and all my friends keep telling me to get over it because in honesty no one got hurt and the mature decision would be to accept my new life. They told me I went full nuclear and I was rude to my half sister when I should have been nice. 

However I’m really angry at both my parents and I literally can’t get over the feeling I’ve been betrayed by them both. My girlfriend is still Facebook friends with my mom and my mom is always begging my girlfriend to tell me to reconcile but I just don’t want to. My gf is solidly on my team but she tells me I need to calm down and think about this. In my mind I’m not the asshole but I do keep getting told by my friends that I am.

My 29-year old roommate led a mission trip about two years ago for our church. My sister, who didn't go to the church,  wanted to come for the experience. During the trip, her and my roommate hit it off, which I did bother me a little bit since my roommate practically ignored me to hang out with my sister.

Two years later, she comes to my house to help me move and sees my roommate. They start chatting while I was packing up. Later, my roommate asks me if he can have my garage opener for the house when he ""hangs out with Tiffany"" (my sister).

I was really disturbed by it and even told my dad about it, who was also unsettled by the idea. I texted him back saying, ""Please don't hang out with my sister. My dad finds it even more unsettling than me. If you have a problem with it then take it up him, thanks.""

He texts back this needlessly long text full of paragraphs that called me out for saying when it was unsettling when he didn't see how it could be and how they bonded over the trip and how she's an adult and can make her own decisions and how I'm just looking for drama with him.

We have tried to keep it work and stay friends but it's been a difficult few months and she's been very hot and cold. All it's done is make me feel miserable and hanging on to what we had and after she was rather rude with me today I decided I'd had enough.

Through my school I have a gym membership which gives access to the gym but also school grounds. She has been using the gym since our break up and her name is still on the pass.

I had enough and cancelled the pass today but haven't told her as quite frankly I would rather not speak to her. I feel really guilty now and mean for doing this and don't want it to come as a shock.

bx8kw9	2019-06-05 22:03:08	pigontherun	AITA for leaving my roommates	"I had 3 college roommates last year (2 bedroom, 2 bath, shared kitchen and living room, fully furnished). I’ll call them A, B, and C. C has decided not to live with us next year due to not liking B and has given us months of notice.  

A has applied to be an RA and has been told that anytime during the year can be called on to become an RA.  A has requested we live in a different apartment building (one where she can “get out of her lease” in the middle of the year).  She then asked if me and C would cover her lease if she became an RA and left since she wouldn’t be living there.  I told her no and that she would have to find a replacement person or covering her part of the lease.  C, to my surprise, said yes she would split A’s lease with me if she left.  

At our apartment from last year A would not be able to get out of the lease and throw it on us so I asked if we could live here again and I would take a random roommate in my room to fill B’s room, who’s leaving.  Both of them were not too keen on the idea of even sharing a kitchen and living room with a random person.  

We have been looking into a few places but they are not furnished and utilities are not included (like our old place).   Once adding utilities they will be roughly the same price as our old place or a little more expensive.   A and B are okay with this because they have items (bed, bed frame, desk, dresser) at home that they can bring, but I do not.  They keep telling me to find used items for cheap online.  Which there are of you search hard enough... But after buying them, I will still be paying for these items to be moved in and out of my apartment for the summer as well as a place to store them because I can’t keep it in my parents house for 3 and a half months during the year.  

A is my best friend at school and B is very good friend.  When everything seemingly started to hit the fan, I reached out to someone in our old building who I knew was looking for a roommate.  I let A and B know I was looking into rooming with someone else or commuting.  

Last night I told them I was gonna live with someone else from our old building. I feel like now it will be way harder for them with only 2 people and maybe more money, especially if A leaves the lease to be an RA in the middle of the year.  They may have to commute or even be forced to live with random people which I know they didn’t want to do.   AITA for this not living with them next year...?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I never put much thought into it before today, when a co-worker got pretty mad at me for exposing my dogs to secondhand smoke.

AC = annoying classmate
OC = Other classmate
ACF = annoying classmate friend

Today, at art class, AC started throwing tiny balls of paper on my sculpture, which I just finished painting. The problem is that these tiny balls could let mark the paint. I told AC to stop, but he continued. After a moment, I decided to take one of the paper balls and dipped it in paint. I throwed it on the AC and it stained his T-Shirt and is pants. I not expecting to dirt the pants, and I took attention of using a paint color close to his shirt color. He was very angry, said I had no excuse, and yelled at me instead of cleaning. I precise after the class, my own clothes were full of paint and I was able to clean that. AC told me I made exactly like OC last class. I didn’t understood, but he told me I was a liar. ACF told me last class, OC trowed on AC glue. AC and ACF were very angry. I apologized to AC, but he told me to shut up.

AC has often been disrespectful to me, telling me to “Shut up” or “not him again” even when I didn’t made anything, said anything or just said “Hi”. By the past, he pushed on me a hot glue gun (heated, so it hurt me) on me by negligence (I don’t think it was intentional, but it was very imprudent) He didn’t apologized. ACF was most of the time nice to me. I honestly don’t think I had been an asshole to AC and ACF.

Now, I feel guilty and I think I overreacted. It was puerile to throw him paint, but he continued to throw paper on my sculpture even when I asked him to stop. The fact AC has never been nice to me change nothing about the fact it is wrong to dirt his clothes. I think AC overacted too, but that doesn’t excuse me."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

He landed on my mother and went for an earong. Knlwing full well this little guy has the strength and determination to rip things out of ears she took her hand and covered her ear. He for some unknown reason has this weird love-hate relationship with my mother and will bite her. I come to get him and before I can he bites her hand. And she throws her hand and he goes kinda hurling through the air. He lands fine and on a soft surface and i go to check on him. He seems fine and i am quite upset anyway. Parrots are delicate creatures. I get very upset and kinda tell my mom she shouldn't habe done that and explain why and onxe ive put him away after ranting a bit i walk off and go ""i don't speak to people that treat animals that way."" And this happened yesterday and we haven't like spoken much bc we've just both been doing our own thing.

I have not ever spoken to our neighbor behind and to the left of our house. We live on different streets and only really share about 20ft of fencing because the properties are offset a bit. Their school age/preteen children just let themselves into our back yard. We don’t have cameras so I have no clue if it has happened before. They didn’t stay long (my kid and I were outside) but the fact that there is a gate to their yard kinda bothers me. I didn’t know this existed. There are small metal frames on our side and I honestly thought they were there for reinforcement put there by the previous owners as portions of our fence do need to be replaced at some point due to damage. No handle or anything on our side of the fence other than what I now know are hinges. I’m thinking of putting something simple like a hook and eye style little latch or like a public bathroom  style lock on my side would be appropriate just to make sure my fencing and yard stays secure. WIBTA if I installed some sort of lock on our side of the gate so they don’t enter our yard in the future?		1	0
bx8gxb	2019-06-05 21:53:40	trash_account12323	AITA for worrying about my mental heath	"So ive been talking to this girls for months started with me liking her but turned in to me just being friends. I quickly got the idea that she needed help  and as i talked with her more i realized that she struggled with motivation. So i started to help her in every way i could. i would encourage her to do the work needed even making deals with small bribes of stuff like food to give her  some motivation to do the work. My whole goal was to be the person i wish i had when i went through a time very similar to hers. 

Time goes on and we are still talking and are very close. I am comfortable telling her stuff id never tell anyone else and same for her. I have been and currently am going through a really hard time with family school ap tests and getting a job and my actions start to show a bit. We can both be very rude to each other at some points in time like siblings and one of these times for me happened over snapchat where i was doing something she didnt want me to do (doesnt matter what i should not have done it, it was rude on my part I accept that). She ended up blocking me on snap. The next few days are weird she talks to me like normal we goof around but a few days after being blocked i asked if i was gonna be unblocked. I didn't care either way but this on the fence thing was stressing me out. She proceeded to say “Ill unblock u in 2 days” to which I say ok and somehow later i annoy her and she says “woop thats another day blocked”. And this causes more stress and makes me feel like shes playing a game with me and i feel like its really rude more than a joke. 

A few days later i'm still blocked life is still shiting on me and my stress is controlling me. when someone is on the fence and will talk to me at school like nothing is wrong but ignore you with any other types of communication where I wasnt blocked, it causes me a lot of stress. This would have been fine if i was my normal self but like i said a lot i wasn't in a good place in fact quite the opposite and i couldnt deal with this unease any longer. I write a paragraph of feelings asking for her to make a choice. I needed her to either unblock me and continue being friends and work out our problems, or leave me blocked and we can continue our separate ways cause the stress was consuming me and i just couldnt take it anymore. Long story short she says she isnt unblocking me, she doesnt plan on talking to me and she doesnt want my help anymore. I move on and a few days later i get word from a good friend that shes talking crap about me. It bothers me a bit but i'm respecting what she wants and leaving her alone. While her choice makes me really sad that our friendship ended this way my stress level has lowered a lot.  However i'm left wondering aita? I feel justifidied in my actions but there is part of me which makes me think i'm the asshole and that maybe I wasnt in the right.

bx8gl7	2019-06-05 21:52:50		AITA for telling my brother he’s irresponsible?	"Hey guys, long post about something that seems minor but it isn’t and I was hoping for some help.

I’m an 18 year old male from the UK and live with my 23 year old brother and 43 year old full time working mother. We’ve had issues with the kitchen sink being blocked for a while now and the council doesn’t help us with it too much. There is an issue where the washing machine pipes are messed up and when we turn it on water comes through the sink. Anyway, today it happened again so it needed to be pumped. My mum works as a cleaner at a school and works also as a cook at the lunch hall, working 9 hours a day. I heard her pumping the sink and so I went to help. I asked my brother if he could try pumping it so she doesn’t have to and he reluctantly asked mum if she wanted help (clearly hoping to be turned away) while I went to the toilet quickly. When I came back he had gone to the bedroom and my mum told me had tried to pump the sink twice, got annoyed by the dirty water and walked away. So I unblocked the sink, trying for 30 minutes while he sat in the bedroom. I go to him and ask him why he didn’t help to which he replied that he didn’t want to because he had suggested buying a sink unblocker to my mum but she hadn’t listened and therefore he didn’t need to help. He used multiple analogies to explain his point of view none of which made sense to me. I got annoyed at his attitude and he began to say “what do you ever do for the house?” I was left out of the conversation regarding the sink before so I said in the moment of a potential flood, what he suggested two weeks ago doesn’t help right now even though his suggestion is right. He then went on to say that he doesn’t like doing it due to the dirty water getting on him to which I asked him if he thinks I like it. He said that “you like it more than I do so you do it and you’re better at it.” This just made me furious. I sat two A Level exams today both of which were 2 hours long and my mother worked 9 hours whereas he is unemployed and a university drop out and is usually on his phone in bed or on his laptop writing scripts (he has hopes of being a film writer and director which I think he’ll achieve). Despite being stronger than me and also older, he refused to help because he expected me to do it due to the phone calls he makes on behalf of our mum (we’re foreign). Also, another reason he claimed excused him from helping us pump the sink was that my mum had been trying for a long time and so had I so why would he do something that hasn’t worked. But I unblocked it after 30 minutes of effort.

Sorry for such a long read and I know it seems like a very small problem but the sink represents responsibility which he clearly isn’t willing to do - whether it be working (unemployed for a couple years) or helping out in the house. Am I the asshole?"		1	0

Anyway, she saw me come in with a plastic bag for my lunch and ran up to me. ""What's in that bag? What's that? What you got?"" She literally did not take a breath between questions. I told her it was my lunch for the day and she kept asking what it was. 

It was my aunt's leftover red beans and rice with a dinner roll and a drink. There wasn't even that much rice left. It was just enough so I wouldn't be starving when I got home from work. 

Later on that night I ate my lunch and Lisa came up when I was done, saying I didn't offer her any. I told her I wasn't obligated to offer her any food. Especially since she ate two hamburgers, two servings of tater tots and then had an aide go get her Burger King just an hour before. She got her food and I wanted my food to be my food for once. Don't even think about ordering a pizza in a nursing home. You'll be lucky to eat one slice of your own pizza. 

One aide said that I was selfish. She said when she has a burger, she gives Lisa half. Then she said sharing is caring.

We caught up on a lot of things, but then my brother complained about dating. He is tall, handsome, kind, but a little shy and quiet when he meets people for the first time, and you know how it goes.

Dad and I said it's normal, but I added: ""Anyway, brother, you should go abroad to find a girlfriend or wife, just as soon as you graduate, women in \[our country\] are terrible.""

My dad said, ""Hey, don't say that"" and I said ""Not all of them or your generation, but things are so bad here at this moment."" No one takes care of themself, their health, their life. There are not many really great women (there are few but not many), so it is difficult to go out with other people. Meanwhile, there are other countries where women take better care of themselves, they are easier to know, etc. I mentioned Sweden, Japan, and Israel in particular is much better than \[our country\]. (I've been lucky to travel for my job. There are other parts of the world so different than here.)

After that my father laughed and my brother thought it sounded intriguing, but then he mentioned it to our mother later and she was much more upset than I expected, and she told me not to despise people. But it's true our country totally sucks now and everyone who has been away from here knows it. Women in our country are much worse than other countries in the way they treat themselves and their partners. I thought my brother should know this, and maybe he would have a happier life.

He hands me an aerial to play tv channels on it, so I connect it. Although the signal is shit I manage to get a good connection by holding the aerial in the air and all is good. Picture is great, sound is great and I changed channels for him so he can see the quality of it also.

He was satisfied with the product and handed over the cash. 

2 hours later he messaged me asking for a refund. He stated that the TV channels are changing by itself, and that the volume is frantically changing. Stated the TV has turned itself off a few times and that basically the TV is going crazy.

My husbands high school friend lives in our apartment complex and they have an aggressive dog, which they like to sit outside with. Now normally this wouldn’t be a problem, plenty of people in our complex sit outside with their dogs if the weather is nice, but they don’t leash their dog and their dog doesn’t listen to their commands. When I was taking my own dog out to use the bathroom this dog has spotted our pup, ran down a flight of stairs, and ran to our dog barking up a storm and snapping its jaws. Once when my husband was taking him out they actually got into a fight that definitely would’ve gotten worse for our dog since his friends was at least 100 pounds and ours is only about 25-30. And then it happened again a couple days later when we were both out.
 If my husband wasn’t with me i would not have been able to get between them and stop it if anything did happen ,being 29 weeks pregnant and already having no upper body strength. When we had went back inside once his friend actually got control of his dog and ours could potty we were talking about it and i had remembered it happening a long time ago with my ex roommates dog, a dachshund puppy. I told him I was going to report them and he told me to leave it alone and not report them because they were good friends in highschool. 
I went down to the office after he had left for work and told them what happened and that my only problem was that they don’t leash their dog while outside with it and gave them their apartment number. I texted my husband and told him i had reported them because i couldn’t take the chance of me walking our dog by myself and his friends dog came and attacked ours, plus we couldn’t afford vet bills if something does happen so something had to happen, and now he’s upset with me."

bx84j9	2019-06-05 21:23:25	ajssoisijoa	AITA for kicking my daughter out of the house?	"Hi all. 

My daughter Lucy is 22. She is an accountant working for a big firm in London, having graduated uni top of her class last year and is working towards getting her chartered status. 

Last Saturday she went on a night out with her friends and nothing seemed to be the problem. But today I was scrolling through facebook and noticed something. Lucy and several other people (some of whom I know as friends of hers, were tagged in a large video post. I had a look, and it showed a group of about 30-40 young people in a supermarket car park at night. They were drinking and smoking what appeared to be cannabis joints and were playing music loudly. They had a car there and were taking it in turns to swerve it and drive it around the area at high speeds. I could clearly see Lucy and her girl friends in the group.

A second video showed a police officer shouting at the group, and they all responded - including Lucy -  by shouting verbal abuse and threats at him. Whoever was in the car even accelerated towards the officer to make him go back. 

I don't know what happened next. Lucy got home OK and seemed perfectly fine the next morning (minus a hangover). 

When Lucy got home from work I showed her the video and demanded to know what she was thinking. She said the gathering was ''a laugh'' and doesn't have any regrets ''Nobody got hurt'' she said to me. Her mum was just as angry. Obviously Lucy isn't a school kid so we can't ground her or anything like that. We did give her a stern talking to but in response she had a huge crying tantrum saying we were trying to control her and stop her having fun. 

In response to this we told her to pack her bags and get out. She cried even more at this and stormed out without taking anything. 

We phoned her a few times but she didn't answer. I got a phone call half an hour ago from the mum of Lucy's best friend Tina, saying that Lucy was going to stay at their place tonight. From her tone of voice it seemed like she thought it was wrong of us to kick her out. 

We both love Lucy but to be honest her behaviour has driven us to this point. She is very smart and career focused but at home is very lazy. She expects her mum and I to cook for her and clean up after her, and at times shouts at us if food isn't ready quick enough. She commutes to work but if she's going anywhere else she expects us to drop whatever we are doing and give her a lift. We have suggested she learn to drive but she has stated that she won't commit to driving lessons unless we promise to buy her a car straight away. We also pay her phone bill. 

I don't think I did the wrong thing by telling her to get out, but my wife has been crying and telling me to phone Lucy and let her come home. I think having to spend the night homeless might just be a wakeup call that this can't continue."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx844l	2019-06-05 21:22:28	Skullfire2099	Update - AITA for considering breaking up with my girlfriend because of her white hair dog?	"[OP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/boglvq/aita_for_considering_breaking_up_with_my/)

I made the post 22 days ago and I have a small update to it. I made the post with some heavy jet lag, having flown to visit my GF across the pond. I was tired after the long flight on top of other stress, 2 people and a dog stuck in one small room with lots of strangers in a foreign country and I didnt speak the language. Yes that is stressful. The dog is a husky border collie mix that was rescued off the street in Romania. On top of the shedding he didn't like me and didn't listen to me after a few days. At times he would growl at me coming around him or my GF. 

Then a few days after my post I left where we were staying with my GF and her dog to go to her place. There I was able to sleep in, have space, have time to think and de-stress. I saw a video on my GFs computer of her dog at the shelter. He was happy to see the people at the kennel and he was looking forward to attention/food from them. After that video it made me realize that he was new to the situation and not scared or aggressive like I thought he was as my GF only had him for a few weeks when I first met him. I went through the trick routine that my GF went through with him, rewarding him with cheese, for several days. Then I started walking him on my own. By the end of my trip he was excited for me to even put my hand on his leash, he followed my commands, and we became best buds. My GF even has good picture of him cuddling with me on the couch. Now that I am back home her dog has been mopping around and laying in the chair that I was sitting in most of the time and I miss him. We were rough housing at one point. I was playing on all 4s when he crawled underneath me and rolled over to expose his belly and neck to me, a completely submissive move on his part.


**TLDR** Made my OP out of stress, had time to calm down, me and the dog are best friends now. I miss the little fur ball.

bx83hu	2019-06-05 21:21:02		WIBTA if I were to dump my recovering alcoholic boyfriend?	"Me and my boyfriend have only been together for a little over a month and I just found that he's been lying to me about what he does every other Tuesday. He's currently on probation for a DUI he got last Fall and he's been attending court-ordered DUI programs meant for rehabilitation, alcohol testing, and paying fines and fees. He's been keeping this a secret from me in our time together and I just found out about all of it. He also told me that he's going to start community service as well.

I was upset with him for lying about this and I made him aware of my anger. He told me that he's been sober since the DUI, he's served his jail time, and he's attending all of his classes to get better. He keeps claiming to be a better person and trying to change, but I really can't help but feel badly about this. My last boyfriend before him also had a drinking problem and I'm honestly getting flashbacks to that relationship now.

I'd be lying if I said breaking up wasn't an option on the table for me. I want to believe that he's changing for the better and he's putting in the effort to clean up his act, but I honestly don't know. Breaking up with him at this point in his life feels like a scummy thing for me to do. What do you think?"		1	0
bx835x	2019-06-05 21:20:18	catus_star	WIBTA if I called CPS on a mom because of guns in her house?	"So a few months ago my two children ages 2 and 5, and I were over at my five year old friends house. Everything was going great and the visit was going well, we were almost done with the visit. My five year old was playing with a flashlight, and shining it underneath their coffee table that was right next to the table. I was sitting on the couch next to him talking to his friends mom. The next thing I know my five year old says ""what's this?"" And he proceeded to pull a handgun out from underneath the coffee table. The gun had a clip in it. I quickly took it away from him as carefully as possible and his friends mom was freaking out and took it from me. She put it up and told me it wasn't loaded, but I know it had a clip in it. 
The whole situation freaked me out and scared me because who knows what could have happened. God forbid if my two year old would have gone under the table and found it.
We haven't gone back over to his friends house for obvious reasons. 
But after opening up to one of my friends and telling her what happened, she said I should call CPS. I'm kind of scared for my son's friend since there was a gun within reach of a small child. I don't want anyone to get hurt, but I also don't want to potentially put a family through a huge crappy situation. I would also be afraid of them figuring out that I was the one who reported them.

Edit: After reading all of the comments and really thinking about the situation more, I think I will talk to her and let her know my feelings about what happened. I don't think I will be bringing my children over to her house ever, but I'm willing to have a conversation with her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx81va	2019-06-05 21:17:05	Aishe_C	AITA if I refuse to dance with someone in class?	"I've been attending salsa lessons for a few months now and I love it. During class we switch partners every few minutes, so everybody has a chance to dance. People are civil and despite some natural accidents (stepping on each others feet, missplacing hands, missing the beat)  things have been great, until a few weeks ago, when a new guy came.

To paint a picture: he is full of himself, he thinks he can dance way better than it shows and is generally bad at taking advice from the instructor. Plus, he smells really, really bad. 

I danced with him a few times in class, he kept placing my hands how he thoght right, blaming me for not dancing ok and ""accidentally"" touching my boobs. Now, I've been a begginer not so long ago and made a point in being nice to everybody who is just starting, I know it's a process and it's not my place to correct anybody. But the smell kills me. I feel like fainting, the guy has obviously not showered in days. He doesn't seem to notice and keeps acting up and being arrogant. I'm loosing all the fun in dancing because of him.

Initially I asked my instructor for advice. She told me she'll keep an eye on him. Nothing changed.

So for the last few lessons I refused to dance with him. Today, other girls followed suit and thanked me in private for doing it, since it gave them the courage to refuse him as well.

He is taking it badly, complaining in class that we won't dance with him. He still doesn't shower and keps blaming us for turning him down.

Should I have acted differently? Part of me wonders if I should have told him in private that his personal hygene could be improved. Then again, I don't think it's my place, I hardly know his name. So AITA for acting like I did?

We continued to be friends for multiple months and still enjoy each other’s company. We were recently talking, and she brought up the fact she never really liked me as more than a friend, she just dated me to be nice and she figured I would be so disappointed if she said no.

I remained calm after she said that but I was so shocked and furious on the inside. I blocked her immediately and tried to avoid talking to her whenever I can. I loved being friends with her.

I go to the club a few times a month, sometimes it's a cover charge with a ticket costing $15-20, sometimes it'll be free entry with RSVP. This particular night was free.

There's a bar there, of course, for serving drinks. However, they do not serve tap water, instead you have to pay $5-6 for a small (not even 16.9 oz - it's 330ml/11.5 oz) bottle of Fiji water. They also rig the faucets in the bathrooms to only give warm water, so you can't refill a water bottle unless you want to drink warm water. Also, expectedly, you can't bring a water bottle in.

So, the bartender has to just reach behind him and grab a water bottle. I don't even remember if they were room temp or kept cold - I want to say the former. Because all they have to do is reach behind them, AITA for not tipping a dollar on the water bottle?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I didn’t think much of it but then I got pulled into my supervisors office and he told me that the man had complained that I was being unprofessional and that he had gotten in a car accident that actually ended up killing his wife and seriously injuring his son. They were here meeting with a faculty member to put together a charity event which is why he was here all bandaged up freshly. I assume physical and emotional wounds are still very very fresh.

My supervisor is a good guy so he didn’t write me up but told me to smarten up and don’t be an asshole to random strangers. I didn’t think I was being an asshole, it’s like a cliche hack common joke I was just trying to lighten the mood. My SO also thinks I was an asshole in the situation.

I hear about this accident and am extremely saddened to hear it was him. I donate to the gofund me page, share it on fb and I attended the “service”. I didn’t get a chance to give his wife my condolences personally, but again, felt very sorry for them. 

A week later, in my email I received a message from gofund me saying that she thanks me and sent me a message. The message said “why do you bother me, a widow. You do the devils work. Poor girl” I wanted to reply that I felt sorry for her, and feel more sorry for her now. 

But instead I called my bank and asked to dispute the donation and have my money refunded.  I would have been completely fine with no response.

bx7wlz	2019-06-05 21:04:36	Unlust	AITA for being upset about my pizza delivery?	"Hi Reddit,

So one night I decided to order pizza. I settled for my favourite pizza shop. The thing is, the place is roughly a 3 minute walk from my apartment, but I didn't really plan on leaving my apartment that evening, since I'm a stoner and was already pretty high.

So I went about ordering my pizza and all is fine, but the pizza takes forever to arrive. After roughly 1 hour where the status of my order didn't change, I called up the pizza shop and politely asked about my order. The guy on the phone, who I later found out was the owner, informed me, that my order was basically ready to be delivered, but they were waiting for a delivery guy to come pick it up. The app I used has their own delivery guys, so it wasn't really the owners fault.

Anyway, I waited for another half an hour and at this point I'm getting really frustrated. I called up again, and the owner informed me, that they were still waiting for a delivery guy. He then asked me if it would be possible for me to come pick the pizza up myself. Now I was starving at this point and got really frustrated, so I wasn't as polite anymore and complained that I originally ordered a pizza to have it delivered and that I can come pick it up, but that I'm not happy about it.

As luck would have it, as soon as I arrived at the pizza place, the delivery guy arrived as well. Now here's the part where I'm really not sure if I was being unreasonable.

Basically, I wanted to complain to the delivery guy, but he was very pissed that he came to the pizza place for no reason after all, since I was already there to pick it up. The thing is though, the delivery guy was extremely rude to me during this whole conversation. At the end he asked me why I would even order a pizza from here even though I live in walking distance.

This was the last straw for me. Please keep in mind that at this point it was like 11pm (I ordered the pizza at 9pm), I was planning to go to sleep early, was extremely hungry and frustrated, so I pretty much just snapped at him (did not scream at him) and loudly argued with him about the whole situation for everybody in the store to hear, which wasn't intended, but just happened.

At the end I made the delivery guy call the company and tell them, that I had picked up the order by myself so I have proof when complaining to them later.

The delivery guy left and I felt terrible for the owners, so I left them a tip, apologized and told them that I realise its not their fault. They were extremely kind and professional during all of this and even gave me a free side dish.

So.. AITA?

TL;DR: Ordered pizza, waited half an hour, went to pick it up myself, arrived at the same time as the delivery guy and got into an argument."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx7wk7	2019-06-05 21:04:29		AITA for getting a ticket salesperson at my local movie theatre fired?	"This happened when I was 18, but I still feel really guilty about it.

So I went to see a production of rocky horror with my friends, and I presented the ticket guy with my driver’s license. He looked at it and at me and said “are you sure you’re not IN the show?” And I said “what does that mean?” He goes “I’m saying you’re busted, dude. You look scary.”

I was an 18 year old female in the midst of an eating disorder. My hair was thinning, I had dark circles under my eyes, my skin was pale and my bones were sticking out. I know I looked freakish, but his blatant insult shocked me.

I called the theatre after having a good cry, and on impulse I told the manager that I looked so messed up / my hair was falling out because I was sick, so the comments really cut deep. They fired him instantly and I never saw him there again.

I know when I said “sick”, they thought I meant something really bad, like cancer. I was just struggling with disordered eating. Sure the dude was a dick, but I feel like I lied and cost this guy his job when he might have just been having a bad day. I can’t help but wonder if they would’ve fired him had I not claimed to be sick. Maybe they were afraid of legal repercussions since I claimed to be ill. Anyway, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bx7w4x	2019-06-05 21:03:29	HokiePie	AITA if I don't eat with my in laws during pregnancy	"One of the things that makes me hesitate to get pregnant again is that dealing with my in laws during my first pregnancy was unpleasant. I don't like their cooking, but if they invite us over, I am polite and take some food and eat what I can and never say anything negative. If they come to my house, my husband and I try to make something they would like but they've never shown any interest in learning about my tastes or preferences.

However, when I was pregnant the first time, it felt to me like they were especially uncaring. For one example out of many, they asked if they could bring food over and my husband told them clearly and specifically that meat was making me sick so they shouldn't bring it. As soon as they came over, they opened up a container of not just meat, but greasy, smelly meat, and put it in the middle of the table. They then informed us that they couldn't eat dinner without meat. They did not bring an alternative main dish for me, but I spent the evening over the toilet anyway because of the smell of the meat. They did not apologize.

Would I be the asshole if I told my husband that if I'm to try to get pregnant again, I will decline to eat with my in laws any time I feel a food aversion and expect him to back me up and not pressure me into going? Nothing in their current behavior has indicated that they would be more considerate in the future, and if we tried to serve them a meal without meat at our house, they would complain the entire time - I know from experience. I feel like their behavior is unreasonable and I shouldn't have to subject myself to the added stress while pregnant, but I can also understand if the judgment is that I should suck it up (or in this case, vomit it out) for the sake of keeping good relationships.

Edit: The reason why I'm honestly not sure if IATA and I'm not just looking for people to tell me my ILs are assholes is because I'm constantly struggling with finding a balance between the amount of time (none) that I'd like to spend with my in laws vs. not pressuring my husband and daughter into spending less time with them. They seem to have some kind of learned mental block against being considerate and thoughtful, but they aren't abusive and I've agreed that I'm not pushing for no contact, so it always feels kind of assholish for me to be trying to reduce time with them."

Well, this happened yesterday at a Chili’s that I went to with my friends to celebrate our graduation. We were being served our food when I notice a waitress with a nice ass. I text my friend to look to his right and he just laughs and shakes his head. He is usually talking about stuff like clapping cheeks and what not so I just said it and didn’t think much of it. We come back to school today (one of the last days at school) and he asks if anyone wants to hear something I said yesterday. My other friends say yes and he looks to me to see if he is allowed to say it. He says what I said and my friends just laugh a little and joke about it. But I have this one friend, (she’s my ex and we have been talking for a couple weeks now and she’s admitted to liking me and I like her too but she just doesn’t know if she wants to date) let’s call her A. So A was laughing along with this too, but by second period, her mood seemed to change. She looked sad and was laying her head on the table and had this distant look in her eyes. I asked her what was wrong in class but she just shrugged. I texted her later and she said it was because of what I did. She was jealous and hurt. I felt really bad, but I didn’t know it would turn out this way. She said she was so happy with how things were going but me saying that made her sad. She said that I always talked about how I liked her and how much I meant to her, but that clearly didn’t mean anything since I said something like that. She wants to be normal friends again and she told me that she doesn’t trust me as much as she used to. No flirting, no sending each other pictures, no feelings attached. Just normal friends.

TL;DR   I said that a waitress had a nice ass as a joke and my friend who had feelings for me got mad at me and now doesn’t want to talk how we used to and wants to be “normal friends”"	No A-holes here	0	0

We ended up having a bad family disagreement with her and some other family members and long story short, I told her husband exactly what she said to me in the car. He took her side and said he just “couldn’t trust us”.

bx7s8k	2019-06-05 20:54:06		AITA for waiting nearly a month to tell a guy my plans to join the military?	"I [18F] met someone [25M] on Tinder in the middle of May. We hung out for the first time less than a week ago then again two days ago. I met a few people from Tinder the past few months and not once was it serious. I wasn’t looking for anything serious and there was no signs he was either at first. I moved an hour away from him the other day. He was already freaking out because long distance scares him and he became super pushy with making plans with me. I feel I should mention he said he was willing to drive to me but I can tell that’s not something he really wants to do and he’d prefer for me to come to him. Every time we have talked about making plans it always consists of me driving to him. I also have a puppy which makes me up and leaving my home to stay with him even more difficult. I refuse to leave my dog with my mother who already has two dogs of her own. He is my responsibility and that is not fair to her or my puppy who misses me when I am gone. Anyways, he has been getting really upset with the fact that I am at my new home unpacking and don’t really have the time nor money to drive an hour back and fourth whenever he wants. The past couple days he has been moving things especially fast. Today, he was once again getting angry at me because I haven’t been able to make solid plans with him. I understand how it can be frustrating but cmon, we hung out twice in a week and that’s already a lot considering the amount I have on my plate right now. So I figured it was time to mention my plans of joining the Air Force later this year since he is already barely able to handle me being one hour away. He lost his shit. He started out by telling me the military is terrible and that I’m going to ruin my life. He was downright rude and not supportive whatsoever. Which happens to be the reason I am not so open about my plans to join, I have gotten responses like this from multiple people so decided it was best to keep to myself. Then, he started becoming sad. He said he was “starting to fall in love with me” (less than a month after we met) and tried (still is trying) to convince me to change my career plans. He’s being totally and completely unrealistic. He’s already expecting me to prioritize him over my move and my dog and now he wants me to change what I do with my life? Now, obviously he’s in the wrong (at least I think he is) for being that way towards me. But, my question is am I the asshole for waiting nearly a month to tell him my plans? Should I have told him sooner? According to him, that’s something you should mention on the first date. I’m young, I’m dumb, I have only been in one serious relationship before. I admittedly don’t know what’s right and what’s wrong in certain relationship situations. 

TL;DR less than a month and two dates later, I finally told a guy my plans to join the military. He’s mad I waited so long."	Not the A-hole	1	0
bx7s06	2019-06-05 20:53:30		WIBTA if I didn’t visit my dying mother because my husband is in the hospital?	"This is the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make.

My husband has been in and out of the hospital for months. Without going into specifics, he can’t work, can’t help around the house, and he needs my assistance on a daily basis due to his medical issues. His condition is very serious and too much physical exertion can send him back into the hospital very quickly. Luckily, my work has been very understanding. 

My mother has been sick for a while and she isn’t expected to live much longer. My siblings have informed me that I need to come and spend time with her (in another country) before she passes. Unfortunately, my husband just went back into the hospital and I’ve been staying with him as much as I can.

Due to my husband’s condition, I’ve decided that I will have to let my mother go without saying goodbye."		1	0

In that time it hasn't gone so well and she was very rude to me today out of the blue telling me she doesn't care, wouldn't pick up the phone if I called. She's been really hot and cold with me and hasn't made me feel myself. Nothing really brought this on and it's massively affected my mental health and I want to end the friendship. 

When we were together she was a partner on my gym pass for my school. She's had access to this since we broke up. Today I decided after she made it clear she no longer wanted to talk or engage with me anymore to cancel her pass that is under my name. 

I'm now feeling lots of guilt for this decision and feel it was quite vindictive of me. Whilst she hasn't been kind recently I feel it was very nasty and now really regret it.

bx7r8t	2019-06-05 20:51:50	throwaway61554042	AITA for taking a picture of a Target underwear model at the store?	"I was at Target shopping with my sister and went by the women's clothing section. Obviously I'm not interested in the products in that section but there was a pic on the wall of a pretty stunning model, the underwear was pretty standard but she still had an amazing figure, hair and long legs all visible perfectly. So I pulled out my phone and snapped a pic.

My sister then caught up to me and asked why I was in this section. Sheepishly i admitted the truth and just stopped by to snap a photo. She seemed to get a bit angry. I asked what the big deal is, the woman is a model and the pic is already public, she talked about how it still wasn't a sexual context and I was doing that in a perverted way. We basically both realized it was an awkward convo to have in the middle of Target. On the drive back she asked if I was going to delete the pic. I did...not telling her it had already been backed up to my cloud.

I \[f18\] currently am living in a dorm with another girl \[f19\] who has incredibly bad manners such as constantly burping, spitting, yelling, chewing with her mouth open, etc. She is also incapable of understanding noise levels at sensitive hours. I tend to go to bed pretty early, and she stays up pretty late, so most nights, I find myself constantly waking up to her banging around the room. I didn't mind at first, but now every time I'm around her, I can't help but get all wound up about it. I want to just flat out tell her to SHUT UP, but I feel like it is not my place. I know these aren't terrible things to do, but when it is all I listen to when I am in my personal space, it really irks me. Did I forget to mention that she hocks up loogies multiple times a day into our trashcan? You know, the awful and terribly loud retching sound? Yeah, I can't stand that. I don't understand how she thinks that is an acceptable thing to do when sharing a space with somebody. Anyway, I'm at the end of my rope on this as I have been trying to do homework for the last hour while listening to her loudly and disgustingly eat.	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx7qg1	2019-06-05 20:50:05		AITA for thinking my aunt is unreasonable?	"I'm 18 years old and live with my aunt and uncle (I have always done so).

I have been incredibly busy for the last month, and when I got home at 11 PM tonight (I was at a friends' house) my mom had something to tell me.

She started a rant about how I forgot to put my plate in the dishwasher and how I never put my bike into the shed when I come home. This lasted for about 10 minutes, with me trying to defend myself by saying I was exhausted from doing extra shifts, school and volunteering, I just forgot and I just want to go up to my room and do nothing before I'm going to bed. She wouldnt't have it, and tried to make me ""understand"" how it's important to always put in your plates etc.

Now I totally understand this, but I honestly just forgot to do it and that's what I told her. She told me that she's tried to teach me this (to put my plates in, put bike into shed etc..) for my entire life and I should start getting it soon. I told her, if she's told me so many times and I still don't do it, then maybe she should change her strategy. She then started ranting about how her work makes her stressed (as a rebuttal to my similar excuse) and how it makes her so tired that the kids can't help with basic chores (which, 90% of the time, I do just like she wants me to).

So my viewpoint is that she is being totally unfair, and that forgetting to do ""basic chores"" every once in a while is not an offense at all and should not lead to a ""talking to"". Am I the asshole for thinking this?"	Asshole	1	0

bx7q2l	2019-06-05 20:49:12	alehansolo21	WIBTA if I told my uncle to tell his son to grow up?	"Me (21M) and my little cousin (11M) have had a pretty close relationship ever since he was really young. He only has sisters on his side, so I was always the other male family member he always wanted to be around whenever I was present. He really looks up to me, and since I'm an only child, I've really enjoyed being like a big brother to him, and I genuinely love him and having him around.

The thing that concerns me though is how he behaves for his age. The two main things that concern me are 1. he still refers to both of his parents as ma-ma and da-da (pronounced like they are two words each, if that makes sense) and 2. he's an extremely picky eater (like only, and i mean only, eats two foods and drinks white milk).

I've noticed these things for a while now, but I've never said anything because I've assumed he would grow out of it, but he hasn't, and I'm concerned his parents just aren't encouraging it at all. He's going to be starting middle school next year, and knowing how boys that age tend to treat their peers, I'm afraid that he's going to get mocked and bullied. But even beside that, I feel that at this point in his development he should be past the baby talk and starting to try new things at least.

So WIBTA if I talked to my uncle (he's my blood relative, me and his wife aren't close at all) and told him that he needs to start working towards having his son act more mature and age-appropriate? I've never talked to him about something as serious as his parenting style, but I feel like now it needs addressing? WIBTA for doing this?"	Asshole	0	0
bx7ond	2019-06-05 20:45:57		AITA for wanting to leave my *middle school band* because of someone being toxic?	"The band is not the school band, it’s a band my friends and I made. This happened a few months ago and I can’t decide if I’m the asshole or not. 

My friend and I wanted to make a band, so we did, and invited a few people to play. It was great at first. We were practicing a lot and it was good fun. We were doing songs by the band Queen, because we all liked that band. He wanted to do other songs though, and not songs the band wanted and started assigning people what to do, even though we wanted to do different things. When we didn’t want to, he started going on and on about how a was the leader, when we BOTH made the band, so if anything I was equal to him. The arguing wasn’t too bad, so we still played, a little a annoyed, but whatever. Then he wanted me and another person to clap for a song (forgot what, I think it was “This little thing called love” or something like that). As in everyone else played an instrument, and we clapped. Now this guy and his brother, also in the band, didn’t like this. But I tried to stay neutral, as this guy was my first friend ever, and my then best one. He then proceeded to make a new band without them. He pressured me into it, so I said yes, not wanting to be a bad friend. I then realized for once what he’d been doing. I’m pretty sure he has a superiority complex, because earlier that month he said he was a physically better person that me for having money and being fit (we’re both fat). I then told him I was done, as my friend he wanted  to stay did as well. He sent us messages on Snapchat about how we made a “...big mistake,” and the next day even came by to tell me that I betrayed him and we couldn’t be friends anymore. I laughed in his face and closed the door. My friends agree he’s in the wrong, but I don’t know, that’s what I need to figure out. People of Reddit, Am I The Asshole?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bx7n99	2019-06-05 20:42:49	lollipop4735	AITA for wanting to exclude my friend?	So the past couple of months have been pretty good. For the first time in my life I had friends who I would consistently see on weekends and stuff. And then I had this other friend. We have been friends for a while but a part of me always didn’t like something about him. I just treated him in my mind as a placeholder for better friends that would come in the future. I never really talked to him outside of school because of this. And now guess what, he became friends with my new friends. And he’s dating one of them. Like why? We’re high schoolers, why do we have to make commitments like that? I’m hoping it all falls apart soon but the girl is so nice and forgiving and I don’t there’s a way even he can upset her. So one time they invited him along with the normal group of people. So I had to modify my personality because he was around. I couldn’t be myself. It’s a subtle modification that i don’t think anyone would able to notice but I can feel the difference. I just don’t want him involved at all. And whenever they’re around, he’s around. And these friends made me feel special, like no other people (other than family) has. So it made me sad to see them treat him similarly. Do I just have to learn that I’m not special? Have I been judging my friend too much? And why have I had this secret resentment for him this whole time?	Asshole	0	0

Her monthly pay is around £1900 And household bills including mortgage and her car is £1200. I earn £360 a month in a shop in our village, can't drive for medical reason and public transport is piss poor. I pay for my own phone bill, Spotify, gym membership and pet insurance (don't want anything bad happening to the family pets) which  amounts to £85 monthly so I have left over money. 

My problem is mum spends £600 minimum on beers and cigarettes monthly so I don't want to pay rent to fuel this further. She wants £250 for household bills which leaves me with £25 a month to travel to see my boyfriend. 

AITA if I don't pay rent as I know it'll be spent on beers and cigs and not on any extra food for me or my brother (19)?

bx7jze	2019-06-05 20:35:14		AITA for working about my mental health?	"So ive been talking to this girls for months started with me liking her but turned in to me just being friends. I quickly got the idea that she needed help  and as i talked with her more i realized that she struggled with motivation. So i started to help her in every way i could. i would encourage her to do the work needed even making deals with small bribes of stuff like food to give her  some motivation to do the work. My whole goal was to be the person i wish i had when i went through a time very similar to hers. 

Time goes on and we are still talking and are very close. I am comfortable telling her stuff id never tell anyone else and same for her. I have been and currently am going through a really hard time with family school ap tests and getting a job and my actions start to show a bit. We can both be very rude to each other at some points in time like siblings and one of these times for me happened over snapchat where i was doing something she didnt want me to do (doesnt matter what i should not have done it, it was rude on my part I accept that). She ended up blocking me on snap. The next few days are weird she talks to me like normal we goof around but a few days after being blocked i asked if i was gonna be unblocked. I didn't care either way but this on the fence thing was stressing me out. She proceeded to say “Ill unblock u in 2 days” to which I say ok and somehow later i annoy her and she says “woop thats another day blocked”. And this causes more stress and makes me feel like shes playing a game with me and i feel like its really rude more than a joke. 

A few days later i'm still blocked life is still shiting on me and my stress is controlling me. when someone is on the fence and will talk to me at school like nothing is wrong but ignore you with any other types of communication where I wasnt blocked, it causes me a lot of stress. This would have been fine if i was my normal self but like i said a lot i wasn't in a good place in fact quite the opposite and i couldnt deal with this unease any longer. I write a paragraph of feelings asking for her to make a choice. I needed her to either unblock me and continue being friends and work out our problems, or leave me blocked and we can continue our separate ways cause the stress was consuming me and i just couldnt take it anymore. Long story short she says she isnt unblocking me, she doesnt plan on talking to me and she doesnt want my help anymore. I move on and a few days later i get word from a good friend that shes talking crap about me. It bothers me a bit but i'm respecting what she wants and leaving her alone. While her choice makes me really sad that our friendship ended this way my stress level has lowered a lot.  However i'm left wondering aita? I feel justifidied in my actions but there is part of me which makes me think i'm the asshole and that maybe I wasnt in the right.

bx7j9b	2019-06-05 20:33:34		AITA For Intentionally Reducing My Efficiency at my Workplace?	Hello Reddit, I'm a student researcher who used to be super proud of my work. I had a lot of pride (internally) over the fact that I know I work at an efficiency of about twice as fast and equal in quality to my teammates. I was really happy to be the person people asked questions too, but I never went over the heads of my leaders who I respect. Recently, my leaders promoted two of my teammates to be leaders as well.. and I was really disappointed. It's not \*just\* that I wasn't chosen. It was also who they chose. They chose a guy who was absent most of the time and hardly participated. (The other person they chose is a pretty good dude and will do a good job). I was let down. At this time, they also stopped including me in meetings and forgetting to include me in group activities. This doesn't feel nice. I wondered if I had done something, but from who I've asked nothings changed. The only reality is my political affiliation is pretty different than everyone else... but I don't hit everyone over the head with it. So feeling disillusioned and sad I have decided to reduce how much I get done to the rate of everyone else. (Can be measured because we have progress trackers and the like) Lately, leaders have been running around with their heads cut off about not  meeting deadlines (not gigantic consequences for them or me.. it just doesn't look good to them). This is obviously my fault. Am I an asshole?		1	0

I am a contractor working at a hospital. My wife and I wanted to take the opportunity to travel so I put in an application to another state. My contracting company approved and set a date in which I would start my new job (this was back in January). 

Recently we got the horrible news that ""due to a significant decrease in staffing"", they could not afford to lose me at my current job and needed me to stay here. Well given my wife and I were unaware of my application having the potential to be cancelled, we signed a lease, and paid a security deposit in this other state. 

Legally the landlord must let us off the lease given the current circumstance which he has since acknowledged. 

I have made brief contact with the landlord and he essentially said that he would return the security deposit in full, and send us the lease termination document in the next few days which is great!

Currently our lease in our apartment is due to expire and they will not allow us renew because they are renovating all vacated units. It has been a week since this brief conversation with the landlord in the other state. I texted him 2 days ago saying that we needed the security deposit back sooner than later so that my wife and I can start looking for other places to live and not struggle financially. He has not responded at all.

My wife and I are getting increasingly worried that this guys is ""ghosting"" us. We dont want to take legal action as of right now because our plates are pretty full as is. 

So WIBTA if I gave him a call, or shot him a follow up text asking about the deposit and termination paperwork? If im NTA, does anyone have any suggestions as to what I could say to this guy that wont make seem like a pestering asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So I recently bought a new couch for our common room, it’s awesome but the only downside to it is that my dog can no longer look out the window, which is her favorite past time. I work from home during the day and without her window she has become quite bored and seeks me out every few minutes. 

To remedy this, I bought her a ottoman for her to sit on near the window - after getting the approval of my roommates and clarifying I would be buying it for her (it’s a huge room so space isn’t an issue), they had no problem. In total now the room has two L shaped sectionals (one of roommates, one of mine), the ottoman, and my roommates desk. 

He recently has decided to work from home too- however every day he sits at his desk with his feet up on the ottoman so the dog can no longer look out the window. there is also a sofa right next to his desk so he could put his feet on that one. I would really like to ask him to please make room for her to sit there, but I feel like I would be an asshole for asking that. He’s also very confrontational and I don’t want to make it a bigger issue than it is. There are other places to put his feet but not other places for my dog to sit and be occupied by the window. I know it’s not a big deal, but I did buy that ottoman for her and specified that was why I bought it.

bx7eow	2019-06-05 20:23:13	BananaTea28	WIBTA if I didn't get anything​ for my sisters 18th and become more selfish​?	"Ok, so I am the eldest and growing up, my parents weren’t into giving gifts and parties etc so I did missed out a bit - all my friends got things and I never did, it was so awkward.

So, since I started earning my own money on a crap weekend student job, I spend a lot on my siblings/parents in different things.  But since my siblings are younger and don’t work, I don’t expect much back.

When it is their birthdays, I buy NICE things for them e.g. for my sisters last birthday, I got her a Ted Baker watch and gave 50 pounds. 

For my birthday, I got nothing… as usual from my parents and siblings. Not even a cake, lol. I have never had someone get me a cake. I mean, they could have at least got me a card - A CARD. I don’t care what they get me, it’s the sentiment of it. 

Truth be told, one of my sisters asked my mum what to get me, and said she found it difficult as I have everything (paid for by myself). But even then, saying/asking is different to actually doing something - I would be happy with a bag of sweets! 

Would I be an asshole if I got them nothing from now on and in doing so, expect money back? I give them a lot of things for free. 

For example, it is my sisters 18th this month and I plan on getting nothing for her. I actually told her this because of the following situation: she won a gift card at school, that she gave to my brother for his birthday, despite him never getting her anything??? 

Again, it’s the sentiment of it. I always make a fuss for everyone and I just feel ignored all the time. I am only there when they need educated advise or so forth. 

My sister needs to go to a job interview this Friday so I am adjusting my plans to now do this when I really don’t want to - I am going to be selfish. My sisters and I share a room, and I kid you not, they have taken the bin out ONCE and always bring that up and NEVER clean up.

bx7bs8	2019-06-05 20:16:23	olia22	AITA for leaving a friend behind while a teacher was yelling at us?	"AITA?

&#x200B;

So basically what happened was; we were at lunch and for the past few days we've been yelling stupid shit like ""White males are oppressed."" So today my friend yelled it a little louder than normal and a few kids came over to his lunch table (my friend was at a different table than us) and started yelling at him. So then this girl comes over to my lunch table and starts cussing us out. She calls us misogynistic and racist. (I have no clue where the misogyny came from, we never mentioned women at all.) So one of my other friends starts firing back and asks her to leave us alone and mind her own business and shit. So then this girl gets up in my friend's face and is trying to fight her and it's funny because my friend is a solid four inches taller than this girl. That's when the AIDES see what was going on. The girl starts yelling at the AIDES and telling them stuff that didn't happen. The AIDES kind of ignore her so she just leaves which leaves me and my friends to be yelled at. So while all of this is going on the first bell has already gone off so we might be late for our next period.

The AIDES ask us what happened and they're kind of angry because every teacher but one wasn't white. So here we are, yelling about white males being oppressed and the largest minority ever comes over. They basically ask who was the one yelling, and my friend owned up to it, and we definitely tried to stand up for him saying it was just a joke and we didn't actually think white males were oppressed. But the AIDES weren't really listening to us and they kept yelling at my friend. 

Eventually, they let my table go, but the friend who was yelling had to stay back. I know I was told to go but I feel bad leaving my friend behind. I saw him after school got out and he didn't seem angry or anything. I just feel bad. 

&#x200B;

Rundown if you're too lazy to read: my friend yells offensive joke, random girl gets annoyed and attracts teachers by yelling at us, friend who was yelling was forced to stay back while everyone else was allowed to leave, I feel like a bad person for leaving him."	Asshole	0	0

bx7aix	2019-06-05 20:13:39	GOIwithBennettFoddy	AITA for not clarifying the truth that may get me fired to my employer?	"I'm 23, and I just got a job at a large tech company that pays really good money. But, I'm unqualified for it. 

I never graduated college, I did attend for a while, but I had to drop out due to lack of funds and unfortunate circumstances. The job qualifications say a bachelor's is required, and I didn't lie about it on my resume, or during the interview. They didn't ask to see my diploma either, and during the interview, it was just sort of...glazed over after one question. A few days later I found out I got the job. It's been over a month now, and I'm slowly realizing that I'm the youngest one in my office, and because of a lack of a degree, I'm probably under-qualified. 


**I'm afraid that after working here for a while, if the possibility of a promotion or I'm asked to interview for a higher position, that they'll find out I never actually graduated and that it may get me fired, or I'll be passed up. Am I the Asshole for not clarifying the truth to my employer if it means I may be passed up or fired?**


That's basically it, below is just a further explanation. 
(I'll elaborate on this further down, I just want to state my problem here.)


*me being interviewed*

My boss: You go to the university of texas? 

Me: No, I went there. 

Her: Well I see you majored in government, why do you want to work in this field?

... And that was pretty much it, aside from that. Working with her, she's asked me a couple of questions about college, like how I liked it, but nothing like she's trying to see if I lied about it. She's in the process of getting her Masters, and I'm just sitting there like ""oh she thinks I graduated. I hope that won't get me in trouble later..."""	No A-holes here	0	0

bx7a6h	2019-06-05 20:12:50	Listinbish	AITA for getting annoyed that my friends wouldn’t spot be a beer?	"So my friends and I used to go to a small school, but one of the big ten party schools was not too far away—just over an hour drive—so we would drive out there pretty frequently. I always drove. Now, I don’t mind that I drove at all. When me and friend A started going out to the school, I was the one with a car so I had to drive. The next year when friend B started coming too, she had a car but I still didn’t mind driving cause I was already familiar with the route.

Anyways, like I said, the drive is just over an hour. I have a smaller car so each round trip probably takes about a half tank of gas. I’ve always thought making the trips out there was fun so I never really asked for gas money. I didn’t mind making the drive/spending the gas money for the good time.

About the 20th time we visit out there though, I was a little strapped for cash. While we were at a campus bar, my friends were going to get a drink while I was playing pool. So I asked them if they would mind grabbing me a beer while they were up there. When they asked me to give them money for it, I asked if they could just spot me as I didn’t have anymore cash on me. But, as you can tell from the title, they refused.

This got me kind of annoyed. I kind of “jokingly” mentioned how I always spend my gas money to drive them there and it would be nice if they could help me out. (I was trying not to be too pushy or aggressive, but talking in a “hopefully they’ll get the point” of way). Friend B started pushing back to that saying she’s had her own car longer than me and always pay for her own gas. I told her yeah, but you never drive me around anywhere, let alone halfway across the state every other weekend, sooo apples and oranges.

I don’t want to be that person who does something nice for someone and then feels like they’re obligated to repay me. I also don’t want to seem like I’m entitled to free things for driving people places. But I don’t see why after 20 free trips out to this school they couldn’t just spot me a beer. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: I drove my friends out to a party school an hour away numerous times and never asked for gas money. When I asked them to spot me a beer one time they refused and I thought it was kinda petty given that we were only out there cause I always drive them.

EDIT: in case there is any concern. We were staying at a friend’s apartment that night—parked there and walked to every bar and back—drove back home the next day. So no worries about any drinking and driving!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I have food poisoning, not doctor worthy, I have spent three hours vomiting and I just want to get some sleep.

My husband wants me to sleep on the couch so he isn't kept awake by this.  My counter is that I'm sick and if one of us sleeps on the couch it should be him.

bx79qj	2019-06-05 20:11:42	bleyer	AITA for wanting my girlfriend to sign up for Global Entry?	"Hi everyone, and thanks for taking the time.

My girlfriend loves to travel, and has spent much of her life traveling all over the world. We have a wonderful relationship, and after two years of dating have recently begun doing some traveling together. In nearly every respect she is a perfect travel companion, but despite all the traveling she's done and wishes to do together, she absolutely refuses to sign up for  TSA Pre-Check or Global Entry (an international version of TSA Pre-Check) as she disagrees with the core of idea of the system itself.

I've been a Global Entry member for a few years now, and it's been an incredible convenience when I travel. It's saved me hours of time when moving through airport security and Customs. While I feel it's simply an optional security measure you can complete in exchange for added convenience, she finds the whole idea of the program to be wrong as it's essentially just a way to pay the government in exchange for preferential treatment, which she idealistically disagrees with and refuses to support.

Technically she's not entirely wrong and I'm trying to understand where she's coming from, as she's not this strongly opinionated or idealistic about many other issues... but each time I try to discuss this it immediately becomes clear that she's passionate about her stance and is unwilling to budge. And while I understand there's a fee for Global Entry that perhaps not everyone can pay, I feel the $100 cost is pretty nominal in relation to the general cost of air travel, and see it as a fair rate for the additional time and labor needed to interview and process applicants. I also feel it's more than just a government bribe, as it's something you need to qualify for through additional background checks and security screenings. (But yes, I also know and accept that our American TSA protocols are incredibly ineffective and a waste of resources in general.)

I love this girl with all my heart and we have a very healthy relationship, but when we travel together this topic has become a sore-spot. I've stopped bringing it up and always end up waiting in line alongside with her through standard security check-in, as I'd never skip the line without her. She wants to continue traveling together more often, and I'm not sure whether to press this point in hopes of getting her to reconsider, or just suck it up and go through the longer wait by her side. I respect her values and can understand where she's coming from, but the system doesn't feel unfair to me and this will eventually waste much more of our time if she wants to travel more frequently together.

Is she being unreasonable about this? Or AITA for feeling she's being overly idealistic and difficult about an available convenience?

Thanks again for your time! It's sincerely appreciated!"	No A-holes here	0	0
bx79mo	2019-06-05 20:11:27	lexapro_bro	AITA for wanting to spend a couple days with my wife on a vacation where sister paid for the flight?	"Back in December, my sister, who lives in \[large west coast city\] bought my wife and I airplane tickets to go to said city, ostensibly to vacation and visit her.  We'll be there 5 full days plus 2 travel days.  Just for some context, we live in a small midwestern town and see my sister a few times a year when she visits us here.  We haven't taken a vacation outside of our state for a couple years now, and I don't take off work more than 7 days a year other than holidays, which we spend at home.  We have 2 toddlers, and my sister's family has 2 toddlers as well.  Our parents and my wife's parents will be watching our kids during the trip.

I was looking forward to some time alone with my wife, so I planned an excursion on 2 of the days to another city.  Then I discover that they've made plans on one of the days that would preclude our excursion.  Namely, we'll be hanging out with my sister's family and our mutual friends, then spending the night at a hotel for an anniversary (ours) surprise paid for by my parents.  NBD I thought, we can just do the trip on two other days.  One of those days would have to be a weekend day, which is one of two days of our trip when my hard-working brother-in-law would be available.  That's my potential asshole move I suppose.

My mom just called me to relay my sister's displeasure that I'm ""not spending any time with my sister"" on a trip that my sister is paying for.  I appreciate the gift, however I kind of resent all the strings attached.  As I see it, we're spending 3 of 5 full days with them.  Moreover, if it was up to me, I'd be spending my rare vacation time somewhere else with just my wife and I.  I like my sister, my brother-in-law, and her family, but I was hoping for some kind of balance here.  If I was being honest here too, I was also hoping to get away from toddlers for a few days (perhaps another point in the asshole column), and my sister has a couple of them.  I would hope that as a fellow parent of toddlers, she might see the appeal in that, but I guess not.  I don't consider gracing them with my presence to be a gift, and it's great that they want to see us, but I'm a little perplexed at this awkward situation.

So, am I being an ungrateful asshole?  My inclination is just to cancel the 2 day trip, shorten it to one day when my BIL is not working, and spend the other with my sister, BIL, and her one son (BIL's parents offered to watch the other child on this day, another point in the asshole column).  Not worth making this relationship strained for the next 20 years.

EDIT: After reading your responses, I called my sister and worked this out.  We're going to spend a day and an overnight somewhere closer to her house, then meet her the next morning.  That way we'll be spending both days when my BIL is available with them. Thanks for your help everyone!"	Asshole	0	0

So I’m a manager at a restaurant that can get pretty busy, filling up most if not all of the parking spaces in front of the store.

They left the car overnight and it’s still here after a day.

I’ve considered having the car towed since we do have signs posted up saying if the car isn’t here for business it has the possibility of being towed. I’ve never had to tow a car before, and we’ve had people with busted cars here before, but they’ve never parked terribly in the closest spots to the door.

I took care of landscaping, cooking breakfast, and fixing things around the house and car maintenance and she did everything else. She always complained and nagged me to do more but I felt it was even. She dared me to swap chores for a week and I agreed and figured it would be great to get a week off from some of the heavier labor.

2 days in and I was cooked with all the shit. My kids were asking for this shirt or those pants to be washed with no notice, I had to manage where everyone was going and what needed to get done, and my wife didn’t let me get away with any “slacking” like ordering food in or letting dishes sit in the sink. 

After 2 days I admitted I was wrong and asked her to help, but she declined and told me we agreed to a week and she earned the time off. She wouldn’t help with anything. She just hug out with our kids while I cooked and cleaned and made sure their lives were in order. When it ended, I told her I understood her point but I was furious with her for abandoning me and leaving that work on me when she knew t wasn’t fair.

bx743i	2019-06-05 19:58:53	_barista_	AITA for asking out the cute barista I see every morning after I found out her age?	"I go to the same cafe most mornings, and for the past week, I’ve been getting served by the same girl. She was cute and kinda endearing, but her age was definitely on the ambiguous side and I didn’t want to come off as a creep. 

&#x200B;

Well I went to go get a drink with a very good friend of mine Ryan and I was chatting up the same barista Lindsey. Lindsey mentioned she just graduated a couple weeks ago and is just working here for the summer. So I asked if she was 18 then and she replied yes, so then I proceeded to offer to take her out to dinner. She sorta giggled and said she had a boyfriend but she’s flattered. As far as rejections go, it was pretty graceful.

&#x200B;

Well Ryan later came up to me and said the people in line were making fun of my because “I was an old creep hitting on a high schooler”. For reference, I’m 29, but I have a full beard and powerlifted in college; people often mistaken me to be in my upper 30s - mid 40s. I told him he should’ve sticked up for me and he said “nah man I was agreeing with them; it was pretty embarrassing for him to be with me in public when I’m hitting on high schoolers.” I maintained that she was well above legal (16 is the age of consent in my state), AND she was an adult; people need to mind their own business. He said “well hit on teenagers on my own time but don’t do it in public with me anymore. I was going to say something back but I just dropped the subject.

&#x200B;

I think Ryan’s overreacting and is being sensitive to normal human interaction. She’s been nice and flirty with me since I started seeing her, so I wanted to shoot my shot. Am I really TA for asking her out?"	Asshole	0	0

"So this took place back when avengers endgame came out.  so i joined a flat earth discord server to debate about flat vs round earth (duh) this is  something i love debating about since i take physics and like debunking the   
""Science"" behind flat earth(also i used to be a flat earther i know, i was stupid but that fact is remember that now) . one of the people that stood out there, lets call him mario. and he was a flat brainer obviously. also he had quite a lot of permissions there(banning, muting etc)

i occasionally chat in that server and one day i read this convo:

random guy: Earth is round

mario: round as a coin?

and then i went out like a badass:

me: round as my ass

basically he muted me(i got unmuted later). and i (keep in mind i love debating this topic) started DM'ing him, not demanding to be unmuted but just to debate. i said i used to be a flat earther and we started debating over it. kind of. it was more like me debating and mario just not answering my questions deliberately. kind of like avoiding my points and bs'ing. eventually he either got sick of me or frustrated, because he pulled a classic flat earther move by blocking me:

mario: ok, but do you trust NASA?

me: honestly dont care what NASA says (i really dont. earth was proven round way before copernicus even)

mario: can you agree?

me: well sure i guess. maybe i am ok with NASA

mario: ah i see, so you were lying then, fuck off liar (clarification: he thinks im lying about being an ex-flat earther)

\*blocks me\*

then the story resumes a few weeks later, im back on the server and debating with 2 other dudes. mario joins in and the three of them proceed to join me in a 3v1 debate, nothing bad or anything. eventually, i find that ive been banned by mario himself. i eventually got a moderator to unban me shortly after and mario bans me again.he blocked me on my main discord account so i used my 2nd one.

me: hey man you cant just be banning me for no reason

mario: meh i dont like liars much

literally his reason for banning me. keep in mind the ""liar"" stuff was all on dms. he has literally no reason to ban me.

basically we just started getting pissed and whatnot. eventually it kinda pissed me off that he thought i was a liar and was triggered over it. later that day me and my friends watched endgame and i came back home. since he was banning me for no reason and accusing me of lying i decided to return the favour cuz i wasnt gonna take shit from someone accusing me. i pretty much spoiled ALL of endgame. he replied and called me a f\*g and we just started talking shit until he blocked me again. i didnt think too much about it at the time, but now its really bugging me, AITA?

My friend is really mad because my kids are always eating his food which they're kids, and i cant stop them. he's mad that im late on rent this month because it was a harder month then normal.

im constantly taking him to work because he cant drive. This takes time out of my day every day to take him to work and it is annoying that he asks a lot. 

He told me I need to find another place to rent because he is tired of dealing with my stuff in the living room and he is tired of having to pay for me! But I pay for food, I pay for him to get to work, I pay for hulu and netflix. I even pay the electric bill. He hates my pet rabbits, and constantly tells me to get rid of them. He is consistently mad and coming home very annoyed with me. He flaked out on a vacation we were to take, and left me to pay the entire bill. 

He is a hermit. He's always in his room alone. im constantly trying to get him to interact with my friends. he stays alone and only comes out to yell that something is missing, or something got moved. Today he shut off the internet, so i cant watch anything. my kids are home from school and we cant do anything without the internet as well.

Just the other day he had someone over and I had my gun out because the person looked like he would steal my shit. He got mad at me for having a gun. I'm not getting rid of my gun. He consistently bitches that I have people over but I'm fine with him having people over. He has a friend that comes over almost every night and that leaves in the middle of the night. I don't know if he's stealing my shit or not. The only people I have over is family and a few friends.

He says I need to buy him more yogurt and soda since my kids are always eating it. But I never seen them eat it and I tell them not to. But they're kids if they sneak something I can't stop them.

So I (26M) have a brother (24) who I have a good relationship with. We live in the same town and I usually see him every week.  The problem is that he lies to my families faces about certain things. In particular about his schooling/jobs.  

My parents pay for all his expenses, including buying him a house. He is married and has ""worked"" on and off for years. (More on that later) Over time my wife, my other brother (28), his wife, and close friends have all figured out he is lying. There are SO many pieces of evidence (all circumstantial Ill admit) pointing to lying. I'll give some examples. 1)  he says he graduated with a 2-year degree after 5 years but no one has ever seen his dilpoma including his wife. 2) he goes out of his way to tell everyone about ridiculous job related stories and it always feels forced 3) he is always available when he was supposed to be working 4) one time he sent my other brother, my dad and I a screenshot of an email. It was supposed to be a notification saying his position is no longer needed and they sent it the day before he was supposed to start. The problem was his screenshot showed that it was sent from HIS email address to HIS email address. I still dont understand why he felt he needed to send a painfully obvious fake email. There are many more examples.

The biggest problems I have are that our Mom eats all of his damn stories right up. My dad doesn't say anything because he doesn't want to upset her. He manipulates them into spending their savings on his expenses.  More than that, he is supposed to be my brother and quite frankly one of my best friends and he lies to my face.  This causes large amounts of stress on both my wife and I.  Lastly, he rushed into having a baby (due in 4 months) and I believe he has never had a real job. Unless he gets a job for real, all the financial burden will fall on our parents.

I know outing him will destroy my relationship with him, upset my mom, and probably change our family's dynamic forever.  I can't just go to him either. He is the type of person that will immediately get defensive and pissed, start spinning more lies, and trash talk me to my family.

bx70wm	2019-06-05 19:51:37	croptopmonster	AITA for hanging out with friends during a funeral trip?	"This happened a few years ago, forgive me if I forget small details.

I had just moved kinda far away for college, didn't know anyone there and was lonely/homesick. Found out a family member died so I had to fly back home for several days for the funeral. 

Our whole family would go to funeral events and hang out together during the day. At night, my sister and most of my cousins would go out to bars together. I wasn't old enough to go with them. I was tired of being sad staying home alone at night, so I decided to go hang out with my friends to get my mind off things.

Apparently they left the bar earlier than expected and my sister called me while I was out. She was very upset (most likely drunk) and angry that I wasn't home. I told her I was hanging out with my friends for a while and would be home later. She got pissed that I wasn't there to support her when she's sad. I said she got to be with people at night when she was sad and I'm just doing the same thing. She said it's different because that's family, you shouldn't prioritize friends over family during a funeral. At this point we were yelling at each other. I said I just wanted one night to take my mind off things just like everyone else got to, she said I'm a selfish asshole and that I was just using this trip as an excuse to hang out with my high school friends. 

We're obviously past this now, but I'm curious to see if other people agree with her. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Will I be the asshole for not letting my friend come with my dad and I to play mini golf? While on vacation in Hilton Head Island, my dad and I have a tradition where one morning we will go to a pancake place called Stacks and after we finish eating, we will play a round of mini golf at Pirates Adventure. This started out 4 years ago when my dad took me to Stacks and he spontaneously asked me if I wanted to play mini golf when he saw Pirates Adventure was open, I agreed and it become a tradition that we have been doing ever since. Now back to the story.

This year, my friends mother, who is really nice, asked if her youngest son could join us to play mini golf when we go at the end of the week. I am good friends with her youngest but my brain was telling me to say no because playing mini golf has always been a thing I only did with my dad on vacation and it wanted to keep it that way.

Backround: So....I'm in the equivalent of hs and my class is supposed to be the ""nerdy class"". Key word is **supposed.** Half of my class works or do as any student (so i have no problem with them), the other half.....not so much. They talk a shit ton, like to the point where some teachers have told us we are the worse class they've had. On top of that, they do all of their hw last minute (for example: every week ~~they do their physics hw~~  they copy the hw during the break before physics). I've complained to my friends and family about them. Don't hate them, hate what they're doing.

&#x200B;

So a few weeks ago, we were in english and we were doing a test. (sometimes we can get out of the class early to not disturb anyone) Assuming we could, one of them left, the teacher got a bit mad but said we could leave but we must be back by at x time. So naturally i leave bc there's nothing wrong with that, right? So there we are, 90% of the class waiting for the end of the class. Kid comes in tells us to come in. My friends and I go back with him bc there was 1 min left, everyone else stayed. Girls followed but didnt enter, but they had good intensions ( this is important for later). Teach is logically mad bc its my friends, some other friends who stayed and I. we work just us to see if they come (10 min). She goes looking for them, finds the girls waiting, gets mad at them (the girls are in the right in my opinion). Rest of them get back to class after she go gets them. Teach is fuming, you can see is furious. She starts ranting. The innocent almost get punnished bc she was going to hold us in but it was lunch. Instead she gave those who were late and the girls  some tardies.

Fast foward to friday where our ""homeroom teacher"" (for lack of a better term). HomeTeach see's half the class has a tardy. They lie and say that they were with the girls. Waiting with them. I didnt object or anything. Im supposed to be with this class for another 2 years, i dont want to be known as the snitch.

Would i have been the asshole if i said anything? If i do should i ask to stay anonymous?

So, my BIL is a young man that has 0 aspirations in life. He dropped out of high school since he was 16 and now he works at some local coffee shop not sure how many hours. His parents live 2 hours away from where he wants to live so he basically crashes at a different house every single day. My BIL has crashed into our apartment a few times and the last time he went to our one bedroom apartment left me with a bad taste in my mouth because he did not text us when he was going to be there and he ended up showing up around 12 AM. I told my husband that I did not want BIL in our apartment again because he showed up unannounced, super late, and I found a weird bug on our couch. 

One week later (yesterday), my husband checked Snapchat and saw that BIL was sleeping at a Walmart parking lot. Few hours pass by and BIL texts my husband if he can sleep at our apartment tonight. I felt really bad because he was sleeping at a parking lot so I said sure let’s help him. I also went out of my way and made food for him because he’s vegan and I always want my guests to be attended as best as possible. A few hours pass and we get no reply. Husband texted him at 6PM and then again at 11PM. We thought that he was working late until we checked Snapchat and found out that he was out partying. And guess what? He never responded to my husband’s texts and stood us up. We had the sheets, towel, and food ready and we did not get one single text that he’s not coming anymore. 

He texted this morning that he was going to get his guitar from our apartment since he left it at one of his previous visits. He has not apologized, he did not even acknowledge that he left us on read and stood us up. My husband says that if he changes, that we should help him again but I believe it’s not our problem to help him after the past two incidents. I have been raised to help anyone that is in need but I feel very mistreated. I would have given him another chance in the future but the fact that he has not apologized makes me never want to help him again.

TLDR: BIL is basically homeless and asked to stay in our one bedroom apartment and stood us up and has not apologized yet."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx6vnj	2019-06-05 19:39:34		AITA for issuing a final warning to an employee who was in a car accident?	"I work work a small company ~20 employees. I have 4 direct report employees. About 3 months ago one of my guys came to work and I noticed that his car had a halfway flat tire and I mentioned it to him. I see the next day it’s basically the same I mention it to him again. This goes on for a week and a half and he eventually fills the tire. 

About 4 weeks ago I noticed it was getting low again, and I bring it up to him. I tell him that he can take it the Les Schwab to get it fixed, there is one about 3 blocks from our office. I offer to meet him there just before our shift and I can drop him off after our shift and he can pick it up. He says he will deal with it later, I let him know they will fix these things for free just Incase his reluctance is money related. He passes. The next day the tire is inflated fully again.  Last Monday I see it’s low again. I don’t mention it because I always get the same song and dance. 

For the most part he is a great employee reliable for the most part doesn’t call in sick often. However he was pretty ill in January and used up all his sick time plus a couple days for the year. I gave him a verbal warning at that point that he doesn’t have any left, and that if he needs to call out I’ll have to write him up. He called out once in May (the way before Memorial Day...) and I gave him a written warning.

Monday morning on his way to work he gets a blow out and totals his car, it went into the the center and rolled over onto its roof. He is okay mostly, big cut on his face and just hurting all over from the wreck. He came in today after being out Monday and Tuesday, to a Final warning. He is really upset with me. He is asking for an exception, totaled his car, excuses and such. I feel like I’m being an asshole, but given that I have had many conversations with him about the state of his vehicle, I can’t offer him a pass on this. One of the other department heads who I work with says I should let this one slide.

bx6rsj	2019-06-05 19:30:35	tossmetothewind00	AITA for asking my mom to cut down contact with her dad & stepmom?	"My \[17F\] mom \[52F\] suffers from severe bipolar disorder. Last year around this time she was in a manic stage and ran off to her dad and stepmom's house, leaving a note on the dresser to my dad \[57M\] that she wants a divorce. My dad loves her a lot so we got in the car & drove to her. He was crying the whole way. I have never liked them because they were abusive my mom when she was little & they hurt me a few times but my dad always saved me before it got too bad. When we got there my dad & I were both sobbing- we didn't see this coming. We had just gotten back from a vacation & everything had been perfect. We convinced her to come back home with us. When we got home her family was constantly texting her, & she was responding & answering all calls like normal. However, they thought it was my dad texting & me on the phone, both of us pretending to be her. They thought that we had kidnapped her & were holding her hostage. They threatened to call the cops on my dad & I, & actually did once.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had never liked visiting them, & they always said something mean enough to make me cry but I always excused myself and returned with a smile after. When my mom forced my dad & I to visit them at Christmas I had a panic attack. I ended up spending about 20% of the entire visit in the bathroom trying to hold it together. I only went because my mom was making my dad go & I was afraid that her family might try to hurt him as they have a skewed view of him & had made threatening comments in the past.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mom wants to go visit them & she's taking my dad. I'm scared for my dad. I don't want there to be an ""accident"" where he gets hurt. I'll fight tooth & nail for my dad's safety. However, I'm afraid for my own mental health. Idk if I can do it again - Christmas was terrible & that was only for 2 hours. A full weekend idk if I can handle. I don't want to go off on my grandparents without them provoking me, but I'm afraid that I might because of my stress & anxiety. I was talking to my mom about this & explained to her why I don't think she should see them now or in the future. She told me I didn't need to go & I explained my fears about my dad getting hurt. I used the analogy that when a baby bear is severely hurt or threatened by another animal the mama bear goes after the animal - she doesn't get all buddy buddy with them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave her 3 choices. Me (cut down all contact with them completely), them (choose to go see them), or a middle ground: we meet them halfway for lunch & I promise I won't make a scene if they are kind. She said she can't trust them to not say something mean for 2 hours. I told her if they don't respect her & her family enough to keep from making their granddaughter cry for 2 hours then they don't deserve to see us & they definitely can't be trusted for a whole weekend.

bx6pyu	2019-06-05 19:26:20	Bunheadx	WIBTA if I told my mom to quit posting a ton of pictures of me on social media?	"My mom is very active on social media, and uses them regularly, mainly Facebook and Instagram. She has around 250 followers on Instagram, and about the same amount of friends on Facebook. She pretty much posts around 4-5 pics every time she's out with friends, her boyfriend, the family or literally doing anything. Fine, whatever. Her profile, her choice.

My problem is when I come in. I'm not trying to ruin anything for her, which is also why I've been quiet about this for so many years, but I'm very VERY anxious about my face and my body. I absolutely hate seeing pictures of myself, especially when they're taken by others, and the fact that hundreds of people can openly look at it, makes me feel even worse about it. I can barely look at the pictures sometimes, because all I see is just how fucking bad I look.

This wouldn't be such a big deal for me if it wasn't so constant, but it is. Every time we're out eating, driving together, eating breakfast, Facetiming with our distant family, or just out walking, she whips out her phone and pull me in for another selfie. If I make the slightest complain about it, she pulls the ""You're sensitive, stop complaining, it's memories. You'll be so happy about it in 10 years"" 

She also does this with my 5- and 3-year old cousins. Whenever we're at family meetings, she immediately rushes to them, says ""Shouldn't we take a little selfie, now that we're together?"", puts on her half duck-face and 2 minutes later it's posted. This bothers me. They're very small, not even her children, and she still demands that they're part of her social media-life.

I've tried talking to her about it, shortly. Explaining to her that I really don't like seeing myself all over her profiles, especially when she has so many friends and followers that I know nothing about. She just brushes it off saying it's all fine and that nobody is judging me, but I'm really not comfortable with it.

bx6pvm	2019-06-05 19:26:11	moosemtns	WIBTA for not forgiving my sister-in-law?	"Three days before my wife and I got married, my sister-in-law attacked my wife. My sister-in-law is exceedingly self centered. Very narcissistic and any gathering has ultimately always centered around her, what she wants to do, where she wants to go, etc.

In the buildup to our big day my wife, her sister, and my mother in law had numerous errands to run. All kinds of miscellaneous tasks and last minute things to handle in preparation for the wedding.

Throughout the day my sister-in-law complained, whined, and took issue with all the things they had to do. Even though she was told in advance what needed to be done and she agreed, she made it worse than it needed to be. 

Toward the end my beloved wife had enough. Her sisters attitude was making things more difficult, ruining what could have been a memorable afternoon, and was classically ""her"" by trying to do things outside of what needed to be done. 

My wife essentially told my sister-in-law she was being a bitch. This resulted in a shouting match which was left unfinished. They got home and my sister-in-law took a bottle and threw water on my wife, followed by tackling her to the ground trying to fight her. She pulled my wifes hair, and scratched the shit out of her bicep. To her credit, my wife fought back and kicked ass (proud husband).

My wife now has a scar on her arm and our wedding memories have a small cloud as a result of this behavior. My wife is speaking with her again (after a 4-5 month refusal to do so). She isn't forgiving her outright but wants to eventually do so. 

I am still astounded at this child like behavior and do not see any reason to speak with or forgive her. However I don't want to cause or contribute to a rift between family.

bx6ojh	2019-06-05 19:23:04	PeaPod117	AITA for being annoyed with my sister?	"I posted earlier ab this and realized my point got lost in the example I gave and that there were a lot of things I had to clarify and include for people to see where I was coming from ;; TDLR at bottom

So I come from a family that pushes team work. This means if one of us needs help with something, we usually do so. An example of this is when I go to work with my mom and dad, even if I finish my assigned things first I still have to go and ask my mom or dad if they need help or if there’s anything I can do.

One of my siblings doesn’t seem to grasp this concept. Anytime one of us asks her to help or to do her chores she either takes a really long time to do it or makes up an excuse as to why she can’t do it. 

The example I used in the earlier post was that I asked her this morning if she could help me with the chickens and ducks, and the two rabbits that I put out in a pen as well (I don’t usually need help with the rabbits unless one of them escapes my hands or the hutches, because I understand they’re MY responsibility. I have 5 rabbits total and 10 birds total; the birds were bought after a lot of pondering and research, with my own money. My dad and I went to buy them. Everyone usually helps to some degree, whether it be tossing feed at them or refilling water or chasing them back to the backyard. I just happen to be the main caretaker). Keep in mind that I have been doing this for a months by myself, so after a while I began getting a little overwhelmed once I started falling and hurting my ankle chasing 10 crazy birds by myself. When I asked for her help in rounding them up, she said no. I said please, and she just made another one of her excuses. I got upset and stormed out to do it myself, and one of my other siblings came and helped me with the flock after witnessing this.

Another example is when my mom asks her to do the dishes or clean her room, my sister always disappears to the bathroom for a lengthy amount of time or suddenly begins to practice her musical instrument; both of which she knows she can’t really get in trouble for. Sometimes she even goes to take a nap. Either that or she makes someone else do the work entirely. 

After all of this, even when my parents ask her to help them, she either does so very grudgingly or just makes an excuse.

I could name plenty more examples, and some of the excuses she can come up with are pretty dumb. I’ve often called her out on this and when I do she gets very upset, which tbh leads to me getting upset as well because it’s annoying when everyone else is helping each other and pulls their own weight while she’s here doing almost nothing.

"so, i'm a young teen and english is not my first language for that reason pls excuse my lack of proper english knowledge lol. this all started at her birthday party. i made her a present but it got f ed (i printed *uwu* on a shirt lol, cause i'm quirky like that) up so i had to leave it at home, but i did show her a pic bc she was so adamant about everyone giving her a present bc 'it's her birthday and she deserves it'. i felt really bad and promised to give it to her later on but im dumb and ended up forgetting about it.
and then her confirmation comes around. she's christian (i'm an atheist) and she wanted a big expensive one. where she would get a ton of money and gifts. there would have been around 50 ppl attending and i have anxiety(attacks at times, it's not fun). and she expected me to pay for the meals at the reastuant of their choice and to bring a present, which could also be money. i found this a bit weird bc her dad always expects money from like lowkey everyone. (even though they aren't bad off financially) anyways i didn't go.
the same day as her i messaged her about how it was and we got into an argument about how in her family and the way she was raised it was the 'right' thing to do to ALWAYS bring presents whether it be money or something else. i disagreed bc i was raised to appreciate the person and the intention instead of the presents. ppl come first valuebles second. she stated this was bc of her 'good' faith even though she knows my family are theiast as well. she then told me i was unreliable af, for the record i did say she was materialistic so fair enough i guess. 
the final messages were about how i'm broke and don't want to spend money on her (this offended me a bit bc my dad passed away when i was young and it took a toll on us not only financially but emotionally as well) and why does he have to have such an expensive celebration when they can't afford it themselves??!

bx6lsq	2019-06-05 19:16:36	throw9219	AITA for wanting to take the car for a boys trip.	"I (28M) planned a couple days away with some mates to go to a real nice secluded place in wales that belongs to one of my friends parents. Its just me and some of my buddies from Wednesday to Sunday.

My fiance (27F) was super cool with it just being a guys thing because she knowd I dont get out much. We been together 8 years

We were all going to drive there (roughly 5 hours)  and i was offered a lift from 2 of my mates but decided i wanted to drive myself (just easier and less stops for bathroom breaks). Problem is me and fiance share 1 car. We both paid to buy it but she pays our insurance, tax, MOT and servicing as she earns more than i do. 

She says i cant take it because she needs it for work. (i have a work van but cant use it for non work purposes). So i tell her to catch the trains to work and she moans it will add alot of time to her commute and she wont have a way to get to the train station. So i tell her to catch a bus to the train station. Again, she complains it will add more time to her journey. Felt like my solutions were just shot down without a thought.

Then i felt she tried to guilt me by saying id be leaving her house bound for the weekend.

She refused to let me have the car. I told her she was being selfish and that she knows i dont get out much. She told me to suck it up and just said no. So i dropped out of the trip because it soured my mood. 
Some of my mates tell me i should have just put my foot down and taken the car, i paid for too! but others disagree. AiTA?

Edited: i let her take the car at least once a month for the weekend so she can visit family. I dont complain, at all, i just have mates round or play games. No big deal. I dont feel its fair she complains on the rare times i want to use the car for a trip."	Asshole	0	0
bx6lqb	2019-06-05 19:16:26		AITA for being really mad at my friend for changing plans last second?	"So this is a good friend of mine. She lives across country. Many months back she told me how she was going to southeast Asia for a vacation. She was going to visit VA and then swing to see myself and other friends in NYC over a span of a few days before she left. We haven't seen each other in several years so we were looking forward to seeing each other. The plan was that she was going to come out to me on Long Island. 

Fast forward to this past Sunday, we're talking on the phone and the plan was that today she would take the train out to LI to see me (the logistics of me going to work and then going to NYC was too cumbersome). So Sunday we hash out what we're doing, make plans, I'm all excited to show her around LI as she had never been here before.

She sends me a text this morning that basically says ""Hey so I'm tired of traveling so I'm just going to stay in the city so I'll see you later when you get here"". I was extremely annoyed. Completely changed and reneged on our plans and left me no ability to counter. I texted her and basically said ""Hey I hear your plight, but I ask you to reconsider because that would mean I'm doing over 5 hours of commuting total to see you today"". Her response; ""It's all good I understand why you can't make it, I'll see you next time!"".

I was super annoyed but also in the middle of the work day so I just let it go. I was mostly over it. But then I come back to my phone to her sending me this long text saying how I'm not allowed to be mad at her because the reason why we can't hang is logistics and that when she originally planned her trip she didn't plan to come to me on LI(the latter to me is invalidated by the fact that *she did* plan to come to LI and reaffirmed them 48 hours ago). To avoid a squabble I told her that I understood and blah blah.

But for real, as per her text, am I seriously not allowed to be mad at her? She's conveniently forgetting the part where she cancelled the plans last second and expected me to switch my entire day around in a heartbeat."		1	0

bx6kpd	2019-06-05 19:14:07	throwitallaway_y	AITA if I invite a friend's sibling to a party out of courtesy?	"This happened a while when we were in middle school, but it has got me thinking.

Friend - F

Twin Sister - TS

&#x200B;

I had invited my friend to my birthday party and invited her twin sister so she wouldn't feel left out. TS and I didn't talk much, so we were really more of acquaintances. Even so, it was, I thought, a normal thing to invite acquaintances to birthday parties.

&#x200B;

TS ended up being moody and I wondered why she came if she was going to act like that. I called her out on it and somehow we ended up talking about how I invited TS because she was F's sister not because we were especially close. That wasn't really what I meant, but it came out that way.

&#x200B;

Looking back on it, I think she was hurt that I invited her as a sort of plus one instead of her own individual person. Because of my outburst, we stopped being friends because TS thought I hated her and F stopped associating with me too because she couldn't be friends with someone who didn't like her sister.  In the present, I don't really hate TS...but I'm not willing to understand her personality (she also has OCD which likely contributed to her hurt that day) and that makes me an asshole.

&#x200B;

Still I wonder, in general at least, is it wrong to invite someone for courtesy's sake? Like, even if I enjoyed their company, but we weren't really friends either (?). I used to invite siblings of my friends because we got along even if we weren't especially close.

&#x200B;

Like is it rude to invite people out of courtesy even if you get along well? Is that against social convention?"	Asshole	0	0

"I just broke up with my gf of 5 years because last week I found out that she had been cheating on me with her ex-husband. 
When we first started dating, it was difficult because she had just gone through a divorce but eventually we worked it out. During the first year of our relationship , we moved in together and at the time she was still struggling to start a small restaurant  so I offered to lend her some money. And she told me she would pay me back when she could finally stand on her own feet with the restaurant. And gradually it started to work out well. 

But I loved her so much that when she gave me the money a year later,  I told her to keep it because I knew her business was only getting past the start-up phase and she still needed it more than I did. She could always pay me back later. 

Last week I confronted her about her ex-husband because lately people had been telling me about seeing them together a lot while I was away at work and she confessed to me that he wanted to get back together with her. And she knew a part of her has always wanted to have him back. She told me she was sorry and she loved me as well it's just she can never be her true self other than being with him. 

It hurt me a lot and I started to yell at her calling her a liar and other horrible things to say. And I also told her that I wanted my money back as soon as possible. She wanted me to give her a month so she could have enough time to look for a loan or something because it was a hell lot of money. But I angrily told her that she could borrow the money from her ex-husband and I wanted the money by the end of next week. I could tell that she was really hurt by things I said that night. But I was so terribly hurt myself and want to get it over with as soon as possible so I could forget her. 

A few days ago, I heard from a friend that she had sold her restaurant and filed for bankruptcy because apparently she still had some dignity which prevented her from borrowing some money from her ex-husband and that makes me feel bad. Am I The Asshole Here?


INFO :

At the time I lent her the money she knew that I'd been saving money to buy a house so eventually she would have to pay me back. I am not sure if it's appropriate the write down the number here but I know one of the reason she filed for the bankruptcy was because she had to pay me back. It was only a small restaurant after all."	Not the A-hole	0	0

He moved out of state so we didn't really communicate for a while. Since he has been back we hang out about once a week, usually I go over to his place. 

Tom has been with his girlfriend for a few years now. It took a while but I slowly came to the realization that I am more excited to see her than him when we hang out. I feel like she really understands me and cares about me. 

I want to tell her the truth, that I've fallen for her. I don't care if she doesn't feel the same. I pride myself on being an honest person, and I don't want to hide this. I don't expect anything in return, but if the situation was reversed, I would hope someone would be truthful with me.

I told my cousin who is also my roommate, and he warned me against telling her. He said I would be burning a bridge and that she probably wouldn't even want to know. I told him that she deserves the truth, but he disagreed and said it would be better to say nothing.

I am currently studying for exams, have been for past few weeks, and those little fucking snot monkeys are so fucking loud. Genuinely, they aren't screaming, they're screeching, it sounds like a fruit bat being stabbed over and over again, with a dieing fox.

It is so fucking annoying, and ideally they should die. Can you tell I'm angry?

On a serious note, would I be the asshole if i shouted at them out the window or had a talk with their parents?

I mean on one hand they are just kids playing in their own garden. On the other I'm having very significant exams soon, and those kids are being more than just normal loud. My other neighbours have kids - they play - they're fine cos they keep it normal. These ones are so loud, it gave me an earache all the way from their nextdoor garden to my upstairs room with closed windows.

My opinion is also obviously shifted by my hatred to kids and strong views on parenting.

So WIBTA?

Edit: No I don't actually wish them death. Just got carried away.  Some info: The screeching lasts literally hours, which is almost impressive. It is 9 in the evening. No I don't feel good shouting at kids? Did you not read the post? I agree they're just being kids, on the other hand, I live on a corner, and have a garden joined to many others, nearly all with kids who put together aren't as loud as these."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx6c1j	2019-06-05 18:54:39	HugeAsparagus	AITA for not making any effort to spend time with my older brother or his family? My parents think I’m being unfair.	"Hi everyone, here is the situation:

My family and I came to the united states when I was young. The country we come from is really politically fucked up and conservative, a lot of people there hold views that would be considered really racist, homophobic, etc. in the states. My brother spent his entire childhood in said country, while I spent mine in America. Because of this, we have some extremely differing views. He constantly calls me a “silly liberal”.

My brother and I are also 15 years apart. When I was little, I used to look up to him a lot and cared about his opinion. However, as I got older, I noticed that he always made really insensitive, awful jokes and held opinions I found really hurtful. I would always argue and fight with him about the things he said.

The tipping point was a couple of years ago, on a family vacation. I identify as bisexual, but this was before I was “out” to my family. We were eating at a restaurant. and he said gay people were disgusting. I argued with him for about an hour. At one point, I said 

“What would you do if I was gay and marrying a girl, huh? How would you treat me?” 

And he responded by saying “If that happened, I would be disgusted and disappointed. I would feel as though I lost my little sister. I would go to your disgusting wedding but I would probably cry the whole time.”

Since then, I basically stopped caring about him or his opinion. He is married, and while his wife is more “mild” in her opinions, she says and does things that are similar. She thinks gay men are creepy, trans people are faking it, etc. She also yells at waitstaff and employees if she doesn’t get her way. They have two children, and live in another state that’s about a 2-day drive from me.

I could visit them. Or call, or text. I could make an effort to visit them in their state, I could join the fb group they made for sharing pics of their kids, but I just don’t, because I don’t give a shit. I send happy birthday texts and get gifts shipped to their home for holidays, but I have never made an effort to spend more than a passing moment with them and their children, and I don’t plan to.

I don’t really like/care about kids so I don’t feel any sense of loss from not meeting them, and I can already see his views rubbing off on his own children in the few moments I have spent with them. I’m poor and in college so right now I can use the excuse that I don’t have the time and money to visit, but soon that won’t be the case as I’m graduating. 

I plan on avoiding them for the most part, but my parents are really angry and saying that I should be really involved with his life, and that I should be a “cool aunt” to these children. I think otherwise— the only reason he isn’t openly disgusted with me is just because I haven’t come out to him, so why should I give him and his family the time of day?

bx6ao4	2019-06-05 18:51:38	roommateadviceneeded	AITA for begging a floormate to let me move in with her because my roommates sucked?	"I just finished my freshman year of college. I had a rough first semester not only adjusting to college life and being almost 2,000 miles away from my family and friends, but also because my first semester roommate was awful. 

Her best friend didn't like her roommate so she moved in with us. (My roommate and her friend shared a bed.) My RA wouldn't kick the other girl out so I was stuck with two other people in this tiny room. On top of that, they constantly skipped class and partied all night so they'd come home drunk at 3 a.m. when I had to get up at 7 a.m. for class. Of course, they always skipped their early classes. Luckily, I got the room to myself on the weekends since they would go back to their hometown. I sank into a deep depression but still managed to make straight As my first semester. It was a rough time for me.

At the end of the first semester, I heard that the girl across the hall, who I had become friends with, was going to have a room all to herself after her roommate moved off campus. I asked her if she'd be willing to let me move in with her and be her roommate because my roommate situation was so bad. (She knew about the situation. Everyone did.) She told me that she wanted a single room, was willing to pay the extra cost, and didn't want a roommate. (You can only get a single room if your roommate moves out.) 

I was desperate and practically begged her to let me move in. I had no other options since our RA was no help and I explained to her why I'd make a good roommate (I'm clean, I respect people's things, I care about my grades, I don't party, etc.) 

She eventually agreed, I moved in, and everything was good on my end. This was the first time I'd been happy in months. She's a really nice person and I wonder if I took advantage of her kindness. I respected her space, didn't listen to music if she wanted to study in our room, and if she and her boyfriend wanted the room to themselves, I would go elsewhere for an hour or so. Thinking back, I should have figured something else out but I was desperate. I didn't know what else to do. 

Obviously, I will be getting a new roommate for next year. Hopefully this time it will be better.

Yesterday I was having some contractions, call my doctor, and he tells me to head to the labor & delivery ward at the hospital I’m delivering at and that they would take care of me until he could get there and talk to me. 

I go in and they put me in a room, yadda yadda. My husband gets there, and we’re just playing a waiting game. My dr finally gets there, turns out I’m in early labor and wants me to stay for 24 hours to monitor me. My husband and I’s plan is to not call a ton of family members until it’s REALLY the real deal, because we don’t wanna work everyone up over a possible false alarm. However, he did tell one of his close friends what was going on and I tell my cousin, and that was it. I forget to mention to my cousin not to say anything and she accidentally lets it slip to her mom, who in turn tells MY mom.

A bit of a back story about our relationship— my mom and I over the years have had..issues. If any of you have ever been over to r/raisedbynarcissists, she’s the kind of parent you would hear about over there. Months ago, I gave her the ultimatum that she needs to get into therapy to help her get her act together & if she didn’t, she would have no relationship with me or her grandson, because I absolutely refuse to put my child through what I went through growing up. She’s been in therapy since and has slowly been making progress, but she still has no sense of boundaries & it’s a department she still needs to work in.

ANYWAY, she finds out and immediately texts me asking if I’m ok. I give her the gist of what’s going on, tell her nothing’s happening as of now, & she says “ok, keep me updated” I say that I will. However. 30 minutes later, she proceeds to text me asking a ton of questions, basically trying to update herself, because I’m not giving her every detail (and I was really playing a waiting game and there were no updates to give anyway). If I don’t respond fast enough, she texts my husband asking HIM what’s going on, and tells HIM to keep her in the loop. This goes on the. whole. time. I’m hooked up to an IV. In a gross hospital gown. Having to ask permission to use the bathroom because I had to be unhooked from machines that were monitoring the baby/my contractions. In an uncomfortable as fuck bed. I’m pregnant, in pain & irritable. I don’t want to be text bombed and have to worry about constantly responding. At least if you want to keep texting me, talk about something else to keep my mind off of it, idk.

I know when I’m in active labor, it’s going to be 10 times worse. If I’m not able to respond, she’s going to be harassing my husband. I understand that she’s concerned & that’s okay, but we fully plan on updating the people who can’t be there.

&#x200B;

My mom is the embodiment of those raised by narcissists and family abuse subreddits. Never laid a hand on me except for once. She is just highly manipulative and cruel. She has emotionally abused me since I was a toddler. Probably earlier, but obviously I can't recall. However, my mother is upper middle class and charges $400 an hour, she is her own boss of a very important business in my town. I got into my dream school and while she refuses to discuss finances most of the time with me, she is paying for more than half of my tuition. That is a ***BIG*** deal. Like, huge. I am incredibly grateful. My mom has manic disorder, and when she is her loving self, I do love her and get along with her. It's just awful because I don't know which side of my mom I'd be getting when she gets home from work or wakes up in the morning. She is, irrefutably an abusive individual, despite the great times we've shared.

I make $18.50 an hour and I'm 18. I just graduated high school and am starting college on August 21st. It is unbearable living with her. There is character limit on this subreddit (maybe all, idk really) so I'll answer specifics if you deem them necessary in the comments. I have friends with apartments or spare bedrooms ranging from 19-early 20s and are fully willing to let me move in and pay rent. Crunching the numbers, I can 100% afford.

At first we were using condoms, but we got birth control pills since it works better and we don't need to use a condom (both of us say it changes things drastically.)

Unfortunately, my GF comes from a religious, conservative, asian family, so that comes with the expectation that you get high grades and a relationship (much less sex) is a no-no. She told her dad that she was dating me a few months in (but not that we were having sex) and he told her not to tell her mom, so that's what we did. Unfortunately, one day my GF and I were walking around and met one of her mom's friends. Word got to her mom that she had a boyfriend and a couple days later, mom starts grilling my GF about everything. Mom kept insisting that my GF was dating and that we were having sex; at first she denied everything but eventually came out and told her that she was. Dad only found out we were having sex from this event. The details on the grilling all come from my GF so I can't verify if anything is missing.

We meet up with her Dad to talk about this. First thing he does is ask us to simply stop having sex, but we can keep dating. Being horny teenagers, we told him that wasn't going to work. He then asked if we were using condoms. I told him no, because I was never on board with the whole ""hide the relationship and lie to your parents"" thing, but that we were using birth control instead. He got pretty angry about that unsurprisingly, since all the burden is put onto my GF, and if she gets pregnant, she has to deal with the consequences, and there doesn't seem to be a legal way to bind me to the burden. Dad also cares a lot about my GF's education, and thankfully, not much about her religion (unlike her mom who sent daily bible quotes after the grilling.)

Dad eventually proposed a compromise that we wear condoms during sex, and that he and Mom let us continue. I said no, that wasn't enforceable. Obviously he got annoyed. He also asked if I was willing to use other contraception on my side. I said yes, but that I didn't know of any other form of male contraception besides condoms. He told me there were pills for men and such, but I couldn't find anything on the internet talking about it and we never learned about anything in our school's sex ed (frankly, this gave me the impression he knew very little about contraception, and possibly sex, at all.) Eventually he had to leave.

Being a minor and the dude, I'm legitimately not sure if I'm the asshole in this situation. My GF was annoyed at me not saying yes to the condom compromise since she would just continue to lie to her parents and we would continue to not use it. AITA?"		1	0

bx645r	2019-06-05 18:36:42	potentialasshole2469	AITA for going to a sex party despite my partner being on the fence about it? (Non-graphic but somewhat NSFW)	"From the title, yeah, obviously, but hear me out.

Context info: A few years ago, I (20s F) temporarily moved back to my hometown for around 6 months for medical reasons. I’d been with my partner for something like 3 years at that point. My partner has been very vocal about how much they would want an open or poly relationship for the majority of our time together (they’ve never brought it up again after that summer), which isn’t my thing, but since we were living apart for the first time in two years I decided to give it a shot. The guidelines were that we could both have sexual partners provided we took precautions against STIs and that there would be no romantic engagement. 

I struggle with making friends in non-somewhat structured environments and had no hobbies I was confident enough with to meet people through them. My partner and I really enjoy BDSM, though we’re not super compatible on specifics. All things considered, I decided I’d look into going to a kink party in the area. I ran it by my partner and they said sure, but they aren’t comfortable with me having sex with people with penises, at least the first time I went. That irritated me since it felt invalidating to the lesbian sex I was gunning for, but I was happy to respect that stipulation. 

Here’s the part that I’ve always questioned. I pushed a bit and asked if they would be fine with sex that didn’t involve people with penises. They hesitated but reassured me that they were fine with it when I double checked. I tend to avoid doing anything that could possibly upset them, and had been working on this tendency in therapy as it significantly holds me back from doing a lot of things I want to do, so I decided to pursue this. I’m on the fence about whether that was the right choice or not.

I went to the party, had an awesome time, met some great friends, and hooked up with a delightful girl. I checked in throughout the night to see how my partner was doing, and they told me they were fine. I started going to the weekly party as often as I could, mostly for the friends and fun community (ever played sexy jenga?) but I also would hook up with a lady friend or three probably every other time I’d go. My partner eventually broke down when we were doing our nightly video chat and said that they’d never been ok with me going, and that they didn’t want me going anymore. I was broken-hearted but of course respected their wishes, and we decided to go back to having a fully monogamous relationship. 

They’ve never tried to make me feel like an asshole over this, but I think about it a lot. I had no malicious intent, but I still pushed something they weren’t 100% comfortable with initially. So what do y’all think? AITA?

Edit: I am still very in love with my partner, and am lucky enough to also have their love as well. We don’t have consistent issues that cause conflict; we are very happy together and don’t plan to change that. I’m looking for perspective on specifically the situation I described, not on our relationship as a whole."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We split custody week to week. My ex is very Christian (that’s fine) and she tries to share those values with our son. I’m not religious at all, but I don’t care if she wants to teach our son about that stuff. 

Now, I’m a pretty blue collar guy, and I work in an environment were it’s totally fine to swear. I try to tone it down around my son, but the occasional word slips out. Long story short, my son repeated a swear in front of his mother — he said “Jesus f*cking Christ.” My ex isn’t as mad about the f*ck part, but she’s furious about the taking the lords name in vain part. She’s threatening not to drop off my son on Sunday (the start of my week), and she told her pastor what I “taught” my son. My ex and pastor also want to come to my house and confront me, but I told her the pastor isn’t welcome in my home.

On our first day we went to eat lunch in the restaurant. My boyfriend was already sitting at a table while I went to grab some more food, when the cook approached me to ask if I wanted to go grab a coffee with him, if he could have my number, Instagram,...

The next day I was laying at the pool when the life guard (my bf was buying cigarettes) came to me to ask me if I was there alone. When I said no he asked me if I was married, and when I said I had a bf he just said 'ok' and turned around.

I also posted some photos on Instagram with the location of the hotel, and I immediately got messages from employees (they sent me pictures of them behind a bar) and when I didn't respond, they sent me some angry emojis. In the 5 days I was there, more than 10 different guys messaged me.

Me and this girl I didn't know well started a roasting session on the bus ride home from school.

It was all fun and games, we weren't saying anything offensive until she called me a stick bug. I'm a tall skinny person so it made sense, it even made me laugh but my logic was ""if she can make fun of my body I can make fun of hers"" 

I then proceeded to say she's built like a minivan and almost immediately she starts crying. I apologise and try to get her to stop crying but it's too late. All of her friends were yelling at me and calling me a body shamer 

The next day at school I got a 1 day iss (in school suspension) for and I quote ""making fun of someone's body...

She litterally made fun of my body too! I don't think it was fair for only me to get in trouble.

Edit 1: I am underweight and it's common knowledge that I am. Even though I laughed it off it seemed to be a weird thing to say in the moment because we were joking and that one thing she said and the way she said it kind made it seem like she was trying to make a personal dig at me.

Also I knew her because we are in the same homeroom class and we sit at the same table at lunch. I don't really talk to her at all other than those instances.

Trying to be frugal, we bought a fridge from a discount appliance wholesaler, but fast forward a month and the freezer was not getting down to freezing temperature. We looked into getting it repaired, but we found it would basically be cheaper to just cut our losses and buy a new one.

Still, we didn't just want to be out $500, so we decided to sell it on facebook and get at least a portion of the money back. We included the fact that the freezer was broken in the description, and found an interested buyer, who came to pick it up. The problem is, when he showed up, he couldn't speak English very well, and I don't speak that much Spanish. I expressed to him that the freezer would need to be fixed, but I'm not 100% sure that he understood me and I can't shake the feeling that I ripped him off.

bx5wtf	2019-06-05 18:19:59	Yuenneh	AITA for getting bad at my sister for taking something without my permission?	"So I really like reading and in the last few weeks I bought a lot of YA books (I’m 15,  16 in July ,May be important to some ppl) to read over the summer vacation.

In my opinion , books here (Romania) are quite expensive , around 45 lei( aprox 10 dollars )keeping in mind that I get allowance 9 (aprox 2 dollars) lei a week (well he always forgets so we get all in a couple of months ) and obviously I buy other stuff too...

Now, one thing I love about buying NEW books is being the first ever person to read that exact book. 

My sister (17) also enjoys reading , although not as much and more non-fiction but still happy to have someone to share my books with and talk about them. So , obliviously I recommend my books to her and give some for her to read .

But yesterday morning , I found my newest book open (just like turned upside down to not lose the page)on the floor of the bathroom . I buy paperback most of the time ‘cause they’re cheaper and why not? But the thing with paperback is that the cover can easily be bend (obv) , and I try to avoid that most of the time because I want to keep my books as good as possible.

Well , this cover was pretty bend ,not a really big issue but it annoys me .

So I grabbed the book and yelled at my sister for taking it without permission , leaving it there (where my dad wouldn’t even notice if he stepped on it ) and bending the cover.

Now she is mad at me for yelling (which she does all the time at me , but that no bigge , eh?) at her . And she refuses to apologize for my book because I have to apologize FIRST (keep in mind SHE IS 17 )because I yelled at her , and I gave her “permission “to read a book of mine ( I allowed her to read A quiet Kind Of Thunder , which I knew she would love, NOT my newest book)

I know this is petty , but I don’t think ppl have the right to just take something precious from somebody else and “break “ it.

Backstory: This one girl in my Spanish class is dating a friend of mine. The girl has bad anxiety. She doesn’t really like me much, and the same vice versa. She is also doing things like cutting me off, or just not letting me by my friend.

We had a free period in Spanish since it’s nearing the end of the year and didn’t have much work to do. So I go back to my friend to talk to him. Every time I’d go to talk, the girl kept cutting me off and wouldn’t let me speak. After a while, I thought of a joke and once I had a chance, I said the joke. The girl looked at me and said “Say that joke again I dare you”. The joke was about a annoying song the teacher kept playing. 

I was pretty pissed off at this point because she kept cutting me off, and now she was getting pissed off at one joke. So I turn to her and say “How about you repeat it in front of the entire class?” She then calls me a asshole and storms off. My friend agrees with her and follows her. Are they correct? AITA?"

This isn't about something specific but it is mote in general about of it is an open topic or not to talk about abortion. I started to ask myself this when I was in class a while back and someone made a joke with something along the lines of a 

""you're  the result of a broken condom.""

I tagged along and said, ""why not say failed abortion"" 

Keep in mind since I was little I moved states and I'm pretty sure this person is pro choice. It went a little quiet and he said that it was too controversial of a topic to make fun of. I honestly did not know that it was. My knowledge of the anti abortion movement is limited to that one family guy episode. 

This happened again when I was talking with some friends who I knew but they didn't know each other and when we switched over to political debates (we are all on the same page) one friend stopped the conversation and stated that he is pro choice before turning and asking what she was, she agreed and conversation continued. 

Idk if this goes on this sub. My mom has always talked about how she knows people who have had it for medical reasons and everyone I know has been kind of open about the topic. Is this an open topic?

About a month ago I (19f) got a hamster (djungarian, named Miku). My whole family fell in love with her, especially my little sister (17f). She was constantly wanting to play with her and take her out of her cage, even when I wasn’t home to approve it.

A few weeks ago I was introduced to a friend of a friend, let's call her Polly. I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, and the mutual friend who introduced us told me that Polly was too. Smashing, I thought, someone who gets it. Don't get me wrong, my friends and family are beautiful, understanding people, but I thought it'd be nice to finally have someone to talk to who has firsthand experience. 

No such luck. It became apparent to me rather quickly that Polly was lying. Suspicions initially arose for me when inconsistencies popped up in how she described her symptoms: first she claimed to have only auditory hallucinations, then she claimed to have both auditory *and* visual ones; first she said she'd had symptoms since she was 10, then they didn't start til she was 16. I kinda let that slide because hey, everyone's experience is different, sometimes symptoms *are* inconsistent and people make mistakes with info. But then there started to be other things. She told two different people that she'd been diagnosed at two different ages and gave two entirely separate stories about how she *got* the diagnosis. What sealed it for me was when she started talking about her ""new meds"". I asked her what she was on, and she said lithium. Now, lithium *is* sometimes used in treating schizophrenia, but it's pretty ineffective by itself and is used as a sort of add-on to antipsychotics, rather than being used as the sole treatment. I asked what else she was on and she said nothing, just lithium. 

I called her out on it, then and there. We were in a group of friends at the time. She tried to defend herself at first, so I pulled up the studies that showed the ineffectiveness of lithium as a standalone schizophrenia treatment and the need for it to be paired with antipsychotics. She admitted to lying, then started crying and said she only did it to seem interesting. I was pretty annoyed and told her that it's not on and there's no excuse and it's actually kind of offensive to those of us who *have* the disorder to pretend you have it to seem quirky and different. She ran off in tears. Our friends are in two camps; some of them think I was harsh and mean for showing her up snd then not really caring that she was crying and still telling her how wrong she was, others are telling me I did right by exposing her publicly.

He broke up with me 2 months ago. On the night that he broke up with me, he asked if I would be comfortable keeping the cat until he found a place for him to stay (he couldn't live at my ex's house because his family is allergic). I agreed, but at this point I assumed we would stay friends or get back together. 

My ex proceeded to begin publicly seeing another girl a week later, no word about the cat. I picked up the remainder of my stuff from him a month after the breakup, no word about the cat. I went on a trip out of the country and while there, my ex posted on social media that he was officially in a relationship with the girl he had been seeing (and who, at this point, I'm fairly confident he had cheated on me with). I was tipsy, drinking wine and enjoying my vacation in Spain, and my friends kept sending me photos of them together being like ""oh my godd"" and I didn't want to see it anymore. I was feeling petty and wine drunk and 'laugh reacted' to this relationship status. 

My ex blocked me on all social media after I did this. In turn, I blocked his number for peace of mind. Since then, my best friend who is our mutual friend has also blocked me for no apparent reason. It has been upwards of 3 weeks since he blocked me. Today my dad approached me saying that my ex texted him, saying he made a vet appointment for the cat tomorrow and he would be there to pick him up in the morning. 

After 2 months of no contact regarding the cat, plus the blocking on all forms of social media, I had pretty much assumed the cat was mine. In my opinion, he lost the right to contact me about anything, including the cat, after blocking me. Blocking someone from contacting you implies that you do not intend to speak to them, ever again!! And all of a sudden, he wants to come take the cat that MY FAMILY has financially supported and grown attached to for a year? 

So I called him and he got upset, claiming I couldn't just keep his cat and it isn't fair. But I feel as though he doesn't have the cat's best interest in mind. He's willing to uproot the animal for completely selfish reasons from a home where he has lived for a year, with other cats to play with, a stable financial environment where he will always have what he needs. My family is not okay with giving the cat back to him. 

Am i wrong for believing his chance to make plans regarding our cat was when he blocked me from contacting him in any way?

EDIT: I was told I should add some info -  
My ex did not live with me and my family. Last year, he moved back home from an apartment, but since his family was allergic, we decided the cat could stay with my family until the two of us moved into our own place together. The original arrangement was that the cat would stay with my family for a few months- it has been a year.

The cat is 3 years old. He got him about 5 or 6 months before we started dating. The cat probably doesn't even remember a time that i wasn't around. I personally did not financially contribute to the cat for the 1.5 years he wasn't at my house - however I did watch the cat/take care of him as needed. Then for the past year my parents have assumed full financial responsibility. My ex has not provided food, litter, or anything. The only financial assistance was the vet appointment to get him shots and fixed before he even moved into my house. In addition he did not try to contact me at all regarding the cat since the day we broke up and I said I could keep him for a bit. I wasn't anticipating 2 months of no contact at all, just waiting around for him to decide what to do..."	Asshole	0	0

bx5qjo	2019-06-05 18:05:56		AITA for being annoyed my fiances parents showed up to brunch with my Mom an hour late?	"I had noon reservations on Sunday for myself (M27), my fiance (F28), my mom (f64), and her parents (M and F mid 50s). We get a text at 12:15 saying they are running late, no ETA, just radio silence until they show up at 12:50. They show up and apologized. I made a joke about them running late to try and lighten the mood, ""Ill like my eggs cooked running late"". Really stupid joke I know  but was honestly trying to lighten the mood. We went on to have a nice brunch. And when my fiances Dad got up to go to the bathroom, he paid the bill so the check didnt even come to the table. 

&#x200B;

The reason they gave for running late I dont believe. They said they couldnt find a credit card and spent an hour looking for one. Her Dad went to this huge party at a golf course the night before and I think he was hungover the next day. 

&#x200B;

Later that night my Fiances Mom called about wedding stuff and my fiance mentioned that the both of us were annoyed they were so late. Its since blown up to being this big deal about how we need to let it go. Their basic argument is we had a nice day, we apologized, we payed the check, what else can we do? After a couple days of them texting my fiance she has come around to their view point that I shouldnt be annoyed by it at this point. 

&#x200B;

It still annoys me because the principal of it. Like just because you say your sorry doesnt mean you can do shitty things. I am pretty sure they are lying about the reason they are late, which seems childish. Ill admit there really isnt anything they can do right now that will change the way I feel. Im not saying anything to her parents directly, but Im still annoyed with it.

bx5oac	2019-06-05 18:00:48	bridalpartyproblems	AITA for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?	"Throwaway because my sister knows my Reddit. 

I’m getting married next year and I’m so excited about it. My fiancé has all his groomsmen picked out, and I’m in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I’d also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I’m sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. 

I drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he’d be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said “Will you be a part of my Bride Tribe?”, deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E’s ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.

Fast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E’s reaction didn’t go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to “fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold” despite his transition. I tried to explain that I’d picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn’t get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me “basic” and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.

I guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he’d be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he’s still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it’s best if he isn’t a part of the bridal party. My fiancé says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I’m being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. She says I should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. She says I should give E a second chance and if I don’t it will cause all kinds of family drama.

Would I be the asshole if I refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

ETA: 
Wow, I cannot believe how much this blew up. So I’m going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

E sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for “snapping at me”. He admitted he was wrong and it was “totally out of line” and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party “if I’d have him”. Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven’t sent any response yet. 

A also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

ALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx5kuj	2019-06-05 17:52:59		AITA for telling my future mother in law to shut the f*** up?	"My fiance and I got engaged about 7 months ago and we have been through a lot over 4 years of dating but have always found a way through it even with a pretty significantly long ""break"" in the middle of our relationship. We have moved on from the past and there are no problems there. Long story short, her mother goes out to an event with her family without us and invites a man my fiance cheated on me with (Keep your thoughts on cheating to yourself) . The mother says he was her last resort and she had to have someone. As my future mother-in-law I felt extremely betrayed and felt as though she didn't give a shit about me or her daughter. We were both very angry towards her mother and the mother said ""I don't see why it's a big deal since you both are over what happened."" Implying that we weren't actually over it. This made us much more angry to the point where we cut her out of our lives for about 2 weeks before she texted me while she was drinking and said ""Be careful, she's only with you for the money, don't say I didn't warn you."" I replied with ""Shut the fuck up"" and blocked all communication with her. My fiance and I split rent and both work full time, so the mother was referring to my parents money which is more than average but not overly substantial. They take us on a trip or 2 a year but make me rely on myself the majority of the time.

&#x200B;

Edit: Her mother did not know the guy before and has no reason to communicate with him. And once again I am not here for advice on cheating, that topic is resolved."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx5jif	2019-06-05 17:50:01	hippiegoblin	WIBTA if I I told my MOH I want my sister to do it instead?	"So I’ve had a very rocky friendship with my current maid of honor. She has a tendency to drop off the face of the planet when she has a “boyfriend”. (I’m quotes because she has a penchant for men who already have wives and says that she is Polyamorous).  

Now, I try very hard to always be a cheerleader for her. And when she cancels plans I am always understanding. But, when her second to last affair inevitably blew up she sent me screenshots of the texts messages and I felt really hurt by something she said: 


MOH: “I gave up all my money for you! All my friends!”

Married Man: “your money all goes to the apartment you pay $$$ for! And I never asked you to give up your friends!”

MOH: “I did it willingly!”


Now this hurt because every time she breaks up with the guy she ditches me for we go back to normal and she says how it will “never happen again.” Now, I love her. So I’ve always just been here for her when it happens. So seeing her just spell it out like that, like she made the conscious decision to do it really hurt and I’ve been feeling a disconnect ever since. I’ve been trying to just move past it but in conjunction with this she has been completely disinterested in any and all wedding planning talk. 

She came over to discuss bridal shower/bachelorette things and she spent the entire time on her phone while I basically did the outlines by myself. And just recently the rest of the bridal party and I went to try on wedding dresses. Again, she spent the entire time on her phone, refused group conversation, only spoke to me and another bridesmaids, got so stoned she couldn’t keep her eyes open. She did take pictures and videos of the wedding dresses but didn’t send them until late the next day and she sent them on Snapchat so I couldn’t save the videos and only got pictures of two of the dresses with filters. 

Now, my older sister has been incredibly helpful and excited and “all-in” with wedding planning, offering her backyard for the ceremony and in general keeping me feeling excited and not silly for talking about it. I feel regret picking current MOH. 

I’m feeling so much anxiety over this and I want to know if I would be an asshole if I just asked her to step down."	No A-holes here	0	0

My late husband died serving when my daughter was 1yo and she is 8 now. My stepdaughter is 9. I'm her primary care giver because her mother is also deceased.

Yesterday was my stepdaughter's birthday and my daughter's birthday was on Sunday. I always wanted to celebrate their birthdays on the same day( I'm referring to the party ), preferably the following weekend because of our work schedules. But my husband felt that it would send a wrong message to the kids and insisted we have separate parties for both. Okay, fine by me. Recently I learned how to bake and I promised the girls that I'd bake a cake for them. So my daughter asked if I could do that for her on her birthday. I told her I would. My stepdaughter wanted the same, so I told her I'd do that for her too. 

I baked a cake on Sunday and it was a huge mess. I had do it again and it was cumbersome. The end result was great but I was really tired. Yesterday was a working day and I was aldready tired. So I told my stepdaughter that I was too tired to bake a cake. She got really upset and she ended up not wanting a party. My husband got really upset and told me that I'm discriminating against them and showing them preferential treatment. I was also really pissed and told him he can bake a cake for his daughter.

bx5ihr	2019-06-05 17:47:36	RaffyGiraffy	AITA for not accepting a handmade clock as a wedding gift?	"I'm 30 and just got married recently.  My uncle wants to give me a clock he made as a wedding gift to us. Background: He is my father's brother, and my father has decided he didn't want anything to do with us since I was 12. My father forced my uncle and my grandparents to choose between him and us. My grandparents chose my father and I have also not spoken with them for over 15 years. My uncle tried to keep a relationship with us, and while we do appreciate it, it was strained as they are textbook narcissists.

I was seeing them maybe 2-3 times a year, but then something happened a few years ago that made me want to discontinue the relationship. My sister went there for Christmas, as she was working Christmas Eve and Boxing Day, and home was 5 hours away so my uncle invited her to stay over Christmas Eve. On Christmas Day, she was about to go shower and get ready for the day with them and they then informed she would have to leave because our grandmother (again who cut us out for no reason other than my dad told her to, we were 12 years old) was coming over and felt ""uncomfortable"" that my sister would be there . My sister was shocked as she was not told of this beforehand and  had assumed she was spending the day/ Christmas dinner with them as that's what they said. Thankfully, my husband (boyfriend at the time) went and got her and she spent Christmas with him and his family. They had never met her before but treated her better than my own blood.

Since then, I told my uncle off in a text and said he had a right to choose his mother over my sister but it came with consequences and that that relationship was fractured. My sister tried to explain how much it hurt since she was abandoned by my father and grandparents and he basically did the same thing, and how he could have at least told her in advance that she would have to leave, but he barely apologized. In the 2 years since this happened, I have not spoken to them. There's so much more I could type here with all the fucked up stuff they have done, but it would be too long. the Christmas thing was the straw that broke the camels back. 

So fast forward to April 2019, I get a missed call and voicemail from my uncle saying he had made us a wedding gift and wanted to meet up to exchange it. Keep in mind I had not seen or talked to him in over 2 years and he was not invited to the wedding. I decided to text him my address and said he could mail it, as we were having a destination wedding and didn't have time to meet up. I came back from our wedding to an envelope with a printed picture of a handmade clock saying it was too fragile to ship and when can we meet up so he can give it to us? 

I decided I want to write them a letter and decline the gift and explain why, however some of my friends that know the story think I should just suck it up and accept the gift since he took the time to make it, and I would be rude to decline. What do you guys think?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx5hue	2019-06-05 17:46:05	WoeToTheUsurper7	WIBTA for choosing the expensive university?	"When my parents first brought up the topic of universities about two years ago , they basically told me that unless I wanted to study abroad I only have 2 colleges to choose from. (they said the other colleges here were not really great)

Now I've only got about one week left to take a decision and this is incredibly hard so I needed some unbiased opinions. 

Let's call the two universities Uni A and Uni B. 

Both of my parents would prefer having me go to Uni B. For some context, Uni B is a french university. I'm good at french but I attended an english school so I'm not really used to studying math or sciences in french. Uni A is ranked higher than Uni B and all my courses would be in english. 

I know this isn't that big of a deal but Uni A also has a much nicer campus and I think I would be way happier there than I would be in the other university.

Now the problem is that Uni A is more expensive than Uni B. It can be afforded but it most probably will affect my parents' lifestyle.

I also want to add that my parents expected me to choose Uni B, so when they told me that it would be hard to afford Uni A's tuition, I got angry and told them that they've watched me worry about this for months now and told them they should have just told me no from the beginning and never have offered it to me as a choice.

Now there are several reasons I wouldn't be so happy at Uni B but I wanted to choose it because I don't really want to make my parents pay so much, but all of my other family/friends are telling me I should go to Uni A since it's a better university and I would be much happier there.

And before anyone says I'm spoiled, it is more or less the norm here for parents to pay their children's tuition fees (if they can afford it), and there are also other cheaper unis who also would have given me a decent scholarship that I didn't apply to.

bx5h9g	2019-06-05 17:44:48	renauster	"AITA For ending a ""friendship"" in which I felt uncomfortable?"	"First of all, I'm sorry for the long post. I'm just very conflicted and I need to really give you guys the context for everything, and it kinda goes a long way back.

So this guy and I had been friends for about six years or so, we met in elementary school, we were childhood friends.

But when middle school came around, he began treating me different than anyone else. Since this is around the age where everyone wants to get to the top and be ""Popular"", he wasn't any different. So he started to use me as comedical value, and to make himself look better. He would often push me around or hit me (Sometimes with a lot of force) just to make people laugh or look at him. And this means everyone, people inside and outside our friends circle. He'd insult me, say mean things, interrupt me... Basically, I was just standing there, behind him, as his shadow.

The first time I stood up for myself was in our second year of middle school. I was just done and decided to block him on all social media and ignore him. Then multiple people from our friends circle would come up to me and tell me how many awful things he'd been saying about me, and just how angry he got whenever people mentioned me.

Third year of middle school though, he comes up to me and starts talking to me like we were all-time buddies. I, being the idiot I am, decided to go along with it. He didn't even apologise or anything, I just decided to accept him back.

At first, everything was good. Not going to lie, it was great to have a friend back. But as expected, everything went back to how it was before.

Whenever something went wrong, I was there with him. I was always willing to help a friend, because that's just how I am, but whenever I was the one on the ground, he would just not be a friend at all. I had this other friend who helped me through absolutely everything, and HE never did anything. Hell, this ""other"" friend I mentioned, he was REALLY into her. And she was kinda interested in him, so I got them both together, they dated for like a month, then they broke up, and he started spreading rumours about her! I told her this, she cut all contacts with him, and now she's studying at another school.

Now, we're in high school, and I was just so sick and tired of him throwing shit at me, and so mad that he was enough of a shit bag to date this girl and then throw shit at her too, that I just collapsed and went off on him. I told him about everything he'd done and how I felt horrible all this time and he never wanted to change or never asked how I felt.

He got REALLY mad.

Some other friends were also there so they kinda backed me up and said that they also noticed how he was even more of an asshole towards me than them, and that he should change for the better. He did not want to change. Instead though, he spit out tons of good ol' mexican insults and left. Not saying anything else afterwards. Now I don't know if I did the right thing."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx5glr	2019-06-05 17:43:20		AITA For screaming at and berating a woman who blocked my car off in the parking lot?	"I and a couple hundred other people went to an event a few days ago that lasted 30 minutes, after it ended I got out of the building and back in my car and other people started to do so as well.

To paint the picture there was a car to the left of me and one to the right of me in parking lot spaces. In front of me was the sidewalk so I could not drive forward. Behind me was the road but I could not pull out and someone had parked their car behind me in a way that their doors were facing my trunk and were blocking off my car and the car to the left of us.

The person took 10-15 minutes to get out of the building after us. During this time many people were leaving the building and driving away.

No one came in to the car to the left of us that was being blocked off the entire time I was there. The car to the right of us eventually drove away. After that i tried backing in to the right parking space so I could try and get out but the car behind us was parked so close that I was not able to.

Eventually this lady comes and is like ""Sorry! do you want to get out?"" I just screamed ""ARE YOU AN IDIOT WHY WOULD YOU PARK AND BLOCK ALL OF US OFF?""

Her- (yelling) ""EXCUSE ME? YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT

Me- (more yelling) YOU'RE BLOCKING ME OFF BY PARKING IN THE ROAD

Her- THERE WEREN'T ANY SPACES IN THE PARKING LOT AND THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER PARKING NEAR BY. YOU CAN'T YELL AT ME LIKE THIS

Me- THEN YOU GET BACK IN YOUR CAR ASAP IF YOU BLOCK SOMEONE OFF. PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE IDIOTS AND RUIN THINGS FOR EVERYONE ELSE. LATIN COUNTRIES ARE ALL MESSED UP BECAUSE OF IDIOTS LIKE YOU NOT BEING CONSIDERATE AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERYTHING.

(Side note we are both Latino and one of the good things about the US/developed countries is that people usually follow the fules unlike in may latin/developing countries. Also, I know she’s latino cause she was speaking Spanish to her husband.

I walk back to my car then she comes up and yells in my window- YOU AREN'T MY FATHER YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THIS.

I basically repeat what I said earlier.

She stormed off.

I go and sit in my car for 2-3 min until she comes back and says pull your car back up. (My car was a few inches from hers from when I tried pulling in to the space to the right of me. I'm pissed and say no this is your lesson for taking too long.

She then gets in her car and drives off to another parking spot.

I pull out and as I'm leaving I yell one last time- if you move here you should follow the laws of this country, fuckin bitch. Then I drive off.

TL;DR- A woman parked her car on the side of the road in a parking lot behind my car so I couldn't pull out. She comes 10-15 min later and I start yelling at her loudly for why she would do this and why she took so long to get out. She yelled back for me screaming at her. She finally pulled her car away and parked in a now open space. I drive off and yell fuckin bitch at her."		1	0

"Tl:dr- My boss and the owner of the company I work for wants me to go water a client’s rhododendrons every day she’s gone for a week. I don’t feel comfortable doing this and don’t want to. WIBTA if I said no? 

I work as a receptionist for a locally owned real estate company. I love it here, but lately my boss is asking me to do a lot of stuff that’s out of my job description as I was hired on mostly just as a customer service rep for our property management side and to screen calls for agents. 
The latest is he asked if I would go water one of his client’s rhododendrons while they’re out of town because they forgot to hire someone to. 
First he asked if I lived nearby to her, I don’t I live across town. I told him this and he nonchalantly said that “oh okay, I was just gonna ask you to swing by there in the mornings before work if you did but that’s okay,” and I said “no, sorry.” And thought it was the end of it. About an hour later he just randomly comes up to me and says, “it’s going to be [the address]” and repeats it twice. I ask for what and he says to water the rhododendrons. I politely go, “I don’t live out there, I live right down the street from the office.” He says he knows and so I am slightly upset and let him know that right now I don’t even have a working car. (My bf drives me or my manager lives right down the road so if I need a ride for whatever reason she picks me up.) He - I think jokingly - says to walk there. And then someone suggests the work truck and he agrees. I say as long as it’s during work hours he says ok. 
Well I just found out that the client wants someone there over the weekend also. Those are my days off and I don’t get paid for those days. I live like 20 mins away from this lady and don’t want to do it on my days off. 
So WIBTA if I told my boss that on the weekend, against his client’s request, I’m not going to water her rhododendrons?

UPDATE- The owner’s wife, who is also my boss, chewed him out and told him that wasn’t my job in the first place and they could not ask me to do it on the weekend, so I didn’t even have to talk to him about it. Now I don’t have to do it at all! So all in all everything is fixed."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We had someone staying on our couch, so I \[21F\] was sharing A's bathroom in A's room. It got to the point I'd have to schedule a time to take a shower. On top of that, seeing random dudes in A's bed made me uncomfortable.

A meets a guy \[?M\]. I try to be considerate. Major problem here: he's condescending, rude, and smells awful. I talked to A about both. I got frustrated with the fact he was over a lot and that he couldn't seem to not do this. It resulted in both myself and rm B hiding in our rooms or leaving.

B and I are relatively neat people. A and A's bf aren't. The trash will overflow, they'll leave trash out on the counter that will start to smell, won't wash the sheets after sex, let A's dog pee in the house, etc. We've tried to address this several times, but then the cycle repeats. 

A's bf was over for 4+ nights over spring break. I talked to A about it and restated my issues with him and requested that he not be here for a week (I had several exams coming up and needed to study). A said that they would do that. Later that week, I was informed that A's bf would be staying over 3 nights. I said no and reminded A about the conversation we'd just had. It was compromised to 1 night.

On top of this, A sells a lot of stuff, so things are constantly in and out and I'm always being asked to help. B has a bike that we kept on campus (no space and didn't want it to get sold). At the end of the semester, we needed to bring the bike home. One day, A decided to sell our bike pump, so we couldn't pump up the tires. We ended up spending 3 hours on this. 

I was busy at work and apparently A was having a rough time. A made no indication that something was wrong. I was in the middle of a project, so I ended up getting distracted and the notifications ended up going away when I messaged someone about the project I was working on. I didn't answer A because by the time I saw the messages, B was sitting next to me and had just replied. I talked to A and explained that. That seemed to satisfy A, but A still told everyone that we wanted absolutely nothing to do with them and that they couldn't understand why. A will leave for several days and never tell us. We fought over this a while back and A got better for a while, but it got to the point where I was expected to look at her calendar and B was never informed. A only recently started taking their dog with them. Before, there was no heads up and an extra dog to take care of.

A's plan was to have their bf over this weekend. My only response was that A needed to talk to B because she doesn't leave her room if A's bf is there (It's actually concerning). At that point, A essentially went off on me, essentially personally attacking me while I was trying to bring up a valid point. Apparently now we're gaslighting A. If A's bf isn't here, A is either asleep, or at his house.

We had a falling out over his current wife because she hates me. She has told him I am forbidden to come by their restaurant because I  never pay for anything I get??? (My dad tells me he makes the food specifically for me) 

She's a spiteful whore and I've even said this to him. I've reached out only wanting to repair and have a relationship but have been met with a wall of ignorance. I have to fight this asshole to even see him and when I gave up, he gets extremely upset yelling at me about how I don't care when I've only tried to have dinner with this man. 

I went NC and he spammed my family so I'd speak to him. I told him if he wants to behave this way and have a relationship with me then help me pay for a car I needed. 

For the past 2 years, he's given money and I feel guilty half the time and the other half, I tell myself that this is the relationship he chose to have with me. 5 minutes, once a month, to pick up cash.

To my credit, I have tried for a few years to rebuild a relationship with him before my step mom stepped in and this was BEFORE he was giving me money.

Am I an asshole for taking his money every month????? I suspect he feels guilty for the way he neglects or treats me so he compensates with money."	Asshole	1	0

Since Father’s Day is approaching, my mom had asked me what I was getting my bf for Father’s Day. I gave her a confused look and told her nothing. She began telling me that I was rude and I should be happy that I found a guy that is still involved with his kid. I let her know that he is not a father figure to me in any way, (he’s not my dad and we have no kids together.)

The reason I feel I should not gift him anything is because I am not involved in his sons life. We have opposite schedules and I have only met his son about 4 times. I think it’d be different if I was involved in his sons life.

Yesterday I was out with my mom doing some shopping and I bought a ceramic duck. One of the staff overheard me talking about it and found it very funny. She said that 'every time he talks about it I have to laugh' and my mom quickly and kind of rudely said 'no thats my DAUGHTER' which upset me. I waited until we were alone in the parkinglot and explained how it upsets me when she does that. I asked her how she would feel if I called her kyle or mark and a guy. She resorted to calling me an it and said that nothing I do will ever change that I was born female.

I’ve never been insensitive about Islam. I always ask, I want to learn and understand. I even did Ramadan with him to support him.

bx4xnp	2019-06-05 16:59:09	SpaceGeneralAmerica	AITA for being mad at my grandmother selling our house she owns?	"Let me explain this situation: my grandmother is a selfish woman who let my dad get away with spousal abuse for over damn near twenty years.

When my mom finally worked up the courage to leave my dad, she had to take all her kids - me and my siblings - with her, but didn't tell any of us we weren't going back home. So we went to America to be with her family with no idea we were staying until she froze the plane tickets back.

Now, after a lot of BS from my grandmother - she's selling our house. Our dad was living in it, and now has to move to England. I don't know the full story, I only know my grandmother has every intention of selling the house.

I'm not upset about her selling the house, and I know she owns it. She bought the house so my family could live in it. But I am upset because she's probably going to sell all our stuff in the house that we had to leave behind.

I made a post on entitled parents about it, and then had a shit ton of people call me entitled for being mad at her, calling me and my family freeloaders and telling us we shouldn't have left out stuff behind. One of them even tried to justify my grandmother putting down our dog, saying that the dog had bitten my grandfather and thus needed to be put down.

Even though said dog wasn't registered in my grandmother's name and thus my grandmother couldn't legally put the dog down. She didn't talk to anyone in my family, she just put the dog down without a second thought.

Am I seriously the asshole in this situation for being mad at my grandmother about her selling the house without even telling us personally beforehand. Didn't contact any of us about the stuff in our house either, so she'll probably throw it all away.

But am I the asshole here for being mad at her doing something which is basically legal?

EDIT: Finally worked up the courage to ask my grandmother about this... and she told me she's just thinking about selling the house, as my dad and brother - to make a long story short, my dad snuck into the states and convinced one of my brothers to go back to Ireland with him - but I have trouble believing that because I know my brother's living with my aunt and uncle.

That having been said... my dad booked plane tickets for me on June 10 to go back to Ireland without even asking me. I have no intention of going, but my grandmother's attempt to convince me to come back amounts to ""you can get a job working for me in the bar."" For context, she owns a hotel with a bar.

That's pretty much all she did. Offered me a job working for her.

Not ""I love you so much"" or ""I can't wait to see you"" just ""would you like a job?""

My dad didn't make a lot of money with that very same job. And I've been trying to find a job here.

EDIT 2: Okay, here's something worth mentioning.

A lot of people have been asking if there's anyone who can take care of our stuff, and there is, a family friend of ours who we entrusted to do just that.

My grandmother, however, locked said family friend out of the house and has prevented her from taking care of our stuff. In other words, because we left, she'd rather our possessions be destroyed than let them be cared for. She only lets my dad and brother into the house."	Asshole	0	0

bx4tbh	2019-06-05 16:48:59		WIBTA for quitting my internship	"Hi all, not too long ago I posted a very similar posting to this exact same circumstance, but centered around family. This post will have more to do with the company itself. I'm horrible at 'stories,' so I apologize in advance if this is difficult to read. I'll be more than happy to clear the air with any questions.

I've been an intern with this company since my freshman year of college. I was approached by a family friend with an opportunity to have my tuition covered, and work year-round gaining experience. Keep in mind that from the beginning, this internship has been a no strings attached deal, if I decided I didn't want to stay on, I could leave. I've learned a great deal and gotten tons of experience, to the point where I won't have a hard time finding a job after graduation. Four years later, I am still in school, struggling very much, and all around very unhappy with my position. The company itself is great, but my department, more importantly, my bosses and horrible. Since I've started, I have had 4 bosses, all with whom were great, until the last one, my current boss. My previous bosses gave me very good projects that helped me learn and made me feel like I was helping the company. I felt valued! My current boss has given me the most meaningless tasks I could be given. I understand that I'm an intern, but the change in tasks have been drastic. I am belittled, and given little to no respect. My previous projects were basically looked over, and I feel as though I am useless. The way this department is ran, is not how most departments are ran, and many have quit because of these bosses, and I've lost all faith that this is actually the profession I want to be in, which has resulted in me struggling to find motivation for work, and most importantly school. Which then has resulted in my (already poor) mental health into a downhill spiral. *Dionmj, why don't you talk to your bosses boss, or your bosses bosses boss?* Let me tell you why, they pretty much have the same brain. What one says, the others will follow, and I promise you, it would not help me at all.

I already have a very difficult time in school, and am close to being done. But I have gotten to the point where the bad outweighs the good. I want to leave the internship, but I feel a tremendous amount of guilt because they have covered my schooling for this long, and I have learned a great deal from them. But my bosses are just making it unbearable. So this is where I come to you, WIBTA for leaving my internship?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

We asked him what was wrong and he told us that he found out that we're not Martians we're Earthlings. Both of our kids are adults now and we have a great time recounting the story and they think it's extremely funny.

She went on to explain that one of her friends parents was actually her girlfriends mom. Her girlfriends mom did not want her to come and stay at a hotel the other mom had paid for and both of our daughters were being kind of sneaky about the whole situation. My daughter is 18 and has never gone on a date with a boy and nor has she told me about any relationships she's ever had. She's been extremely shy ever since she was 12 years old and I told all of my sisters about the boy she had kissed in middle school and we teased her for it at a family function. she has been very elusive and closed off when it comes to relationships. She told me in the middle of the night that she loved her and that she kissed a girl and I've never experienced this before because I came from a very traditional Catholic upbringing. She told me not to tell her father and I feel wrong for lying and withholding something from him especially because at the last minute she could no longer take the flight to Florida. Her father is very confused and wants answers but it's hard to lie and cover up for her when it is a rule in our house that lying is not allowed. AITA to my husband to not tell him?

Now I’m not very particular about my haircut. My regular barber is more of an old fashioned style where its men sitting around just having conversation. This barber was more of the newer style that is young and does a lot of trendy shaping and styles. My regular guy always said he likes when he can work with my hair and head to do what will look best. So I entered the shop thinking this was universal.

When it was my turn, the barber asked what I wanted. I responded “I trust you as the artist to do what’s best”. He went silent for a moment and then said “You gotta tell me what you want me to do”. 

I gave him a little guidance saying “It’s getting hot so I wouldn’t mind it a bit shorter”.  His responses started to show some frustration. I really didn’t know what to say as I never really think about what I want. 

Since I realized, what I said may not be a normal expectation I clarified, this is what I do with my normal barber.  Now he asks me to go back to the waiting area while I figure out what I want. I’m uncomfortable and just leave.

I understand that it is a kind gesture, and I do appreciate what she is doing, but I feel like if it was really ""for"" or ""about"" me, she would have paid attention the past many years when I've expressed what I really like to do on my birthday. I'm also a fairly ""homebody"" type person, so a party about me is already giving my some anxiety. I can be more extroverted, but even then I usually have to wake up that morning in the right mood to be around that many people.

bx4q5p	2019-06-05 16:41:33	haileyeuropethrowawa	WIBTA if I go on a trip to Europe with my ex-boyfriend and the girl with whom he cheated on me (way more complex than I can put in title).	"using a throwaway since my ex knows my regular reddit. 

Way back-ground: last fall my ex-boyfriend and purchased a European trip through a student travel company. Full on planned to fly on the same flights, we were going to camp, overnight Euro-rail and hostel but we did book a couple nights in airbnbs and a really cool old hotel in Switzerland. 

In April I caught him cheating red handed. I mean I didn't catch him in the act but I saw some texts from a girl we know then saw her coming out of his apartment in a total walk of shame of moment at like 5AM as I was stopping by to bring him breakfast before I started my clinical that day. He still denies it but now that are dating, so yeah...deny all you want asshole. 

So at first he told me he wasn't going to Europe and I was like fine I'll go by myself. My dad offered to help me out with the more expensive places to stay so I was all set to go. Then my ex thought he could bully me out of going by buying his new girlfriend tickets on all the same flights then insisting I change the reservations on the hotels and Airbnb to his name. 

At first I thought it would just be too awkward so I tried to return or change my flights and it was just such a pain in the ass I got frustrated and hung up. Then last week, I had an epiphany that I didn't mess anything up and I should not have to be the one to both miss out and incur extra expense at the last minute to change stuff. I'm going. 

Ex is so pissed at me. He says that he'll pay for my ticket changes and that me being on the same flight as them is going to make it so awkward for him (as far as I know our seats are still together and I'm not moving mine...good luck to him) and that the ""nicer"" thing is to change my ticket since he would have to change two tickets instead of just one. He asked what to do about the hotel and I said well that's a no go but since the Airbnb's are two room he and his new girl can sublet from me. This made him so furious that I thought he was going to punch the wall of my apartment. 

I will openly admit after him being such a jerk, part of me is really wanting to make him suffer through the awkwardness and yes I'm being vindictive and thus maybe I'm being an asshole.

bx4pd6	2019-06-05 16:39:43	pokdnnf	AITAH for expecting to be paid back in full by sister-in-law, and not in payments for a loan to pay for college classes.	"My wife’s sister is a college student that works 2 part time jobs, and goes to school. She hasn’t gotten paid, and needs to pay for a college class by today. My wife just told me that we need to let her borrow $350 by today to pay for her class. I was bothered by this because she didn’t even ask me, she just told me that her sister needed the money and would pay us back next week. I told my wife that we can let her borrow the money, but I don’t want to be paid back in payments. I want the full amount next week. Her sister says she can only pay us half next week, and the the other half, a week later. I really can’t say no because I’ll look like an ass. My wife is already upset at me because she thinks I’m being an asshole for expecting her sister, who works part time, and goes to school, to pay us back in full when she gets paid.  I understand that she needs the money, and her part time jobs aren’t cutting it. However, I do see her buying lots of make up, and other non-necessities, so I’m not sure if this is a budgeting problem for her, or if she’s just not making enough money problem. If she’s working 2 part time jobs, I would imagine that she should have budgeted her finances knowing that today was a deadline to pay for classes. Deadlines are not something that appear out the blue, and surely, there was some indication that this expense was coming. 

Admittedly, we do make good money, and this loan probably won’t hurt us, but it’s the principle of the matter that bothers me. We recently had a large expense that took half of our savings account. I’m now wanting to build it back up by stuffing it with as much money as I can. I work in an unstable company, and don’t feel comfortable with the measly savings that we have.

bx4opo	2019-06-05 16:38:16	ListenRetard	AITA for Using Coupon Codes Multiple Times?	"Recently, I've been making a lot of food delivery purchases from apps such as UberEats, Postmates, DoorDash, etc.

If you're someone who uses these services, you know they always have some sort of coupon code or deal that gives a few dollars for an order. Usually it's like 5 dollars off of a 15 dollar purchase, free delivery, or something like that. Taking advantage of these deals are usually the only times I actually do order food delivery, because I'm not generally willing to pay 4 dollars for the delivery, a 3-4 dollar tip and a 10% service fee on top of all that.

This gets us to the part where I'm questioning if I am indeed the asshole... 

I have probably 2 accounts for each of these services, and can easily keep track of which coupon codes I've used (they usually expire after a few days, so I'm not keeping a spreadsheet or anything like that). More along the lines of: ""Hey, a 5$ coupon off my next delivery, cool,"" and then I just remember the code.

My coworkers made me question my motivation for doing this and the best answer I can think of as my reason is that: Saving a few bucks makes getting the delivery worth it and the coupon code money is already accounted for. These companies expect x amount of coupon codes to be used and have accounted for it accordingly. Also, (as far as I know...) the restaurant isn't being screwed out of the money, nor is the driver. That means that the company is sending out these coupon codes expecting to take the coupon code loss.

They (coworkers) seem to think that because I use these codes more than the allotted _exactly_ one time, I'm an asshole. They say that there is not much different between what I do, and something like walking into a restaurant that has an order pick-up line and just take the pre-purchased food (because the place expects some loss.) They also likened it to being no different than finding someone's credit card on the floor and using it (again, because the companies have insurance for unauthorized purchases etc.)

I see a big issue with both of these examples, and wouldn't ever participate in either. It seems like there's a big difference between credit card fraud and using a one-time-only coupon multiple times.

bx4mw9	2019-06-05 16:34:06	LocalParticular	AITA for refusing to help in the kitchen like the men of my family?	"I just created this account because my cousin uses Reddit, I think. I apologize for my broken English because it is not my mother tongue.

So, I (Female) have a big family who gather mostly on Sundays to have lunch together. Since I was a child I am used to do nothing while I wait for my meal, maybe just playing with my other cousins or something. Meanwhile, my grandma, my aunts, my cousins and my mother cook the meals/do the dishes/clean the floor/whatever. I never cared until I grew up and started to notice this behavior...

The men in my family (uncles, in laws and cousins) come to my grandma's house and just sit on the couch, watching TV, talking about stuff, drinking beers and pretty much doing NOTHING while the women cook and prepare lunch in the kitchen and basically do all the work. To make things worse, they all have this habit to give the first plates of food to the men and then the last of them plates to the women, so they (men) can eat first. Why? Well, because my grandma was taught that way, that she should have the food ready for when the men arrive tired from work. And she taught the same way to my aunts and my mom.

As I started to understand why things were the way they are, I decided not doing the same and, if my uncles and cousins can stay in the couch doing nothing, I will be doing the same damn thing because it doesn't feel fair, to be honest but I never said anything or complaint and nobody said something to me, either.

The thing is that last Sunday we were in my grandma’s house as usual, but my uncles arrived sooner, and my cousin said that he was really hungry and that he had to be in the gym by 14:00 so my aunts, mom and grandma were in the kitchen overwhelmed because they had nothing done yet. I was in the couch watching TV like it was not my problem, like my uncles and cousin, because if they don't move, I don't move.

As my mom was setting the first plates of food to my uncles, she saw me doing nothing and she just said ''well, you don't even go to help? Can't you see how overwhelmed we are in the kitchen?'' And then I just said out loud in front of all of them ''why should I be the only one helping? There are 4 more people besides me in this room, you know?'' She then just shut up, looked at me and went back to the kitchen. None of my uncles and cousin said nothing they just kept staring at the TV or at their phones like they were not there.

I felt terrible. Not for them, just for my mom. She didn’t say nothing at that moment because it would be like admitting that just because I am a woman I'm expected to be in the kitchen and they all know how sexist is that.

I don't feel like apologizing because I am not going to be a ''waitress'' to my uncles and I'm not planning to change my attitude until they (the men) change theirs. But I also feel bad for my grandma, my aunts, my cousins and my mom because I'm refusing to help them in the kitchen.

bx4mkh	2019-06-05 16:33:19	wtfhappenedpls	WIBTA if I ask an ex-friend about potential childhood trauma?	"I (23 F) was at a party recently where an ex-friend attended. We havent talked since we had a falling out at around 14. I'm way over it and I hold no grudges against her, it was mostly awkward and we just went on pretending the other didn't exist.

The thing is though, when I saw her I suddenly remember times from when we were friends that is, frankly, quite gross.

Our friendship started at around 7 years old and mostly it was great. There were moments that really stood out though.

Examples are: 

she'd ask her dad for a ""tv kiss"" and they'd make out in front of me. 

At sleepovers she'd occationally go on rants about fucking and sex 

I have a distinct memory of him lifting my bed covers and staring at me in the middle of the night

I had completly forgotten about all this until i saw her. The thing is, I went crazy between 15-16 and I don't really trust my mind as a result and all these COULD be false memories.

I want to ask her about this but either I have false memories and I'm accusing her dad of something really serious or they are true and I'm stirring up some really nasty memories for her.

I just really want to know the truth, but maybe it isnt my place to ask?

I have second lunch, while they have third. Now the other day I had to take a test for make-up work, so I had to go to third lunch. I knew these friends would be in this period, and I have no other friends in third period, so I planned to sit with them. 

Now these friends sit at an 8 person round table, which is fine for them on any normal day, but it did not have enough seats for me to sit with them. I suggested we moved to one of the open tables (there were many) which could fit us all, but everyone refused. They suggested I either kneel on the floor, or sit somewhere else. For most of lunch I had to eat by myself at another table, and then I hovered around the table as soon as I finished eating. 

So now I am wondering if that was unfair of me to demand that we move from that table for the day, or if it was a perfectly fine suggestion.

I had just graduated college and been out for about 6-8 months. I was looking for entry level accounts payable positions. I applied to a local dentist chain and was called in for an interview. I arrived about 10 minutes early and checked in with the secretary. During the interview process, I was always punctual and the extra few minutes gave me a little time to relax before hand. So I went to wait in the waiting room. There was no one else there.

About half an hour goes by and I hadn't been called in. Frankly I was getting a little irked and asked the secretary if I was still scheduled. She called someone and told me they would be out momentarily. Another 15 minutes or so goes by and a couple of employees greet me walking by as I'm sitting down. I smile and politely greet them back. 

Not long after, the secretary takes me to a conference room. Those people who greeted me moments prior were running the interview process. They started to inquire about my background and ask typical interview questions. They had a copy of my resume but the way they were asking questions made me believe they were just reading it for the first time.

I don't remember the exact exchange but they asked some question about why I was interested in working for their company and I politely responded by saying I don't think I'll be pursuing a career at the company based on how they handled my interview. I said it was okay that they were late (sometimes shit happens) but to not even keep me posted and just leave me hanging felt unprofessional. And when I mentioned that it seems like my resume hadn't even been looked at before that meeting they just sat there stone-faced like I told the truth. I told them to have a nice day and I left.

I had some meh interviews before but I felt like their behavior told me all I needed to know about the company. WITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Around 8 years ago my step dad helped me get my first vehicle, he worked at a tow yard and his boss agreed to not only give me the truck for $800, but hire me that summer to work it off. My step dad has helped me work on it since and it's been a good truck. 

It's a late 90s Silverado with 170k miles on it currently. 

Flash forward to today, I moved out of his house long ago, and I got my first new car last week. I mentioned that I'd like to keep the truck in the family because of its sentimental value. 

He took this as me offering it to him for free. He was planning on coming this weekend to pick it up, so I texted him and asked if $800 was doable, as I'd just put new tires and registered the truck ($580 total), plus I thought it was kind of cool to pass it off for the same crazy low price tag.

This really upset him and he basically just said to forget it. 

That's the gist of it. For the record this truck would sell for roughly triple on Craigslist.

bx4ewv	2019-06-05 16:15:51	thethrowaway48	AITA for calling out someone who kept asking for pictures of me.	"So to start off, somewhat recently I posted a picture on a rating sub and got a private message in return. It was someone telling me how they admired fitness and wanted pictures of me flexing and shit. I didn’t really mind so I sent him a few but he kept just asking  for different angles and more and more intimate pictures. Getting a little bit suspicious I snooped around on his profile and learned that he’s gay.

The next day when he started asking for more I asked him about his true intentions, but also since it didn’t really bother me even though I’m straight, and let him know that if he told me his true intentions i would be fine with sending him more pictures. From there he played dumb and told me he had no idea what I was talking about, so I got a little bit annoyed and asked again and then he instantly got defensive and used a manipulation tactic which made me stop wanting to talk to him. 

My question here is, am I the asshole for just assuming that because he’s gay he must have wanted the pictures for personal gain? He tried to convince me it was just because he admires fitness but the amount of pictures he asked for really just threw me off."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx4etk	2019-06-05 16:15:39		AITA for wanting to put our cat down?	"So I know this is conterversial but I've been insisting my parents put down our older cat.

The cat is 10 yrs old, and that is somewhat young for a cat, but he had been bleeding from his nose for 1-2 months and drooling so we had taken him to the vet (Pretty Late since it wasn't that bad when it started and we didn't have the money at the time to take him and I do feel bad for that). However, by then they told us that he had a huge lump under his tongue  that could be an infection or cancerous on top of a upper respiratory infection. They told us the only way we could tell would be to perform a biopsy which is way too expensive for us, but we decided to try to save up. Fast forward to now, he is still sick and my parents say they can't afford to treat him. I understand and I'm still trying to get a job at 16 which can sometimes be difficult.  He is much worse and can barely eat but still goes on and sneezes blood. I told my parents that he is suffering and since it's looking cancerous due to him not gaining weight/loosing fur/etc we should put him down. I take care of him and see how much he suffers, however, my dad specifically says we should let him pass naturally as it would be killing him to put him down. He believed that the cat wants to survive. 

And I understand him as it would be painful to lose him, but he just suffers so much. He's an animal, it's instinct to survive even if they might not want to, isn't it? I'm not exactly sure. I wish I could tell what he wanted personally but we can't, so I believe it would be right to let him be laid to rest since he is going to die a painful death if he keeps going on this road. 

However, my father disagrees with me completely even if there is nothing we can do to make his life better but feed  and be around him.

I kept insisting my opinion but my father believes we would be killing him. 

Im starting to think that I would just be killing an animal that wants to live and that would be wrong in my book, so am I the asshole for insisting we put him down?

Sorry to bother you with my problem in advance but I've just had his on my mind for awhile."		1	0
bx4ej4	2019-06-05 16:15:01		AITA over Bridesmaids and MOH handling?	"Several years ago, when my fiance and I got engaged, I waited a while before I selected a group of friends as bridesmaids who I each had a personal connection with, but they did not necessarily have friendships with each other. I decided to not have a MoH, as I felt I didn't need one, nor did I want to hurt anyone's feelings.

Fast forward to the wedding date quickly approaching, and I am swamped with wedding stuff. I work full time, go to school part/full time, and do not live in the area where I'm getting married. One of my bridesmaids asked me weekly where she could help me out, etc. I realized it would be nice to hand off some stuff to my her and clear my plate a little bit. I also was hesitant to ask my other bridesmaids to do things for me, because I don't want to burden anybody. I agonized for several weeks over whether or not I should just make this bridesmaid my MoH, and after some family urging, I asked her to be my MoH. She said yes, and I instantly felt relieved.

However, this may have been my mistake. I didn't want anyone's feelings to be hurt, or make it seem like she was my bestest friend, so I didn't say anything to anybody (besides my mom, fiance, and MoH). My MoH and I had a face to face discussion that I see her equally with all of my other bridesmaids, and that I appreciated her willingness and availability to help me with my big wedding. I was concerned that another one of my bridesmaids would be upset that she wasn't my MoH, and that was part of the decision to not say anything. I didn't want anyone to think that I made this decision because of a personal relationship. Any of them could've been my MoH, but this one person has been in weddings, always offered to help, and brought up things that I hadn't thought about. I love her dearly, as I do the rest of my friends.

After a get together recently, the bridesmaid I worried would be upset found out that I had made someone a MoH, and she was devastated. I tried consoling her, telling her that I honestly wanted to not burden her already busy and hectic schedule with more busy work, and that this did not reflect our relationship or that our relationship was less than anyone elses. I told her I agonized about the choice for weeks and hadn't considered a MoH until I became swamped with things, and that I should've told everybody sooner and I am sorry for not doing so. She seemed to understand, so we hugged it out.

The next day, however, she told me she felt betrayed, blind-sided, and that she would no longer be coming to my wedding. I tried to tell her once again that the decision was not made personally, that I love her, and I wish she would come to my wedding but that I could not make her.

Since then, she's refused to text me back and I think has blocked me on several forms of communication.

Needless to say, I'm pretty shocked, devastated, and confused. Am I the asshole? And if so, how do I fix this? Is this fixable?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

I just recently graduated from a medical program similar to nursing. I don’t want to be too specific because I’m fairly certain some of these people are on Reddit. This class gives you a diploma for completing coursework and clinical procedures and passing the class exams but you still need to sit for a licensing/certification exam which is very difficult. 

There was a girl in my class I’ll call Annie. Annie was never prepared, never studied, got all of her class work and homework done by copying from friends in class, and just generally used the class to screw around (I’ll elaborate if anyone is interested). Annie also failed the final exam the first time around and if not for the instructor helping her, wouldn’t have passed the class for her diploma. Annie was overheard by a friend of mine (Kelly) stating that she was just going to tell people that she was the equivalent of a higher level medical practitioner that what we actually are (for example, telling people she was a heart surgeon when she was really an MD with no residency/fellowship—not this exactly; again for anonymity purposes) and that if interviewers asked that Annie would say she was certified because she had a diploma. Kelly told Annie that was illegal and fraudulent. 

Needless to say, Annie got a job right away and yes she did tell the interviewer that she was licensed/certified. Annie also told another friend Pattie that it wasn’t necessary for her to take the exam because hey she got a job without it. But that’s because she TOLD the interviewer she had it! Every person I’ve spoken to and phone interviews I’ve had, they all said: we are very interested...get back in touch after your certification exam. And not just me others in our class too. 

I spoke with Pattie and after talking to me, she told Annie flat out: Annie, you’re committing fraud by telling people you’re certified/licensed when you’re not. Annie has no intention or interest in rectifying the situation so my question is WIBTA if I called HR at her job and told them to check the certification/license of their new hires?

bx4de3	2019-06-05 16:12:19	SoosiePoosie	WIBTA if I kicked out my roommate and brother who's relapsed back on to heroin because I don't like living with him, knowing that it most likely will lead to a worse situation?	"Some background... I am 30f, I have 2 older brothers (one is 33, the ex/relapsed heroin addict, and the other is 36).

2 years ago I bought a flat with my eldest brother. Our Dad died when I was 20 and it was revealed when I was 28 that there was some money available for me to use so I chose to invest the money into a flat that I co-bought with my eldest brother.

I lived with the eldest brother for a year. It was awful. He was horrid to me and I couldn't tolerate his treatment anymore. Too long to explain how and why, not massively relevant to my WIBTA question, but relevant enough to include so that you get that, generally, I have had a shit time with the men in my family. So it was decided that he'd move in his new girlfriend.

My other brother, addict bro, asked to move in to take his place. I was really hesitant, I have a very strained/unfair relationship with addict bro. He is not a positive or social person at all.

Because a lot of the money used to buy the flat was family/Dads money it didn't seem fair to say no to him when I didn't have another option for a roomie at that point. Besides, 'addict bro' had been progressing well/better in life in recent years, had started a good well-paid career, made some good progress all around and my flat was closer to where he works.

After a couple of relatively normal months of living with me, it became obvious that he relapsed. All the old signs are there: he's got into money troubles, he's inexplicably lost weight, he does the absolute bare minimum in general, he doesn't do any cleaning, gives me shitty attitude if I ask him for the most basic of things.. it's just fucking horrible for me and not what I need or deserve.

I feel trapped because kicking him out at this point would very very likely mean he'll spiral further into money and heroin-related problems - which is what happened when my parents kicked him out when he was 20. So in that sense, it is better for him to be in my flat where he can be seen and helped by someone in the family than to be living with strangers.

I don't feel like I'm an asshole for WANTING to kick him out, but would I be the asshole to actually go through with it assuming that the outcome of doing so is highly likely to mean more serious problems to deal with?

Put it this way, the effects of me tolerating living with him would be much less severe than what he's capable of doing as an out of control heroin addict...so would I be an asshole by kicking him out?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

When I opened the door, I saw her crying over her kitten, which was bleeding and was convulsing. It was in a very bad state and it looked as if someone had stepped on it and broke its skull. 

Because Teenage Neighbour’s parents weren’t home, I offered to drive her and the kitten to the vet although there was a thunderstorm outside. 

At the vet, the vet told us that there was maybe a 50-50 chance the kitten would survive. The bill was about USD500 for the surgery, and the kitten would likely need medication costing about USD30 a day. 

Teenage Neighbour called her parents, and I spoke to her parents who said they would leave it up to me to make the decision. 

I spoke to the vet and we agreed there was a high probability the kitten would be disabled even if it survived this. 

I then told Teenage Neighbour it may be kinder to put the kitten to sleep. She smiled, nodded, and signed the euthanasia waiver forms. 

After we told the vet to put the kitten to sleep, Teenage Neighbour looked at me and told me “Tomorrow, when the kitten wakes up, maybe we can take it to a different vet.” Turns our she didn’t know putting the kitten to sleep meant ETERNAL SLEEP. 

Anyways, after explaining to her it meant killing the kitten, and after a lot of bawling on her part, she finally decided to put the kitten to sleep. 

When it came time to pay the bill (40 USD), Teenage Neighbour looks at me and tells me she has no money. She asks me to pay first and her parents would reimburse me. 

It’s now been nearly a week since we put the kitten down. Teenage Neighbour and her parents have not come to reimburse me. I live 5 steps away from them. 

WITBA if I knocked on their door to ask them for reimbursement? I don’t need the money, and I know it’s the neighbourly thing to do, but it irks me that they (Teenage Neighbour and her parents) didn’t even thank me for what I did.

Basically, I don’t feel comfortable sharing information about much of anything about my life with her because she has a history of using the information against me. Which is why, usually if I plan to invite friends over for dinner parties or just to hang out, I would rather she not be around. I try to mitigate this by mostly only inviting friends over when I know she’s going to be away for the weekend or something. 

Otherwise, she’ll usually hang around when my friends are over and it makes it very awkward for me. Usually she’ll go to the next room but even then I’m a little uncomfortable with that. Worse, sometimes she’ll SIT AT THE SAME TABLE and join the conversation. 

I just feel like these are my friends and my time with my friends. Her being around makes it difficult for me to truly be myself around my friends. For example, I identify as queer and I’m pretty open about it with my friends but I haven’t come out to her yet. I just feel so stifled like I have to watch what I say around my friends when she’s around. 

I’ve tried suggesting to her to maybe go out for the night with her friends or something when I invite my friends over but that didn’t go down too well with her because apparently I’m being “ungrateful” and “ashamed of her” for even suggesting that. Also, she loves to point out I’m the one still staying in her house (in all fairness, I’ve also tried suggesting I move out for various reasons other than this and she was pretty upset about that suggestion too).

So, I live in an apartment complex that has banned smoking in the apartments but allows smoking on the balconies and in common areas. I'm not a heavy smoker but I do enjoy it and probably smoke like 5-10 cigarettes a day depending.

My *direct* neighbours on all sides are not smokers and have the habit of leaving all their windows open (all day and night).

I live on the fourth floor, so walking downstairs every time I want a smoke seems like an unfair burden just to be 'polite'.

I have the *right* to do so, but it still feels like an asshole move. My question: am I the asshole for smoking directly below a neighbour's open window? Part of me feels gross for doing it, but part of me also figures that ""that's life"" and if they don't like it they can just close their windows or pass a policy banning smoking in the common areas.

edit: thank you to the people concerned with my health. I've quit before and intend to again, but as anyone with a nicotine addiction could tell you: relapses happen."	Asshole	0	0
bx496s	2019-06-05 16:02:33	Meerkitkats	AITA for letting my teenage daughter date but not my son because of maturity differences?	"My household is falling apart due to this. My husband is trying to pick up the pieces but my son isn’t talking to me. I know reddit has a younger crowd so looking for opinions wherever I can get them. 

So I have two teenage kids very close in age, 15M and 14F. Being their mom I know exactly what they’re like, what they need, and what kind of parenting they respond to. My son is very social and extroverted, which is great, but he’s also got poor impulse control and is easily distracted. His grades are mediocre and I’m just worried about how he’ll focus and go on to a good college. 

My daughter is like the exact opposite, more like me, where she is more introverted and academic. She’s never had any problems with school work and the only thing I’m concerned with is her circle of friends that’s always changing or falling apart. She doesn’t have nearly as many friends as my son. 

The issue: a few months ago my son told us he wanted to date a girl (we have rules in our household about dating before 18). So he wanted to negotiate with us about 1) bringing the girl over after school and 2) having longer curfews. Knowing him, I set a few requirements. For the next semester he had to improve his average grades from a B- to B+ or A, he can’t break curfew even once, and he had to pick up more chores (mostly just cleaning his room and basement rooms, which he uses the most). He agreed but ended up breaking curfew 3-4 times, so I said no. He was upset and I’m sure still seeing this girl but he can’t bring her over and his curfew is the same as before. 

Now last week my daughter came home and told us very excitedly that there’s a boy in her Gifted history class who wants to take her on a movie date, so she needs curfew extended to 11pm. I said yes on the spot. My reasoning was solid. She’s always been responsible with curfew (she rarely goes out at night) and her grades are already high. I upped her allowance a bit and wished her good luck. Since then her new boyfriend has been round the house and husband and I wholeheartedly approve. 

But now my son is lashing out over the “injustice” despite how many times I’ve tried to explain my reasoning. I truly believe he cannot have a girlfriend and be responsible with his biggest responsibilities. I told him his sister, despite her age, is more mature than he is likely due to both personality and perhaps gender (girls mature earlier than boys) and that it’s not a punishment for him. I’m just trying to do the best parenting for both of them based on their own aptitudes. 

AITA for this decision? My husband stands by me but my son has sworn he HATES me, which is pretty standard teenager behavior but still. I’ve never seen him so hateful and it is making me doubt things.

**EDIT:** I’m sorry but anyone who’s an actual parent of teenage boys and girls would agree with me that girls mature faster than boys. It’s hardly sexism when it’s your own children and you see them everyday and know what they’re like because you raised them from birth.

Now if you want to respond to the rest of my post then I’m all ears.

**Last edit**: Ok I’ve read everyone’s responses and I’m going to digest it. I get that I’m the big bad right now but I can’t help but wonder if a lot of people will understand me better when they have kids, especially teenaged kids. Don’t get me wrong, I love them both but you know what I get frustrated too. I’m human too. My son is hard to discipline and sometimes I just want to blow off steam even if that means posting on the internet. I don’t think that makes me a bad mom, just a human being who wants the best for her kids."	Asshole	0	0
bx492c	2019-06-05 16:02:17	Correct_Parfait	AITA for for how I spent my birthday?	" This happened back in January. The situation was recently brought back to my attention, so I came to ask the coveted question.

 OK, so, 21st birthday. people always have high expectations for that, my friends included. Several of my friends wanted me to hang out and essentially, from what I understood, party for 24 hours. I told them all that I don't like to party on my birthday. For the last several years I've spent that day alone. A couple of them seemed miffed, while the others murdered my inbox and doorstep trying to change my mind up until the day.

 Here's the issue. I spent *most* of the day alone. I have one friend that I don't talk to that much, because he had moved out of state. He called me up and told me that he was in town at his mother's house, and invited me over for a late dinner. it was nice and we had wonderful evening. As my other friends found out, several of them went LC for a while. My cousin and another friend have gone NC all together. When I finally wrangled info out of one of them, I was told that I was an asshole, and had blown them off. Another friend in a private conversation even went as far as to question our friendship.

bx48ny	2019-06-05 16:01:24	CharlesXIl	AITA for telling my step-sister I resent her for my mother's death ?	"4 months ago I came home from college to find my mother dirty, and completely lost. She forgot I was coming home and that I called her 40 minutes before for telling her I was getting close to home. 
I took her to ER that night, and after a scan, they found a giant aneurism of 40mm on 25mm, which caused hydrocephalic. They operated the hydrocephalic, she then had a drain, and after two weeks, they ""kicked"" her out of the hospital even trough the aneurism still had to be operated.

She couldn't stay alone, and no center of revalidation could take her while waiting for the operation because they did not have the stuff to monitor the aneurism. 
So my brother, my sister and I decided to do shifts.

My mother had an appointment to do a scan and get an appointment to have the aneurism closed. I should have come home the day before, but my sister called me and told me it was ok for her to stay one more day, and that I should stay in the city and meet them the next day at the hospital. 
I was woke up by a phone call to my brother in the morning, telling me my sister had found my mom laying on the ground. She fell from the sofa. She was brung to the hospital in a coma, and stayed in intensive care for four days before passing off. 

My sisters apologized many times, and I always tried to protect her, saying she shouldn't feel guilty, and it wasn't her fault at all. She told me many time that that night, she heard a noise at 11pm and did not go to check it out because she thought it was her dog. That she thinks maybe her dog pushed my mother off the sofa, and that, this night, she kind of cared more about her dog that had been sick and at the vet for the past 4 days. 
She asked me multiple time how I felt about this and if I resented her for what happened, and I could never have said that I did.

Three days ago, we got really drunk, and at 4am, she asked me once again. I totally lost my shit and threw everything in her face. How I fell guilty not having been there that night, the fact that SHE told me to stay where I was and enjoy when she wasn't feeling like watching for my mother because of her dog. The fact that she could have done something if she went to see what was that noise. I feel relieved, and shitty at the same time because I must have been really hard for her to ear.

Yesterday, I received a message from her telling me I'm really selfish, that she spent difficult time thinking about this, and most of all, that while I won’t apologize my brother (Who didn't call to tell me this or to talk about what happened) will refuse to sell the house we inherited. 
I feel like they once again treat me like a child, like you would refuse to give a lollipop to a kid if he won't say ""hello"" to the lady next door. 

I don't feel like I should apologize, and what they did by blackmailing me with the heritage makes me want to give them a big middle finger and tell them to fuck off for good."	Asshole	0	0
bx48e3	2019-06-05 16:00:51	moonmeetsun	AITA for asking to see a portfolio before letting a family member take my headshot photo?	"Background: I'm a working actor and I need a new headshot photo. The photographer that I worked with before charges $300 for a 1-hour session (which compared to other photogs in my city... is not bad. Most others charge $500)

I asked my dad to help split it with me. He called back a couple days later and said that he had reached out to two people willing to do it for free.

1) A family friend we used to live next door to. From what I remember, she mostly did concert photography. But her daughter is an actor, a model and was in pageants, so I trust that she knows what to look for in terms of headshots (she might have actually taken her daughter's headshots??? I'll have to ask..)

2) my grandma's new husband's daughter. I've literally only seen her at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Yeah. That's all i have to describe her lol.

My first instinct was to just immediately go for the family friend, but I figured reaching out to the husband's daughter would be a nice way to welcome her to the family and get to know her.

After getting her phone number from my Grandma, I asked to see her portfolio and if she has experience with headshots.

She got immediately offended and accused me of not trusting her, being all like ""I know what I'm doing"", ""i've been doing photography for years"", ""i'm doing you a favor"", blah blah.

Then she told her dad and my Grandma and now my Grandma is blowing up my phone saying that I hurt her feelings and that 'family should come first', all this stuff.

My dad tried to defend me by saying that i'm looking at other options and that it makes sense for me to want to see a portfolio (bless his heart). This made Grandma even more upset and now she's accusing my dad and I of not being accepting of her husband's family.

And bc she's a Facebook Grandma, now the whole fam is in our business and taking sides on the issue.

(And after all this, I still have yet to see a goddamn portfolio???? I found her instagram... Nice selfies but nothing that says anything about her professional quality.)

AITA here?? I thought I was being reasonable but now I'm questioning myself. I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, I just thought I was being professional

EDIT: Because people are getting confused... I did not reach out to her myself. Nor did I ask my dad to reach out to her. He did that entirely of his own volition. 

I already had a photographer that I wanted. I just asked for him to split the cost, not for him to go searching for another photographer. He decided by himself to talk to her.

I only considered her, bc I wanted to be nice and give her a chance. Also, he didn't ask her to do it for free. She offered. She set that price. No one told her to do it for free. 

And for those asking ""what's the harm?"":
The photos may be free, but I still have to pay for hair, makeup and transportation. Not to mention, finding the time between two jobs and an intensive rehearsal schedule. One doesn't just walk into a studio photo-ready and take photos in 30 seconds. It takes time, effort, and preparation from all participants involved.

Why waste the time and money on a photo session with her if she's not a good fit? Especially when I can use that time on an actual professional?

TL;DR - I need a new headshot photo, a distant family member offered to do it for free. I asked to see her portfolio and it hurt her feelings."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx47wu	2019-06-05 15:59:52	o_lanturn	AITA if I omit my group member’s name from an assignment?	"For context, we are in a second year university course, the assignment is worth 20% of the final grade and we have had around 2 months to do it 

My group partner is also an acquaintance/friend who I have a number of mutual friends with, which is what I think makes this situation slightly more difficult. 

We mutually decided that he/she would do part 1 of the assignment, and I would do part 2 (equal workload) - the entire assignment should be ~4500 words, not including appendices, graphs, tables etc. Around a week and a bit before the assignment is due, they send me ~700 words and 4 tables of data telling me they will write more later, but can’t at the moment due to ‘writer’s block’.  I don’t really read what they’ve done, but it looks good I tell them to write more later if they can. 

Come 5 days before the assignment is due and I’m ready to compile the two parts, I finally read what they’ve sent me and it is basically unusable - parts of it are basically ripped straight from wikipedia, the English is very broken despite them it being their first language, and the analysis is very basic/wrong in some areas. I ask them again if they’ve done more and they say ‘no, sorry, I couldn’t write any more’.  So I rewrite the entirety of part 1, use about 200 of the 700 words they sent and none of the tables.

Admittedly, I didn’t pester them, and neither of us met the deadlines we set for ourselves - I did both parts of the assignment within the past week (diamonds are made under pressure haha). However, I did go find them at least 3 times in person to discuss the assignment, but they had made little to no effort corresponding with me. They were also at a party the night they told me they couldn’t write any more. 

I’ve spoken to my subject tutor about this, who told me they would completely omit their partner’s name from the assignment if this happened to them, but I’ve also asked my friends, one of which said ‘ask them to do part 2 of the assignment, even if it’s bad and unusable, you’re still giving them a chance to do more work - it’s a bit unjustified to just given them a 0’. I haven’t contacted my group partner about this, but I think if they actually cared about their grade they would have done more/better or reached out to me more, and am leaning more towards not putting their name on the assignment (unless this decreases my marks because it was meant to be a ‘group assignment’).  However, they may have a hard time passing the course with a 0, but it won’t give them an automatic fail.

AITA if I omit their name given the circumstances?

TL;DR: group partner who is also a friend/acquaintance makes no effort for an assignment, does ~5% but may have a hard time passing the course if I omit their name from the assignment."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So I am a kind person who almost never gets overly angry/takes my anger out on people. I was with my bf, his friend and my friend in an urban exploration area we were walking around. I never met his friend until this day and I realized quickly that he was a nice guy but pretty immature and all over the place(probably undiagnosed ADHD to describe it). During our time there he was acting up and at one point jumped out from behind somewhere and startled me for a second and went on to brag about how much he scared me etc, which at this point he had already been acting super immature and annoying and loud and obnoxious prior to this so I had asked if he would stop, I was not rude about it. Before I continue further, I want to make it clear that my friend also made note of his behavior to me that he seemed to act like a child. We were walking down a staircase, my bfs friend and him having both the flash lights because they were leading the way. All of the sudden the flashlights go out and I immediately know what was going on. He took his and my bfs flashlight and turned it off, my bf was unaware of what exactly was about to happen. I call out and say ""can you please not I really do not want to be scared,"" so I stand there for a second and turn the corner and his friend jumps out freaking me the hell out and I then say a lot of colorful words that I usually do not say. Something along the lines of ""If you keep doing that I AM FUCKING LEAVING. You are fucking annoying and acting immature."" He then goes on to say that I am being defensive and asks if thats my defense mechanism and then I said ""you are being a fucking dick."" If you asked anyone who knows me they would tell you that I am NOTHING like that. I literally would never talk to someone in that way unless they absolutely deserved it,which I guess in this case he did but I ended up feeling terrible as soon as it happened. I immediately apologized and told him that I was not a bitch and that I was sorry for using that language since I am not that type of person. My bf told me later that night that he had apologized to my boyfriend for doing it. He knows to this day how bad I felt about it because my boyfriend told him I was sorry, AND his friend said sorry. Basically the problem is resolved and we both apologized to each other but it just eats me up knowing I treated someone this way when I am in no ways that kind of person. I guess I kind of answered my own question but I just want to know if I am truly a bad person for this because then I can just let it go.

"In 2 weeks it will be grad week at my highschool, and they have a theme you can dress up as for everyday of the week. One of the themes is 'animated', where you basically dress up as any animated character.

My friends decided that they'd do a group costume and dress up as the Teen Titans. They did all this in a group chat, which I was a part of. But, I was away from my phone and not part of the planning. 

One of my friends orders (pretty cheap) costumes/parts of costumes that we couldn't DIY. When I pick up my phone the next day, I figure out that was decided for me that I would be Starfire. No problem, I'm not picky. I ask my friend about the costumes and she says she ordered a costume for me. She sends a picture. The costume had an insanely short skirt and crop top.

The issue here is that I'm Christian.

I can't wear anything that shows any stomach or thighs, and all of my friends know this. I sent something along the lines of 'you and I both know I can't wear this'. 

All of my friends immediately got SUPER mad. Like, unreasonably mad over a costume. They kept yelling that I should just 'wear it anyway' and 'it's not a big deal'.

Last week I had major surgery on my jaw. My mum and sister have been amazing during my recovery, but last night my mum talked to me about how upset it made her when I wouldn't allow her into my room while I was in hospital and I know that sounds really shitty, but please hear me out.

When I woke up from surgery, I asked if they called my mum. They said yes, and they would tell her when I was moved to a room so she could visit me. After about an hour I was finally moved to a room. I was confused because after my last surgery I was put on a ward but they told me that I'm a carrier of MRSA so I needed my own room. My brain was a little foggy so the mention of MRSA terrified me and as soon as I got my belongings back, I called my mum to tell her to please hurry because I was starting to worry. She said she'll come as soon as she's finished work so I think, fair enough, and ended up falling asleep. 

I woke up later when a nurse came to check my blood pressure and I asked her if she's seen my mum. She says no, but visiting hours are over now anyway. I check my phone and the only messages I had were from my nan, my sister and some friends. I didn't even bother calling my mum and went back to sleep because I figured she finished late and couldn't make visiting hours. Next morning she texted me asking how I was. I didn't answer the question I just asked if she'll be coming up today and she said she'd come later because her fiance was feeling unwell and she was at home with him. Well, as you could probably imagine (or not, I don't know) I felt a bit jealous. She was at home with him because he wasn't feeling very well but I was stuck in the hospital after major surgery on my own.

4pm came around and still no sign of her but my nan bought my sister and 2 best friends up in her car which cheered me up. My nan and sister soon had to leave but my friends stayed and said they'd get the train back. A while later, a nurse came in and told my friends that they had to leave because visiting hours were nearly over and my mum was waiting to come in (you can only have 2 visitors at a time). I told the nurse I didn't want anymore visitors because I was tired and feeling unwell. She must have told my mum because I got a text from her saying that she'll be back the next day to take me home.

I felt bad but I was annoyed. She didn't come the night before as she said she would, and didn't call or text to say she wouldn't be able to make it. Next day she tells me she's taking care of a grown man who feels under the weather while I'm recovering from major surgery in hospital and only decides to show up right before visiting hours end. That probably sounds childish but the more I think about it the more annoyed I get.

I have a younger brother too and we're part of a single parent working class family

&#x200B;

I want to preface that I loved my sister and would do all I could to support her. However a couple of incidents has made both me & my mom heart broken and leading me to consider doing as per title.

&#x200B;

Some background on sister: She's the type that would excel in studies seemingly effortlessly and would spend most her free time indulging in her hobbies. Fortunately she obtained a full scholarship to study overseas and left the household at age 15.

The scholarship provided the essentials like room and board and an allowance. Despite that my mom and I would make trips once or twice a year to visit her, take her out for meals, give some extra allowance, buying her stuff (phone, laptop, keyboard piano, etc.). We didn't have much but my mom worked her arse off and saved and made sure we got the essentials.

Switching gears to myself, I wasn't as fortunate or talented as the sister and only managed to complete my UG funded by a combination of student loans, bursaries and funding from mom. This arrangement was made with the plan that when the time came for my younger bro and sis to further their studies, I had to assist because my mom only had enough to put one of us through Uni. Lo and behold my bro managed into a highly coveted public U where fees are negligible and my sister is as above

&#x200B;

Returning to present, my bro and I migrated to the same country where my sister is doing her studies now (cuz greener pastures). Recently we rented a whole apartment with all 3 of us staying together for economies of scale (We 3 had previously rented rooms in different parts of the city). I'm also paying for my sister's part of rent until she graduates. This is the first time we stayed together in \~7 yrs after sis left home.

This is where things turned. In summary she changed for the worst (she's ill-tempered, disrespectful & arrogant). I clashed, hard, with her on trivial things in several occasions but still manage to brush it off and take the high-road but this one thing she said to me broke the camel's back.

&#x200B;

**Paraphrasing a bit, she said I didn't work hard enough, ""took"" my mom's savings for my studies, and she heavily implied that the assistance we've given her (phone, laptop, extra allowance, Hell I'm even paying her room and board right now) it ""Belongs"" to her and I had to ""Pay"" sister back the money used for my studies**

&#x200B;

I was stunned beyond belief and barely remembered the rest. I do rmb feeling so betrayed and anguished...

I'm currently in a cold-war with her because idk how to handle this situation moving forward. I'm hoping to calibrate my moral compass here before I come up with a plan.

That's just life, but it's not really pleasant to be reading on your deck with that going on.


Anyhow, since I'm a ""treat others the way you want to be treated,"" if I have the windows open (and we love to have them open as much as possible) I try to keep the volume on the TV down a bit. My husband has found this INCREDIBLY frustrating for some reason. He said our neighbors don't give a crap about us so we shouldn't cater to them. 


We don't have bad neighbors, but one is a mom with 3 kids so there's obviously more noise coming from them. But that also means I don't want to be watching an episode of Archer at full volume with her grade school age kids potentially hearing everything.


So anyhow, it annoys the crap out of my husband that I take a peak outside to see if our neighbors have their windows open, and if they do, I put the volume down a couple of notches. Last night he hardly wanted to talk with me other than to say I annoyed him and he doesn't give a crap what the neighbors hear or don't hear.

Second edit because someone brought something up i didn't clarify: She wasn't even really getting her food, just... Standing in the line for ages. No one could get food there and several other people had to reach over her too, but i was the first guy to do it so she flipped on me.


I didn't really know a good title for this, but i feel like a bit of an asshole, and people are talking about *jumping me* because of this, so I'm quite nervous.


This happened yesterday but i never got to type it out. So we have potlucks for my yearbook development class every once in a while (yay), and i always bring soda. The people who bring stuff go first, so i got into line behind this girl who was... The slowest moving person i had ever seen. I stood behind her for almost 7 minutes and she never stepped forward, so i had to reach over her to grab food. I said ""sorry"" when i did it, i just wanted to get food. She looked at me and said in a purposefully bitchy accent ""EXCUSE ME? Are you cutting the damn line?"" Of course i responded with ""No, you've been holding up the line, i just wanna get food."" Now wanna know her 'perfectly reasonable' (in everyone elses words and hers) reaction was to 'kindly' tell me to ""Not be such a little fucking toxic bitch"". Who even says toxic irl?


Of course, if you saw my last asking post, you know i don't just stand there and let people insult me, but i don't just go and hit people. I just told her she was being the bitch here and then she started threatening to beat me and saying ""and if you hit me back you'd go to prison"". I just kept telling her to hit me... Not a good play on my part, i know. She tried to slap me and failed, so then i said ""You on your fucking period or something? I literally tried to get food as kindly as possible, even saying sorry, and you flip out on me over fucking nothing!"".


Suffice to say she said I'm a bigoted misogynist (is that the right spelling? Its the woman hater thing) because of that, and starts going around to grab her friends, planning to jump me tomorrow. (Like, tommorow as in today, since this was yesterday). Of course no one believed me when i said that, so... Yay.


I feel like an asshole for replying to her insults in kind because she's a woman, but at the same time... I really just repeated what she said, AND she tried to hit me. Do you guys think I'm the asshole too?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

So, before I start I just want to say I (19m) am a long time smoker. I come from a troubled past, came to Canada from Korea w/ my family, and we were dirt poor living in a very bad area of town. I did a lot of bad things growing up, smoking included, however, one day I just woke up and grew up, and got in to university on a full ride scholarship to my first choice in university. Right now I work as a sales associate at a car dealership for the summer.

So I have been trying to quit smoking for 2 years now, I've relapsed twice, and I've found chewing nicotine gum or vaping to be a better alternative, my goal is to completely stop w/ any nicotine products by the end of this summer, I rarely ever use the vape, and I have slowly been putting less and less volumes of nicotine in the juice, however I will occasionally take a ""vape"" break just like the smokers at our work do, they have 20 mins but I try and only stay out for 5 mins before heading back to work.

Some people are telling me vaping is not the same as smoking and they are progressively going from passive aggression, to slowly just being full on aggressive towards me. One lady in particular who you would define as your typical Karen gets extremely angry, she complains that I'm just trying to waste time to my boss, and she always gives me the dirtiest looks to me when I go out to take a vape break amongst the other smokers. I got called in to the HR reps office, and she told me I was no longer permitted to ""waste time vaping"". 

I told her that I have just as much of a right to be out there w/ the smokers wasting time smoking, and the way I see it, I'm not even going out there everyday, I'm trying to quit, and I'm rarely out there. I told her my POV and said that its not a problem and I will stop.

the ""Karen"" was literally waiting right outside and asked what happened, I told her that I was no longer gonna be taking smoke breaks and she said 

""Good because its kind of an asshole move for you to try and take a break when we have a legitimate reason- we can't help ourselves, stop trying to look cool and take time off work, ok?""

AITA? I don't think I am, I just want to see if vaping and smoking is actually all that different, I really think that everyone is just overreacting."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx3yo4	2019-06-05 15:37:18	rebelwithoutaloo	AITA for not wanting to meet my SOs ex?	" I have been dating my SO long distance for 2 years. He has been divorced for about 5 now. We take turns visiting each other about every two months. Last time I visited him in October 2018 we went to pick up his oldest (16) to get her ears pierced.  I was asked to wait in the car because SO told me his ex wasn’t ready to meet me yet. No problem.  
  I’ve never been very interested in meeting any exes anyway. If kids have been in the picture I’ve never felt it was about “who are my kids being taken around” and has just been more fodder for judgment.  Anyway, no biggie. I’ve met exes before. 
   I visited him again this month and SO mentioned that she was ready to meet me, would I like to meet her? I said no. He seemed taken aback and said that it would be polite. I told him if he really wanted me to and she doesn’t feel pushed into meeting me/is concerned about who may be around her kids then I would. He said “oh if she didn’t want to she would tell me!” 
  The thing is, I really don’t feel comfortable. It never seems to be about making sure the kids are around ok people. I also get the feeling she is not completely over their relationship.

Context: Myself and prior friend live in an area where phone signal is awful, and calls disconnect often.

I was speaking to a friend who I hadn't spoken to in a while about going to an event with me later in the month. While talking about where and when we should meet, the phone service has disconnected the call and in said short space of time between us being disconnected and me being able to reply saying sorry for the call disconnecting due to poor signal, she has sent me seven messages making claims that I am ignoring her on call and that I don’t care about her in the space of 2-3 minutes.

When I was finally able to speak to her and explain instead of her saying “sorry I assumed…” She has stated that She is ""entitled to her own response” and “She is just being real instead of fake”. My only response following was could you ask what happened to the call before accusing me of ignoring her (I was actually mid-sentence when the call stopped working).

She finally went onto say that she was the victim, that I am blaming her for the phones poor signal and to either drop the conversation or stop speaking to her, which she then decided on her own by saying bye before I am able to even comprehend a response.

The situation has made me feel really uncomfortable overall. As though it’s my fault and that I’m overreacting even though I know she would have the same response as I would if the roles were reversed."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So first off I know that the former friend of mine is an asshole in this situation, I just want to know if I am too since a couple people have said that I am.

I'm going to keep this as short as possible. A friend of mine told our group about the fact that a couple nights ago, he got really drunk and slept with his girlfriend's sister. He says they look very alike (which they don't really, there's definetly a family resemblance  but they're noticeably different to look at) and that he thought he was sleeping with his girlfriend because he was so drunk. There are several reason this doesnt add up but I wont get into that.

The part that really got me was that he was laughing his ass of as he told this story, he thought it was hilarious.

I immediately cut ties with him as I have personal experience as the victim of infidelity and it really pisses me off. A couple of our friends said I was overreacting because it was ""just a mistake"". I stuck to my guns. Today I've found out that he has now told his girlfriend about what happened and apparently they're all good and she doesn't care. I still refuse to speak to him. It is because of this that I'm being called an asshole now because I won't talk to him even though his girlfriend who is the victim in this situation has forgiven him and doesn't seem bothered by what happened.

So tell me reddit, AITA? Am I overreacting?

My SO and I have been together for nearly a year. We've had a mostly perfect relationship until about a couple months ago when they did something that completely shattered my trust. I had every opportunity and reason to call it quits right then and there, but I didn't. I convinced myself that trust could be rebuilt and I gave my SO tools in which to do so. I discussed, clearly and with great detail, my needs in moving forward. All was well for about a week. Then, slowly over time, my needs were no longer being met. The transparency wasnt there. I was finding my partner in tiny white lies. Each time, I would reiterate my needs, we would agree on the terms, and move on. 

Now, months into this, I still lack any trust. I'm horribly suspicious over the most trivial things. I'm beyond insecure. I'm still having to remind my partner over and over again what I need when they dont meet my expectations. I hate myself for the conditions I have set and I know that my behavior and doubts will be the end of this relationship. I'm out of control and I dont know how to fix it.

My ex and I dated for 3 years until I found out she cheated on me. We broke up. During the relationship both my parents died. YES, BOTH. fkn sucks but that's cancer. I'm 25 at the time. Anyways, what people don't tell you is that you don't only inheret your parent's assets, you also inheret their debts. So I was stuck paying their loans and etc. 

&#x200B;

I had a tooth ache and in my country it is expensive to visit the dentist and she threw me some money to help with it. 

After we broke up, I found out she had cheated with 15-17 guys during my relationship. I'm dead serious. I know their names even. She would do it while I was working a second job to help pay for our needs and my parent's debts. I also got an STD from her which is stuck with me for life. I can't bring myself to give her the money on top of the stuff she did to me. AITA?

Financially, we can afford one. However, I am reluctant to do so for many reasons. Having grown up in a not “well to do” family, I am not comfortable with having a maid as I don’t like the idea of instructing another human being to do housework for me on a daily basis, We have part time cleaners and even then I feel “bad” about it. I am also not comfortable with having a stranger living in my house as I value my privacy. I have also heard horror stories from friends about maids who didn’t work out and I think it would be more trouble than it’s worth.   Honestly I just don’t like the idea of having a live in maid and I really don’t want one.

I have explained these reasons to my wife but her response is that those are not valid reasons especially if we can afford help. Her reason is that she is too tired and a maid would make her life easier. 

My wife has a full time job and I am running my own business. We have one 5 year old daughter. We currently split the household chores. I sort out laundry, pack the kid’s lunches, ferry her to / from kindergarten every day, and take care of our dog . My mother helps babysit my daughter after kindergarten.  We hire help to come in twice a week to clean the house etc.  We rarely cook at home because of our schedules, and usually end up eating out or ordering in.

I don’t understand why my wife thinks we need a maid. I have asked her what she needs help with so we can look at whether I can do more or whether there are other solutions instead of hiring a maid. 

She got upset because she thinks I am accusing her of just being lazy and that I am insensitive for not understanding the real work that a wife and mother has to do around the house.

&#x200B;

We have been together 6 months. 3 months into the relationship they left for two 2-week trips, where we communicated very very little. I was happy for them and I didn't mind staying alone for that period. On the time between the two trips I asked if we could spend 2-3 days together. 2-3 days where we could have date nights, going to cinema, walks etc. They said yes and then canceled most of the plans, because they had other plans they forgot. We discussed it and they admitted it was rude and they need to plan better.

&#x200B;

Only it did not get much better. It is not so much the cancelling but that I have to push for our plans a lot and we usually end up sleeping of watching netflix while they meet their friends all the time for festivals and parties all the time. Where we live, the sunny days are few and random. I asked to do something together at least the days were it was warm and nice. Today it was the only day it was warm and nice and they decided to go swimming with a random friend instead of me because they had some plans anyway before. 

&#x200B;

I saw red at that moment. We have spent very little time together (didn't see each other for a month or more). They have ignored my suggestions for dates for a long time and I demanded on the spot that unless it is for work, then next time they will change their plans to meet me instead. I told them that I have other needs other than sleeping. It is 3 months now that I am asking for dates and I am reaching an ending point.

I thought it was a great concept and asked her if she would be willing to write a book about it since neither of us can draw. She agreed immediately and we began. She pumped me all up with the notion that we both were going to be 50/50 on this. The work was supposed to be split evenly. Since her original idea was only partial, we both had to come up with the rest of the story, characters, turning points, etc... Though she was giving me some pointers and helping out with the dialogue, I was the only one actually writing the story. I wrote the first one hundred pages but she never ever wrote anything. She knew everything on those one hundred pages because I kept her on the loop. When I told her to edit them, she kept beating around the bush on why she hadnt done it. I had to drive up to her house and only then, she finally sat down with me for a few hours to review it and edit it. Note that I was the one who ended up re-writing it after the editon was made.  She continued telling me she loved it and she couldnt wait for it to be finished. 

Well, I continued working on it because I had already invested so much time on it. We had the story structurized and complete so I kept pushing but eventually gave up since she  wouldn't help. I had also hit a wall, I had a severe case of writers block so I left it. Even though the book hit a paused, we continued talking about it and all the things we wanted to add/change on it but neither of us was actually working on that. Last week, a huge wave of inspiration hit me like a train on a track and the urge of writing came back. I told her I was starting again and I did. She just agreed and left it at that. A week has passed and I have written a lot more, but without her input the idea is gravitating towards my version of it. I have asked for her input but she doesn't help me at all. The more I write, the more I fall in love with the story. I've introduced new characters and new turning points that make the story a lot different than the original idea, however, the plot remains the same. 

Today, I decided that I was done asking her for any input or any help. It will take another six months to finish it but when that happens, I intend on sending it out to different publishing houses. Am I the asshole for finishing the book on my own and not putting her as an author on it? 

I cant help but feel bad about it, but it irritates me so much that she won't put any effort on it. We both have a full time job and we both have busy lives, but we all know that you make time for the things that matter to you, and she doesnt seem to really care for it."	Not the A-hole	1	0

"My girlfriend and I have around the same income, but she has much more debt than me, so she tends to have less money overall. She recently got a vet bill that was more than she was expecting and didn't have enough money to pay for it, which is when I learned she didn't have a savings account. (I just got a small spot bonus at work and had a little bit of extra money at the time, so thankfully I was able to help her pay for it.)

We recently went on a small trip together—I paid for the tickets/hotel upfront and she was going to pay me back (for her half) a little bit per each paycheck leading up to the trip, which she did. I told her that I'd let her keep $70 if she opened up a savings account and stuck the money in there instead of putting it towards what she owed me and she agreed. I was mostly just worried about her not having one at all, since we're both almost 30 and unexpected expenses (like the vet bill) happen.

She opened the account, but two months later, she hasn't put the $70 in it. When I made that offer, I meant ""put it in when you make the account,"" since she took the $70 out of the payment she sent me that paycheck. Apparently she didn't interpret it that way—she just thought I mean ""eventually,"" and the one time I brought it up, she seemed pretty upset.

I know it's ""just"" $70, but I'm disappointed and a bit hurt that she didn't uphold her end of the deal. I told her when I made the offer that if she didn't want to open an account, that was totally fine, but she said she was good with the offer. I sort of wish I hadn't offered at all; I'm not her mom and it wasn't my place to tell her what to do with her finances, and even if it came from a place of concern, it was probably overstepping.

Would I be an asshole if I just asked for the $70 back, since she didn't put it in her savings like she agreed to do and I had to put an extra $70 towards our trip? It *feels* like I'd be the asshole, since I know she struggles with money and I have more stability overall. Part of me thinks I just need to let it go and not bring it up again, since it's my own fault for making the offer in the first place.

"The backstory here: for school I have to make a video which is supposed to be in the style of a soap. We've already worked on it for 4-5 weeks and it's still 3-4 weeks until the deadline. We were supposed to film it today during the (one-hour long) lesson, but yesterday we heard that the location where we were supposed to film isn't available anymore, and there isn't another chance to film there. Also, our whole lesson got cancelled because the teacher wasn't available, but she said that if we keep the classroom clean we could still work there.

A bit more backstory: I was supposed to leave directly after filming, because I was supposed to get a vaccination, and even then I would still be too late for that because if I wanted to be on time I had to leave in the middle of the lesson.

I thought: alright, since this lesson is cancelled and we still have three weeks until the deadline we can just go home, I still have do to some work but I could easily do that at home (and I will do it)

That wasn't the thought of one of the other members of the group. He stressed way too much over it. He wanted to stay and work during the lesson because 'we still had much to do', even though I think one lesson won't make a difference.

2 members think we should stay, 2 (including me) think we should just go home, however he has agreed to stay. I agreed to stay to, because I can't take the other them, even though I really want to leave.

I need to go soon because I still need to get the vaccination and I still have to eat because I didn't bring lunch because I thought I would still be home in time since the lesson got cancelled, so I will probably only stay for 10 minutes.

2. Ask them what certificates I need other than the one I'm currently working on and which professional associations I should join.

3. Ask them to help me write a professional development plan based on the information they provided me during the second part of the assignment. Although, I intend on just writing the plan and asking them to critique it, rather than asking them to help me write it. Since this person is only meant to be my mentor temporarily for this assignment, I do not wish to take up too much of their valuable time.

4. Enroll in any certification training courses and join any professional associations they recommended.

5. Turn in the professional development plan and provide contact information for my mentor.

6. Ask my mentor to write a letter of recommendation.

This sounds much easier than it is. It seems that everyone in the field has too much attitude to mentor anyone. I made appointments with several potential mentors, when I made the appointments I stated what it was regarding and was met with attitudes from their secretaries. When I arrived at my appointments I told them what certification I was working on, which course I was taking and which assignment I was working on. I politely asked if they had any interest in being my temporary mentor for this assignment. I was met with attitude, impatience and unprofessionalism. I was told to just do the course, the course I was already doing, to come back after I had received my certification. I just left it at that and went on my merry way.

By the fifth time this happened... Rather than just getting up and leaving, I respectfully stated that I was currently taking the course and that this assignment was a part of it. She went off on me, but it seemed like something else was bothering her, something that had nothing to do with me. I remained calm and professional.

I found it ironic that while working on a professional development course, that the only person behaving professionally was me. After doing some research online, I found that bad attitudes and unprofessionalism are typical in this particular field.

There is a lot of job growth in this field, which is one of the reasons why I chose this field. I'm left to wonder if I should keep looking for a mentor or if this is just not the field for me.

AITA for needing a mentor to complete this assignment?

Edit/Update: I appreciate the comments. I think that the state just made this more difficult than it needed to be. I wrote and submitted my “professional development plan” if I can call it that, received my credits and completed the course."	Not enough info	0	0

bx3fu1	2019-06-05 14:51:11	Samkitty96	AITA for getting upset that my dad takes my car when he wants	"So in January, my dad and I went shopping for a new car for me, because my 200,000 mile Chevy Blazer was about to fall apart. He fell in love with a 2018 Jeep Renegade (I needed 4wd). He test drove it, and when we got back, I wanted to look at some used Jeeps. He wouldn't allow it. So I sign the paperwork and kind of pause when we get to the monthly payments. It was going to be 490 per month. Again, I ask if we could look at a cheaper one and was shot down. Now, including insurance, I'm paying 740 dollars per month for this car. His name is on it so I could stay on the insurance, but he does not pay anything for it. He also takes it when he wants, without asking, despite having two trucks and my mom's car. 

Yesterday, shit hit the fan when I was informed via text that I was going to have to take my grandmother's old car to work on Friday. Turns out, they had planned a family trip to an amusement park several states away... without me. And they were taking my car. I finally put my foot down and said no, and that I had plans on Saturday. I was just so sick of having to share this car I pay more than a paycheck for every month. I do still live at home, (grandmother owns the home), because I can't afford rent with this huge payment.

Now I've been informed, via Facebook, that I have until Monday to get my own insurance and until next month to get my dad's name off of the Jeep. That isn't what bothers me. I wanted to do that anyway. What bothers me is that because of this fight, my mom, who I've been close to all my life, is angry at me and acts like I shouldn't want to have my car to myself.

AITA for getting mad that my parents take my car when they want?

Update: A lot has happened since I posted this. I took a mental health day off of work so I could deal with this situation. Called the loan company to get his name off of the loan, so I could get his name off of the car. I also looked at seeing a therapist because I internalized some stuff. My dad actually apologized.  They're still going on the trip, but they're taking a different car. He also kind of walked back his ultimatum. Everything can stay as is, but I think I'll still get my own insurance because it is cheaper. I've thought about deleting this post because I didn't intend to get this huge, but I figured I would give an update."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Met a woman whose in-laws are worth $1 billion but keep her on a financial leash. What I do for a living, she loves as a hobby. Now she has this terrible business idea, which is total BS, she's just bored and wants to feed her own ego because nobody takes her seriously.

We met 3 times, she invited me for lunch, she went on for hours and hours about her shitty idea, wanting me to agree with her. I was being very very EXTRA polite, trying to steer her into the direction that her business is not gonna work for various reasons. I hoped she'd get there herself. She totally ignored it and just went on and on. What really pi$$ed me off was her assuming I'd do favours in the industry for her since 'we're friends'. I have only met her 3 times, she doesn't know anything about me, isn't interested, and all she does is squeeze me for info and reassurance.

Another thing that annoyed me was her assumption that 'we're so alike, we have the same passion'. No. She's a bored housewife who doesn't get to spend her in-laws money as much as she'd like, frustrated and confused, while I studied, worked and built important business relationships in my field for 20 years.

Husband said I was being too nice, and next time I should just tell her straight out 'I don't work for free, there's clearly no potential friendship here, since friends don't squeeze new friends for their work contacts, and no potential business relationship here, since you assume my time and expertise aren't valuable enough for you to pay me'.

I have been beyond fortunate to never have to deal with death. If anybody has time to keep me company that would be lovely I will be sat in the waiting room for at least a week and my sister leaves tonight. Thank you for your humanity. I don't know how to send direct messages but I have had a few and will reply to anybody even just to share.

I really don't know what I should do Reddit please help me.

My grandparents were in a car accident on Saturday and my sister, mother and grandfather were all in the car. The complete right hand side of the car was crushed (UK so drivers side) which sat my grandfather and mother behind. My grandfather died instantly and my mother was rushed to a specialist hospital as she suffered serious brain damage. My grandmother is in a different hospital, my sister is absolutely fine except for a broken wrist.

My grandmother has terminal cancer and hemophilia, has had several blood transfusions but I have been told she isn't going to make it past Friday. My mother is in a medically induced coma but is brain-dead and doctors have told me she won't survive off whatever machine is keeping her alive.

My grandmother is currently awake although internally she is not in a good way. I told her that my mother broke both her legs and has damage but otherwise ok... I even showed her an old photo to pretend she is fine and my grandmother believed it. I can't tell her. My sister wants to tell her but what is the fucking point? Am I the asshole if I let her die thinking her daughter is still alive or does she deserve the truth?? 

Sat at my mother's bedside right now and in 4 hours I'm going to the other hospital to see my sister and ultimately decide what to do - what do people think? Please help me I am only 24 I have no idea and will do what everybody thinks is the best course of action.

I’ve warned him about hickies and showed him where he could give them (basically anywhere not visible if I wore a crop top). Though he’s given me hickies on my neck and arm(yea idk) several times even after I’ve warned him about it. This time it’s bad, dark hickies all over my neck and arm. At the time he his doing them I hardly notice because he doesn’t hurt me when doing it. While he does feel bad and has apologized for them, this is like the 5th time he’s done it. I mean there has to be some sort of consequence to his action right? I guess I could just tell him not to kiss me there but I end up losing track. 

TL:DR: WIBTA if I make my SO buy me concealer after all the times he’s given me hickies? I haven’t brought this idea up to him yet because I want to know if I’m going overboard.

bx3a99	2019-06-05 14:36:58	ilovetherollingrocks	AITA for not being present enough for my roommates birthday party?	"Hey y’all, long time lurker/first time poster.  For some context: I’m 20F college student , and live in an on campus apartment with four other housemates (3 girls, 1 boy). 

So one of the housemates, S, threw a birthday party for herself this past Saturday. Unfortunately before that, I hurt my knee pretty badly(it wasn’t a skinned knee or anything, I had to go to urgent care and was put on crutches after receiving injections around the kneecap/flushing it out) . No one asked me or my other two housemates (S is dating B, the only male housemate, so that just leaves the rest of us girls) if a party could be thrown, I just happened to log onto Facebook that night and receive an invitation. 

Now, my bf drives here to spend time with me on weekends, so he was here. That day while at work, I received a text from my BF letting me know that he drove S to get party food.

He ended up spending around $50-$60 on food for her. He also ordered a bunch of combo pizzas for her (since she’s vegetarian) but when she asked to check them while taking them home, they had meat on them so they had to buy new ones. 

Back at the apartment, my leg was throbbing so we laid down. After the party started, I told him that we should put our time in (hang out for a while) just so we don’t make S feel bad.  We were there for about an hour.Once my knee began to throb, we excused ourselves. 

So my ex roommate stops by. I come out and we talk for a little while, but after about 20 mins my leg begins to throb and I hug her goodbye. I eventually go back to studying and I knock out. 

The next morning, my BF left and I went out to make some food. I always say good morning to everyone, and when I said it to S she ignored me. Okay, she’s definitely mad about something. I tried to talk to her, but she ignored me/slammed doors/stomped around/etc. 

B said she was mad about:
1.) Not everyone talking to each other (different people from different clubs/classes not intermingling)

2.) people showing up late/leaving early

3.) people being really loud

4.) mad at my ex housemate for greeting her with, “Where’s ilovetherollingrocks?” Instead of, “Haply Birthday S!” 

5.) mad at me for only talking to my ex housemate when I came out for the second time

6.) mad at me, my BF, and A for not participating in party games/activities/hanging out for longer

B let me know that he and S think I should apologize. I reminded him I wasn’t there for most of it due to my leg. He said in S’s POV, I just left for no reason. 

I felt that if I confronted her about her behavior after the party, I would subject everyone in the apartment to a temper tantrum. Being that it’s extremely close to finals, I told B I would let her cool off. 

So that conversation was this past Sunday. Throughout the week, I’ve been civil and short. 

I woke up to two long texts from both S and B. 
S kind of apologized for it being weird and asked if I wanted to talk. B pleaded for me to talk to her.

"Some background, a few days ago I brought home some dinner excited to talk about the eventful day I had at work. The details about what happened don’t matter per say, but I was excited to vent after a long day. Anyways, after finishing my story and sharing my thoughts on the day I could tell she wasn’t listening, or interested, so I said “I feel like my stories are boring to you” in which she replied “well I mean... kinda”

Hurt, I don’t say anything in reply and I let her eat while I watch YouTube and eat my dinner. It doesn’t come up again for a few days as I try to forget about it. However, last night we are in bed about 9pm and she starts to go off about her day. Mind you, her story is just like mine except it’s work drama. There are about 7 names I have to connect together, remember what their place are in the story, and why what they did was upsetting. After trying to follow for 5 or so minutes (even trying to clarify certain things) I give up and let her just vent away. She could tell I was no longer interested, and asked why I wasn’t listening to which I reply “well, you didn’t listen to my story just a few nights ago because it was boring”. She said it was in a joking manner, but clearly it wasn’t. She stopped talking about her day and said I didn’t need to be an asshole about it.

So am I the asshole for not wanting to listen?

Edit: The overwhelming majority if not 100% is that ESH. Which, I am not going to argue with to be honest. I know what I did was petty, so I decided to FaceTime her and address the fact that I felt bad for doing what I did. Thanks for the outside input, it can be tough to decide who’s wrong in what situation.

As for the communication aspect, for the most part we always listen to each others stories or day by making efforts to ask at some point during the night. These two events though, were more the thing I was interested in having an opinion about."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bx30ur	2019-06-05 14:13:02	aronkra	AITA for not caring or wanting to go to my “friend’s funeral?	"I usually hang around my best friend who introduced me to a lot of people. When I was 14 he introduced me to his new group of friends which tug around, make jokes about each other, y’know tease. They sometimes made me really upset. But there was this one guy, let’s call him Brad. Brad, unlike most of us which were about 1 year apart in age, was 4 years apart, he was an adult. Brad would try to exclude me from hanging out, making sure I felt lonely and bad. And unlike the other people who were just teasing, he would full on roast me for no reason until I actually started crying. I felt worthless as a person thanks to this guy. He would do this every day I saw him. He acted like Rick from Rick and Morty. Everyone else in the group kinda looked away during that because he had some older kid respect bullshit. This went on for 3 more years until the group started to split apart, two friends including my best friend moved away. Once in a while we would all meet up for DnD through discord. I hadn’t talked to Brad in a year since that point, and he was a lot more sincere as a person, I learned more about him. Brad was more doing streaming and trying to get on YouTube, with little to no success. His other career pursuits went pretty badly too. He was diagnosed with depression and Schizophrenia. He would use it as a joke or to make his actions seem tolerable, explained. I got to know his other friends really well. I hung out with him a little bit. I just couldn’t forgive him, he wasn’t kind to me even after this change, he was kind of, neutral. I tried to get nicer with him, I had a Snapchat streak, I tried to connect with him. However it hurt me to do this because I remember how he treated me, I remember feeling less than human, I remember feeling left out. I’m sure every high schooler had a similar experience with someone.

So I find out this week that this man took his own life. I kind of knew it, he told me on Snapchat about it. But honestly I heard him joke about depression so much, him saying he was going to do it meant dirt to me. I also thought this was a scheme to get attention, either way I didn’t care. I later found out he went to the hospital for depression and he couldn’t afford his medicine, but I don’t blame myself for not knowing, or for being able to prevent it.

So now I am choosing not to see this man’s funeral or even care about all the “great” memories my friends had with him. The man hurt me emotionally, I don’t want to honor him. I’m not telling my friends why I’m not going because they have a vision of him that I don’t. I know one of those friends doesn’t have a car to see his funeral, and I’m not willing to drive him. I want to move on, and I feel like I’d cry at the funeral because they would talk about my bully like he lived as a saint. I don’t care enough to see his corpse. And my friends are puzzled why and it’s not their business to know. I don’t think he’s worth my time to see."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx2wsx	2019-06-05 14:02:23	BeneficiSystemat	WIBTA for getting my sister-in-law fired	"(Throwaway because family knows my account.)

&#x200B;

Short introduction: My sister-in-law is guillable af and an MLM that she hasn't fallen for has not yet been invented. She is selling it all, from the wraps to the oils, to some sort of weight-loss coffee thing she swears by. She pretty much lives on FB and to be fair, so do I (a lot of family lives abroad and its a good way to stay in contact). That's how I even realized something was up in the first place.

The problem: SIL has a degree from a good college in a field that guarantees quite the decent pay, so she recently got a fulltime job (because my brother made her after she started spending my familys money on her scams) and while I don't want to get too into it, it involves people with drug addictions and very heavy personal trauma. Lately I've been noticing that she started following a lot of people on FB and when I dug a little (I don't trust her, okay?) I realized she knew most of those people through her work. She also started leaving inappropriate comments on people's walls, praising the effects of her oils and stuff for things that range from migrains to anxiety disorders and depression. I also realized that she had started recruiting some of those people for her MLMs.

Last week, I decided to talk to her about it, casually asking about how she knew those people etc. and when she confirmed how she knew them, I told her to her face that what she was doing was really shitty and super unethical in my book. Tbh, I was really fcking mad and I still am, especially because all she did was talk about how she was the one with the degree so she knew better. I tried talking to my brother about it but we aren't really all that close and whenever I tell him something, she just refutes it and he believes her.

I could go to her boss and report her for misconduct or something like that, since I know they have very strict ethical guidelines of how to treat their patients but obviously that would hurt my brother and I don't want her to start relying on my families money for her pyramid schemes again.

So WIBTA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: SHE GOT FIRED!! It wasn't my doing, to be clear: she added some of her co-workers on FB who saw what she was doing and she got reprimanded a few days after I posted this. She has now been FIRED after she continued trying to scheme people. My brother did not appreciate my ""I told you so"" because he thinks people at her job just didn't like her (??) and apparently she's been blacklisted from working in the industry in my city.

bx2v8e	2019-06-05 13:58:28	Double_Meet	AITA for not feeling sorry for my wife's root canal?	"This is pretty simple. At some point after our marriage, my wife went from brushing her teeth twice a day + flossing, to no longer flossing, to brushing only once a day, and finally, brushing once every other day. Her justification has always been ""I forgot"" in the morning or ""I'm too tired"" at night (even though she can lay in bed on her phone for 10+ minutes before calling it quits). For the past 6 months, before we go to bed, I will say ""Did you brush your teeth?"" and she will say ""No"" in a bashful way. I will tell her, ""Go brush your teeth"" and she will respond with ""I'm too tired"". I will then end up making a typical frustrated 'ugh' sound. And it's true she is usually tired. She works 12+ hour shifts and sometimes brings her work home. One day off a week, so she's working 65+ hours a week. But I'm not asking her to workout or do some life altering task. It's just brushing your teeth!

&#x200B;

Every now and then, I will let her know she's gonna end up in a bad spot with her teeth and any procedure she get is not only gonna be painful, but expensive too despite having dental insurance. This went on for 6 months and a month ago, she started having some bad pain in her mouth. She went to the dentist and turns out she needs a root canal. I know root canals are no joke. I had one when I was 11, and after all the pain and vomiting during those multiple procedures, I swore to take care of my teeth. Since then, zero cavities (we're 27 now).  So when she told me she will have to get one, I think she expected me to feel sympathetic, empathetic, and sorry for the trouble she will be going through. What ended up coming out of my mouth was ""And whose fault is that?"" along with a ""You have no one to blame but yourself"". This set off a small argument and she hasn't spoken to me for a full 24 hours.

&#x200B;

I'm just having a hard time feeling sorry for her. In fact, I feel pissed about it. This could literally have all been avoided. And if for some reason she needed a root canal despite her brushing everyday? I definitely would've felt bad for her. But she brought this on herself.  I reminded her often to brush her teeth, I warned her, I talked to her about it over 6 months and she didn't listen. Now that it's all a reality, she wants me to feel sorry for her. I'm not her parent and she's not a little kid. She's an adult and she should know better to keep playing with ""fire"" like that.

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: So yeah, YTA seems to be the consensus. I'm planning to make it up to her by taking her out (to a tooth friendly) restaurant and movie. Also gonna apologize and admit my frustration got to me.

I've been smoking about 2 years and I initially tried to quit with him, but I work in sales and the lack of focus due to withdrawal was causing me to have difficulty meeting my sales goals, so I started smoking again after about 3 days.  This bothers my DH deeply, and he constantly tried to convince me to quit, which I understand. But this morning we were driving to work and I asked him to stop and pick up a pack of cigarettes because I'm out, he was mad that we had to stop, but we did anyways. I left my ID in the car so I asked him to get me the kind I smoke, he instead got me the worst tasting, lowest nicotine cigarettes they sold. That pissed me off and I told him that since it was my money in the account I should be able to buy whatever I wanted with it. This started a massive fight on the road where I was screaming at him and he was turning the radio up way too loud, I was turning it off and he was turning it back on, generally terrible and irresponsible on both of our  parts. We drove past where I work and he told me that since I was acting like this that I can just walk to work from sonic (it was about a half mile from where I work, but it was also pouring down rain and cold.) I told him to turn the car around and held my door open until he did so. I made him park at my parking lot at work so we could calm down and talk, I lit up a cigarette to chill out and this made him mad. He grabbed my cigarette and hit it 3 times while I was trying to grab it back from him. This made me start crying and he said something along the lines of, that is what I feel everytime I see you smoking, It's like if you watched me drink a bottle of poison every day. I told him that I have said multiple times if he dosent want me to smoke around him I wont. He says it's not that I'm doing it around him, it's that I'm doing it period. He dosent want to loose me early because of smoking, which I understand, but I still dont feel like I should be forced to quit when I'm not ready. He said that he is going to start smoking again until I quit. I dont want that to happen but if he does it's his choice. 
Am I the asshole for not quitting the moment he did and causing all this trouble? We get into fights about it so much and its tearing me apart. I know I need to quit but it's just so hard with work and thw stress in my life."		1	0
bx2syl	2019-06-05 13:52:20		AITA for being pissed at my roommate?	"We needed to replace the filter in our AC unit, so I bought new ones and replaced it.  Turns out the new ones I bought were too high of rating for our AC and now I think there's something wrong with our AC (no air flow from vents).  

I work a 9-5 job and my roommate does wedding videography, so he's home literally all day everyday (except when shooting weddings on some weekends).  

I asked if he could call our landlord about getting the AC repaired today and he said I should call.  I said wow must be way too busy at home today to make a call.  He said ""I didn't break it"".  Like holy shit dude just a tiny bit of help while I'm at work would be appreciated."		1	0
bx2swn	2019-06-05 13:52:13		AITA for not giving my roommate more of the profits?	"So, the background is that my roommate just bought a condo and is renovating it. It came furnished with a lot of old furniture, decorations, and appliances, which he does not want. I've been helping him do small tasks with the apartment every now and then, like hauling trash and helping design. I even helped him help a neighbor move in, and in return the neighbor gave my roommate some brand new appliances (stove, refrigerator, and a toilet) for a drastically reduced price. So far I've asked for nothing and received no compensation for my help.

&#x200B;

One of the things I've been recommending to my roommate during his renovation has been to remove any old furniture/appliances/decorations he does not want to keep so we can better visualize what color to paint and how to arrange the layout. Unsure of how to get rid of things, I told him to either rent a dumpster or sell it on craigslist. He offered me a deal where if I sell the items on craigslist, I can have all money generated. The catch is that he have no involvement. Since I've been unemployed for almost two months, this seemed like a great opportunity for me.

&#x200B;

I listed the couch on craigslist, and after nearly two weeks of negotiating with a crazy lady I made the arrangements. I did all of the scheduling and made it work for everybody. The only thing my roommate had to do was get up 30 minutes earlier for work and drive to his condo with me to open the door for the the mover and myself. I'll give him credit that he did help bring down the ottoman, but that was pretty much his whole involvement. I received a $100 bill, and the mover left with the couch.

&#x200B;

I gave him the $5 I had aside from the $100 bill because he did help out. Dead serious, he looked at me and said ""my cut is 20%"". When I told him the terms were I keep all the money, he countered with the fact he would not be involved at all. I told him if he gives me back the $5, I'll buy him dinner. I dropped the matter, and agreed to talk about it later.

&#x200B;

I then went up with him to his apartment to help give more design advice. While there, he asks if anybody has given an offer on his other couch he wants removed. I hadn't yet listed it, so I took pictures and am currently working on that. On the way out, he said he wants to keep the $5 and then asked me when I'm buying him dinner. Again, we argued about the terms. The interaction ended with him asking me if I want to go to Home Depot to help him pick up items, even though he should be leaving for work immediately if he wanted to get there on time. When asked about his timing, he said ""you don't worry about me"".

&#x200B;

I have a lot of feelings about it, but I tried to keep that pretty uneditorialized. Overall, I feel it's impossible to have him not involved whatsoever because he has the only key to that apartment.  Regardless of my feelings, I would like to know if I'm the asshole and if I should give him more of the profits."	Everyone Sucks	1	0

bx2qmj	2019-06-05 13:46:10	schmuckmulligan	AITA for spurring my neighbor's dog into a blind, frothy rage?	"I had a nasty encounter with a neighbor yesterday afternoon, and although I've been fuming ever since, I can't tell if I'm riding a wave of righteous indignation or trying to power through shame at having been a total asshole.

**Background:** I have a scary-looking dog. She's a sweetheart, but if you Google ""hellhound,"" you'll see several reasonable approximations of her appearance. I try to be sensitive to others' fears, as misplaced as they may be, so part of my dog's training is constantly refining her responses to stressful stimuli.
 
**Situation:** I was out on a fine day, having a nice walk with the pup. I walked past one neighbor's house a few blocks over, and her midsize terrier bolted across the yard and threw itself against the fence, totally freaking out, snarling, barking madly. I continued a few steps further with my dog, who was becoming jumpy but was still below losing-her-shit threshold. I stopped 15 feet beyond their property line standing on the street, and placed my dog in a ""sit"" and started reaching for treats. Normal training stuff. This is a useful training scenario, because it allows me to reward her for keeping her cool in the face of something that's hard for dogs to handle. 

My neighbor came barreling out of her house -- we'd been there perhaps 15 seconds, and I was engaged with my dog. Neighbor yelled, ""I was just wondering why YOU were stopped HERE."" I was flustered by the fury and instantly pissed. I said, ""I'm training in case she has to deal with poorly trained dogs."" My neighbor said, ""Oooh, training, great idea for THAT thing."" She gestured dismissively. Rapidly approaching my own losing-my-shit threshold, I said something along the lines of, ""I'm on a public street, but I wish you the best of luck if you're ever interested in getting your dog's act together."" It's worth noting that I was being far from pleasant here, and we were well into the depths of white-people sarcastic derision via false compliment. This level of hostility is generally one step below gunfire. She stormed off, presumably to bring her dog back inside, maybe to get a handgun, and my doggo and I moved along.

**Assessment:** On one hand, I feel fully justified. I'm not responsible for her dog's behavior, and I never set foot on her property. I owe her nothing. I'd also like to think that if she approached me courteously, I would have been very cool. On the other hand, her dog's unsupervised freakout tells me that she's not actively training it and had no idea what I was doing, and I suppose she had a reasonable expectation that neighbors won't linger at her property line as her dog demonstrates clear distress. Am I the asshole?

**Side notes:** I don't think we should debate dog breed stuff. It's an interesting conversation, but it requires a level of depth that's hard to reach in a sub this big. But I'm happy to answer questions. No dog tax because she's recognizable."	Asshole	0	0
bx2pqb	2019-06-05 13:43:59	km70052	AITA for arguing with my bf's housemate about my ESA?	"So I just started dating this guy, we really click, he's great, yadda yadda. He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.

Until this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?

So I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen me a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where I'm more likely to have anxiety so of course I wanted her there.

After going back and forth she was basically like, ""look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.""

While in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with me and I guess broke or chewed a chair. I'm fine with paying for those things if me and my bf stay together, but I kinda don't want to because if she'd just let my dog stay with me it wouldn't have even happened and because my bf didn't really take my side against his housemate and said it would be best if I don't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.

AITA for getting into it with her?

&#x200B;

EDIT: For the people focused on me not wanting to pay, I said I didn't want to, not that I won't, but as I said in the comments:  The chewing in the backyard, I didn't even see, so I'm not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers my bf sent me a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to me. I still get that I should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.

ALSO: My argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than my dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't ""just a pet"". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that. That's why I said she totally missed my point. But whoever that person is that says a service animal CAN'T is an asshole which is why I think she is the asshole."	Asshole	0	0
bx2o5e	2019-06-05 13:39:37	helpmeiamretarded	AITAfor telling my boyfriend (21 male) that he needs to set some boundaries with his mother.	"Edit: People keep asking about insurance, we live in UK and the procedure and all past and future apointments reguarding his teeth were free. 

At the moment my boyfriend is waiting to have his wisdom teeth removed, because of the placement his needs to be sadated but should only take 30 minutes. He has a preop in a few days and he asked me to come with him to both the pre-op and to comfort him while they give him the needle.

When he told his mum it did not go as planned, first she said that I should wait in the waiting room because it would look stupid if all 3 of us go in together, when he said she can wait instead or just go get coffee and come back once we are done she got agetated (edit: i meant agravated) and said ""your brother let me in the room whenever he had to go, why cant you? Besides I am your next of kin"" he got annoyed and said that if i am not with him then he just wont go to it, she said ""fine all 3 of us will go in for your pre op"" she was pissed.

I tried telling him that it is insane that she wont let him either do it alone or with someone else, and that in the future there will be a time where he might feel too uncomftable with her being there for check ups. I also said that if he wants her there for comfort then I will drop the subject, be he was the one who asked me to be there. And he told me of his needle phobia and knows that in the past she has not helped with stress in that situation. He said that it is just easier to comprimise and let her sit in because she doesnt like being told no. I told him to grow a back bone and tell her how he feels and asked him what he plans on doing when he is in his thirties?? He got annoyed with me and I feel like I should drop the subject. Am i an asshole?? Or controlling??? (I feel like i am pushing it)

Also to clarify we have been together for over 3 years, its not like I am a new gf cus i would understand why she wouldnt want me there in that situation.

Update: He has decided to try one more time to get her to understand it from his perspective, but he told me if it did not go as plan he is going to catch her off guard at the preop, the plan is when the doc calls his name he wants to stand up and say loudly ""mum can you stay here and my and OP will go in"" aparently she hates making a scene (he told me in the past she would always wait untill they were alone foe her to argue) i personally think this will cause an issue between them but it is his call and i already voiced my opinion on the plan. 

I did apologise for telling him to grow a back bone and he thanked me and said i had a point. Thank you for the advice.

Also, to the people who basically told me he needs to man up, you all need to learn that it is not just children that are scared of things, it is okay to be scared as an adult."	Not the A-hole	0	0

2 years ago , we just bought a house, got a new rug, got it all clean.  And this couple (wife's friends) came over for a visit.  I don't know if they were invited or they invited themselves.   In any case.  They brought their big fat gross dog without asking.  They say ""it's ok, he is like our son"".

But then they proceed to shoo our two geriatric cats into the bedroom and close the door (blocking them from food and water and litter box).  And allowing their dog to roam the new house.

I am trying not to show my obvious discomfort  but  ... then i hear that gross dog barfing sound.. and it starts to puke all over the new rug.  1 , 2 , 3 x.   The couple just slapped a paper towel on top of the puke spot after rubbing it  in,  thanks.  I couldn't take it anymore and just dropped out of the social interaction and went to clean the rug properly.

After they left, i was like, fuck that, i don't want that couple over ever again.

And wife said i was an asshole.   And that couple got all butthurt, thinking i was being mean to their son .

&#x200B;

wife and her friends have made up since then.

&#x200B;

Yesterday on FB, saw a post they had gone to the hospital to visit another friend who just had a baby.

There is a picture, in the fucking hospital.  the friend is in her hospital gown with hospital socks , the baby looks like it just came out within the last couple hours.   and here this couple is,  holding up their fat disgusting dog next to this newborn baby.  i dont even know how it got into the hospital in the first place (the husband tells everyone its an emotional support dog and i quote ""i need him for my loneliness"" and somehow that lets him get away with bringing it into places that usually dont allow dogs)  but anyway, my question is...

am i crazy?  is that not too much?  i mean ok bringing it to someones house without asking is one thing, but ...bringing it to a new born baby on the day it is born... and  holding up this fat disgusting tub of shit of a dog right next to it.   im sure its safe health wise... but theres just some social contract  to not do it right?? like washing your hands after you pee  or not double dipping.  just things society  expects right?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:  i guess , another reason why this story also came up is that MY friend,  brought his kid and dog over yesterdray.   and it was 100x worse than the story above.   and im not banning my friend (though i kind of want to).   they went to the beach immediately before coming over.   the kid and dog were both covered in sand.   this dog was more spry than the previous dog, and it was jumping all over the new couch and blankets slobbering and getting sand everywhere.... i was thinking gross dog again.   but by the time they left i actually realized it was the dog was the least gross of the 3.  he(kid) went all over the place leaving piles of sand.   i even found a mussle shell.    then my friend shows me a video ... his kid is doing hte breast stroke with all his clothes on , in the sand...   and this dog is young, so it actually chased our 16 year old cats around.    i was really disappointed in My friend... but since this was the second time this happened.   i thought... seriously am i crazy, is it normal to just bring your dog over to peoples houses without asking?  maybe thats just the way of the land."

bx2m37	2019-06-05 13:34:04	JaJH	AITA For my Choices at Wineries and Breweries?	"So, I figured I'd ask a pretty low-drama question on here for a bit of a change of pace from the norm. My wife and I have very different tastes when it comes to alcohol, especially beers and wines. Our area also has lots of small wineries and breweries scattered around. We like to visit them occasionally on the weekends, and we'll do tastings if we've never been to a place before.

&#x200B;

Now, most wineries in my experience (and some breweries) will have a choice of tasting menus. We usually both choose the option that we think we'll enjoy more and since we have very different tastes in wine, that results in us picking different menus. In my mind, it's a win-win for us because we not only get to drink stuff we'll probably like, we also get to try each others and end up getting to sample most (or all) of their selections that way. Occasionally, I'll find one on my wife's list that I really like, and vice versa. Lately, I've started to notice that this behavior seems to annoy the winery staff. They tend to be colder with us, spend less time talking about the wine, and don't pour as generously as they do to the other people around us. I've noticed this at the last few wineries we've been to, even when they're not otherwise busy.

&#x200B;

So are we the assholes? Is it generally considered some sort of winery faux pas to not pick the same tasting menus? Or have we just had bad luck with our winery staff?

EDIT: There's a bit of a discussion below about how my wife and I go through the tastings - We do both simultaneously, so say there are 5 wines per list, my wife and I both get pour #1, try ours, discuss with the staff and then, while we're waiting for them to get the next bottles, try each others. Pour #2 comes, process repeats, etc. Just like a restaurant, I'm sure the winery is interested in a quick turnover at the bar, and I feel like it would also needlessly extend our stay up there to go all the way through one list, and then all the way through another."

bx2imw	2019-06-05 13:24:19	bagbalm108	AITA for expecting my boyfriend to leave our parking space empty for when I come home from a trip super late	"Background: My boyfriend and I moved into a new place a few months ago, and I asked for the one parking spot because my car is newer. He was okay with that but asked to use it sometimes to fix his car, which of course was fine. He only has had time to fix his car on weekends, which has free street parking in our neighborhood, so I never bothered to change my street parking permit from the previous neighborhood so that I could still go visit friends until it expires in a few months. Fast forward a few months, and we got into a big completely unrelated argument but, as a sort of penance, I offered him the space full time. He declined. So I still kept my previous street parking pass on.

The issue: I just spent a few days out of town to visit family and parked my car at the airport. I had a late flight coming in and didn’t get home until 1am, where I found that he was parked in the parking spot. I was annoyed mostly because street parking isn’t as easy to find at night, and I spent 15 minutes driving around the neighborhood looking for a spot. Luckily (and maybe unfortunately), we have people who randomly sit in their cars at weird hours of the night and then drive off for no reason (that I can tell) across the street, (unsure what is happening there), and someone happened to leave right in front of our house. I got home and into bed annoyed but decided I wasn’t going to bring it up because why bother. But the next morning, I asked him if he could switch our cars because my street parking permit was not updated yet. I have it, I just haven’t changed it out for the reason previously mentioned. Also I don’t drive stick which is why he needed to move his own. He was doing a training at home for the day, so I figured it wouldn’t be too much of an ask to move my car too. I didn’t realize his training started at 8 (I asked at 7:55), so that was my bad and I apologized for that. He ended up switching them but made a huff about it and said I was entitled because I expected the parking space to be only mine. I told him he could have it 24/7 if it suits him (something I have previously offered) but that I would need to change out my parking tag out, which would take 5 minutes. At this point, I was kind of annoyed myself, so I told him it would’ve been nice to have that spot open for my late arrival from the airport. He told me to just go to work because I was annoying with how entitled I was and how it’s supposed to be a 50/50 relationship and that he has previously had travel where he had to come home and park far away (albeit, in those situations, we lived in a different neighborhood where we had no parking spot and both had to park in far away street parking if we came home late). I walked out of the house feeling like I did something wrong, but I don’t know exactly. Perhaps someone can throw out some other perspectives."	Asshole	0	0

He sends over the money (P500 or about $10) and I send over the cards. He receives it after 3 days and he tells me that the cards I sent him were fake. I reply saying sorry, you did say they were good. I then asked him if he wanted his money back (provided he returns the cards first). He says No need. It’s up to me if i decide to send the money back and he no longer messages me back (he didn’t block me though, our conversation just ends there). 

I asked my parents at the time and they send don’t send anything since he did confirm they were good before I sent it over.

bx2flj	2019-06-05 13:15:53		AITA for sleeping in the other room because my girlfriend was on her period?	"Last month, my girlfriend got her period in the middle of the night. Her period is pretty irregular and she's had no end of issues regarding pain - some months she faints and can't work. 
She understands that I'm not good with period-talk so doesn't ever really mention it, other than when she's struggling to cope with the pain. 

When her period came last month, she was asleep and we woke up to the bed sheets bloody and it knocked me sick. I understand it's natural but I woke up, went to cuddle her and felt wet on the bed. I woke her up to tell her she was bleeding and she nonchalantly stripped the bed like it was no big deal and even laughed about it. It made me gag when I saw the blood on the mattress and I went to the bathroom gagging, she called me a child. 

This month, she came on in the morning and later that night we were getting ready for bed. I told her I was gonna sleep in the spare room and told her that I couldn't cope with the chance of waking up to that shit again. She called me a child again and said she had warning this time so she'd wear a tampon/pad. I said I still didn't want to risk it. She laughed at me and said I was being stupid and I asked how she'd feel if I wet/shit the bed every month and would she sleep in the bed with me knowing that would happen? She said it's just blood, it happened once and these things happen. She said that even if she did bleed in the bed, it's her that has to clean it, her that feels the pain and her that has to go through it every month. I still refused to sleep in the bed. 

That was last week and now she won't sleep in bed with me. I have this thing where i sweat a lot in my sleep and now she's being petty and sleeping in the spare room saying she doesn't want to risk waking up to my sweat. I told her this is totally different but she's being stubborn as hell and won't sleep with me until I apologise for being ""so childish"".

AITA here?! 

**TL;DR** My gf leaked in bed on her period. Since then I won't sleep in bed with her when she's ""on"". Now she's being petty and won't sleep in bed with me and says I'm acting like a childish asshole."		1	0
bx2fdk	2019-06-05 13:15:19	apologizeorleave	AITA for asking my husband to apologise to my parents or leave their house because he ruined our daughters birthday party by not picking her up on time?	"First off this is not a validation post. I'm only here because my husband thinks I'm an asshole. He even wants to reconsider our relationship now because of this petty incident. 

A couple of days ago, my parents decided to host our daughters birthday party. It was a special occasion because she was going to be 16. My daughter had some plans with her friends and we decided to host the party at night. We invited our extended family and friends and told them that the party would start at 7pm. 

My husband was supposed to pick her up on his way back from his workplace. Well, my husband and daughter were supposed to be there by 7, but they ended up arriving at 8. It was not much of a party without my daughter. We had to start late and my parents were really upset. Apparently, the traffic delayed him. I was really upset. I told him he should have started early. So I asked him to apologise to my parents for what he had done, but he refused and decided to walk out. After learning what happened, my daughter walked out with him and they ruined everything. 

They now refuse to talk to me. I think they should appreciate what my parents tried to do for her. I also think my daughter acted like a brat. AITA here?"	Asshole	0	0

bx29qk	2019-06-05 12:59:17	dragonfrvit	AITA for snapping at my housemate over toilet roll?	"I (22F) have lived with a housemate (22M) and two other girls, both in their early twenties since September ‘18. We’re all full time postgrad students at university, so all fairly mature and pretty busy adults.

For background: I’ve pretty much taken on the role of cleaner in the house - especially in the bathroom, which no one else has ever touched - but that’s not my issue because this is something I’ve chosen to do. I’m usually of the mentality that if something needs doing I’ll just do, especially if it benefits me anyway, so I don’t mind being the house cleaner. It is a little frustrating that I pay for all the cleaning products myself - which over the last 9 months has added up - but again that’s my choice so I haven’t ever complained about it.

I guess like every student house we’re falling into a toilet roll debate. The one housemate F (22M) never contributes to buying toilet roll. It’s almost always me or the other two girls. We also know he’s aware of this every time there is no toilet roll in the house, as soon as it’s replaced we get a message in our group from him saying “Thanks for getting the toilet roll! I’ll get it next time!” - but he never does. Rinse and repeat.

Recently he’s been home more than the rest of us because his course is finished. The other evening I was about to head out with friends and stopped off in the bathroom, thinking all would be well as there was a half roll that morning. I was wrong, there was only empty tubes. I was pretty frustrated so I was muttering to myself as I went back up when F knocked on my door, asked if I wanted to use the toilet, and offered me some HAND TISSUES from his room because “that’s what he’s been using today”

... I was pretty angry. I refused his hand tissues and told him I didn’t want them, telling him that was getting ridiculous and I wanted him to actually go out and buy toilet roll and contribute for once. I was pretty snappy and shut the door on him, which I do kinda regret. I saw him in the kitchen today and usually we would chat but today he ignored me, so I know we’re at odds. 

AITA? I had been out on campus working all day whereas he had been home, so clearly he knew there was no toilet roll left. AND there is a corner shop literally 3 doors down. It would take probably 2 minutes total to buy toilet roll. 

Should I have just got it myself? Was it silly and petty to snap at him so much over something as small as toilet roll?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bx26ty	2019-06-05 12:50:45	aitaexwife123	AITA for making my husband take calls from his ex in the garage	"Updated at the bottom! Husband thinks I’m asserting myself in MY house but I feel like it’s for the best. Sorry if it’s long, trying to explain it well. Tell me if I’m being an asshole. 

Husband has two sons from a previous marriage. I have two daughters. Boys are 12 and 8; girls are 8 and 4. Bit of a Brady bunch situation we got going on.

My ex husband and I coparent very well. No issues being in the same place. Was hard and took some family therapy, but for all my girls know, mom and dad are buddies. 

Husband and his ex? Not so much. I’m usually on his side, as she can be petty. She talks bad about us to the boys. 

Anyways, the boys don’t quite see me as a mother figure, more like a buddy. I don’t want to force it. Oldest cuddled up to me on the couch one night while dad was working and asked if I liked his mom. I said “of course. She is a good mom and I got two cool kids out of the deal.” He then starts to tell me a couple things mom has said about me, and that it hurts his feelings when they argue. And that it’s scary hearing his dad argue with his mom. He’s about to be a teenager and I just said “your mom and dad are adults and should handle themselves better than that. But everyone loves you and your brother, and that’s why it gets heated” that was about it.

Now, I can’t control what goes on in that house, short of a court order saying to stop talking shit, but I do feel entitled to telling husband to chill in my own. When husband got home, kids were asleep, and I laid it all out. That they’re hurting their kids, and I get why he gets angry, but he needs to be a adult and quit perpetuating it. Every time she calls, there’s an argument between the two of them. So I said, new rule, take that shit to the garage when she calls. He thinks I’m asserting myself and not letting him discuss matters with his ex in his own house, because it was my house previously. Told him I don’t give a shit about him discussing matters with his ex, but I’m tired of hearing them arguing in front of my kids and his own, and that is just going to be how it is here from now on until they can get it together. 

He’s angry with me. I’m getting a “it’s not your business” vibe, which he hasn’t said, but anyways, I felt like I had to do something.

UPDATE: kid free last night (yeah!) and we had a chance to discuss our argument. I was demanding and patronizing, and apologized. We eventually came up with a different plan. 

We spoke with his attorney this morning, and he’s going write up an agreement prohibiting the type of bullshit detailed above. Custody agreement is already in place, and if we decide we want to deviate from that, it’s up to the other parents discretion, but special consideration be given to things that benefit the kids. If the matters are financial, we’ll let attorneys handle that. We plan on asking her to meet with her to discuss in person. I suspect she’ll decline, but we will make sure she knows that if she does decline,  the attorneys will handle. No more petty bullshit. 

As for the comment about who’s house it is. He admitted that there are some insecurities. Poor guy was raised with some pretty strict gender roles being reinforced, and brought up education and my career. (Y’all, he is quiet and reserved. For him to say these things was shocking) He is more intelligent than me in countless ways, and works his ass off taking care of me and all of our kids. The way he has accepted my girls, and tries to take care of things is just...I can’t really express it. Hurtful to know that he feels insecure sometimes, but hearing him open up in that way was refreshing and...attractive. I like him pretty good, and will definitely keep him.

bx243n	2019-06-05 12:42:54	ZWE_Punchline	"AITA for not wanting to speak to my friends anymore over a ""racist"" joke?"	"Edit: I’ll stop using “cunt”; it’s got a less sexist meaning in the UK but that’s not much of an excuse for it. Apologies.

When I moved to uni I quickly became friends with my flatmate, Tony. He's white but listens to a lot of rap/grime music. Sometimes he jokes about how I'm ""not black"" because I prefer older music and don't act like a ""stereotypical"" black guy. Not to mention, there'll be times where ""nigga"" comes up in a song or whatever and he just says it without caring. I'm not gonna lie, this bothers me. I've confronted him about it a few times and he always says he ""forgets he's around a black person."" Make of that what you will. I also became buds with another guy, Mark. Mark's a decent guy but he keeps asking me for the ""n-word pass"" as a joke and it's starting to get on my nerves. Mark has an asian girlfriend, which is important later.

Me, Tony, Mark, and a few other mates were pre-drinking to go out last night. We were all pretty drunk, but not drunk enough to do or say anything we didn't mean (the night was pretty young). Everyone in the room was white, except for me. Mark made a racist joke (quinted his eyes with his fingers pretending to be asian) and everyone laughed, but I was taken aback. I was thinking *did he seriously just do that?* and I called him out on it in front of everyone. They all told me to lighten up, because I ""talk about race all the time,"" but only because they're always joking about how I must have a huge dick because I'm black or asking for the n-word pass - most of the time, I'm telling them that it's not that funny and to leave it alone. I said that none of them have the right to make racist jokes like that and Mark told me that it wasn't aimed at me, so I shouldn't be offended by it. I told him to fuck off, and Tony started defending Mark - when I said that Tony wasn't in a position to talk either because he clearly doesn't care about saying nigger around me, he just looked at me and said, ""that's a you problem, not a me problem."" I called him a cunt and he said that's cool, and the room was silent for a minute or two.

I went out on my own after they came back and Mark told me I'm like a brother to him and we're good friends and all that, trying to make up I guess. He said that he was one of three white people in his high school before he came to uni so he knew how it felt to get discriminated against. I asked him why he made the joke if that were the case, and the he actually stood there and said that it wasn't aimed at me so I shouldn't be offended. 

I told him I wasn't having it because jokes like this get cracked way too often for my liking and if he couldn't understand why I'd be offended by a racist joke, even if it wasn't aimed at me, then I didn't see him as a friend anymore. He said that he doesn't care (I guess the whole friend thing was bullshit) and then I went back inside, grabbed my booze, and drank on my own in my room. Did I overreact here?

I have a female friend (20F) who still follows my ex abuser (28M) on social media, and regularly likes his posts. He’s a musician, and posted a song with really malicious lyrics about me, gloating about how he cheated, she liked the post, unsure if she listened to the song. Generally, she likes most of his photos etc. 

I haven’t really spoken publicly about my experience with him, mainly because I feel showing my hurt and anger will fuel him and I know better. In the heat of the moment I did make a low key post that was generally about emotional abuse. Red flags, what to look for, that kind of thing. Anyone who knew me well (said friend included) knew I was referring to my recently ended relationship. She even replied to this post, shared that she had experienced something similar. I saw her as an ally.

Flash forward and this friend has been commenting and dm-ing me compliments on Instagram, “cutie” “love this outfit” whatever. And I’ve been ignoring them, because it hurts that she’s still liking my abusers mean posts about me. I unfollowed her after a while and thought she’d get the message. Obviously not, she’s still commenting on all my stuff and I’m starting to feel mean ignoring it. 

I get that now it’s veering into passive aggressive territory. Usually unfollowing people just results in them unfollowing me back and we both move on. I didn’t expect this reaction and so now I feel a bit stuck.

I’ve drafted a message I was thinking of sending. I came up with this:

Hey (friend), I’m sorry, but it makes me feel really uncomfortable that you still interact with (abuser’s) posts on insta, especially when he posts openly misogynistic songs about me. I understand that it’s ultimately my problem, but I can’t help feeling that way until my PTSD gets better. I’m trying to actively distance myself from people who still associate with him, for the sake of my mental health. It’s not anything more personal than that, I still think you’re lovely, but it’s a boundary I have to have.

Would I be an asshole for doing this? Am I being kind of naive? I’m not trying to act like everything revolves around me, but her actions do feel like a betrayal. Am I micro managing? Should I just accept people can do what they want? I feel like I’m acting somewhat entitled, I honestly don’t know how much to expect from my friends in this situation."	Not the A-hole	0	0

He didn't act entitled to it, but my older brother seemed to think i owed it to him, especially because i got mine free when i was his age.

so back in 2014, my little brother turned 18 and graduated high school. He lived with our mom at the time and they lived very poor lives. My father owns his own business and me and my little brother work there. My little brother was paying rent to our mom since it was only him and her, and the rent cost him most of what he made at work each month which was about $300. Our mom was very greedy too, so she would take every penny he had. at the time, he found out i was selling my 2003 kia. i told him since he did graduate, i would sell it to him for $2,000 instead of my original asking price, which was $2500. it had minor problems but it ran okay. As soon as my older brother got word of this, he was furious with me. he said back when i was 16 and in high school, he bought a 2005 toyota (about new btw) for about $3000 and payed it off to give to me since i was about to graduate in 2 years. He said why should my little brother have to work for a car when i didn't. i ended up selling the car to him anyways since he said he had been saving money to buy one, but he asked why couldn't i just let him have it since i had 3 cars at the time. (two were mine and one was my SO's.) Plus he had said i got a car for free too, which upset me. i had told him he needed to work for things in life. did i sound too hypocritical or was i okay?"

Let me start by saying I've always had a rather distant relationship with my family. I'm not the one to seek out communication with them, but most of us are that way. That is, aside from my grandmother. She's always been kind of the matriarch of our family - all finances and financial decisions have been her, and this has given her a feeling of incredible self importance, at least that's what I think. She's always calling, always trying to find out from other people what we're (we as in me and my two siblings) doing because we've just stopped telling her. 


Recently I moved back to my home town after living in the big city for a number of years, and my current residence is neighbouring my grandmother's house. This meant that she expected I go visit her every single day, staying there talking and doing her housework for hours a day, didn't matter if I had work that day. That's because my brother, when he lived home, and my father, when he still was alive, were doing exactly that - going there sitting for hours and letting themselves to be basically bullied. I have a reason to believe this was a contributing factor to my father's death by his own hand three years ago, and grandmother is still saying, how he could leave her. 


What I'm trying to say is that she's an incredibly harsh person to be around. I'll give you a few examples:

* at my father's funeral she snapped at me how I haven't done anything with my life and basically am nothing. She had to be shushed by a distant relative;
* she talks about my siblings and me behind our backs. My sister's fiance once caught her in a phone conversation telling the other person how they shouldn't trust sister's fiance and how he's a ""sketchy person"". She tried to deny all of the conversation on the spot, and still expects him to do what she wants despite them living in another country;
* she thinks that I should spend time with her because she has given me money for things like rent and food in the past while I was living in the big city and studying in uni. 

So, I don't respond to her phone calls anymore. My brother sometimes visits but I don't ask. 

For clarity, she's in her eighties and has a caretaker.

\>i walk into a hotel and the lady at the front desk ""Hi, Can you please help me out? I'm not from here and i'm kinda lost. Could you please call a taxi for me?""

\>She agrees

\>while on the phone with the taxi she asks for my room number, to which i reply with ""i'm not staying here'

\>she makes an odd disgusted kinda face and continues talking to the person on the phone.

\>she then hangs up and says "" what you just did was very rude, but your taxi is coming. Please wait over there, I have work to do.""

Can someone explain to me how that was rude? There was nothing else i could've done and i needed help. I explained my problem and she agreed to call a cab. I feel kinda offended with how i was treated honestly but i'd like to know what you guys think.

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** (copied reply) I forgot to clarify. I had somewhere to be but it was raining really hard and i didn't want to be late.

i was planning to walk but that went out of the window because i didn't have an umbrella. i was short on time at that point and i wasn't sure what to do.

i do see how i was wrong though now, so thank you all. lesson learnt.

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** I see now how this was rude. i didn't think of it that way at the time. Thanks to everyone replying. I wont make the same mistake again.

&#x200B;

**Final update:** 

i followed [/u/jennifer538](https://old.reddit.com/u/jennifer538)

 advice and went back to the hotel. I bought a box of chocolate and went  back and apologized. I said that i now understood my mistake and that i  was really sorry wasting her time and possibly a ride for a different  paying guest.

she said it was okay, but she did not want the chocolates. I told her to have a nice day and left.

I appreciate everyone giving constructive criticism. I was in the  wrong, so thank you for making me see. I'm young and stupid and i want  to be a better person.

I haven't spoken to him in a year but he has apologized

It really made me feel horrible about myself and it does bother me a bit to this day but I don't talk about it.

bx1nj2	2019-06-05 11:50:19		AITA for venting about my boyfriend?	So I've recently felt guilty for ranting to my mom and best friend about my boyfriend due to recent issues between us. I won't elaborate exactly what they are in this post, because that's not the point here, but to give a TL;DR we have a bit of a communication issue rn and he is unable to give me much of any attention, which means I can't properly talk to HIM about my problems because he is rarely here. I have expressed some genuine issues I have with him and in temporary fits of anger, have said some hurtful things I did not mean about him to my best friend and mom. I now feel guilty for saying things behind his back even though my best friend has said that my anger is justified. I would much rather talk about things with him ofc, but as I said he's barely present and at the time I just needed someone close to rant to, but that doesn't mean I don't feel bad. I'm not sure if I gave enough info to get a proper judgement, but if I did, AITA?		1	0

Roommate A texts me telling (not asking) me she is getting a dog at the end of the month. I say sorry, but I’m not comfortable with that. (Reasons being she dog sits for a living currently. She sleeps til noon and I can hear the poor pups crying to be let out for hours. Her cats cower in fear for days because of the dogs resulting in them pooping and peeing in my closet. I’ve told her I don’t feel like she’s being a responsible pet owner before and it didn’t go over well. I caught her talking behind my back to Roommate B. There was a big fight but slowly things went back to normal) Roommate A says well Roommate B & Roommate C approve so I’ll be getting the dog and says she’s “very very excited! emoji emoji emoji”

I call the landlord because our lease says no pets - she keeps the cats on the down low. Landlord says Roommate A has told her the dog is an emotional support. There’s not much she can do about it but she said she is willing to cut me out of the lease early - with the approval of all roommates as their rent will go up until they find a replacement OR I can sell my lease for someone to fill my spot. All roommates vote for me selling my contract, ok works for me. Roommate A decided she will post it to her network too thinking it should be a team effort. I begrudgingly accepted help since I just want out ASAP. But a few days later I asked if they had set up any tours, they all said no.

I however, got a response right away from Potential Roommate who lives out of state but starting a job soon near us. She sends her friend to come take a tour and also meets 2 of the roommates. The friend is awesome and all 3 of us agree we love her. Potential Roommate sees the picture, loves the house and asks to move in via message. I say perfect! I send the landlord her information.

I tell the roommates individually hey I’m going to let this person take over my lease. Roommate C said cool! and chatted with me like normal. Roommate A says well we will meet her first and hopefully we like her but no promises. Roommate B freaks the fuck out and starts crying and runs out the door and now won’t answer my apology text or answer her door when I knock. I assume she won’t talk to me until her and Roommate A can sit down with me together since she doesn’t have a backbone and basically acts as a minion to Roommate A.

I get it. In an ideal world we would have met the New Roommate herself before agreeing to anything. But social media tells us a lot, we met her friend and she went to the same university as 3 of us. She’s normal with a stable job. Roommate C was also found online at the beginning of the lease. Only Roommate A and myself met her first for less than 10 min and we all agree she’s been awesome.

She’s like a sister to me (related but not siblings) and I love her but I’m flummoxed.

She’s disappointed that neither I nor her parents are happy about the announcement. 

She’s had a pregnancy scare with every person she’s slept except one. 

This is the second incident with this guy.  

She’s knows how to use plan and birth control and has used both in the past.   After her previous scares she vowed to always use birth control and condoms. 

She says she thought it would be ok this time because she was close to her period. So she was on her no patch week and had not yet started her period.  

Last time she had a pregnancy scare with this guy was right after they broke up and no matter how many negative tests she did it took her two full months to get accustomed to the idea that she wasn’t pregnant.  She thinks this kid is a miracle and while we acknowledge that both her and the man do have issues that make it harder to get pregnant they were in no position to do this.  

She has a gig based job that fluctuates greatly and had to have her parents cosign for her apartment and recently her new car so she could keep her job after her old car took a shit. She’s also the adult equivalent of pig pen and was kicked out of her last apartment for lack of cleanliness after multiple warnings.  

He’s been unemployed for at least a few years. He has a bum shoulder but doesn’t qualify for disability.  

He largely refuses to leave the house as he’s apparently too smart for the world at large, his words not mine.

When they dated he expected her to compromise but never did so himself.   

When they were together he told her that he wanted a marriage and kids and they decided to stop using birth control. They dated for all of three months. Without provocation he changed his mind and dumped her less than a month later while she was working making a delivery to his house. 

Oh and he’s married with no legal separation or formal divorce proceedings in the works despite being separated and living in different states the last few years.  

I’d set her up with someone who wants marriage and would have treated her with more respect and would have wanted any children they had together but she insisted on sleeping with this guy until they became exclusive. Which was her prerogative but they should have used condoms since neither is medically sterile.  

To be clear what’s done is done and we do not expect her to have an abortion nor do we want her to. We just want her to start acting like an adult (she’s 30+) and start being more responsible. Right now she’s being a bratty teenager and gets mad at us when we don’t respond to pregnancy related things with her level of excitement."	Not the A-hole	1	0

"So there’s this girl in my year, who I am close friends with, who had a falling out with some other friends of mine. I don’t know exactly what the falling out was about but that doesn’t matter to this story. So last week (29/5/19) I was on a bus with her and she was shit talking the girls she was angry at and saying stuff like “I hope Girl #1’s boyfriend cheats on her”. 

She also claimed that she “didn’t care about the drama anymore” but is perfectly fine with badmouthing the girls she was in the drama with.  I thought at the time that if she’s willing to talk shit about her supposed friends for doing something dumb, she’s willing to do that to anyone including myself. I kept silent about my thoughts as I didn’t want her to be mad at me. 

Cut to today (5/6/19) when she has “forgiven” girl #1 but is still mad at girl #2 and she’s complaining about how she “doesn’t have any friends” and “everyone hates her” or something along those lines when I (and another friend) had enough and basically called her out on her bull and pointed out how she was a hypocrite. After this she ran off in a huff. My friend thought we had been a little too harsh on her despite the fact we just told her the truth in her manipulative acts.

Now she’s mad at me and won’t look me in the eyes and girl #1 told me she was badmouthing me behind my back."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We date for 5 years, fall in love, she Ofc ""forgets"" to take her contraceptives and gets pregnant. Being an old fashioned type of guy and in love, we get married.

Fast forward 6 years and I'm out here busting my ass 7 days a week so she can wear diamonds, sapphires, hold the latest fashioned bags, go on the most exclusive vacations in the country etc..

Don't get me wrong, her parenting skills are wonderfall - she has a maid and kid goes to one of the most exclusive schools in the country. But, it seems I'm out here fending for myself - my breakfast consists of a cigarette (told her many times about that) every time I ask her to ""help me"" do something, she either scowls at me or gives me some kind of shart excuse and here I was thinking that a stay at home mom should probably cook dinner - no, and on the rare occasion it tastes awful.

So after a 5 week stretch of me working 7 days, I confront her (not the first time) about doing f' all for me and why must I work for her when there would be so many other girls who'd love to be in her position. Her response is always the same, about me ""cheating"" : when my dad died, she decided to leave me for over a month, take my kid away to another ""state"" if you will, and perhaps, in her opinion, I moved on a bit too quickly for her liking, pretty much hitting anything that moved. But later we decided to resolve our issues for the betterment of our child.

bx1ew3	2019-06-05 11:19:23	AberrantConductor	WIBTA for telling [M]y mother she can't wear a cream/white suit to my wedding?	"My fiancée and I recently went to my mother's house for an engagement celebration dinner. 

My mother proudly showed my fiancée the very pale ""cream"" (white) suit that she has worn to many family gatherings - weddings/christenings etc. This suit was accidentally ruined in a freak ironing incident some time ago.

My mother told my fiancée that she's planning on having a similar suit made for our wedding.

My fiancée is not a bridezilla - we have had multiple compromises and productive conversations and none of the usual bridezilla clichés have come up. However she was always beholden to the tradition that ONLY the bride wears white at a wedding. I know this is a thing and it's not unreasonable as far as I can see. We're far enough ahead from the wedding that she has over a year to find something to wear.

So - WIBTA? I know that modern attitudes to traditions change but I'm genuinely surprised that my mother doesn't know or ignores this tradition. 

Tldr: I want to tell my mother not to wear a brand new white/cream suit that she doesn't even own yet to my wedding.

"I saw a car making aggressive, jerky turns and thought to myself “I hope I’m not riding with that asshole.” Turns out I was. I wish I had just declined the ride now. Hindsight 20/20. 

I always say a polite “how are you?”/“you doing alright?” if asked how I’m doing. And when I did he had a huge emotional outburst about having received a big ticket that could prevent him from driving again and he thought he hadn’t done anything wrong and thought he had dashcam footage to prove it. He was so emotional and agitated because it happened 10min before he picked me up. 

He kept looking back at me instead of the road and the driving was jerky because he kept drifting into other lanes. Several times he took both hands off the wheel to gesticulate and then had to grab suddenly before we bumped into a parked car or the next lane.  

I did what I could to calm him down. Of note, we were pasing through an unsafe neighborhood and I felt equally unsafe in the car and out. He eventually told me about his money issues and how even fighting the ticket would cause strain. 

And I feel for him but the driving terrified me. I haven’t left a rating yet because I don’t want to be an asshole. But I also think I should report the unsafe driving. Keep at least one hand on the wheel, right?

There's this friend group that I joined by a friend of mine. In this friend group there's this guy that's been there since the beggining. He's a cool guy, I don't think he's a bad person or anything, but he just … Lies. A fuckton.

It's always mostly trivial lies that don't matter, but he just keeps doing it. He grabs people's attention only to make up some bullshit story about how his uncle is a capo in italian mafia and gifted him an assault rifle once (THIS IS LITERALLY SOMETHING HE SAID TO ME)

Absolutely nobody else in the group seems to be annoyed by this. Hell I'm starting to believe some of them actually believe him. It's not that he's said a couple of hard to believe stories … He's done this for years. He just keeps making shit up and it legitimately bothers the hell out of me because this group is made of his closest friends. It'd be one thing if he lies to a girl he wants to impress, whatever, but why keep lying to his friends?

It doesn't help that every time I try to confront him on some things I can disprove (he even included me in one of his bullshit stories once) he gets defensive.

I talked this over with some other friends from other groups and nobody else seems to have a real problem with it. They think I'm making a big deal out of it when it isn't. And I'm thinking… Yeah, maybe. So this is why I'm asking reddit about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx1de6	2019-06-05 11:14:07	yoruji11	AITA for being cruel to my mom to get her to stop smoking?	"For a couple of years now, my mom has been trying to quit smoking. I and my mom have a great relationship, and I and the rest of my family has tried to get her to stop smoking. She's been trying to quit but... she's keeps going back to her usual routines.

I love my mom, and I don't want her to get cancer from smoking. She suggests getting onto vaping instead but I know it's just as bad as smoking, if not worse. I know the risks of second hand smoking, the thing I and my sister have been witness to for our lives to present date. So this morning, I just broke.

I told my mom that if she keeps smoking, I or my sister is gonna die by cancer ( I told her in the past I'm deathly afraid that she'll get lung cancer ) and that I don't want to die. And I don't want my sister to die.

She starts crying, I try to comfort her a little but I had to go because I had exams (currently on break ).

I only did what I did because maybe she'll listen. And try to stop. I know this is a cruel thing to say, especially to my mother but hopefully she'll listen, and I'll go to any extent to make her stop, for her sake.

Aita?

By the way, she refuses to go on any qutting group, or get any help for her addiction.

Edit : Thank you all for the comments. I see now I was being crueler than I imagined. I and my mom talked about it for a bit, she said that she's gonna try vaping. At least it's better than smoking a normal cigarette. But actions speak louder than words so I'm gonna wait it out for a bit because she's made empty promises about it before.

Yes, I know how hard it is to stop. I've been with her and others like her, all my life. Is it wrong I want my mom to live longer? I know you can't stop it with a snap of a finger, and she's been 'quitting' since I was around 10, (I'm 16 ). But thank you for the comments.

Edit 2 : Thank you for all the comments. I and my mom have decided to try her on vaping ; I retract my comments from earlier, as some people pointed out vaping is much better than smoking. I see now how wrong I was in the situation I was in, and I'll better myself because of it. I can't thank you all enough for the good advice. I'm gonna try her with positive reinforcement, and try distract her from smoking for the meanwhile. Thank you all again so much. Have a good day everyone."	Asshole	0	0

When I first started doing it I was pretty depressed and didn’t leave the house. Now that I am feeling happier, have a boyfriend and have friends that moved back to our hometown, he nit picks and questions everything I do. Sometimes my aunt (52) helps, but she normally just buys him diapers once a week or something.

He purposely only asks me for things when I am about to leave to make me late. Anytime I leave the house he scoffs at me and if I come home any later than 9:30pm, he goes off on me about how selfish I am being. I leave parties, sports, dinner, and general social events to feed him at the times he wants and I usually end up leaving early even if someone else is there because of the anxiety I have from being constantly reprimanded. I am feeling extremely resentful that I cannot live my life and my anxiety and stress has peaked.

He took care of me as a child because my mom was a drug addict, and he tells me he gave up his life to take care of me. I feel like that’s fine and dandy, and I appreciate not being on the streets but most of my life was spent in deep depression because of the way he treated me. I gave up any semblance of a career to take care of him in this shit hole town. 

On the other side of things, I love my sister and wish I could be there for her more but I am not sure I am ready to be a mom. I am literally still a kid and I have so many psychological issues that it makes it extremely hard to parents. I also have literally $40 in my bank account.  I really don’t want to leave her and it makes my heart break but I am not sure if I am equipped to take care of a child.

This week I told my aunt that I was moving out and she started saying I’m making her life so much harder and that I should be staying and taking care of them.

One day, while we were chatting, he suddenly talks to me about some questionable topics... such as his abusive lifestyle, bully problems (he's still in high school), and he keeps mentioning about the ""feeling of betrayal that lurks inside him.""

At this point, I became concerned, since he's one of my closest friends at the moment. I kept giving him advice on how to keep things together, see a therapist, talk to your friends and family.

I really want him to get through all of this. I don't want to see my friend be in situations like these. I love him dearly and I'm grateful that I met him.

Three weeks later, he pings everyone in our group's server, and tells us that he can't take it anymore, and that he wants to end it all. He's been sending us pics showing his house which he trashed. He keeps threatening to record his death live in front of us.

None of us know what to do. As much as we want to try and help him, we just can't convince him not to do it.

Moments later, he decided to DM me and tell me about his situation, and that he can't deal with any of it. He's been continously sending me messages about it, and at this point I'm too afraid to even reply back.

I'll say it again. I really want to help him. But I can't do shit, and knowing me, I'll only make things worse. I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do now. I don't even know how he's doing right now, what his thoughts are.

My family have gone through some rough patches the past couple of months. Both my Mum and Grandpa have terminal cancer and they’ve both had a rocky past two months with their health, in and out of hospital, hardly out of bed, that sort of thing. My Mum was diagnosed when I was 8 so while this is definitely the worst I remember Mum’s sickness is my version of normal. Grandpa has taken a downhill slope very slowly so it wasn’t a shock either.

On top of that my parents have had to go away for business, I’ve been travelling to visit my BF 10 hours away a couple of times, life’s been busy. And while I didn’t want to nag or annoy I did try to keep my birthday in the back of everyone’s minds because honestly I could do with a little extra attention and 18’s pretty special. But all I’ve felt like I was doing was nagging, especially because my parents promised to shout me flights to my BF for my birthday instead of a party (though we’re still going out for dinner as a family). I kept looking at flights especially when they were discounted but my parents didn’t want to know, and now it won’t be happening until around August. 

Mum admitted to me yesterday she’d completely lost track and not only had gotten me nothing for my birthday, but neither had anyone else. Only my BF. She took me shopping today for Pandora charms because I told everyone that’s what I wanted. It’s the first time I’ve ever selected my own present and it felt a little less special.

My Dad (who’s a dickhead alcoholic) forgot my birthday COMPLETELY so when Mum told him she’d made a dinner reservation he flipped about how he hadn’t been included in that discussion (he had, he was just drunk at the time).

So honestly tomorrow doesn’t feel special, it doesn’t feel like this massive milestone 18 is supposed to be...it feels like a throw together. I know everyone’s health is important but after the shit I’ve gone through and done for everybody I just want a day, but doesn’t look like I’m getting it.

bx1c8z	2019-06-05 11:09:54		AITA For thinking we shared in my flat.	"Hey guys long time lurker first time poster. 

So I have a flat mate and I think he is somewhat of a control freak, I'm a very timid person who trips over his words easy so not good with confrontation so I need some feedback on if I'm the asshole in this situation as I can't argue my case in person.

We have lived together for about 2 years now and I'm going to share 3 situations that are a good way to give you an idea of what the issue is overall rather than struggle to remember ever instance it has happened.

1#. Milk.

I buy a large bottle of milk like the 2 litre ones, because it lasts longer and cheaper where I shop, for ages we shared milk but the issue is I always bout the large 2 litre bottles and my flat mate would buy the small 1/2 litre bottles.  Yet whenever I used the his milk he would always get mad over it, I said ""we share the milk"" he said yes but you have used most of it. Remember it's a small bottle so you do that with a bowl of cereal. So I said fine no more sharing milk.  So now we buy our own milk.

2#. Washing up tablets.

For ages I bought the washing up tablets for clothes, he would also use them, it didn't bother me. One day I get a rash on my leg about a year and a half in to us living in the flat and think it might be what I use on my clothes (it wasn't) so I buy new washing up tablets.  My flat mate didn't recognize what they were (despite being labeled and in plain sight above the washing machine) and buys what we used to use.  Since then I had used all mine up and since he used mine for over a year I used his about 3 times.  Till today he saw the box and had a go at me for using them, remember this was still the first box of washing up tablets he bought after using mine for a year and a half.

3#. Weed.

We both smoke bud, I try and say when possible let's go Half's, but I realised I smoke more so started buying my own supply.  If I ran out I would ask if I could borrow some and would always get the same answer ""no"" but he said I could always share his joint.  I try to do the same but Everytime I offer to role one he says no and will refuse to smoke mine and will only roll and smoke his own.  Recently he ran out and asked if he could borrow some I said no on the grounds he would never lend me any but I said we can share one.  He said he would roll it but I said it's fine I've got it.  He had what can only be described as a hissy fit, while we smoked it he just insulted it.  

I'm pretty sure we're going to both be called assholes cause despite being friends we can be petty with each other, but I think I'm not the asshole here, but then again I have a couple of issues that make me socially inept so I'm not sure."	No A-holes here	0	0

bx1bo5	2019-06-05 11:07:37	BlackBunny88	AITA for being mad my uncle didn't order transport	"I woke up in the morning preparing myself, knowing I have to write an exam today (5th June). I woke up early and was done in time. My transport was late and I didn't know why. They normally come at around 8am. I realized that he was running late when I waited until 8:10 and he still was not there. Since I didn't have airtime, I asked the lady who cleans at our house to call the transport guy. I couldn't hear him very well on the phone, but he complained about the office not wanting him to come fetch me. So I called my uncle who has been hiring transport for me from that shuttle service for the last couple of months.

I called him to tell him the guy was not there yet and I need to be at the venue before 8:30, because if come late I have to sign some form and won't be allowed to enter until 9:20 when we are supposed to write at 9am and won't be getting extra time. 
When I told him that he said every thing was fine and that I should just tell the people at the venue that I forgot to call my transport guy to pick me up. For the last couple of month the transport guy came 5 minutes earlier without me having to call him. In fact it was my uncle who forgot ordering the transport for today, when I for several weeks or days have been telling him when I am writing my exam. 

I don't recall him apologizing I might have missed that. Instead he implied it was my fault for not double checking and reminding him. He called again when the transport guy arrived at 8:30 am and said I will be at the venue in 3 minutes when that wasn't true I was going to be late and possible not allowed to write at a normal time. I was so upset I raised my voice, but of course didn't swear or call him any names. I was just audibly pissed. He was very chilled about the fact that he forgot to hire transport even though I told him about the whole thing. I acknowledge that I was a bit rude. I wrote the exam due to the kindness of a lecturer that teaches me. I apologized to my uncle when he called me after the exam. He said that he did felt a disrespected and offended , I assume by my tone and he told my aunt. He mentioned that the another reason that he was upset was because I called the transport guy before I called him. Again at that time I didnt know he didn't order transport. He was also angry that after the exam a friend took me to a local shop for me to buy stuff, instead of the transport guy when he payed for the transport. After the exam I was not sure if the transport guy was going to come as it was not ordered for the day, so I went with my friend. 

He and my aunt have done alot for me and it is only through their support that I was able to go to college. 

I am very grateful. But I just felt a bit upset that he didn't make sure I get to my exam venue in time knowing there is no transport system In the area we live in."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

One of the neighbors on our block has recently decided to relocated her potted plants from the front of her house to the sidewalk. Not the portion of her lawn right before the sidewalk, but right in the middle of it. Numerous times I had to either walk to the opposite sidewalk or pull on my dogs to make sure they don’t water them. No doubt others have also been inconvenienced. I’m not sure about the reason why, but I have asked her respectfully if she could move them at least back onto the edge of her yard so that they don’t block the way. She didn’t take it well and finished our conversation in a passive agressive manner. I normally make sure when taking my dogs out for a walk to not let them pee on whatever may be laying on people’s lawn and move something over if it happens to be blocking the sidewalk, but her attitude for inconveniencing others with something that would take two seconds to fix just got to me. Since then, whenever I happen to be heading down the block that way, I just simply stop holding my dogs back and have them go at it. Eventually she came out and started callling me an asshole and that she’ll report me if I continue. I’ve talked with other neighbors who happen to have potted plants and some of them agree that I’m in the wrong for ruining someone’s hobby and hard work instead of just continuing to walk around it even if they shouldn’t be on the sidewalk.

Her parents don't know she smokes so, when she is with her parents she doesn't smoke (up to 2 full weeks last holiday). Also when we are at my parents she doesn't smoke for several days because she is embarrassed to smoke in front of them. When I told my parents that she does smoke she was slightly mad at me.

She’s 26 not working or in school and smokes a lot of weed. She used to be an addict and went to read for heroin.I hang out with her sometimes. She lives a mile from my apartment. She offers to pick me up because I've been rear-ended before and have a lot of fear driving. I get panic attacks sometimes driving because the accident was pretty bad.  I uber to her place half the time. Sometimes I drive myself.


She sometimes asks to drive around, and I thought she enjoyed it so I would ask to go driving with her too sometimes. She occasionally smokes weed and drives but doesn't like if I comment negatively on it. I usually probably once a week give her 12-15 dollars in gas money. Recently I commented negatively on her smoking habits. A couple of days later, she texted me about how I walk all over her with the gas money situation. She says I don't offer every time she gives a ride and that's disrespectful.  She says she won't handle someone being entitled.

I said I give like 15 dollars every couple times and she said it's not fair because it's ”always my idea to go driving” in between leases I let this girl stay at my apartment for ten days and I live in a small studio. I also helped her pack and move and took stuff to goodwill. I also bring weed or chip in for plant every time we hang out. I'm a 21-year-old college student for reference

bx15q6	2019-06-05 10:45:43		AITA for offering to provide my(24F) brother(15M) with alcohol when he's older?	"My brother is 9 years younger than me, and 12 years younger than our older sister. He was basically raised as an only child and has waaay more freedom and material things than we did (which is great). However, he is completely sheltered.

My sister started using drugs around the age of 16, and she used to take me out and party with me when I was 15/16 (the drinking age is 18). She ended up doing two stints in rehab nd is sober now, but I turned out pretty okay. I've never been arrested and my relationship with drugs was harmless and recreational, and now I smoke the occasional (legal) joint. I like to drink a lot, but that's like every few weeks.

The drug and alcohol culture in my country, and in my middle-class neighbourhood, would horrify you. When I go out with my friends I run into kids a year or two older than my brother, coked out of their mind or drunk and crying in a parking lot at 10pm. These kids aren't being looked after and I've had to herd a few minors into ubers, or call their parents. Besides the obvious concern of them being arrested, these kids could be abducted or worse. I know what it's like to lie to your parents about your whereabouts and realise, in hindsight, if something happened to you they wouldn't have known where to start looking.

My brother and his friends are still gaming a lot and doing wholesome mall-crawls, but I know that they are talking about getting ""lit"" and wanting to experiment with alcohol. It is honestly inevitable that they will start smoking weed (it is legal for adults) as I've seen people from his school blazing in the park near our house. My brother doesn't have anyone looking out for him or telling him the ins and outs of experimenting, so I tried to have an open-door policy with him and told him that he can call me, for anything, if he needs to. The conversation of alcohol came up and I said something like, ""I would rather you smuggle some beers upstairs with your friends than try your luck at bars and get shitfaced with no way home. If that means you have to ask me to spot you some beers, I'll consider it."" So I'm not offering to sponsor a kegger or house party, but I really don't want him to have to figure this shit out alone or chug tequila in an empty park at 2am.

I mentioned it to our mom and she said she was happy I was treating him like a sibling and not like my child (which happens a lot). The age gap, and the fact that I 'know better' than to give alcohol to a minor is what is making me feel like an asshole, but, really, it isn't impossible for kids to get alcohol in my country. He also might benefit from a stricter upbringing where alcohol is prohibited. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0
bx150m	2019-06-05 10:42:59	fruittellaman	"AITA for ""policing"" my housemates' sex life?"	"I'm gonna start by acknowledging what a bizarre situation I'm in. Welcome, Reddit, to the Kafkaesque hellscape my life has become. 

A couple of months ago I [21M] had an absolute nightmare with my landlord/living situation which basically resulted in me becoming homeless over night. I ended up staying in a hotel for two days before a friend [27M] offered to lease me the spare room in his house while I tried to sort something else. I was pretty blown away by his kindness, as we're not *that* close, just in the same friendship group. Gratefully, I signed a six month lease and moved in. 

Here's the thing: this guy and his wife's [24F] sexlife is honestly kinda fucking bonkers. For a start they do the DD/lg thing full time at home, which I'm incredibly uncomfortable with. Like she fully dresses like a toddler and sucks a dummy and plays with baby toys and stuff when they're both home. No offence if you're into that, but it fucking skeeves me out. Won't get into it, but I have a lot of past trauma that makes that stuff make my skin crawl. Further they have sex *all the time* and *everywhere*. I get home from work and they're just banging on the couch with the living room door wide open, I go to get a glass of water and they're fucking on the kitchen table, I go for a piss and they're shagging in the shower without the door locked. She's even made comments that allude to them doing it on my bed while I'm not there. It's reached a point where I'm barely leaving my room for fear of walking in on them.

A week or so ago, I asked if they wouldn't mind dialling it back a little bit with the sex and kink related stuff. I've essentially been told that I'm under their roof and this is how they live so I have to deal with it. Also got a strip torn off of me for kinkshaming and was told I have no right to police their sex life. They also complained of having heard my boyfriend [20M] and I when he's been over, so we're even on me walking in on them. I'm really not trying to police anyone's sexuality here but I'm seriously stressed with the situation. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My sister told me she had these issues as she doesn't look anything like some Instagram models she follows. So i asked her ""Why do you want to look like them?"" and she couldn't give me a straight answer.

I already knew the answer. I told her ""You want to look like them because A) they get externally validated by millions of people and B) looking that good means you can hook up with more people"". She didn't dispute what i said so I took it further and just flat out said ""Look, these body image issues you are having are dumb. Why do you give a fuck about random people's opinions of you who you don't even know? and even if you did hook up more, casual hook ups are not fulfilling and will not validate you. Your issues are dumb""

She started crying and called me asshole. I can't fathim why her and so many others have these issues. Is people's self esteem these days so low that they need strangers on instagram to justify their existence?  lol.

bx136q	2019-06-05 10:35:46		AITA for calling out a transgender during an intramural basketball game?	"Last night was the finals for my university’s co-ed basketball intramural game. The rules of intramural co-ed basketball is to have at least two girls on the courts at all time. Well here’s where it gets iffy. A transgender (male to female) starts on the other team. For reference, she’s 6-4 while our tallest girl is 5-4. Last fall, I played pickup ball with her (back when she was a man) at the school’s gym, and (then) he was one of the better players there, especially when it came to rebounds.

Needless to say, we got destroyed in the post cause none of our girls could defend nor grab a single rebound over the transgender. They kept feeding her in the post where she played bully ball over our smaller girls. Worst part is that the transgender kept trash talking, saying shit like “you can’t guard me”, “you too little”, flexing, and kept whining the refs. Needless to say, my whole team and I were pretty heated since we didn’t think she should’ve been able to play as a girl in the first place.

Unsurprisingly, we were losing by a lot, and one of my friends on the other team started talking smack saying “man we beating yo ass” and whatnot. In the heat of the moment, I talked back and told him that “we’d be winning if we had 4 dudes playing too”. He laughed it off but the referees heard this and gave me a technical foul, saying that it’s not appropriate and unsportsmanlike. After the game when we shook hands in a line, the transgender told me “stop crying and being a little bitch”. I didn’t say anything back as I decided it wasn’t worth it, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to throw hands right there.

I know it’s not the most politically correct thing to say but I truly feel that abusing that loophole in the rules truly killed the integrity of the game, so AITA for calling the opposing team’s transgender out during our intramural game?"		1	0

bx112q	2019-06-05 10:27:40	notmypeople	AITA for not being friendlier or engaging more with my boyfriend's friends?	"Backstory: My boyfriend, Jason, and I, Ben, have dated for 3 years. I tend to be quiet and introverted, I am naturally calm, quiet, and shy. Also, because I'm naturally quiet and I know I am odd in social situations, I much prefer quiet environments and being in small groups. My boyfriend has been okay with this.

Present: Harry, Jason's friend, works at a popular and noisy dance club near where my boyfriend and I live. Three weeks ago, he invited Jason to a work party. Jason knows I don't do well in loud environments, but he likes us going out as a couple, so I went with him.  I sat, met his friends, shook hands, smiled, and observed. Throughout the night, Jason, Harry, and Harry's friends got drunk and became rambunctious: they were bumping into people, knocking over drinks, and speaking harshly of others. I did my best to stick to my norm: sat back, observed, smiled as best I could manage, and engaged when I was addressed, but I didn't actively go out of my way to engage with anyone because I did find the scene and the people not to my liking.

When we got home, my boyfriend wasn't cheery anymore. I asked if something was wrong. He basically yelled, ""I am so tired of you being an asshole to people! Why can't you just talk to them! Why can't you be friendlier and engage them? I am so tired of telling everyone that you're just quiet when they ask me why you're being an asshole and explaining to people that 'Oh, Ben isn't bored. He's just quiet.' I am getting tired of this and tired of defending you! Why can't you just be nicer to people?! Would it have killed you to talk to Cathy or Veronica more? You also ignored Harry all night! What's your problem?"" I didn't know what to say, so I just apologized and went to bed.

So, am I the asshole here? I admittedly wasn't the friendliest to any of the people because I did find them to be obnoxious in addition to my dislike of the scene, but I feel I truly did my best to smile, nod, and look happy. Jason and I both knew I wasn't going to a scene I was comfortable with, and he knows I'm naturally quiet around people I'm unfamiliar with, but I don't think I was rude to anyone by being my typical quiet self. So am I the ass hole here? Should I have put in more effort to be loud and be part of the group? Should I have put my personal biases/preferences aside for Jason and his friends? I feel bad that my being there embarrassed Jason, but should I?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

So, to start off, my English is not my native language, so there might be some mistakes. Soo, bear with me.

Recently, my sister and I (both 18) gratuated high school, both of us being rewarded for our hardwork that we've put in these four years of school.

But, my sister felt that our parents didn't care as much for our results as others, and she's been mad with them ever since, ignoring them and only talking to them when needed ( and even then, she talks in a very rude tone ).

My parents don't know what to do, so, I ve tried to reason with her, and tell her ""Look, they made a mistake and they know it. You should drop the act"" 
She wouldn't listen
So I added ""They are still our parents and compared to others, they support us greatly from a financial standpoint, although they can't really aford it. For example, we are going to attend college next year, and who's gonna support our gigantic expenses? They are.""

At this point, she starts crying heavily and runs into the next bedroom.

I felt like an asshole and can't get this out of my head. I wanted to use that argument as a wake up call, but all I did is put salt to injury.

bx0yvt	2019-06-05 10:19:00	DayOldBaguette	AITA for confronting my friend for being overly fussy?	"I got into an argument two months ago with a friend of mine (let’s call her Sarah) who I haven’t talked with since. At this point I don’t think the friendship is salvageable unless I essentially beg her for forgiveness. However, I don’t want to do that because I don’t think I’m in the wrong here.

Little bit of context first: I am very bad at confrontation and arguing in person, whenever I’m put in a spot where I have to defend my point of view I always fail at coming up with good arguments and only think of good comebacks after-the-fact. I also use the wrong word to describe what I’m saying a lot of the time. My friends and family eventually get used to this though and learn to not focus on every word. 

But recently Sarah started doing this thing where while I was explaining something or joking around, she would correct me and tell me off for not remembering a detail or using the wrong word. I found this annoying because I’d feel like she didn’t listen to anything I said and instead focused on one single mistake. This began to annoy me over time and I grew fed up with it (as if the fact that while talking to Sarah I always had to tread lightly out of fear of saying something that could be interpreted the wrong way wasn’t enough, now i had to watch my words carefully so that she would listen to me) so I confronted her about it peacefully. She told me she got it from me (which isn’t really an excuse in my opinion), we talked for a bit about it, and I thought the issue had been resolved. 
As it turns out, it wasn’t. She continued to do this, and overtime I built up frustration which ended with me raising my voice and telling her to cut this shit out, to which she responded with “when are you going to stop being so rude to me?” to which I said: “when you stop correcting me on things that don’t matter!”. And those were the last words we said to each other.
Am I the asshole in this scenario? I’m so sick of being the one to have to beg for forgiveness whenever we get in a fight, but if I’m in the wrong I at least want to apologize (just for the sake of not having this on my conscience)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm more on the private side, and can be a bit prudish. I'm a male in my 30s who works for my mother, in our family business. I get triggered when my mother over shares.

My mother has been in and out of many relationships. She is just about to get married for the third time. 

She once brought my sister and I to an LGBT Cabaret, where she fingered a papaya and dedicated it to her girlfriend. I only mention this to give you an idea of why I'm so sensitive to her oversharing. That's one of the worst stories, but it gets the point across. I was 14 or something at the time.

I have problems with intimacy and expressing it. I've had two girlfriends in my life. 

Anyway, she was telling me a story about all these people who we're in love with her or something, and I was listening and trying to be supportive, but then she referred to one of her friends as an ex friends with benefits. 
I felt she had crossed the line, and she didn't need to get so explicit.

 Am I just throwing a temper tantrum? Am I a pathetic excuse for 30 year old male? This is all very stressful, because at least for now she is still somewhat my boss, and I find it makes work very unpleasant when we get in these arguments.

Me: ""I'm not your friend. Please, don't brag about your sex life with me. Taylor your words for your son. Yeesh""

HER: ""I am going to breath before I respond to your comment.  

But, I will say this.  We were two adults having a conversation.   I was not bragging.   It's hardly anything worth bragging about.  It's where you went in your own head.

bx0saj	2019-06-05 09:53:23	rslash729	AITA for not inviting my friend to my bday party when he forgot to wish me happy birthday?	"I dont have many friends but i am very happy with the ones i have now and on friday im having a birthday party and it will be me and 2 other friends and this one friend now let me explain.

This one friend and i only met in september last year and we were getting along just fine, as the months went by he started becoming someone else and now all he talks about is drugs (nothing else) and he nevrt has anything intresting to say.

All my friends wished me happy birthday at midnight tonight and this one friend hasnt sent me anything at all.

I have already been thinking if i should invite him or not and now since ive not heard a single word from him (not even at school) i sent him a message asking if he remembered what today is and anything happening and he just said no. Then someone on a group chat wished me a happy birthday and i responded in saying thank you and then he sent me a message wishing me happy birthday after. Here ill list all the things ive done for him

Giving him free netflix, spotify and prime subscription, gave him a extended mouse pad bought him a game, invited him to countless lunches and dinner (and i paid but not for all of them) and he has invited me over to his house and im graceful for it and always said thank you. Everytime he came over he never said anything.

After this i told him that on saturday im not inviting him this is the text i sent ""hey man after some thinking i decided not to invite you yo my party on saturday because i feel you aren't trying hard enough in this friendship and never thank me for any of the things i give you and to be honest im very tired of this and to top it all up you never wished me a happy birthday"" his response was ""fuck you, you were a bad friend anyway and a total piece of shit, it was nice to use you for all the free shit"" and he blocked me. 

Ive had many of what i tought were good friends but it turns out to be he was just using me like 2 other people in my past but its a shitty feeling

Fyi the spotify, netflix and prime are registered under my perents account (i cant offord to pay all of that with no job) and i am 16 today so ye all of this happend 1 hour ago."	Asshole	0	0

they are flying from the Netherlands. 
we have been together for 2 years but my family do not have the money to get to me so this is the actual first time they will be meeting, they have only facetimed. 
here is a photo of a similar dress, just imagine its slightly shorter and has no glitter.

she refused to change into a more formal dress and has been telling me that I'm stressing to much. I got angry at her telling me that, so I decided that I did not want her to wear it so i hid it.

My husband and I(f) got married two years ago. When we did I did not change my name to his. 

I have always loved my last name and growing up I never thought I would change it/take someone else's name.  When I had fake weddings as a kid my friend would always take my name (useless info).

Anyway it's not fair that I have to take his name and for the same reason I would never ask him to take mine.

So when we have kids would we be the bumhole if their parents have separate names?
If we don't change our names I will not let our children to have a different last name then me. Though I haven't told him this yet. 

We have also talked about creating a new last name so our family can share one that we both feel good about. Would we be the bumhole to his parents/family in that case?

At any point here AITA?

"My (24f) mom (47f) had my little brother (18m) with my deceased step father. He was a wonderful man with a controlling and emotionally taxing and cruel sister and mother. They were always mean to my mom but when he passed away 6 years ago they turned nasty. Held their own funeral without inviting any of us, spread weird cruel rumours about my grieving mother around to the rest of the family and were just in general awful people. 

Mom makes good money and had helped my deceased stepfathers mother in paying for her house and has always made sure my little brother has had a good relationship with them as they are the last connection he has with our dad. Other than that we have cut them out completely. 

My brother asks me question about why I don't want to see his Grandma and all that and I usually bounce around it. I told my mom I wanted to tell him the truth about that family. And she says she doesn't want me to because she doesn't want their relationship to be ruined.   I'm not going to try and manipulate him to feel a certain way I just think he should know the truth. I think it's important, they've lied to him in the past about weird things. And I just think he should know.

bx0iix	2019-06-05 09:12:11		WIBTA If I threaten to call the police on my uncle for controlling my grandmother?	"We come from a stupid, conservative traditional Indian culture where you have to respect your family no matter what. My siblings and I are first-generation Canadians, so you'll see why I'm so pissed off about this backwards culture. My grandma is being freaking abused, emotionally, by her own son. 

Here's what he's done lately:

•Told my grandmother if she gets her own cellphone, he's going to smash it into pieces.

•Illegally records her phone-calls to our house from the home phone, but doesn't let her get her own. 
 
 And that's nothing compared to what he's done to other members of my family - things he'd be in jail for years for doing. My parents tell me to shut up about it because he has four kids, and they don't want to jeopardize their lives. 

I can't even call my own grandmother. I never get to see her, maybe once a week. He's robbing my brothers and I of seeing our grandmother, because he has problems with my parents that have led to our families cutting each other off. My grandmother is scared of her own son, yet continues to live with him because of pathetic Indian traditions that the mother is supposed to live in her son's house - and my mom is her daughter. She thinks she'll bring shame to our family by living with us.

 I'm sorry for the anger behind this post. All I can think of is my grandmother living in fear for years, her own grandchildren she lives with don't respect her, and she never gets to visit us or she's too afraid to leave the house because he interrogates her. I want to spend time with my grandmother before she's gone. 

Consequences:

•Parents will probably throw me out or hate me for the rest of my life, for doing this (I love my parents but they're very traditional
•I'm sticking my nose where it doesn't belong apparently

bx0i6j	2019-06-05 09:10:42	throwaway769428	WIBTA if I told my family they need to get their shit together?	"Throwaway because details; TLDR at the bottom.

I’m staying at my family’s place for a few weeks - uni has just finished for summer and I’ve made some extra-curricular commitments in the area so it’s easier to stay here. Also, I haven’t had much time to see everyone recently due to coursework, so initially the arrangement suited all parties. But now it doesn’t suit me. 

My family have a bunch of cats and a dog. I’m allergic, but usually I just take antihistamines and I’m absolutely fine. The issue is the sheer volume of hair - it’s everywhere. Clothes, towels, bedsheets, everywhere. 

The biggest issue is cleanliness. The house used to be cleaned to a decent standard, but now the house is filthy. I attempted to clean a room at the weekend and it took me 8 hours to get halfway through. I don’t understand how they can live like this, and the antihistamines aren’t enough anymore. One family member has a rash all over their body and was told by the doctor it’s due to dust mites. 

They are the most disorganised people I’ve ever met. For instance, the little one needs to get to school in the morning, and they ask me late the night before if I can walk her there because they have no other option. I don’t know what the hell they do when I’m not there. The final straw came today when, halfway to school, the little one suddenly remembered she had gym class and nobody had packed her kit. 

I could go on and on, but the question I have is this: WIBTA if I tell my family I’m going to stay at a friend’s/other family member’s place because they’re unclean, disorganised, and they need to get their shit together? I feel like I need to tell them - I care about them and want to see them sort themselves out, but I don’t know what the protocol is here. I feel like I’d be an asshole for basically telling them their house is dirty, but I think it needs to be said. 


TLDR: family’s house is dirty and they’re extremely disorganised. WIBTA for calling them out and staying at a friend’s?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bx0hl2	2019-06-05 09:08:12		WIBTA if I told my dad that he's a lazy, irresponsible hypocrite for wanting to quit school for the second time?	"So before I begin I need to describe my father (48 years old) to you.

He is extremely strict with me and my education and is always telling me that I need it if I want a good life. Because we live in Germany and the education here is basically free, EVERYONE has a chance to become anything they want.

My dad has never known what profession he wants to do. First he was in veterinary school and he quit, then he became a priest (studied theology), then we moved to the U.S. and basically got scammed by the church, then he didn't want to be a priest anymore, then he was a truck driver, then he wanted to start his own truck company, then he threw that idea away and quit his job, then he was unemployed for 2 years for absolutely no reason, and then he decided to study management FOR WHICH HE IS BEING PAID FOR. All my life we've been moving to different countries and cities just because my dad can't figure out what he wants to do in his life. He's done a very large variety of things and he always quit.

My dad is getting paid to get an education because thats how it goes here in Germany. And if you think about it, that's fucking amazing.

The problem is: He is skipping school at the moment. A lot. He started school in March and he's not taking it seriously at all. He has failed most of his tests because he didn't study at all, he goes 3-4 hours later than he should or he just doesn't go at all.  He goes to the doctor and pretends that he's sick. And what does he do if he's not going to school you ask?

He's at home. Sleeping. Scrolling through Facebook. Eating a bunch of food. Mostly scrolling through Facebook though. He just doesn't do ANYTHING. And then he says that school is just so hard and so much work and he feels ""imprisoned"" there. Eventhough he hasn't done absolutely anything that required hard work.  And to be completely honest with you, I think he's just very very lazy.

He always TALKS about how he loooves Germans because they are always nice and strict with their schedules and he loves planning and being organized and cleaning the house regularly and having many hobbies. But he doesn't do any of that.

And now he wants to quit school too.

I hate how ungrateful he is because this is really his absolute last chance. He went through so much just to get the spot in that school and we are in fact living off of the money he earns JUST by attending. He is so hypocritical and always tells me that school is so easy and ""why can't you just have A's everywhere, it's easy: study"" but he hasn't even picked up a book in the past few months.

I really really want to tell him but even thinking like this makes me feel like an asshole because it's my DAD. My Mum is also not doing anything about this. She has completely given up on my Dad. Idk if I'm making sense right now"	Not enough info	1	0

I (28F) live at home with my family and come from a traditional background. Typically, females don’t move out till they are married and boys usually stay home and look after the family. So now you know why I still live at home. But I don’t want this part to be the focus, it is what it is. It’s the next part I need help with 😭

I can’t stand inconsiderate people, particularly when it comes to hygiene. If I use the loo or shower, I want to find it they way I leave it - CLEAN. 

My siblings 25M, 19M, 26F are all VILE. They never clean up after themselves and are lazy af. My mum has gone mental over them for nearly all of her life. The youngest has no concept. Literally NO CONCEPT. Of cleaning, how to clean, what clean is. I mean it baffles me to my very core how someone can be so oblivious. The older brother works away from home and even on weekends when he visits he comes home and acts like this is his ffff kingdom, I will do as I please and SHIT EVERYWHERE. 

I am the only one who no one has ever complained when it comes to my stuff lying around, leaving a mess behind myself, being smelly, being dirty. I mean for god’s sake. Wtaf.

I know I can’t move out just yet. I am hoping to soon as I recently got married and things are moving in that direction... but without going in to unnecessary details it’s not happening immediately so I need to deal with it. I realise I can’t fix them. So I need to start with the change in myself. How do I stop getting so MAD. I mean I am an actual psycho when it comes to how pissed off I get having to deal with this shit every single day. I just think how can it be fair to be so inconsiderate to people around you? I just want to know how to be able to cope. 

For example, walk in to the shower, crappy mess hair etc all over. How do you not start screaming at the person to clean up. How do I not get so angry? I mean tbh this just happened now. I told my brother (you ger one) what he expects me to do? Does he enjoy me shouting? I don’t. I’m like shower somewhere else if it is so difficult to clean up after yourself. He thinks I am being unreasonable. He apologises but what’s the point. It’s the same the next day! I don’t even know if my post is making sense! 😭😭😭 

I need help. I mean AITA? And if you think I am. What should I do? I know some will tell me to probably hang in there till I can leave.... 🔪😭"		1	0
bx0bvb	2019-06-05 08:42:18		AITA for cutting ties with a long time friend	"So I’m friends with this guy, let’s call him V for about 10 years now and one of my closest friends. 
About a year ago I met this girl M, we were just chatting a bit for a few months. 
Beginning of this year we started hanging out more, facetiming for 1-2hours few times a week and I started to like her. 
One night she texted me to come over, I did and once I was there she just told me it was a joke and should leave again. 
I told her if shes not interested it’s fine but no further actions like this in the future please. 
About 1 month lather it was my 22. birthday and that’s where V comes in. 
(They already knew each other a bit from me taking her with me when we were hanging out in our group.) 
So at my birthday M was again pretty clingy and I talked to her when i showed her a room she could sleep what’s the meaning behind this and she just said something like she’s just not looking for a relationship and why can’t Guys just be friends with girls (well I can but her behavior was just not what I’m used to in a friendship) 
So I thought whatever and accepted it. 

Later that night I was thinking where is V and searched him. Of course I found him sleeping next to her. I was kinda bummed because he knew I was interested in her but thought not more out of it. 

1 month past still occasionally chatting with M but did not hear much from V. 
When I met him at a birthdayparty of a friend and talked to him I asked if he met up with M since then. He said no why should he. 
Later I heard form a friend that they are doing a lot together lately but are just good friends. 
So I wrote V that I’m disappointed he lied to me and met with M behind my back without talking to me, he wanted to talk but I didn’t feel like it. 

What brings us to yesterday when I got a text message from V telling me he fell in love with M and they are a couple now and that he wants to talk to me about it because the friendship is him important. I wished them good luck and told him I don’t want to talk about it and that I’m not feel like being friend with him anymore. 

The problem is this will pretty much divide our group of friends and I’m feeling a bit guilty for it.

So AITA for cutting ties with him and not wanting to hear his explanation with the predestination of the falling apart of our group of friends?"		1	0

A bit of background info, I'm a gay 26 y/o. I was an active tumblr user for many years and made many many friends on there. One of these friends i made as a 38 y/o gay man (we will call him ""K"". We were very much into each other, exactly each others types but we could never really meet because we lived about 3-4 hours away from each other. We pretty much settled on just being really good flirty friends that send nudes, pretty harmless.

Fast forward 3 years, still very good online friends with K, i got offered a very good job in a city thats very close to where K lives. I told K that i was going to be moving there and he was ecstatic, as was I. We pretty much set up a first ever meeting together as soon as i got there. Nothing sexual, just a coffee and a hug. We both really enjoyed each others company and got on just as well as we did online. The innocent flirting continued.

Fast forward another month, i lacked friends down here but thankfully K introduced me to a lot of his friends which i soon became a close part of. He introduced me to this other gay man, (40 y/o, let's call him ""R""). R was a very good looking man, muscled, masculine, could easily be a model. I became pretty good friends with him too.

K and R became a couple very shortly after that. I was super happy for them, they'd often invite my round for dinners and included me in their outings. I felt very loved. R does something in aviation, not really sure, but i know he sometimes goes away for 3 months at a time.

One night, K was texting me and things got very flirty and very sexual. This wasn't strange to me as we were like this back on tumblr but it stopped when he got together with R. K eventually asked me to come round to his and have some fun, i asked if R would be ok with it, he said that they have an open relationship due to his work. So i was happy to jump at the chance to finally have fun with this crush i've had for years.

Within the 2 months of R being away, we had fun with each other most nights. It was always very chill, relaxed and fun. Never any stress.

I still talked to R by text since we both watch certain TV shows and we like to discuss them. I ***stupidly*** said that me and K were watching it one night. R asked me what date and what time, i told him and R mentioned that K said he was staying with his family that weekend. This is where my heart sank. R directly asked if me and K have slept together, i told him he really needs to speak to K about this. R was getting really upset and i was trying to calm him down but felt really out of place, he told me that K asked R if they could open their relationship specifically for me. R said no as he wants a monogamous relationship. I told him he really needs to speak to K.

Its been 48 hours, i've not heard from either of them. I've tried texting K but he hasn't even looked at my messages. Am i the asshole here? I feel so extremely really bad about the whole situation."	Not the A-hole	0	0

For years We constantly fought and sometimes it got physical with neighbors threatening to call the cops. We finally got to a somewhat okay place but instead of being strict like she used to, she became completely laid back and I lost control of my entire life and went nuts. She was never there for me emotionally or anything and didn’t care and would never tell me where she was going or when she was leaving, sometimes leaving me and my sister alone for hours babysitting my little brother, or when she wouldn’t have my brother she would leave me alone for days no clue where she was. But I did everything for her from taking care of my 5 year old brother to constantly cleaning the house and listening to her cry.

I had finally decided I had enough when I 15 didn’t even have a permit and had to drive across town to a bar to pick her wasted ass up and she refused to get in the car followed by blocking me from her location and yelling nasty things at me. I packed my bags that night  and moved in with my aunt who now puts much more of a schedule into my life, while my mom is still posting sob stories on fb about how horrible of a daughter I am and cropping me out of pictures.She never had anything nice to say to me so I took it upon myself to block her and I avoid her at family events and didn’t invite her to my 16th birthday recently.

bx06ls	2019-06-05 08:18:17	Throwaway124643211	AITA for stopping my partner half way through sex and walking out?	"Hello. I’m currently involved in a sexual relationship with a friend of mine. We’re never going to end up together for many, many reasons (all of which involve our circumstances, not our compatibility) but we’re great friends with a brilliant connection and the sex is fantastic.

We don’t get to see each other very often, maybe once every few months. We’re currently both attending a conference away from our respective hometowns. Work is paying so separate rooms. 

So, we were having sex in his hotel room last night. It was awesome. I came three times. Now, like many women, my orgasm can be a complicated thing. Sometimes I can’t cum at all (usually when drunk or very tired), sometimes I have one big orgasm, sometimes multiple smaller ones. I can cum from penetration alone, which I know is unusual. I know my body pretty well, I know when it’s not going to happen, and I can have a great time regardless. 

So, I cum three times. He keeps trying. I tell him, baby I can’t cum again. He says yes you can. I said no, I can’t. He keeps trying, I’m moving his hand away sometimes but also not always, enjoying the sensations even if I can’t cum again. But he keeps insisting I can. At this point I have said very clearly several times, I cannot cum. And he is telling me repeatedly yes I can. I get fucked off. I felt disrespected and like he was telling me he knew more about me than I did. 

So I pushed him off and got dressed. I told him I didn’t want this to ruin our week together, but I was leaving for the night and he owed me an apology. He refused to apologize, said I wasn’t clear enough and that he’d taken “I can’t cum again” as a challenge. He also snapped that no woman had ever said that to him before.

Side note, he’s a good looking dude and he’s had a lot of casual sex. Pushing three figures. I suspect that like most men, he’s been lied to A LOT by women about sex and orgasms. He seems to think that orgasm from penetration alone and multiple orgasms are the norm, and it’s definitely not.

We were always doubles partners at local tournaments but we never got the best results. One day I had to go home earlier than usual so my friend teamed up with someone else and ended up winning. Since he's been getting better results, it's kind of understandable why he would do this but even so, I've been feeling down ever since he told me he was ditching me as a doubles partner. AITA?

bx062x	2019-06-05 08:16:00	hushnowkeepitdown	AITA for distancing myself from two of my friends after they started dating?	"For context, the three of us are college students. Let's call them Alex and Jesse.

So, a few months ago, two of my friends started dating. Prior to this, we typically hung out as a trio, though we would occasionally have a few other people with us. Now, though, I find it really hard to enjoy myself when I'm with just the two of them. Alex and Jesse are both very close friends of mine, and yet after they started dating, it feels like our whole friend dynamic has changed. In other words, I feel like the biggest third wheel to ever third wheel whenever I'm around them.

Of course, I'm happy for them. The relationship seems to be going really well, and they're both genuinely in love with each other. That's all really great for them, but...I just feel really out of place. Alex and Jesse talk very openly about their relationship around me (everything from sex, to cute date moments, showing me pictures of themselves/each other, etc), they kiss a lot around me,  and sometimes have full conversations with each other even when I'm there. It just feels like I...shouldn't be there.

Hanging out with either of them one-on-one isn't much better. Alex never stops talking about Jesse, and vice versa. They'll even vent their frustrations about their relationship to me, which puts me in an awkward position given I'm friends with both of them. I understand it's not really anyone's fault; they're in that ""new relationship"" phase where all they see is each other. I've 100% been there before. But I just don't feel comfortable hanging out with them, at least not the way I did before. I don't WANT to be distant-I wasn't even entirely aware of it at first-but now, being around them is just really exhausting for me.

I do have other friends, and I've been hanging out with them a lot more lately. However, this has sparked a...weird reaction from Alex and Jesse. They're suddenly VERY persistent when asking me to do stuff, to the point that they'll argue with me when I say no. And yet, their behavior is otherwise the same; for instance, when we were studying for exams together, Jesse was in Alex's lap the whole time, barely focusing on the actual studying. They would goof off with each other a lot, and it just made me feel uncomfortable and left out (not to mention they'd stop and kiss every five minutes).

With the school year coming to an end (and the three of us about to return to our respective home states), I'm honestly not sure if saying something is the best idea right now. I have a lot of pressure on me academically, and that's where my focus is right now.

bx05sa	2019-06-05 08:14:50	Tryn2bagoodsis	AITA for not giving my desperate family member a way to earn an income?	"So, a bit of a backstory: 

My family member is a digital addict. Now, it might seem like a joke to all the gamers on here, but I can assure you if you have been through the hell that my family had to go through a year or two ago you will know its no laughing matter. 

Anyway, he returned from rehab and showed some improvement, got a job, was more mature, and we thought that things were looking up. It is still going well, he kept his job, shows up for work and is all round more responsible, however, he has made a stupid mistake which makes me fear that history might repeat itself. 

He doesn't get a large salary, but since his parents sponsor his insurance, bought him a car and sponsors the roof over his head his salary should be able to completely cover his expenses and then some. 

However, he was saving up to buy a new gaming console (red flag) (we got rid of the one he had while at rehab as it was the bane of his addiction- we sold it to recoup some of the money he stole to fund said addiction) which obviously concerned us, but since its his money and not a controlled substance we can't do much to stop him. Turns out the saving didn't go as planned, so he blew his entire salary on the gaming console and games. Guys, its the 5th of the month, 20 days till payday and he pretty much has nothing. No money for proper food, no fuel in his car to get to work, nothing. 

When he called me last night in tears (as his parents refused to help) and told me about the console, I told him he must then sell the console and games for money to survive the month. He told he it isn't even an option. 

Before I learnt of his financial crisis (and the reason behind it) I said that he can work for my company for a day over a weekend and baby sit for extra money. However, I now want to take those options away as I really believe its best for him (and the family) that he truly learns the hard way how stupid and selfish this decision was. 

Now, before you blame me for leaving this family member in the cold- he has a roof over his head that gets paid for by his parents, he doesn't stay far from work so he can walk or borrow a bike, and I'm sure that he will have something to eat - of not, I will buy him a bag of potatoes to survive on. 

He tells me I'm being unfair and coldhearted for promising to assist him (by giving him work) and then changing my mind. I told him I will assist the moment he sells the console. He tells me its not an option. 

I hate seeing him struggle, but I really believe that he must learn the hard way (since the easy way didn't work).

bx04qs	2019-06-05 08:10:04	Blukoi	WIBTA if I change my name?	"I'm 27, male, and half filipino & half white. My dad is white, so I have a white last name. My middle name was one of my mother's grandfather's, so it is Filipino but it's from a time when the Philippines was basically under control of Christianity, e.g. my middle name is the biblical Alexander and to 99% of people you would never guess that it's Filipino; I didn't even know I was named after my great grandfather until a few years ago.

I've always been very proud of being Filipino but I don't quite look Filipino, I don't speak tagalog, and for all intents and purposes I don't feel like I have a Filipino name. It's something that's bothered me basically my whole life. I want to be a proud Filipino and I try to act like I am but for the aforementioned reasons I feel like a fraud.

Recently my dad changed his name. He always went by his middle name, such that I often forgot that he had a different first name. Around 5 years ago he legally changed his name to the one that he was known by and the one he liked to be called, and I realized that I could do the same thing, to change my middle name to more adequately reflect my Filipino heritage and take my mother's maiden name as my middle name.

I brought up the idea to my father and he supported me. My middle name is really of no consequence to him and he understands my feelings and reasons for wanting to do it. I brought it up to my mother once a few years ago and although she seemed to understand she took a moment to explain that my name was her grandfather's and technically Filipino, but in the end she said that she understood, if a little dejectedly. I didn't even bring it up to her parents because I know that they wouldn't completely understand.

I don't want to hurt my mom. I don't want to hurt my grandparents. I understand that my name is my great-grandfather's, but it doesn't feel like it's mine. I want to change my name, feel more comfortable with who I am, and honor & feel more a part of the family that I know and love. Maybe it won't do that, maybe I won't feel more Filipino, but maybe I will.

WIBTA?

Edit: To clarify, I would want to keep my first and last name (which is also my father's last name), but replace my middle name with my mother's maiden name."	Not enough info	0	0

A bit of background: my wife and I are super happily married for 3 years now. We rarely have any arguments and when we do argue, we typically forget what it was about a couple of weeks later.

So when I was at work today, I got a DM from my best friend, let's call him Alex(M) who I have known since I was a baby. We don't talk often but we're always there for each other. Anyway, Alex has worked as a independent contractor for residential artistic metals (chandeliers, gates, handrails, etc) but business has been very slow for him the last year and he's been struggling financially. So I was glad to hear how he got a new job a week ago and it pays good. I congratulated him and after some small talk, he told me he needed around $340 dollars to finish a welding work order he received a while back and the client was really pressuring him for the final product. Without hesitation I said OK and asked him where he needed the money sent to. He gave me the link to a website where I could order the materials he needed to finish the job and his address to ship them there. He told me he would repay me in 3 weeks when he got his payment.

Fast forward to when I got home from work, my wife and I chatted and talked about our days. As we were getting ready for bed, I told her ""Hey, btw. Alex reached out to me today and I let him borrow $340 dollars for a metal job he needs to finish"" And that's when the argument started. 

I should mention a few things. My wife and I have a shared account. We make around the same amount per week. Between the both of us, we make a decent amount of money. Not crazy amounts but we live very comfortable.

So she was upset because I made the decision without talking to her before saying yes to Alex but I told her it wasn't really that big a deal because Alex is going to pay us back before the end of the month (and he definitely will). Lending him the money isn't going to put us in any financial stress so I didn't see the need to call her and tell her about it before saying yes. She said it wasn't about me not asking for her permission because she would've agreed to lend him the money but the problem was that I didn't communicate with her before hand. I told her that if the roles were opposite, I wouldn't have gotten upset with her because it really wasn't going to affect us in any negative way. 

It wasn't like I was hiding it from her, I told her literally 3 hours after the conversation with Alex. I told her I now know how she feels about that kind of stuff and that I'll be sure to talk to her before I say yes to lending any of our money next time.

AITA for not consulting it with her or is she overreacting for the whole thing? Judge away.

"My brother and i have a very strained and complicated relationship, I love him because he is my brother. But as a person i am struggling to get along with him. He has been very coddled by my mom his whole life and doesn't really know how to act because of it. 

He blatantly refuses to give my husband a chance or try to bond with him by learning about his hobbies but he will force his hobbies down my husbands throat. A few days ago we went to Comic Con and he stayed the night at our place, we all went to the store and let him pick out his own soda and bought it for him and he didn't say thank you. Okay, whatever he's never been very good at thanking people. 

Well, that night we decided to try and teach him MTG (magic the gathering) real quick, my brother is a big baby and if he doesn't win/ get his way, he pouts and throws tantrums. So the game was going well and he was actually winning until my husband pulled out a really good combo and my brother was under the impression he lost and immediately gave up and pouted saying, ""I DON'T LIKE MAGIC!"" keep in mind, this was his first game. I had enough at this point and told him he was a big baby and that he was winning. 
And he just ignored me and continued sulking. 

The next day wasn't any better because he complained about the Con (that i bought the tickets for mind you) because nobody recognized his cosplay blah blah blah. We took him back to my parents house after the con and had dinner there. I then told my mom what happened and all she had to say was, ""yeah that sounds about what's to be expected when you two hang out."" This has kind of set me over the edge at this point because I am the only one who has to deal with his spoled brat attitude and i am seriously thinking about cutting him off until he gets his attitude together because i cannot deal anymore and I feel like it isn't fair to my husband either.

So, WIBTA if I did cut him off for a while? I know my parents would tell me I'm overreacting but I have dealt with his entitlement and crappy attitude since we were kids.

Quick edit: the Comic Con tickets were his and my husbands birthday gifts. Sorry i didn't clear that up beforehand."	Not the A-hole	0	0

One of our mutual friends gave me the girls number and told me she was interested. I texted the girl and we exchanged messages for a few days. I eventually ask her to get dinner. She agrees. During the dinner, I tried to holding a conversation with her and it’s just not happening. She’s not asking me any questions and I’m constantly moving from topic to topic trying to get her to engage a bit. The conversation was so stagnant and one-sided that I figured that maybe she was just looking for a free meal. Over the course of the date, I then begin to think that maybe something is wrong with her overall interpersonal skills because she is not holding her end of the conversation. Once we finish dinner, I ask if she wanted to go see a movie. She said she had to study for an exam tomorrow. I understood and drove her home. We hugged and that was the date. I got home and was exhausted from having to engage in a one-sided conversation for the entire date. I don’t initiate a text conversation with her and neither does she with me. 4 days later I get a text from her saying I “disappeared”. I told her I had just been busy. We continue the text conversation and discuss random things. The conversation eventually ends and I don’t ever hear from her again. I don’t initiate a text conversation either after that conversation. During the past week I have been having coworkers approach me asking if I had heard from the girl. I told them I haven’t and that I’ve been busy. Later, I hear from coworkers that the girl is upset with me and is accusing me of “ghosting” her. I understand that “ghosting” is wrong, but I don’t think what I did is considered ghosting. I responded to her texts, I just didn’t initiate another conversation with her nor a second date.

So... they were fired. They have since hired 2 new managers and they have one remaining from my stay. The owner still works there. And they have 2 other workers that were recently fired for things under their control. I am currently their only driver on this stores payroll. Since I was hired, they have a rule.  Carson doesn’t have to do the dishes (my old manager yelling at me over the dishes and continually making more and more things dirty to make me stay late along with other things we’re the causes of my panic attacks at work.) I do every side work they ask of me and never clock out until they tell me to. Which is always passed schedule but I’m aware so it doesn’t hurt. I sweep,  mop, drive, do the cut table, take out trash, and can do almost every job in the place without help besides roll out the final pizza dough, though I can top it. I try to help during my shift instead of doing side work or playing on my phone, so they asked me to come back to this job. I think my coworkers complain about me behind my back but never to my face. The manager on duty always switches jobs with me so nobody besides me is doing extra work.  I am in therapy for this as I know this isn’t a normal behavior for a 20 year old. Am I the asshole because I won’t do the dishes? Even though they made it a rule themselves that I never do dishes. They haven’t even asked since I got back but have jokingly talked about me hulking out over dishes and just not to ask me to do it. The owner knows as well and I’m currently their only driver.

My brother was supposed to intern at a firm called ""Firm A"" in a foreign country, which had been repeatedly promised by my dad and his brother, only to find out that it was not what they were advertising because my brother ended up being given a ""Customer Complaint"" internship at ""Firm B"". My brother was obviously very annoyed at this, and told my dad about all of it. Then my brother later got a very stern calling from my dad's brother, telling him off for not being thankful about the opportunity that was given. 

Then my dad later writes ""Ok, I got worried so I messaged him, and it's clear your working for ""Firm B"" , not with  ""Firm A"". 

My mother was very annoyed at the lack of communication because this was something that she was pushing my dad to get, only for it to not materialise. I later messaged her in private, telling her that ""This all reminds me of the times when I've asked dad to do something. He almost always miscommunicates and tries to make others look like the bad guy"".

For a little context, my dad and I almost always tend to fight over the smallest of things, and the same goes for my mom. To add onto this point, I recently started dating an American woman who has a career, and every single one of our conversations has been about how he disapproves of her and my decision. I've told him that she deserves to have a career and make a name for herself, only for him to write those words of as ""motherhood statements"", and that ""A woman should only sit and live in the house. She shouldn't have a career. You're not being logical at all"". 

If it's also of any interest, he has often gotten drunk and has hurled numerous abusive statements such as calling me ""an asshole"" in an unprovoked manner, and when I confront him about this the next day, he doesn't even apologise for it, and instead denies he got drunk. 

My mother inadvertently showed the message I sent to her to my dad, and when I asked her about it, she told me that my dad was fighting with her about the problem. Later in the evening, my mom showed me a couple of texts in which my dad told my mom ""You're a nasty woman, you always complain about everything I do"". 

Little did I know, my dad ended up saying that I'm an absolute idiot for saying that and that I should be thankful for what he's done.

I recently came out to my brother about being a transgender person. He was accepting and it was over all a win on my part. 

Before I came out to him, I had a bit of a mental break down. As a combative measurement I decided to cut my hair so that I could relieve some of the emotional stress. It was honestly not a great idea, but at the time it couldn't be avoided.

Because of that hair cut I've put a time constraint on being able to come out. I've been able to hide it from my parents, but its only a matter of time. A few days ago I had a close call, where my father pulled my hood off, my hair was braided and he didn't see the ends so he didn't notice. 

Afterwards my brother told me that keeping this secret was stressing him out and that I really messed up. That it was a burden for him and he'd rather have found out with everyone else. He told me that I needed to tell our parents, he would go to a friends house or something because it made him uncomfortable to talk about and I could explain things to them.

The reason I came out to my brother first was because I wanted him to support me in coming out to our parents. I had tried to come out to my mother before, but her reaction was extremely negative and she basically avoided the fact that transgender people exist. So I wanted him to help me tell them and to have my back if things went south.

I tried expressing this to him, but he said that this was my problem and I shouldnt expect that of him. I knew that he would step up if I did it right in front of him and I didn't give him a choice. I don't think he's completely accepted me so would it be wrong of me to force this decision on him?

bwzycs	2019-06-05 07:42:06	Penguinz90	AITA for escalating co-workers behavior at work to HR?	"****FURTHER UPDATE****

HR told my manager to hold off on the meeting this weekend as they want to have either my managers boss or someone from HR there too.  No doubt to make sure my co-workers don't pull their usual bullshit.

****UPDATE****

We had a conference call with my manager, her boss and HR.  They asked me what my perspective was as to what is going on and I said there is an extremely unprofessional culture in the store that ultimately will only hurt the store and prevent it from growing business wise like it should.  They asked me specifically what I had experienced and I told them about the behaviors, pettiness, how territorial they were and how that could only become a negative in the grand scheme of things.  I told them how I've been hollered at, cursed at, told to shut up...you name it.  I said I just can't see me coming into work for the next 10+ years with this environment.

My manager verified everything I said and said the behavior continues despite her calling them out on it (which she has and they yelled back at her).  I mentioned to HR what their response was and how shocked I was that they felt entitled enough to speak so disrespectfully to their boss that way.

HR apologized for the fact that I have had to deal with such poor behavior.  She said that is NOT acceptable on any level and no one should feel like they are walking on eggshells like I am.  She asked if this behavior transpired in front of patients and I verified that it has.  

They asked me to put some ideas together on what can be done to rectify the situation and send it to them in an email and that they would do everything they could to make sure this is stopped.  I then got off the call while they continued to talk.

My manager came in and gave me a big hug and said she appreciates me and that she doesn't want me to leave (she is actually a very nice and sincere person, just sucks at conflict resolution).  She said she was frustrated because HR asked her why it got this far before they heard about it because she has been telling her boss for ages about it and just told him the other day it was getting worse, yet it took for me to reach out to get the conversation going with HR.

In the email I said there should be a system implemented where when someone is out of line they get a verbal warning that is actually written up and signed by the employee and manager.  After 2 verbals it becomes a written notice that goes to HR for review.

I then said policies need to be implemented that EVERYONE follows, and I listed about 8 or 9 things that currently are issues and how to deal with them such as rotating patients with employees as they come in so no one monopolizes all of the sales, and clear guidelines for returns, and that everyone needs to do repairs and dispensing and employees can no longer pass that off to others so they can be ready to catch the next sale.

I showed it to my manager and she loved it, I then signed it and sent it off to HR and her boss.

We are going to have a meeting this weekend where we will go over all of this and everyone will need to sign off on all of the policies including acknowledging the verbal/written notice system.

So I feel better knowing HR was respectful of what I had to say and took it seriously and that my manager was on board with everything.  

Thank you all so much for your kind responses, they really helped me feel confident this morning and empowered for this call.  You all are amazing kind souls and really helped lift my spirits! 

****ORIGINAL POST****

I work in a place where we get a 2 percent commission fee on eyeglass sales.  I just started here a couple of months ago.  One coworker in particular has flat out told me she doesn't like me, hasn't since day one and has even said there is no reason for it, but that's how it is so stay the fuck away from her.  If I so much as accidentally get too close to her (cramped areas such as around register) she snaps at me.  On a few occasions customers have come to me and asked me if I could help them, so I did.  She then yelled at me (in front of customers) for stealing her sale.  She thinks that because she says hello to someone as soon as they walk in the store it makes them her customer.  Coworker #2 hollered at me for 5 minutes straight the other day because her customer returned a pair he bought but didn't like on her day off and purchased a different pair and I put the sale in my name (per my managers instructions).  She yelled that was fucked up, and after I told her our manager told me to ring it up in my name she said that was bullshit and I shouldn't have listened to her, but rang it up in her name.  She was stomping her feet, cursing at me, hollering...you name it.

These two have caused others to quit before by acting this way.  I was hired because I have over 20 years experience in the optical field and I'm good at my job.  My husband thinks they are threatened by me.  I'll be damned if I let them run me off.  

My manager feels like she's talked to them repeatedly about their behavior and it hasn't changed over the years so there isn't much more to be done.  I escalated the matter to her boss (who has told me he is fed up with their shit) and we have a conference call with him, my manager and HR tomorrow.

AITA for escalating this?  My manager says I need to have thicker skin and just accept that they are screamers and strong willed individuals.  As a previous manager and business owner before that I can say without a doubt that I feel her response is bullshit, and I would have fired them ages ago.  Thoughts?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I just charged my dad $65 to tune his laptop, flush all viruses, etc. I also charge him money for rides whenever he needs to go drink with friends or something. 

The kicker: My parents and grandparents have done plenty for me unconditionally when I was young. I'm also not exactly in a financial turmoil. Infact I'm doing quite ok b/c I live with my mother while I continuously search for a job, being 100% honest. 

My POV: I don't feel like it's my duty to look after my dad and his parents. I also work a really shitty job and I suffer from extremely low self esteem due to siblings and cousins all doing better in life than me. I have depression and other mental health issues that doesn't get addressed at all. I also feel like my family members all favor my siblings and cousins more than me b/c of their much higher status so I think that my moral obligations ought to be the least of my concerns since there's no point in being moral to them if they're just going to like my siblings and cousins more than me."

bwzwuy	2019-06-05 07:35:34	aitaornah	AITA for telling my friend that I don't want to drink on the Fourth of July?	"I'm the last in my group of friends to turn 21 (They're 2-3 years older than me). Of course, there's a whole ""FREE TO DRINK"" phase following that. At the beginning, I was down to get tipsy, but as time went on, I find myself slowly not enjoying it like I used to. Unlike my friends, I just want to stay in and chill instead of go out when it comes to drinking. To top it all off, I recently found out that I have scar tissues in my pancreas that have not healed for about 3 months now, so the doctor was very strict about what not to consume (alcohol included).

&#x200B;

Throughout my second semester of being 21 in college, one of my friends (let's call her Felicia) always went almost every week to one of the local bars that had an all-you-can-drink special on Thursday nights. I couldn't even go most of the time because I had to work until an hour before the bars close. However, I noticed that every time I was able to attend, all she did was either a) criticize me for not drinking enough, and b) call me out for not spending enough time like we used to my freshman year. When I told my friends about my pancreas, everyone but Felicia was understanding. Well, she seemed to understand, but then she would still try to guilt trip me whenever I didn't want to come.

&#x200B;

Fast forwarding to present day: we're all talking about getting together for the Fourth of July. We were originally planning to visit Felicia in her hometown, but it all depends on work since me and everyone else in the friend group are working for the summer two hours away. Then out of nowhere, she mentions, ""It falls on a Thursday so y'all know what that means..."" I automatically knew that she was going to come down and drag us to the bar, so I didn't respond. A few days later, she calls me and asks if I was still in. I wasn't exactly sure what the plans were since no one decided, so I was confused. Then she tells me, ""I'm about to tell everyone that we're going to the bar, and you're coming no matter what."" I didn't want to miss out on all the fun, but I also didn't want to be miserable in a crowded bar. So I suggested seeing the firework show and they can bring their own drinks there.

&#x200B;

Her response: ""Ugh, you need to be more fun and drink more when we go to the bar.""

&#x200B;

That was the last straw for me. I snapped at her and said, ""You decided yourself that we're all going to the bar. Why do you always have to prioritize drinking whenever we all hang out? You guys can do whatever you want, but stop constantly trying to pressure me to do it.""

&#x200B;

She got pissed called me a bitch and hung up. Now our other friends are telling me that I was blown out of proportion. I know there could've been a way to handle this whole entire better. However, I don't feel bad for standing my ground and calling her out.

Well, I (F) messed around with a friend (M) of about 8 years one night that we were drunk. It ended in a really awkward and deeply shameful regret the following morning due to the fact that we're both involved in long-term long distance relationships, my bf was away in school when it happened and his gf lives in a completely different state. Just to start this off, I am well aware that IATA in this part and that this behavior was and is not excusable no matter the circumstances. Living and acknoweledging what I did has been torturous because as much as I valued that friendship, I would never leave my SO for them, it was a crude decision made on clouded inhibitions of two sad and lonely people. I am also not looking for relationship advice. 

  
My issue is the following. As I stated above, I'd never leave my SO for this person. After a thorough discussion of our actions we both agreed to never do anything like this again due to the high stakes in our own personal lives. My friend did ask me for one favor and that was to please keep our friendship intact and seperate from this whole mess as he would hate to see it be destroyed over this. My issue is that I don't want to keep the friendship going. Yes, we were drunk. Yes, I consented even though he asked multiple times if it was ok. I simply no longer feel safe/comfortable with him and have not hung out with our friend group due to the anxiety of seeing him. Early on in our friendship, and far before we were in our current commited relationships, he's made multiple advances, some of which have stretched as far as surprise kissing me, and I've rejected them all because I didn't feel attracted to him romantically. He is an honest and good man so I always found some way to excuse it but I no longer want anything to do with him. I feel guilty because why didn't I drop him as a friend when there were already red flags then, what makes this any different?   


I know I will have to talk to him soon so I dread possibly having to end things because it would cause a weird rift on our friend group. It's not like I want my other friends knowing about this either as I'm not exactly proud of it... WIBTA for ending the friendship?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

He told me his ex that he just broke up lived with his family (in Wa) due to her own family issues. I was 17, a senior in HS, she was 18 and just failed her senior year of HS and my husband was 21. Of course she was mad she got dumped so she did the whole Twitter fight thing but I basically invented twitter fighting, so she would tweet something talking shit ab me, I’d see it, ruin her, then she would delete her tweet and cry to my husband’s mom about me. 
The first time I flew to Wa to meet his parents, we were lied to about his ex “not” being there. She was. It was awkward. His mom was rude. Trip from hell. FF to 2017, we got married, his ex had joined the army and left but somehow managed to meet someone who got stationed in Fort Lewis and married him so she was right back in Wa. His family basically just coddled her and her husband, constantly invited them to family things, etc. My husband and I lived in NC but I was honestly disturbed by how close they all were and how they constantly posted things on social media while all but ignoring my husband and I. Literally, we never even got a wedding gift. 
She ended up getting pregnant and his sister threw her gender reveal and his parents threw a baby shower for her. I have expressed multiple times how disrespected and unwelcome they make me feel, and they literally never apologized. They say things like “being offended is a personal choice” and “our relationship up with her has nothing to do with you” which is true but also extremely cold when being used in a family situation. Basically, I’ve never felt welcomed here and I love my husband but it’s so hard for me to accept this relationship and the disrespect. Don’t get me wrong.

So I am korean and currently doing my mandatory military service. Background story some of my company soldiers don't really like me cause I am different. Lived overseas all my life I relate to americans more then koreans. And I made a few mistakes which my fellow soldiers didn't really appreciate. So some of them actually like really dislike me. Anyway this happened like a week ago.
 In our company we have around 5 washing machines and we put our laundry on top to be next (inefficient I know). And we have this kind of personal laundry nets to put our laundry in. Anway I had a lot of laundry to do and so I put 2 laundry nets on top of a washing machine and later that night I did laundry with another soldier (Name P).  Well another soldier (let's call him M) also had his laundry net and it got mixed in with mine but me without realizing grabbed his and one of mine leaving the second behind. Well when I put all the laundry together with P's laundry it looked alot but it was laundry for two so I overlooked it.

Later that night he was looking for his laundry but obviously I didn't know anything about it. But M went on to look for his laundry and found it mixed in with mine. I got called out of my room and he was fuming! Straight up cussed me out. I was so confused and went on to show me his laundry mixed in with mine. Well he started to push and not really hit ( I mean if he was it was pretty pathetic) but kinda like rough me up. He was screaming and cussing and punching the washing machines. Well i was in the wrong obviously so I apologized and helped pull out his clothes. While I was doing that still cussing me out calling me a retard ect. Then I mixed up his clothes and ONE of P's underwear and he proceeded to throw it at me and spit on it. 

I felt bad that night really bad cause he was looking for it for like 40 mins. But over fucking laundry? Like really????? He even mentioned that he would report it to the captain and my platoon leader (which wouldn't be a problem cause fucking laundry...) but I am a soft guy and don't like confrontation i was pretty hurt by his actions and words. I wanted to have a good relationship with my company members but I thought about it and I started to get mad.

&#x200B;

Okay so first off I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. I already know your answer based off that first sentence is yes, I am the asshole. well, hold on, don't judge yet. I've been in the same friend group since middle school, but there are small 'cliques' in it that I have switched in and out of. Right now the people I've been hanging out with are very attention seeking (not that every high schooler isn't), and drama seems to follow them everywhere. 

Anyways, to the story: we were all hanging out on the beach one night a month ago, with my older friends who drove us there. The youngest one in our friend group (Adriana) thought she saw someone she knew so yelled and started making conversation in the dark as she walked closer. Then she realized that that was not who she thought, but the guy (Patrick) had told us he and his friends (Fred and Theo) were by the lifeguard tower if we wanted to hang. So we met them all blah blah blah. I got to hook up with one of them (Fred), Adriana and Patrick paired up, and Sarah with Theo. Anywaysss we all hung out the next day (4 girls, 3 guys- one girl third wheeling). She (Diane) gets all mad about third wheeling blah blah blah, later ends up dating the Patrick. 

Flash forward now that you have background information.. so my best friend was not there that night (Selena), but she has hung out with the guy that I hooked up with and developed a crush on him. she hadn't told me initially, but I could tell, and I've only been able to hang out with the guys 3 times since we originally met them because my mom is hecka strict. he had already asked me to prom before they had hung out, and I felt really bad about it. I like him but not as much as I think she does. I facetime him every night n shit but I still feel bad. I ended up ranting to someone about being (not jealous) but like jealous in the way where it's fine if you don't say anything to the people involved because it's just your internal monkey brain telling you what to think. but that person ended up telling my best friend that I was ""mad"" about it, which I never was. This resulted in Selena asking the guy to choose between us. I thought he would choose her, and so did his best friend, they'd hung out more, seemed like they had more chemistry, etc. but he ended up saying my name which just made me feel like a shitty friend. I would have rather had him choose her over me, even though she said she would rather have had him say neither over me. I didn't personally want to ask him because I didn't think the answer would do anything other than cause problems and its unfair to make people choose other people and ultimatums and shit. and now last night he was talking to my best friend about the whole situation because she was upset (which is understandable), and he said that he regrets choosing me, but she wouldn't tell me the full reason. I feel like a dick in this whole situation because if I would have backed off there wouldn't be any conflict. i don't know what to do. so, AITA????"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I can already see some positive effects with my own kitten. I was thinking about registering her as an ESA and having her live with me at college. My mom was surprisingly on board. My therapist was surprisingly NOT. Now I’m not sure if I’m taking advantage of the system or not. WIBTA? 


Hi! I’m 19F and will be a sophomore at college next year. I’m home for the summer but I’m already signed up to stay in the dorms next year.

A couple weeks ago my family got a kitten. She was meant to be a barn cat but she was gonna stay in my room until she was big enough. However, I’ve fallen head over heels for her. 

I also have pretty bad ADHD. I take medicine for it, and see a therapist once every couple of months. I was researching it and it turns out ESAs can actually be really good for people with ADHD, because it establishes a routine that you can’t break, because there’s a living thing depending on you. I’ve already noticed this happening here at home - I’ve been going to bed a lot earlier, because my kitty starts to yell at me if I’m not up in my room before midnight, lol. I’m getting more done because I have cat-related tasks that put me in a productive mindset throughout the day. She makes me really happy, and my anxiety hasn’t been nearly as bad lately. 

It’s only been about 2 weeks since we got her and I just feel.... better.

I was just sorta lightly entertaining the idea of registering her as an ESA. I tested the waters with my mom and asked her what she would hypothetically think of it, expecting her her to act like it was stupid, and then I would move on. But she surprisingly seemed really on board with the idea, and even though I was just asking about the possibility of it, she started to treat it like a plan that was already happening. She told me to talk to my therapist about the idea, since my appointment was a couple weeks away.

That appointment was today. After we’ve talked a bit, I ask him if he’s had any experience with emotional support animals. He sorta scoffs and laughs and says “well I mean anyone can get one, you can even do it online now!” I told him about my research and how I was thinking about registering my cat, and asked if he would help me. He basically immediately said he’d “rather not be involved in any of that”. He asked where the cat would live and I said in my dorm with me and he said “ah, so there’s the real reason”. He told me to talk to my doctor or get it done online. 

I WAS thinking that this whole thing would be a really good help to my ADHD and anxiety, but now I’m sorta afraid that I’m just taking advantage of the system and trying to justify it in my mind. I don’t want to take her into grocery stores, or on planes, or anything like that. I just want to be able to live with her. I really do think she’ll help me. But I know this is a touchy subject and I don’t want to be THAT person. WIBTA for going through with this?"	Asshole	0	0

bwzcb5	2019-06-05 06:14:41	fuckinghatemymanager	WIBTA if I told my transgender coworker that our manager has made transphobic comments about her?	"About a week ago my manager decided to get drunk at work while her trustworthy bartender/previous manager, did inventory. The bartender was talking about my trans coworker, who identifies as a woman, to which my manager responded, “she’s a boy anyway.” The bartender later told one of our other coworkers and she mentioned it to me in confidence. This was very upsetting to me, as my trans coworker had previously left a job where she was very discriminated against by her closeted republican manager. 

Two days ago this bartender got drunk at work and decided to spit out the same conversation to the people working and those sitting at the bar. I’m afraid that if I don’t mention it to her, it will be as if we all knew and no one told her. I am a huge empath and feel as if I was in her position I would want to be aware. I wouldn’t want to work under someone like that and/or for them to be removed from their position. At the same time, I am afraid that it will hurt her and it’ll just be like throwing salt in a wound. 

Some extra knowledge: 

\- I have had lots of previous issues with this manager, as have others 

\- My coworkers are currently in the process of getting ready for an intervention with my manager since they feel she’s terrible (yes, I agree) 

\- She allowed an employee to repeatedly touch female employees inappropriately

Should I confront my manager? Should I tell my coworker? How can I tactfully go about this? WIBTA for disclosing this to my trans coworker? "	Not the A-hole	0	0

I didn't really have any University or Career in mind, so I just took as much College entrance exams as I could. My Mom had a job in another state, it paid more so she stayed there. I got into a University there, she asked me if I'd like to study there so we'd see more of each other. I wasn't excited about it. I wanted to stay in the state I grew up in. Go to a University where most of my HS friends were going. Be able to go back to my hometown and visit old friends during the weekends and stuff like that. But before I could even decide my parents decided to just move there. The whole family, me and my 4 siblings. Because life is short and we need to spend more time with each other etc. College was supposed to be an experience. Where I'd be independent and live on my own stuff like that. But nope, we moved. Couldn't even get a dorm cause we lived close to the Universities. Fast forward to now. I'm graduating in a few days, my 2nd sister is in another state in her 2nd year of college. My 3rd sister is starting soon, apparently she got into med school, back in our home state. Now my Parents are asking me to move back there with her.You should start looking for a job there in verbatim. So someone can watch over her, make sure she's not partying too much or whatever. But I'm just pissed. I never wanted to move, I wanted the college life both my sisters are getting. Instead I was treated like a fucking child. Now they want me to start over and move back to the City I never wanted to leave in the first place. So AITA?	Asshole	0	0
bwz53e	2019-06-05 05:47:56		AITA this happened just now. I will accept any judgment but I need to know if I’m in the wrong	"I don’t even know where to start. I was sober when we arrived at the bar in my small town and I was having a good time. I left the bar briefly to go get pods for my juul bc the convenience store is across the street. When I came back, these two guys basically blocked the door to the bar (both doors were open, they stopped at the doorway to stare at me) and while this went on for maybe 3 full seconds (doesn’t seem like long until you’re in the moment) I said excuse me and motioned that I was trying to get past them. They watched me go up the stairs to the other part of the bar and I heard them say, “what a CAT” like I don’t know what that means but they were watching me when I was approaching the bar doors and I think that’s why they wanted to look at me as I was walking in. I felt disgusted and scared and felt like that was going to ruin my night and decided no, I wouldn’t let that happen again, I should have a good night despite the fucking creeps. Less than one fucking minute later they come upstairs and are staring at me from across the bar. I tell my boyfriend that these are the guys that were creepy (I’d told him the whole first part about how they stared, and what they looked like) and he said not to worry, they’re just regulars at the other shitty bar and they’re shitty people. I don’t think that’s a good excuse but I let it go and try to have fun, which I succeed at. But then these guys come up to him and they start fucking shooting the breeze. And I’m expecting my boyfriend to say literally ANYTHING to them so they won’t be weird to me or maybe at the VERY least call them out for being shitty. Their eyes were on me until we went downstairs and I forgot about it, and then I got drunk, feeling safe to do so. We spend a couple more hours there and they are completely off my mind until the topic comes up again (when I’m drunk, feel free to use this in my judgement), and I start losing it about my past and how I’ve been assaulted multiple times and he shouldn’t have acted so casual and normal around them since he knows how stressed and scared I get. We get home and I’m still on about it and he says “it’s 2019 what do you expect?! These things happen” And then I called him disgusting and found a quiet spot in the neighborhood to clear my head, which is where I’m writing this. I didn’t think he would have this mindset and I truly want to be the asshole in this situation so I know he’s a good boyfriend and I’m not overreacting. There’s many good attributes to him and he’s honesty the one I think I’m going to marry but tonight took me back a bit, and I’m astonished and hurt and disgusted and confused and I don’t know what to think.

bwz4w3	2019-06-05 05:47:11	meanmom43935	AITA for telling my relatives not to talk to my young daughter about boys or her looks?	"I have a daughter, Emma, who is 6 going on 7, going into second grade in the Fall. I'm her mom, so of course I think she's beautiful, but realistically she is exceptionally very pretty and it's the thing everyone comments on about her, which bothers me AND her. People also always tie that to her 'breaking boys' hearts' or teasing her about boyfriends or marrying boys. She's not even 7 years old yet, but people have been saying this type of stuff since she was a baby.

Emma has never liked this, and since kindergarten if someone says she's pretty she'll say, 'I'm kind and smart too' or 'I am a good helper and like to share too.' She also gets upset and draws inward when people tease her about breaking boys' hearts or having a boyfriend. Since she was maybe two years old she has always talked about marrying girls and thinking boys are icky, take that as you will; we are. We don't expect a little child to have her sexuality figured out but we also don't want to make a big deal about it or 'correct' her in case she does end up wanting to marry a woman.

So long story short, after Easter, I sent an e-mail out to our family and close friends asking them if they could ease up on talking about her appearance and teasing her about boys after she cried that night because her Grandma said she'd have to marry a boy and she didn't want to. You'd think I asked my family to cut off limbs or eat a pile of dog doo based on the response and things have been tense since, with lots of passive aggressive comments about how I 'won't let them say ANYTHING' and how what they're saying is 'normal.' Her paternal grandparents responded that they are going to 'just skip' her birthday party in case they 'offend' me.

My husband (and my brother and his sister) are the only ones who don't think I'm being an asshole here, but now my extended family makes me think I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but these comments really do upset Emma a lot, so I don't know what to do here.

EDIT: Since a bunch of people have asked, this is the e-mail sent to our families:

""Just a head's up, we're trying something new. Emma has told us that it upsets her when people compliment on her appearance or tease her about boys, so we'd all appreciate it if no one made comments like that to her. You know she rarely fusses, so if she says something bothers her, we want to try to take it seriously, and appreciate your help.""

bwz4s7	2019-06-05 05:46:47	aita376415	AITA for not wanting my wife to be alone with one of our friends?	"Throwaway for privacy reasons.

My wife and I have a friend named R.  I would consider R a good friend and we sometimes hang out and get drunk together, both at my house and out on the town.  However, R and my wife were friends before we met and R just recently came back into her (our) life.

R works odd shifts and has a son that my wife adores.  I'm not big on kids myself, but the kid has had a hard life and I do my best to be a friend to him (he calls me Uncle D - obvious alias).

Just this past week, R asked my wife if she could pick up his son from school, as he'll be out of town working a job.  I have no problem with this and fully welcome it.  She is just helping out a friend of hers and ours.

However, this lead to R coming to pick up his son while I am at work, therefore leading to him and my wife being alone in our house.  I think that this is very inappropriate and made my feelings known.

I trust my wife.  I really do.  That being said, I still don't think that it's appropriate for a single man to be alone in our house with her.  Maybe i'm just old fashioned or something in that respect.

Anyway, she got mad because I voiced my displeasure with this.  We got into a small squabble over it.  She declared that she is a Christian woman (I am an atheist, but she is actually a Christian I respect in regards to her faith) and that she wouldn't disrespect me or herself like that.  Again, I believe her and said that it was still inappropriate and even encouraged her for us to have a talk with her pastor (who I am casual friends with).

Daniel was hosting the kickback and kicked him out, told him he had to call his parents and leave or he was calling the cops on him for tresspassing.

So I am a programmer, in my parents mind that equals IT.

Any time they need something done with their phones or computer they want my help.

At first I was like ""yea, sure, let me show you how it's done"" for anything they wanted, wether it be downloading music/video, googling stuff, moving files from their phone to the computer etc.

This year my mom got an iphone after I pleaded her to get an android(because I knew she would ask for my help and I never touched an apple product in my life) but she insisted even after I told her I have no idea how to use it. Let it be known that this is her FIRST smartphone.

And of course she gets annoyed everytime I fail to help her despite my best efforts because I just never ever touched that OS and if she wants me to learn it I need her phone for a couple weeks.

The same goes for our brand new Smart TV, which I never touch nor use nor see. I have told my parents that I have no idea how to use it or their weird modem with their special internet channels(mostly Russian shows).

My dad gets annoyed because I get annoyed that he REFUSES to learn anything(almost anything)
Asked me to send an email I give him a 10 min tutorial on how to do it.

Next time he asks I show him again.

The 10th time I show him how.

The 20th time I ask him why doesn't he do it himself  he says ""I don't know how"" and I say ""I have shown you 10+ times"" he says ""so what? You need to do what I ask without any questions""

Today he asked me to send an sms he got to my mom's mail and I confront him saying ""Why don't you ever learn how to do it?"" And he just answers
""what do you care, I ask for your help once a week just do it."" And of course he gets angry at me for even ASKING.(and he asks for my help for anything and it happens daily)

bwyybz	2019-06-05 05:23:05	blobby_mcblobberson	AITA for cutting a friend out of my life?	"ETA spacing/clarification. AITA for cutting a depressed person out of my life? We have mutual friends, do I need to salvage the friendship?

I met a friend in this post-graduate program, and we hung out a lot initially, but then at one point I just stopped being able to tolerate him. This coincided with a period of depression for him, I know, but he started calling me ""endearing"" names like ""fatty"" (for which he has apologized and explained cultural differences) and generally made me feel uncomfortable (which I don't know how to fix, because again, he's apologized and this is non-specific behavior). 

My turning point was one night he pinched my forearm and called me chubby (which supposedly is a term of endearment in his family). He apologized for that. But I no longer felt like being his friend, something snapped in me that day. When I said this he called me a child. Then when I told him that was super not okay, he said he didn't mean it in a bad way-- just that some of my behavior is childlike. I apologized genuinely for hurting him, but something still felt off.

The thing that makes me feel like an asshold is he tries to take responsibility for his actions, and I know he cares sincerely. On the other hand I dont know why but I feel like he doesnt listen to what I say. I also have felt like he's focused too much on me. Once, we went on a hike with a mutual friend; and at one water break I just felt him searching my face with his eyes and I couldn't stand to look at him (makes my blood boil just thinking about that, I wanted to yell at him)... I have left communal chats and withdrawn from the group because I feel like he's fixated on me, which I can't confide to anyone becuase it comes off as self-centered and paranoid (which I guess I am now). 

Another thing though, nobody else seems to have a problem with him! So maybe I'm the asshole. But I also don't have this problem with other people, this isn't a pattern for me. He says it's not a pattern for him either though... And again, he was going through a depressive phase. Maybe I have been overreacting. When we had first started the program I had been going through a breakup and was looking for emotional support, and maybe experienced some attachment, which makes me feel like maybe I led him on. I quickly recovered and put boundaries down on what I was comfortable with. However despite all his apologies I have just lost trust in, and patience for, anything he says because he'll apologize for hurting me but not accept when I want distance. He's said he wants to ""help"" me, when I don't need help. I know he cares. I know he feels genuinely hurt. I don't think he's a narcissist (but I've considered it to validate my crazy feelings). I feel ungrateful and overdramatic. I feel CRAZY. But I also feel tired, and terrified of running into him, even though nothing threatening happened. I just don't know if my emotional response is warranted, if I maybe led him on, and if cutting out a depressed friend was the right move. 

The last contact we have he texted a blanket apology for anything he might have said to offend me, and I didn't accept it because it just didn't feel right: non-specific, and I never asked for another apology, just space. I do believe he was being sincere. Oh, also this was all in the span of like 5-6 months. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwyvbl	2019-06-05 05:11:54	WAr-cat	AITA for trying to distance myself and be a little cold to from my friend a year ago?	"So I’ve got a friend who I’ll name Martha. Towards the beginning of our friendship (early in high school) she was fine, or maybe I just didn’t see all the red flags then. But definitely as we grew older her bad habits and toxicity became apparent. She couldn’t hold a job for more than 2 months, complained all the time about everything, faked injuries if she felt like she wasn’t getting enough attention, copied off all my schoolwork (she honestly would not have passed high school without me, I even wrote her senior paper). The list goes on and on and I could tell you endless stories of the shenanigans I put up with around her. When one of our mutual friends was diagnosed with cancer, Martha even faked breaking her leg and walked around with a fake cast for 2 weeks before miraculously getting better. 

She also has a semi-incestuous relationship with her father. I can’t call it incest exactly because he is technically her stepfather, but he did raise her ever since she was 3. I never exactly caught them in anything scandalous, but a trustworthy mutual friend has caught them cuddling when Martha didn’t have a shirt on and Martha’s brother has confirmed with me that they’ve been having intercourse ever since she turned 18 at least, and he suspects maybe a little earlier too. This man has also given me and another friend free back rubs and just generally tried to get close to me when he could. I was never shy with her about disliking him.

I made the decision a year or so ago to just kind of gently let her go. I didn’t want to be mean and just suddenly cut her out of my life, so I just chose to slowly not respond to her texts and when I did respond to her texts I will admit I was probably pretty cold and a little uncaring. 

Out of the blue a couple days ago she sent me a message (it was actually a message meant to go to a different person with my name and a similar Facebook avatar) but we started to talk a little. I even agreed to hang out with her a bit tonight. Mostly I just wanted to see if she was any better; I wouldn’t mind letting her back in my life if she was any better and quit living with her stepdad. 

She isn’t really any better, in case you were wondering. But that’s not what I’m here to talk about. At one point in the conversation she mentioned how she stopped talking to me, and it was because all the things I was saying kind of hurt her feelings, and her dad didn’t feel comfortable around me(I didn’t know she ever even told her dad I didn’t like him lol). I’m a person who just doesn’t like it when people are upset at me for any reason, so this sort of bothered me and I just can’t shake it off. I just wanted to gently let her go so she wouldn’t think I’m straight up abandoning her like many of her other friends did, which she really felt bad about. Should I have done it a different way?"

My mum is a Nurse who works in a Hospital under the NHS and has a husband, 5 children and a grandchild to pay for (Father is a deadbeat)

I don't really speak to my family much for the simple reason that they only talk to me when they want something, in April on the day of my last Deadline my mum messaged me out of the blue asking if I had received my student finance, I said yes and she didn't hesitate to ask to 'borrow' money (Since I was a kid, if she asked to borrow money she would either only give me some back and hope I forget about the rest or refuse to pay me back at all)

Threw the years I've come to realize she is the bringer of most of her problems. She is extremely childish and absolutely hates hearing the word no. After we finished school, I moved a few hours away and spent 3ish years in a hellhole. Held a job for 2 years even though I absolutely hated it. During this time, she dropped out of college because she didnt think she could handle it anymore. Which I can respect, college is a lot. But, she was in charge if her own schedule, and attempted to finish her degree as fast as she could by putting too much on her plate. Thus her exhausting herself. 
After she dropped out, she's job jumped. She mostly worked at daycares and child care places and always quit over silly reasons. Like she had to go into work to early, or she couldnt handle that set of children. But would then complain about job hunting and having no money. 
Her and her boyfriend have an on/off relationship, because they're extremely toxic towards one another. Cheating, lying, manipulating. But she always goes back to him because she loves him. I cant stand him, but she doesnt think she'll ever love someone more than him. So she refuses to leave him. 
Currently, they're trying to find their own place because they live with his mother. BUT, they just bought a dog, considerably lowering their chances at finding a place. The dog is nice and all, but she's part pit, and the lowers the chances even more. She is constantly complaining she wants to get her own place but, no one will accept them because of the dog. And I just cant help but think that they didnt need the dog. Its not like it was a family pet they couldn't live without.

The teacher had these balloon holder things for a party she had a day before, so my friend picks it up and drops it about a foot off the ground to see how heavy it was, he dropped it and it made a weird plop noise. Turns out it’s weighed down by like 2 gallons of water at the bottom, so I pick it up and drop it and it plops again. 

He picks it up, drops it like 4 foot above the ground and it rips, water gushes out everywhere, the teacher was in the hallway, as class hadn’t started yet, in the end, the entire classroom was flooded with 2 inches of water. I go into the hallway and get the teacher, as she asks who did it, I told her it wasn’t me who broke it, and that it was my friend. My friend says “you did it too” so the teacher yells at ME and makes ME mop it up along with him, I got my parents called, and a referral, am I the asshole?

bwyrhj	2019-06-05 04:58:37		AITA For getting mad at my brother for taking his fiancés second name	"For the sake of keeping this private I’m going to refer to my families last name as Smith and my brothers fiancés last name as Redford. 

I’m very close to my older brother, he met his fiancé about 4 years ago and they have a beautiful daughter together. Most the time she’s great but she has a side to her that can be very difficult. She’s a self-proclaimed feminist, which is cool, only she uses that to instigate needless arguments sometimes at inappropriate times. When she met my grandpa, who’s 90 years old, he asked my grandma to take his plate away when he was finished, something she is more than happy to do and she went into some rant about how it shouldn’t be that way. They’re old and happy don’t get all angry at them because you have a problem. 

Anyway, she also decided their daughter would have her second name as she was the one birthing her. We totally respected that’s what she wanted to do. But one time she pissed me off because their daughter was being stubborn and my dad said, jokingly, “that’s the Smith in her!” And she snapped back “she’s not a Smith she’s a Redford.” It was just so stupid, and factually she will of course hey Smith traits too and that’s what he was saying. My brother never really speaks up for himself, she can be kind of rude to him sometimes. She gets really angry over silly things like him saying he likes a certain comedian or when he goes out with the boys. It’s their relationship but I can see he gets upset sometimes because she’ll just grill him and he’s so good to her (he works 6 days a week as a landscape Gardner to put food on their table) and she never really shows him any respect and can belittle him sometimes. 

Anyway they announced they’re getting married and he told us that he’s taking her name, Redford. We were all a little taken a back, my dad sort of huffed a little bit we’re all English so no one really said anything. When we went for a beer that night I mentioned it in passing and he was like “yeah it was my decision not hers” and I could just tell he was lying, I know him too well. And I got a little agitated and was like “you don’t have to do everything little thing she says you know. Taking her name is something you should decide, not her, it’s bullshit if she’s making you do that”And he kind of mumbled into his beer. 

The next day I get a text from her GRILLING ME. I’ve never had anything like it. She basically said it’s none of my business and I’m an arsehole for getting involved and my brother is his own man and doesn’t need another white male telling him what’s right. 

I apologised and but said that I just wanted to make sure it was his decision and not just hers and she responded back even more pissed. I think I over stepped the line and I admit that but I’m just so sick of her puppeting my big bother. Anyway, she’s still mad and won’t talk to me. He’s being off as well. I didn’t mean anything by it but it just rubbed me the wrong way."		1	0
bwyre9	2019-06-05 04:58:18	Lord-Marble	WIBTA explaining to my friend why no one likes them?	"I have a friend who I’ve known for about a year now. We both go to a boarding school, they being non-binary AMAB and living in the boy’s dormitory.
Consistently, every conversation they’re in, they make it about themselves and how much their life sucks and stuff, crying over it but turning around and snapping at people for asking if they’re ok.
They also fail to realize how uncomfortable they make their dorm mates. They’re always trying to hit on guys despite being turned down several times already (and KNOWING they’re straight), while making REALLY sexual jokes about how gay they are (they treat their sexuality as their personality) and how much they wanna suck dong. I’ve seen how uncomfortable the guys are around them making these jokes. They’re also obnoxiously loud, even when people are studying and tell them to stop. They take it as a personal offense.
They’ve starting complaining more and more, calling all the guys ‘trash’ for not wanting to hang out with them, WIBTA for explaining why? I’m just concerned that they might overreact.


EDIT: I completely forgot to mention this, but their dorm mates are retaliating not just by avoiding them, but by deadnaming them (calling them by their birth name instead of their chosen name) and scribbling out their chosen name on their dorm room door, replacing it with their deadname underlined. It’s seriously affecting my friend’s gender dysphoria and anxiety, though this hasn’t changed the previously mentioned behaviors at all :/"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Recently my girlfriend had asked me if we could go to our local shelter to look at dogs, we both love dogs and we were thinking of getting one In the future after we were better established, as we just moved into our apartment which before we lived in our apartment we lived with our parents. 

But anyways we went to the pet adoption agency and decided to adopt a pit bull named billy who is absolutely the best dog ever, when we saw him we knew how amazing of a dog he was but because of this I feel like we made a knee jerk decision and decided to adopt him. 

We have gave it some thought after we adopted him which we only adopted him 2 days ago and with our college schedule and our work schedules of varying hours to the point were one of us is always going to be gone or both of us at the same time, as well as our college schedules coming up and the fact that we live in a small apartment where he has almost no space to play and roam and have fun. We just can’t figure out if he’s suffering or he’s okay with it, and we don’t know how it’ll be in the future for him. 

At this point we have decided that if he continues to live with us he may end up suffering more than being with a family that has a yard and he’s such a sweet dog I don’t think he’d have any trouble finding a good family hopefully.  Me and my girlfriend are just so scared of psychologically scaring him and him going to the wrong family. Not only that but we also sort of live paycheck to paycheck we don’t know if we’ll be able to confidently give him the pet care that he needs 



I had honestly always abhorred people who surrendered their animal and insisted that they were the scum of the earth but now I’m going to have to do the very thing that I hate and I’m at a loss for it. I can’t tell if I’m an asshole for it or I’m making the right decision."	Asshole	0	0

It pisses me off that he’s done something so irresponsible and honestly I don’t want to be any part of it. I think it’s selfish and I think she’ll grow to regret/resent it. She’s just a kid. 

Knowing I have to go and smile and be congratulatory goes against everything I feel at the moment. 

Would I be an ass if I said I was sick and didn’t go? The thought of the event alone is stressing me out.



Edit: when he told me he was going to propose I did express I was somewhat concerned as she has a wealth of mental health issues/anxiety/depression/bulimia as well as endometriosis/can’t have kids.

I thought piling on an engagement/wedding wouldn’t be very beneficial for her right now. When I suggested a promise ring I was told “promise rings are fucking stupid” so....

bwymvy	2019-06-05 04:42:10	Separate_Aioli	AITA for kicking 3 drunk girls out of my car at night b/c they were singing offensive songs?	"Full disclosure, this happened roughly a year ago while I was still in grad school. I was an uber driver at night to earn some extra money and would often pick up drunk college kids going to-from bars.

&#x200B;

So this night I picked up 3 drunk girls from a neighboring school. They were going from a campus pregame to some bar/club in the next town over. I'm a small female who drove strangers at night so I had a little laminated rule card hanging on the backseat. Basically no rude, drunken behavior, nothing that disturbs my driving otherwise I have the right to kick them out whenever. If they refuse I call the cops.

&#x200B;

On the way there the girls start drinking vodka out of water bottles and I ask them to stop several times. They do for a while but I still catch them sneaking sips. Then minutes later they start singing some sorority song (it was Party in the USA but with their sorority name put in). At one point this girl starts talking about one of their friends and they start chanting ""f\*ggot"" and laughing then they break out that same song and add his name into the lyrics and also a bunch of similar slurs. At this point I'm fed up. I've asked them several times to A) stop drinking in my car and B) calm down and shut up.

&#x200B;

Granted, I never said if they don't stop I'm kicking them out because in my mind I already gave them plenty of chances. I spot one of those little 24hr drive thru Taco Bells and pull over and tell them to get out of my car. I tell them to go ask the restaurant to call them another ride because I'm done. They get out in confusion and I just drive off. I reported the incident as advised but heard nothing back from Uber.

&#x200B;

So recently I was sharing stories of my uber driving days and told this little story. A few people thought I was a major asshole because I put those girls in a lot of danger by leaving them at a random Taco Bell parking lot at night. They think the right thing to do was to take them to their destination but report them after. Honestly I was just following the rules I set for myself and didn't think that much at the time. I was just fed up with their behavior. But WITA/AITA for what I did?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** The taco bell was open at that time and had a few other college kids inside. This was in a suburban college town so the only people out at that hour were other college students."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwymgw	2019-06-05 04:40:36		WIBTA if I skipped graduation?	"I’ve just finished up high school, graduating from an alternative program. I honestly didn’t think I’d end up graduating on time because I missed so much school in be previous years due to my mental health.

My alternative program was wonderful, I loved my teachers and the director, had friends, and tonight we had our graduation ceremony. I was extremely anxious, but I did it, dressed up and all. It was draining but I’m proud of myself and my dads proud of me too.

But that was just the small alternative programs individual graduation. We’re all encouraged to attend the larger graduation on Friday night if we want to.

I don’t want to.

I haven’t been back to that school in two years, and it doesn’t house good memories for me. I don’t hate the kids from my class but I’m not really close to most of them. Plus, the thought of the long and large ceremony is making my head spin.

My dad says I don’t have to go, but I have a couple of other family members who are trying to force me to go for the experience and because they want pictures there as well. They feel my alternative graduation wasn’t legitimate enough. I also have a couple of friends who say that I should suck it up.

I’ve had really bad anxiety my entire life but since switching schools I’ve been managing it more, and I don’t want to end up spiraling. I already went to one ceremony, I received my diploma, I celebrated, and I don’t think I could handle a bigger one.

bwylsn	2019-06-05 04:38:13	Denikke	AITA for not letting my partner sleep in	"This has been an occasional, ongoing argument (nothing serious, but we both get a little peeved with the other). And it basically comes down to: He would like to sleep in sometimes during the week, having me get up with the kids for school. I feel this is inconsiderate to ask for. And I'm aware, going based on just that, I DEFINITELY sound like tah...but bear with me  


  
There are definitely a few relevant points to this:  


\-This is specifically in the past 6 months. He got laid off work and is not currently working. I'm a stay at home mom. Previous to him losing his job, I was almost exclusively getting up with the kids, including an 8month period where I was effectively the only parent (he was away for work for those 8 months. During that time, he was home a total of 4 days). He usually works away from home a lot as well (gone for 2-4 days at a time)  
\-he falls asleep almost immediately. I have an ongoing battle with insomnia. It's been almost lifelong, but has gotten much worse in the last two years. It's rare that I fall asleep before 3am, no matter what I have tried. I'm still looking into options and help, and at this point am seriously considering more serious measures (melatonin, meditation, etc have been tried). But getting up at 6:30am means I'm frequently getting apx 3-4 hours of sleep on a decent nights. And I find it very difficult to fall back to sleep, so once I'm awake, I'm up for the day. I also cannot nap (he can and does), as it throws my sleep off even more.  


\-His version of 'sleeping in' is sleeping until noonish (the timing is not what bothers me, that's whatever). That gives him 12-14 hours of sleep for that night. I wake up 10-11am, giving me, ON A GOOD NIGHT, a maximum of about 8hrs of sleep. It is frequently less than that, more an average of 5-6 hours a night, although some nights it's more like 3hrs, at times less.  


\-He DOES sleep in on most weekends because the kids don't have school or anything to do in the morning. They're old enough to be independent, make their own breakfast and all that (this has never been an issue), so he sleeps in on the weekends (which I don't mind at all and is not an issue).   


  
He says it's unfair to expect him to get up \*every\* morning to make sure the kids get to school, and would prefer to split it more evenly (even 3/2). I say it's unfair to expect me to lose out on large chunks of what little sleep I can get when there's a perfectly capable parent who can deal with things that need to be done.  


He works hard, and I appreciate it. But he's not working right now. And I'm struggling. I've been struggling for a while (and attempting to fix or improve it), and if he were working and when he starts working again, I will happily go back to getting up with the kids (and suffering through it), but I don't feel out of line taking advantage of the situation that allows me to actually get a proper amount of sleep each night.

bwyj1k	2019-06-05 04:28:57	MushroomSundae	AITA for not letting someone stay at my apartment after their place burnt down?	"I live in an apartment with my partner and brother (and occasionally his girlfriend), in a rather small 2 room apartment. They're all still in college while I'm currently working full time.

Last Friday, I received a text to our group chat from my brother saying ""Can one of my juniors crash at our place for like 6 weeks? Next semester? Their house burnt down, just wanted to let them stay in the interim."" Turns out, my brother decided to just say ""ok"", essentially sending me the text, more as a ""notification"" rather than asking for ""permission"". 

The story was that a Junior (let's call her A), that my brother has only spoken to once, had a mutual friend (let's call her B). A was distraught, understandably so, and asked B for help with finding a new place. B decides to offer up my brother's apartment, because we own the place. 

My partner and I saw this and since we were out, I replied saying ""We'll discuss when we get home.""

When we reached home, turns out he had some friends over for a LAN party, so my partner and I just decided that, we can discuss it on Saturday morning, so we decided not to interrupt his gaming session. Turns out that he had a flight at 10 am the next morning back to our home country (yes, we knew he was heading back, but he never gave us the specific dates.).I had woken up late, and didn't realise that he had already left. I was later informed by his GF that she was asked to hand A the keys to our place, and I lost my shit. 

My reasoning was this

* He never asked everyone else who was living in the apartment
* 6 weeks seems excessive to get your shit together to find a new place
* This was a stranger to me
* This was essentially a stranger to my brother as well since he's only spoken to her, literally once in his life
* Who does B think she is to offer up someone else's house for this?
* A was STILL going back to her home country, instead of settling her own shit here
* International students here are generally quite well off (people from my home country generally are as well), why must she mooch off our place and make me and my SO uncomfortable, instead of renting on AirBNB or a motel nearby?

I texted by brother and basically tore into him about his lack of consideration for the rest of the people in the house. My SO is generally very polite and is afraid of coming off as entitled, so he did not say anything as he felt like it was not his place. 

My brother's line of logic was that

* It was his friend (really? he texted me ""actually, IDK her very well"" after I asked who she was)
* He's being kind 
* It's hard to say no
* Why would I want to kick someone while they're down. 
* He was going to be away anyway, so the house wouldn't be too crowded

I told him that if he didn't want to say no to her, I'd do it and I asked for her number. After sending her number to me, he refuses to reply my texts or my phone calls. He probably thinks I'm some cold blooded monster.

Backstory: I have been with this small company for over 10 years, and occasionally we plan social events after work. The latest plan is to invite a speaker and host a dinner where the people planning will have to do the cooking for the event. Planning for this started 2 months ago, and 4 of us volunteered to do the cooking. 

Story: A month passed from the initial meeting to plan the even passed, and barely any communication or actual planning happened. During that time I was transferred to different department where I have to work more hours and because of that can no longer help with cooking for the event as my new schedule conflicts with the date of the event. The event is now in a few days, and the person in charge of the food now asked if I can help with the shopping for groceries for the dinner. I agreed and gave the date where I can help, but afterwards the person who asked me to help and was also suppose to help says that they can’t help anymore with the shopping and asked me to do the shopping by myself.

I asked for a grocery list for the supplies and all I got was, “We’re making salad, and pizza,” and got nothing more from that initial conversation. As someone who has organized small eating functions before I knew that this isn’t everything they’ll need. So I had to keep asking more and more questions like how many people will we be feeding, what’s the budget, and knowing that they’ll be using an industrial kitchen, that seasoning stuff and even oil must be bought.

At this point I’m tired of asking any more questions. And will just buy the stuff that was talked about from the above mentioned conversations, but from my past experience planning dinners I know that there’s stuff that’s possibly missing and I am not sure if the people currently planning the event have dealt with, like cutlery, drinks, cups, and so on and so forth.


So my question is WIBTA if at this point I stop asking if they’ll still need, x,y, and z and just buy what we talked about?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

For context to the situation my parents are divorced and earlier that day I was with my mom and some family on her side watching a movie and we were hanging out and stuff and later my mom brought up some stuff about religion and some stuff about how she felt our relationship was strained - which we’ve talked about before but I think the timing of all this might make me an ignorant asshole

So I (15m) was in my room playing games with my friends on Discord until around 11:00 until my older brother (20m) got home and decided to check in on me. He told me that we could go to our dads any time (implying tomorrow) so I decided to jokingly say “well how about right now?” And he said okay. I was surprised at first because I didn’t think he would say that but neither of us were going to go back on our words so we both got our stuff together and let our mom know that we would be going. My brother told her how me and him both saw it- we decided to leave on a whim and she shouldn’t take it personally, and that of course we love her and that this was in no way going to become a ‘regular thing’
When I came in to tell her bye I tried to keep it lighthearted but she seemed very upset. I couldn’t see her face but it sounded like she might have almost been crying- I feel so shitty right now. I really didn’t mean for her to take it personally and I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings- she said she understood this wasn’t a personal thing at all but I really think I fucked up.

So I(21F) recently graduated from college and moved back in with my parents until I can save up enough to move in with my bf. My mom is throwing me a graduation party this weekend which she invited over 50 people to. I don't mind having a party, in fact I'm glad to have an excuse to have my school friends visit and to eat good food and such but 50 is far more than I want to deal with. She insisted in inviting every single person we share blood with and every person in our office even if she knew they wouldn't come. 

Among the invitees is her sister(my aunt) and her family who live about 8 hours away. I was just informed that all four of them are coming and neither the guest bedroom nor the bed in my brother's old room are big enough for my aunt and her husband (they are both over 6' and a bit heavy set), therefore they will be sleeping in my bed which is a queen. I am EXTREMELY uncomfortable with this. This is still my room for at least another year and I am not okay with just letting other people into my personal space to sleep in my bed. Additionally, I really don't like kids and theirs are 11 and 8(? I don't actually know but he's single digits and in school) as well as extremely poorly behaved and if these kids' parents are in my room they are going to end up in there as well one way or another and I want my room to be completely kid free at all costs. 

I'd honestly rather not have a party at all than have my personal space just offered up like this without my consent (canceling is not an option, it's in 4 days and everything is paid for). 

My mother told me I can sleep in the guest room but the thought of being down the hall while my aunt and her husband are in my room, in my bed behind a closed door turns my stomach (not that I think they'll have sex in my bed, it's unrelated to that). I told her that if she's insisting on giving my room away I'll stay with my bf which she isn't happy about but I really don't give a shit as we are both adults. Not that I particularly want to because his bed is super uncomfortable but it's better than staying in my guest room. AITA for being so resistant to this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwybyx	2019-06-05 04:05:36	Chocolatejellyfish1	AITA for not wanting my grandfather to pay for my university fees	"So I live in Australia and am in my second year of University, my grandfather came to me recently and said that he wanted to contribute to my university fees, and in Australia it works like this 

You don't pay the fees straight away if you are an Australian citizen they go into an interest free hex loan until you earn over a certain amount about $50k 

I thanked him a lot and said I would try and set up a way for him to contribute cause thats what my parents wanted me to do, but I don't want his help for several reasons, 
1) I'm hiding a secret, I failed two of my classes last year and no member of my family knows, I'm worried that he will look at the amount my hex debt is and figure it out,
2) I'm worried that he will feel that he has a right to see my grades and know everything that is going on with my uni, and that's my information some things I don't want to share
3) when I chose my uni based on my atar he was disappointed and said that he wouldn't help me pay for uni because of my marks and the uni I'm going to, I felt really betrayed after that considering that I am the first in my family to go to uni and he's gone from wanting to pay to not wanting to pay to wanting to pay again
4) I have a horrible theory about why he wants to pay now, my sister will be starting uni soon and she is doing very well at her VCE I have a feeling that the only reason that my grandfather asked to pay is so he can contribute to my sister's fees and not make me feel left out 

There's no real way I can turn his offer down but I still don't want his help with this so AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwyaag	2019-06-05 04:00:21	aremel04	WIBTA if I didn't invite my parents to my wedding?	"Mobile. I started this at 3am because I couldn't sleep. I get up for work in 2 hours. Enjoy.

I've (27F) been in a relationship with my partner (27F) for over 6 years and we're currently buying a house together i.e it's hecking serious. 

My parents have an inkling of my relationship but I have not confirmed or plan to talk to them about it. I don't feel obligated to for reasons below. My partner respects my decision. 

My parents are Asian and Catholic. You know the type, picking and choosing whatever part of the bible to suit their agenda (casual homophobia and racism), only goes to church once a year, but they did place my siblings and I in Catholic schools. 

They're not extreme, they're pleasant if you meet them and have friends that are gay and of other races. 

From a young age, my mother has physically and mentally abused me. Maybe I was a particularly shitty child and for a while, I did think this. Growing older, I recognised she was just an unhappy woman in an unhappy marriage, in a country that made her unhappy. Since I was a tomboy growing up, she looked at me as a defect and took her rage out on me, compared to my other siblings. 

My father, absent with work, defended me at first but eventually took my mother's side as I never spoke to him about my abuse. My mother would hide whenever she hit me, even praising me if I lied to him about where my bruises came from. My childhood was fucked up. 


I acknowledge that they've worked hard to provide us a life in the Western world and I'm fortunate to have the opportunities I have now because of them. Although, I worked hard so I could move away from home. 
As a female, it was expected I would remain in the house until marriage (to a man, ha) and it was a huge blow to my mother when I managed to get into a good university away from home. 

I've been independent from them since 18. My father dropped me off my uni halls with a luggage filled with clothes and that was it. I borrowed money from my bank and scraped by with government loans until I got my first job 3 years later. 

I played the good Asian child and gave money to my parents when I got said job, but stopped after I realised I was only getting invited to family outings because I paid for them. 

I now live my own life and I have a civil but tense  relationship with them. 

My older brother has cut contact with them completely for the past 7 years. Maybe that'll give insight. 

I am asking if IWBTA is because the last major argument that happened between us was 4 years ago. They're still my parents and I would like them to be present in my life events, but not so much that telling them about my partner will open another rift in our relationship.

My mother, especially, lives a life in delusion and thinks she has been a saint of a mother.
Our last 3 major arguments has been trying to get her to admit what a shitbag she has been, but no sauce there! 

They'll be hurt to find they haven't been invited to their child's wedding.
