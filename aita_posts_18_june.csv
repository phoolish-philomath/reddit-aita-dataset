c2c7ja	2019-06-19 03:55:49	alt1throwaway	AITA for Questioning my Boyfriend's New Drinking Habits?	"My boyfriend \[18M\] and I \[17F\] have been dating for almost 2 years now. He is a senior in high school and I am a junior. He began drinking alcohol recently, and I don't view him the same anymore. He is always safe, and doesn't drink much, but I have never drank and I don't like the thought of it. I don't plan on drinking anytime soon, and I almost cry every time I think about how he's changed. I feel bad telling him how feel because it just makes him feel worse about what he's done. However, he insists that I should be honest with him. He is going to college next fall and will probably be drinking there, which again, I don't like the thought of. We've discussed it and don't know how to proceed. Am I being stupid, or should he stop drinking?

c2c7dt	2019-06-19 03:55:22	ghostinyourpants	WIBTA for blowing off a lonely friend on Mat Leave	"I was good friends with a coworker, or so I thought. We hung out outside of work about once a month, and I considered her one of my close friends.

When she started planning her wedding, I was the first person she told - both at work and among her friends, and then, she asked for my help designing the wedding invitations, which I happily gave. 

Then, I never got one. Wasn't invited to the bachelorette or the wedding. She continued to ask for wedding planning advice at work on our breaks, and I was there, but my feelings were incredibly hurt. I don't think she ever realized how heartbroken I was. She had plenty of girlfriends she was close to, but I've always struggled making friends and being left out hurt me deeply.

I was also extremely embarrassed about being so hurt and so obviously misjudging where we were at friendship-wise, so I never said anything, and instead just quietly pulled back emotionally, and made efforts to put my energy into other friendships. 

After the wedding, (when she went to excitedly show me wedding pictures) she awkwardly apologized about it, saying that she didn't want to open the can of worms about inviting work buds and only close friends and family were able to come, which I totally understand. 

Since then, we've only talked at events that we happen to run into each other at, and I've kept my distance, which has been fine, and to be honest, I don't think she even noticed the difference. Which is also fine. I'm the one who misjudged things and chose not to say anything.


Fast forward a few years:
She's currently on maternity leave and keeps inviting me over to her house for hang outs in the afternoon, since I have odd morning hours at my new job and most other people she knows works office hours. She's mentioned a number of times about being really lonely and missing being friends with people who aren't moms. She keeps sending me super cute pictures of her kid in the outfit I got him at the office baby shower and wanting to spend time with me. I feel like a giant asshole for continuing to brush her off, but I also feel like I'm pretty emotionally vulnerable, especially with her (I still cry when I think about the situation) - and I'm just not good at casual friendships. I also don't want to ever feel like I'm at someone's beck and call when they're bored, and other, cooler people, aren't available, either. 

So, while I feel like a big jerk to continually avoid the situation, I also feel like I'd be a total weirdo for explaining the - literally years old - reason for keeping my distance now. But I also am not able to look at this situation objectively, without getting emotional. 

So.

I was friends with this guy. We tried to date. It didn’t work. He was overbearing, judged me heavily for my past sex life (my body count is <10 and I haven’t even done anything crazy. Not like that should matter at all regardless), and just generally made me feel shitty about myself. It was like I could never do anything right - never communicated enough, never was affectionate enough, never available enough, even with legit reasons for my “”short comings”” and attempts at solutions or compromises. My point with this is that we did NOT work as a couple and he made me feel nuts. I also am bringing this up to illustrate that we were *constantly* having these big sit-down talks to discuss our issues and try to work through them. It was like every other day some times! It exhausted me. 

However, we made good friends because there were no expectations of affection or consistent communication, and we got along great when romance wasn’t on the table. We had the same humor,  enjoyed each other’s company...all good. For a little while. After a few months of a happy platonic relationship, things started getting rocky. His expectations for communication were obviously still there, he just hid them for a while. He also had some feelings still that were unrequited on my end. It caused more problems and we had to have the **talks** again. I wanted things to work out as friends bc he was a good friend and a genuinely sweet guy who seemed to care for me a lot. And I did too, I wanted nothing more than for him to be happy, and he appeared to be going through a rough time with his private life. He also doesn’t have many friends. So I did want to try and resolve stuff bc I didn’t want to leave him hanging in that situation, and bc he was so nice to me (besides being a shit bf). 

Eventually after another argument, I couldn’t take it & just stopped answering, stopped trying to hang out. He never tried to reach out either. I haven’t seen him in a few weeks now, no contact whatsoever. And now I’m wondering if I was an asshole for what I did. I knew if I said “this isn’t working out” it would just result in ANOTHER talk where I lose my spine bc I’m exhausted and I give into his attempts at reconciliation. But I did leave him with only 1 or 2 other friends to go to, and friends is a strong word. 

There’s a little more to this than I could fit, so feel free to ask for more info"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2c552	2019-06-19 03:48:40	sigismunda	WIBTA for telling my friend they aren’t a good friend	So basically, I’m a really giving person, this sounds like I’m bragging but I’m not trying to. Friends and Family always receive gifts I collect over the month/year that I saw and thought ‘so and so would like that’ and I do like giving presents, it makes me feel happy. But I feel like I always attract people who take advantage of this fact. I got into a fight with a former friend over the fact that they always said they agreed with what I said then when pressed about it immediately backtracked. Now this friend, we’ll call him C has been my friend for 2 years and although I love getting gifts for him I feel like he takes it and gives nothing back which makes me feel like we’re not as close as I thought. My roommate is having his gf over this Saturday and I asked C if I could just stay the night at his place and he didn’t say yes or no he just kind of dropped the subject. But I feel like this is a recurring theme, I never ask anything of him but when I do he always makes me feel like I asked for too much. He comes over often and I always cook for everyone, I’ve made him birthday cakes and paid for his food when we go out when money’s tight for him but then when he asks if I want to get food and I say money’s tight he just goes “damn alright, another time then” and goes without me. Like I don’t want it to be transactional but I feel like I treat him better than he treats me and I don’t know if I should confront him about it.

c2c4vz	2019-06-19 03:47:54	lydiebug140	AITA for borrowing a pad?	"So my aunt has her best friend living with her at her house and they're both nearing 60. In the past I had used her electric razor for something and left it in the other room. She yelled at me and said I stole her things and I didn't. A couple days after that a 99 cent bottle of polish remover and a bottle of nail polish went missing. She is POSITIVE im the one responsible and I swear I didn't touch them. It wasn't anyone else in the house because the only girls are her and my aunt. I think she misplaced them but she is certain I'm the one to blame. 

I was over there with my bf to use the internet and play video games when I had to use the restroom. I went in and saw the me period had started. Great. I knew the friend had kept little pads in the medicine cabinet and I was gonna use one. There was only one in there and I didn't ask because 1. I'm bleeding and 2. She isn't home. I couldn't call her because she blocked my number and I couldn't go back down stairs because reason 1. I grabbed it and used it, figuring she had more in her room which she kept locked. I later found out from my mom on the drive home that she had ranted to my aunt about it and my aunt told my mom. Apparently they aren't pads, and they're just used to catch... Leaks. I didn't know this and I was wondering why she didn't say it to my face. 

When we went back a couple days later I saw her going into her room and went to apologize. She said in this snotty tone ""well next time you shouldn't be touching my things"" All with a face smile on. I apologized again and said she wasn't home and I didn't know what to do. She continued to tell me not to touch her stuff and this went back and forth a bit until she shut her door and I walked away. My aunt later called me downstairs to say she told her that she wasn't accepting anything because I sound fake and she knows I don't mean it.... Am I the asshole here?


Edit: I gave her money to buy more

c2c4mt	2019-06-19 03:47:03	Danielbegew882	AITA for not wanting to replace furniture I bought with an ex because my girlfriend is upset and wants brand new sets?	"Well the title basically says it all. 

In 2012 I bought a small house and my gf at that time helped me furnish it. She worked for a big upscale furtniture company so she got me some pretty good discounts on otherwise very expensive, luxury furniture. Things like couch, dining table, bedroom set were all stuff I bought using her discounts. 

We broke up in 2014 but stayed on good terms though we haven’t spoken since 2015 or so. My current girlfriend and I started dating in 2017. She knew about my ex and how we split on good terms and was slightly upset about it (she is on extremely bad terms with all her exes) because she thinks it means I’m not “truly over this ex if I don’t hate her.” But that’s a whole other issue.

Anyways she’s moving in with me in a few months. I tell her she’s free to decorate as she wishes since it’ll be her home too, so she drops a bomb on me. She wants me to throw away or donate ALL the furniture that I had gotten while I was with my ex. This means I’d have to throw away 70% of all the furniture in my house. I tell her no, I’m not throwing away perfectly good furniture and she accuses me of not letting her feel at home. She wants me to throw away all my good furniture and replace it with cheaper, flimsier things from IKEA (since we wouldn’t be able to afford the expensive stuff without discounts).

I just think it’s an absolute waste to throw away all that furniture. My gf thinks we should start “anew” which means nothing left over from my ex days. Even things as small as a coffee table would need to go. Granted she has offered to chip in on the new furniture but I just genuinely don’t want to downgrade from my current stuff to cheap IKEA stuff which would look worse as well. 

This has caused a huge fight and she accuses me of going back on my promise of letting her decorate. I meant she’s free to paint the walls, put up pictures, rearrange, buy new things, etc. not gut my existing home. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

He has a very pretty gf, but I respected the fact that she was his gf. Well she picked on me for being late, as I showed up like 15 minutes late to the place we met. I mentioned I had just finished getting a piercing and it took a bit longer than I thought. That got us chatting, and we had a really good convo that included my friend as well. I thought it was a good time.

The conversation was about the piercing I got, which was a genital piercing, and she had never heard of someone getting that so she had lots of questions. I asked if she had any piercings and she told me she had nipple piercings. I thought the conversation was all very nonsexual, just discussing the piercings we had and she asked me some questions about mine.

After words I sent him a text that said this verbatim ""hey man, great meeting your girl. She seems really cool and she is very pretty. Seems like a great catch, it was good seeing you both have fun tonight"".

He accused me of flirting with her and trying to steal her from him. I genuinely don't even know how to respond, I didnt think I was flirting at all. 

AITA? It all seemed super out of left field but I may not see his perspective.


EDIT: I just want to make it clear that I didnt waltz in and say hey friends gf guess what? I got my dick pierced! I said something to the effect of ""sorry I was at xyz took a bit longer than I thought"" and she asked what I had done. If she wasn't interested in knowing what I had done she shouldn't have asked in my opinion.

EDIT 2: Just an update, I text him and apologized if he perceived it that way and I wasn't trying to cause any issues. He admitted he was jealous because we clicked pretty well. I told him I had no interest in his gf, and that I thought it was a good thing because it means we can hang out in the future and everyone would get along. All is well, just a small spat between friends. Thanks for all your input

EDIT 3: Apparently I have to explicitly state this for the people who read into every minuscule detail: she knew genital piercings existed. When I said she had never heard of a guy getting one I meant she had never met someone with one so she was curious. Do you know someone in your life with a genital piercing? Most likely not, if you do that's cool too."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2c2ra	2019-06-19 03:41:31	doubleDpressed	AITA for asking my dad to help pay for my kittens medical bills instead of a gift if he was planning on getting me anything	"So background: my (18F) dad (60M) hasn’t really been in my life for the majority of it. It’s a long story but basically he left me with my abusive crack addict mother and never looked back until recently. He says things like “I only hit your mother when she deserved it” and “I know it was hard for you but it was harder for me” so not a good relationship

Two months ago he bought me a kitten as one of his “I’m a shit father but I’m buying you things to feel better about myself” gifts. I love this cat (named Honey) with all my heart even though I’ve only known him for two months. 

Today the vet told me I would need to get a heart ultrasound for Honey because he has a 3/6 heart murmur that’s not going away. The ultrasound would tell us what’s going on and get a prognosis. The vet said that since he seems otherwise healthy and shows no symptoms of being a sick cat that the chances are this is something he can live with. The ultrasound is going to cost around $500.

I tell my dad this and I don’t expect him to pay, I’m fully prepared to save up and get it by myself. I mention that chances are he will be fine and live a long healthy life but we can’t put him under for neutering until we know for sure. This is where I fucked up. I expected some emotional support (which my dad has never given me before) and that’s not what I got.

He told me I should call the people we got him from and demand a new cat when (not if WHEN) he dies. He also talks about “what a waste of money” the cat was, which horrified me. This entire time he was essentially ignoring me and looking for birds (??) with binoculars. My birthday is in a week so I said “if you’re planning on buying me any object for my birthday, which I don’t expect because you got me the cat, I would rather have a contribution towards medical bills” this is when he lost it and got mad at me for “demanding money” and I got angry and said “if you fucking listened to me instead of searching for birds you would fucking know I already said I don’t expect anything but if you were planning something I don’t want anything of monetary value” and he called me an asshole for “not respecting my parents.”

Looking back I probably shouldn’t have mentioned it that way but this man throws money around all the time for birthdays. He bought me a $1500 laptop in tenth grade when I just wanted a cheap one. I think I may have came off as an entitled ungrateful shit but I’m not sure. Basically am I the asshole for mentioning I would rather have vet bills helped with over birthday gifts and am I the asshole for getting angry and using some not to nice language?

Tldr: dad buys me kitten, kitten possibly has heart condition, I tell my dad to not buy me anything for my birthday but if he wants to get me something contribute financially, he calls me an asshole for asking for money, I am possibly an asshole for asking for money

c2c2bv	2019-06-19 03:40:10	throaway44559999	AITA for wanting to sue for custody of my daughter?	"I have been married for 25 years to an amazing woman. We have four sons. Back when we just had our oldest two about 16 years ago, we hit a rough patch and legally separated for a bit. We honestly thought it was heading to divorce. During this time, I entered a short-term relationship with a woman we’ll call Miranda. It wasn’t anything terribly serious and I regret that I didn’t tell her that I was married or any of that. I was younger and a much different person at the time. Doesn’t make it right, I know. Anyway, we did sleep together during this time. Eventually, my wife and I reconnected. I was honest that I had been in a sexual relationship, but we worked past that. Miranda and I broke it off and I didn’t hear from her. She didn’t seem overly upset when I explained the situation, but I wasn’t stupid and knew I looked like an ass. I went to therapy with my wife, our marriage has been stronger than ever and we had our two other sons. I nearly forgot all about Miranda all together.

Fast forward to now. I started hearing from a few people that Miranda had a daughter. I didn’t think much of it, until I heard the age. I spied on Miranda’s Facebook page and she looks a lot like two of my sons (who I have been told are clones of myself). I noticed that in this time, Miranda has remarried, though she did that when her daughter was 5. I decided to contact her and she asked if we could meet. 

She was honest and told me that her daughter was mine. She felt like my situation was so complicated and she worried about ruining my marriage and possibly losing the baby to us (which we never would’ve done). Miranda explained that she had the baby alone, then a few years later met her husband. Her daughter is aware that her step-father is not her bio dad, but she considers him her father.

I was pissed, hurt and a fury of emotions. I did ask for a DNA test and she complied, this is my child. I explained the situation to my wife and sons, they’re taking it a lot better than I expected. 

The only issue is my daughter. She has no interest in getting to know me or my family. We met once, just us, and it was awkward of course. I wanted it to be slow and I said I get I’m not “dad”, but I want to be something. She turned me down. I don’t blame her here, but I do blame her mother and I told her I will be pursuing custody, because I wouldn’t be in this situation if she had just told me. Miranda told me that I am partially why we are here.

My wife thinks that’s a mistake and I need to let my daughter come to me. She said it sucks, but this will cause resentment. I still want to get to know my flesh and blood. Now, I have the step-dad trying to reach out to make peace and I told him he could talk to my lawyer.

c2c1wv	2019-06-19 03:38:55	DeanOfTheGreen	WIBTA if I told my best friend she's not being a good friend?	"About a month ago, our relationship took a bit of a dip because of finals stress. It was a really rough three weeks for both of us - I was in a deep depressive funk the entire time, and she was struggling with impostor syndrome and other insecurities on top of one of the worst workloads I've ever seen, even for an institution like ours.

Even in my depressive episode, I took the time to take care of her. I held her as she stress-cried, proofread and edited her final paper, and bought her snacks to help her cope. This level of labor is normal for me; I take care of my friends to the best of my ability, and I actually find that helps me cope with my own health. My issue is that while I was doing these things for her, she wasn't putting the same effort into taking care of me. 

I was very open with her about my depression during that time, and there were a few days where she would come home to me sobbing on my bed (we roomed together this past semester). She'd come over for a little while, but never for long, and would retreat into her room to sleep as I was breaking down next door. She would never bring it up the next morning, nor would she check in at all.

About a week after finals was over, I wrote her a letter explaining that I felt neglected and apologized for my behavior. She accepted it, explaining that she just needed a lot more rest than I did and that that was her priority.

It's been about two weeks since then, and now that it's summer, we both have a lot more time on our hands. I've noticed that she still doesn't seem interested in listening to my problems. I can't even remember a time since summer began that she's checked in on me - I've always initiated it.

Case in point: She met this boy on a dating app recently, and is anxious about seeing him. We've had multiple long conversations where she expressed her fears and I did my best to assuage them. At the end of one such conversation, I told her I haven't been feeling well the past week or so. She never replied, and still hasn't.

There are other instances where she has done similar things, and I'm starting to feel really frustrated. I understand that she doesn't prioritize others as much as I do - I respect that, and I think that self-care and knowing your boundaries is important. But it's starting to feel like she's using her need for space as a cop-out. She's totally fine taking up my space, but as soon as I try to take up some of hers she pulls the tired card. 

I love her and I want to respect her need for space, but if we're going to continue being best friends I need to know that I can rely on her. Not being able to open up to her sucks, and it's been affecting my mental health again. I've been in multiple toxic relationships before, and this is starting to feel like one. But maybe I'm just more sensitive to that because I've had experience in those types of relationships. I don't know.

Without going into a lot of detail, I've kind of realized over the past year that she's extremely hypocritical and has made me feel horrible about myself. I've always had self esteem issues, but every time I'd do anything she didn't like or disagreed with her she made me feel horrible about myself, but if I dared criticize anything (which could be trying to argue with me with straight-up incorrect facts or cheating on tests and then proceeding to make fun of me for not doing as well), she'd immediately say that I'm being overly dramatic/sensitive/nitpicky and just generally make me feel bad.

Shes really impacted my self esteem and altogether made me fixate on my flaws so much more than is needed. This isnt to say I'm a good person by any means, but I'm starting to realize I'm not as bad as she makes me feel.

Anyways, for the past few months I've been trying to sever ties with her without confrontation, but it's really not working; she still hangs out with me and my friends and is still belligerent.

c2bzni	2019-06-19 03:32:24	JoJoTaters	AITA for not going to my dad’s wedding?	"My dad gets married in a few weeks. I have decided not to go to the wedding. Reddit: am I the asshole?? On mobile and TLDR at end. 

Some background on me: I’m a mid-level professional who took a pay cut 2 years ago for more upside and a more rewarding job. I’m still not back to my previous 6-figure salary. I was (unhappily) married until about 1.5 years ago. We were both high-earners and travelled a lot. Since my pay cut, I moved out and am on my own. Subsequently, I have a new boy friend and we’re pretty serious. I have a 12-year old son. My midwestern rent isn’t as high as on the coast; but I’m not exactly rolling in the dollars. I cover my bills and have some in savings. 

On my dad: he and my mom were (unhappily) married until I was about 20. They divorced and he’s been single for a long time. About a year ago, he met a very wonderful woman online. They met, fell in love and he moved to where she resides Florida. They’re getting married in Florida. I’m very happy for them. 

Since quitting my higher-paying job 2 years ago, I haven’t been on a proper vacation. Originally, when the wedding was announced, I said I was tentative. I would have to pull from my savings account, with no plans to repay it, for the wedding. Since then, my dad indicated that, prior to the previous offer, I could no longer stay at his house as other out-of-town guests were going to stay there. At that point, I got serious about not attending the wedding and making plans to travel, by car, to a mountain vacation with my boyfriend. 

I’ve had a great month at work, plus my boyfriend’s contribution, will not have to pull from savings for the mountain vacation. I could have taken my portion and fly my son and I to Florida, rent a car and stay 3 days. Same cost for the entire trip I’ve planned via car. 

My dad is very upset I’m not coming. He doesn’t know about the vacation I’ve planned. What’s worse? I accidentally planned the vacation for the exact week his wedding is planned. Yea, I know. Pretty bad right? It really was accidental between work, my schedule, my BF’s schedule and when my son is with his dad. Am I the asshole for choosing my own vacation as opposed to flying across the country to attend his wedding?

c2byn9	2019-06-19 03:29:27	heavvy_metal_cowboy	AITA for expecting money from an insurance claim?	"Alright. As of late I've had some shit luck. I (20F) wrecked my old car and my mother was nice enough to let me use her old car. I don't understand why she's held onto it for so long; she bought her new car three years ago and this old one has been molding in our yard ever since. Nonetheless I'm grateful we still had it around! My brother (17) was supposed to get it when he got his license, but because I also needed a car, the two of us were sharing it. In order to get it running, he spent $170 at the mechanic and I spent another $80 getting it tagged & $120 on an alternator, and $100 on a new battery. My lovely friend & I put in 5 hours getting it running. My brother and I paid for all gas and the insurance. My mother has done nothing for that car in years.

Fast forward a month: the car gets rear ended when my brother is headed to a friend's. It's the other parties fault; the car is totaled. Insurance offers my mother $2100. She's going to give us back the money we put in it, but my brother and I think that since we had done all the maintenance to it, we should get it. I should mention that my father was previously the one who bought new tires, a new radiator, changed the oil, and did all the maintenance for the entire life of the car up until now and he also argues that we should get the money. 

As I mentioned previously, life has been unkind to me as of late. I could link my r/FML post here if y'all are curious. $1,050 could go a really long way towards getting me back on my feet. I have no way of getting to work and I really can't afford to lose my job. My mom is fully aware of my situation. And while I understand it was technically her car, she hasn't touched it in years.

c2byn5	2019-06-19 03:29:27		AITA For Wanting My Parents to Pay for My Clothes	I (f/17) have recently gotten back in to horseback riding and after about 2 months of wearing the one pair of riding pants I have left that still fit, I asked my mom if I could buy a couple more pairs ($35-$50 each for cheap but durable ones). She said  if you need an answer right now, the answer is no, use your own money, so I just left it alone for a while. I waited a couple more months and asked again and got the same answer, but when I asked for a reason for it she said that it was because I need to learn the value of money. She said I need to start paying for my own clothes and gas money because it’ll help me learn to budget. I partially agree with her on that, because I have been pretty sheltered and my family is fairly well off. However, I have had jobs the past 3 summers and I pay for books, my phone, and sometimes food when I go out to eat with friends. I feel like it is good for my parents to have me pay for things I don’t need as it has helped me learn to budget, but expecting me to buy my own clothes seems excessive. I told her that, and my dad and sister actually agreed with me, but she got defensive and shot down everyone’s objections. I tried to compromise by agreeing to contribute more to gas money, but I work part time at a fast food restaurant, and when school starts again in the fall I won’t have any source of income, so I don’t think I can realistically afford to pay for my own clothes. The argument escalated until she yelled “I am the parent and you are the child, and this is not a democracy” and I got angry and started crying and eventually gave up and left. I am grateful that my parents pay for me to participate in extracurricular activities and I appreciate how hard they work, but I still feel like I shouldn’t have to buy my own clothes. I would really appreciate any insight anyone has into the situation.		1	0

c2bxof	2019-06-19 03:26:39		AITA if I physically move my friends animal who bit me?	"For context, I want to add a couple things because this has really got me anxious about myself. I just left this particular situation I was in. Basically, my friend invited me over and I rode my bike the 5 miles to get there and within 10 minutes of me getting there my friend yelled at me to leave. This is also after they sent me a text earlier in the day saying ""I kinda miss you"" (their way of telling me they really miss me). So maybe I am just jaded, bitter, and altered about this whole situation to the point of not having clear judgement, but I legitimately believe I didn't do anything wrong. Maybe you guys can help me find where I went wrong.

1. The animal bit me on the hand.
2. I was sitting in a chair on my phone minding my own business.
3. The bite wasn't enough to puncture my skin but it left marks and I definitely have bruising on my knuckles and it was enough to make me verbally yelp.
4. I didn't include this in the title because I didn't want people to automatically assume the worst, but I used the bottom of my foot to push the animal away, not gently, but not with enough force to hurt it.
5. My friend immediately freaked out and literally called me an ass hole and told me how I was wrong for ""kicking"" the animal and that it was completely my fault for provoking the animal even though I was literally just sitting in a chair on my phone. I told them that it's not my responsibility to train their animal not to bite, that I didn't kick the animal and instead ""moved it from biting distance"", and how their way of thinking was ""stupid as fuck"".

I admit I got pretty upset. I have literally never experienced this before. I would have been understanding and way less mad if they had just said ""sorry I'll work with him on it"" or something along those lines, but all I felt was that I was met with was hostility and how I was wrong for their animal biting me.

I don't have an animal right this second, but I have had animals in the past and that's always something my parents taught me to do is to take care of the animal through responsibility. I know if it were my pet I would never blame a human if they truly didn't provoke the animal, because it's my responsibility to train the animal and no one else.

So hey reddit, I know how much you love animals...me too. Don't go easy on me...AITA?

**TLDR; My friends animal bit me on the hand while I was sitting in a chair minding my own business. I moved it away with my foot. AITA?**"		1	0

From what I’ve been told, they talk a lot over social media and have shared........ personal photos *wink*. 

Last weekend she went to his city to visit a friend (not the mutual friend). He said he was free previously but when she asked him to meet up he said he was busy and his parents wouldn’t let him. She said “Am I not worth it?” and he (rightfully, in my opinion) got mad about that and said she doesn’t respect his parents (in her defence, English isn’t her first language so maybe she didn’t realize how bad that was). 
And today she asked him if they wanted to meet at a drive in movie which is half way between their cities (20 minutes ish both ways) but again he said he was busy.

She also got Tinder recently “for fun” and matched with someone (J). I told her to meet up  with J but she said no because it wasn’t fair to T.

In the end I told her she was leading on J since it sounded like she was never going to meet up with him anyways, I also told her she should break it off or just be friends with T because he’s probably not as interested as she thinks and she got mad at me.

c2bul9	2019-06-19 03:17:28	CrucifyingAssholes	[META] Crucifying Assholes makes you an Asshole too!	"Now that this sub has gotten popular, there is a larger number of toxic comments here, and I want to say this clearly: CRUCIFYING ASSHOLES MAKES YOU AN ASSHOLE TOO.

Yes, there are posts here where some people are clearly assholes, and they need to be notified as such. But there are a few ways that people are typically replying to these assholes:

1) (The best way) A person comments YTA and provides a breakdown of how the other person (or people) is experiencing the issue, making it much easier for the asshole to logically cope with the situation and accept the truth. This is the most objective way to help assholes understand how they were assholes in the situation and show them a better way of NOT being an asshole.

2) (A subjective but still better way) A person comments YTA and shares their own experience/perspective on the situation. The person might give a few emotionally worded lines in this response, but it's driven by their desire to help the asshole understand that they're an asshole in the situation. It subjectively helps assholes empathize with the truth of the situation and work towards fixing their mistakes. 

3) (THIS WAY MAKES YOU AN ASSHOLE) A person comments YTA and treats the asshole like they're human garbage. Brace yourselves, because I'm going to discuss a lot about method #3:

The person will tell the asshole how they're complete garbage for what they're doing in a very emotionally fueled way. This way is usually getting lots of upvotes and probably gilded. But here's the problem with this: When the ""asshole"" responds to this comment (or even other ones in the thread), regardless of whether the response is flat out disagreement (or just responses that show that they're not getting the message), then people start commenting shit like ""This is why your SO is a saint for being with you and should've left you a long time ago"" or ""I'm not surprised that a piece of shit like you would respond that way"" or ""You don't deserve to be a parent and I hope your kids get taken away"", etc.

This is EXTREMELY hypocritical! You're taking ONE post on reddit about ONE situation and blowing that up to generalize someone that is an asshole in this situation? Yes, I understand that some people are just inherently assholes, but that's not always the case here!

I agree that the majority of the time that people are being assholes that they should be informed as such, but not in a way that treats them like they should be miserable for the rest of their lives.

This type of behavior is demanding perfection or assuming that the person is ALWAYS an asshole. And DMing them disgusting and vile things, and acting like they're the pinnacles of perfection themselves only makes it worse.

**PSA: THIS SUBREDDIT IS ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE BEING ASSHOLES AND HELP THEM IMPROVE, NOT TREATING THEM LIKE SHIT AND TELLING THEM TO KILL THEMSELVES AND MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THIS FUCKING PLANET**

To all of you that immediately decide to write an emotional + rage-induced comment to someone's post because of what you've read without giving someone the benefit of the doubt, I want you to think about your own life and the mistakes that you've made. I want you to think about the times that you've TRULY messed up. How would YOU feel if an army of people on reddit started telling you to kill yourself and talked down to you in such a disgusting way that is meant to sting? It sucks, doesn't it?

And that's the point. I'm willing to bet that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU are assholes at some point in your life, so stop demanding perfection out of every asshole that posts on here. This is what turns people off from here to ask advice and makes them nervous about the impact on their mental health.

And MOST importantly: JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS AN ASSHOLE IN THE SITUATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE AN ASSHOLE ALL THE TIME. People make mistakes! You, me, all of us! It's part of being human!

The whole point of this community is to help each other become better people. And I know many of you are going to say ""the internet is a tough place"" or ""there's always toxic people on reddit"", but that doesn't mean that this behavior is justified. 

Just because one of the windows in my house gets broken doesn't mean that I'm going to leave it that way or beat the shit out of it for being broken until my hands are bloody. I'm going to see what caused the break, fix the window, and take measures to help make sure that the window doesn't get broken again.

We need to help the assholes, not crucify them. That's how we help them turn into better people (and in many cases ourselves too).

EDIT: Holy cow, I have to admit that from the start, you all have been really awesome and provided valuable input! I want to give a huge thanks to the mods for the effort they put in helping me trim this down and convert it to a more constructive post. I'll admit my own fault of being emotionally driven in parts of this post, and I had great feedback from them on how to fix this to make it better and make the message stand out more. I'm glad to hear that I'm not the only one that has felt this way, and I'm sorry to those of you that wanted to make posts like this but were afraid of being treated as a callout. I don't think there's ever just one post like this, there's a common behavior around most of them, and we as people are better than the toxicity that some of us may show at times.

Again, thanks for the feedback, and let's keep on enabling ourselves and others to be better people :)"	META	0	0

Made an alt just so I could post this. 
Hello! 
 
About nine years ago, when I was ten years old, what I like to refer to as “the incident” occurred. My stepbrother, who we’ll refer to as H, was my absolute best friend. He came into my life at a point where I had nobody else to talk to or confide in, and I admired him for that.

 Alas, he had a lot of mental issues I wasn’t aware of spanning back to before I had met him, and one day he pulled a knife on my stepfather, lacerated his arm, and was taken away to a psychiatric hospital in Michigan. It was so mentally scarring that my youngest brother, who was 8 at the time, wound up not being able to sleep at night and eventually even wound up having to go to therapy. 

Well... Flash forward to the present, and my stepbrother’s changed his name, graduated collage, and was actually recently engaged! He reached out to me via Facebook to ask if I’d like to come to the wedding and, seeing as to how I’m old enough and have enough money to go down and attend, I truly don’t see why I shouldn’t go. It’s been years since I talked to him, and last I checked, we weren’t on bad terms? 

However- when I brought this up to my family ( I made sure my younger brother wasn’t around for obvious reasons ), everyone IMMEDIATELY started flipping their shit. They called me disrespectful and advised me not to go to the wedding under any circumstances. Do they think he’d hurt me after nine years of counseling and help? It hadn’t occurred to me that after “the incident” they had cut ties with my stepbrother. ( edit- for clarification, they haven’t completely cut ties, they call on holidays and his birthday. ) 

So, have at me, AITA for wanting to go to his wedding?"		1	0

Mind you we’ve been slightly arguing since then, and it’s slowed down a lot... but definitely still arguing.

As I walk toward her I profusely apologize explaining that the Stalls in the men’s room were occupied. She continues to berate me about how what I’m doing is extremely immoral and I should be fined.

c2bow1	2019-06-19 03:01:15	Jello69	AITA for kicking my husband out of bed in the morning?	"My husband sets his alarm for 5:30 am for work. He is a pretty deep sleeper, I am a light sleeper, so when the alarm goes off I usually wake up first. We share our bedroom currently with our 2 month old son (he is in a crib across the room). 

Sometimes my husband is not very quick to silence his alarm (but he thinks he is.), and its also set to be very loud so that he doesn't miss it. For instance this morning when it went off, I had time to wake up, grab my phone in confusion, panic swipe at the screen a few times (I thought it was my alarm), set my phone down, and then nudge my husband with my foot to get him to turn it off before it woke up the baby. 

When he woke up he yelled (literally, yelled.) ""Its only been a few seconds!!"" and I angry whispered ""shut up!"" at him (which is an asshole thing to say, I apologized to him already.)  

He also has a habit of hitting snooze 2 or 3 times, so we repeat this (me waking up, nudging him to get up or turn the alarm off, him being grumpy at me) several times, every morning. 

Anyways to the point- he is upset that I kick him out of bed. A few mornings ago I got really fed up and stopped letting him snooze (everyone he fell asleep I shook him awake again). I also started slowly pushing him out of the bed lol.  I feel like if he needs to sleep 10 mins more he should set him alarm 10 mins later then. 

Before baby I did not really care, but since I do 100% of the feedings and night wakings, sleep is very precious to me. I don't get to go to bed until after 11pm, and my husband often goes to bed at 8 or 9. And day sleeping when your baby sleeps to catch up is a myth; unless you can ignore the never ending dishes/laundry/groceryshopping/everything else that needs to get done. So basically if the baby wakes up early I get to be a sleep deprived zombie. This will be solved once we move him to his own room but we aren't ready for that yet. 

So- AITA for pushing my husband out of bed in the mornings?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My Husband and I live in San Francisco, and recently made a drive to Las Vegas to visit my Brother and his family, as we havent seen them in about 2 years and they recently had a baby, who was now 4 months old. 

We drove to visit, around 10 hours, and the plan was for us to stay about 4 days, 3 nights with them at their place, arriving late into the night on the first day. Since everything was dark outside and the baby was asleep, we gave hugs, said hi to my brother and his wife, blew up the airmattress and knocked out. Then came morning. 

Much to our surprise, their trailer was a MESS. There wasn't a clean spot in the entire place, with everything covered in what seemed to be a layer of cooking grease. My husband and I were taken aback, but tried to consider that having a baby does take its toll on keeping a house clean, so we simply moved things around and offered to help tidy up as they were nice enough to let us stay. 

My SIL declined our help, laughing and saying she is a stay at home mom and had plenty of time to keep things clean, and she would get to it. After spending the day with our neice, they left with SILs parents, leaving us to relax and catch up with the family. The longer we stayed, the worst the house seemed to get, from realizing the animals they kept were locked in cages for up to 8 hours straight without food and water, to finding bugs throughout the house. 

During our entire visit, even though we offered once more, the house was never cleaned, even though bugs were feasting on the highchair my neice sits on, which was covered in food. By day 3 I was starting to feel rather sick, as I have a compromised immune system, and cannot be around dust for long periods of time. 

My husband and I thanked my brother and his wife, but ended up cutting the trip short, as I was taking a quick tumble downhill. Once we were home, we found my husbands back covered in a rash, as well as my body inflamed and burning hot. We plan to go to the hospital tomorrow if it doesn't clear up with our current Cortisone cream, though I am currently out of commission.

THE QUESTION. 

My husband and I intend to bring this up to my brother and explain to him that we got sick, and while we appreciate him letting us stay, we are very worried about the living conditions he's in. Particularly, we are worried about our neice being there. Would I be the asshole if we let him know that we are worried, then a month later anonymously report them and ask for a wellfare check to make sure our neice is in safe living conditions?"

c2blan	2019-06-19 02:51:09		WIBTA if I stop a friendship because of how bad I think things are gonna end	"This year i’ve met someone that we’re gonna call Erin. Erin and I are very close friends and i
like her a lot. Erin is a person that have gone through much because of her parents: his
father recently left her to go live in portugal (we’re in paris) and her mother constantly deflect
her frustration on her. Because of that, Erin as a fear of feeling abandoned and any other
end of relation would probably really really hurt her.


At the same time Erin and i met, Erin met another person (that we’re gonna call Pam) and
they also became friends. Because we were in the same class, we always used to hang out
together and things were first going pretty well. And because things were good, Erin got
attached to the situation. But as we were getting to know each other more, Pam and i started
to fight a lot and any party or other would end up in either a fight or Erin would call me
afterward and tell me that Pam told her that she hated how i acted.


It was just gossip at the time but things were getting worse and worse, and neither me or
Pam would stop being aggressive with the other.At the time i didn’t realise how hurtful it was
for Erin because she was present during the fight trying to calm down things and we wouldn’t
listen to her. Erin eventually confessed to me how she felt about the whole thing and i
realised how much of an asshole we were.


I have to mention that when Erin confessed to me about the whole situation with the fighting
she told me that if we had to stop this whole trio things she wouldn’t know what to do
because alternating between the two of us would frustrate her more than anything and
choosing one over another would be impossible. Because clearly we couldn’t get along, i
chose to stop any relation with erin and pam so she wouldn’t have to choose and to end this
whole thing. But like i said at the beginning, Erin is someone who have a real problem with
the feeling of being abandoned and my attempt to do that was sold by her crying for two
hour and me apologizing for doing that and to stay friend with her.


After that, Erin adopted the solution of alternating between the two of us , but this doesn’t
work. Everybody now feel like shit because Erin clearly doesn’t look happy, Pam require a
exclusivity in her relation with Erin that would require my friendship with Erin to end, and i
feel like i’m slowly left away. I don’t know what to do except what i’ve already tried which is to
end all that, because clearly someone as to go or the tree of us will end up hating each
other. But Erin is really an amazing person and i don’t want to hurt her and to stop being
friend with her , and she was put in this situation without doing anything bad, and i know that
if i try to end this again she really will be hurt and i don’t know if i’m being selfish to hurt her
that much to stop feeling shitty about this whole thing. So i’m calling reddit for an opinion:

Lately though, every night between 10 pm and 11 pm, somebody on our block (not sure who, the sound is hard to localize) is either firing guns for fun (illegal in our city) or setting off some loud firecrackers, it's hard to tell the difference. I let it go the one night because I figured it was a one off, but it's been happening every night for about a week now. It's really loud and scary and it can go on for a half hour at a time.

Here's the rub. One, we're new to this neighborhood. Two, we're one of two white families on this block of several black families in a city where the minority population has a notoriously adversarial relationship with the PD. I don't want to be the knucklehead who brings the cops into the neighborhood over a noise complaint and thereafter have a shitty relationship with my neighbors. However, this noise is seriously disturbingly loud and goes on when I'm trying to sleep during the weekdays. So, WIBTA if I call the police?  


EDIT: Just to be clear, I've lived here 2 months and this has just started happening in the last week. Maybe I should talk to some of the neighbors I've met and ask if they know what it's about?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2bjjs	2019-06-19 02:46:13	throwaway4563254	AITA for not allowing my aunt's plus one to my wedding?	"About a year ago, my uncle passed away. My dad was several years older than my uncle, and since my uncle moved in to my dad's house when I was 5 and he was 15, I've always looked to him as an older brother and friend. When he passed away suddenly in September, it was a major shock for our whole family, especially my aunt. Recently, I've gotten engaged and began sending invites around. We're having a low key ceremony at a friend's barn, so the guest list is not necessarily a problem. I sent my aunt an invite, and I got a call from her a few days later. She asked if she could bring a plus one of a new person she recently met. I did not feel comfortable with this, and asked her not to. She then informed me that she was no longer coming because she felt unwanted.

c2bhv0	2019-06-19 02:41:14	memesmadememuslim	AITA for not attending my sister's weddings?	A month ago, my sister was getting married. We're Pakistani, and if you've no familiarity with Pakistani weddings, they tend to be a two-part affair. The *nikkah*, the first part, is typically hosted when the marriage license is signed and generally by the brides family. The *walima*, the second part, is typically hosted about a week or so later by the grooms family. As the brother of the bride, I was expected to play MC for the nikkah and be part of the wedding party at the walima. Two small problems: Pakistani people can some of the most petty, judgmental, miserable sons-of-bitches you'll ever meet (made even worse at weddings and parties), and any gathering larger than about 4 people gives me full-blown panic attacks. Unfortunately, men talking about their problems, especially mental health problems, or even showing emotion is not something that happens in our culture (25 years ago, my uncle cried at his father's funeral, and to this day he is still mocked for it). With all this, I told her I had a work opportunity and wouldn't be able to attend her weddings. She seemed hurt, but understanding, given that she knows I get panic attacks and even talked me down from one before. But when she got back from her honeymoon, she's changed towards me. We used to be very close, but now she's monosyllabic towards me and doesn't take my calls. Was I wrong not to attend, even though I can guarantee I would've had a panic attack and brought great shame to our family (not even joking here, the concept of [*izzat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izzat_\(honour\)) is not something that's taken lightly)?

c2bhsn	2019-06-19 02:41:01	WarmContext	WIBTA for selling two of my children's homes?	"**tl;dr: we own four houses: our own and our three kid's homes. We're going to lose a lawsuit and need to sell. WWBTA for selling two of our kid's homes instead of one, just because the one has children?**

My husband and I (56 and 55) used to be petroleum engineers and retired young at 35. We have three children: 30M, 28F, 27F. We bought each of them houses, but some are worth more than others:

- 30M received a $180,000 home bought in 2010
- 28F received a $130,000 home bought in 2011
- 27F received a $340,000 home bought in 2016

Numbers aren't exact but almost there. Why did our youngest get the most expensive? She at the time was pregnant with our first grandchild and today they have two kids. These are our only grandchildren.

My husband and I are in a lawsuit right now and things are looking dire. We're not at fault but we're against a larger company. I'd say there's maybe a 5% chance of us coming out of this ahead. I don't know if I should get into the details of this as it's irrelevant, but I want to reiterate we're not at fault.

In the chance we lose, we're going to have to pay up a pretty penny. We've already given up hope of winning and are going to sell our house, but this isn't enough. We're thinking of selling 30M and 28F's houses and letting 27F keep hers, even though the first two could stay if we sold the third. We're prioritizing the home in which our grandchildren live.

We've made mention of this to all of our kids and all three incidentally are upset. 27F wants to give up her home for the sake of her siblings but all the houses are in our names solely so we have final decision. Our other two children haven't spoken to us since, and it's been two months.

Are we the assholes for prioritizing one child over our other two, solely because they have children of their own? 30M has expressed zero interest in ever having children, 28F had her tubes tied already and is proudly childfree. This is irrelevant but it shows through 27F that these are the only grandkids we'll ever get.

c2ber9	2019-06-19 02:32:40	Comale0126	WIBTA for telling the cops where to find the motorcycle my cousin stole?	"Final Update:
The Ex showed up with the cops to get the bike this morning and apparently my cousin had already destroyed it a few days before I overheard his conversation. He was planning to leave it in her driveway this weekend. Its completely undrivable now and she is planning to press charges. 

Update at the bottom

Backstory:
My cousin got out of prison in October. He was in for 2 years on theft related charges (I dont remember exactly what they were). He started dating a family friend shortly after his release.

This girl did everything for him. She was always spending all of her money on him. She even helped him get a job with her familys company. She was always buying him gifts including a very expensive motorcycle.

Last month she found out he had been cheating on her for the last few months and had gotten the other girl pregnant, so naturally she broke things off. She turned off his cellphone service, but told him he could keep the phone she bought him. The only thing she asked for him to return was the motorcycle. It is in her name and he has no right to keep it.

She stopped in at my grandmas house (where my cousin lives) multiple times in the last 2 weeks to get the bike, but he was never there. So finally she brought the police with her a few days ago to get the bike. He wasnt home so they asked my grandma to call him and find out where he was. She spoke to him on speaker and the cops heard him telling her that he had no intention of giving the bike back before he had time to tear it apart. 

This brings me to my issue. Earlier today I overheard him telling my other cousin that hes keeping the bike at his new girlfriends house (the one he knocked up). I know where she lives. Would I be the asshole for calling the cops/the EX and telling them where to find the bike? They heard him saying he was planning to destroy it. Im not sure if she ever officially filed it as stolen, so I dont know what kind of trouble he could get into. But if they catch him on it and it was reported stolen he could go back to jail. He just got custody of his kid and has another one on the way. What do I do?

Update: I called his Ex not too long after I posted this. I told her where the bike was and asked how much trouble she thought he was going to get in. She said she hadnt reported it stolen yet and as long as she gets it back without any damage she wont file any charges. She didnt want him to get in any trouble either, but he was being difficult. I went after that. Ill find out today if she got it back."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2bcni	2019-06-19 02:27:10	wedditter	AITA for thinking my bf congratulations are insincere?	"So I got into nursing school today after taking prerequisites and stressing out about it for a year (I put off graduation for the prereqs so it’s kind of a big deal for me). My boyfriend was initially excited for me and was telling me that he’s proud of me. But as the night went on, he kept on repeating “I’m so proud of you” like a robot with waning enthusiasm and the last time that led to this question was when he was working on some documents. He said it in an almost flat tone as he was scrolling and reading off his laptop and didn’t even look at me. 
Don’t get me wrong, I am so thankful for his initial reaction and was so happy but he kept repeating himself in the most nonchalant way that takes the sincerity out of it. That’s why I find it so hard to tell him that I kind of don’t want him to say it unless he’s giving me the full moment. I told him very non confrontationally (was hugging-him from-behind-and-resting-my-chin-on-his-shoulder non confrontational) that I know he’s busy but I’d appreciate it more if he could give me his sole attention for a second when he says it because saying it so nonchalantly takes away from the sincerity. He got very upset with me for attacking his sincerity. It’s a minor thing but AITA?
Edit: seems like some are misunderstanding the situation. I’m not asking him to keep congratulating me. He’s doing it on his own but the problem I have is that he’s taking it upon himself to keep repeating it but with less sincerity each time."	Asshole	0	0

Later on this year he is turning 8 years old, and we have noticed he is having problems seeing things in front of him. It started with him not seeing treats right in front of his face and him having to use his smell to find it, and it has progressed to him walking face first into walls and walking under a table, (he never did this before) realizing his mistake, he backs out from under. We are thinking of getting a new Akita puppy for if and when he goes completely blind (were not getting rid of him, were just having the puppy and him at the same time). I know there are people who have two dogs living with each other, but something seems morally wrong about getting another dog because of his progressing blindess. And there is also the unrelated problem about how male akitas treat other dogs (especially other small dogs and male Akitas). WIBTA if we go through with this?	No A-holes here	0	0
c2b9qf	2019-06-19 02:19:11	possiblybadparents	AITA for giving our younger daughter a special day in which our older daughter doesn't get a say?	"My wife Mandy and I have two daughters. Katie, 20 and Abbie, 17. We love them both dearly but they are polar opposites. 

Katie, to put it simply was the child most parents dream of. She has always been confident, outgoing and eager to make new friends. Throughout her childhood and teen years she had lots of friends and was also a very high achiever academically. She did very well at school and got into a very good uni on one of their most selective courses. She is a huge party girl and loves being the centre of attention. 

As for Abbie, she is the total opposite. She is quite an introverted person, which is fine, and she has a very small - but close - circle of friends. She hated school and left at the first opportunity, and chose to do an apprenticeship, which she really enjoys and we couldn't be happier for her. She is very pretty like her sister but doesn't have the same kind of glamorous personality. She hates being the centre of attention and prefers to do her own little thing.

We love both our children equally, but Abbie is also close to Mandy's sister Ruth, and they've had a few heart-to-hearts. Ruth took us aside last weekend and told us that Abbie has opened up about how she feels overshadowed by Katie. We are always praising Katie's achievements or talking about things that Katie has said or done. Abbie said that we haven't openly praised anything she's done for years and sadly that's true. According to Ruth, when Katie is away at uni we are talking about what she's up to, while when she's home her louder personality means she gets most of the attention. Ruth said everyone noticed that Katie gets more attention than Abbie. 

Mandy was upset and I was close to tears at the fact that we treated our own child this way. She feels unloved and unwelcome in her own home. Mandy and me sat Abbie down and she admitted she did often feel like we don't care about her.

Abbie's birthday is a while away, but I suggested that this weekend we organise a day in which we just do things that she likes. Let her be take charge for the day. Abbie likes the idea and so does Mandy. 

Katie is home from uni, and I asked her if she was free this weekend so we can have a ''family day''. She kept trying to suggest things to do, but I explained that we were going to let her sister decide the activities of the day. Katie said that the stuff Abbie is into is ''boring'' and I said she doesn't have to take part if she doesn't think she'll have fun. She kept trying to suggest things to do but I bluntly told her that the day wasn't about her it was about Abbie. 

Katie stormed off sobbing and I regretted it straight away. In trying to do something nice for one daughter I've gone and made the other one feel excluded. 

Should I have heard Katie out or is it best to make it solely Abbie's special day?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2b8hf	2019-06-19 02:15:45	TerrestrialRover	AITA For not wanting to watch my parents dogs?	"So I live and work about an hour away from my parents. For the past 4 years they've gone on a week long vacation in February, and I have agreed each year to spend the week at their house to watch their 4 dogs. This means that I have to commute from their house.

The past couple of years this has been really inconvenient. I've been working 9-10hrs a day, 6 days a week for over two years now. The work I do is fairly labor intensive, and I generally feel worn out towards the end of the day. Commuting that extra hour each way really eats into my free time. Also because it's in February the roads are often covered in snow and ice, making the drive fairly dangerous. Two of the four dogs pee and poop on the floor frequently, and they bark all night long, pretty much ruining my sleep when I stay there.

After babysitting the dogs last winter, I politely told them that it really kind of sucked and I'd appreciate it if they asked my brother or somebody else to do it next time. My mom refuses to consider anyone else, saying that I'm the only person she trusts. My brother is lazy and unreliable, but that's not my fault. I keep telling her no in a polite way, but every time she sees me now, she basically asks me over and over if I will watch the dogs for them. She makes me feel guilty about it, because they go on these vacations during their wedding anniversary. I took them out to dinner this past Sunday for Father's day and towards the end my mom spent a solid 5-10 minutes asking me again and again, refusing to take no for an answer. She only stopped when I said I needed to get going.

I just don't feel like this should be my responsibility every year. I get that it's hard to trust people to basically live at your house and take care of your pets, and hard to find people willing to do it. But maybe they should've thought about that before getting so many dogs. Am I the asshole for not wanting to watch their dogs?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My (F) husband (M) and I have been married 7yrs (both mid 30's) together for 10yrs. I love the man to pieces but thing is my husband has no ability to make decisions, on nothing, nada, zero, nothing. If he is hungry he'll come to me and say that he is hungry, the man isn't disabled me is more than capable of making food. We have bills to pay, he is more than capable of making a call but no. He tells me that a bill has to be paid and I end up doing it. Of course we have the loop of what resturant do you want to go to when we are out. He told me he had a achy tooth earlier today, I can go on and on.


Today we were visiting his family and his mom asked him to make a run to the store of course he asked me to go with him, I said no. He was whining when he asked me **why** for a second I thought our 3yo niece was talking to me. I told him he was more than capable of going on his own, his mom gave him a picture of the items to pick up, and he didn't need me to go with him.


He then said, whining like a child again, ""oh come on come with me. I don't want to mess it up."" I snapped, I was so angry, with his mom and sister right there and told him to ""shut the f**k-up and stop whining."" I also called him a crybaby. He told me I was rude, heartless and disrespectful. Husband stormed out and his mother told me I need to check my tone when speaking to her son. Neither will speak to me and I'm stuck here with his family for 9 days (vacation).


AITA?


EDIT: I'm the absolute worst asshole who has ever walked the planet. I'll go crawling to my husband and beg for forgiveness. You know, since I'll end up divorced over some words.


EDIT: I don't know if it matters but I did ask him to stop, multiple times. I was tired and asked him to stop with the please, please, please (whining like a child) in my face and poking my arm. His mom joined in saying, oh come on, go with him. Then boom, I snapped."	Asshole	0	0

M's family is quite supportive and was a stable presence in her teenage years during which she transitioned. M has lived a life, thankfully, mostly free of transphobia and prejudice.

I am getting married in August. My groom is from Brazil, and a large part of his family is coming to the USA (We live in Florida). My groom's family is extremely conservative and traditional, and my groom has told me Brazil can be extremely unwelcoming to queer people, especially people who are 'openly' transgender. 

Basically, to avoid any kind of potentially violent confrontation between an idiot member of my groom's family (there are many from my experience) I told M that I wouldn't make her an ""official"" bridesmaid. She would still come to the wedding, reception, etc. and be by my side but I want to decrease her visibility for her own safety. 

M is quite angry with me, and says she might as well not come at all if I was going to pretend she didn't exist. I told her it was my wedding and my right to choose who the bridesmaids were, and that it was naive of her to assume everything would be fine when half the guests are most likely open transphobes. She left quite irritated, and told me that I don't have a right to say that.

I feel quite bad, and I am considering apologising to her and changing my plans. I'm telling myself I did this out of concern for my best friend's safety, but I know it gets to a point where it seems as if I'm ashamed of her existing. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c2b1uz	2019-06-19 01:57:17		WIBTA if I asked my nanny to stop breastfeeding in front of my husband?	"My family has a unique situation. Husband and I work full time but we are both now able to work from home much more frequently. However, our schedules aren’t really less busy so we still have our nanny on full time. 

Overall my nanny is great. When she announced she was pregnant I thought she might quit after giving birth. However, after taking 8 weeks off, she returned to us. She would now need to bring her baby to our home for obvious reasons. I was (and am) okay with this. My son is almost 10 now and doesn’t require as much attention as he did when my nanny first started. (She’s been with us for a little over four years). So it seemed that everything was working out really well. 

The problem is the breastfeeding. I am all for women having the freedom to feed their children without shame. I have always considered myself to be a liberal person as well, but perhaps not as much as I once thought. My nanny has a tendency to just start feeding wherever, whenever and she does not cover. On two occasions (that I am aware of) my husband has been in the room. He somewhat awkwardly looked away and made some excuse to leave both times. I’ve also caught my son ogling her once, which I spoke with him about. I don’t think he meant any harm but he is growing and curious (and not as tactful as I am trying to teach him to be). 

I don’t want to ramble anymore, so I’ll just say that the situation is making me slightly uncomfortable. I plan to bring the subject up tactfully with her (by asking her to cover or, alternatively, go into any empty room she chooses when she plans to feed). My concern of course is that this can be a very touchy subject...and I’m not sure if I’m out of bounds for making this request."		1	0
c2b1fu	2019-06-19 01:56:17	JunjiDrrDrr	AITA for wishing my friend would shut up about his weight loss	" 

*(Posting under a burner)*

Setting the scene: My best friend and I have known each other since middle school and we are currently in our late-30s. We have both struggled with our weight for most of our lives and have been each other's strongest supports when it came to weight loss, self-esteem, dating as plus-sized LGBTQ+ individuals, etc. 

A few years ago, I became more invested in healthy living by working out and eating better and was feeling better about myself. During this time, I also decided to return to graduate school to open up my job prospects. I know that everyone's experience in grad school is different, but I found my mental health was extremely negatively infected due to the expectations and challenges. I also gained A LOT of weight during this time because of stress eating and relying on junk food and alcohol to keep myself sane. Don't get me wrong, it was rewarding to finish and obtain my degree but I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem since I graduated. I’ve shared my struggles with my best friend regularly and although he isn’t always the most empathetic person, he never hesitates to provide a safe venting space. 

About a year ago, my friend was diagnosed with a (non-life threatening) medical disorder that caused him to start shedding pounds at a dramatic rate (he’s dropped about 4 sizes in the last year). The rapid weight loss has done wonders for his confidence and he’s excitedly shared with me the changes in his dating life and his self-esteem. It seems as if he's become a more secure version of himself and it's definitely been a positive change. I’ve been so happy for him and very supportive.   
 

However - recently it’s been becoming too much. It seems like he spends more and more time finding ways to humblebrag about his weight loss. He will complain about having to update his wardrobe, send selfies under the guise of eliciting an opinion on his outfits, moan about how guys only want him for his body now, etc. I’ve been dropping hints for him to scale back the bragging but don’t want to come on too strong because I am still his friend and I want him to share his thoughts and feelings with me like we always do. I’ve even used my own struggle with mental health and weight gain as stronger clues but it’s been useless. The final straw came last week when he told me “Oh my god, so I’m finally down to regular sizes at \[his favorite clothing store\] which sucks because those sizes are always sold out, UGH!” I bit my tongue at the time but since then I’ve been slow to respond to, or flat out ignoring, his texts. I just feel as though he’s become so self-absorbed now that he’s skinnier that he’s either naive to my hints or is completely ignoring my feelings altogether. Although another part of me thinks I should get the fuck over it.

I [23f] have known my guy friend [24m] for 8 years. I met him my sophomore year in high school and we became really good friends. He would hangout with me and a group of friends during lunch, but not all the time, but that's how we got close. 6 months later after getting to know each other, he confessed to me on Facebook that he liked me, but I told him I didn't feel the same way. However, a few weeks later I started to like him too since he started hanging out with our group a little more during lunch. I told my best friend I was going to ask him if he wanted to go out with me after school and she wished me luck. I asked him, but sadly he wasn't ready to get into another relationship since he just got out of one. I understood and took the rejection well and we remained good friends. After the rejection I no longer liked him and only saw him as a close friend. Fast forward 8 years later, which is now, he still likes me but I have told him I don't like him and only see him as a friend. Despite me telling him that, he continues to flirt with me via messenger. He calls me sexy, and sends kissing emojis to me and other stuff implying he wants to have sex with me. I've been ignoring him for the last 2 weeks since he doesn't seem to get the message I only like him as a friend. He's the only guy friend I have and because of the the things he's been recently doing is why I don't have any male friends. I'm currently pregnant by my ex and I honestly don't want to be with anyone for a long time after having 3 failed relationships. My guy friend knows I'm pregnant but it didn't stop him from flirting with me and sending me subminial messages of him wanting to have sex with me. AITA or NTA?

Another fact: I live overseas - my wife, her parents and mine are from my native island. We somehow got through the wedding, my wife came to live with her abroad.

The relationship status did not change . It was civil but nothing more than that, due to the aftermath of the wedding.

This year, My wife and I seeing her a psychotherapist to help us to work through some of these family issues. The relationship between and my parents also got strained. I was able to approach with the issue and talked to them that they have to respect my wife. Tjey acknowledged the issues and want to move on.

The issue: my sister turns 30 this year and she wanted the 5 of us, my parents, me and my 2 siblings to get a family tattoo. My parents are visiting us and she wanted to use tjat occasion to do something together. I agreed. She asked that if my wife were interested, that she can join us as well. Note that the relationship between my sisters and her was strained in the beginning but they are now much much better.

I have multiple tattoos. And i have not gotten anymore since i got married since my wife did not appreciate me getting more. Now this is different. This is something that I want to do. I want to tell her about it. My concern is that she feels left out and mentions for The 1000th time that she is not part of the family."	Not enough info	0	0

"Back in highschool, I had a pretty big friend circle that was separated by sub-friend circles if you know what I mean. We all ate lunch together but we’d spend most of our time in different groups of 3-4. 

So there’s this guy (K) that was head over heels for this girl (Q). I had already hooked up once with Q the summer before the school year, but it was a one time kind of deal. I wasn’t close friends with K, he ate lunch with us and played video games with some of my friends but that’s how far our “friendship” went. He wasn’t part of my sub-friend circle.

Around the start of the year, K ended up asking Q out on a date and she said yes! Rumour has it that they kissed and that K told Q he loved her at the end of the date, which made Q uncomfortable. They went on another date but it didn’t work out because K was a bit too clingy according to Q.

Here’s where I come in. At Halloween, Q texted me and we reconnected. We saw eachother and hooked up. I didn’t even think about K when I saw Q.

Anyways, I told K about hooking up with Q because we were both waiting for our parents to pick us up from school. He was pissed, really pissed. He started spreading rumours about me over the course of several months!

To this day, some of my friends still think I was the asshole, but some think I did nothing wrong because I didn’t consider K as my friend. I don’t think I did anything wrong.

c2aycf	2019-06-19 01:47:40	CaptainCayden2077	AITA for wanting for report someone for being loud, before even telling anything?	"For a little background info, my girlfriend and I live in a dorm-like apartment: she and I have our own rooms, we share a bathroom, but everyone on the floor shared the kitchen. We’ve been living there for almost a month. Residing directly across the five-foot wide hallway from my girlfriend- and thus very close to me- is possibly the loudest resident I have shared a building with. 

For one, he often stays up very late, playing loud music and singing equally loud- if not louder. This happens at least four times a week, at one in the morning, 8 in the morning, or at random times throughout the day. This can go on for a few minutes or up to half an hour. 

The second thing he does is slamming his door. Maybe he’s not slamming it, but he sure is letting it shut itself, and the doors here shut quickly and loudly. This happens several times a day. 

I’d appreciate if he wasn’t so loud. As a gamer, I know I can be loud at times, but I work every day until 6pm, so I don’t game until the afternoon-evening, and once it reaches 10-11pm, I make sure to shut my mouth. As for the door, I make sure that before my door shuts itself, I catch it and close it slowly. These two things don’t seem that hard to me. 

My girlfriend and I have very different views about how to go about this. She wants to put a note on his door, asking him to be quieter and more considerate. I, on the other hand, want to report him immediately. Her reasoning is that this guy is the fuck-buddy of a friend of ours- more her friend than mine. My reasoning is that he doesn’t need a passive aggressive note to “not be so loud and inconsiderate,” because if he’s being this loud for this long, he probably doesn’t give a fuck. In addition, if he knows we out the note on his door or has a hunch it’s us, I have no idea what he might do- maybe he’ll stop, maybe he’ll be even louder as a “fuck you.” I have no idea, but I’m sure he’ll react better to management than us. 

TL; DR: a resident in the same building is extremely loud, and I want to report him, but my girlfriend wants to leave a note for him. 

So, AITA the asshole for not wanting to “talk to him,” and reporting him immediately? Should we talk to him?

Edit: Apparently people assumed I know this guy. I can understand the wording is confusing. When I said “and this very close to me,” I meant that his room is physically close to me, not that he is personally close to me.

But I've noticed that some of my wife's pictures she has posted on social media is set to ""public"", and one of them is our children in their padding pool. My wife thinks it's not a big deal, but I'm really not happy with the idea that literally anyone can obtain images of our children and do what they want to them. I've always been a little paranoid about things my whole life but I told my wife that it was really irresponsible and she ended up being really pissed off with me, but we made up later as we always do if we get in minor arguments. She considered posting a video of one of our kids on r/aww and I immediately objected to that and eventually convinced her not to.

I'm not really comfortable with posting my kids anywhere on the Internet, but especially in public view.

c2axsf	2019-06-19 01:46:11	throwaway1015222516	WIBTA if i fired an employee for being stupid	"I know it sounds incredibly wrong, but bear with me.

&#x200B;

Throw away for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

So, i manage a relatively newly formed team and we handle all the clerical things across our organisation.

Our call centre was having problems with one of their staff, lets call her B, B has had ongoing issues, has a history of making big mistakes consistently, takes excessive amounts of sick days and lacks interpersonal skills, so she was the cause for problems within her team. They couldn't fire her at that time, so instead they asked if i would take her on in my team, this would get her away from being external facing and being a smaller team, there would be less opportunity for conflict.

&#x200B;

This worked initially, her attendance improved, she seemed really enthusiastic and eager to learn etc. but it has steadily been going down hill. She has managed to master two very simple tasks over the last almost 12 months, beyond that she requires a lot of hand holding. B seems entirely incapable of critical thinking and basic problem solving. Her attendance has started to drop again and her attitude is piss poor. If she doesn't understand a task she gets incredibly frustrated, she flys off the handle so easily and just seems to make things a bigger problem than they are. She really struggles to interpret information and will respond to an email or make changes to something and it will be nothing to do with what was requested of her. It's almost like she is a complete idiot. I will explain a process to her, walk her through how to do something and 20 minutes later she has forgotten how to do it and needs my help again. 

&#x200B;

My problem on top of all this is i feel protective of her, because i have invested so much time and energy trying to bring her up to speed, i feel like she thinks we are friends and i feel like i am not being supportive of my team but it has gotten to the point where i can't focus on my own workload which is getting bigger and bigger because i constantly need to help her or explain a process to her for the 50th time. I desperately want to fire her, but i feel really bad about it. I honestly think if i fired her she would struggle to find employment, she is in her 30s and has not really progressed in any role beyond entry level and her behavior/attitude is what i would expect from someone in their late teens to early 20s. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes i am literally left shaking my head at how badly she has fucked something so incredibly easy up, but none of these things are really things i could fire her over, i would have to performance manage her out and it would really all be down to her being stupid. I am kind of rambling now, this has just been going on for so long and i am over it, i want her out but i feel like an asshole because it's not like it's her fault, this stuff just isn't a strength of hers.

SO, my 21st birthday/party is this friday. i made a group chat with my friends all the way in march about having a party, and a few weeks ago she said she’d let me know if she was scheduled to work or not. i hadn’t heard anything this week so i texted her to ask if she was coming and she says: 

“omg i meant to text u i have to work friday night i’m sorry :-(“
me: “ahh darn” 
her: “ik i picked up a shift a couple weeks ago not even realizing what day it was”

I am not the best at math (b+, I am always heckled for that) and you have to have the same thought process as math so I wasn't good and in general I wasn't into it. Today he was explaining and teaching stuff and he said that if I dont get the stuff now I wouldn't get it and I would end up just like my math gra- and he stopped because he knew he was stepping on dangerous territory and quickly changed the sentence.

He would laugh at me when I screamed and cried. I grew up afraid to pass by closets because of it, always expecting him to jump out. To this day, even though I don’t live with my father, I feel nervous opening closets, large cabinets, pulling open shower curtains, or walking in a room, thinking that someone might be hiding behind the door.

I don’t have a good relationship with my father for many reasons, this just being one of them. I saw him for a BBQ with my kids for Father’s Day.  As he was coming in the house, I decided to duck hide behind the island in the kitchen and jump out when he came to get something. He freaked out much much more than I expected. He screamed loudly enough that my mom, wife, and kids came running inside to see what was wrong. He had his hand over his heart and was gasping heavily before breaking down into my mom’s arms.

c2awpp	2019-06-19 01:43:09	AffectionateMixture3	AITA for giving my son’s girlfriend on birth control, knowing her parents would not approve?	"My son (Allen) and his girlfriend (Jessica) are both 16. They’ve been dating for almost 5 months now, which is the longest relationship Allen’s ever been in. I knew from the get-go that he was sexually active; he was in the past with his previous girlfriends and has always been open to us. I always give the two privacy because at the end of the day, I rather they do it in the privacy of their home versus getting caught in public and risk jail time.

Jessica’s parents aren’t as... observant. They’ve called me and my husband quite a few times to check up on Jessica and make sure I’m at the house while she’s over here to “make sure her and Allen are not getting too close”. I assure her that I intend to stay at home while she’s here (which is technically the truth).

But recently my son confided in me that they’re getting “serious” now and they want to experiment with not using condoms, because they’re exclusive. He asked if I could help Jessica get on a long-acting birth control. Their rationale is that her parents won’t, but they want to be safe, and they didn’t really know who else to ask.

He told me they just needed my help driving them since it’s over 50 miles away. He said it’ll likely be sometime in August because they needed to save up as they didn’t want to bill it under her parents insurance.

I told him that’s nonsense and I’ll just cover the cost, and to tell her to book an appointment now. He was very grateful and couldn’t stop thanking me. He’s a good kid; I just want them to be safe.

Well I brought it up nonchalantly to my husband when, to my surprise, he was COMPLETELY against the idea. He said it was completely disrespectful to go behind her parents back and put their teen daughter on birth control.

I told him that they’re having sex, and just because they want live with their head up their asses doesn’t mean I’m going to put my child’s future on the line. My children expressed they want to have sex, and that they want to not use condoms. They’re going to do it; I might as well make sure they’re safe.

He maintained this was something that they should’ve figured out by themselves, but if the parents found out, they would be betrayed, and he wouldn’t blame him. I told him I already told my son I’d do it, so there’s no turning back now, when he reluctantly dropped it. It got me wondering if I was actually TA here."	Asshole	0	0

He generally relies on my mother to wake him up for his shifts, and I’ve only ever seen him get up by himself at most 5 times.

Yesterday I was supposed to wake him up, because both of my parents were gone for work.

I dont like the idea of a 20 year old man living in his parents house(no rent btw) and relying on his family to do what a normal, functioning person can do easily. I let him sleep.

Apparently yesterday he had his third strike due to being late/not showing up and was subsequently fired from said chain pizza restaurant.

My mother and brother are pissed at me, however my dad agrees with me.

My brother said that he can’t wake up by himself or with an alarm because he’s “different” and works “horrible hours” ,on an average day he works 4pm-midnight.

I was paired with a girl that I'm friends with, and she is really smart and good at english. Before the test started, we received our grades for our written test and, to my surprise, noone got high grades.

&#x200B;

Me and this girl received similar grades (a 7.9), however, I noticed that there were some correction mistakes, that I instantly pointed out to the teacher. Those mistakes took almost 15 minutes to be corrected, since there were so many. I also asked some questions about the answers that I got wrong, because I wanted to understand what I was not doing right. In the end, we both got an 8.5.

&#x200B;

Before I go on, I must note that the test is 15 minutes long, so, because of that, we started 15 minutes later than planned, which made her parents wait for her for a really long time. After finishing the test, she bolted down the stair that takes us to the exit and quickly entered her parent's car (she probably got scolded by them).

&#x200B;

Today, I went to school and everything was fine. However, when I was looking through twitter to find a picture that a friend had recently posted (NOTE: I don't have a twitter account), I stumbled upon this girl's twitter acc. While looking through it, I find a tweet that was written after the test that said I ""was crying for grades"" and that I ""would die alone and no human being can tolerate him\[me\]"". My heart sank and I had an anxiety attack. I had lots of respect for this girl and now I feel betrayed, it's as if she was talking shit behind my back all this time. I actually felt (and am still feeling) like I was punched in the stomach.

&#x200B;

I understand that, sometimes, I can be stubborn. However, I feel like this was a knee-jerk reaction and such a dirty move (since I wouldn't be able to defend myself) and, idk why, but I feel like an asshole for making her get scolded by her parents.

"My ex (30m) and I (33f) have shared custody of our 4 year old daughter. He has a epilepsy which causes him to have petit-mal seizures every couple of weeks. These are small seizures which don’t make him fully seize but make him disoriented, confused, cause him to have trouble speaking and make him very tired for quite some time after. He has had two grand-mal seizures in the past (it’s been over a year since the last one) but they are severe and he fell and hit his head badly one time and flipped her stroller over when he had one.

We don’t get along well all the time but keep it pretty civil for her and we have a custody agreement that works quite well. Part of our agreement is getting a week with her in the summer. For his week he wants to take her to his cottage just the two of them. They would be dropped off there (45 min from the city) and picked up a week later as he cannot drive because of his seizures. 

AITA for telling him that I don’t want him going there alone with her given his condition? I just feel that it’s not safe to be in the middle of nowhere with a child when he could have a seizure and not be able to get help quickly. The reception isn’t great there and the neighbouring cottages aren’t always occupied so it may not be easy to get help if it were needed. 

His point of view is that he has epilepsy and I have to accept it. He says he notices the warning signs and puts himself in a safe place and gets through it without her knowing. He says he is certain that he can take good care of her."	No A-holes here	0	0

"The majority of the time I [15f] have a really good relationship with my mom, but when it comes to my appearance we butt heads constantly. She makes passive-aggressive comments about how I don’t shave my legs (a conscious choice that I make, not me being lazy), the color of my teeth (I drink a lot of tea, so they’re a bit stained), my haircut (nothing crazy- just a pixie), my glasses (she wants me to wear contacts), but most of all my skin. I wash my face and exfoliate every night, but I do still get some mild acne. She comments on it constantly and is always trying to get me to try a new product she’s found.

Because of that, because my skin really doesn’t bother me, and because I feel I’m taking decent care of it as it is, I stopped trying them and told her that I really didn’t care that much about what my skin looked like.

WIBTA for organising an intervention with her friends?	"My relative had never been in a real relationship before, but has been with this guy for over a year now. She moved in with him and left a well paying job for a lower paying one that's closer to the guy's house. 

The relationship has been iffy from the start, when she talks about him, it's 90% negative, the positives from the relationship are frankly really standard, bare minimum relationship things. For example she considers ""we had a great weekend watching shows together and laughing"" as a justification that the relationship isn't all bad. Sorry, but that's what my husband & I do literally every night, that's just what you do when you live with your partner, it's not special. The guy never goes out of his way for her, didn't even come to her birthday (last year or this year). 

A couple months ago they ""were done"" and she came to our house in the morning. We let her stay in our guest room. She went back to the guy that night.
Last week he apparently kicked her out of the house. So late at night on a weekday, she came to ours again, this time with her belongings. My husband & I were relieved that maybe this time they really are done. The next day I spent hours listening to her rant about all the shit the guy has done and reassuring her that ending the relationship is the right thing to do. The day after she went and got the rest of her things from his house. We were all very supportive of this step (my husband, me, her friends).

Next thing we know she's gone back to the asshole and has been at his for nearly a week now, with barely a word to us, all her stuff is still all over the floor in the guest room.
Yesterday she messaged me apologising for being MIA and saying she's confused and embarrassed. I'm not sure what response she expected from me, but I unloaded on her that she is being stupid and finding excuses to go back to a fucked up relationship that isn't good for either of them. She kept trying to defend the relationship. I don't think she was pleased with my honesty. She hasn't left him. She hasn't said a word to me. She hasn't been back to our place.

I've exhausted my efforts to get her to see some sense and value herself. The only thing I can think of to do now is contact her friends to intervene and slap some sense into her because maybe coming from me she might misconstrue it as me not wanting to put her up in my house. (I don't mind having her live here until she gets back on her feet if she leaves the guy, but I don't like my guest room being a storage unit because she can't face reality.)

TL;DR: relative is in a shitty relationship but keeps going back despite several people telling her it needs to end. 

AITA for being blunt and telling her I don't think the guy really loves her, but just loves having someone take care of everything in the house? WIBTA if I got her other friends involved to do an intervention because maybe hearing the truth from more people will get her to face facts?

"I'm in college and home with my parents for the summer, and our house is pretty small and we don't get company often so there isn't a guest room. Whenever any of my siblings come to visit us, they either stay in a hotel nearby or they sleep on an air mattress in the home office.

Because my sister has kids, she usually asks to use my bedroom instead for more space, so I end up on the air mattress.

I prefer not to let them use my bedroom because it's inconvenient, they move my things, and they put the baby in there so I lose access to my bedroom whenever the baby needs a nap or goes to bed. Plus there's just kind of an aroma around the baby that lingers after they leave? But overall I feel like it shouldn't be a big deal, since it's only like five nights I'm put out. I usually want to say no, but I end up saying yes because everyone expects me to.

But they're coming to visit soon, and I know they're trying for a baby. I'm not supposed to know, but a mutual friend let it slip to me, plus the fact that my sister fully intends to keep trying during their visit, which means sex in my bed.

I'm really uncomfortable with the idea of them having sex in my bed, even though I know I can wash the sheets and it's not like I haven't slept on hotel beds where surely plenty of people have also had sex. And since I'm not supposed to know that my sister is trying to get pregnant, I can't tell them that's the reason I'm saying no, so I'll just look selfish.

Last time I babysat these kids I told them they couldn’t watch TV (per the mother’s orders) and the 5th header proceeded to throw a fit. He then stormed off and went to read. The 8th grader and I then played Uno for a while before making a game up called Guess That Song (self explanatory). The 5th grader came back to play, but every time I got something right that he got wrong he’d throw something at me. This ranged from earbuds to a wooden napkin holder. 

That day I only babysat for 2 hours, and I fear for some of the 7-9 hour days that I have coming later in the summer. That day left a very bad taste in my mouth and I really don’t want to go back and babysit again. WIBTA for telling the mom I can’t babysit her kids anymore?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2asvq	2019-06-19 01:32:38		AITA for wanting to attend my mentally unstable stepbrother’s wedding?	"Made an alt just so I could post this. 
Hello! 
 
About nine years ago, when I was ten years old, what I like to refer to as “the incident” occurred. My stepbrother, who we’ll refer to as H, was my absolute best friend. He came into my life at a point where I had nobody else to talk to or confide in, and I admired him for that.

 Alas, he had a lot of mental issues I wasn’t aware of spanning back to before I had met him, and one day he pulled a knife on my stepfather, lacerated his arm, and was taken away to a psychiatric hospital in Michigan. It was so mentally scarring that my youngest brother, who was 8 at the time, wound up not being able to sleep at night and eventually even wound up having to go to therapy. 

Well... Flash forward to the present, and my stepbrother’s changed his name, graduated collage, and was actually recently engaged! He reached out to me via Facebook to ask if I’d like to come to the wedding and, seeing as to how I’m old enough and have enough money to go down and attend, I truly don’t see why I shouldn’t go. It’s been years since I talked to him, and last I checked, we weren’t on bad terms? 

However- when I brought this up to my family ( I made sure my younger brother wasn’t around for obvious reasons ), everyone IMMEDIATELY started flipping their shit. They called me disrespectful and advised me not to go to the wedding under any circumstances. Do they think he’d hurt me after nine years of counseling and help? It hadn’t occurred to me that after “the incident” they had cut ties with my stepbrother entirely. 

So, have at me, AITA for wanting to go to his wedding?"		1	0

Not wanting to walk all the way home empty handed and have to make another trip tonight, I just took my lucky break and continued the transaction.

c2ardv	2019-06-19 01:28:30		AITA for asking my boyfriend to cancel reservations he spent $100 on?	"Six months ago my boyfriend gave me my birthday present which was a little piece of paper in the shape of a ticket saying it was for an all expense paid trip to a place a few states over that I had been wanting to go to. The original intention was that we were going to fly there, rent a car, etc. Now, his family has planned a week long vacation in the state next to the state we were planning to go to and everyone in the family is driving with their own SO's from different places to meet up . We figure since we are already going to be so close, we will just drive to the other state and have a little vacation for a few days. 

The state we are going to has a big national forest which is very different and exciting compared to our home state. The original intention was to camp but because of the bad weather it will just be easier to find a place to stay. I started looking at airbnb's and found a lot of really cool places in secluded areas for about $80/night for the entire place to ourselves. I was ready to book them last night but he told me to hold off until today so we did. 

He then texted me this afternoon to let me know we'd be staying at a hotel in \[neighboring city to national park\] which happens to be a huuuge tourist destination for families due to the activities in the city. Now, immediately I am very disappointed. Neither him nor I are the type to want to stay in a hotel in a city when we are intending to do nature-y activities all day. It's also going to be filled with kids/families which doesn't sound nice either.  I ask him why he booked this without checking with me and it turns out he got some type of voucher 1 month after my birthday that is $100 for 2 nights (you pick the dates later)  to the certain chain of hotel. He called last week to inquire about the day we would be there and they were booked. He called again this morning and they happened to open up so he booked them without saying anything to me last night or this morning. 

I called him and mentioned at first that this isn't the type of place we both would like and he agrees, but tells me he got a great deal for it and we will still have fun regardless. I straight up ask him if we could get a refund and rebook at a place in the middle of woods because I do not want to stay at this hotel he booked. He gets upset and says he wouldn't want to deal with trying to get a refund and if we rebooked he would just count it as a loss and that I complain about everything. We are on the phone and he is obviously frustrated and he's telling me to make a decision, should he book the airbnb's or not? I am getting upset at this point because he is yelling and I do feel like i'm being ungrateful. But the place that we stay and our surroundings are at least 50% of the excitement for me. I understand not everyone feels this way or even cares where they stay when on vacation if the deal if good enough. I still would much rather try to get him a refund and stay in the airbnb's.

A bit of backstory - I'm a 20 y/o Male and it's always been a dream of mine to enlist and serve my country, I my mum despised the idea of me enlisting and my dad has been somewhat supportive and my friends/girlfriend were also somewhat supportive.

I recently made it through training and was away from friends and family for 2 months, in the Australian army its typically a month for training but myself and 3 other recruits got picked for the commando selection course (an unexpected surprise but a very welcome one) so we did another month of training to prepare for selection, I didnt tell anyone about the extra month because it was just another training course.

A few days ago I finally got to come home after 2 months away from everyone and I was very happy to finally see everyone, I went home to see my parents expecting a warm welcome and lots of hugs but what I got was the complete opposite, what I got was a normal ""hey how are you going?"" like I hadn't been away for 2 months, I brushed it off and started asking them how they were and how everything's been and all I got was one word answers, I'm not gonna lie it kinda hurt but oh well.

I visited my girlfriend next and she was really happy to see me, she gave me a big hug and lots of kisses which was nice, I visited my friends next and expected another welcome but once again I was met with one word answers and kinda like wtf looks, all of my friends made excuses to not talk to me anymore and that hurt a lot, first my parents and now my friends.

I had my two best friends to still visit but honestly I was pretty upset and didnt want to because I dont know how I would have felt if they gave me the same reaction, my girlfriend saw that I was upset and cheered me up, luckily my best friends were really happy to see me.

After talking to my best friends for a while I went with my girlfriend back to my parents house to try and talk to them again but this time I got yelled at, that's when I found out my mum was anti war or army idk and my dad was a coward, while I stood there speechless my mum continued her tirade and kept berating me, my dad looked like he wanted to stop her and say something but he didnt, he just stared at the ground.

By that point I'd started getting more and more angry and my girlfriend could tell so she basically dragged me out of the house, at that point I was done, I'm currently staying with my girlfriend and her parents and they're doing their best to make me feel at home.

I'm still kinda hurt because I didnt do anything to warrant that kind of reaction from my friends and family, AITA here? The only reason for them acting like this is because I did the extra month of training without saying anything but Idk.

TL;DR - I come back home after 2 month of training in the army to my parents and most of my friends giving me the cold shoulder."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I took a few days off of school and let him use a bike and have been bringing him to the river, local youth centre playing video games with him, even playing with action figures and stuff like that, and it was fun, for like the first three days.

Then he Sam was nonstop with everything and his mom was letting him control me I was doing laundry and Sam asked if he could help, I politely declined and his mom looked at me with disbelief and said “you can let him help you.”

I can’t watch the shows I wanna watch or go up to my room to be alone, but I don’t want to be rude so I let him stay.

Sam is also extremely accident prone and every time he gets hurt he blames it on me, he got hurt playing basketball and said “you let him push me on the ground” I was watching and he double faked him and broke is ankles. He jumped in the river and tripped and said “I could have drowned you weren’t watching” I was looking straight at him and rushed as soon as he fell.

And he’s also extremely rude, if you say anything he doesn’t like he’ll call you a retard or a faggot, gay etc which is even  worse cause his sister is bi.

My friend then kind of ruined my relationship with her by previously saying stories that happened between us that weren’t exactly the best of the best. Despite that,with her being annoyed and everything I decided to give up. A month later in class, she seems to be cracking up whenever I tell a joke. So I decided that it might be time to redo things over and try again. 
The problem is; classes ended already and she is soon moving to the west coast. I already started texting her, but also caught word that she didn’t find me attractive “in general” from one of my friends that never lies to me or tells me unreliable information. On-top of that he is friends with someone who is very close friends with Amy that told him this information.  Due to me having to go to Italy in 2 weeks for a month, as well as her moving in around late July I am not sure if it is even worth pursuing a relationship with her anymore. Sadly, I have already committed and decided to text her and things are going well.

My best friend since 7th grade (graduated now) invited me to a road trip with his family and some other friends to Georgia. Since we’ve been friends for so long, I’m very well acquainted with his parents and two sisters. The trip was to last from first thing Friday morning to today, the 18th (I’m writing this on the ride home).
I’ve always known that my friend could be a bit much to handle in heavy doses but everyone has their flaws, nevertheless I’ve been excited to go on the trip for two months.
I’ve never met the other guests that his sisters brought (one homeschooled girl and two foreign exchange students from Germany) so I had intended on getting to know everyone since we would be sleeping in an rv for a long period of time. 
Well, my friend had other plans and wanted to hang out with my alone for the entire trip. When we would be out sightseeing, he would start doing annoying things that would usually make me laugh but it would interrupt conversations and make everyone else feel awkward. Don’t get me wrong, we still had fun together like intended, but when I split off to talk to the other group members, he would be right behind me with more conversation interrupting and butting in.
That’s a gist of what happened in the few days but I really felt bad when on the car ride back, I snuck my way into the opposite car with him not in it. The homeschooled girl that didn’t like him the most got upset with me when she was to be in the car with him and asked me to switch. His sister threw a fit and said that he was only bad when I was in the car with him so we got switched back.
To be honest I felt relieved but I still feel bad that he’s all alone for the long trip.

Names: Rose-Biological Daughter Emily-Stepdaughter 

My wife wanted to make one of our rooms a guest one. In order to achieve this, we had to force our respective daughters to share a room.

Both of them objected, but ultimately, they “agreed”. This led to the fight that I’m asking you about.

Rose put a sign on her wall. The sign read “As a libertarian, I support legalizing same-sex marriage. As a libertarian, I also think that people shouldn’t have to service weddings that violate their religious beliefs.” 

This opinion is obviously controversial, as I’m sure many disagree with it. However, I didn’t consider it that offensive. Then again, I’m not homosexual, and haven’t ever faced discrimination based on my sexual orientation. 

Emily’s friend found it offensive, and said that she was uncomfortable with it. Because of this, Emily said that Rose should have to remove it. Rose refused, saying ""I won’t silence my opinions just because they’re controversial or offensive.” 

My stepwife sided with Emily, which prompted Rose to say “If you want to avoid this, how about you give up the guest room? Then we would have separate rooms, and we wouldn’t have this issue.”

My stepwife says that she shouldn’t have to give up the guest room just so that Rose can keep a sign on her wall, but I disagree. Ultimately, that seems like the best option to me. Then Rose could have signs representing her opinions, and Emily’s friend wouldn’t be uncomfortable.

c2ajpp	2019-06-19 01:07:23	rozallin	AITA for reporting this minicab driver?	"TLDR: AITA for reporting a minicab driver for kicking us out after we refused to pay more than the pre-agreed fare because we chose a less than optimal pickup location?

My husband and I went to see a band tonight in the city centre. It was the first time we had been to the venue so we didn't know the area. We pre-booked a minicab from a firm based in our town which is on the very outskirts of the city and agreed on a fixed price to be picked up 40 minutes after the show ended. 

After the gig we realised there were a lot of vehicles outside so we were concerned that it might be difficult for our driver to find us. We spotted a supermarket directly across the road so -  thinking it would be less busy and easier to find -  I called the company again and they were happy to change the pickup location.

Unfortunately, many others had the same idea so when the taxi arrived there was a long and slow moving queue to get out of the supermarket car park and the driver got angry when he found out that we had agreed a set fare with the company rather than being on a meter. We apologised, explained that we had mistakenly thought it would have been easier to be picked up there, and volunteered to pay him a higher amount to make up for him losing out on other fares. As we sat in traffic, he called his base to complain to them about the situation and he kept chewing us out on how we should have walked down the road to a quieter spot instead. We decided not to respond to him since we'd already explained ourselves and apologised. By that point I didn't feel safe being in the car anymore because he was so angry. 

He then told us he was increasing the fare by a significant amount. We don't normally carry cash so we had taken out enough to cover the initial set fare and a tip, and by that point my husband was so annoyed with the driver's attitude that he countered that actually, ""for [the driver's] cheek"", we would now be paying the initial price fare agreed with the firm rather than the higher price we'd volunteered to give him. The driver ordered us to get out. 

We got an Uber in the end, and it cost exactly the same as the initial price agreed with the base.

Am I the asshole for reporting the driver to the local council who issue his licence? He probably lost 90 minutes of his shift for which he won't be paid. But who's to say that if we had agreed to his increased fare he wouldn't have tried to increase the price if we had encountered more delays farther along the route - if it's that much of an issue surely they could have factored that into the quoted price or refused the booking. We tried to complain to the base but they said he had told them he only asked for the extra amount we had volunteered to pay him, not the amount he actually asked for. And then they hung up the phone on us."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2ajnk	2019-06-19 01:07:13	1337swissroll	WIBTA if I cut off contact with my unsupportive family and insecure husband?	"For the record, I'm aware this will be biased because I'm writing it. Maybe my family is being unsupportive of me because the views/thoughts/actions I've expressed to them are actually unreasonable. I don't know if I'm being unreasonable. All I know is I've been unhappy for the past three years (I'm 26).

# What's wrong with my husband?

He's extremely insecure. He hid it pretty well the first year we were dating- I couldn't tell at all. After we got engaged, he would show signs of being moody, and after prodding him for an answer, it usually had to do with my guy friends.

Any time I made a new male friend, he would grow extremely suspicious of them. I never hung out with them one-on-one, always in groups to make him feel comfortable. However, he still would always question who I was with. Some days, we'd go through my Google maps location history to prove I was where I said I was going. Some days we'd go through all my phone messages to prove I wasn't lying about who I was with.

I've tried to reassure him that I loved him, and that I wouldn't leave him for anyone else, but it's getting tiring. This has been going on for our two year engagement, and one year of marriage so far. He'd frequently question me about certain moments, repeatedly, to see if my answer would ever change. 

He'd ask me to recall word for word my outings with my friends, multiple times, and if I ever slipped up, he'd drive straight into a line of questioning. Sometimes I would misremember the order of events, or leave out a detail one time and include it the next, and he'd get frustrated. It's hard to recall everything exactly as it happened- I can barely remember what I ate for lunch earlier this week.

I don't love this version of him, and I never thought he'd end up like this.

My parents are conservative and Asian, and would not be happy with this. I've tried to bring up what's been going on to my mom, but she says I'm being selfish, unreasonable, and I need to be more empathetic and caring towards him. She says I can't give up so easily just because things aren't easy.

If I got divorced, I'd be the first in my long line of cousins to do so, and people would be talking about it for the rest of my life. I'd rather not hear from my family at all, then hear them talk down about me all the time.

My parents would also not trust any of my future decisions about anything. They'd think I'm extremely responsible. I don't want to carry this with me for the rest of my life.

# So disappear?

Yeah. As much as I love my mom, dad, and my brother, I want to just cut off contact from all of them. I don't want to hear all the follow ups, and ""your immature""s, and all the fallout from getting divorced. I don't want to have to deal with it. I don't want to ruin my family's name by getting a divorce either (sorry this is a big thing in Asian cultures).

It's tough because I love my job and I love my friends. I'm afraid I might have to cut them out too if I really didn't want my family/husband to find me."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2ajli	2019-06-19 01:07:07	bravephilosopher	WIBTA for filing a Title IX complaint about my university's women-only gym hours?	"I am a college-aged athlete. My scholarship is for a lesser known sport, and it is not a full free ride; I still have to pay for part of my tuition, but receive certain benefits for playing my sport.

My school has a gym on campus. Unfortunately, some of the hours every day (7am to 10am) are exclusively for female students, while men get to work out there during other hours. I find this inconvenient because my best hours to work out would be 7am to 10am, but I have put up with it for a year.

They're planning on expanding those hours now to include another evening session. My school is a public university with federal funding, and having *any* hours which exclude men would be, by my understanding, a Title IX violation. I brought this up at my university with a professor, and she proceeded to tell me that what I was doing was unwanted and unnecessary. She kept cutting me off when I tried to explain my feelings and saying that I should let it go and pick a bigger battle to fight.

Would I be the asshole if I went ahead and filed a complaint anyway? I'm paying for school too, albeit slightly less because I make the difference up in athletic endeavors, but I legitimately find this unfair and discriminatory."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2aj77	2019-06-19 01:06:05	TheOneTrueL	AITA for wanting to leave my sick mother?	"So, long story short: my mom struggles with depression and panic attacks. For the past 4 years, her only income is my father's allowance and me and my brother's money. 

She struggled a lot to raise me and she really really did everything she could to raise me through poverty. Now Im 21, I have a nice job and I'm graduating. 

However, this is not the only side of the relationship. She lives only and exclusively to me, so she sees me as her only confident, love, support and everything else you can imagine. She really demands a lot of love and care that I simply cannot give and I don't even have this type of feeling anymore. Most of the time I feel like she treats me like a father like and (don't joke that's serious) lover-like, really demanding affection. 

I simply can't take it anymore. Everytime I'm home, I'm miserable. She is always telling me how much she needs me and how she misses me and how her sickness keeps her from going on. I pay for her medicines but I just can't be this emotional rock she needs. I wanna build my own life, away from her. 

I still wanna help her with money, but move away and reduce contact for like once a week. I feel like my mind needs it and I've been struggling myself to fight depression due to living here. I wanna go but I don't have the courage, I don't wanna be a monster. 

TLDR: my mom has depression, demands a lot from me, I feel like I'm going down the same path of depression if I don't get out of this house."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2aioa	2019-06-19 01:04:39		WIBTA for cutting a friend due to guilt by association	"Met this friend (17) in April at an event. A guy around 22-25 yrs old approached us confusing me with someone else, I corrected him and he moved on to flirting with my friend. My ride home arrived, we said our goodbyes to each other and the last thing I saw before I left was them kissing while he asked her how old she was and she lied saying she was 19. The next morning she texts me telling me what happened, apparently he still took her to his place but he found out her real age and got pissed so she had to sleep on the floor and the next morning she had to walk home. He unfriends her off Fb but he still keeps me added. This weekend there was another event at the same place with the same people me and my friend spend the whole time together but when I ran into the guy again he did not greet me and was passive aggressive when I asked if he was in line for the bathroom but was greeting everyone else. Saw a mutual friend of me and the guy and she just gave me an uncomfortable smile and wave assuming because the friend who lied was right behind me, I felt like everyone that knew what happened was acting weird towards me and excluding me from their conversations. My theory is that if everyone outside this guy’s friend group were to find out about what happened it could easily be twisted into making him a predator since she’s young, he’s still pissed about it so he’s taking it out on me too making me guilty by association for still hanging around her. 

So WIBTA if I were to cut her off over this?"		1	0

c2agxd	2019-06-19 01:00:13		WIBTA if I went to my son’s high school graduation? I was not a part of his life for a long time.	"I had my son “Dan” when I was 19. I wasn’t ready to be a father and his mother, my girlfriend at the time, ended up mostly raising him. Dan lived with her and her family growing up. Me and his mom didn’t stay together long after he was born. 

I was an addict for the first few years of Dan’s life and it took me a few years after that to start to really get my shit together. During this time I was in and out of Dan’s life. I admit I was a shitty father.

I tried to buy his love as the years went on and I would only end up seeing him a few times a year because of my selfishness. 

When Dan turned 16, I really tried to connect with him and his interests but it hasn’t gone as well as I’d hoped. I tried to connect with his interests but he had been acting removed from me and his mom has told me that he was acting out and drinking and getting into fights. 

He didn’t seem interested in spending time with me. Despite this, I haven’t given up and I’m going to keep trying to repair our relationship. 

It’s Dan’s high school graduation next week. I want to go and see my son graduate (he’s gotten a college scholarship to a good college) but I’m worried that my presence would be unwanted. 

I haven’t talked to Dan yet about it but there’s no way I could miss my son’s graduation. I would never forgive myself. 

So WIBTA if I went to the graduation?"		1	0
c2agq4	2019-06-19 00:59:36	Purple_Cod	AITA for not talking to my parents/family?	"When I am around my friends I'm a pretty gregarious person and I love to talk and have conversations, but when I'm around my family I'm a completely different person.

When I'm around my family I'm almost completely quiet, speaking only when I'm asked questions and generally not giving lengthy answers to those questions, almost never initiating conversations, etc. This makes my family and especially my parents very upset with me, especially after they noticed that I'm not like this with my friends. They especially hate that I avoid talking to them on the telephone.

The thing is, I'm not trying to make them angry, I'm just profoundly uncomfortable around all of them.  I avoid their phone calls  because I hate listening to them ramble on when there is nothing left to say, and I just have to sit there in silence. I feel immense anxiety when I'm in any social situation with them and I genuinely can't think of anything that I want to say to them. But this doesn't stop me from feeling like I'm acting kind of dickish for being so quiet in their presence."	No A-holes here	0	0

c2aew6	2019-06-19 00:54:50	Vilayb	AITA for telling my brother to shut up in a family dinner	"It's been a couple of days I've been back to my family after 2 years abroad. I really missed them and was truly happy to be with them again.

But since I've been back my brother has been quite rude to my sister and started to act the same way towards me. During that periode of time I've been trying to be as nice as possible and solve the situation the best way possible when he was acting badly.
When he is being rude my sister tries as hard as she can to defend herself but my mother doesn't interact and let the situation gets worse.

The last day, after helping him working on his car I cooked for the entire family by myself. During dinner he was complaining because the food wasn't the way he wanted it to be, I remained still, after seeing me saying nothing he said ""great, now he's sulking!"" at the same time my sister tried to change the subject by talking about a singer she likes, my brother laughed and told her that this artist is just a commercial singer for teenagers and it is stupid to enjoy that kind of music. Silence...
He looked at me ""still sulking?!"".
""It's not a way to talk to people you know.."" I answered.
""What!?"".
""When you see someone embarrassed or annoyed you can't talk like this and hope to make the situation better"".
""It's not my fault, it's just you who is sensitive and always sulking"".
At that time I couldn't take it anymore a told him to shut up and leave everyone in peace instead of being always rude and not even care about people's feelings. After that he was furious,he left the table, packed his things and left the house.

My mother talked to him in private but I heard her saying I was too sensitive and it's not his fault but mine, she is now annoyed at me.

I regret the situation ended up like this, espacially for my mother who isn't seeing her 3 children together very often but I really had enough of his behaviour.

Thankfully my sister thanked me for what I did and told me it was the right thing to say.

c2adzz	2019-06-19 00:52:32	im_tired_and_hungry	AITA For Telling my Best Friend of Almost 10 Years that I Never Want Anything to Do With Her Again?	"Long time lurker, and on mobile. English is my first language, so I have no excuse.


I'll be referring to her as BFF from now on because BF makes me think boyfriend, and I don't want any confusion.

So BFF and I have been inseparable for years. We met in 7th grade when she helped me after this entitled b**** was picking on me for my glasses, although the frames WERE awful lol. We found we had a lot in common and just started hanging out. We're both bisexual, I lean towards guys and she leans towards girls. She was the first person I came out to.

Starting about 4 years ago, BFF would ditch me all the time for her SO. She left me hanging at the cinema at a very sad movie so she could go to the same one with her girlfriend at different cinema. And that's only one instance.

BFF was really big part of my support system when my depression was really bad. Although, whenever I really needed her she wasn't there. When she was in a rough place, I was always there for her. That ended up being a common theme in our friendship.

Senior year, BFF stopped coming to school for about a week. She wasn't answering any texts or calls and I was crazy worried. BFF texted me once, and 5 AM on a Wednesday morning, to tell me she was air lifted to the hospital because of TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) and she ghosted me for 3 weeks afterward and ignored me every time I tried to wish her well or see how she was doing.

Everytime BFF was in a 'rough place' (her words, they meant anything from a deep depressive episode to the flu) she would ghost me and I sometimes I didn't know if she was alive or not because of the TSS incident.

This would happen all the time, sometimes for months. She ignored me when a close friend died in a boat accident, she ignored me on my birthday, she ignored me when my father started drinking again after 5 years sober, yet she expected me to drop everything for her.

It was after a long and hard semester at college that BFF wanted me to drive home, about 3 hours, and be at her side and doing things for her that I snapped. I told her how mad I was that she never apologized for anything and how she was never there when I needed her. BFF told me she would be driving up a few weeks later and we could talk and clear the air, and then she stood me up.

I told her I didn't want to see her, or have anything to do with her, because she was selfish and rude and I couldn't handle it anymore.

But I can't get over the good times. BFF bought us tickets to our favorite band for my birthday, supported me when I came out, got me a beautiful purple bracelet that had a stone just the right length for me to fidget with because it helps my ADD to mess with things when I work. There were times when she was a great friend and we could just hang out and talk for hours, but I don't feel like it makes up for all the times she was a bad friend.

c2acp1	2019-06-19 00:49:00	Medical-Marinara1	AITA for going off on my friend for refusing to seek employment?	"Hello, moral arbiters of reddit. A little background; my (24) friend (24) leads a very privileged life. He grew up INSANELY wealthy and hasn't ever had to work for anything in his life. 

Once we got out of high school, my friend didnt pursue any further education and just stuck to working part time minimum wage jobs (retail, customer service, etc.)  after high school. Come 8 months ago, he got terminated from his position at a used car lot. He has been unemployed since. I started to suggest jobs for him and even offered to help him look or put in a good word for him at my company that I work at as an engineer at and he said something along the lines of 'No thanks man. I dont think I'll need to start looking for a job for the next 5 or so years.' He plans to live off of his grandparents for as long as he can. 

I snapped when I heard this. Years of bitterness and jealousy came out all at once and I told him 'Doing nothing but playing video games and jacking off all day isnt a legitimate way to live life.' I told him 'Stop being a loser.' And I told him 'If you ever wants to see boobs that arent on a computer screen ever again, you need to grow up and contribute to society.'

He got super butthurt and now I feel like a dick for hurting my childhood friends feelings. At the end of the day it really isnt my business whether or not he works. His lifestyle just infuriates me. Why does he get to sleep in late every day and not contribute to the world while I have to work a 40 hour week? 

TLDR; I hurt my rich, privileged friend's feelings because he refuses to find work or better himself in any way and I went off on him for it."	Asshole	0	0

I had been planning on buying my mom a phone for a couple months and my gf had expressed interest in wanting to switch to iPhone from her galaxy. I’m a developer and sometime need an Android for testing so thought this was perfect. Deal goes through and she needs a day to switch over stuff and etc. Today I ask her for the phone because I figured she’d be done but she tells me she let her coworker borrow it because her phone broke. She could tell I was not happy and added that it was just til this weekend. We started arguing after asking if it would turn into longer than this weekend with her saying possibly. I told her that I was pissed because I considered it my phone the moment I got her a new phone. She didn’t think this was the understanding. She thought that she was just getting the phone for free because I had always planned on buying my mom a phone and that the galaxy was going to be used sparingly by me. I told her that I more saw the cost of the 1 phone divided by the 2 phones we actually got. She added that her co worker who needs the phone is a single mother and and has a mother with dementia and that she didn’t feel bad at all for doing something nice. I told her I didn’t need the sob story because there are a million sob stories in my family alone. She told me great and you don’t give a fuck to which I said you don’t think I give a fuck? And walked away to write this because I do care about my family a ton but you can’t save everyone which is why I’m upset. I feel like she just gave that phone away. I told her I should just take back her current phone then out of anger and now she says she feels like now I’m just going to hold it over her head. I did try to apologize because I don’t want her to feel like I’m controlling her but that damage was done.

I know I’m probably the asshole but I still feel fucked over.

Edit: idk how i forgot to mention this... I told her that when getting g her the new phone I would use her old one for testing and she agreed."	Asshole	0	0
c2abyx	2019-06-19 00:46:55	gabbygirl23	AITA for insisting my boyfriend stop seeing his ex’s family?	"My boyfriend recently shared that he likes to visit his ex girlfriend’s niece’s and nephews twice a year and being the kids presents. He considers those kids his family since they have referred to him as Uncle X during the 10 yr relationship he had with his ex.  I feel uncomfortable with his attachment to those kids and their mom because they are connected to his ex. I told him and asked him why he couldn’t let go and just be content with seeing how they grow up through postings on Facebook. He is connected with them there. He got angry and told me “You are not going to make me cut people out of my life!”  I’m connected to an ex on Facebook and I am fine with seeing them and their family updates in their posts without any desire to visit any of them. I just feel like it’s a bit disrespectful to our own relationship at worst and presents a barrier in our own relationship at least.  He and I have been together for 5 months and I don’t picture him getting close to my family as long as he continues his attachment to family of his ex.  To be fair, he has said I’d be welcome to join on those visits which is still feels a bit weird for me.  AITA???

UPDATE with a bit more info.  I’m seeing the comments about me being insecure and that may be true. He and I are not connected on Facebook and never have video called yet he is connected to others in those ways. I suppose my insecurities may stem from some ways I’d hope to feel connected with my boyfriend and is just not happening.  he recently shared in recent weeks that he loves me yet he yet hasnt shown interest to connect with me in these other ways that others may learn that I exist in his life.   So yes, while I’m happy together with him in many ways, I’m also feeling insecure in other ways."	Asshole	0	0

c2aals	2019-06-19 00:43:18		AITA for getting mad at my brother for not being me to Best Buy?	"This is something that happened a couple months back but iv bean thinking about it lately and would like some closure about who’s in the fault here. I’m not gonna lie I’m pretty bias on this so I can’t confirm my explanation of what happened will be 100% objective. 


So a while back battlefield V went on sale with a slick steel case at Best Buy and I was already considering getting the game so this sold me on it. I really enjoyed BF1 and after 6 months I was pretty confident the game would have enough content to keep me entertained. Anyway I asked my older brother if he could bring me to bestbuy after school one day and he agreed. Now for context I waited an hour almost everyday after school for him to get out of track so I didn’t really think that I was asking to much of him to bring me to bestbuy one day, I don’t have my driving license yet either so I couldn’t drive myself. Now we were planning on going to best buy the next day but after track he told me we would be out an extra hour because he and his friends decided to go nerf hunting (it’s an activity at our school that I’m not even gonna try to explain) I was a bit annoyed by this but eh whatever it’s an extra hour and I will be getting battlefield V anyway so I didn’t care much.

2 hours later we finally drop his friends off, I confront him about it to which he even agreed that he didn’t want to stay out so long but hen goes on a massive rant about how he just couldn’t say no to them and how hard it would be to that. Now his friends aren’t assholes so I couldn’t imagine them getting mad at him for saying after an hour that he’s done with the thing and just drop them off. He then proceeds to ramble on about how much he tries to please everyone and how much work he does (I know going to the bank every 3rd day for 15 minutes is really freaking hard work) now it was already 6:00 and we were low on gas anyway so we decided to skip bestbuy that day. 

The next day we had to get home early anyway so we couldn’t go but for the next 2 weeks or so he couldn’t be bothered to take me to best buy once. He didn’t even really acknowledge me asking. I kindly asked him if we could go and he just laughed and said no before changing subjects. Eventually the game went off sale and I’ll admit that I was kinda an asshole to him making snide remarks and being kinda harsh but I was honestly really pissed. Not just because I couldn’t pick the game up anymore but just because of how little he cared to justify his actions. I told him about it and how pissed I was and even he didn’t try to justify it. He just kinda shrugged and didn’t think about it."		1	0

c2a9mi	2019-06-19 00:40:36	RTSF_Official	AITA For Lying To My BF about my sexuality?	"For some context, X is a friend.BF is boyfriend and we’ve been together for about 3 years now. 

I was raised in a hyper Christian household, so my recent years I’ve been trying to find myself and what I like. I’m currently closeted bisexual and have been for about a year, although I’ve made jokes about it with my friends like joking about finding a female character sexy or something. So all of my friends minus one are convinced I’m straight because of my jokes and whatnot. However, X  has made it clear that he sees through my jokes and was the only one to do so. 

Anyway, a few months ago, I came to BF with the idea that I might actually find female characters attractive. The idea was that if he took it well, I’d come out to him. However, he didn’t, and I kinda rolled the idea back into a joke an assured him that I was in no way bi. 

So today my friends and I are in a group chat playing FMK with random characters, and then X happens to say ‘you swing both ways anyway’ in conversation, my boyfriend sees this later and is extremely frustrated about it. 

So AITA for not telling him earlier? In my defense, I wasn’t aware of my sexuality when we got together, and it doesn’t really change anything to me. We’re already together at this point.


Edit: I’ll point this out again. At the time that we got together, I considered myself straight. I didn’t consider myself bi until about a year ago. I haven’t deliberately hid this from him the whole time."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2a7t0	2019-06-19 00:35:36	Deadbabybunny0	AITA for not acknowledging my friends' fake marriage?	"Little background. Me(23F) and my friends both 23 M and F have been friends since 5th grade. Let's call them Jane and Fred. We grew up together, although Jane and I were more close.

After we graduated high school, I realized that Fred had crush on Jane and after talking to him about it, I realized he was afraid to ask her out. So, I decided to help them both to come clean about their feelings. It ended up with them being together. I was really happy for them and felt proud that I helped them a tad to get to that relationship.

Now, it has been 3 years and they have decided to move in together.However, Jane told me that they were getting married and I got excited. They stated from the beginning that they didn't want to spend the money on the wedding or any kind of ceremony, which I totally understood. They decided to buy an apartment and start living together.

Although, yesterday, Jane texted me and said that she got married. I was surprised but I kinda expected for them to do it suddenly without extra attention. I asked her when did they do it or how, just sign the papers or have the little ceremony in the church? She said ""Neither, we're just moving in together, we have the rings and he will move his stuff at my place this weekend."" I was not expecting it and said, well that's not really how it works, so basically you are just living together as a couple, that doesn't qualify for marriage. She got upset and said ""It's not about the papers or technicality, we are ready for the new chapter in our lives and we are moving onto the next level as a couple. For me he is my husband and for him  I am his wife, that's enough. Just because government isn't aware of it, doesn't mean it's not real. If I introduce him as my husband to someone, they will acknowledge him as such."" I was kind of shocked, because for me this is absolutely delusional. Maybe I'm being ignorant or missing something but as far as I know, married status doesn't come when you just feel like being someone's husband or wife, it's a legal document that states it. When I explained this, she got more triggered and said that they will not pay government extra taxes. For some reason she thinks that she has to do it when you formally get married, which is not true. (We're not in US). 

They said I was being illogical and crazy and couldn't believe I didn't understand it. When I realized that it was getting out of hand, I just said this isn't worth to make us fight, you can call each other whatever you feel like, I have no say in it or a right to do so, but why do you expect me to accept your beliefs? We obviously have different opinions, so let's just agree to disagree.

They think I'm being rude for going against them when their family and our mutual friends agree with them and recognize them as a married couple, just because they are going to live together and call each other husband and wife. I'm really confused. 

Am I being an asshole?

Edit: I see there are mixed opinions. I'll just add that I clearly stated that I'm not going to oppose them nor underline my view on their status everytime it comes up. I just said that it's just not how I view the marriage. But they can call each other whatever they want. 

I personally don't put too much weight on marriage itself, papers or any type of ceremony doesn't make the relationship any better or worse. I'm just saying, in order to call someone your wife or husband, there should be a legal document stating it. However, I'm not bombarding them with my views and trying to label them as anything."

c2a7jv	2019-06-19 00:34:51	AnthonyRg	AITA if I want or push a little my SO to learn to drive?	"Pretty simple situation.

I have been with my gf since highschool, almost 7 years now. We were together when I learned and started to drive, and since then I wanted to teach her, and she wanted too.

However, as we grew older, now in college, like 3 years ago I told her that she needed to learn to drive, mostly because she constantly moves by walking and public transport, and sometimes in late hours, this being dangerous, and more here in Mexico. Her parents would have no problem lending their cars to her, maybe even buying her one, but this hasn't happened since she has showed no interest. And maybe even for an emergency that requires her to drive for her family or even for a friend or me. On the other hand, I also wanted her to drive because sometimes I just want her to when we go out, or if she wants to go out or wants me to go to her house, she comes for me or just get to me, not because I am lazy or want to be treated like a king, I just don't want to drive sometimes, and it would be cool if, when she stays late in my house, she just go to her house instead of me driving her and coming back to my house, but this is not the principal reason obviously.

She got kind of mad, and it turned into a serious fight, she stating that I only want that she learns because I am tired of driving her to every place she needs to and I just want my own commodity.

This was the first ""fight"", a time later when we touched the theme again, she got mad again but now stated that she is scared to drive, and she gets too stressed when she tries to learn, in the end she said she just don't want to.

We've had this discussion like 4 or 5 times over the 3 years it started, it's not a big problem and doesn't affects our relationship, but when I remember it, or when she needs to use an Uber or asks me to go get her o take her to a place (which I always gladly do) I get pissed off, because she's wasting a resource that could improve her life and activities, just because she can't overcome a somewhat simple stress or fear.

He had a restraining order on the mother of his daughter. Which I also didn't know about,I was young and dumb.  His ex began to harass me and stalk me. Even after we broke up, this woman was still stalking me. My ex and I broke up when we lost our second daughter at 25 weeks.  His ex would follow me on the city bus telling people I murdered my own baby.  I had to move across the state to get away from her. She still harassed me online through Facebook.  I would block her and she would create other accounts.  She would also steal photos of me and my daughter.  She created an entire account being me and cat fishing guys. 

Continuously blocking her has worked for years.  I have since been married for 8 years and have had 2 boys since then.  My oldest daughter is my ex's and he is court ordered to see her once a month.  Today my ex's baby mama contacted me. She said she wanted my daughter to spend time with her daughter.  My daughter is 9 and her daughter is 10. I told her she needed to contact our daughter's father and him and I can discuss it. She proceeds to tell me I'm a fucking monster keeping sisters apart.  That her daughter is now crying because I won't let her see her little sister.  I told her I doubt her daughter is completely heart broken and to talk to our ex. My ex  contacts me saying now psycho won't let him see their daughter. He is upset with me for saying anything to her. But for years I've walked on eggshells for this psycho.

c2a58e	2019-06-19 00:28:38	throwaway-getawayAD	AITA for cutting off a friend for not getting me a birthday present?	"My 19th birthday was earlier this month and my friend, we’ll call him Dennis, didn’t get me a birthday present. This isn’t a big deal on its own, most of my friends didn’t get me a birthday present, we’re all students who don’t work so I understand how money can be tight.

However, earlier in the year, 3 months before Dennis’s birthday, he kept hounding me about buying his birthday present. It started because of an offhand comment I made about buying something for his birthday and he kept on it. I got messages from him every other week and when it got closer to his birthday it was almost daily. I told him he’d have to wait because I’m a uni student but he wouldn’t stop, I had to use some of my student loan to buy him something instead of waiting for when I had spare money (only £15 but still). 

So, when it was Dennis’s birthday I bought him a present after being asked non stop. And then on my birthday I didn’t hear anything from him. He messaged me to say happy birthday but that’s it. Later I was out with my a couple of friends for a birthday treat. Dennis is in our group but he couldn’t make it because he was at a festival. A couple of friends got me presents and I complained to them about how Dennis never got me anything, I don’t mind that most of my friends didn’t get me a present, like I said money’s tight and we’re students, but it’s just that he wouldn’t stop asking me. And they said I was justified to be upset and I should message him about my upset. 

I messaged him and he apologised and said money was tight, and I said it was fair enough because I understand that money’s tight for all of us. But later he messaged me saying that he wasn’t happy because it looked like I was talking shit about him behind his back with the gang, which I was and I told him I was because I was upset at the time. Then he kind of went off on me and we had a little argument. He was saying he was short on money but, like I said, he was at a festival. And he was just making plans in the group chat with the others for a £60+ trip to a sport event, and he constantly spends money on DVDs so I told him that and he said he used gift cards which I find very hard to believe. He also got mad at me saying he doesn’t get parent money like everyone else in the group, implying that it’s ok for him to ask for lots from my parents? 

He last messaged me saying how he can’t be bothered to argue about this and wants us to make up. I don’t really want to cause I don’t feel like he’s been serious about this. But I’m quite an argumentative person so maybe I am being unreasonable? So really I want to know am I the asshole? 

TLDR: friend bugs me for months before his birthday to buy him a birthday present. Doesn’t get anything for me for my birthday and gets angry with me when I “call him out” (privately)"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

We are 100% just friends. Ive never hid that I talk to her. I do not flirt or talk about super serious things with her. Shes just one of the people I talk to (text) while bored at work.

Each time she brings this up I tell her that I trust her and I don't care who she talks to. I fully trust that she loves me and she's not going to cheat on me. And that I will never try to dictate who she talks to, and I will not be in a relationship my partner thinks they can choose my friends.

This situation is made worse by the one time she suddenly demanded to see my conversation with this girl and I said no. I told her I dont want us to be in a relationship where we are snooping eachothers convos or interrogating eachother about who we talk to.

Her claim is that I am being incredibly disrespectful and that everyone woman in the world would ""kick me to the curb over this behavior"".

So, I'm a 17yo brazilian and my 22yo sister's boyfriend is coming from Turkey for the first time to visit. My sister has the smaller room and I have the biggest room in the house and a bed a little smaller than a queen-size one. The thing is: my sister wants me to change room with her for the next month and 10 days, but I don't want to give it to her.

The thing is, I'm a person who spends a lot of time in my room, drawing, using the computer and stuff like this and I also value a lot my own personal space. I was prepared to let them sleep here for, like, 2 weeks or something, but not more than that and I already feel bad by the mere thought of trading rooms.

c2a2dx	2019-06-19 00:21:01	mizbrightside	AITA for cutting contact with a girl who has autism?	"This year, I \[20F\] lived with my best friend \[20M\] who was dating a girl \[19F\] on the autism spectrum. She is clearly a high functioning and intelligent person, and in our one-on-one interactions, was quite pleasant and a good conversationalist. From what I understand, she struggles most with social nuance. 

I enjoyed her company for the first two months she and my roommate dated. I considered her a friend. However, she started tracking his phone, needed to have his Google calendar, and had to text him constantly. She would have meltdowns and stage crises to get his attention if he left her alone for twenty minutes or more. She would also text me at two in the morning asking where he was if she didn't get an immediate reply.

I spoke to my roommate about my concerns with some of her possessive behavior. She found out that I said these things and began spreading nasty rumors around the school about me. She was in theater and left her mic on at a rehearsal--so it picked up her saying some extremely harsh things (ex. that I was a bitch, clingy to my roommate, and had issues.) Those who heard it addressed it with me and I was able to dispel them since I generally have a good reputation among my classmates. I stopped talking to her completely.

She noticed and asked me what was wrong. I said that I knew she had been saying unkind things about me and didn't like how she treated my best friend. She apologized and asked if I wanted to be friends again, and as politely as I could, I let her know that it wasn't a good idea for either of our sanity to stay close to each other anymore. I fell out with my best friend because of it and we're not talking anymore. I moved out at the end of the year.

My mom and others who I've told about the situation think that her being on the spectrum explains much of her behavior and that I should have been more patient with her--or at least tried to be more understanding. AITA for cutting her off?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

We're 19 but have been in really rough situations, so he's joining the air force. We got married so that he could go in, and we have everything we need for him to join but  he still smokes weed. He smokes a lot of weed. Obviously he needs to pass a drug test to join. He'll say he's stopping one day and then smoke the next day. When I say something about it he gets mad and says I don't have a right to say anything since it was his decision and I'm not the one going in and that he will stop when he is ready and I need to trust him, which is true, but is just frustrating since we got married so that he could join the air force, and the fact he keeps saying he will stop then just does it the next day.

c2a20t	2019-06-19 00:20:05	TSthrowawayjeet	AITA for saying it's a shame a characters gay?	"Me and a friend were watching a new tv show on netflix . Early on I developed a liking to a character considered him very much eye candy. Like the rest of the characters I assumed he was straight until proven otherwise. This wasn't far off since the characters engage in frequent sexual relations with the opposite sex. it's just a tv show and I know this, but it's just something me and my friend like to point out while watching together.

&#x200B;

We got to an episode and It turns out he is indeed homosexual. I said ""such a shame he's gay"" I didn't mean that it's a shame BECAUSE he's gay but because  I am a straight female not sexually attracted to gay males. So even as TV show characters it's deleted my little crush I had developed. Before this episode me and my friend (who's a straight female) were just joking around about liking the characters and it was never taken seriously.

&#x200B;

I am not homophobic, I didn't mind that he's gay. but I know this is  just a TV show that's why I was so confused as to my friends reaction. She knows I'm not homophobic but she started getting defensive and telling me about the plights of homosexual representation in shows and their struggles and pulled up an article on twitter about those two women who got assaulted on a subway for being lesbians. AITA for saying this?

&#x200B;

Edit: To give more information, I wasn't upset for the fact they're gay. And I assumed that based on the nature of the show itself. The character was very flirty and touchy feeling with the females. While I know this is not 100% determinate of one's sexuality, in the tv world it's heavily implied.

&#x200B;

He also smokes meth. Hes always smoked it, but he goes to work and lives a ""normal life""
I say normal loosely. He wont admit to it. It's like hes lying to himself. 
Well he constantly puts me down about smoking weed, even embarassing me infront of our family. Really humiliating me and saying rude things. It's a daily thing to him. Hes always telling me all I do is smoke. Sure I may smoke but that doesnt make me a bad person it's just a little pot. 
It's gotten to the point where he makes his snide remarks about smoking and I call him out about tweaking. He usually just ignores it. 
One time he made me so mad I broke all his pipes infront of his mom and called him a dirty lying tweaker. 
Am i the asshole for responding to my dad in such a way?  I just cant justify my dad being on hard drugs yet I'M the problem.

"We met and went through undergraduate school together when I was an emotional wreck (I still am). We both pursued the field of medicine and were lab partners and everything. I relied on this man and I loved him. In retrospect it was a rather one-sided relationship, I needed saving and he was the saviour. However, I almost think he needs to be the saviour and needs to be the better one.

He got into medical school last year and ever since has been on top of the world. I almost want to say arrogance but I hate talking trash about him, but he loves talking about properties he has bought with friends on a his line of credit, how he'll profit 40k to me, etc. When we hang out, I listen and make eye contact but when I start talking he'll often get on his phone. I almost get a sense that he doesn't respect me as I do him especially since he got into medical school. It seems all I ever hear from him are his successes. All I need to hear is a little failure, I need to hear something other than how everything is going right.

Furthermore, in almost every way important to being a young man, he is better than me. More athletic, got into the ""best"" most ""socially acceptable"" job as in physician, and was raised in a family where he was the center of the attention.

This past year I have lived alone and learned a lot about myself and taken some steps to try and move my life in a direction I've always wanted that isn't medicine (medicine is in the back of my mind, I think I have always been interested and I have an MCAT score in the high 90th percentile that will last me another 4 years so it's not off the books) and when I recently hung out with him again I reverted back to my old depressed self that needed saving and was reminded how great he was and how he succeeded at everything we tried to do together. He is a year older and has always gotten things first, always done things first, and even if I do better than him he is never impressed or jealous like I am of him. It's pathetic on my part, I know this, but I just want to see that from him. He has such self-confidence and I have none and I realize that is the answer to this, he isn't jealous because he is happy for me and my successes, but I am weaker than he is and I just can't handle it like he does.

AITA for finding it hard to spend time with him? I held back tears on the drive back because I couldn't help breaking down in front of him again, giving him the power, showing I need him, especially with the current power dynamic of our friendship."	No A-holes here	1	0

His gf is organizing the party, it's going to be just friends and family at his mom's house and a pretty friendly atmosphere. As a joke, but not really, I want to buy him a globe as a present. So WIBTA if I did that? He's pretty adamant about it being a flat earth and he will probably launch into some diatribe about his beliefs so I think I already know the answer, but hey that's my sense of humor and I also could see it as hilarious. Thoughts?

Edit: This is absolutely 100% not a troll or s/post whatsoever. I'm sorry some people have nothing better to do than to Spost or troll people, but that is not the case at all. If I didn't care about his friendship I would link to his FB so you can all see for yourself but I am not going to do that. I am friends with him because I know his whole family, I am friends with all of them from his mom to his uncles, brother, cousins and even his kids are friends with my kids. Our friendship is strong and he's not going to be butthurt and in his feelings over this he will tell me to Foff, maybe punch me in the arm and then move on. Anyways it's a small minority that think I shouldn't do it and that have no sense of humor, I am going to get him a real gift, not just the gag gift globe. And thanks for all the support and the people that still have a sense of humor in this day and age. It will be done and I will update, so click that save button or use the remind bot, party is Saturday so check back on Sunday. Peace, love and chicken grease, I'm out for now.

Update: I didn't video the unveiling, but it was funny AF! He was a little bit irritated about it, but he took it with humor he said who the F got me this a couple times to the crowd, I couldn't keep from busting up laughing and fessing up to doing it, he was like fuck u bud, lol'ing, then I gave him some wax and a blunt as the real gift, his mom gave him shit about being FE, and we all kinda clowned on him for a few mins,he took it great, talked shit back & his one conspiracy theory cousin was on his side, they pushed back a little bit but we all just joked and laughed and got on with the party. 10/10 highly recommend it to anyone who has a FE friend who has a sense of humor."

"My family (Me, my wife, and her brother and his wife),  took a beach trip last week to celebrate the excruciating heat and beginning of a grueling summer. We were having a fun day, it wasn't too crowded and we found a perfect spot away from too many people. A couple hours in, my wife and I had to use the restroom and took a trip together to the public bathrooms. 

Now I'm not sure about her, but I'll be honest with you all and say it bluntly. I had to poop.

Once we got to the restrooms, she went into the women's room and I went into the men's. I immediately noticed something weird. There were four stalls, and none of them had a door. Three of them were empty and one man was sitting down staring right at me as I walked past. We made eye contact. 

I don't even consider myself a private person but I did NOT want to poop with a bunch of other dudes able to stare at me. 

I walked back out and when I saw my wife I told her what was up. She thought it was weird too that there weren't any doors on the stalls and said that there WERE doors in the woman's room. Then she said I should just go into the woman's room and while I was hesitant at first, nature was calling and I had to do what I had to do. 

Cut to me walking out and washing my hands, a woman with two little kids is standing at the sink and gives me a dirty look. Obviously I knew why but I tried to be quick and run out since I knew I didn't belong. 

Later in the day the same woman walked past out blanket area and said loudly to who I assume was her husband ""that's the pervert"". 

My wife and I could only laugh about it but I still wonder if it makes me an asshole to use the women's restroom simply because I was being a baby about not having privacy while pooping."	No A-holes here	0	0

Little bit of a backstory: I (18f) have PTSD from being a victim of numerous sexual assaults, abuses, etc. Which, my parents know about. 

My parents do this thing where whenever they walk past me, the poke me somewhere, which tends to aggravate (idk how else to explain it) my PTSD as well as my anxiety. 

I always try to tell my parents when I'm having a bad mental health day. I told my mom earlier today that it was a bad mental health day for me and asked her politely to leave me be in my room for today. And aside from the couple ""just checking in"" Texts I've gotten from her, which are normal on these days, she's obliged and left me alone. 

When I go out for supper, I have to stop in the kitchen to put my water bottles from my room in the sink. As we pass each other she pokes my stomach. Which puts me into full blown fight or flight because of my anxiety. 

I kinda blew up at her and yelled at her and ran in my room in tears. 

After supper (I'm assuming) my dad comes in my room and tells me that I didn't have to blow up at her and now she was crying (trying to guilt trip me into apologizing, which he normally does). I basically told him everything verbatim that I typed in here but still claims that I didn't have to blow up at her.

I later was informed by a waitress that the kid was there because that was his Make A Wish wish......

"So my wife and I have two kids (2 years old that isn't biologically mine and 5 months old that is) and for the first year we were together she was receiving a welfare check because she couldn't work due to having a baby. When our second son was born we were registered as common law which resulted in her being terminated from welfare. Since then I have been working 7 days a week to pay for rent and our bills and she's been using the monthly mother's allowance for diapers and the like. Essentially, I pay for everything including her phone. So today she gets a check in the mail of $5000. I've been struggling to get the money together to save up for my driver's license, so she initially offered to pay it for me, which is about $830. When I get home from work today I asked her if she was serious. She said she has to think about it, so I got pretty upset and called her out for leaning on me to pay for everything while she is totally content with putting all of this money into savings. I accused her for taking me for granted and being unappreciative and I told her that I feel like I'm entitled to some of that money considering she didn't work a single hour for it and called her out because she's going to have her license and a car paid for by her family so she gets to ride that grace while I bust my ass to cover our expenses.

I'm fairly young, in my early teens, and still live at home.

So when I ask if I can buy something with my money (not a loan or anything, money I have in my wallet that I'd give to my dad because it's his card connected to the Xbox) in a videogame that I admittedly have spent a lot of money on, (again all of it was mine) that's around ten dollars and she declines even after I remind her of the deal she made with me, am I the asshole for being mad? I know she has a problem with virtual purchases because you don't get anything material, even after I came up with the *amazing* comparison of would you rather have some Lego thing or a big block of plastic it's the same ammount of plastic could even be all the same colors but you'd rather have the Lego, right? So it doesn't matter what materially you get it's what enjoyment you get out of it. Well when I remind her of the deal she made she just says ""Well then I'm going back on my word""

Also nsfw warning, im not gonna tag it as im not going into detail.

DB = Dickhead boy

DG = Dead girlfriend

Me = Me

10 or so months ago I downloaded a dating app, and i matched with this guy, DB, we start to talk, and i quite quickly start to like him, and it seems requited 2, he asked me to be his girlfriend before we even meet, and after only knowing each other for 2 days, we where to meet the following Saturday.

Here's the plan for the date, we meet at the train station, we go eat some food, and go back to my house.

so Saturday comes, and it seemingly going well but he is rather nervous and quite, i wanted him to talk to him, but i figured he might open up later on, we kissed, we ate maccies, and now we where walking back to my house.

Then he made some excuse and ran off. Ngl that memory is still scaring till this day. Anyway I walk after DB, when i get to the station, i see him, sitting on that bench, feeling abit hurt, i scream hey dickhead at him, now i believe that was abit unwarranted, but he looked at the watch, and the upcoming train times, and runs off.

He tells me after that he was just scared, and also was scared my parents would be home, not cause he thought stuff was gonna happen, in fact the only thing he really said that date was dirty stuff, and he admitted that he was hoping for it, just he felt alot of pressure. Thats totally fine. I messed up there.

Anyway months go by and here he appears again, and he messages me again, we get on very well and i start liking DB, he tells me we should meet up soon and starts being dirty with me, sexting me, saying that if i loved him i send him pictures 2, so i do.

But then he ghosts me, completely vanishes and blocks me, im left all confused and hurt. I labbled him as a dickhead and tried to move on. But I struggle with out closure.

A month goes by and he messages me again. DB is trying to get me to meet, saying how much he loved me and promised he wouldn't ever hurt me again. I struggle hard to trust him, and eventually stop responding to his messages to meet, but then the other day he messages me saying hes in my town today and tomorrow, and that we should meet up.Feeling rather lonely, i go and meet him. And he shows up. we where talking while walking through a Forrest near my home and he starts being abit cheaky, but this guy is like jesus to me remember, so im weak to it, and long story short stuff happens.

c29rz9	2019-06-18 23:53:46		AITA for being open about how I feel like I was manipulated into bringing bfs gma to her coastal home where she needs to be cared for and wasting my vacation	"So I'm in college and have a week and a half for summer break. I really just need to relax because it's been a rough term and a lot has happened in my personal life that's worn me out. Bf's aunt usually cares for his gma but is going to Ireland and his uncle who was supposed to come down and care for gma instead messed up the scheduling. So there was really no one to care for her. Bf and I were asked to care for her and of course we said yes. Well it was suggested by the aunt we bring gma to her house on the coast and it was insinuated that it'd be lovely and like a vacation and that the weather is supposed to be like 75 all week. 
So bf and I drive over 3 hours to bring gma out to the coast and we find that her house is old, stuffy, smelly, and just generally uncomfortable. There's also no cable or internet. The weather is also in the low 60s. Im incredibly upset and want to go home because we could have just cared for his gma in the much larger home not on the coast where we can get a little peace in the evenings (she's old and keeps the tv loud. I also suffer from misophonia - I truly wish I didn't - and can't stand to hear anyone smack their food or lips and his gma does it all the time) 
I'm not the quietest about my displeasure and my desire to return home. My boyfriend seems upset that I can't just suck it up, but honestly I feel as though I was manipulated into doing something that I never would have agreed to had I known the conditions of the place we'd be staying. 
I'm not too happy with the town either. This entire ""vacation"" feels like a waste of time and money."		1	0
c29ruz	2019-06-18 23:53:28	LifeTelevision3	WIBTA for terminating services because they employ my ex?	" 

This is a throwaway account...

I recently found out that my financial advisor (FA) is a silent partner in a restaurant. FA is a great person who I like, and he does an excellent job. He only provides financial support for the business and does not have anything to do with personnel.

The restaurant recently promoted my ex to general manager. He made a mess of my life that has taken years to rebuild. 

It makes me angry to think that I, by employing the services of FA, am paying the salary of the POS who hurt me, my family, and my friends. I think the best course of action would be to terminate FA's services and move elsewhere. However, I don't want to be vindictive. I also do not want to cause drama that might bring this horrible person back into my life. I do not want to punish someone who does not deserve it (FA), but it is also not my fault that he allowed his partner to hire a drinking buddy that has been fired from his last two jobs for theft (references were not checked). I would not do anything if I wasn't employing FA myself. It is difficult to think that I am helping my ex in any way. WIBTA for changing financial services?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I live in an average Midwest town, and work as a Realtor, so I am on lots of advertising throughout the city for my job. The town is small enough that most everyone knows someone that knows you. 6 Months ago an old friend whom I haven't been close with in probably 5 years asked me to be in his wedding party, I of course agreed. As the date is getting closer the wedding is getting more and more strange. Now, I'm certainly not a prude, and am very open minded but I was raised in a Christian family so that's the way my moral compass sways.  This wedding is far from traditional, it will have male and female strippers, zombies, and drag queens running around in the middle of the ceremony and reception. I just feel embarrassed to be a part of it, and embarassed for the people thst are attending and dont know what theyre going to be in for. Also,  with my job I'm worried that I will alienate some of my less open minded clients by attending if they were to ever see photographs. Am I an asshole for wanting to tell my friend I cannot be in the wedding because I'm embarrassed to be seen there? Or am over-reacting?		1	0
c29rgz	2019-06-18 23:52:22		AITA for staying one night a week with my mom, and the rest with my dad	"Context:  3 years ago my family got in a pretty high conflict divorce that resulted in a lot of debt with my father fighting for custody of me (I wanted to be with him, and my mother wanted unilateral control of me).  In the past, she was horrible, stopping me from talking to him, and calling the police on me for running away to him.  I ended up being persistent enough to live full time with my dad.

In my view, she has changed, and because of this I have just started to spend one night a week with her, to start thawing the ice.  While in the past, she sometimes dissed my father, she only talks positively of him now and seems to respect my independence (I'm 16).  My father, while he will not (and cannot) stop me from doing this, has told me that I am being disloyal for doing so.  He says this because she broke up the family, and because, during the heat of the divorce, she tried to use the fact that he used to copy DVDs from the library against him, which could have put him in legal trouble.

From my side, I believe that since she is my mother, she deserves my time and my love.  When I was hardly spending any time with her, she continued to pay for things like my phone bill, among other things.  In my eyes, she has made a great change from who she was and deserves a second chance.  I find my father's behavior manipulative and horrible, as he is effectively making me choose between two parents.

c29rcn	2019-06-18 23:52:04	fuckfallout76	AITA for refusing to drop my male friends for my boyfriend?	"My boyfriend (21) and I (f18) often get into very heated arguments concerning my friends. I think it’s petty and unnecessary, but it’s a huge deal for him and he takes it seriously.

Since elementary school, my friend groups have mostly consisted of guys. I also have had (and still do have) plenty of girl friends and I love it! I love the company of women and wish I had more girl friends.

Nowadays, I mostly only talk to online friends. I have 2 online guy friends (the rest girls) I occasionally talk to, and one in-person guy friend (since middle school) who I sometimes make plans to hang out with, but I’m usually too anxious and just stay home instead. They do NOT flirt with me or try to make any moves.

My boyfriend is incredibly jealous, insecure and controlling. I’m not allowed to posts photos of myself online, guys can’t comment on anything I post even if it’s not myself (example: I posted a picture of a toad I caught, guy friend commented “this is my fav toad account”, boyfriend accused guy friend of flirting with me). I ended up just deleting my social media so I wouldn’t have to deal with it.

We pretty much only argue about how I “love the attention of other men” and I’m “just like every other woman”.  He says he’s the ONLY man that should be in my life and I have no business talking to any others, otherwise it means I’m riding their dick. He says I have no respect for him and has even threatened to leave me. He always thinks I’m doing something behind his back and makes me show him my messages to see if I’m talking to any men. I’m moving in with him next year to his state since he was discharged from the army and sent back home recently, and he even told me I can’t hang out with him and his best friends because he doesn’t want me getting close to them because I might fall for them.

About 2 days ago we got into it and I flat out told him I’m not dropping my current friends for him, but I will compromise and won’t make any future male friends. He wasn’t really satisfied but he agreed.

I know so far it sounds like I’m obviously not the asshole, but here’s where it gets more complicated to me. He has a personality disorder that he seriously struggles with and he has been cheated on in the past, so he’s cautious. I know he’s just scared so he takes extreme measures to make sure I’m only his and to make sure his relationship is “protected” and he doesn’t get hurt. He knows he acts irrationally, because when he’s calm he feels like shit about it and wishes he didn’t act this way.

I don’t have a history of cheating or being disloyal.

We have plans for the future and I really love him so I feel like maybe I’ve been an ass for not taking his feelings into account.

TLDR; my boyfriend has a personality disorder and a past of being cheated on and won’t let me have guy friends.

"Long story short, My work closed the doors last year, and I took a similar job with better pay, only it was 3 hours from where we lived. I have been making the weekly commute for the last 7 months. Finally got an offer to sell our house, and found a new house close to new job. Anyway, I have been bringing non essentials back with me every week and storing at a storage unit. Now we arrive to full moving weekend so I rented a trailer to get the final load. It’s obvious that we still have too much to load into the trailer, so I started looking through totes and boxes to see if I can consolidate some items, and that’s when I discovered why we had so much extra stuff: my wife had packed pillows in individual totes, blankets in individual totes, toilet paper in individual totes, large coats in boxes, and several boxes of clothes hangers. I’m talking like 15- 20 boxes and totes. I had been loading/packing all day and was a little upset. I sort of yelled and told my wife that she could have used plastic bags for most of the items instead of individual boxes/totes. Anyway, I started taking items out and putting them into bags, then was able to fully load the trailer. Yes, everything fit. My wife however, has barely spoken to me since. She is upset that I was upset at her for packing the way she did. Aita? She doesn’t work, and was supposed to finish packing the rest of our things. I should also mention that she knew that we didn’t have much trailer space.

Edit: Discussed with wife on the drive down and admitted to being TA. She agreed that she didn’t think about it much and she was just throwing whatever in boxes. We both agreed to plan ahead better next time we pack. Thanks for everyone’s comments!"	Asshole	0	0

He hasn't gotten fitted for his tux yet, even though I told him his deadline was June 1st, which is when Men's Wearhouse told me was the latest he could go without running out of time; he just ignores my texts whenever I try to talk to him about it. I don't even know if he's going to have time at this point or if he's SOL on the tux.

We also agreed to rent out a house for the weekend since most of the wedding party is out of town. The importance of the house was to have a place for all of us to be for the rehearsal, our welcome party, and getting ready on the day of the wedding, as well as a place to stay the night of the wedding. I told him about it at our engagement party months ago and he agreed to it and said he was totally okay with the cost. I started reminding them about two weeks ago that the house payment is coming up and now he refuses to pay. He's arguing with me, telling me he should pay less because he has to take off Friday for the rehearsal, even though everyone is having to take off Friday. His biggest argument is that he should pay less because he's staying less days than some of the other people; those other people ARE paying more, just not as much as he wants them to be paying. To top it all off, he brought up a vacation TWO YEARS AGO that I unknowingly underpaid him for by $50; as soon as he mentioned it I venmoed that to him and apologized, but he still refuses to pay for this.

I picked him to be a groomsman because I love him and because he's important to me. He's been difficult with the only two things I've asked him to do for this wedding and frankly I'm stressed out and fed up. We're so close to the wedding and I don't need this added stress on top of everything else we're dealing with.

Today, I got really fed up and, after dealing with this for days, I told him that he owes me the money for the house and he needs to be fitted for his tux ASAP or he can drop out of being a groomsman. I'm considering uninviting him from the wedding entirely at this point because of all this stress and because he's going to cost me and my fiance hundreds of dollars for dropping out of a house that he committed to months ago.

AITA for the ultimatum?

&#x200B;

EDIT: In regards to finances, it doesn't look like he's hurting. He was ready to pay for my bachelor party cruise that was about $550 that ended up falling through; he also just went on a spontaneous vacation to central America for his birthday. So it looks like he has the cash and that the problem is really about the wedding itself rather than the money."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Me and my ex we're seeing each other for a couple months before we decided to get serious. Little did I know that at the time she had dated the sister of one of my best friends and still had a lot of feelings for her. After I found this out I confronted her about this and told her that if she wanted to break up because she was unsure I would be ok with it(I've been cheated on in the past and didn't want it to happen again). She insisted that she wanted to be with me and didn't want it any other way. I found out after one month of serious dating she had slept with her ex twice and I was appalled. I couldn't believe that even after the chance I gave her that she would still do this to me. I know it doesn't seem like a long time and that I'm being a little dramatic but I feel head over heels for her and made that very clear. Anyways it turned out that she didn't just cheat on me she had told her ex(my friends sister) every secret I had ever trusted her with. So I called it off with her and made it clear that I very much so despised her and her ex.

After a couple months had pasted I got a text from my friends sister asking if we could talk. I said yes because her brother is one of my longest and best friends. When she got to my house she had an out burst about how she's mab at me that apparently I got out of the relationship less ""hurt"" than her and how that isn't fair. When I tell her that she has no idea what she's talking about she starts accusing me of all sorts of things from being racist (she's native and I'm white) to abusing her and my ex. I told her that I would never lay a hand on anyone and that if she's going to accuse me of this I'm going to kick her out of my house. She agrees to leave after I threatened to call the cops and tells me that she forgives me.

So fast forward to last week my ex starts trying to contact me. I immediately think that she's trying to do something again like get me back and play me and her ex again. When she tells me that she's done with her and has cut all ties with her. She then goes on the tell me that she still has feelings for me and wants another chance. Keep in mind that it's been about 8 months since I broke up with her. I've been talking to her and it's clear that she still has feelings for me and I know that I don't have any towards her. We've kissed a couple times and I've kinda been getting her hopes up. I feel bad about it but at the same time she spread a lot of my deepest secrets and her ex came at me with a lot of stuff that wasn't true but for a guy if it got out would ruin my life.

So I leave it to you reddit. AITA?

c29oec	2019-06-18 23:43:58	Beastmode0324	AITA for wanting to cut my own mother out for money?	"Around the time I started going to college, my mother started asking me for money, usually around $500 or so and I was able to give it to her cause my grandma set aside $15,000 when she passed away and my mom usually was good with paying me back. Flashforward to my 2nd year in college, and my mom has borrowed about $3,000 total, I had a panic attack for the first time in my life because I have really bad anxiety especially when it came to money and I didn't have enough money to pay for my spring quarter (I get about $4,000 added into my account every year since my aunt is controlling it so it last through the 4 years). I finally told the level of stress she's been putting me through and ask her not to ask me for any more money, she said she wasn't aware and how she's sorry about it and agreed to pay me back in full. One thing I asked for specifically was I wanted her to go donate plasma and give me $56 (I played in a pick'em league, for those who don't know it's like fantasy football but you just pick what team is going to win.) I asked for $56 because I ended up winning and when I asked for my money since I had her hang on to it, she told me she spent it already but that she'll pay me back by the end of the trip (she didn't). She agreed to pay me back that $56 and I thought that was it. 

About 3 months later, I get a text from her saying and I quote ""Since I can no longer ask you for money, I need you to go pay for the last 3 months of your portion of the phone bill in the next couple days or our phones get turned off."" I. WAS. PISSED. She had me pay for the bill earlier but it was never an agreed thing I'd do when I first got the phone, it was me just being nice and helping her out. I had another panic attack then since I had to pay $900 for the quarter (financial aid helps me soooo much and I'm thankful for it) along with textbooks which were another $500 along with now having to pay $250 in the next couple of days.

Today she politely asked me if while I am on my period I could try to bury my used tampons. I wrap them in toilet paper but the blood bleeds through and she can see it. At first, I said no problem. The more that I think of it I don't really want to be digging my hand in the trash to bury my tampons. They belong in the trash, I wrap them, I think she can just avoid looking at it if it grosses her out.

I dont wanna go into details on how much i love him because we do text and have hungout a few times as friends and he is just such a shy thoughtful person :( He has a girlfriend of 1.5 years. I would never make a move or anything and im ok with being just friends but he did mention once his gf was iffy on us hanging out :/ Anyways- I told my manager i had a crush on him (but that he does have a gf) i just said hes so and hyped him work ethic wise up )  Ok so hes coming in Friday for an interview!!!!!

c29l6w	2019-06-18 23:35:26	aerialariel22	WIBTA if I told my friend that our other two friends think she’s annoying?	"I have three friends, Meg, Erica, and Carly (fake names). I’ve known Erica since childhood and met Carly and Meg through Erica, in that order. Erica and Carly are tight. They live together. Meg lives maybe 40 minutes away from Erica and Carly. I live over an hour from all three. This is relevant later. 

Erica and Carly decided last summer that Meg’s personality is unbearable to be around (too loud, obnoxious, smothering) plus, according to them, Meg just goes with whichever of her friends is most appealing per evening/weekend. They were convinced that if they ghosted Meg, Meg would forget about them. They were wrong and now here we are. 

Everything Erica and Carly think about Meg is opposite of what I think about her. Meg is fun, caring, adventurous, etc. So I told Erica and Carly that I still wanted to be friends with her, which is fine with them “as long as I don’t gossip about them to Meg.” 

I went along with these terms for almost a year now. I am finding it harder and harder to stick to them because Meg has been more of a friend to me than Erica and Carly. Meg has wanted to hang out with me despite the hour or more drive. When my dog died last month, she was there for me to talk it out. I’ve leant her money (less than $600) in the past and she’s paid it back. 

Erica and Carly only come see me if they’re in town for another reason. I got an “I’m so sorry” from Erica and silence from Carly when my dog died. I’ve leant both of them money (less than $600 separately) and neither has fully paid me back. I could go on. 

In a couple weeks there will be a large family party at my parent’s house. All three ladies are invited. Erica and Carly were debating on going (they claim they need the weekend for moving), but immediately bailed when they learned Meg was coming. 

Would I be the asshole if I told Meg that the real reason Erica and Carly aren’t coming is because of her, and that they don’t like her in general?"	Asshole	0	0

c29kmd	2019-06-18 23:33:52		WIBTA if I found new homes for my sisters cats?	"Throwaway because family on Reddit.

My sister is moving her family (5yo twins, husband and two small dogs) into a trailer at a campground for a short time  (6 weeks). She wants to stay near our parents who are both dying at various rates. She wants to spend time with our parents for a long as possible before she moves to a different state.

She asked if I could keep her 2 cats and  I said yes, but if anything happens to them Im going to feel awful. First three nights they kept us up all night (we work, my sister and her husband do not).  I also have 2 cats and a dog who keeps getting his ass beat by my sisters cats (SC) We moved SC to the garage where they busted open a window and got out (window needs replacing) I've been out looking for them in the rain for hours, found one. So now we are going on 4 days of BS and a lost cat. 

I've tried to communicate to my sister how big of a pain this has become. How is effecting my husband who works physical labor and needs to sleep, how I'm going to feel so bad if I can't find the cat. Her response has been ""sorry"" and  ""it will come back"". 

I honestly feel like she doesn't want the cats but is so passive aggressive that she will just let me lose them. 

Some background: My sister has the coping skills of a toddler. We are not close, we argue a lot over politics and we are barely holding our shit together with all of the work required to take care or patents (we split it, but I do all the scheduling, meds and extras).  

I have mentioned to her that we could get another person to keep them short-term from Craigslist. She's said  ""no, I would be too worried"".!?

Now I'm stuck with these cats, she won't take them back. I can't  keep wasting time and energy on it and I regret ever saying yes.

One of my coworkers, old man Joe, is this old guy who always seems to get turned around. He will forget things almost constantly, immediately after you tell him and generally does things that end up making my job harder. Most days I just follow him around and fix his mistakes. Only time I get a chance to do things that actually matter is when his mistakes don't really do anything so he's essentially just twiddling his thumbs thinking hes helping (like giving your little cousin an unplugged playstation controller). 

Anyway, he's showing some early signs of what i think is Parkinson's disease. Forgetfulness, random anger outbursts, a shuffled walk. But it's really just Dr.Google diagnosis. But i felt like I should tell our boss. So I told the boss that i think old man Joe should see a doctor because of the above reasons and even stating it's just a guess. And it turned out the boss didnt even know about anger outbursts and seemed pretty shocked and very serious about it. Old man joe had yelled at everyone who works there for no reason. Literally I've had to sit and wait for him to finish cursing at me so i could complete some tasks he didnt know we were supposed to do. Like he was cursing at me because he thought i was just making up BS work and wouldnt believe boss told me specifically to do it.

So now old man Joe is about one mistake away from losing his job and i feel pretty terrible that it could be my fault for telling the boss about the anger issues. It would make my life easier though. But I've never gotten someone fired before."	Asshole	0	0

AITA for not inviting our parents when we eloped?

My husband and I only dated for 2 months before getting engaged and then spent another 2 months together before getting married. I was 19 and he was 21 at the time. He was deploying to Afghanistan and it really felt like a ""now or never"" situation for us. He asked for my fathers blessing, which he readily gave with the stipulation that only if we did pre-marital counseling would he give us his blessing. We were living in separate states and so we did it online via skype together, my dad said it didn't count, then I asked my dad if he would officiate. He said he would but that it meant he'd be our marriage counselor for life and I told him I was wildly uncomfortable with that so if that was the case then I didn't want him to do it. He got pissed at me and didn't talk to me for months saying he was disappointed in how childish I was being.

We told our families we would be eloping and in 5 years we would throw a party when we could afford it and when we felt like we had really earned that kind of wedding celebration. Any celebration at the time would have just been angry apprehensive family who were worried. We didn't want to have that on the day we got married. We were excited and wanted to enjoy ourselves without the weight of our families worries and disappointments on us.

My mother was understandably worried and also incredibly negative through the entire engagement. I know it was short and quick. No matter what she just could not talk about it with me and kept punishing me by not talking to me. She cancelled my cell phone and kicked me off our joint car insurance because ""if I could get married then I could manage my own affairs."" Which is totally fair, but all of that negativity just made me not want her there when we got married.

When we did get married a friend of mine was our witness and we just went to the courthouse, the three of us, and then got sandwiches and went to the beach.

This is an old situation and all involved parties have since moved on, we've been married for 7 years and eventually did throw that big party, everyone had a great time, but I'm curious as to what the masses think."	Not the A-hole	0	0

In April I used the parking app we have in Philadelphia to pay for my friends parking when we went to grab lunch together after watching our two soccer teams play each other. I knew I had a train to catch to go to NYC for the weekend. So I was on a time constraint. I paid for an hour and 20 minutes of parking. Enough time for us to eat and get back to the car while avoiding a parking ticket from PPA (Philadelphia parking authority aka the devil). I finished my meal before him as usual. Told him my train was coming in 30 minutes as I had to uber to the train station. He wanted to stay longer and finish his meal. Before I left I texted him the exact time remaining on the parking meter. I even continued to send reminders to him while I was gone saying that there's 8 minutes left, or 4 minutes left. He returns to his car after it expires and gets a ticket. He proceeds to flip out, attack and berate saying it's my fault he got the $36 ticket and if I was a ""real friend"" I would have paid a full 2-3 hours for parking (although we didn't need that).  I told him I paid for the parking and had to leave. I sent him many reminders of how much time was left and said if he was staying its up to him to pay additional time. I personally don't think its my responsibility to pay for this ticket. He has constantly disrespected me since and its to the point now where I freaked the fuck out and we are no longer friends.

I'm friends with this guy called Jack (all names fake), and he has a girlfriend called Rina. Now I was at this fast food joint with some other friend and got approached by these two other strangers. They told us to come to some open door party that was happening in a few days and so I said we'd go.

I was like 16-17 (also male, and still male), and so open door house parties were a first of mine. The friend who was with me at the fast food joint ended up not wanting to go, so I brought Jack.

So me and Jack went to this random open door house party. Note ME and JACK both have girlfriends. I am a committed and loyal person but Jack has been known to flirt. We get there and later on in the party, Jack tells me ""That girl over there in the kitchen is really hot, would you tell Rina if I made out with her?"". I said, ""dude you shouldn't do it but I won't tell her"".

Well, he ends up making out with her and I carry this secret telling no one else. A few months later he tells me how he's told some his friends with a grin on his face, I think it's because he gets joy from putting himself in risky situations. Because he's started telling other people I just think there's a fair chance Rina knows now.

Now around this time I'm looking for part time jobs and being friends with Rina because she is my girlfriend's friend, she gets me a job at her work, so I end up seeing Rina every fortnight.

A year or so goes by, and now I am 18. I still continue seeing Rina every fortnight and we've gotten closer, and I thought about telling her about the incident with Jack, but she really likes him she's very happy, and Jack seemed to be treating her better.

I end up going to the club for the first time with another friend and end up bumping into Jack. After some talking he says ""let's go upstairs, I wanna try get with some chicks there"". Hearing this I just immediately think he's the same Jack. We end up separating naturally in the club anyway, too crowded to keep together.

The following weeks I go to work and feel like I should tell Rina. Me and Rina are pretty close now. Rina doesn't hang out with her friends as much since college as her STEM degree she's pursuing in University takes all her time. This results in her just hanging out with Jack. I end up telling her about those two instances as I believe it should be her right to know.

She gets upset, as you would. She went to his after work and she said she cried and talked about it. Jack's sorry and Rina is more cautious now. They still happily together though, so it worked out in the end for them. AITA? I definitely fucked over Jack."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Pre relationship I knew her and her ex fiance tried for kids for 3 years. Didnt happen. He came out as a gay priest lol. She told her close friends including me she had cancer and had over a few years had 3 sets of chemotherapy. Saying that it was impossible to have a child. So as you can imagine everything seemed straight forward, I helped her a few times with payments for her debt for treatment etc.

When B was born we considered it a miracle. Well... turns out the cancer was a lie and she tricked me into getting her pregnant.

Despite the fact I'm not happy and everytime I see B part of me sees what D did. I decided that due to me living abroad with them, I'd still get married and stay with D or my daughter wouldn't learn English or be able to communicate with me for a long time.

"Alright here's the situation: I'm a college student and recently got an apartment that I'm sharing with 4 other people. Right now, only two of my roommates are living there and the rest of us will be moving in in August when classes start. I brought and set up a nice TV about a month ago so they could have it to use over the summer. I just got a text from one of my roommates who is currently in the apartment saying the batteries exploded in the TV remote and it no longer works. She informed me that a replacement one she found online would cost $30 and asked if I wanted to pay the full price (her reasoning is that it would be fully mine when we move out) or if I'd like to split the cost between all 5 of us. I know it isn't her fault that the batteries exploded but I don't want to pay for a replacement remote when I wasn't even living in the apartment when it broke and I also wouldn't feel right putting the responsibility on my other roommates would aren't there. Personally I think my two roommates who are there should replace it since they are the ones living there when it broke but I don't want my roommates to hate me. Would it be unreasonable for me to ask them to replace it?


Update: I've nicely explained how I feel and given my roommate the choice of cleaning out the remote if she feels comfortable doing so or splitting the cost of a MUCH cheaper universal remote two ways with my other roommate who is currently living in the apartment. The remote is $10 so they would only need to pay $5 each instead of the $6 each they already agreed to pay."	No A-holes here	0	0

"So I'm a junior (HS) and recently began to have deep feelings for someone in my circle this past year. I became completely infatuated with them, and tried to draw closer to them, which was working. I told one person about all of this, a senior, who was and still is one of my best friends. 

Well around a half month ago, I received a text from my friend saying that my crush had revealed her feelings for him, and that he liked her as well. It was a punch in the gut. It really did hurt. He wasn't asking for my permission, nor should he, but of course I replied that ""they would be a cute couple"" and that ""I'm happy they were happy together"", but I said it because he was my friend and I wasn't willing to end that over this. 

In reality it hurts like hell now every time we get together, and I see them cuddling up or whispering to each other, holding hands and laughing. Frankly I'm obsessing over the whole situation, and I don't know how to stop. I was hoping that I could somehow move on or something, but there is absolutely no one in my life who I could see myself having feelings for. 

I absolutely adore both of them, they're absolutely wonderful people, and I don't want either of them to be unhappy, but is it wrong for me to hope that they would have some kind of disagreement or fight or complication that would end in them breaking up? I'm not actively trying to split them up, but I honestly hate seeing them together. Which is conflicting because I love seeing them happy.

So am I the asshole? Am I some kind of Disney Villain? Should I move on? I'm conflicted on a level that I've never felt before and I just hate myself for it.

c29ex8	2019-06-18 23:18:47	Philtastic_	AITA for being uncomfortable at the way my mutual friends had sex?	"Hi all, thanks in advance for the help on this one! I’m not a fan of long text posts so I’ll try to keep it as short as possible:

This past weekend I went to a music festival with 3 friends, 2 of them are my best friends (1 male, 1 female) who I introduced to each other sometime last year. Going into the festival I was excited because I felt like we had a good new group dynamic going on. It was me and my 2 best friends going to a new festival, what could go wrong? 

Anyways, on the second day of the festival, I return to our festival campsite and my 2 best friends BOTH approach me face-to-face and the following interaction went exactly as follows:

*both of them run up to me
Guy: can we smash?
Girl: can we smash?
Guy: can we smash? 
Me: (shocked and sheepishly)...uhh you guys are grown adults you can do whatever you want.

They then proceeded to have sex in the tent that I was supposed to sleep in. 

There is much more to the story but in the interest of keeping it to the core events, I think that this is enough. 

I haven’t talked much to them since then. I’m still not sure if I should feel right about feeling strange about all of this. 

Look — I know that I said “yes.” I know that I gave them my go ahead, but does it not seem a little inconsiderate for both of them to pose the question in the fashion that they did? It feels like I was forced into the position to say yes. 

Moreover, I have no issues with hook ups or sex. I’ve had my fair share of one night stands and I’ve even let me guy friend in this story hook up with a random girl in my own bed so I really feel like it’s not a matter of me disagreeing with them choosing to have sex with each other — it feels like I was slapped in the face a bit (so to speak). 

For some reason it makes me a little uncomfortable that 2 friends who I introduced to each other had sex. But even more so, I feel a bit disrespected at the way they approached the situation.

(First Reddit post)	"I've been working at a job for a few months now. everything was going great untill my hours where cut, okay no big deal they are training a few new people. I role like that making just enough to get by. then one Tuesday I get in and I'm scheduled for one day for 2 weeks, I ask for more hours. Apparently I have been asking to leave and they had been under the impression that I didn't want to be there. Actually, I have been working until it slowed to the point where I had no work left, I then ask the manager if he wants me there. He would look at the time and how many guess are there and release me after I did a small amount. They basicly told me it was a Asshole move because they pick up after I leave, which I know for a fact is bull because I usually leave an hour and a half before closing and it is dead. So I gotta ask am I the asshole? I've been let go recently.

Edit: I guess instead of asking ""do you want me here still?"" I should be asking ""is there anything else you want me to do?"" Thanks Reddit."	No A-holes here	0	0

So first a little backstory: Me and a friend named Josh were driving to a far away Walmart, to deliver a bottle of vape juice to another friend named Jay and his brother Sean.

      Now for the issue at hand. As we parked in the lot to give Jay the vape juice, Sean who was driving his Ford Crown Victoria sedan pulled up very close to my car and had jay pick up the vape juice from my window. After jay retrieved the juice sean pulled his car up an inch while jay told him when to stop. Sean was now a fingers width of my drivers side door leaving me unable to exit my car. He rolls down his window in the rain and yells ""Josh can i come over"" while me and Josh are scared shitless that sean is doing this. We decided we dont want to hang out with him because he was acting crazy so Josh told him ""No"" firmly.Sean then proclaims ""I'm not moving until you guys say i can come over"" we argued back and forth until we said yes just so we could get away from Sean.

     After the incident in the Walmart parking lot, Sean began following us back to Josh's house until we managed to get away from him. We drove about 20 minutes back to Josh's road we saw Sean sitting in a church parking lot as we drove by Sean flipped us off and started following us back to Josh's calling us non stop. Finally we answered his call and again firmly stated that he cant come over and to go home.

     Now as im typing this Josh's girlfriend is calling us TA for not hanging out with them after he pressured us to say he could. So i'd like to know, Reddit AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c29a2i	2019-06-18 23:06:21	moistntasty	AITA for not wanting my parents to borrow my car?	"For starters at the begining on the year i moved back in with my parents. Rent was getting outrageous and they live in town so it wasnt a big deal. They said they are happy to have me and are glad to help me save on finances.

Two months ago my dads car had engine trouble so while it was in the shop he was borrowing my grandmothers car. Duing that time he wrecked and totalled it. It was his fualt accident and insurance is not replacing it. He doesnt believe in carring collision insurance. He has yet to replace my grandmothers car.

One month later my transmission dies in my old beater that was on its last leg and we all decuded the best option was to replace it. My brother in law sold me his  newer car (same make and model as my grandmothers old car) since he was getting a truck at the end of the week. My mother fronted the cash and i have one more payment to pay her back. I love this car and im proud to call it mine but i cant do that in front of my grandmother.

Cut to today when my mother crashed her car (no collision insurance) and it looks like it might be drivable but its missing the front bumper and the headlights are smashed up. Once again my family is the at fault member.

My biggest worry is at the start of next month my parents are doing a 1400 mile road trip to florida and they want to take my car. Im terrified that it will be totaled on this trip. AITA for wanting to say no to them?

c299x2	2019-06-18 23:05:55		AITA (M 43) for asking my wife (F39) to spend more time with her family	"Hi assholes.

So I spend half my time thinking I am well righteous, the other half thinking IATA.

We have two boys aged 4 and 6. I get them out of bed in the morning, ready them for school, dress, teeth, do homework, make beds, make our bed, sort breakfast and take them to school. She makes their lunches.

Wife is up at 5am every morning to go running. Returns at 7am, spends an hour showering and getting ready for work. We both work from home, I am the main breadwinner.

Wife fetches kids from school at 5pm and usually makes dinner. Goes to yoga on Wed eve and gym Friday eve, so I cook then. If she is 'out' with her gal pals, usually once but sometimes twice a week, I make dinner. After dinner, I do bathtime and homework, and then I spend an hour or so with my boys playing Xbox or doing puzzles. At 7:45 I chase the lads to wee and get into bed, then I read a storybook and tell them some tales of when I was young. While all this is happening, the Mrs does dishes (I help stack the dishwasher and I always empty it the next morning) or is on her phone.

Wife does not involve me or the boys in her sports, actively avoids it. She doesn't like coming with on our Saturday and Sunday walks with the dog + boys, which is hard because 4yo is learning to ride his bike with me pushing, and me also hanging on to an unruly beagle.

So here's my gripe - I hassle her regularly telling her she needs to be more involved in parenting and she needs to involve  our boys in her sports (she often hints that I should take them to soccer or hockey...but I am a cyclist and a runner and a hiker, and I take my boys cycling, running and hiking). We occasionally have fights over this and she gets very defensive and never admits any fault, but after a fight things will improve for a while as she makes more effort (like taking the laundry off my hands, which does make my life easier).

I have also said to her being up at 5am every morning and out most evenings isn't on; she says her fitness makes her happy and that it isn't her problem if I choose not to go out (I rarely do 'man time' with my mates). I also tell her that she is obsessed with her appearance (she is a very attractive woman) and should tone it down, spending an hour every morning on makeup etc is OTT.

I say she should consider that 'her happiness' isn't the top priority here - I have gladly sacrificed my own in the interests of raising children better, and I have gotten used to doing new things for fun. That aggravates her a lot.

So, am I the asshole? Bear in mind, the way she will tell this story will probably be radically different, so try put yourself in her shoes. And she is a lovely person, too, we've been married for nearly a decade and together for 15 years."	No A-holes here	0	0
c299n9	2019-06-18 23:05:11		AITA for telling my sister she hurt my feelings therefore “making her feel guilty about it?”	"I want to keep this as simple as possible. 
I kind of have an inkling that my sister doesn’t think I’m very smart in general. 
She was helping me study for a test with quizlet(flashcards) I wasn’t getting very many right ( I think it had to do with the fact that I made them in a rush not trying to make up excuses.) anyway cut to later she sends me a funny Seinfeld clip where Elaine is trying to study Bob Odenkirk so he can become a doctor and he was also not doing very well. It was a funny clip but then I started thinking about how maybe she’s trying to elude to how me and him are both stupid in a way. So, when we were on the phone I said hey can I just tell you something. That clip was funny but it kind of hurt my feelings. And then she started getting angry and yelling about how annoying it was that It hurt my feelings and why am I trying to put a weight in her or make her feel guilty. Why do I think she’s such a terrible person that would try to hurt anyone’s feelings. I told her I don’t know maybe because I didn’t get bullied in school and you did so you’re kind of trying to humble me a little or something (not sure if this is true but just trying to rationalize why she might subconsciously do this to me.) 

TLDR: am I the asshole for making my sister  feel guilty and terrible by expressing she accidentally/subconsciously hurt my feelings?"		1	0

c298tr	2019-06-18 23:03:04		AITA for reporting my ex-boyfriend for cheating on his exams after learning he cheated on me	"(Using a throwaway account because I don’t want him or his friends to see this)

This whole fiasco just happened a few weeks ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for about 4 years. Things were going great until about the last year where we started doing long distance because I transferred schools. 

He was looking to transfer out of his local city college, but struggled with school quite a bit. Problems began to arise when he would start asking me to help him cheat on exams to do better in classes. At this city college, many classes had online tests that were very easy to cheat on, given that you were fast at Googling things. I became the person that would Google all the answers and send them to him as he took the test. I hated it, but I did it because I knew he wanted to go to a school that was very competitive to get into and follow his dreams. This was, of course, my mistake for obliging him.

Things escalated when he would ask me to take his tests inside the classroom. He would go into the classroom, sneak pictures of all the test pages, and then send them to me, so I could solve the questions somehow and send them back to him. I was never happy about it, but I did it every test, midterm, and final exam. It became a huge issue in our relationship, but I always caved when he got desperate and sad the night before exams. I’m still not even sure how he was able to pull these stunts off without getting caught. 

This went on for about a year, with some elaborate cheating schemes that I was sadly involved in. I kept this up while also balancing my own schoolwork (I’m a graduate student with very little free time outside of schoolwork/research). 

In the end, he got straight As and got into every college he applied to. I was ecstatic, but our problems were only getting worse. I tried visiting often to help salvage the relationship, but it was no use. Towards the end of the year, we started fighting more and things broke off.

I later learned that he had been cheating on me about a month before we broke up. I don’t know how many times, but I suspect multiple times. I was outraged and completely lost my temper. The day after finding out, I flew down to his city, walked into the Dean’s office, and reported all of his cheating along with all of the evidence I had to corroborate my claims.

The college re-evaluated all his grades to Ds and Fs, which will almost certainly affect his ability to transfer to any of his dream schools. He found out it was me obviously and yelled at me, which made me regret the whole situation very much. I don’t think he’s going to be able to go to any college now with this stain on his record.

I feel guilty and horrible but I can’t take back what I did. It was a moment of pure anger and sadness, I just wanted revenge.

TLDR: I helped my boyfriend cheat on his exams for a year, then reported him because I found out he cheated on me before we broke up."		1	0

People are in pain, feverish and exhausted and trying to be as comfortable as possible but this thing is loud! I'm there with my wife who's broken her hand. I ask nicely and get ignored.

c2977d	2019-06-18 22:58:52	1234ideclareworldwar	AITA for removing slow swimmers from the fast lane I am swimming in at the public pool?	"I swim quite frequently, mostly with my team but when I can’t make a practice or have some extra time for whatever reason I sometimes use the public lane pool. Unfortunately, I sometimes have to deal with a slow swimmer who is quite literally out of their depth, especially in the fast lane. This annoys me to no end especially when said swimmer won’t stop at the walls to let me pass them and just continues to be a useless inconvenience. I quite frankly do not care if every other lane is occupied with 8 people, if you’re swimming slow you shouldn’t be in the fast lane. 

Anyway I will actively try and remove them, either by being threatening, like swimming fast constantly and coming very close to pass them, swimming butterfly in middle (a very successful tactic), or just by asking, usually politely, there was one instance when some twat had the nerve to tell me I shouldn’t be swimming in the middle so I just told him that if he didn’t like it he’s free to move to a lane more in line with his (very lacking) abilities. Quite frankly I don’t see anything wrong with this, none of the lifeguards seem to mind and even help if they notice a swimmer is being especially slow (I’m also good friends with most of them) and I don’t see why I should be subjected to inconvenience just because there is a space shortage. I’m also willing to accommodate swimmers who I’m friends with and who are polite  to me and make sure to not get in my way (which is very few unfortunately).

c296cs	2019-06-18 22:56:40	DirtyToothbrushes	AITA for not paying for my friend's bday bill?	"My friends and I decided to surprise one of our friends on his birthday by showing up to his house with a customized cake. We thought it would be funny if we photoshopped a picture of him as part of an inside joke and have it placed on the cake. I even took the time to photoshop it myself. I want to make this clear. I do not have a job so i have no source of income. I'm a medical student, so I mostly rely on my parents for income. Unfortunately, medical school is pretty demanding and doesn't allow me anytime for a part time job.

I asked my parents for money to be able to split the birthday cake. We put a lot of thought into it. Fast forward to his birthday. We show up, surprise him and give him the cake. He loved it. Minutes later, two of his friends from another group show up out of nowhere to ""surprise"" him when they had originally told us that they weren't going to make it because of work and kids. Their original plan was to throw a surprise party on the upcoming weekend to make up for their absence. Our plan was to cut the cake, play games and hangout at his house and on the last second they changed their mind and suddenly became available.

They show up randomly and propose to go out for dinner. The only issue was that I was broke. So I decided to go home and apologized that I wouldn't be able to tag along since I only had around $15 cash. I made it clear that I'm broke and did not want to limit their restaurant options. However, they made it clear that we were going to a cheap spot. My friend (the birthday boy) kept pushing me as well so I felt bad leaving and agreed to join them. After all, It was his birthday, and I wanted to be there for it.

Once we were ready to leave, they wanted to split our friend's meal AND the drinks he ordered. One of my friends and I did not want to split because it was not agreed upon beforehand in addition to the fact that this ""dinner"" completely blindsided us and was not planned. I was not fully prepared for it. Also, again, I'm freaking broke. I even mentioned it as the reason why I did not want to join them in the first place. They all got angry at my friend and about how we refused to split our bday friend's bill. They wanted me to pay around 40$. My meal alone was about 13$. I had to limit what I ordered for myself in order to stay within my budget.

Their stance is that if you are surprising your friend on their birthday, it is assumed/a social queue that everyone pays for that friend however, if it's planned beforehand and the birthday friend is aware of the plans, then everyone pays for themselves. This to me, does not make any sense. They even went as far as calling me a liar and saying that there was no way I could be ""that broke"". 

This all comes after weeks of planning a surprise party for my friend and these people coming out of nowhere for that dinner. AITA?

P.S. They're also mad at my friend who refused to split; he has a job and they believe he has more of a reason to pay."	Not the A-hole	0	0

A few months ago I(21F) began dating a girl I met over social media. We had a lot in common and I was really happy in the relationship until she confessed to me she was transgender. I initially was shocked but she was very open with me and apologetic about misleading me and told me I could ask any questions I had. I have never dated a transgender individual before but I liked her and wanted to make it work. I asked her some very personal questions like had she had the surgery, what happened to her penis when she takes hormones, etc and she was completely fine and receptive to me until I asked her what was her birth name. She refused to give it to me and I got offended because she told me I could ask her anything and it felt like she was hiding something from me. Shortly after I ended things by just telling her I didn’t think things were working out.  I told my friend about it and she thinks i’m wrong for dumping her over this, but I felt misled as she told me how open and willing to answer any question until I asked one she didn’t like. AITA?

EDIT: After reading all the comments I realized I’m the asshole and I handled the situation completely wrong. I was being very self centered and worried more about my feelings instead of hers and I didn’t respect her wishes. I wish I could apologize but after how I ended things I doubt she’d want to hear it. This was my first relationship at all and this taught me maybe I need to work on myself before attempting to date again.

c295jj	2019-06-18 22:54:46	AnonFloridan	AITA for telling my homosexual son that I'm sad I won't have any biological grandkids? (More context in post)	"EDIT: Consensus seems to point towards me being an asshole. I didn't mean to be, but I'll be sure to apologize to my son and just hopes he realizes I didn't mean anything negative during the discussion. Thanks everyone for the honest opinions!

---

Before I continue, I want it to be known that my son doesn't think I'm an asshole. I've tried to be nothing but loving and respectful towards him since the day he was born, and that doesn't change no matter what. I think he knows that. My wife, however, thinks I was the asshole here, so I was just looking for other opinions on the matter. I don't want my son to think I was an asshole, but he's just hiding that emotion or something, if that makes sense.

So to the context:

A while back, my only son told us that he was gay. We've known for a while, but I know that ""coming out"" was a huge moment for him, and knowing that he trusted us to tell us his biggest ""secret"" meant the world to me. We (my wife and I) both told him that it didn't change anything. We both loved him and will support him no matter what.

But a few days back while he was visiting, we began to talk. I reassured him that I loved him no matter what, but I told him that I had to be honest about it all. I had no problems with him being homosexual, but I was sad that he wouldn't give me any biological children. A huge part of my family life has been about ""continuing our legacy"", in a sense. As in, biologically, if that makes sense. I'm not really sure how to explain it. Nor was I able to truly explain it to him.

So what came out was something like this: ""I'm sad that I won't have any true grandchildren.""

That caused my wife to gasp, which made me realize what I said, so I quickly told him hat if he adopted I'd love them all the same, but there will always be that part of me that's sad that the children won't be his in a biological sense.

He seemed to know what I meant, and he understood and was happy that I was honest with him, and all seemed okay. But my wife thinks I'm the asshole for even bringing it up. And that makes me worried that I might have offended my son in some way.

Also, the fact that I'm having trouble putting everything into words makes me realize that I don't even really understand the situation fully. So I felt the need to ask here: Was I an asshole to my son?"	Asshole	0	0
c294dl	2019-06-18 22:51:46	metalzforbreakfast	AITA for wanting to ditch my friend's trip after his GF invited additional people?	"For context my friends and I are from EU. friend's GF is from the US.

&#x200B;

My friend has been with this girl for about 9-10 months now, they have a long distance relationship. He decided that he was going to visit her in 2 months and he thought that it would be cool if he invited his bestfriends, and she also invited her best friends to have a nice trip to NY and get to know eachother.

We liked the idea and therefore booked our plane tickets to the US (which were pretty expensive) and started looking for accomodation with airbnb.

To make it easier to understand this was the initial number of people : **4 people from the EU + 4 people from the US.**(including my friend and his GF)

This morning, we woke up to a text from my friend saying that some of the people from the US were also bringing their SOs, without running this with us first.

This changes the number from **4 EU + 7 US**, which kinda shifts the dynamic of the trip from 'let's meet each other's friends' to 'lets have a trip with my GFs friends and their SOs'.

We tried to explain to our friend that this was not the initial goal of the trip and that it could end up pretty shitty for us since we'll be around 4-5 totally unknown couples. He thinks we're overthinking and that it's gonna be fine.

&#x200B;

**At this point I'm considering either getting a different airbnb with my friends and just go visit the city by ourselves or simply getting a refund for the tickets. AITA?**"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2949o	2019-06-18 22:51:30	SensitiveWeb8	AITA for not Helping?	"So last night I came home from work, and on my way home I got very sick and ended up throwing up all over myself and my car. When I got home I jumped in the shower and then cleaned the mess out of my car because that mess in the heat just wasn't an option. Once I was done I washed up, ate three garlic cheese bread sticks bc my stomach was empty, took medicine, and just collapsed into bed.

&#x200B;

I woke up when my mom came home, she asked me to help her load up her car for camp. I'm still feeling weak and my stomach is still crampy, and I feel like I could be sick again so no. She got upset and insisted that I help her, but I physically don't feel capable so I stand my ground. She gets upset but relents and asks me to get up early in the morning to help. I ask what time and she says around 5am so that I would still have time to go to work. I said no idk if would feel better and its early. I said if she had her stuff ready I would try and move some if I felt up to it in the morn. She said she expected my help anyways.

&#x200B;

I tried to make casual conversation. She had someone bring in a new bathroom counter and medicine cabinet and paint. I didn't know she planned to redo the bathroom and was asking her questions about it. I got annoyed at one point because she basically gave her friend a house key and told her to come in any time to start working in the bathroom- since my mom is going away it didn't effect her at all. I stay in the house all summer, and we have one bathroom.

&#x200B;

I made a sandwich, ate it, then threw up everything I had eaten before. I took more medicine, then set to cleaning the bathroom. My mom was going to bed, so after cleaning up most of the mess, I went to bed. I left some vomit in the toilet- it would need to be scrubbed off and I knew if I did that at that second I would be sick [again.So](https://again.So) I decided to clean it in the morning. Besides, I've woken up to the bathroom being unusable because my mom didn't feel like cleaning up after herself despite not being sick so- I thought it would be fine.

&#x200B;

I went to bed and my mom starts screaming at me to come and look at this mess and clean it up right now. I explained that I had cleaned a ton already and that what was left was too much for me right now, and that I would get it in the morning before my shower. I pointed out that she leaves a mess all the time and that I just deal with it, and she flips out. I just walked away and went to bed.

&#x200B;

Her side: I got sick in the car and then cleaned the car. I ate a full meal and refused to help her with loading up her car. I also demanded to know things about the planned renos, and made everything about me even though its her house. She said that I was selfish for not wanting to get up early to help her, and that I was a selfish slob for being ok to get up early to clean a little bit of a mess but not to help her. She said that since I looked fine I couldn't be too sick, and that if I was really sick I would look it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c293dq	2019-06-18 22:49:12	my_mom_hella_gay	AITA for refusing to let her borrow my car	"This happened about 2 years ago, and I have some pretty bad anxiety so I’m wondering if I handled this situation correctly. I'm still living with my mom and she bought me a car as a graduation present after high school. I was so excited to have a new (to me) car. We had one condition of the car being in my name, I was gonna have to make payments on it and so I got myself a job, and since I got into college the summer after graduating, I didn't have a lot of free time. I went to class from 8-5 M-F and worked double shifts at a restaurant in town on the weekends. After a while a new girl started, and I thought she was cute so I was trying to show her the ropes (bisexual female). And so we got close, but just friends, and I found out that she had to walk about 5 miles each way from her house to work, so I offered to give her rides, it was a little out of my way but when I offered it was raining, and during October, so it was pretty cold. I gave her rides to and from work when I could, but then she started asking if she could use my car while I was in class. I have a pretty hard time telling people no, so I let her borrow it, and every time I did she would bring it back late, so some Fridays I had to call in saying I'd be late, and I would have to explain to my mom why I would be late coming home from classes, when class is only a 15 minute drive away, even my boss told me to stop letting her borrow my car. My mom is pretty scary when she wants to be (used to be in the military), so she told me to not let this girl borrow my car anymore when I was 2 hours late for work. The insurance for my car was in my moms name not mine, so what she says about it goes. The next day this girl asked if she could borrow my car 30 minute from closing, so I told her no, but I could still give her a ride if she waited about 45 minutes for me to get everything put away, and she starts screaming at me saying that it’s not fair that I won't let her use my car, that I’ve let her borrow it before, and I tried explaining that since the insurance on the car is in my moms name that I am not allowed to let her drive it in case there happened to be an accident (if there was an accident and someone else was driving, even one of my brothers, the insurance wouldn't cover the damages, only my mom and I were allowed to drive the car) I kept trying to explain that it wasn't a good idea, simply because I didn't want my mom to yell at me, and just thinking about it was making me nervous, so I was telling her ""I can give you rides, but you can't drive"" she just kept responding with stuff saying I'm a selfish bitch, and I'm being a cunt because I won't let borrow MY car. I told my mom and she said that I did the right thing, but I can't seem to get the nagging feeling out of my head that I was being cunty and selfish, but I just didn't want my mom to yell at me.

c292cr	2019-06-18 22:46:34	ilikesquirrelsalot	AITA for cutting ties with my dad if he doesn't come to my wedding?	"

My parents divorced when I was 2 and my mom got full custody. My dad sometimes visited when I was a kid, but he never pursued a relationship with me growing up, so we never really had a connection. My mom was a single mum for almost 10 years and had to bring him to court several times to pay child support. This is going to be relevant later. 

This situation affected me a lot and I was very happy when he reached out when I turned 18 and wanted to reconnect in 2016. I felt like this was a chance at fixing things. But after a few months things started going downhill.

We started going out, talking and I genuinely felt like we had started building a good father-daughter relationship. I continued to meet with him throughout the years even though I saw some signs that he wasn't fully invested in making things right, that is forgetting he said we'd meet on a certain weekend, asking me to come to his house because he is tired, doesn't feel like going our or doesn't have money to go out and so on. I really wanted to have a relationship with him and I wasnt going to rub all the things he did wrong in his face.

Last year he decided he won't pay child support anymore, even though he is obliged by the law in our country to do so until I finish my education, even after I turn 18. He never said anything, but continued talking to me like nothing happened. After a few months of not receiving the money, I told him it would have been nice of him to let me know. He just shrugged it off and even though it bothered me a lot, I didn't bring it up again because honestly I do not depend on this money. I technically have the right to sue him, but we are doing okay financially. He hinted at the fact that he didn't have much money and even though I let it go again. 

That was until I found out he got married without telling me. He still to this day hasn't told me that he got married, even thought it's been two years. Long story short, he had been dating this lady for almost 7 years and when I went to visit them last summer I noticed that they were wearing wedding bands. So I went online and checked the online marriage records to find out that they had gotten married in 2017.

Now, I'm 21 and engaged to the best man in the whole world. My fiance and I moved in together 2 years ago and moved to the UK. My dad works in France, so I told him that we plan on getting married next year and we want to have our wedding here. He told me that he doesn't know if he's going to be able to attend in this case, even though a ticket would cost around £50. I got very upset, because I really wanted him to be there. I've been trying so hard to be the perfect daughter, to connect with him, to compensate for the time he had lost, for all the birthdays he failed to attend - all of them since I was 2 up until 18. I feel so dumb for trying so hard and this is the last straw. I feel so hurt and tired if trying so hard.

AITA?

EDIT 1

And I really don't want to make up with my ex-gf when I think rationally but the passion which is still alive after all these months makes me want to get back to her.

When we left the party we were going the same way, but when we reached the busstop, the guy said that he didn't want to go home and that he would rather just find a place to sleep. I understood the hint and offered him to sleep at my place which was close to the party. 

I just want to make it clear that I was fully aware that he intended to have sex with me and I consented to it.

The day after he left early because I had plans with some friends and we agreed that we would text each other.

We flirted a bit over text, but I soon realized that I wasn't really into him, so when he asked me out I would make up some sort of excuse. Then, in December he wrote in a metaphor that he would really want to have sex with me again, and I told him I was not interested.

After that I didn't hear from him in quite some time and kind of hoped that he had forgotten about me. But then he wrote to me this May, and I made friendly conversation, because I don't want to be rude and ignore him. He then turned the conversation back to the time we had sex and asked to see me again. I then told him that I was kind of confused about what he wanted from me and that I'm not interested in seeing him again.

I thought I made myself clear, but he's been texting me on/off ever since and I've kept telling him that I'm not interested. Today, however, he wrote that I owe him see him again and that he kind of expected me to give him a kiss and a hug, which I really don't want to do.

A few days ago, my son ( 7 y/o ) and I went to a diner in the Boston area to commemorate him winning an award on his last day of school. Food was decent. As we’re finishing up, our waitress informs me that their credit card machine has broken down and they’re only accepting cash until they can fix it. Only issue? I have no cash. It’ll be fine though, right? I can just wait until they fix it, right? Nope. I inform our waitress that, unfortunately, I don’t have any cash on me and I’m not sure what to do. She tells me it’s no big deal, but she “needs the payment as soon as she can get it”, and that there’s an ATM across the street. Oh, okay, perfect! The catch? They want me to leave my 7 YEAR OLD, ALONE, in the restaurant, so as to prove I’m not dining and dashing. I kindly let this lady know that there’s absolutely no way I’m going to leave him alone; god forbid, in some shady looking diner right next to the bustling city. She gets mad and calls her manager who threatens to call the cops on me for not paying. I told her to go right ahead, because I wasn’t going anywhere in the area without my son by my side. Eventually, though, we worked it out and one of the hostesses walked with us across the street while I withdrew the cash for our meal. Never going there again.
I talked to my husband later that night who told me the entire situation could’ve been avoided if I had just left my son in the restaurant and not been a “stubborn asshole”. I feel like what I did was right, I don’t think I’d be able to live with myself if anything happened to my son.

This person, let's call her H, does UX for our projects and her job involves creating prototypes for all new features we're planning on launching before anything actually is done, meaning everything new has to go through her, so needless to say her job is important for the rest of us. 

&#x200B;

Well, yesterday I heard another coworker saying something like ""hey, are you really doing your college assignment here?"", to which she replied: ""studying is part of the job"". The conversation went on in a casual manner, other colleagues chipped in with their opinions, we all laughed about it and eventually the conversation died down. 

&#x200B;

I heard her saying things like that before and I really disagree with the idea, but never said anything, so I felt it was the right thing to maybe give her a piece of constructive advice by telling her (in private, via Slack) it was really not cool to be doing these things at work, of course, we all read stuff about technology or the news, or even go on reddit and shitpost a little, but focusing on unrelated activities for such a long time wasn't something any company would pay her to do. 

&#x200B;

She got really upset, picked up her things, came to my desk and told me in a sassy way: ""fyi, I finished all my tasks for the week"", which she obviously didn't because I was actually looking at everyone's tasks on Trello board and there were several that weren't even started by her. I asked her: ""what about these?"", she told me: ""I'm gonna start this one tomorrow"", turned around and left. Yeah. She left in the middle of the shift just like that.

I had it all planned how I was going to do it as well.  She abruptly said she didn't love me.

But the next day she completely removed me from her life. I don't see her now she don't message me.
I messaged her once in the last month to see how she was and I didn't get a reply so I left it.

I have not messaged or spoke to her since.

First things first, I'm 13, so sorry if I make any stupid mistakes here. Tl:Dr at bottom

I've shared a room with older brother for my entire life. A few years ago, my parents told me that they were getting the attic renovated and I could move up when it was done. They also said that it would be done by Christmas of that year. So Christmas comes and so far we have a hole in the bathroom ceiling and a few basic supports. They tell me they're sorry and it'll be done by the summer holidays. Same thing happens with them delaying the deadline by 6 months until this year. I tell my parents that I'd really like it done by my birthday (late April) as it might be the last big hangout before the end of primary school (middle school I think). They tell me they'll try. Cut to march, not much progress has been made. They finally up their game and hire some guys to do it for them.

So at this point there's stairs and a floor and they're asking me what color I want to paint the room. I choose a dark blue but they don't like it. At this point I'm fed up with them and just want the room. After weeks of nagging and pestering I finally pick a lighter shade of blue. Cut to this morning, I come home from school and my mom tells me she painted the walls and is currently painting the ceiling. I go up and she's painted the room WAY lighter than I wanted I tell her this and she's like ""oh I must have gotten the wrong shade.""

At this point my gran comes over to bring my younger brother to this toystore for his birthday and she asks what's up. I tell her the situation and she says she'll pick up the right paint while she's in town. So she comes back with the paint and my mom let's me paint a wall. The paint looks great on the wall and matches the ceiling well. I asked if we can paint the rest. She tells me that she thinks it's too dark and I'm not allowed paint the rest the same. I get mad and tell her I don't want the walls the color that she ""accidentally"" painted them and storm off. On my way out my mom calls me really ungrateful for all the work she did.

So for the past month or so, I've been having my exams. One of my problems is that I tend to stress eat, especially during exams and i've been staying at home a lot to study and don't have the time for sport or even going out. As a result, I've put on a few kilos(like 3 or 4) but I don't think it's really noticeable. I'm 5'10 and 150 pounds and my bmi is like 23(24.9+ is overweight).

During my exams, my mom took me to the doctor once cos i had a mild fever and since I'm a teenager, the doctor checked my weight and said my weight's gone up slightly but it's nothing threatening. Ever since then, my mom's been making comments on my weight. Like she says ""you shouldn't eat that even if you're stressed cos you're gonna have to burn it eventually' and ""you're getting fat"" in normal conversation.

My sister came back from uni and she's really been working out a lot(like she has abs). She told my mom when she saw me that she thinks i've gained some weight. I think she meant this in a sort of 'he needs to work out a bit soon' tone which is fair but she was a lot chubbier than me when she was my age and my mom said nothing to her and even supported her . After she left, my mom started telling me that my sister started noticing that I'm getting chubbier and that ""I'm gonna have a lot of work cut out for me"".

So I have eczema on my arms but in quite an extreme and painful way (when it is bad it will leak though my shirts and bleed randomly through the day). I've never had an issue with it unless I live with animals or smokers. The rule in our flat when we moved in was that we wouldn't smoke cigs in the flat but they could smoke a joint out of their windows and I wouldn't care as long as it never affected me. They both smoke cigarettes in their rooms regularly and my skin has gone through periods of better and worse over the year.  This year I am moving city and one flatmate wants to come with me, this saves me like hundreds a month in rent and I really want to live together again but I mentioned I'd need her to not smoke anything in the flat ever, not even once. She said this was totally unreasonable since we are on the 15th floor and she cant smoke joints on the street. I dont want to say she can smoke weed in her room (which my skin is better with) because I said that this year and it turned into me comming into her room every month asking if she would mind not smoking cigarettes in there. She knows that weed from a bong doesnt give me reactions like cig smoke does and she says im being unreasonable since it wouldn't actually affect me. She also pointed out that my eczema could come from stress or bed sheets or anything since it is always worse when I am stressed, although this is true i just dont have the same problem when I visit my parents, it doesnt necessarily mean it's the smoke but its likely it is. I dont trust her to only smoke weed in there and I dont want to be constantly trying to figure out if it smells like weed or Tabacco. And trying to figure out if she smoked while i was out and that's why I'm breaking out or if its something else. I dont want to loose a good flatmate but I'm sick of putting my health on the back burner for someones recreation. Am I being unreasonable?		1	0

To this he responded that I was being crazy and stupid and acting like a good digger I wouldn't have felt like this but only 2 months ago it was also his 21 and I went all out he had been complaining that he didn't have a good enough gaming set up so I bought him a brand new one fully loaded it took months of saving to be able to afford it as it cost well over 1500$ I feel he has taken advantage of me as I know he has spent far more on gifts for other people in his life like freinds and fmaily so money isn't the issue I just feel I am not a big part of his life.

c28qu4	2019-06-18 22:18:07	MickeyTRN	AITA for not wishing my Veteran father a happy Memorial Day?	"First, some background.  I (20f) do not have a great relationship with my father.  Without going into too much detail, he was emotionally manipulative and verbally abusive to me and my older sister all throughout our childhoods, and would sometimes up and leave for days at a time without telling any of us where he went.  And that is honestly just the tip of the shit-iceberg.  

Now, my father served in the Persian Gulf War and is considered to be 100% disabled due to his severe Post-Traumatic Stress disorder.  I realize that a lot of his abusive actions growing up stemmed from this and other untreated psychological issues he was suffering with at the time (and I am happy to say that he has since begun to get help), but even though he is getting better and trying to make amends the best he can, it's hard to trust him again, especially since he has a habit of falling back into his manipulative ways when he feels guilty or upset.  I respect his service and his efforts to get better, it's just going to take time to trust him enough to get close with him again.  

So, due to this strained relationship, I don't really contact him a lot, but I do, of course, wish him well on Holidays, especially Veteran's Day.  This Memorial Day, I was in another state, visiting my older sister, and we were busy most of the day.  Night time rolled around and we both considered sending him a Happy Memorial Day text, but we weren't sure if it was appropriate.  After all, Memorial Day is meant to be a day on which to honor those who died in battle which, obviously, our father did not.  After talking it over with each other and even asking our Mom's input, we decided that Memorial Day wasn't a holiday that pertained to him and didn't send a text.  

Fast forwards a few days, I am back in my home state, and our father calls both of us separately and almost immediately starts saying things along the lines of: ""I killed three men to keep you all safe and I don't even get a text from my children, but who cares, right?  Not like it really matters...""  and ""You know, three civilians thanked me for my service that day.  Not my offspring, but grateful...""  I apologized for hurting his feelings and tried to explain our way of thinking, but he just said ""that's bullshit and you know it.""  

After an awkward subject change and a hurried goodbye, I hung up and not an hour later received a text from my older sister detailing almost the exact same situation that I experienced.  We were both torn.  I don't think he handled it in exactly the right way, but it still probably hurt not to hear from two of your children on a military holiday.  But at the same time, I still feel like the holiday wasn't really about him.  I don't know, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c28qs8	2019-06-18 22:17:57	sadgallah_aita	AITA for causing my Mum to get fired from our workplace?	"Mum's been working in a government job for 20+ years. Pretty much the same job/area the whole time.

After working private industry for the past 5 years, I moved into a government role where I'm now overseeing people including my Mum. I've been in this role 8ish months.

Mum has always called me a variety of those affectionate pet names parents call their kids. I hate most of them and have told her that as long as I can remember. There are one or two I'm grudgingly ok with but only in a private/family environment. I really just prefer being called by my name and not a pet name.

In particular, I really don't like this in in a work environment. It makes me uncomfortable and I feel like I'm not being respected in a professional capacity at work. So, I confronted her about it when I visited my parents on a weekend. I told her I wanted it to stop at work. Mum got really defensive about it, ""I'm doing it out of love, it's not malicious"", ""It's a habit I've done it all your life, it's too hard to break now"", ""Stop trying to make an issue where there is none"". For a few weeks at work I privately called her out on it when I could. This did not stop it at work.

I decided to take it to HR. Lodged an initial complaint and was told they'd look into it. It kept happening, so I privately confronted her again and that still didn't cause her to stop. So, I went to HR again. This happened over a few months and I noticed some of her colleagues/friends also sometimes called me those pet names.

After a few months of this, Mum didn't come into work (this was a few weeks ago). I visited my parents on the weekend. They chucked a wobbly at me and I copped it! ""How can you do this to you mother!?"" ""Why can't you understand that those names are out of love?"" ""You mother's too old to find a job!"" ""What your mother did was not harassment!""

I feel really guilty about this. If I kept my mouth shut and didn't complain to HR, mum would still be working there. But then again I feel like, at work, I shouldn't have to put up with being called pet names I hate even if it is from my mum.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR summary:** Worked with my mum in a govt. job. She has always called me pet names and I really hate it. She did this at work and I couldn't get her to stop it at work even after addressing the issue privately multiple times. Went to HR about it. Mum eventually got fired for harassment."

c28q8t	2019-06-18 22:16:41	usmanwar	WIBTA for notifying my neighbor’s family for their father smoking?	So my neighbors’ father is around his 60s and spends a lot of his time outside smoking cigarettes. He has recently had a lot of health issues that have stemmed from smoking. (heart, lungs) A couple of weeks ago he had a really bad scare and spent several nights in the hospital. Obviously after this, his doctors have restricted him from smoking completely. His wife told my mom to notify her if we see him smoking outside at anytime although I’m not sure if this was a joke or not. Anyway, I didn’t see him smoking for a week until today. I’m unsure of whether I would be an asshole to him if I told his family since I don’t know his exact and current medical condition and he is free to do what he wishes.		0	0
c28q6j	2019-06-18 22:16:31		AITA: for getting a girl expelled ?	"sorry for the click-baity title but i promise the story isn't that weird, not a throw-away cuz i'm not ashamed of who i am 

cast:

Y: me

K: best friend 

Ch: expelled girl

so this happened at the start of the year, after the 1st week, we get a new female student, because there was no room she had to be seated behind me and K, now keep in mind that me and K are pretty chill dudes, we get along with everyone in class, and we're very polite and we don't hesitate to strike a conversation.

so i start talking to this girl, i find out that we have the same walk to our homes, just 3 blocks away from eachother.

over the next few weeks i start talking to Ch more and more, even sitting with her on Science class (not usual/not in the same group with K)

after a while, she starts hinting that she's falling for me, i ignore her remarks cuz i think she's joking, a little about myself, i'm an acceptable looking dude, like a 7-8/10 but wasn't really the attention center of girls, probably because of my weird behavior, but who knows really ?

anyways K gets a girlfriend, and so do i (my now ex) and i can see that Ch isn't taking it well that i don't share her feelings, come exam days, she started exhibiting Stalker-y behavior, it finally culminating in trying to force herself upon myself, even successfully sharing a kiss on the lips with me (in front of our whole class), keep in mind:

-i had a gf at the time

-Ch was 18 at the time, i was 16

-in no way did i feel any attraction or affection towards her other than wanting to stay friends

i was ready to leave all that behind us and just stay friends with her, but no...the bitch does it again so i see no choice but to report her to the school administration, stuff is handled quickly and she gets expelled, her only other friend in school other than myself is giving me dirty eyes, and i'm questioning if i did the right thing"		1	0
c28pox	2019-06-18 22:15:21	evanjw90	AITA for not wanting to be in a relationship with a girl I possibly got pregnant	"I (29 M) met a girl (19 F) a couple months ago, and we hit it off instantly. It turned into a sexual relationship halfway through our first date, and we were both into rougher stuff, so it was amazing. Quickly we started staying the night with each other, and one morning waking up at hers, she asked if I'd like to take some acid with her and go to the beach. Now I hadn't done anything outside smoking cannabis for the last 11 years or so, but she honestly made me feel so great and I didn't have work or my son that day, so decided to do it. During that trip, she began to touch me sexually, and I was really too far gone to comprehend what was going on, but knew it felt great and just went with it. We did not use protection that night. *This is where it gets to the drama.*

Long story short, she had lied and told me she was 22. She definitely gave me no reason to think she was lying. Up to this point, we had gone out to bars, restaurants where they checked her ID, and had some stay in nights where she brought the booze and cannabis, and I made dinner. No red flags telling me she was three years younger so far. This went on for about six weeks until she started getting late night phone calls. We agreed we were not boyfriend and girlfriend or in a relationship, so I never pryed into knowing what was going on. That is until about two and a half weeks ago, where she out of the blue tells.me she needed her stuff back from my house, and that she was going to get back with her ex boyfriend. I just kinda felt it sucked because we were having a lot of fun together, but I sucked it up and just told her farewell and take care. Well, she had asked me during that phone call if her coin purse was anywhere at my house because it had her debit card in it. I look and find it behind my dresser. I peer inside to check if her debit cards are inside, and I find her set of IDs. Her real one showing she was born in 2000, and her fake saying 1997. 

She came by to pick it up, and I confronted her wanting to know why she'd lie about her age like that. Her response is what made me not care about not seeing her any longer: ""Why the fucks it matter? I'm done with you anyway and we both got what we needed."" I didn't retort and just let her leave. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I get a phone call after not hearing from her for almost three weeks. She's pregnant. I told her it's been long enough where it could be her boyfriend's, and she is adamant that it could only be mine. I ask what she wants to do (her body her choice 100%), and she says she doesn't know. I explain to her there is absolutely no way I would want to be with anyone who acted the way she did, but I would support the child of it's mine, and also go with her for an abortion if that's also what she chooses, but in no way will we have a relationship together. She got upset, called me an asshole, told me I was a dead beat, etc. My friends are divided saying it was one mistake and she was just being stupid, and half are saying that's life."

"So when I’m at places and the bathroom is crowded, I always use the family bathroom because I enjoy the privacy and quite. I usually let families go in front of me if there’s a line.

"For some context, my parents gifted my brother and his wife their former four bedroom home as a wedding/baby shower gift. My mother absolutely loved this house, we lived there for the last part of my teen years. Growing up the house was always spotless, if we made a mess we were expected to clean it up and we did our own laundry, dishes, etc. My brother and SIL were ecstatic they got a home they could raise their family in mortgage free.

My SIL invited me over for lunch a few days ago and I decided to bring my mother along. When we got to the house their lawn was a bit of a mess but no big deal, not everyone has time to do yard work, especially with a baby. When we went inside my mom just about burst into tears. The walls and carpet were noticeably dirty, the kitchen was awful with piled dishes and food left over night on the stove, the tiled floor had spilled baby food crusting over, laundry was spilling out from the laundry room and into the hall, there were piles of papers and boxes everywhere. It looked like the start of a hoarding problem. I'm not a clean freak, I can be very lazy at times, but I would never let my mess get to the level I saw at my brother's house.

After we left my mom cried and said she couldn't believe the house had been treated like that and now she's regretting not selling the house and giving them the proceeds to buy their own so she wouldn't have to watch her former dream home become a dirty wreck and how it's not safe for a baby to be in an environment so dirty.

c28jvv	2019-06-18 22:01:34	Whoevers	WIBTA for being naked in my apartment in view of other people?	"First off, I'd like to establish that I am in my full legal right to be naked in my apartment. This is not the issue. I'm not talking about whether I CAN do this, I'm asking whether I SHOULD.

Secondly, some people will inevitably say some sexist bullshit, but I ask you to revers the genders (you mostly will be assuming people are) and see if it still sounds OK.

So, I live on the 4th floor with no AC. This is mostly fine by me. So far, I just dealt with the summer heat by not wearing clothes. However, this year a building is being constructed over the road in front of the plot of the apartment building I live in. (So the building being built is maybe 10m-20m away.) 

This means that if I would continue walking around naked, I would be periodically exposing myself to the construction worker, who, mind you, have no choice in being there, assuming they want to keep on being employed. What I'm pointing out here, is that they have no real choice in being exposed to me.

I feel, essentially flashing people without their consent, would most definitely make me an asshole despite being in my legal right to do so. I figure plain undergarments is the best solution; keeps me from melting and inadvertently sexually harassing workers. I'd still like to get other people's opinions on this.

I am a part of a discord server from a game we all started on. This discord server has separate channels for different games and a general channel. Now generally myself and my friend go to the channel for the game we're playing so we can talk about the game consistently while we play. 

&#x200B;

Here's the issue, my friends will often come in while playing other games to talk to us, but in reality they just talk about whatever game(s) they are playing at the time and the result is that those of us who were already in the channel using it for the game we're playing just don't speak. At all. We will just sit there in silence while everyone else talks about the game they're playing. Before anyone asks, I have voiced this opinion numerous times. Anyone who pays any attention to what I say on discord and certainly my friends should already be aware of this. 

&#x200B;

I understand that they just want to chat to me, and they are very good friends, but I just get so annoyed by the end of it I just go off for the night. Cause I have done the alternative of move channels to a different one and then people come into the channel and complain.

c28j5n	2019-06-18 21:59:54	BostonBlackCat	"WIBTA if I wore a ""nicer"" dress than the bride at a wedding?"	"Going to a wedding next month. The bride is a lovely, laid back girl, not a bridezilla, who just wants her loves ones to celebrate with her; she is not the kind to get jealous of someone because she thinks of it as ""her day,"" but she is a lovely person and I want to avoid any wedding faux pas.


I have a beautiful designer dress that I very rarely have a chance to wear, and the colors actually suit the theme of the wedding very well. It is not flashy, not white, not bright colored, not overly formal, and not revealing. 

However, it is beautifully embroidered and tailored dress with exquisite attention to detail. It definitely isn't anywhere near as attention getting as a bridal gown, but I expect it will be significantly better tailored/designed and expensive looking than her wedding dress, as I know she is going for a simpler look and not a very fancy gown. It's not a ""head turner"" dress but I definitely get lots of comments on it, especially people who know fashion and design. 

I am not in the wedding party but am doing a reading at the ceremony.

I'd like to wear it, but not if it could be interpreted as me attempting to outshine / take attention away from her.  She's younger and prettier than me, and I really don't think my dress would be an issue or steal her thunder, but people can get so touchy about weddings I don't want to risk a misstep. 

WIBTA if I wore this dress? I would just ask her but she's such a nice girl, and I think she'd tell me not to worry about it regardless of how she actually felt (or other people would take it).


ETA: the bride and most (if not all) of the guests are in the same financial class as me or higher. She definitely could have an expensive designer wedding dress if she wanted. I had assumed she would be wearing a very elaborate dress like her sister did at her own wedding, but just found out she is going for a simpler style. Finding this out is now making me second guess my own dress. Dress code is semi formal.

UPDATE: I really don't think the bride would be truthful if I asked her directly, she would just say anything I want is fine. However, I'm going to reach out to the maid of honor with a picture and ask her if she thinks it works with the wedding mottif. I also will send her a picture of a plainer dress and ask if it might be better for me to do the plainer dress at the ceremony and the fancier one at the reception, or just the plainer one in general, and let her decide for me.

c28gxm	2019-06-18 21:55:10	absurdchrono	AITA for being frustrated with my move?	"Recently, me and my fiancée moved from Missouri to Arizona. She is from Arizona, I'm from Missouri, and the move itself isn't an issue- I'm not angry that she wanted to be close to family again, in fact I was very supportive and excited for the move (i personally didn't like the city we were living in, and was eager to get away), and when she said she wasn't happy with Missouri, I was more than elated to give her what she asked for. The catch is, we would be moving in with her mom while we both found jobs and got situated, and she tends to be an incredibly overbearing, nosey, and manipulative individual.  


I was independent for 5 years, and I find the house rules stifling and oppressive, but I grin and bear it because I know I have to follow the rules while I'm here. I had to sell my vehicle and am now without any sort of freedom I was once accustomed to, and I sequester myself in the bedroom all day while I look for jobs, because I have literal panic attacks at the thought of having to hear my soon to be MIL's complaints- it feels like no matter what I do, I'm being watched, scrutinized, and it's driving me insane.  To top it all off, my fiancée has been spending all her time with her family since we got here, instead of hanging with me she'll often run off to her mom's bedroom to watch cable, leaving me alone for most of the day. I don't really have a problem with that, but she knows how I feel, and since I don't know anyone here, I'm just alone, by myself, with no capability of going out and making friends.

My girlfriend of three months threw away something special to me but may appear as trash to others. In my car, ever since I got my car, I keep all my old air fresheners. I must have 25 or 30 hanging up on my rear-view mirror right now. Even if their scent is gone, at least a little remains and I like how it smells and looks. I consider it good luck.

It's a tradition my father started when I was born (and is still doing) although the rules are ditch them when switching cars. As dumb as it sounds to have rules for this, you can add them but not take them off, so new car is a clean slate.

I told my girlfriend it was important to me but didn't go further. I guess she forgot because she threw them all out in the trash that was taken earlier today. I got angry, of course, but not yelling. More I don't want to talk to or see her until I've stewed in my emotions a little.

My friend (22M) is engaged to a woman (27F). She is insufferable, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. My friend has expressed so many concerns about her to me already, such as how controlling she is.

They argue quite a bit, and it doesn't seem like a partnership.. more like, he's a box to check off her list and part of her life plan. 

This woman is a naysayer, she's controlling, she dictates everything he does. She even controls his job... She convinced him to quit a job he loved and get a different job because she didn't like the company he worked for.


I'm worried he will marry this woman only to suffer and either get a divorce, or live a shitty life having settled for someone so terrible. He's expressed to me before he might have rushed into a proposal, because she was the first woman he slept with and he's anxious for marriage and kids.

c28cjy	2019-06-18 21:44:54		AITA for callingout a family friend for being rude about my family’s dietary choices?	"So, a little backstory. My family is Indian-American and I (24F) and my mother are vegetarians (religious reasons for my mom and I was raised that way so now it’s a habit for me). We are both really uncomfortable with cooking meat in our home and we do 99% of the cooking at home.  My dad, who is of a different religion, knows this and chooses to not eat meat at home out of respect for us. When we are out, my mom usually encourages my dad to order meat so he doesn’t miss out on too much. 

We are currently on a vacation with a couple of my dad’s college friends and their wives. A bunch of ppl in the group are also vegetarian so we end up going to places where there are plenty of great options for all of us. For most of the vacation, one of my dad’s friends and his wife who have been super on about the fact that they eat and LOVE meat. The guy of the couple had a 50% coronary block that has forced him to eat at least a few veggies per meal but he constantly complains about how gross and awful it is. He and his wife non jokingly tell other vegetarians at every meal that “they should try the lamb/mutton/chicken, they’re really missing out”. And we each politely decline every time. They constantly ask my mom and me “how we could possibly survive on a vegetarian diet” and sometimes I let it go but sometimes I would politely say “well, it’s a matter of taste, I really find meat unappetizing/gross so to each their own”. 

Last night at dinner, we ordered a fabulous jackfruit biryani and every single vegetarian and the other omnivores loved it, but of course, these two people had to be like “ugh no taste compared to meat! This is so gross”. My dad took a bit of their lamb and loved it, and they started asking him about how he managed to stay vegetarian at home. The guy was tipsy and started going in on my mom, saying things like “I feel like you brainwashed him into eating only vegetarian food and took him away from his roots” and my dad, with things like “seriously, honestly tell me any good your wife makes for you matches up to this meat”. I got visibly upset, so another member of the group was like “oh don’t take him seriously, he’s drunk” and I responded to her, within earshot of drunk man+wife “yes I know, but it’s still rude”. Wife got all high and mighty and was like “how is it rude to ask this?!?” And her husband just fell silent. I just shook my head, shifted my attention to the other end of the table, and they ended up eating the rest of the meal in silence. 

My dad asked me to apologize and I honestly would have if they’d been calling out MY dietary choices. But calling out my parents’ sacrifices for each other, which is the whole basis of their interreligious relationship, as “brainwashing”, was out of bounds. I asked my mom and she said they had it coming (they’ve been obnoxious about multiple things to her this weekend) and that we should all just move forward. AITA for calling them out?"

c28c5v	2019-06-18 21:44:07	AppleProStand	AITA for yelling at my Sis-in-Law(35) with two kids and third on the way to FIGURE IT OUT!?	"Couple months ago my sis-in-law announced a 3rd child on the way.  Her kids are two and six.  She is currently working as a nurse with a 3x12 schedule.  Her husband works a normal 9-5 with all the bells and whistles and even has the ability to work from home.  The two of them together earn at the top end of middle class income.  They have three cars on the newer end which are all financed:  SUV, Van, and a weekend sports car.  They moved into a larger house last year - 2000 sqft to a 4,500 sqft.  They do NOT cook and eat at home.  They go out on weeknights and weekends to always try the newest hole in the wall that just opened up.  The sis-in-law has crippling credit card debt as she has a pattern of being irresponsible with money, approximately $25K.  She also has an outstanding student loan that has not been paid off that my wife signed for.  Cherry on top:  My wife quit her job at one point to watch her first born because she and the husband were having money issues.  I remained quiet as it was her family and I trusted she knew what she was doing.  Worst part?  I’ve had to deal with this type of behavior for the last seven years where we are always picking up the tab or buying the kids clothes because they NEED it.  We have also loaned them quite a bit of money which we’ll probably never see.

&nbsp;

Last week she and the hubby had some time to kill before heading over to a friend's pool party.  Sis in law immediately begins complaining about money and how she is so tired and hasn't had a moment to rest all week.  I started out calmly by asking her why don’t you create a budget for both time management and money?  It was as if I nudged a ripe pimple.  She blew up accusing me of not knowing how difficult her life is and to stay in my lane.  That was the red button – With the fury of a thousand Ned Flanders I let seven years of built up frustration spear her in the eyeballs.  Short of the long is I informed her of her shit habits with time and money and she needs to lock it up especially with a third child on the way and to figure her shit out because we are not going to be around forever.  It is unfair to ask even family for help when you yourself have not exhausted all options to cut costs and do your best to make do and live within your means.

&nbsp;

Wife thought I was an asshole and mean.  I disagree – no one has ever said anything to her and the underlying behavior needs to be corrected as it’s impacting everyone.  Before anyone asks, the kids were not present.  Sidenote:  My wife and I are savers and try to put away as much as possible for early retirement.  We have a goal in mind.  This has been taking away from it for the last seven years.

&nbsp;

**Reddit AM I THE ASSHOLE?**

&nbsp;

**Edit:**  for those saying no one wants unsolicited advice, she has come crying to us about how to consolidate her debt and hide it from her husband.  Twice actually.

&nbsp;

**Edit2:**  For those wanting to know the aftermath

&nbsp;

Sis-in-law and Brother-in-law have decided to ban me from seeing their children. I'm upset about it but I will move on. They took to social media and I'm now a clown with no love for family. They left out quite a few details and painted me as someone who doesn't understand what it means to be family because apparently you always help family no matter what. Apparently if she has a miscarriage I'm somehow responsible now. I've decided not to fight back. Anyone that knows my wife and I also knows how much we have helped. They are digging their own graves and I'm going to let them.

&nbsp; 

I tried speaking to my wife but she was upset so I decided to hand write a letter to her. I slipped it in her work bag as she was leaving for work. The letter was NOT an ultimatum. The contents of the letter outlined how much we have done in the last seven years with INCREASING frequency. She called me a few hours later and decided to take a half day off work to come home and talk to me. She walked through the door and gave me a hug and said she spoke with her sister. As of today we are 100% cutting them off from any type of help. This means no more money and more importantly... TIME. She cried and claimed it was one of the most difficult things she has done as it meant she had to accept her sister was taking advantage of her all this time. I told my wife lets just leave it as everyone is to blame. I'm sure if we had nipped it in the bud early on this would not have snowballed as much as it has. She felt much better with that explanation.

c28bm0	2019-06-18 21:42:48	lurkandsmirk29	AITA for changing my wife’s clothing sizes without telling her?	"My wife has gained some weight over the last year, and keeps beating herself up over it. She’s always sadly talking about her sizes and calling herself too big. She lost her excitement with shopping and a few months ago I guess I made a step to change that.

She’s always asking me to get things for her while she’s in the dressing room, new sizes etc. She told me to get a pair of jean shorts for her in a size 6 (this size is too small for her now by a lot. She’s kind of in denial about this and always asks for a size 6 and then gets very upset when it won’t fit at all. She’s more of a size 10 or 12 now. )

I don’t know... I got a bigger size and changed the sticker on the jeans so it said size 6. When it fit she was so happy and kept showing me and saying she’s so proud. She said she must have lost weight but doesn’t know what she did. She bought them feeling very confident with herself. When we got home, I cut the tag off the shorts. 

I didn’t mean to but a few times after that I did it again. I guess it was part wanting to see my wife happy and part not knowing how to deal with the same meltdown happening every time. She looks really beautiful even if she gained some weight. I kept doing this and only recently did she realize that the tags on her clothes are missing. She asked me about it and I said I didn’t know, maybe the store doesn’t use them, but she googled the store and proved they did. 

I had to come clean and now she’s furious. She keeps saying I’m an asshole and treating her like an idiot, lied to her, stuff like that. My heart is broken too. We haven’t spoken in days.

AITA?

EDIT: I can’t believe this became so big and I feel way too overwhelmed. Hard for me not to delete the post because some people are being very cruel to me and sometimes also to my wife. Insulting her doesn’t make me feel better and I don’t know I feel like I understand the mistake I made but not everything I’m seeing here helped me get there.

My wife has a super close friend.  They grew up together (in a different country). 

Friend, let's call F, has three kids, raging from 4ish to 8ish.  F left her home country to live in our country as her husband was batshit nuts and extremely abusive.

Because my wife lives here now (it is a developed, place), F thought she should move here.

So she did and is making her life here. 

Few things, F doesn't speak nearly any English (yet) kids are learning but still a long way to go.

Oldest kid has a learning problem (obviously due to crazy violent husband), middle kid is fluent already and easy going, the youngest has a behavioural issue and throws crazy tantrums often.

F and kids come to my house about once a month for the weekend.  My wife is F's only real family here so i get it.. She needs to be with her friend and it's basically like being at families house... I understand completely. 

They have a great time together every time.  The kids too,including my daughter.

Kicker is F's kids drive me insane... Im pretty patient but dammit her kids are nuts and I finally realized i get so angry not because of the kids but because F doesn't do anything... Just let's them run wild and my daughter is definitely picking up on their mannerisms, including F's youngest's tantrums. Luckily mine doesn't understand what that is yet but she does mimic that behaviour.

So they were at my house recently and we were planning on going out and the kids were trying to play with my neighbours dog through the fence (i don't know him well and we are not friends)... I told the kids to leave the dog alone and to play with our treehouse etc.  As I don't want the kids getting bit or the owner getting mad... Keep in mind, F is nowhere to be found..

Anyways, my wife said i was being an asshole and that I'm always mean to the kids. 

Edit : I should add that if there is any time i feel my daughter is at risk, thus is when i get involved.  Sometimes, the youngest will take toys away from my daughter or push her so she can have what she wants.  I don't let that go... I get (I feel not mean)  involved just to ensure my daughter doesn't get bullied or taken advantage of. 

Also i will be the tough one if things are getting dangerous or my house is in danger... The kids have already painted nail polish on my couch and it's stained.  They swing things dangerously close to my daughter and i have to interject. 

Again, I'm more upset at the mom but i do understand that she can't handle everything as she would go nuts.

c289u6	2019-06-18 21:38:47	throwawaypreggoaita	AITA for not wanting husband to go help with family emergency	"This is a complicated one.

Important details:
I'm 6.5 months pregnant. We moved to a new apartment 7 months ago, and it's still not how I would like it. Husband is dealing with unexpected pregnancy by throwing himself into the family Amway business, swearing he's going to replace my income so I can quit my job and stay home. We're already financially stable, and it would not be the end of the world if I quit. He's nowhere near his goal, with only a couple of months left to go before baby. He's decided to take every opportunity to either ""work on the business"" or catch up with friends before the baby arrives. When he's not doing that, he's ""taking a break,"" spending hours playing PC games. This means he's gone or occupied a lot, and rarely seems to have time for me or the things we still need to do. Last weekend he flew to another city to play games with his former roommate all weekend. Same friend he already sets aside time for every Monday night to play games. I feel like he's finding excuses to run away from his responsibilities as husband and father. The only things I've asked him to research are car seats and strollers. Months later we still have neither.

We've also had a couple of big financial expenditures lately.  Bought a new (used) car for him because his old car was ready to cough out its engine. We also took an overseas babymoon (planned and booked prior to the car troubles). Again, financially stable, so these were okay. But I'm still trying to be cautious with any more large expenses.

HERE'S THE PROBLEM:
Husband's grandpa lives overseas, has fallen ill, and has been hospitalized for several weeks. MIL and FIL are already there to help. It's been slow, but Gpa is improving, and seems to be out of any immediate danger. This whole time, I've been ready to say, ""it's okay, go, you need to be with your family"" in the event of things taking a turn for the worst. Family is more important than a pricey plane ticket. But I feel like his parents have decided that everyone needs to fly in anyway and help out with other things. They decided that Husband should come over first (but not quite yet - they told him to wait a few weeks), and then his brother could come in August. Which makes me think this isn't such an emergency anymore. The red flag for me came last night when Husband told me he'd be able to ""meet people,"" which usually means ""find people to pitch the Amway business to."" His parents have a branch of their Amway business in this country, and I know he wants a part of it. Immediately my entire impression changed, and I feel like he's using this ""emergency"" as an excuse to run away from his responsibilities at home. We had a big fight over it, because now I can't help but doubt his intentions. MIL already told Gpa that Husband was coming, so now I feel like if I keep him from going, I could be the asshole that keeps a dying man from seeing his grandson one last time."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2879s	2019-06-18 21:32:56	throwaway67342888	AITA for not wanting a relationship with my dad?	"My mom had me when she was young. She and my biological father agreed that for whatever reason, he wasn't going to be in the picture. My mom then married someone else and did not tell me he hasn't my bio dad until I was 13. He was the only father I knew and for the sake of this post, I will just call him my dad, though I do have a relationship with my biological dad now too.

I never had a good relationship with my dad. Somehow I always knew that something wasn't right and I actually remember wishing he wasn't my real dad or that he and my mom would divorce. Well, both happened.

My parents divorced when I was about 14 and being a bratty teen, it was easier to just cut him out of my life since we never got along anyway. He would reach out to me and I would occasionally spend a holiday with him. I maybe saw him once a year and there were years where I didn't see him at all. I knew I was hurting him, but I just didn't want him in my life.

Fast forward to when I was 22 and in an abusive relationship. I finally realized I needed to move out of my ex's place and my dad took me in and let me live in his basement and I was very grateful. We both thought this would help our relationship. However, I hadn't lived with him since I was 14 and he treated me like a kid after I'd been living on my own essentially since college.

I wasn't allowed to have anybody over, I would get lectured about leaving cups in my room, etc. He found sleeping pills once (like Zquil) and accused me of abusing them. He opened my mail and found my birth control and freaked out thinking they were Plan B(???) and lectured me. And many other things that I can't remember.

Also while living with him I had a cat that wasn't allowed to be with his other animals and was forced to stay in the basement. Obviously the cat didn't like this and started peeing on the floor and would constantly cry at the door if I wasn't home.

When I first moved in, I was told I could stay as long as I needed in order to get back on my feet. I had a plan in place and was working on saving money until he kicked me out after less than 3 months for the above reasons. It's been a year now and I have yet to talk to him.

Well me and one of my friends got into some philosophical conversation and I mentioned how I recently got into reading, and how you can understand how the author thinks through their wordplay.

More convos and we start talking about books written by evil people. Eventually I mentioned wanting to read Mein Kampf, and then the girl my friend was with came into the convo with ""excuse me?!"" I explained that I'd want to read it to see how Hitler's thought process was, and she completely lost it, telling me how I'm an asshole for even considering to read a book written by a monster, and that you don't need to read his book to know that he was an evil person.

I tried explaining myself but she kept yelling at me (and our mutual friend), and stormed off with a ""have a good night."" I've never had anyone walk angrily away from me before so I didn't know how to react, and laughed nervously.

My friend saw this and said that wasn't cool, and that I mentioned Hitler for the sake of shock factor. I find this really weird, since everyone seemed fine when we were talking about Tex Watson's book (Charles Manson's 1st mate) right before Mein Kampf came up.

The night went on and eventually my friend gets a text from the girl stating that she's not associating herself with a Nazi-lover (irrelevant info but I'm Mexican and proud of my roots, so this caught me off-guard).

He asks me to apologize to just get this over with and I refuse under my girlfriend's advice, stating that there's nothing for me to be sorry about, and we leave.

This morning my gf brings it up again, asking if I really did want to read Mein Kampf and wasn't just being a douche. I said yes and I was not saying it to be an edgelord.

Well, AITA...for wanting to read Mein Kampf...for curiosity?

c285kt	2019-06-18 21:29:03	be_young_and_dumb	Aita for wanting to party in my youth and leting someone else look after my kid?	"I had my son at a really young age I was 17 and not married to my son's mother. I thought my life was over and that I couldn't be young anymore but my mother and my sons mother have been great he stays with his mom Monday to Thursday and I take him on over the weekend.
This aragment didn't really suit me as I still really wanted to part like an other 18 year old kid so a few months in I asked my mum to baby sit just one night so I could hang with some freinds. 
Once I came back that night she seemed to have had the time of her life as she said it made her feel young again she also offered to babysit again if needed at first this was a couple of times a month but over the past few months my mum has been watching my son on Friday and Saturday night allowing me to go out and party I am really thankful of this as it allows me to still live my life and not let one mistake ruin everything. 
But recently some freinds have came to me and said that I might be being an asshole and taking advantage of my mum I don't feel this is the case as I still see him during the day most of the times on Friday and Sunday and sometimes on a Saturday. I also feel it's good for my mum as she seems to like so am I the asshole reddit please be honest.

c2850y	2019-06-18 21:27:47	throwaway97436829	AITA for having doubts about my partner because of their age?	"So, to begin with the backstory of this, I wanna say that I’m fully aware that my choices were stupid. That’s largely part of why I have worries about me being the asshole in this situation.

I met “T” in January on an online writing platform (we’re both authors) and we hit it off immediately. We had common interests, and our views about just about everything line up perfectly. But this is when my choices started to mess up— I never asked for T’s age.

After about a week or two of knowing each other, I felt like a dick for not asking sooner. I dig myself into a deeper and deeper hole, until it just got way too long of us knowing each other for me to ask and it not be weird.

Throughout these past few months, I also never told T my age. However, I dropped hints that, I felt, made it obvious without needing to blurt out, “I’m 18.” For example, T knew I was a first year at my university. I sent T a picture of my birthday cake giant ‘18’ candles on top. T follows my instagram, which states clearly that I am 18.

All the while, the only hint I really had to go off of, was that T told me that they’d already graduated from university.

We’ve facetimed several times, T sends me pictures of themselves all the time, voice calls, and we follow each other on social media’s. But, T has a really young face, and I’d guessed that at the absolute most, they were 23 or 24.

Come to find out a few weeks ago, they are actually 29, turning 30 later this year. Ever since I found out about this, I’ve felt awful. I love them to death, but this age gap is just not something I’d ever envisioned myself being a part of.

I told them that it shocked me when they’d admitted their age, but their response was simply, “I didn’t say anything about it because I didn’t think you’d care. We’re both consenting adults, that’s all that matters to me.”

Since then, I can feel myself distancing from them, feeling like our relationship was built on dishonesty. I can’t help but feel like deep down, T knew that their age would bother me, and held it back because of that.

We’ll call him Joe(21). Joe has been a friend of mine since high school and recently he’s gotten into problems and was kicked out from his old roommates place because they were living with his friends’ parents house. I offered him to stay at my place while he tries to get back on his feet and get a place of his own. We agreed on 50/50 on rent. Roughly 300 dollars. So he moves in a week before rent was due and gave me a 100 dollars as a start up for staying. This was his first payment to me. A month goes by and rent comes up, he just landed a job as a rep but hasn’t gotten paid, I told him just pay me sometime before the next rent.(I make decent money so I had no issue paying the rent). Anyways, it’s now the 18th and he still hasn’t paid me back or even discussing it with me. Whenever I bring it up he says I’m “attacking him” and “I gotta be patient with him”. But he’s been at his job for almost a month now so you’d think he’d pay me by now right? Now since next rent is coming up i asked him again about the last month rent money but he’s continuing to act defensive? He’s going to be owing me 600 dollars by next month at this pace. I like him but he’s just irresponsible with his money at times. I’m not sure whether I should just wait and see if he does pay me back or to just kick him out now because I’ve been in this situation where the person I lived with just piggy backed on me while living here in my apartment. 

Also another thing, he doesn’t seem to understand that dirty dishes aren’t supposed to just be left out where you ate at. He lacks any motivation to clean up after himself and keep his clothes in his bedroom and not scattered all over my apartment. I’ve told him multiple times to clean up after himself but time and time again he doesn’t listen. Me personally, am very self conscious about having a clean place. So this alone is driving me insane.

c284p7	2019-06-18 21:27:01	Logical_Vast	AITA if I feed my neighborhood squirrels?	"There are a lot of  squirrels, in my neighborhood. I like feeding them and they know me.  The squirrels will sit in my yard waiting at a certain time each day.  They don't let me touch them and I would not do that but they don't really run away from me either they just wait. It's a simple joy in my life to watch them.  My grandma did the same thing and she taught me a lot about animals.  We were every close and I guess in a way doing this reminds me of her too. 

I am an animal lover and I don't see the harm in giving them a few nuts of a piece of fruit espeicly in winter.  I have heard my neighbor saying their garden is getting dug up and the squirrels are ""bold"".  This women is very into her plants. She has very pretty flowers.  I know they see them as pests and they are probably digging around their yards burying nuts and what not.  Same thing happened with my grandma. The block found out she was doing it and demanded she stop.  They don't know it's me yet. I have lived in this house for a few months and I did the same thing at my last place but no one had a garden it was an apartment. 

I could not care less about my lawn or who digs in it. I just trim the grass to look polite but I am not like Hank Hill or something.  So I am infringing on my neighbors to feed the wild life? I don't want someone to shoot them and I am afraid they will now.  I also feel sad when they stand by my window and I don't feed them. I know they should be wild. I have never given them enough food to live on just treats. They still need to find things on their own. They sell squirrel food on Amazon. I can't be the only guy who likes doing this."	Asshole	0	0

c283rg	2019-06-18 21:24:53	bakedbeans37	AITA for hating my husbands family	"First I’d like to add this whole relationship is a roller coaster. 

My husband and I are both 20. We had never officially dated but had a strong communication for about 3 years prior to me joining the military. About 10 months ago I joined so you know I had to leave for training and all that. During my time away we decided to make our relationship official. We wrote letters back and forth then when it came time for me to graduate he shows up to my graduation with my family. Everything turned out super well except neither of our families had ever been introduced to each other prior to that so everyone was freaked out about who this guy was. Also because I had never even brought his name up to them. That weekend we got engaged. Not for extra money or any other reason people get married in the military. We just felt like it was right. We’ve been seeing each other for about 2 years prior to us getting engaged. I finally met his family for the first time in my military dress attire and they proceed to tell me how they hate the military bla bla. It was pretty awkward for me but for the most part they came off as pretty nice at first. During our engagement I end up leaving for a couple of months to a different state for training. He tells his family our intentions of getting married once I return to visit in 2 weeks. They freak out. Next thing I know I’m standing in his living room surrounded by his family telling me if I get married I’m betraying all of them and I’ll always be the girl none of them want around. His mom basically shits on me while I stand there next to him. She tells me we better not get married or else. So I thought about it and said fuck it. I don’t put up with my OWN families bullshit I’m not gonna take hers. The thing is I don’t have a mother figure in my life so I’ve always been independent when it comes to choices and such. I really tried to come around to her but she’s so damn dramatic. We end up getting married and I get stationed in another state so obviously my husband is coming with me. I understand her being sad about him leaving but he’s a grown ass man going on with life. Even now his family refuses to talk to him and cut off his communication with his very young nieces. She still keeps in contact with him but every time she just makes it well known how angry/sad she is about it. She tells us we destroyed their family. Am I the asshole for thinking we made a good choice and wanting nothing to do with them? I just can’t stand their negativity. I know we rushed things and hey maybe later on it *might* be a mistake but that’s for US to deal with. And if it is it will be an experience WE go through. We live in a beautiful home and don’t struggle with bills so am I bad person for giving their son a new life to experience??

EDIT: I didn’t get into it but while his mom was shitting on me in front of his family he did tell them all about how much he loved me and he was sorry they felt this way but he was still going to leave with me and get married. I meant standing next to me as standing in support."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c283lp	2019-06-18 21:24:33		AITA for being sassy with a friend who invited me to her bachelorette party but not her wedding?	"I have a friend who is getting married soon. We’ve known each other since middle school, she was my first roommate in college, we lived in the same apartment complex after the dorms; all this to say that although we’ve never been best friends, we’ve always been close.

I have always supported her, always defended her, and always really liked her, to be honest. We get along great. 

She recently got engaged and I just blindly assumed that I would be invited. I got invited to the bridal shower/bachelorette party combo recently and realized that I’d not ever received a “save the date” or wedding invitation, even though the wedding was in 6 weeks. I kind of thought it was weird, and didn’t want to make anything awkward, so I just kind of put it to the side for a couple of days.

Before I could decide what to do, the bride sent me a text. I deleted it after anger but here’s the gist:

“Hey girly, I know this is awkward but I wanted to reach out and let you know why you haven’t received a wedding invitation yet. The thing is, [Fiancé] and I both have huge families and we are only inviting members of the wedding party to the wedding. I would really love it if you could make it to the bridal shower/bachelorette party though! We haven’t seen each other in forever.”

I was kind of shocked at the absolute gall. I admit I’m a very reactive person and couldn’t stop myself from being a little bitchy in return:

“[Friend], I have always cared deeply for you but this is not only the rudest message I’ve ever received, it’s also shockingly tacky. I won’t be able to attend the party, I’m sorry. Lol.”

The “lol” was especially bitchy but seriously I can’t wrap my head around the insanity of inviting someone to your bridal shower so you can get a gift out of them, but not wanting them at your wedding. 

The MOH (our other very close childhood friend) reached out to let me know that the bride was extremely hurt, and suggested I apologize. She acknowledged that the whole situation was awkward, but gave the typical “it’s her wedding, she’s under a lot of stress, she’s trying to do the right thing...”

I don’t care if she didn’t have room for me at the wedding, I think the text would have been sweet if it was just her saying “sorry we couldn’t fit everyone” and I would have completely understood. It’s the bridal shower invitation that feels like a slap in the face.

c2833h	2019-06-18 21:23:21	OscaraWilde	"AITA for using the bathroom while it's ""being cleaned""?"	"There's a custodian who works in my building who frequently takes the cleaning cart, leaves it outside of the bathroom as though it's currently being cleaned, but who will then just sit in one of the chairs in the bathroom and chill -- watch youtube on her phone, call her friends, listen to music, whatever. She'll do this for maybe 45 min-an hour at a time several times a day. I only discovered this when I went into the bathroom when the cart was outside because I had left something in there, and she looked up at me with this total deer in headlights look. The next time, I walked down the hallway twice in a half hour or so and noticed that the cart had been there the whole time (it's a small bathroom, so it doesn't usually take custodians that long to clean it, so I noticed), and since I had to pee I went in, and sure enough she was sitting there on her phone.

So now, instead of going to the (much) farther bathroom when I see the cart outside, I just go in and use this bathroom. 99% of the time she's just sitting there on her phone, not cleaning. I feel a little bad, because she always looks uncomfortable/annoyed, and because I generally do feel that there's a taboo against using a bathroom that's being actively cleaned (I don't want to make the custodian listen to me use the bathroom / something just feels weird about it??), and I guess I get why she wants some peace and quiet, but she does it so often and for so long that it would be really annoying for me to have to trek to the other bathroom on the other side of the building so many times a day, so I just do this.

I had an ex that was my first love and pretty much ruined my teenage years and early 20's. He cheated on me all the time and broke my heart over and over. I know that it is my fault for going back to him but what can I say but I was young and in love. He would keep trying to get back with me until I had to cut all ties and block his number and everything else.

So that being said, I thought that my family hated him for what he did to me, but I found out through my husband that my sister has been liking everything that my ex and his girlfriend post. (The girl he cheated on me with among a few others.) I actually went through my social media and my sister has not liked anything of mine. I know it seems stupid, but it broke my heart more that my sister, whom I thought was close, is supporting this person who tore me apart more than me. 

I talked to my husband about it, but he just says that my sister is part of the cycle of a small town, which we have escaped. I know that with a small town that it is hard to avoid people, but I feel like this guy stole my youth. How can she possibly support these people, but not me?!

c281rp	2019-06-18 21:20:14	throwawaynoonecansee	AITA for assuming my GF knew booking an organized tour with a friend meant sharing accommodations?	"TL;DR: Went on a trip with a friend. Didn't explicitly say I was sharing a room and now my GF thinks it's at a deceit level equivalent to me not being trustworthy. She's ready to end the relationship over this.

&#x200B;

My female friend, whom I met on a trip last year on one of those adventure tours groups, asked if I wanted to go on a trip since we seemed to travel well. I talked to my GF and she was supportive. Before I left, I set up a shared cloud folder of all of my travel arrangements with my GF and I asked her to print off the stuff. 

&#x200B;

At the first hotel and I video call my GF. She seemed off in the call and commented on the single bed. I was confused. I showed her the hotel has two twin beds close together. We were texting as usual. At the next hotel, I called her again. My friend came into the shot, the mood changed and the call ended. We talked again later and she seemed ok so I figured, whatever was wrong might be about something going on at home. For the rest of the trip, I continued to call/message and all I received were curt responses. I took it as a hint that maybe she's forcing me not to talk and to go enjoy my trip (she's told me to do so before). Returning home, my GF is distant. I tell her about my trip, showed her all my photos and videos. Talked about my new friends and the hookups they got into. She then tells me she didn't know I was sharing rooms with my friend. I'm deadpan confused and she tells me not to play this surprised card on her. WTF. The trip took months to plan and I reminded her of the calls to the tour group, organizing and getting on the same flights, tour dates and accommodations. She said booking doesn't mean sharing a room.  I reminded about the docs but she said she didn't want to access them because it seemed like a private. She said it seemed that I was intentionally not telling her, that I was deceitful because I should have known her jealous tendencies would need me to spell it out for her. From her perspective, it led her to think I might be hiding more. 

&#x200B;

After I went to bed separately, she sent me a text to say she thought she was enough. She forwards me one of the pics I sent her while on the trip of me and my friend out at a club and she said it was uncalled for and mean. I repeated that it didn't register to me what she was upset over at the time. I said she should have told me then but I apologized for not digging further. I'm at a loss. This morning she left me a note saying she thought she wasn't enough for me and that she was right. I want to talk to her when she gets home. I'm not sure I'm going to get far when she's this angry."

c27xjb	2019-06-18 21:10:27	throwaway930629	AITA for my comments regarding an episode of American Dad?	"So my girlfriend and I (26m/24f) are pretty avid fans of this show. We've seen the series a few times over. Lately, we put the show on as background noise. 

Last night, my gf's friend Kate came over (23f if it matters, ). She likes the show too but rarely watches it; she's more of a ""I'll watch it if it's on"" person. We were all just talking and we had an episode on in the background. She didn't mind that it was on.

We were watching a particular episode where Francine (the wife) disguises herself as a man so she can be with Stan (the husband) while he hangs out with his work buddies. Events happen, which leads to Stan beating the shit out of Francine (**still disguised as a man)** because he thinks the man killed her. 

That was pretty much the end of the episode, and after the credits rolled, Kate made a disgusted noise and asked me to turn it off before the next one came on. I complied, but asked why. She said that it was ""disgusting that this show glorifies and makes fun of spousal abuse"".  
I retorted that Stan only beat Francine because he didn't know it was her, and in fact thought she was dead. I said that it kinda showed how much he loves her, because (in his mind) he was beating his wife's killer. She then retorted that I was an asshole for laughing at it, because I was ""trivializing millions of women who go through this shit"".

In all fairness, there's a scene just after in which Jon Hamm shows up and says to the viewer that you shouldn't get involved in domestic violence and just leave it be, and that all DV was 'just two people working stuff out'. I don't particularly like that scene, at face value it's entirely the wrong message ( I know it's probably a reference I don't understand.)   
I told Kate this, and that I agree that sometimes this show (and Family Guy) can go too far, but this wasn't one of those times. Kate then said I was ""picking and choosing"" parts of each argument. She said that whenever she is watching an episode, she'll turn it off if it touches on subjects like this.

My final rebuttal was that it's just a fucking show, and to enjoy it doesn't reflect on the values of the person. She then said she was done with the conversation.

My gf was on my side during this. Kate didn't really have a go at her for this, probably because they've been friends for millennia. The evening then went on as normal, though a little tense. After she left, my girlfriend explained that she gets heated on topics like this and can get carried away.

c27xc4	2019-06-18 21:09:57	ToxicSteve13	AITA for refusing my stepmother's demand to take down a Facebook post?	"I'll try to keep this short. 

For Father's day, I posted a picture of me and my father for Father's Day, like a lot of people do. He passed away over 5 years ago so I had put in a ""RIP"" at the end of my post. 

My stepmother for years has requested I remove the ""RIP"" from my posts about him because of one reason.... She hasn't told anyone in her family that he's passed away. 

She has explained to her family that he's on a business trip whenever they ask to talk to him or see him on Skype. She also occasionally posts pictures of them seemingly like they were just taken to keep this lie afloat. 

Her reasoning for not telling them is two fold, one is that she's simply not ready to tell them, two is because in her culture supposedly widows have failed their husbands. You see, she is the only one of her family that is in America and she got over here on a marriage visa. So it's not a culture I am 100% used to. 

Also I guess they never told her family that he had cancer since before they were married so any of those posts she wants removed as well.

So when she demanded this time around saying that I just don't understand because I am too young and have never been married... I kinda lost it finally and said I am not ever going to delete my posts about my father and I don't care if her family finds out, they deserve to know.  It's been longer since he's passed than how long they knew each other including the marriage. I really laid into it. 

Now she's crying and called me a bad son.

c27wt1	2019-06-18 21:08:39	textinfernoto1800	AITA for going to dinner with my friend instead of my girlfriend?	" 

Pretty simple argument here but I am a little torn.

Basically, I was unsure yesterday if I would have time tonight to be out with anyone. My girlfriend and I were talking (while we were out) about whether or not we would be able to spend time together today, and we decided we would see what we had scheduled tomorrow. I had a job interview and had to work out today, but I was likely going to be free in the evening.

Come to this morning, and another friend of mine asks me if I wanted to go to dinner. I have time tonight, so I said yes. I figured since my girlfriend and I didn't have definitive plans and since we had been together for several hours yesterday I would dedicate some time to other relationships.

My girlfriend later asks if we could do dinner and I told her that I was going out with a friend and she got upset. The way she explained it was she didn't mind that I was hanging out with other people, but she wishes I would've told her I had time free when I found out, before my other friend had a chance to ask me.

I am a little torn, because I can understand that she would want me to update her given that we talked about our schedules yesterday, but also I don't want to have to keep her up to date on what I'm doing 24/7, and I don't want to have to justify it every minute I'm not spending time with her.

c27w8w	2019-06-18 21:07:26		AITA for telling my mom to use reusable bags?	"So this turned into a pretty big fight quick. 

My mom went into Safeway only getting hamburger buns and a tiny ass bottle of almond milk. 

When she came back to the car I asked why she needed a plastic bag when it was just buns and almond milk. 

She asked politely: why wouldn’t I get a bag

I said: because it’s ruining the environment and you really don’t need one. 

She turned around and stepped on the gas pedal to back out. 

“Ok then I guess one plastic bag is ruining the environment.” 

A few minutes of silence went by and she started yelling that it’s not her fault and it’s the new generations fault. 

All I did was asked her if she needed a bag and that she should try reusable bags.

c27tat	2019-06-18 21:00:56	EmergencyPossession6	AITA for becoming uncomfortable around lesbians after having the love of my life come out at me?	"***Long story short:***

I  was in a wonderful relationship with this girl. We both came from a  pretty bad place with bad experiencees, and we immediatelly clicked. Our  sense of humour, passions for stuff etc.

&#x200B;

Even  without idealizing it you wouldn't be able to find a more amazing  person. She was there for me at our worst and so was I for her. We were also each other's firsts which.... yeah. I never was big on strong  commitments  (given my super pessimistic outlook on everything) but I  could see  myself spending the rest of my days with her.

&#x200B;

After  2 years together, which were quite honestly the best in my life and   helped me and her grow not only as a person (and move forward in life   with actual motivation), she came out as a lesbian and broke up with me.

&#x200B;

Now,   I've always been a supporter of LGBTQ. I didn't hate her for it, but I  do admit I was absolutely devastated (as was she) and felt absolutely  worthless and fell into deep depression (I am much better now tho). But I still tried to support her in this endeavour and never once faulted or  guilt tripped her over this. I wanted her to be happy, even if it was  maybe without me. And we still cared about each other as a person.

&#x200B;

***The asshole part:***

The thing is, ever since the breakup I feel..... increasingly uncomfortable around lesbians. Not gay men, but just lesbians.

I  don't even hate them or wish ill upon them or anything, but my   discomfort kinda grows around them, be it in real life or fictional ones in TV.

&#x200B;

There  was this french movie which I guess some of you may know (Blue is the   Warmest Colour) which has some... explicit scenes and is probably   enjoyable for a lot of guys and gals. But as silly as that may sound, I  can't even stand seeing the pictures from it because it makes me feel   very uneasy (both the nature of deep romance between two women or them   having a passionate love making session). Same for Chasing Amy or other  movies with the same thematic.

&#x200B;

Outside  when I see a lesbian couple (who may be affectionate towards each  other), I kinda have to avert my eyes and quicken my pace or move away.   Otherwise I get all uncomfortable and start feeling very awkward.

&#x200B;

Even my best childhood friend (who is a lesbian metalhead) has been   wondering where I've been these past few months, but now I am for some   reason avoiding her as much as possible. I don't even do it on purpose,  but subconsiously, I keep isolating myself from her too.

&#x200B;

So  what is this? I am the asshole and maybe acting unreasonable for suddenly becoming uncomfortable around lesbian women after one broke my heart?

Maybe I am projecting some kind of breakup trauma at all of them or becoming subconsciously homophobic? Which would make me double the asshole I guess, and I'd really hate that..."	Not enough info	0	0

c27saw	2019-06-18 20:58:32	crawlinghumans	WIBTA if I refuse to go to my brother's fiancee's party?	"Hello! This is my first Reddit post. My brother(25) is getting married in a few months. His fiancee, who is nice, invited me to be a bridesmaid. This was 100% out of feeling obligated to because I am her fiance's sister, not because we are friends. We have had very limited conversation, so I appreciate the gesture.

So I was invited to the bachelorette party, which they are planning to have in Canada (we live in America, at a distance where you need a plane ride to get to Canada) for FOUR days straight to do a wine tour. They picked a random weekend plus thursday and friday for this, to which I immediately said I can't go because I am starting grad school three weeks prior. Since I am in an accelerated grad program, I go to class twice a week (thursday and friday) from 9am-4:30pm straight. And you can not miss class for this program, they were very clear about that.

So they then asked me if I can go straight to the airport after class friday and hop on a plane and go to canada for friday night, saturday, and part of sunday and then fly home. Plus I need to pay for all my housing and plane tickets and food. Considering I just graduated from college a week ago, have no job, and am going further in debt to get my Masters, I said I don't have the money (which is true, I have less than my rent money that is due in two weeks).

My brother replied by telling me to ask mom and dad and that is will only be like $300 (which I sincerely doubt it will be that cheap). Plus my brother and I grew up together, so he should know they are not going to do that happily. Plus they already gave him $10k for the wedding.

Just to add the cherry on top, my brother definitely was the asshole to me last week and I haven't completely forgiven him, which is making me want to go to this canada thing less. (long story short, he ""couldn't"" make it to my graduation, yet he was able to go to his fiancee's sister graduation a few states over) I know an eye for an eye makes the world blind, but I am seriously upset about that still so its affecting my decision a lot, too.

But I got a text from my brother saying that his fiancee was really upset that lots of people blew her off and to look out for an updated date for the trip that will work for everyone. He told me it means a lot to her that I come and should really try my best to come. He said he would talk to our parents about having them pay for the trip. So I don't know what to do. I don't want to go on this trip much anymore, especially since I am not close with his fiancee and know none of her friends, and don't have the funds. Would I be the asshole for blowing it off and not being appreciative of her invitation into the wedding party? And if I say I still can't go after they change the dates, will that make me a bigger jerk for still not going?

EDIT: Just some extra info, my family is not close at all and I've never been to a wedding so I am not sure what is normal

EDIT 2: I also remembered that I am currently looking for a job, so I don't know when I will be working and if I will have work during the trip"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c27s5n	2019-06-18 20:58:12	SaltCantaloupe	AITA for confronting my reclusive Neighbor?	"Honestly, i hate my neighbor. He is a nuisance. He never leaves the house, he's very fat and slovenly, looks like he hasn't groomed in years, and he is a nuisance to the entire neighborhood, he blares this awful classical music 24 hours a day, we all hate it. And he's mean to my kids. Always complains about them.  We've tried to befriend him, my kids tried selling coupons to him, invited him to dinner, and tried to be good neighbors multiple times. But he always slams the door in our face. Never a ""No, THanks"". Just slamming the door.

I've written about him before: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bwwowt/41f_am_i_wrong_for_confronting_my_reclusive/

If a ball gets knocked over in his yard, he always yells at her and threatens to call the cops when they try to retrieve it. My daughter is so scared that she'll go to jail. 

Also, he has a dog. My daughter is special needs and loves animals. So, she always goes to pet it and she's not hurting anyone. But he always shouts at her and threatens to call the cops. He always complains, but she's hurting no one. one day, i heard him screaming at her and she was crying for me at the top of her lungs. I almost got into an argument with him because of a rude remark he made about my kids.

And last week, she came home crying and soaking wet. He attacked her with a hose. Completely ruined her $200 dress when she fell in the mud.

I am totally sick of this guy and his constant whining.

Another incident, this guy got all hysterical. He ordered a package online for the umpteenth time this month, but the mailman told me to hold onto it, because he was gone. Behind my back, my kids opened it and got some items out of it. I quickly took them back and resealed the box. He came to our door and just took the box, he was furious. Nothing was broken, but he just started shouting and even threatened to sue us. He couldn't even thank us.

The worst incident however, was a few days ago. We got into a huge argument. My kids were playing in the sidewalk, riding their bikes. Not on his property but right on the line, but he just kept scowling at them, out his window. Then they stood on the sidewalk, before his driveway. They were staring back at him. He just kept watching them. My son (7) stepped one foot on his driveway and he stormed back inside. He called the cops on me. They told me about trespassing and everything.

When they left, i stormed over to his house and started yelling at him, for calling the cops. I told him i should sue for my daughter's dress. He slammed the door on me and blared that God-Awful crap again. I kept banging on his door. I called him a crybaby and a p*ssy for hiding. (I know, rude,but you don't just mess with my kids.)

I think he's just a dick who hates kids.

But, am i wrong here? I mean, i have to defend my kids, right?"	Asshole	0	0

c27ogp	2019-06-18 20:49:58	mountainthrowaway123	AITA for splitting into groups on a hike?	"I recently went on a hike/climb with my SO in a group of 13 people. The mountain we were climbing is 1000m of elevation and about 5km each way. It's raining, windy and very cold. 

As we began the hike, it became clear that there were hugely different fitness levels in the group. We were only about 100m in when people at the back asked to stop, they were puffing.

Now I'm a moderately fit person. Everytime we stopped, I would stand in the cold, rain and wind for 15+ minutes at a time. I wasn't exerting myself enough to stay warm. I admit I was feeling frustrated but I didn't complain.

About 2 hours in, we were less than 2km in. There were two women at the back in particular who were really struggling. One guy asks one of these women whether she thinks she can make it up safely and she gets really pissed at him and says she doesn't fucking know. 

The guy comes back up to the front with me, and there's a group of about six of us. So I said let's just go and split into two or three groups. I called down to the other group and said we were going to start moving and we should split into groups; I didn't get any reply back, but I took it as there were no objections so I started walking and leading the group alongside my SO and another guy. 

Myself, my SO, and this other guy summited at the 3 hour mark. Most people came up in the next 30 minutes but here's no sign of the final two people. 

Another 15 minutes and the final two join us. The final two who came up want to take at least a 45 minute break. I complain privately to my SO, explaining that I'm freezing and I've been up at this summit for over an hour and want to go down now.

My SO agrees with me and says that a few others have been discussing it anyway. So about 5 of us start making our way down the mountain. The people who didn't come with us don't say anything but I can see they looked a bit miserable. 

My SO and I got to the pub at the bottom at 4pm. People starting coming down over the next 2 hours. By 6.30pm, I'm ready to leave but we're still waiting for the final two people. Someone suggests we order food then but another guy says it wouldn't be polite to order food before everyone had made it down. My SO said that we weren't going to wait any longer, we got down over 2 hrs ago and that we were leaving now. 

The thing is, I feel like an asshole because I really didn't care about keeping the group together. I know that's the nice thing to do but it just felt so impractical in this situation. For the sake of keeping the group together, we were making everyone miserable. I spoke to my SO about it and he agrees, but I worry that because the two of us were at the front consistently that we might be percieved as assholes.

And when I relay this story to my own friends, I've heard mixed things. Some people are on my side and said they would have done the same thing. Others say I'm an asshole for not being a team player. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c27nrw	2019-06-18 20:48:29	Arqium	AITA for calling out my sister in law for talking about his husband?	"We were having a sunday lunch with family when my sister in law, married less than 1 year, started to talk about his husband not in a nice way, but with a joking tone.

It was not the first time, she start to say ""MY husband is so forgetful"".  
""i have to do everything for my husband""

""the problem of my husband is that he is xxx, or yyyy""

It was with a joking tone in a light mood, but i got offended by it and just called her and spoke firmly: ""stop saying things about him, i want to get to know him like the way he is, not the way you talk about"".

My wife got angry, and even now 3 months later she kept bringing this back as a some sort of flaw in my character.

&#x200B;

For why i got offended?  
In my childhood my mother married 2 men (in different times, of course) and she and other women often talk shit about them in front of me, ofter not in a light maner.

I grew up to hating them because i believed in my mother... but at same time, i started to hate the things in me that i saw in them. I am 35y and just recently started to free myself from such negativity, i am in therapy. It caused me to have shame of my masculinity, my sexuality and my desires and necessities. I neglected myself so much, that after 30 years there is almost nothing left, and just now i started to stand against the apathy that stood over me.

&#x200B;

Well, my wife is right, iIprojected such feelings in it, but at same time i don't think myself wrong to try to stop such toxic behavior (that i think it is), that even in such light mood it hurts me, and maybe it could be hurting him (bit by bit).

My wife says that i don't know, and she keeps saying that he wasn't feeling anything about, and it is all just in my mind."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We been dating for a few months now ( we were talking for a while ) & I like her a lot might even love her she’s great ! she treats me very well & makes me happy  but she has a kid!. 

Now listen I know what you all are gonna say “ well you put yourself into this & you knew she had a kid  “ I know I know ! but the way I felt about her clouded my judgement at the time. Keep in mind I have gender dysphoria that she does not know about nor will I tell her about , simply for my own personal reasons so that fact that she has a kid really fucking bothers me. I type envy men for being everything I want ( a man ) & the fact that she had a kid with some fucking dickhead that I don’t even know but I hate him . He kind of sucks at being a dad & to me it’s like why !? I fucking WISH I had this with her or anyone but I can’t give anyone a kid . I think I don’t like the kid because he’s his fucking kid & I feel like I’m providing for this fuckers kid they look exactly alike  & just the fact that he fucked her & all had a whole relationship just bothers me so much you have no idea. I wouldn’t be like this if it was a girl ex & if she didn’t have a kid. 

 I don’t date bi girls for this reason, she now says she’s just gay but I don’t believe it at all not that’s she’s given me a reason to think that I just don’t idk & I do NOT like that because it’s like taking a shot at my manhood if that makes sense it’s weird , but I low key don’t like her for all this because she had an abortion at 19 with someone else ig & that’s the only reason why she had her kid now. Listen to me it’s like she fucking ruined her life she can’t go to school or really better herself because she made this decision & she has no time to do anything mind you she fucking hates her baby daddy LIKE WHYD YOU HAVE A FUCKING KID WITH HIM THEN like she didn’t even care that she was having a kid the way she explained it to me ... were you even fucking thinking about your future you’re an idiot ! .. I hate myself for saying all of this because I feel like I’m being very selfish & I honestly think I’m a dickhead for saying all of this but it’s just how I feel, this gender shit really fucks with my head & makes my everyday life very hard . I put up w feeling like this because it’s honestly a everyday thing weather I’m w her or not this is all very complicated I didn’t go into much detail cause it’s a lot but hopefully I don’t sound like stupid piece of shit ..

I do most of the housework.  I do 100% of yard/shoveling, vacuuming, laundry, changing sheets, dusting, sweeping, mopping.  It will depend on the day or week but I'll say an even split on dishes and preparing or getting meals.

We also have a dog, and I do about 90% of the care for her.  Walking her and taking her out almost every time, taking her to appointments, feeding and watering her.

I work a job where I get up at 6am and get home at 6pm 5 days a week.  My spouse gets up around 8am and gets home at 5pm.

I am generally okay with this set up because my spouse does have allergies and depression, so sometimes they will do a lot of things at once, sometimes nothing to help for days.

The problem I run into is this.  We love each other, and my spouse wants to spend every waking moment with me.  They are not controlling, but just want to be with me and doing things with me every moment we aren't at work.

I love my spouse, and want to spend time with them too, but not 100% of my free time.  We can spend 100% of a whole weekend together and when the next day after work comes around, if I want to golf, or just watch a TV show or game by myself, it will deeply upset them.

Things finally came to a head when a very important sports game came on that was giving me anxiety.  It was something I was very excited for and my spouse came and sat with me.  Being nervous I asked them if it was okay if I watched it alone.  That is how I phrased it.  This sparked an incredible rage.

AITA?

Edit: A couple things I want to make clear.

I did not identify genders in my case for either my spouse or I.

Rage consisted of verbal, nothing physical in the least.

c27jdn	2019-06-18 20:38:44		WIBTA if I cancelled a welcome party after I already invited everyone?	"I'm going to keep this generally vague just in case. 

I am apart of a performing arts group, and I'm in charge of marketing, business-y stuff, and social events. Honestly, all of it has become exhausting so I've been delagating a lot. I just got a new job, I am going back to school in the Fall, and my life is a mess right now. I've dropped the ball here and there lately because I am so stressed.

Anyway, we  just accepted 10 new members last week, which is almost as many people in our current cast. It was brought up that we need to make new people feel more welcome, so I decided to plan a simple welcome party. I asked another member to host it at their house, and I was going to bring the food. All I had to do was go shopping and cook. Easy. They live on a lake, have a hot tub, and a huge house. Everyone was invited. Done. 

Well  yesterday (Monday), the person hosting the party dropped out. Some work thing ""suddenly"" came up. They mentioned on the phone that they'd known about this work thing for awhile, but forgot about it. The party is this Friday. Despite having a million other things going on, I dropped everything to try and find somewhere else to have it. Basically, I have found two options. Another member has offered to host it, but everyone would have to leave and everything would have to be cleaned up by 10 pm (the party starts at 6:30 or 7-ish). There is another location, but it is a 45 minute drive for pretty much everyone. On top of all this, I would have to find new ways to entertain people.

I want to cancel. Oh my god, I want to cancel. I wanted a simple party, and this got complicated fast. But other higher ups in the group have been saying it'd be a major asshole move to not have a party after saying 'Welcome to our group! We're having a party for you new people!""

c27iog	2019-06-18 20:37:13		WIBTA for telling a girl I don't know that her boyfriend cheated on her	"Throwaway because some of my friends know my account.

So I have been working at this retail store for a while where mostly teens (18-22) are hired. I had been talking to this girl, lets call her G, there for a few weeks and was planning on asking her out. I eventually did and she agreed to hang on a day where she didn't have to come in the day after. Well during that timespan we had some new hires, since it was summer of course. 

The way the schedule was made, the new hires would start work the day me and this girl were supposed to hang out. When the new employees came in, I recognized one, lets call him B. I have his girlfriend on snapchat (I have never seen her in person, but she lives in my city), and that is where I recognized the guy from since she posts him sometimes. They had to be trained, and B wound up getting trained by G since the other shift manager was real busy and G had been working there for a while now. 

So my shift goes by normally and I confirmed with G if we were still on for later, which she confirmed. I had agreed to pick her up in the afternoon since her car wasn't working. She told me she would be ready and let me know at 8:00 to go pick her up. Well half and hour had passed and I messaged her to see if everything was ok. She just told me that something important had came up and that she wouldn't be able to hang out, and that she was so sorry blah blah. I was disappointed and just settled in since I had work the next day. 

I showed up to work yesterday, and B was there too with only a couple hours left on his shift. I had to sweep the back of the store, and B was there talking to what I suppose was his friend. His friend didn't work there, but it didn't matter since the manager very rarely went to the back. I was hidden behind some crates so they didn't know I was there. Thats when I overheard B talking about how it was only his second day and that he hooked up with G. He explained to his friend how they had to do it in her car after she drove to his place since his parents were home. He had begin talking about how ""tight"" she was when I came across the crates still sweeping. They just said hey and kept talking for a while until B told his friend he had to get back to work.

I am debating telling his girlfriend through snapchat that her boyfriend cheated on her. However it would pretty much be my word against his, and she probably won't believe me since we don't even know each other. That is why I haven't told her yet, but WIBTA if I did go ahead and let her know?"		1	0
c27iaq	2019-06-18 20:36:18	RunRunRhonda	AITA for asking someone to delete a social media photo that I am in?	"I feel like I am justified in the below but I've had mixed opinions from friends.

I'll preface this all with three things:  
1.) I am not on social media AT ALL (unless you would count Reddit).  
2.) I had only ever met ONE of the other girls attending the event once.  
3.) I have no issue with women displaying their body as they feel is comfortable for them.

I was on a bachelorette weekend this past weekend, celebrating my soon-to-be sister-in-law (Samantha\*).  The girls there were all around 27-28 and I am 35.  We had a really nice weekend; hanging by the pool, eating, a bit of wine tasting, etc.  Of course we took some photos.  A couple of the girls asked for my IG handle and I told them all I was not on social media.  

When I returned home, my husband told me that he saw a picture Samantha was tagged in on Facebook, and it was essentially a full-body shot of me in a bikini, with some other girls in the background of the photo.  I am pretty comfortable with my body, but honestly I don't love ANY photos of myself being posted online without my permission.  Unless the photo contains my child as well, I never raise a fuss.  But, I dunno, this made me feel a little violated.  

So I texted the girl who posted about it, and she says, ""Oh but you look good in that picture.""  That is not the issue at all here, so I said, ""Thank you, but I don't love my image being all over the internet for strangers to see.""  She then goes on this rant about body positivity and how I shouldn't let society dictate what should be an appropriate picture of a woman's body, etc. etc.  I didn't even know how to reply, so I didn't. 

I figured my initial ask to remove the picture would be enough, but my husband checked and it is still there.  WIBTA if I pushed her and told her to remove the photo again?  The wedding is in 10 days so I don't want to cause a scene before then, but I feel I am in the right here."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c27hbc	2019-06-18 20:34:14	Triple_Fudge_Browine	AITA for being upset that my parents are only planning on having dinner with me?	"I know this may sound like a spoiled kid, but please hear me out. Before we get to the main part some relevant information is that I am the youngest of 5 children. One of my siblings is currently not on great terms with my parents and another lives across the country. The other two and myself all live within two neighboring states, one sibling in one state (about 8 hours from me) and one in the same state (about 4 hours away) and I live in a major city basically in-between them. My sibling who lives out of state is also currently watching two of my other siblings kids due to a housing issue. 


Okay, on to the main point of this. On Sunday when I called my Dad to wish him a happy Father's Day my mom basically railroaded the entire conversation to tell me the drama surrounding her and my sibling that she's fighting with. Culminating in the fact that they moved up their vacation several weeks and were currently right outside my sibling who lives out of states town to pick up one of their kids, as well as the two kids of my other sibling. She went on to tell me that they were spending the day with my sibling and would then be going to see my other sibling in my state (yesterday) since it was their day off and then they would maybe come up the following day and see me and my family as they left town back to their home state.


My biggest issue is that yesterday was also my only day off. And instead of talking to me before their trip so I could try to spend time with them, they only even brought it up to me because I happened to call. Am I wrong to feel like an afterthought? They spent all of yesterday and most of today with my sibling and I will only see them in passing after having worked all day.


I don't know of it's a factor or not but I have one child (who happens to have a disability) and both my other siblings each have 2+ kids. It makes it seem like they don't want to spend time with me because I haven't been a good enough incubator for them. I'm honestly feeling really guilty about thinking this, so Reddit am I the Asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c27gw7	2019-06-18 20:33:21	Cool_Kid_Chris	AITA For Not Attending My Mom’s “Celebration of Life”?	"My mom died on Thursday morning. I was there by her side when she took her last breath. Later that afternoon, my brother and 2 sisters went to make cremation arrangements. I could tell my family wasn’t going to help so I maxed out a credit card and then paid $890 out of my bank account which only had $1,200 in it to begin with and was my money to get by for the next 2 weeks and to pay bills but I didn’t want my mom to sit in a refrigerator at the funeral home and incur a higher bill for storing her body.
Later that night me, my brother, and my sisters were planning a celebration of life for my mother and were thinking of days to have it. I named 1 day I couldn’t do it, the next Thursday, because my wife worked that night and we desperately need the money plus she’s saving up all vacation so she can take 5 weeks off after surgery she’s going to have in August. Since my wife earns the money that paid for my mom’s cremation, I assumed my siblings might take this in consideration. My brother kept on recommending Thursday because his daughter has softball tournaments all the time and this is the one day he knows she doesn’t have one. My sister kept on insisting the celebration had to be soon or it wo uld become old news and people wouldn’t be interested in coming. I later found out it’s because she has vacation the following week. I also found out my sister has several credit cards with no balances she could have helped pay for the cremation. I got tired of the whole incident and the ugliness of the whole thing.i sent a bunch of days my wife doesn’t work and stopped reading texts from them.
The next day I noticed that the day they chose was on a day my wife worked but noticed it didn’t conflict with softball games or vacation. I sent a text saying I won’t be going. When my nephew asked why, I said I didn’t have the gas money, btw, I live 120 miles from the rest of my family. Really, it’s about how my wife was so sweet when I told her I maxed out the credit card and took most of the money out our account to pay for this. She understood why I did it. I will not disrespect my wife, even though she told me to go without her, by attending this without her. She works 60 hours a week as an ER nurse to take care of me and our sons and paid lots of money for the cremation. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c27gnf	2019-06-18 20:32:49	ellistarr	WIBTA if I (25f) wants to take down my coworker's family portraits on her house I'm renting?	"My co-worker (CW) owns a duplex type of house. She lives on one side of the house and her mom on the other. When her mom went to the nursing home and decided that she’s staying there for good, no one lived on her side of the house anymore. CW has been kinda iffy and reluctant on putting it up for rent to strangers because she’s worried about her and the house’s safety. She also is still hesitant to make changes on the house (selling/moving furniture) while CW mom is still alive as she feels like it’s disrespectful to her.

Anyway, I have been thinking about moving out of my parents’ house for a long time. My car has recently been totaled/written off and I would get good money for it. I decided it is finally time to move out. Since CW has known me for a long time, she offered me her mom’s side of the house for a really cheap price. I would just be paying for the utilities, so basically rent-free. It’s a whole house to myself, own living room, kitchen and bathroom, extra bedroom, the whole spiel. It’s also furnished so I don’t have to buy anything like couch, tv, fridge  etc.  I could also car pool with her which would mean I would save lots of money because I don’t have to get a new car for now. It’s a really great deal and a great start to my living-alone situation.

Fast forward to today, I’m all moved in. The house is all clean and ready for me. It is great. But I noticed she left their family pictures up in the living room (her mom put them up). It's a picture of their whole family and individual pictures of all the kids/grandkids, about 10 pictures in total. I didn’t want to say anything because she has been great through all of these. I decided that it’s okay. It’s just pictures. But I’ve spent enough days on this house to know that I’m actually not comfortable with the picture hanging up. This side of the house is a little older and needs some work down, maintenance things (paint, faucet,shower head,kitchen cabinets update) so she’ll be coming over frequently. She will see if the pictures are up or not.

(She also left a huge rosary up on the bedroom wall but i took that down already.)

Will it be disrespectful to her mom and to CW?

TL;DR: CW gave me a great deal on her house for rent but i want to take their family pictures down."	Asshole	0	0

c27g14	2019-06-18 20:31:39	aaikins19	AITA for thinking of cancelling after rescheduling a hair appointment I can't afford?	"I like my current *natural hair* stylist, but in my opinion she charges a bit to much for my hair. I've only ever gotten protective styles from her and she used to charge me $145 but amped it up to $165 for braids, also including the fact that she had told me and my mom that since we didn't have that much money for her appointments *after we asked* she previously went down on prices but amped them up again regardless of what my mom and I's situation was. So after setting up an appointment with her a week ago for a box braid bob which was $165, I had to reschedule because 1. I had just gotten a job interview but it was on the day of the appointment, and 2. I had to take money of out my hair appointment money to help my mom with groceries 
. So then my mom tells me that there's a lady that I could contact to see if she can do my hair for a better price as my mom saw her work and liked it. So I contacted her and she said that she could get me in after she comes back in town. But I've already rescheduled with the other hair stylist and to cancel not only because I can't afford It but because I found another stylist who would give me a better price would be a jerk move to me.

c27dxw	2019-06-18 20:26:59	w3iss	WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my good friend one-on-one?	"So I'm really good friends with this guy, let's call him, Jim. He's dating a lovely girl named Pam for the past few months.

Now Jim and I would often grab drinks after work and talk about life and other things as friends do. But ever since his relationship with Pam has gotten serious, I'll ask him for drinks but then he will always invite his girlfriend over, which OK. Sure, it happens as friends get into relationships.
But what annoys me is that they get too into each other and then start ignoring me, which I think is very rude.

The only time we get to hang out on our own is when they're fighting but I can't guess when that could be when making plans for drinks. It's better to have someone else to talk to when that happens.

Like the other day, I was hanging out with them and another couple. At one point they started getting all lovey and handsy and the other couple and I awkwardly ignored them while having a conversation of our own. At least then I wasn't left to awkwardly stare at my phone waiting for them to take a break so I could make excuses to leave.

c27dbi	2019-06-18 20:25:39	GeoBunny1945	AITA? My sister-in-law is NOT living with us.	"Both my fiancé and I both really dislike his sister. Let me explain why.

I’m 22(f) and my fiancé 20(M) is living in a rented house with his sister(19) and she is horrible to him. She has FIVE ANIMALS that live in the house with her and she RARELY takes care of them, forcing my fiancé and I to take care of them. She always leaves multiple days at a time forcing Fiancé to stay at home and not be able to come see me during the week (I live with my mom right now). This causes us to fight. 
Every time we try to talk to her she goes crying to her mother (who lives in another city) who then has to come down and fix things. Because this is such a strain on Mom, we try not to say anything. Because of this Sister in law walks all over us. There are A LOT of other instances that have happened but to save time (I’m on mobile) 
We will just keep it to that.

Anyway, we were all thinking of moving out so his mom said she would help with a small sum of the rent wherever we go and I love her for that. My fiancé knows how much I dislike his sister but wanted her to move in with us so that the financial strain would be lighter on us. I told him no. No way in a million years. I told him we have four friends that can move in but not her. 
Am I the asshole?

c27c01	2019-06-18 20:22:57	Homesteader123	AITA: My wife has asked me to stop drinking. I said no.	"So I live in a rural area. I have my own homestead farm that I share with my wife. We have a few acres of land, grow most of our own food, and are not hurting for money.

&#x200B;

My wife and I split our chores for the homestead evenly I like to think. I tend to the goats, pigs, chickens, and ducks. The garden, the field, and the harvest mostly by myself. If we need more hands I hire them. I do all the repairs around the house that I built for us, the electic, the plumbing, the furnace, drilled a few wells, and so on.

&#x200B;

My wife has taken over more domestic duties. She prefers to work more inside the house. She tends to the laundry. She cooks our meals (which are wonderful), she dusts, sweeps, makes all the beds and folds all the clothes. She preserves what's preservable from the garden, cleans the slaughters, makes soap for us and to sell. She is very hard working.

&#x200B;

Recently after supper we were sitting in the living room when she asked me that she would like me to stop drinking. I am not a heavy drinker. I have a glass of whisky before dinner and another one before bed. This is how my father drank. This is how his father drank. I have never been a drunk, nor do I have any intention of being a drunk.

&#x200B;

I asked her for a reason and she said that she was worried for my health. My family is very long lived. All of the men on our side have lived to 90 and more. I topld her this and mentioned that I am not a drunk.

&#x200B;

I like to have a drink at the end of a long day. I am in perfect health for my age. I don't smoke. I just want to have a drink when I'm done with my chores.

Am I the a--hole?

"We live in a house of five, however one housemate lets his girlfriend stay over up to 5 nights a week including when he goes to work and the rest of us leave for work. We've already discussed this with him three times including once as a house meeting because it was getting out of hand. He agreed to the terms that we let her stay 5 nights a fortnight (which we thought was generous) and that she shouldn't be in the house on her own for more than an hour or two and if she is staying alone he needs to let us know she is there. Seems pretty reasonable, right? After the last chat all was good, the rules were obeyed for about a month. Now however she's back to staying for hours in the house unattended and he's informed us she now knows the alarm code to the house as well in case any of us put the alarm on when she's in because he's been ""too busy at work to let us know she's there"".

There has been periods of times I have not talked to her for months because of things she says and does. She’s broken into my room when I still lived with her to read my diary. Then used what she read against me. She called me up randomly once to tell me that my boyfriend (now fiancé) thought I was cheating on him (he didn’t, she just wanted to scare me, I didn’t cheat). She spent my childhood telling me I was too fat for anybody to really love me. She’s done more but this is just the blunt of it. I went all of 2017 not speaking to her. Every time she buys me something she’ll hold it against me later. Eventually we began speaking again early 2018. I have three siblings \[21M, 25F, 33M\], all who still live at home and have never moved out. They all have credit cards which allows them to buy whatever they want with my mother’s bank account. Not really relevant, but gives some background. 

I moved out when I was 18 and during June 2018, I moved across the country – 2,000 miles away from my closest family member. Last month, my fiancé(24M) and I closed on a house. We’ve been together for 5 years. 

My parents have not come to visit me since July 2018. So it’s been 11 months. I’ve been home to visit them 4 times since I moved down here. When I facetimed my parents to show them my new house, they told me they were going to give my fiancé and me a complete guest bedroom set as a housewarming present. Which we were incredibly grateful for. 

However, I told them on the phone that we needed the set by the end of June since we were going on vacation and are having my MIL come and stay in our house to watch our dogs. My dad was fine with this – my mother was not but eventually gave in. 

I’ve been sending her pictures of bedroom furniture that we’ve liked for a couple of weeks now with her responding “I don’t like it” to everything. The other day my fiancé and I went to IKEA to pick something out. We found something that we really loved and wasn’t too expensive. About $1000 for everything. I called my mother to tell her we found something we want and to ask how we were going to do it. 

Her response was “*Am I seriously buying furniture for your fiancés mom?*” Then she went on a rant saying that she wanted to pick everything out. She implied that even though she’s buying it as a present for us – it’s still going to be hers and she’s the only one that can use it. I reminded her that she said it was fine that we needed it by the end of June and that it is ridiculous that she wants to pick out furniture for our house and doesn’t want his mother to sleep in it first. Our conversation ended with the fact that we are now going to buy it ourselves. So we bought it ourselves. Now, my dad is making me feel bad for not accepting their present. He told me that my mother has been in bed crying for the past 3 days because I don’t love her. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2782j	2019-06-18 20:14:25	BenCraigKey	AITA for staying isolated from my lonely friend?	"For context:

My friend (I'll call him Jack) is my roommate and works at the same company as me. He recently got a 5am-1:30pm shift at work. We used to have the same shift of 11am-7:30pm shift. Given his change, he's ready for bed just as I get home and so we have no opportunity to hang out during the week at all.

He's recently got over some really bad depression issues and is doing very well with improving himself. We're a very nerdy household so we used to only play video games, but hes now out trying new things and seeing girls and working out and I couldn't be prouder of his improvement.

But as for me, I've had massive (clinical) depression issues myself. Luckily, when Jack was going through his most trying times, I was on a bit of an upswing with therapy and was able to support him at least a decent amount. But now my depression is worse than ever. For a full account, feel free to look into the post I made on r/bingeeatingdisorder. The most relevant of my issues with this though is that I desire nothing but isolation all of the damn time. I don't have the energy to hold a conversation at work, so when I get home, It results in me being locked in my room all day.

So Jack keeps pushing me to go out and do things with him. Mostly because he's been so lonely, though I'm sure he thinks it will help with my depression as well. I simply haven't had the energy to even move around the house, much less go for a 2 hour nature walk, or whatever Jack might suggest. Everytime he pushes me enough to go out to eat with him or watch a movie, I always feel like I'm being a downer for the mood with my lethargy, unhappy face, and unwillingness to participate in conversations. So it's kind of a lose-lose. He's lonely if I dont hang out with him, but I'm a bummer if I do. 

I know I should be trying harder to be there for him when I can, and that depression isnt excuse for being an asshole, but where's the line?"	No A-holes here	0	0

To clarify the relationship, I guess he would be my ""brother-in-law squared."" My wife has a sister, and BIL is married to said sister. So the in-laws in question are in-laws to both of us.

My wife was pregnant over last father's day. I (obviously) did not expect any fanfare and (obviously) did not receive any. I think someone made a joke about ""this'll be you next year huh?"" but that's about it. Made sense.

This year, my wife and I have a child and my SIL is pregnant. By a crazy coincidence, she's about as far along as my wife was at this time last year. Both my BIL and I were treated the same way this year by our in-laws - both given a Father's Day card and a small token present. I'm a little irritated because 1) I was not given any ""special treatment"" as a father-to-be while he is and 2) I feel like this took away from my first father's day. 

I do feel like I'm being a bit petty about this but I'm still kind of hurt by it. So this is really an internal dilemma leading to my post.

So am I being a petty asshole by being upset by this? Or is it reasonable to be?"	Asshole	0	0

c270ce	2019-06-18 19:57:45		WIBTA if I made an issue of a girl saying I'm out of shape?	"tl;dr: girl im close with says i'm out of shape over the phone when I implicate it's okay to gain weight.

I'm not too bent out of shape about this comment, but it did rub me the wrong way a bit. A bit of backstory, this girl (22f) and I (21m) dated for about a year. We broke up amicably for other reasons but are still close and will likely date later when the timing is a bit better for us (both in going to grad school, just want to focus on school for a bit). So we do have a history and have been talking and hanging out still. 

&#x200B;

Last night, we were on the phone, and she comments on how she feels like shes gaining weight. She's made a few comments like this before, and I've always said she looks good (not really a lie or anything, shes like 5'4 and \~100 pounds). At this most recent comment I don't recall my exact words, I said something along the lines of ""well.. it's not a big deal to get a bit..."" (probably about to say 'bigger' or something along those lines) and I didn't say anything but she basically thought I was calling her chubby. I never said the word, but she must have interpreted it that way and felt hurt at my hesitation. She basically immediately said ""oh my god were you going to call me chubby? well you're not in the best shape either"" and went off a bit.

 I was kinda hurt by this. Even though the comment is a bit true cuz i'm a bit skinny and not really muscular. my frame is alright though i am gaining a bit of weight but i'm still like 6'1 and 145 pounds so not anything crazy but again still not the best shape. I was not really super upset at the comment, since it's on me to go to the gym and rectify this in a few semesters, but I was not happy with how she immediately fired back at me at the slightest implication of me calling her bigger. Idk if she wants me to keep saying she's skinny cuz it makes her feel good or something, but it is a bit annoying that she will occasionally bring up her weight.. I wouldn't even mind if she were a bit bigger.  I don't know if i should read too much into this or if it indicates how she'll make issues about me if i bring something up to her. i just was hurt that she made it about me immediately.

WIBTA if I took what she said to heart  or should I move on about it? Like i said, the comment itself wasn't really what hurt me but more so how she made it about me. also I did sorta imply something about her weight, though I never said anything explicit but it seemed like she felt hurt over the phone too .thanks for reading, apologies for the long wall of text. i appreciate any advice. ty again"		1	0
c26za7	2019-06-18 19:55:31		AITA for constantly getting upset with my boyfriend’s drug habits when I’ve developed my own?	"I started drinking and getting high a lot more often since I met my boyfriend, but I still manage to set my priorities straight (like with college, etc) 

As for my boyfriend, he’s been drinking and smoking on the daily since he was 15. He is 21 now. He does not have an addictive personality, if he feels that he is drunk or high enough for the night, he will stop. 
But he still seems to feel the need to at least have something in him no matter the amount he eventually chooses to have by the end of the night. If that makes sense. He has cut down a bit on drinking, he drinks almost everyday but drinks less drinks a night than before. 

However because of this, it seems to have skewed his motivation to apply for school or do other things in the evening besides getting fucked up. 

AITA for doing the same things yet getting upset at him? To be honest...the only reason why I do these things is to accommodate to him or forget about him doing it in his own time when I’m not with him. Because it’s easier than other things. I’d drop everything if he never felt the need to do these things, or if we moved in for example. Whereas with him I really don’t think he would."	Everyone Sucks	1	0
c26z99	2019-06-18 19:55:27	goessgoess	AITA for being annoyed that my neighbors like to prop open our apartment building's door?	"I just moved to Denver, Colorado and I'm living in a big apartment complex. It seems like a safe enough area, but still, we're in a city and I don't know the area well. One of the reasons I chose this complex is because it's a secure; the exterior doors are constantly locked and require a key fob to enter. All of the doors are like this except for one, and it's the one I most frequently use. You can exit from it, but you can't re-enter as there's no key fob thing - I'm not sure why.

Anyway, almost every time I leave my apartment through this door, I noticed that it's being propped open by a rock. At first I didn't think much of it, I assumed that maybe someone was just taking their dog out for a quick potty break or something. However, that's not the case; this door is *always* being propped open at every hour of the day. I've started removing the rocks from the doorway, however a new one reappears each time I come back.

This bothers me because I don't like the idea that anyone can enter our complex. Part of me thinks I'm being paranoid, but part of me also believes that it's wrong to do this; it completely defeats the purpose of a secure community. It's also not like there are no other doors nearby; there's a keyed entrance that takes about 15 seconds to walk to from the door in question.

Today I decided to leave a note (maybe not the best idea in hindsight) at the door, it read: ""Please do not put rocks in the doorway, it defeats the purpose of a secure community. There's a door on the other side that takes only a few seconds to get to. Thanks! :)"" I came back about 2 hours later to find the note ripped into pieces and thrown on the floor. Maybe I shouldn't have left a note, I just didn't want to bother management and I thought the problem could be resolved by just trying to communicate with whoever is doing this, however that clearly didn't work.

Am I being an a-hole by being upset that someone (or multiple people) is propping open the doorway to our apartment complex? I just don't feel completely safe knowing that anyone can get into the building. Also, the door faces a busy road and sidewalk, meaning tons of people walk by all the time. We're also right next to a metro and bus stop. It's a busy area.

I don't want to be seen as the grumpy neighbor, but I also don't like feeling unsafe. WIBTA for reporting this to management? /was I an asshole for leaving a note?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c26ysv	2019-06-18 19:54:28	davy89irox	WIBTA if I made my wife get rid of the cat?	"Some background:  My wife and I just had our 1 year wedding anniversary, she's the best I worship the ground she walks on so when she wants something I do my best to come through and make sure she has it. Before we got married she wanted to get a cat & I was all about it I love cats and raising a pet together would be good practice for having a kid or 2 in the future. 
So we hop into the car and go down to the animal shelter and after not seeing a connection with the cats & preparing to leave, this one cat litterally reaches out and taps me on the shoulder. I ask to meet him, seems like a sweet boy we take him home. 
He was an okay cat, he's had a couple medical issues that we have tackled together but it usually relates to bathroom issues. He has had bladder infections, and an obstructed bowel. I've spent like 2500$ on keeping this cat alive.

Now that I have established I have been in this cats corner, here's my issue.  The boy pees and shits on all of my stuff. Coats in my closet, pants, rugs, carpet, his favorite is towels on the bathroom floor. My wife always defends him saying he has issues and I try to remember he's just a cat and press on and be more careful with my stuff.

But today the cat pissed in the most important thing I own the shoes I got married in. My wife and I came up with the idea of being really dressy but wearing brand new Vans instead of fancy shoes. These were my favorite shoes ever, I wore them all the time, took good care of them and cleaned them, because every time I looked at then I saw my wife walking down the isle. I literally cannot convey how much these shoes meant to me, and now they are destroyed.

And this isn't a little pee and I'm not the one that caught him. My wife noticed it while I was cooking breakfast and he peed for a long time, I couldn't help but cry.  Like I'm fucking heartbroken. Those shoes were priceless and irreplaceable and every time I look at the cat I feel so much rage I can hardly contain myself. I just want to get rid of him. I don't want to have to look at him any more because every time I look at him I'm see him pissing in my wedding shoes. 

Thanks for reading, I know this is a long one, but I want the nuance to be understood. 

Tl;Dr my cat pissed in my wedding shoes and I want to get rid of him. 

What do I do? Would I be an asshole for talking about this with my wife? Is it an asshole move to set an ultimatum regaurding getting rid of the cat?

--------------------- EDIT:
So clearly I would be the asshole here. Thankfully I asked y'all before my wife, so thank you friends of Reddit. Some folks have given me some tips on how to maybe help Kent (the cat) as well as a few others with how I can fix my shoes. 

So feel free to continue in here, I am still going to read and respond. So thanks again for your time."	Asshole	0	0

c26xf0	2019-06-18 19:51:27		AITA, for being distracted during the dnd campaign?	"I (20f if it matters) was playing dnd (table top game) with my friends last Sunday. I say friends, but I am not particularly close with any of them and usually only meet those people at gaming events. So, I got invited to play couple of dnd games. A one shot and a long campaign. 
I just came back from abroad and honestly I have a lot of things going on. I have a full time and two part time jobs, mental health issues etc. During the first one shot game on Sunday I looked at my phone couple of times (3 to be exact) and, even though I was mostly really engaged and role played my Orc as much as I could, sometimes I was getting a bit lost. Just cause I’m so tired all the time. 
I honestly didn’t think that it was affecting the game much. But today, in preparation for the long campaign, DM (player who runs the game and creates plot) was asking what I liked and what not about her game(which was really good on her part). And then told me that she hated how I “looked in my phone all the time” (which wasn’t true) and that I was lost and distracted which is really disrespectful to her as DM and spoils the game. 
I honestly didn’t think it was such a big deal. Dnd does take effort especially on DMs part(and our DM was great and did a lot of preparations), but I went there to have fun not yet another job. Obviously if I would constantly distract people and mess with the plot I would get the complain, but I am pretty positive I was engaged most of the time. So AITA?"		1	0

c26vxj	2019-06-18 19:48:08	whocaredsbsb	WIBTA for telling my friend my feelings have been hurt and potentially 'stirring the pot' with his GF?	"I [27F] have a very close friend [28M] who has a girlfriend [28F] who, plainly put, does not like me.

Before I get into this, its important to note that I am a bisexual woman with a strong preference for other women. I usually call myself ""queer"" or ""gay"" because I don't have any interest in dating men, but very rarely I will find a man attractive. I'm still figuring out what I am and whether or not men are even in the mix. My close friends who I have come out to know this about me. My friend is a bisexual male. His girlfriend is straight, and I have never met her (more on this later). 

I have absolutely no interest in my friend, sexually or romantically. Both because of the gay thing and, even if he were close to my non-existent male tastes, we value completely different things in our relationships. We both know this and have talked about it, and I've made explicitly clear that if he ever made a move on me our friendship would be over. There is zero chance of there ever being anything between us. 

Pride is this month, and its my first June being (somewhat) out of the closet. I have only recently come out to my close friends and am still closeted with my family. My friend has gone to Pride with his GF in the past, so I asked if they were going this year. If not, would he want to go with me? If they were, would I be able to tag along, or would his GF not want me third-wheeling? I told him explicitly that if she didn't want me there that was fine, just to please let me know so I can make plans. All I wanted was a yes or no.

After a week of waiting to hear about this, last night I asked him if he had talked to his GF about Pride or not. Rather than just saying ""No, she doesn't want you coming along"", he ended up telling me how much she dislikes me. 

WIBTA for saying to my friend that my feelings have been hurt? Partly in being told how much I'm disliked, partly in having to wait around for an answer on plans, both of which were not necessary when (again) I explicitly said ""just tell me yes or no, it's fine if she doesn't want me there""? I am also feeling particularly salty about the fact that I now know she has actively avoided meeting me. I don't intend on not being friends with him just because I'm a girl, but I do realize that no matter how much we reassure her or how gay I am, she will still always be uncomfortable with me being around. Maybe that's why I'm so upset that she refuses to meet me--I feel like her avoiding me is making me into this boogeyman character far more than I actually am.

c26vnk	2019-06-18 19:47:32		AITA for not wanting to travel to see my (23f) parents more than twice a year while I'm in school?	"I mostly get along with my parents, but I'm an only child, and they were predictably overprotective. When I was 19, I dropped out of college to deal with some mental health issues and moved back in with them--unfortunately, this was right after they'd decided to move to another state 1000 miles away. I, severely depressed and with no money to my name, went with them. I lived with them for a year until I worked through the worst of my depression and saved up enough money to move to my home city. 

I've been living there on my own for 3 years now (I'm 23), working in a restaurant and paying the majority of my expenses. After a couple years of waiting tables, I decided to finally go back to school at the local state university, and my mom graciously offered to pay. The past year I've been in school full-time, including summer classes, and will be for the next 2 years. I still work as much as I can (\~25-30 hours a week), and have managed to maintain a 4.0 and keep up with expenses. 

My mom is thrilled I'm doing so much better, but is intent on seeing each other often. She plans 3-6 day-long trips nearly every 3 months--sometimes my state, sometimes theirs, sometimes at different cities in between. She pays for the whole thing (all I have to do is get a ride to the airport). This was a lot easier when I wasn't in school, but now that my schedule is fuller and I'm working fewer hours, any time I have to take off work to go out of town upsets my budget. She at least doesn't plan trips mid-semester; instead she'll look up my school schedule online and claim dibs on the one-two weeks I have in between semesters, i.e. the only time I have to work more, or go on trips with my friends, or just take a few days to hang out and get my life together before school starts again. 

I've tried explaining this to her, and for a bit I thought she understood--like last year, I skipped Thanksgiving but went for Christmas, and it was fine. But last night, she began laying out plans for a trip during Labor Day, plus Thanksgiving, plus Christmas. I started to say no, that it sounded too expensive, but she got upset, saying she just missed me and that money's not an issue. 

AITA? I feel like a brat for even complaining. I'm incredibly privileged that my parents can not only pay for my school out of pocket, but also afford all these plane tickets/vacations. Also, they're getting older, and I feel like the least I can do is spend time with them while they're still here. On these trips, I get to travel the country and honestly live a much higher quality life than my one back home (nice restaurants, skiing, shopping sprees, etc.). But when's the point where I officially live my own life and plan my time on my own terms? 

TLDR I live 1000mi away from my parents, who pay for my school. They expect me to drop everything and fly out for random visits/vacations 4x a year, which they also pay for. AITA for wanting to limit trips to twice a year?"	No A-holes here	1	0

"Ok so if you're catholic theres a little something called corpus Christie (or some shit idk) going on this week.  My mom is a strong Catholic (not a jesus freak but she believes the catholic faith hard).  My views on religion are...questionable and she's already made peace with this as I didn't abandon religion altogether, I still go to church with her sometimes just because it makes her happy.  We are on vacation in Poland visiting family and the corpus Christie procession is taking place on Thursday. This is a problem as certain circumstances already pissed away half the vacation and I really don't feel like attending a 2 hour church ceremony on my vacation after 2 days of fun (didn't reach the second day yet but I know where we're going and it's one of my favorite places to go when I'm here).  The thing I hate the most about corpus Christie (I know hate is a strong word but I've had genuine contempt for this holiday since I was a kid) is that you have to walk around outside as a parish and kneel in front of several altars.  If you've never kneeled on a street before don't try it, it is fucking painful. My mom didn't know about it until today because it usually takes place on Sunday instead of Thursday and she pretty much told me I dont have a choice in whether or not I'm going.  I'm 18 if it matters.

Long story short: I don't want to go to a religious holiday ceremony but my mom is forcing me to.

c26skh	2019-06-18 19:40:37		AITA? Am I an Imposter in dev-tech field ?	"Hello to all, i need a little bit of help. This is my current situation:

I'm having an interniship with a good webdev agency - they worked for rito games, wizard of the coast, and a lot of high brand of dress - today it's my second month of experience in this field and I haven't a science background (and they know it, I'm not a liar :) ) .

During the training of the first month we see redux saga, redux and a little bit of react native, only on little fake projects just to learn.

After the first month of training they sent me to another web agency, completely alone to make a solo project.

This project is about a money management tool, we are using react as tech stack. I said to my manager that this project was out of my possibility, because...i've a fuckin month of experience + at the beginning i didn't even know how to use git. But he said to me "" you will make it ""

After the first week, thanks to god, another front end join to help us.

During the second month i worked like the hell and i learnt how to use redux thunk, redux form, immutableJs, how to make a good login ( i made it ) and how to use git ( base commands + rebase + how to work in team).

Actually in one month of contribution of this project i made:

* login
* logout
* CustomAvatar ( like in google where you see your nickname and your initial )
* a modal
* the main redirect after the login based on your role
* the verify token
* the animated loader between a page and another
* animated loader on the login
* error handler for the login
* the header of login page
* the tooltips on every button
* a lateral search of four inputs
* i learnt git ( now i'm happy to use it, i also know how to rebase and resolve conflicts )
* i learnt redux thunk, redux saga, redux form, react css module.

I love what i do, i love to code and we have and hard deadline.

in these days they called another front end Developer, probably to replace me at the end of this month.

I have to say that this thought it's only a personal sensation. The starting contract between the two agencies is of one month, no one day more, nor less.

now the actual project manager is clearly bipolar, sometimes yell, sometimes is the best person of the world... Some days ago he just yelled and had a public verbal offense against this new senor developer. But i think that this is because of the hard deadline ( we had only month to sent this project to the customer.

He yelled at me because one night i took the decision to work 3 hours more ( without asking money, and no i'm not jooking )

What i've to think about it ? I'm feeling really sad, and every fuckin mistake that I made is a knife in my heart. I'm really feeling disappointed by my self.

I'm not demovating to quit this job, but really...how can i face this situation ? I'm strongly convinced that my web agency just oversells me ( without any fuckin good reason )"		1	0

"So I suffer from depression as well, I also do therapy from time to time, but I’ve been feeling better since I stopped overthinking. I used to workout all the time, and that really helps me. I told her that a while ago, my therapist said to see if working out on a consistent basis still helps me, and if not then I should try medication. I told the therapist this is what worked for me in the past so I was going to get back on a workout schedule. 

When I told my friend this she said that is horrible that my therapist said that to me because “working out doesn’t cure mental illness.” I told her that it helps tremendously when you try, but it doesn’t cure everything. I told her that mental illness is a reason but not an excuse to improve your health and life. 

She is constantly depressed that it’s a major topic of conversation, in public she always said she’s anxious despite therapy and medication. I told her “try going on walks, you live right by a bike path, I think just five minutes a day could help a lot.” And then she goes on to explain that people have been murdered (?) on that bike path and that she has “never been an exercise person.” 

I feel bad for even mentioning this. The denial is just so frustrating. Every time I say “oh hey, I went hiking today.” It’s pure negativity and “I hate hiking and walking.” Like good for you? 

She is incredibly overweight and she’s a good friend, but I truly think she would feel so much more confident and happier if she tried. I don’t think working out is a cure, but it’s good to start eating healthier for the sake of your body and mind.

c26nu9	2019-06-18 19:29:59		AITA for suggesting my friend get a different therapist?	"A little backstory: my friend has serious issues. We all do, but she seems to think I’m her therapist and just constantly complains to me. The constant negativity started taking a toll on me, because I also have mental health issues and I’m dealing with major life issues myself. Over the last few years she has kind of used me to unload allllll her complaints and personal issues constantly. Like she constantly texts me with any minor inconvenience and all of it is just nagging and complaining. Recently, she had a very very dark depressive episode and “unintentionally” almost overdosed. That was a super trigger for me. I called her husband, suggested he get her into some kind of mental hospital because it’s out of hand. During the time she was away I helped her husband and family get her home back in order (she hadn’t cleaned at all since they moved in to this house months ago and has a whole bunch of dogs). She ended up not liking the place she was checked in to as outpatient and immediately started complaining to me about it. Of course that was upsetting for me, because I feel like she takes more from me than she gives, and told her to find another place then. She knew she was out of line because she immediately said she wasn’t ungrateful, but that this didn’t help her at all. I was upset and took a break from talking to her after explaining to her that her constant negativity affected the people around her. Stopped replying to messages and even deactivated my other social media accounts. Like I said, I too have mental health issues and my situation is pretty severe where hers is self  and self inflicted to an extent. I would share where her problems are stemming from but it’s irrelevant. I took a break for a few weeks and like a week ago after I opened up my social media accts and saw it appeared she was doing much better I asked how she was doing. That immediately opened the door for more complaining about the exact same things. Today she text me and said her therapist doesn’t want to see her anymore because she’s “so well adjusted and doesn’t understand why she’s even seeing her” which is obviously a lie because no one recovers from alcoholism and depression in a few weeks.

This is where I might have been an asshole.

I replied back and said “either you’re lying or you need to see a new therapist because that therapist only sees the 60 minutes you present to her”

Now she won’t talk to me. I’m kind of relieved but kind of feel like I might have been an asshole."		1	0

c26lpo	2019-06-18 19:25:22	jarekrictus	AITA for ditching my life in one state and moving across the country?	"There's really no way to make this long story short, but I'll try:

I was working in (insert big city name here) and my apartment lease was at the end. I couldn't afford the rent increase and was looking for other places to stay. My mother and her roommate offered my family to stay in a house owned by her roommate, Bill, which had been unoccupied for the last 20 years.

Being out of options, and hey, a whole house all to ourselves, plus way cheaper rent, we jumped on the opportunity. We were told rent was going to be $500. When we signed the lease, which just had our names and Bills, the owner of the house, it went to $750, to cover utilities. Whatever.

My mother decided that, even though she has nothing to do with the house, since she pays all the bills at THEIR house because Bill is retired and she runs a daycare business, she would assume our utilities under her name, even though we asked her not to. In the first month we had our water shut off because she didnt pay the bill, and we had 3-4 notices of our electricity being shut off before we left.

Being that my girlfriend and I worked an hour and a half away at both comission jobs, it wasn't really all we had hoped it was, and before long we couldn't afford it. I told my mom and Bill and I was told to not worry about it and to focus on my other bills. I have a few thousand dollars coming my way from tax and army things, which I told them about and I have every plan to use that money to pay them what they're owed. 

I had quit my job so I could find a job in the small town we were living in to try to save money. I looked for weeks and still haven't heard a call back. Then I got a text from my mother saying she feels taken advantage of, and she wanted us to vacate the house. So we packed up essentially the clothes on our backs and moved to stay with my girlfriends mom across the country until we get on our feet. We both also have jobs here now, too.

So. Essentially, am I the asshole for just picking up and leaving? There's a lot more to go into, but the relevancy of the details is meh."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c26kb4	2019-06-18 19:22:15		AITA For not replacing my friends jumper?	"Reddit I need you to weigh in here because this thing has been so blown out of proportion I can't see clearly. 

Basically, I had a few friends come over last night and one of them loves my cat. She always seeks her out when shes at my place, but last night the cat wasn't around. 

A short time later I went to get another round of drinks and low and behold, the cat! So I scooped her up and went and put her on my friend. 

The cat wasn't too happy and ran off, but her claw got stuck on my friends jumper which now has a hole in it. 

I immediately apologised but my friend was going apeshit because her jumper was new and she wanted me to buy her a new one. Tbf I probably would have if she had calmed the hell down and not immediately started on a shouty rant to the rest of my friends about her ruined jumper.

And I haven't replied yet because I don't think I'm obligated to give expensive gifts. My reasoning is that's he's barely turning 3, I don't regularly see or talk to this sister or nephew because they live in Canada and I live in the US, I have never even bought the kid a gift before, nor does he even really know who I am. I told my other sibling that I do talk to regularly and she says I'm an asshole because it's a once in a while thing and I'm supposedly his godfather (I had no idea). However, I don't like the idea of an estranged sibling coming out of the woodworks asking for expensive gifts.

c26f6e	2019-06-18 19:10:43	Wingsy1458	AITA for No Call, No Showing a job?	"I recently moved into a new state and decided to try to branch off into a different field of work. I have been work in health care, but have decided to pursue working with animals. I have always enjoyed working with animals and thought that it now or never. I already made a big life change with moving. So I began working at a Kennel to gain some hands on experience. 

The job is a small, family run business. The kennel is next door to the Boss’ house. There are 3 workers, will call them M, L and J, J being the Boss’ daughter. From the first day of work (I worked there for almost a month), I was to be trained by M. I got rubbed the wrong way by him since day 1. Just got weird vibes. On the 1st shift I worked, I accidentally fed a dog the wrong food because he just threw me into everything & didn’t explain the labeling system for the food. He didn’t want to answer my questions, kept showing off it felt. Wanted to assert his dominance p quickly. Whatever. 

I’m 3 shifts in, and he is still training me. I’m continually getting more and more bad vibes from him. He starts yelling at the dogs to be quiet in a really unnecessary manner, calling the dogs disgusting and making comments about how he hates dogs. 

Finally the breaking point came when we did 11 am let outs. A dog had messed in it’s kennel and he FLIPS. Starts cussing, swearing, kicking at the dogs, throwing buckets and shit. One dog won’t go out and he shoved her out the metal kennel doors. I tell him to go take a second and he ignores me. I left my shift at 11:30 am, and called the boss. I was so furious I was ready to quit. She talks me down, promises I won’t have to work with him, begs me not to leave. Makes excuses for his behaviors, saying he emotional and probably intimidated by me (I was in nursing, this kid is going to school to be a nurse, etc). I end up agreeing to stay.

Flash forward a week and I haven’t worked with him, the boss and J are training me, I haven’t seen M in a while. Then, I find out he left a dog unattended on the groom table & the dog almost HUNG ITSELF. He isn’t fired. 
I eventually had to work with him. I had a morning shift 2 days ago with L and M. The minute the Boss leaves to go back to her house, L and M start acting like assholes. I was being ignored & spoken to like a child. All of a sudden, M pulls me into the grooming room and tells me to get a little dog and put them on the grooming table. He says he is going to teach me something. He goes to grab a brush and he knocks things over. He FLIPS out, starts cussing and getting v angry. The dog gets scared. Luckily I’m holding her. L comes running in, asking him “are you okay, M?” He goes “Just fucking stab me in the heart or fucking shoot me.” He completely fucking lost it. 

I walked out of that shift and haven’t gone back. I can’t believe after everything the Boss was willing to keep him on and not fire him. If he does these things around a brand new person, what is he doing when he is on shift alone???"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c26d5v	2019-06-18 19:06:01	hypexeled	AITA for not wanting to visit my family more than once a month?	"OK, so this has been somewhat ongoing lately, and my parents have started not so much liking the part where i refuse to go to the weekend lunch that the family (Mother's side) does each weekend. 

Almost everyone than can go, does, so usually it ends up being something that my mother likes doing every weekend, and my father kind of goes but i don't think he's overly enthusiastic about it.

I'm 21 (Turning 22 this year), and live at home with parents. My situation however comes at the fact that I work full time during the day (9AM to 6PM) and then go to university (College for Americans?) during the night. Usually i get home around 11.20PM, which leaves me enough time to browse reddit for 20 ish minutes while having dinner and another 15 for whatever i do before then going to bed (12-12.30).

So, as a result, weekends have become essentially my only free time (When I'm not studying for exams), so having to spend almost half day of it (I like to sleep in till 10AM on weekends and stay in bed until 12AM at least, watching Netflix or reading a book), every weekend is not exactly the most appealing thing ever (40min drive both ways +2-3 hours between lunch and after table conversations). I'd be somewhat okay with doing it once a month, but my mother wants to push it to be twice alternating.

Its also partly because its a 40min drive to get there, and i'm kinda stuck until my parents feel like they have finished catching up (They are against going in two cars, and i kinda agree on that point).

c26cmz	2019-06-18 19:04:53		AITA for wanting my boyfriend to boycott his family vacation because I’m not invited?	"I’ll try to give as much context as I can. Me and my boyfriend have been together almost 3 years. We spend most of our time together at one of our houses (we’re in college so we don’t have a place yet.) He’s been on vacation with my family, and I’ve been on one with his a couple years ago. This year, while talking about the vacation they plan to take, his mom said in front of me, “We don’t plan on taking any ‘extras’ this time.” I was pretty hurt by this, as my mom would NEVER call him an ‘extra’, we consider him part of the family. My feelings are hurt by not being invited, as this is the third time in a row they have gone on vacation without me and called me an “extra.” I get wanting some family time I guess, but really, it’s hurtful that at this point I’m not part of the family enough. Like, I spend tons of time at their house, I go to their Christmas dinner every year, I’ve met the entire extended family, I spent months knitting a baby blanket for my bf’s uncle’s new baby. They say I’m part of the family, but don’t treat me like it. My family takes my boyfriend on vacation whenever we can (not every time because we can’t afford a big room, my parents make significantly less money than his.) We include him in everything, when we grocery shop we get what he wants, when we go out to eat he is always covered. 
It’s not a money issue or a space issue for them, they just dropped 70k on a brand new suburban that we could all easily fit in (they only have one other child besides my bf.) They also wouldn’t have to spend any more on a room to take me, because they always spend enough so that everyone has their own bed (so me and bf could sleep in the same one.) 
So, bf told me he wouldn’t go on the vacation unless I am invited. I didn’t make or even ask him to say this, but I’m glad he did. This will likely cause some strife within the family. I feel weird about it but it’s also like come on, I want to be part of the family too. This is the THIRD time. So, am I justified in wanting him to boycott the vacay, or am I just an entitled a-hole?"		1	0

So basically as the title says, I (27F) found out today that my grandma died (Dad's stepmom). Which while sad, I'm not terribly broken up about. We weren't very close. I can count on two hands the amount of interactions we've had. This isn't because I disliked her in any way, my immediate family just moved far away from everyone so we never really interacted. 

The issue comes that I'm not sure when the funeral is going to be, but it may conflict with a pretty big event that my bf and I have had planned for a while and I have a strong feeling he's going to propose at said event and I'm very excited and happy about it. I want to be with him and *fingers crossed* if he's going to propose here, he really knows me well :)

My mother is going to flip out if I don't go, even though we weren't close cause ""family"".

c267v1	2019-06-18 18:54:13	AzraelKanchi	AITA Questionable Discord Friend Blocked	"	The first time I decided to add people on my discord I didn’t know I got two actually super awesome people. They ran a decent little server that I joined as well and overall have a great time with. Because of this experience I started to add more people. Everything was great until the last person that I had added that we will call Seth. Seth started out okay... until it got a bit strange. Seth started asking me questions about what my type was, asking if he was good enough for me. I made it very clear that I was not searching for a relationship at the moment. 
	The questions kept going and he kept giving me compliments about how cute I was, and when I said that I wasn’t open for relationship, he said he wasn’t trying to get one but it was his long term goal. He started asking me questions about what my kinks are later that night... which was very strange considering when he talked about kinky role play earlier I specifically said I only do that with my BOYFRIEND. I said I wasn’t open. I said I had a bf. He just kept pushing. When I asked him to stop he said “Sorry I kinda hate who I am”. I asked why and he said “Because I get turned on too easily and ask stuff like I did”. 
	He knew that I drew NSFW art as an artist and tried to talk me into showing him some as well. He asked “will you show me anime titties when you’re done drawing sexy pics? C;” 
I told him no and explained how uncomfortable it made me. He then proceeded to try and explain how he wasn’t using them for pleasure but rather he was just curious. What else is hentai for?? 
	He kept getting offended over weird things like when I said I wanted to voice chat while we game because I think it’s more fun to rather than because I wanted to hear his voice?? Or when I said I loved his cat he was sad I didn’t say I loved him. 
	I sent screenshots of our conversations to trusted friends and bf and asked them for their advice on what I should do because he seemed nice all the other times and he said he didn’t have any friends and was depressed and I didn’t want to be mean and block him. I was told that he was using depression as a manipulative tactic to get me to do what he wants. And that he will keep pushing until he got it. My boyfriend got upset and kept asking for permission to yell at him. I was told he didn’t deserve my responses and that I need to block him because he was scum. 
	SO I decided to tell him that I was done talking to him and explained why. He said he didn’t know I felt that way and that he wasn’t trying to manipulate. But he will get out of my life and fuck him I guess. I said K bye, and he called me an asshole and blocked me himself... Part of me is really worried that I was reading too far into things and I left someone who was actually hurting. I didn’t send my friends ALL the screenshots of ALL our conversations where he was acting okay. Part of me still feels bad for him, and I really need to know if I really am the asshole like he said."

c2676q	2019-06-18 18:52:42	halkiwebb	WIBTA if I tell my friend that sometimes talking to her feels like walking on eggshells	"My friend recently discovered her fiancé had been cheating on her since two months into their relationship. She is understandably distraught but part of her grief involves her falling back into the habit of randomly being angry at everyone around her for little to no reason. She complains about some things like how she has acne but if I try to recommend things to help like certain face soaps, creams, and moisturizers that help and responds with “Halki you’re lucky I’m on the other side of the planet right now or I would murder you.” (She lives in the same city as me but is overseas currently.)

Because of her aggressive response to help I try not to say too much to her because she doesn’t really seem to want advice. All of our friends in our discord server however always ask me to talk to her and make sure she’s okay when she’s having troubles but if I say anything she blows up at me. One time I snapped back at her when she was trying to sort out funding for her university (as in Canada she gets it paid for). Essentially she couldn’t figure it out and said that she should just give up and not bother because it’s too hard. 

As someone who will never get to go to post secondary because I will never be able to afford it this pissed me off because why would you not go if you don’t have to worry financially? I said “I’m sorry free education is such a hardship for you.” And she blew up at me calling me racist and pinged everyone in the discord to yell at me.  I know that was a dick move on my part and I deserved that but I have since apologized and she has since forgiven me. Today she brought up the fact out of no where that she’s upset that she can’t trust any of her friends and that every single one has been racist towards her. 

Obviously not wanting to be racist in any way I asked her if I had said something wrong because we were just having a nice conversation when she suddenly became aggressive. Her response was “recently? No.” I don’t understand why she’s mad at me if I didn’t even do anything wrong. I know I can’t expect her to ever fully forgive me or get over what I said in the past and all that but still. 

It really does feel like I have to tip toe around conversations when I talk to her lately so as to not make her upset and I know if I tell her this she’ll either get mad at me or get immensely upset with herself and worsen her depression orrrrr both. Knowing this, WIBTA if I tell her anyways?

Edit/update: in case anyone wants it, I tried to talk it out with her and she basically ignored everything I tried to say and commented on how I was just upset she didn’t want friends being racist towards her? I don’t understand WHERE that came from since I didn’t bring it up at all and the conversation kept spieling while she refused to listen to anything I was trying to say. My fiancé came home to find me crying about it and he decided to message her about it which prompted her to say something like “I love how you’re complaining about me not wanting racist people in my life yet you dragged in your white boyfriend to get mad at me about it” 

Anyways it ended up with her blocking me on everything, shit talking me to my friends who in turn blocked me on everything and now I have no friends. All my fiancé says is “well they weren’t your real friends, you can always make more” which is true but I’m so upset that me trying to reach out to a friend and ask if anything I’m doing is bothering her turned into this."

c264vm	2019-06-18 18:47:31	NickMaate	AITA: Ignored all day & feeling hurt makes me bad.	"TL;DR at the bottom.

I feel very divided on something that happened today, I feel a certain amount of guilt but also I feel that I'm being made to feel that way because of the negative feeling this other person is at the time.

A friend (I'll call them Dee) who I hadn't seen in ages and I had made arrangements to see each other on a specific day (today as of writing). We had agreed on today in advance without specific plans for what we'd do - we talked about driving, having a walk in the park or going to a coffee shop.

The day arrives and I wake up surprisingly early in the morning, thinking they wouldn't be awake yet I waited until around 10am and shot them a quick direct message on snapchat: ""Hiya, what time did you wanna meet up for whatever we're doing?"". I then went about doing daily things, like feeding pets and the such.

6 hours later Dee hadn't even opened the message and I had been doing practically nothing all day waiting to go out, I didn't want to start any task that would take some time because I wanted to be able to leave ASAP; meaning I was bored up to my eyeballs with tedious things to pass the time.

I post a little hand-drawn comic to a little Instagram account I have about being aired over plans and a person not caring enough to tell you that they don't want to come out, or they're busy or just don't want to see you; with a bit at the end about unfriending people who don't have time for you. Almost immediately after I post this comic I get a message from Dee saying that she'd been having a rough day - so I said it was fine and we started planning the day out.

At this point I remembered why she'd been having a rough day - in the UK it had been fathers day and she'd lost her dad years ago. It made sense, we'd talked about how she had avoided social media because of all the posts people make about their fathers. I immediately didn't think she'd been avoiding me & that I had been in my head about people not liking me.

She then found the comic. Said that she was sorry that her dad passing was an inconvenience to me. I was mortified, I felt terrible. I said that I'd obviously only been thinking about myself and that I was truly sorry.

I've been thinking about it for a while and although, yes its sad - I've had that sinking feeling in your heart, the one when you realise something terrible. However, she would have seen the notification was a direct message from me, not some person talking about fathers day (that was now two days ago), and that we had plans that day. She could've said that she wasn't feeling up to it or that she'd want to do something later in the day, but she just left me hanging for 6 hours.

I don't know what to think. I feel terrible but on the other hand I feel like I'm not completely at fault.

&#x200B;

Bit of background info; 
I'm a 22f Since I graduated I have worked flat out for the last 6 years saving money, getting qualifications an trying my best to be a good person. Living independently in another state away from family and being responsible as possible.
My sibling 21m on the other hand dropped out 2 years before graduation hasnt acomplished a single thing since. Has been living off dole money, holding a job for a day then quitting. He openly admits he doesn't want to work and money can't make him happy. Yet he asks for things that require money he doesnt have. in doing this he has finiacially burdened everyone who's come into contact with. He's been given so many opportunities to learn or work an shoved them back in people's faces. 

In the last 2 years he's been getting more spiritual he's very involved with crystals and energy healing and related things. He's said he's a prophet, and that he can cure cancer. This offends me deeply as our grandmother is actually dying of cancer and for him to suggest that he can cure it with some rocks makes me upset more than words can describe. 

Now this morning I woke up to 3 different people messaging me asking if I know what's going on with my brother. 
He posts a lot of nonsense about being a wizard and namaste and claiming he's got all these life tips and that he's  special because he's a spiritual healer. 
My brothers posted a video of him doin wild fucked up whale noises in a sewerage drain saying it's frequency healing. 
The video goes for 5 minutes and I couldn't make it past 10 seconds it was such a horrid r/sadcringe moment. 
I commented on it I feel I shouldn't have but I'm so sick of getting messages from people. I just said that this is getting to be absolute nonsense and said anyone who actually believes in this has fried their brain on hallucinagenics. Now obviously this kicked it off. And he's saying before I judge him I should take a look at myself and a lotta backwards talk. 

Now my mum & other family members says I'm the asshole because I should just let him do what he wants and he's happy so why should I put my 2 cents in.
She's also the mum who only answer my calls and messages once a year when she needs something. 

I want the best for him. I can't keep dealing with this and having my mum enable his mental illness is just driving me mad in the process. 
I've blocked the both of them on all social media's to stop me from dealing with daily embarrassment. 

Am I the assholes for saying something to my sibling about his spiritual delusions?
 I don't know how to explain to him that it's not normal or productive to be wailing in a drainpipe on a workday. 
And I've stressed to him that our mutual friends have been messaging me worried about his mental health and asking me if he's on drugs

c25zu4	2019-06-18 18:36:33		AITA for thinking my family caters too much to family members with a handicap toddler whose mother never expresses gratitude/ acts entitled?	Long story, but I’ll make it short as possible. family weekend for Father’s Day combined with handicap toddler’s birthday. Rented a house for large family group. House had two bathrooms, one master bath in a master bedroom and one tiny hallway bathroom. Family members with HC toddler are given master bedroom (family of 3, mom, dad, and toddler) due to extra equipment and items needed to accommodate HC child. Said child sleeps in bed with parents, in diapers and requires a special stroller, feeding tube machine etc. Every evening said child is put down to sleep at abt 7:30p- 8p, everyone else is up, playing games, watching movies, socializing, etc. as it gets later, children need baths, adults need showers, and multiple people need bathroom use, but are restricted to using broom bathroom that is smaller than a broom closet. Family said in beginning, other members can use their bathroom, however the mom was overheard whisper yelling with dad abt a family member asking to use the master shower after HC toddler was put down for bed because she didn’t want the HC child to be woken. Dad was saying it was fine, mom was the one with issue, which IMO is the one who acts more entitled than grateful, no expression of gratitude for birthday presents, or sacrificing larger space for them)This family was also the last to wake in the mornings, and upon waking monopolized the master bathroom and left their toiletries all over the counters and shelves as though it was their private bathroom from day 1. (I literally had to pee so bad one morning, the broom closet was in use, their bedroom door was shut locked and not awake, so I had to go find a tree outside to squat and relieve myself!) Mind you, each family paid equal portion of the lodging, some ended up sleeping on cots, couches, and “hallway” beds(read, NO privacy). Am I the asshole for thinking this family was extremely inconsiderate to the needs of the rest of the family that was considerate enough to give them the biggest space and the least they could have done was return the generosity and been more accommodating to the group in return? I understand they need special accommodations, but the child is only 3, in diapers, sleeps in the bed with them, doesn’t need special treatment to to the point of being inconsiderate of others comfort to that extreme, we’re all parents to a 3 year old at some point, and have dealt with the disruption in schedules encountered on holiday weekends and vacations, it sucks, but it’s pretty much expected and I don’t think their expectations should have been any different. If so the right thing would have been to secure separate lodging, they’re not strapped for cash.		1	0
c25yoo	2019-06-18 18:34:04	Wampus20	AITA for lying to my friend about bringing a certain guy over to my place?	"Here’s my first post on this sub. So here goes. 

I am having a small get together Friday with friends it’s gonna include drinking and playing games and stuff. In total there is gonna be 8 people but I could fit more of I really wanted to.

Well she texted me earlier today and was like hey can I bring this guy we’ll call him Jerry (not actual name) over or do you guys not like him? 

Honestly our whole friend group does not like this guy. We’re pretty sure he’s racist and he’s like a person you’d see in trashy people subreddits. Like he’ll say the n-word and he’s white and he’ll just use it to refer to people like that and other people racial slurs. He really brings down the whole vibe.

So, I told her I can only fit 8 people in my apartment and that she can’t bring him. (I have only invited 7). I also told her that it was fine by me if he came but that I just don’t have room and she was cool, but I lied to her and she’s a good friend. 

This guy is older than her and they used to date when she was in high school. He was like 24 and she was like 16. Should I tell her the truth? This isn’t the only time I’ve lied to her about bringing this guy AITA?

Edit: I get why everyone is saying AITA because I’ve lied  but this isn’t the first time her asking if the guy can come around. We’ve expressed our concerns as a friend group before that we don’t really like him, and she still wants to keep him around. It’s so sad because she’s the sweetest thing I just think that he really did a number on her when she was still in high school."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c25xwb	2019-06-18 18:32:23	N0smas	AITA for only sending a card for Father's Day?	"So I had a particularly busy week leading up to Father's Day and it totally slipped my mind that it was approaching. My dad lives in another province so anything I get him has to be ordered or mailed several days to a week in advance. Normally it's a card plus a gift card or something delivered online, but neither of us are big gift givers. This time I just sent a card and signed it and mailed it right away. No gift card or anything. 

&#x200B;

When I called him on Father's Day we had our usual 30-45 minute chat and he brought up that there was nothing but a card in the envelope I sent. It was in a sort of joking but not really kind of way and I felt kind of bad. Now I would like to think I'm not really a cheap asshole. He had a stop over flight in my city a couple of weeks ago and I paid for supper for all of us despite him wanting to pay. I guess this is a pretty small thing as far as some AITA questions go but I really don't know what the consensus would be here."	No A-holes here	0	0

c25vv9	2019-06-18 18:27:59	deadliftsntacos	AITA for hating a gift?	"So I’ve (35F) been seeing my SO (30M) for a little over a year and a half.  Saturday was my birthday and we were supposed to go out to a low key dinner together that evening. Somehow his parents ended up coming along (I always enjoy their company) and they paid the bill, which was very sweet, but I just wanted to go out with him.

When he gave me my gift it was wrapped in his traditional newspaper wrapping (my favorite). It was a knife with a sheath.

I guess I should say that I’ve been into knives lately, however, I carry two smaller knives that I’ve bought for myself (Kershaw and Wilson Combat) over the last few months. 

This knife was not a style I would gravitate to (it’s a large fixed blade), nor was it a color I like (wrapped in black and white paracord). Honestly, it seemed like something he would buy himself, so I asked if there was a story behind this knife (hoping there might have been a reason why he’s giving me a large knife I could never possibly use).

“Some guy from Etsy made it.”

Oh. 

“Also I thought you could use it when you go camping.”

I’ve never camped a day in my life - he knows this. 

Later he asked if I liked it, I told him that it was the thought that counted but I could see he was hurt. He said he was sorry that he let me down and that would get me something else. I told him that I didn’t want him to spend anymore money.

In the past he has been very thoughtful about the gifts he gives, including a very nice necklace he brought back from a trip abroad. Which was a complete surprise. I adore it and  try to wear it as often as possible. 

I always try to give meaningful gifts to the people I care about and I’ve always been grateful for what I receive (I don’t want things to begin with since I can buy them myself). I’ve extended the same courtesy when it comes to him, he can buy anything he likes (and does so), but I make sure that I find something he wants, needs, or that I know he would love to add to his collection. He’s even gone so far to tell me I’ve given some of the best gifts he’s received.

I’m feeling hurt because this seems thoughtless, and now feel like garbage because I’ve hurt his feelings.

c25tv6	2019-06-18 18:23:40	shipw	AITA for essentially calling my dad cheap?	"This honestly isn't a big deal, I'm just curious.

I'm in town visiting my parents for a few weeks (I live abroad). 

My dad received some sort of free coupon book for his birthday (I guess it came in the mail from some advertising company? Not sure, but he didn't pay for it).

One of the coupons was for a free bundt cake from a nearby shop. He went there and got the free one and also purchased a 2nd one for about 4 bucks. 

He was talking to me and my mom about dinner plans and mentioned about going back to get another free bundt cake. I asked him, ""but didn't you already use the coupon?""

and he said: ""yeah but the coupon was on my phone and they didn't scan it and barely even looked at it. I bet I could use it again, I'll just have mom go in this time""

I told him that was not right, it's a little local business, you shouldn't take advantage of them, etc.

He told me it was no big deal. Even my MOM (who is the most honest and ethical person I know) agreed with him and said it was fine, relax, etc.

I stood my ground and told them ""it's not like it's some huge chain that wouldn't even notice, it's a little local shop that relies on each sale! I can't believe you are thinking about doing that!""

Then my dad said ""I'll just get a free one and also buy one! That way they still make a profit!"" 

I said ""they give away the free one on your birthday to entice you to purchase one some other time, not for you to scam them and get unlimited free ones!""

Anyway, I guess he decided not to do it because I was so annoying about the whole thing.

I guess it bothers me so much because my dad is WEALTHY. They live in a giant house in the suburbs, drive nice cars, are both retired, and can afford to spend 4 bucks on a cake. 

Am I the asshole for basically calling my dad cheap and being obnoxious? Or is he the asshole for trying to scam 4 bucks?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c25tqf	2019-06-18 18:23:24	badpaolita	WIBTA if I take out my classmate’s name out of group project’s paper even tho if she’s sick?	"Background: we got this philosophy project two weeks ago -group of 5- and just last week everyone of us picked their part, except for this one girl Cici. We all agreed i was the one to receive the information and just unify everything along with the PowerPoint presentation. 

Now to the issue: A couple of days ago, Cici decided to text in the group chat saying she didn’t know her part and then tried to use mine as I told her flat NO cause If she wanted it she should have said it the same day we were picking and I already did all my written part and so. She didn’t say anything else until yesterday that I reminded her, what everybody’s part was and what was left for her. She said ok. 
Yesterday i received my other classmates, parts and I reminder in the group chat that the project is due today and it most be printed early. This girl Cici, she texted and said that she was sick and she was buying medicine, nothing about if she’s doing anything for the project or if she’s even going to assist class tonight. 
To be real honest, i really like her, but I don’t have the time or energy to be doing her part of the job. I told my other peer that if she doesn’t present anything, i will take her name out of the paper.  
What do you think?

Tl;dr classmate doesn’t do her part of the job due to sickness but won’t take responsibility for that either.  I don’t want to put her name in our project if she doesn’t do anything"	Not enough info	0	0

c25r5e	2019-06-18 18:17:56	ZubenelJanubi	WIBTA If I put my dog to sleep when my family goes on vacation?	"Our dog, who is a pug and is 12 years old, was diagnosed with a malignant sarcoma on his upper gum about 5 months ago. We visited 5 vets; all have told us that while they can perform surgery and de-bulk the tumor, the tumor will grow back. Chemo is around $450 a month, FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. Surgery would be $1500 - $4500. Every vet has strongly suggested that we humanely euthanize him sooner than later. We reached out to a traveling vet that euthanizes pets at home. He specifically told us that we should think about our dog’s quality of life and to also think about the mental anguish that he will specifically face when he euthanizes a dog in agonizing pain.

With all that being said, we started giving him RSO, THC and CBD versions along with gabapentin, tramadol, and prednisone. One of the cannabis products we give him is CBD companion, which is bacon flavored CBD oil that comes with an eye dropper. The vet has also been gracious to give us 90 day supplies of medications.

My wife and I agreed that our dog would let us know when it was time for him to pass. Before his diagnoses, we planned to visit family out of country, me for 2 weeks and her for 2 months with the kids. I cancelled my trip to take care of our dog at the request of her a month or so after his diagnoses. Everything was going well, until about a month ago.

He stopped taking his pill pockets with his medicine and all but refused to eat. He is constantly panting from pain and does not lie down except when he is exhausted from standing all day due to the pain. He can barely walk up the stairs, and if I try to pick him up he yelps in pain. He has lost a lot of weight. The smell alone from the necrotic flesh is nauseating and it is everywhere in the house, Febreeze only works so much. The carpet continually has new stains where he finally lays down that I clean up.

My wife insisted that we continue to give him his medication, so I started compounding his medication with the bacon oil. That's right, I crush his prednisone pill up, empty the gabapentin capsule, add 3 drops of RSO (I combined the CBD and THC RSO's), with .75 ml of bacon CBD oil. I mix it up together, and then suck it all up in the eye dropper. We then squirt the medicine in his mouth and make him swallow it. We do not give Tramadol this way.

They leave to visit family in less than two weeks. I have tried talking with her about euthanizing him before they go, to let her say good bye, but she refuses. She fully expects him to be alive when they return in August with visiting family. She continually tells me that I am being negative and that if I was more positive that he would feel that and get better, she has specifically said that she is hoping for a miracle.

I wanted to say good bye 4 months ago, when he could still go to the dog park, when he could still eat a meal without being in tremendous pain, when he could sleep through the night. WIBTA if I put my dog to sleep soon after they go on vacation?

Edit: Today as a family we walked him down the Rainbow Bridge. Thank you to all for your advice, both good and bad. Even in insult I found insight and I sincerely appreciate that."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c25qys	2019-06-18 18:17:32	xxKRAZNxx	AITA for snapping at my girlfriend's mother?	"So for background on the argument my girlfriend and I have been together for 6 and a half years. The relationship between her parents and I started off a little rocky when they caught us hooking up in their house when they were gone. However, around six years later, we have since then smoothed most things out and they have accepted me in. 

My girlfriend and I have also recently got a new puppy and we are still in the process of training him. One of the things we have been trying to enforce is not get him into the habit of begging for food when we have some with us. We have been told by multiple trainers to just ignore him and not give him anything. However, while we have been staying at her parents house visiting before we move out of the state, my girlfriends mother has repeatedly given him food and ignored our requests that she not do that anymore. Today she has done it twice and the second time I snapped and yelled from across the house ""Stopping giving him food ""her name"" and don't act like a child about it either"". (She has stuck her nose in the opposite direction and pretended that she didn't do anything when we have blatantly seen her do it).

 A minute or two later she pulls the two of us aside and tries to lecture us on dogs and how she thinks that all dogs beg and that some dogs are more aggressive in looking for food and ours is just like that. I tried to reinforce my point in saying that all we ask is that she respect our rules with our dog. She then leaves into her room after making it very clear she is not a child. 

My girlfriend then becomes mad at me for snapping at her mother and thinks that it could ruin the entire relationship we have tried to build back up. I understand her point but I don't personally see any other way of confronting her that would have made it stick in her head. My girlfriend has refused to talk to me since this happened a few hours ago. I also attempted to try and apologize for being so ""hostile"" as I put it with her mother saying it was alright in a very passive aggressive tone. Things are still attempting to be smoothed out since then but nothing has happened so far.

c25pev	2019-06-18 18:14:04	romanimthegloman	AITA for still being angry with my dad about him thinking I was a hypochondriac then changing his mind after one of his friends had the same symptoms.	"(Throwaway account) I’m 34f, a bit old for this petty nonsense but it’s still burns. So I have been chronically unwell with CFS for about 15 years. I managed to keep a normal lifestyle and not complain to anyone much about it when I was younger, but the last five years I’ve been very unwell and it all came tumbling down on me.  Can’t work anymore.
My dad and brother have been living in the other side of the world for years and haven’t seen me. Over those years every time my dad called and asked me how I was and I’d say I wasn’t well, he’d say ‘Oh. So how’s the weather?’. That kind of thing. It had always been like that, even mum got it, like if she had a migraine or something he wouldn’t talk to her until it had passed. Zero tolerance for weakness or illness in my house growing up. Unless it was him. 
Dad and bro knew I hadn’t worked in a while and bro emailed to say they he and dad had discussed me and decided to offer to send me to a therapist for my hypochondria. I was angry of course because my mother and I had explained to him several times over the years that I had CFS. I decided to agree to the therapy as I thought ‘fuck it, I could use some therapy for my actual problems and they won’t believe me if I tell them I don’t have hypochondria anyway’. Two days later the offer was off the table, he suddenly couldn’t afford it.
Fast forward five years to today and my dad emails me to say that his friend (a guy) had CFS and is going to email me to give me advice and now he’s emailing me about this guy and asking me if I’ve emailed him and telling me all about the things this guy did to cure his CFS and so on. 
I get that maybe he needed to hear the CFS story from a man in order understand that it’s not a ‘crazy woman’ thing. But I still don’t feel like he gets to decide when he believes that I’m telling the truth because he respects men’s opinions more than women’s.

Long story short, my son, the 5 year old referenced in the title, started a chain reaction that would ultimately get my dog hit by a car. Before the incident occurred my son left a door open causing my ten year old lab to be able to run towards me (his best buddy), where I was standing across the street talking with a friend. Upon seeing this I quickly/carefully picked him up and rushed him to the ER.

Without going too much into detail about my finances, just know my wife is a stay at home wife and we have roughly $200 (depending on the available hours/OT) after our bills are paid for. My son, feeling guilty for leaving the door open (despite my wife and I's reassurances that it wasn't his fault and we still love him) offered up his college savings to help cover the medical costs. This totals to about $2,500 and would cover 50% of his treatment. Am I an asshole for wanting to accept this? My dog suffers from a broken leg. The ER visit alone was $2,000. The surgery is going to be anywhere from $2,500 - $4,000. This dog was with me during my time in the military and will be with me as long as I can ensure he is comfortable. He's my best bud so putting him down isn't an option.

She went back to Uni after that and we agreed to keep talking, I was very much hoping to get back together once she finished uni for the summer.

After an argument we stopped talking and it became a text or two a week before no contact.
It had been 3 weeks since we last text, and I recently decided to go to Uni myself so I thought it was only fair to tell her this so I invited her for a coffee, after seeing her for the first time in 2 months my emotions were all over the place. I had just started to get over her so it was difficult but I tried to play it cool. We ended up kissing in her car before she went to work and agreed to meet after her shift finished.

We met up around midnight and we ended up doing it in her car that night. We agreed to keep hooking up but nothing more as we both know it’s not what we really want. Yesterday we slept together again and afterwards she got emotional and said that she still loved me.

We have a plan to meet in 2 days, but knowing that she still has these feelings, my thought is it’s best if I don’t show up and text her it’s over before things go too far and she gets really hurt.
AITA because I suggested the coffee, and made the first move and initiated the friends with benefits scenario and now ditching her? I just don’t want to see her get hurt any more than she already is and we are lying to people we care about just to keep this a secret. And the only way we both started to get better was when we cut each other off and I feel it’s the only solution as if we stay friends we will keep hooking up."	Asshole	1	0

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I was a sophomore in high school, I really wanted a ball python. It took a lot to convince my parents, especially my mom, but after a couple months I got one. Admittedly, I kind of rushed into the adoption. Looking back I should've listened to those who said not to get a ball python as a teen, and to wait until after college.

&#x200B;

At the time, I was battling depression. I sort of thought that this would fix things because something would be dependent on me. Don't get me wrong, this is obviously terrible logic, but I also loved him and still do. Now I am much better, but I have less and less time with my snake and more and more responsibility of my own.

&#x200B;

I won't be able to care for him next year and have no idea when I will be able to in the future. My dad has said he'll take care of him and I can visit whenever I want, but I know he definitely won't get the attention he deserves. My mom still won't touch or go near him.

Am I the asshole for having reservations on letting her get it?

A lot of the time she'll turn things back on her and say shit like ""you never think about my feelings"" and ""you never worry about me"". I can't really control my emotions, which my mum should know especially since my happiness fluctuates a lot and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A lot of things I say are in the heat of the moment and I always apologise afterwards if I say something hurtful, which I usually don't because I'm pretty scared of her ngl. The thing is, she never apologises for saying hurtful things to me but I always apologise for doing things wrong. She's said stuff like ""you're an embarrassment to this family"" and ""I'm going to send you somewhere else, I can't deal with this anymore"" and yet she never thinks about how her words affect me. The meanest thing I've said to her is ""I hate you"", which I did end up apologising about. Every time we argue and she shouts at me, I shout back and stand up for myself, to which she responds with ""don't you dare raise your voice at me"" most of the time. Am I an asshole for shouting at her? I understand that she does a lot for me (feeds me, makes sure I have clean water everyday, etc) but I really just can't control my anger and I'm not just going to stand there and let her shout and swear at me. I get angry about a lot of things and tbh that runs in the family, my whole family gets angry over the smallest of things yet they're all so blind to it. I'm grateful that she doesn't hurt me anymore but I'd really like if she was just calmer about things and actually took into account my feelings"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c25gh8	2019-06-18 17:55:14	WaterMelonMan69-420	AITA for secretly hating our fosterchild?	"Long time lurker, first time poster. English is not my first language, so please read through my spelling mistakes. First off, ""hating"" is a strong word, I just couldn’t think of any other word to describe it.

When I was 15 we got a deal with a family to take care of a kid once a week till the kid turns 18, or our service isn't needed anymore. Let's call him Ryan. Now, before that deal came in place, my family discussed what my little sister and I thought about it.

At first I thought it would be a great thing to do for the family, since the kid has various of diagnoses (ADHD, Autism among other) which means he can’t sit still, and always has to be active, screaming or hitting stuff. The family also have another kid a few years older (Both kids under the age of 10 at this point) One needs everything to go slow, needs to know what's happening all the time, and everything has to go according to the plan he was given earlier that morning.

Ryan is the complete opposite.

When the deal came in place, it started out alright. Once a week my parents would pick him up from kindergarten, drive him home to us, eat dinner, sleep, then my parents would take him to kindergarten again the next day.

But as I grew up (I’m now 18, and Ryan is 10) Ryan started to annoy me. The way he would always hit my parents, cry when he didn’t get what he wanted, go after our dog because he doesn’t like dogs etc. He screams, or talks very loud at all time, and hits things or people to get off with his energy.

It just haven’t gotten any better for me. I haven’t discussed this with anyone, as I’m afraid my parents will be angry with me for saying how I feel about him. I know it’s for the best, and we've really helped this family getting some time off with him.

I just can’t stand being around him.

He's got medication, but only gets it when he goes to school (as he is now old enough to join the school) so he can focus better and let the other kids be.

I try to lock myself in my room when he's here to get some alone time, but my parents want me to help taking care of him while they prepare food and what not. So ""escaping"" is not an option for me.

I can’t decide if I’m the asshole for feeling this way, when it's of course due to his diagnoses and he can’t do anything about it.

I just can’t stand being around him, gets angry when he interrupts while I talk to my parents, and when I come home from a long day at work, all I want to do is just relax, and spend time with my family. And he just ruins all that for me. Since I’ve now gotten 18, and have a car myself, I now sometimes pick him up from school and takes him home to us, so I’ve just gotten more and more involved when I got older.

AITA for feeling this way about Ryan, and really don’t want anything to do with him? And should I speak with my parents about how I feel, despite the fact that they might get angry with me for not wanting to help him and/or be around him?

EDIT: Thank you so much for the silver!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE: 

&#x200B;

So i spoke with my parents.

Sorry for late respons, we had Ryan yesterday and i didn't feel like writing this out with my parents and Ryan nearby.

We came to an agreement. I told them how i felt about Ryan, and what i liked and didn't like about having him around. They had (as expected) thought everything was cool, and therefore had me help with stuff.

i proposed the idea that i'd happily cook the food, or do the cleaning if they looked after him. So we actually switch roles a bit.

Then we agreed that if i went to my room, and locked the door, it was a sign of me having enough for now, and to leave me be. So all in all a great agreement. I'm still looking to move out some time soon though."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c25fzf	2019-06-18 17:54:07	EnvironmentalTable1	WIBTA if I protest against our families inheritance plans?	"\*\*Warning: A lot of backstory coming up:\*\*We are a family of 4 by now. Around 3 years ago my dad died and has left quite a bit of inheritance money + estates. We are currently working out how to split up said inheritance. Involved in this situation are:

1. My mom (50s) who has found a new boyfriend (who has his own quite successful business) and still has savings of around 400.000€ all by herself. She won't get any retirement pension so she'll have to get by with her own savings. She'll retire this winter.
2. My oldest brother (early 30s), married, has 2 children and has a VERY well paying job. His wife is unemployed and cares for the children. I don't know his savings.
3. My middle brother (late 20s), single and had a brain tumor about 4 years ago but has been cured of it around 2 years ago. Due to his medical history he's unable to get a job and gets state pensions for life (although the amount gets re-evaluated every couple of years and may be a bit too little to simply life of off). He has around 20.000€ in savings.
4. Me (\~20) just started my career in decent paying position. I'm in a relationship and plan to move to her place in around half a year, making me unemployed at least for a little while until I get a new job.The entire inheritance will be about 500.000€, one estate (estate A), meant for 1 family, worth around 350.000€ - 400.000€ if sold directly and one estate (estate B), containing 3 apartments,  worth maybe 250.000€.

\*\*About the inheritance plan:\*\*My oldest brother will get estate A while having to pay me 100.000€ in rates over the next 15 years.

I'll get the aformentioned 100.000€ plus 75.000€ directly.

My middle brother get's the right to live in the current apartment, inside estate B, forever.This will add up to my own inheritance of 175.000€ total in about 15 years.

My mom gets estate B and all rent payments from it.

The rest of the inheritance (\~425.000€) will go into an ""emergency fund"" where each one of us will have full access to.This emergency money is supposed to be used for someone being in a tight spot financially or if someone has to do repairs on of the estates.

\*\*The real AITA part:\*\*I think the emergency fund is kind of unfairly set up. My mom, oldest brother and middle brother are all more likely to get to use the emergency fund than I am since I am the only one being in a quite stable financial position while not having my own house to take care of. I acknowledge that especially my middle brother will probably need some from of (financial) support but this inheritance plan could leave him with gaining up to 600.000€ (if he lives to around 80 yo) in saved rent + emergency payments.

&#x200B;

Please consider my family members situations when passings judgement on me.

&#x200B;

Since people keep asking:

**Edit 1:**

* My father didnt specify any inheritance plan.
* When he died my oldest brother didn't have children.
* When he died my middle brother was completely healthy.
* I was in Highschool and didn't know where life would lead me.  


**Edit 2:**

Legally I am entitled to at least 1/6 of the inheritance. It gets complicated by the fact that my mom doesn't have any legal rights to estate A even though she morally should have."	No A-holes here	0	0
c25fdp	2019-06-18 17:52:46		AITA For Lashing At Friend?	"Quick info I'm in Grade 11, in a country where people MUST go to private tutors for most subjects. It is  rite of passage for many, Also,in my school,most people bring their own food, but head over to the canteen to purchase food if they wish


I was heading over to the school's store,to purchase a new textbook since I lost my last. He then asked me whether I would be able to purchase one for his tuition teacher who needs one. I decline. This question is asked twice, twice I decline, as the store operators often question if you buy a book twice. If I were to purchase in his name, I would  require his ID number. Either way, Its heading over to my receipt,& my mom will  likely bust my ass for spending money on others.


I don't know why it didn't occur to me, but I didn't state that reason,but said I didn't have money on me. The book is roughly 3$ & I had about 15$ saved up from 6 months prior(I dont make a ton of pocket money). He then states that he would return the book cost,doubled . I  again decline as I'm paranoid about just giving  things in general, even if  it would be returned.



I sit down to apply the name sticker on the book, so i dont lose it.He tries to irritate me by constantly shoving a sheet  at my hands trying to mess up what I was doing. I got pissed at this point & asked him why the hell he didnt use his own money today if he kept buying food for 4-5$ twice everyday. I guess I shouldn't have done that,because he took that as a personal insult. Our mutual friend rushes to his rescue, & asks to hear my side of the story. Before I even say half my story, he just ignores me as the other friend speaks & he says his side of the story. They both claim I'm at fault because he ""would've returned the money anyway"".



FYI, I had sent a worksheet which he was missing yesterday after receiving scans of it from a classmate & editing it to remove issues.If he didn't submit it today, he would've lost 2.5% of his mark from an exam paper he had just written. I had asked him to print it, & click a pic so I could see if it was clear enough to send to the entire class.



This was a day before the incident.



He then cites the printing incident today to claim that he was willing to do favors for me( It was for him & the class Printing also isn't 3$) & claims that I should have returned the favor& that I shouted at him for buying food because im a jealous vegetarian (?) & that I should've given money . Later that day, when he needed help with something and I helped, he told me that he didn't need my help & brushed me off.


Fyi,this guy tore a piece of burger the day before & threw it at my face for fun just to see me offended because Im a vegetarian & germaphobic. He didnt provide an apology for that or for all the shit he has pulled off before.I  brush it off whenever such shit is pulled, yet he gives me the cold shoulder for lashing out at him once?. Honestly,Im conflicted as to whether I should make up for it & apologize to himor not"		1	0

c25dec	2019-06-18 17:48:23		AITA for not getting my dad a father’s day gift?	Disclaimer: me and my dad are super close and we have a great relationship so nothing is out of hatred or spite. My Dads birthday is a week after father’s day, and he asked that we not get him any gifts for father’s day and just celebrate both bigger on his birthday. We are a relatively privileged family- decently middle class and so usually my dad is able to buy everything he would want for himself. This makes it pretty hard to shop for him as his kids who don’t have a lot of money ourselves  (yes I know personalized thoughtful gifts but i’ve done so many in the past my creativity has kind of burnt out), but he also understands that this makes it difficult for us as well  which is another reason why he asked us not to. Seems pretty fair and understandable. But come father’s day my mom got him a gift and is yelling at all of us because “just because someone says they don’t want a gift doesn’t mean you don’t get him something I guess you don’t appreciate your father”. I got him a funny card and signed it and plan on getting him something great for his birthday- I just want to know If my mom is right AITA for not getting my dad something on both occasions?

c25cms	2019-06-18 17:46:38		AITA For complaining about working with my dad	"So this post is a bit of a validation one, but I'm expecting a lot of ESHs as well.

So some context: I'm 16 and just finished my GCSEs and have done well in them. My brother just finished college and came out with good grades (UK college if that makes a difference). He is 18. We were meant to go for a celebratory meal today.

So the first thing I'm greeted to after finishing my GCSEs, as so my brother, is a week straight of working for my dad. Its menial labour, like putting up fences and stuff, he shouts at us all the time, and it is generally some of the worst stuff to be doing, I'd rather be still sitting my exams.

I was okay with, and expected to, help out around the house as well as doing the odd job over the holiday. I also expected to get a job, the money for which wouldn't all go to me, but also help the rest of the family. This week of work is now on top of what I expected.

To top this off, the celebratory meal, which was literally just a Burger King, was called off today because my dad complained about it preventing us from working. Needless to say, this pissed off me and my brother. I also was meant to go into school to return my books.

My mum decides last minute that we will return my books and go to Burger King but I'm already mad as this point as both me and my brother have kinda been treated like shit.

So on the car journey to school I complain to my mum about the work load. This escalates - fast.

In the end, she calls me lazy, I say she does nothing as well, she says she regrets having me.

You read that right. In my opinion, that completely overstepped the line.

I tell my dad and brother. My dad responds by calling me a fucking idiot. My brother laughs and says he always told me (it was in a joking way, he's generally a bit of a dick like that). I walk off and my dad shouts after me expecting me to continue helping him - I ignore him.

I just clear my head in my room before later confronting my mum. In this I try to act mature. I apologise firstly, saying I didn't mean what I said (which is true) and that I can deal with helping my dad for a week. I then say that we still have to talk about what she said, as it overstepped the line. She refuses to apologise, but after me talking to her a second time, gives me a half-arsed apology. My dad continues to shout at everyone over dinner.

So, although I can expect the answer, AITA, or should I have just shut up and not complained about the work?

Some backstory: I’m a (16M) who just finished junior year, parents and I are Arabic. The country in question is Syria. We live in the US.

Last summer break I went to Syria with my older brother and parents and it was completely  dreadful. There really wasn’t much to do other than play cards and walk around the city with friends which was fun for about a week. And then we got tired of it. There’s a shit ton of blood sucking flies, the power goes out about every 3 hrs (including the WiFi which is crap anyways), and I was scared to eat the food because i got sick the first week there. Not to mention there’s literally no laws, there’s kids on motorcycles, kids drinking and smoking and no speed limit 

Fast forward to next summer and my parents drop the bomb and tell me we’re going to go back for the summer without my brother because in Syria there’s a law that guys 18 or older have to get into the Syrian military or they have to pay a decent sum of money to be excused. 

I told him there’s no way I’m going back esspesially without my brother. and he flips his shit and says how I’m being a ungrateful little shit. The next few days is just constant arguing between both my parents and me They ‘re argument is that I’m soon going to be 18 and won’t be able to see family there because of the military law. (Unless I or they pay it). My side being all the flaws of the country I stated already, and the fact that my brother and almost all of my close friends aren’t going this year (we all went last year) I just don’t want to be stuck in a really underdeveloped country with very few friends and my brother not being there either, Tell me reddit AITA?"

c25bnz	2019-06-18 17:44:25	supergirlspanties	AITA for canceling my electrolysis appointments	"Plain and simple: I have a huge aversion to smokers. I grew up with my mom and dad as smokers, and as I've grown up I watched all my friends become smokers. I can't stand the smell, and even seeing just a cigarette grosses me out.

I signed up to get electrolysis done on my face with a new clinic I've never visited before. I never really know what I'm getting with electrolysis because it always seems like just anyone can set up a machine in a tiny space and do it. That's no problem, and power to anyone with the ability to create a livelihood from it, but it also opens up many avenues that things like, dentists, wouldn't be able to do.

So I went in for a first appointment and they signed me up for a full course - 7 or 8 weeks of electrolysis at an hour a week. We went through the whole process, and periodically the esthetician would get up and say they were doing ""cancer research"" with their SO, who was the intake person. They'd leave for a few minutes and come back. I knew what it meant, I'm not that stupid. It was clear she was washing her hands and putting on gloves and then a strong smelling lotion to cover it up. It grossed me out. She was close to my face and I just wanted to barf. I left, and had to think. I don't live in an area where I can get another esthetician quickly or close by, so I'm limited. 

I decided to cancel my next appointment, and all the appointments thereafter. I told her on the phone I thought it was unprofessional to smoke during the process, and they doubled down to say every precaution was taken to be sterile. I think that bothered me the most. They accosted me for taking up their schedule space and they told me that there were many others dying to get their services and I was lucky I even got in in the first place. They said based on the things we talked about during the service, I should be understanding about addiction. That bothered me too, considering I've never been an addict, but my dad was.

AITA for telling them that's why I canceled? Should I have just said nothing? I gave them a bad review on Facebook and they messaged me to say they're blacklisting me from any of their colleague's businesses. I feel like a jerk, like I insulted them.

Then ten minutes before the date he messages me saying sorry he forgot he had another class that was starting soon and he couldn't make it.

I don't like my time being wasted"" then unmatched him (he will still see the message). 

I'm trying to learn to have more boundaries because I can be too much of a people-pleaser and I can have unhealthy taste in men and I don't want to date someone who can't show me basic courtesy, but did I go too far in the opposite direction and be overly cold and judgemental?

c25ao3	2019-06-18 17:42:17	goodred295	AITA For Taking Back My Mug from a Coworker	"I (32m) work in an office with a communal kitchen like most offices. In the kitchen there are communal bowls, mugs (branded with company info) plates, silverware, etc. In addition to the communal mugs many people also bring in their own personal mugs for use. It is balntely obvious what mugs are communal and which are someones personal mug. For example, one of my co-workers went to Harvard so it is known around the office he uses his Harvard mug daily for coffee. It is not the kind of office environment where everyone shares everything, i.e- I wouldn't use this coworkers Harvard mug.

In my role at the office I am in charge of loading, running and unloading the dishwasher. I have my own personal mug that I bring in and use everyday. Not that is matters, but I feel it's worth noting it is a very nice Starbucks limited edition travel coffee mug with a distinctive design. Anyway, since I am the one who loads and unloads the dishwasher, every few days I will run my mug through the dishwasher. Since I am the one un-loading it I feel comfortable putting my mug in it since I will be there to grab it when it's clean and take it to my desk.

Today someone else unloaded the dishwasher so I didn't immieditly grab my mug. About 30 mins into work I was walking though the office and noticed my mug on a coworkers desk. This caught me off guard. It felt like such an intrusion. In my opinion, it's an unspoken rule that you don't use another persons mug that they use *everyday* esspecially when our office supplies communal mugs. I'm a bit of a germaphobe and admittedly possessive of my things (especially sharing a cup with someone I barely know) so as I went through my morning this kept bothering me and I hated the feeling of someone using my mug.

I noticed my coworker wasn't at their desk and as I was walking by I simply grabbed my mug from their desk, rinsed it and put it in my purse to take home. I understand this is passive aggressive and maybe an over reaction but I feel entitled to take something that is *mine.* Some of my friends are saying I was over reacting while others agree it's an invasion into personal boundaries. So am I the asshole for taking back what is mine?

c25al1	2019-06-18 17:42:05	zombieangel1	AITA for not liking someone else's friend?	"A bit of backstory:

I'm a 16 year old girl suffering with a mental disorder that nearly everyone (teacher) at my now old school thinks I have, so we've gotten myself tested and are still waiting for the results.

Also my ex-friend was aware of my potential on having a mental disorder.

My now ex-friend was two years younger than me and she's actually transgender, now a guy.

I had a bit of a crush on him and we went out, then he dumped me for another girl and haven't talked for a few months. Then we reconnected and he told me he was gay, I a bit unhappy by the news sucked it up and wanted to continue as friends.

It's now been over half a year and everything was great, the only problem was that because of my feelings apparently I came across to him as being a bit flirty but I tried to fight the urges since he was my crush. I still tried to make things work.

Then May 26 this year I started to text him because he walked underneath my window with one of his girl friends, we'll call Meanie.

Meanie was the same girl that he dumped me for nearly a year ago at this point and I never really liked her, I don't know why but I just didn't. I remember that the first time I met Meanie that she said something rude to me, can't actually remember exactly what they said but they said something really rude for me to feel uncomfortable around her.

Anyway my ex-friend got onto the exact subject about Meanie and I explained that I can't remember what she exactly said, so he called me. Being really stressed by how he was acting I said I couldn't remember, passing the phone to Meanie who shouted down at me. Being very aggressive.

Then she hanged up and I apologized to ex-friend on how I was acting, then they just threw everything at me in text. Picking on me for the tiniest bits of details and the flirting thing from earlier. Being very aggressive and abusive.

I had to block their phone number because of how horrible they were being, I was all in tears crying on my floor. This person was a person I really trusted but they broke me, really badly.

When I got back to school they never approached me, my mum says they're not going to do anything because they're the type of person to hide behind a screen and won't have the balls to actually say it to my face.

Last year, I had a class where we've to produce a video documentary . It's a pretty big project that has a lot of effects on our grades. The professor asked to form a group of 6 or 7(The details kinda foggy to me). After, Me and my other friends already formed a group, there's a 2 guys whom everyone didn't want to be in their teams. I heard that these two are notorious for not working and isolating themselves from other people. To be fair, I've never be in the same group as them and wanted to give them a benefit of the doubt. (We went to camp trip together, so I kinda on the friendly terms with one of them.)

I kinda pity them and take them into the fold.(I asked my teammate first, of course.) They said they it's fine, so I took them in.

Oh boy, They did live up to their reputations. These two didn't even try to participate in group discussion during class. All they did is talking to each other or playing games. I tried to ask them for an opinion or what they want to do about our video or class works. They said everything is fine and we can do whatever we want. Which is pretty frustrating to be honest.

Now,  we formed a group chat where members can regulate and update on the mid-term video documentary. These two joined but stayed silent. They didn't ask if there's anything they can do or help. These two was dead silent throughout the matter.(Both of them claimed that they didn't see the notifications.)

That was the last straw, we set a poll to decide if we will keep them within the group but put (Didn't do anything) next to their names when the credit rolls, or pulled their name out. We decided to take their name off instead. Then I decided to tell these two myself, because I took them in, I'll be the one who kick them out. We kinda leave them to fend for themselves.

c258l3	2019-06-18 17:37:47		AITA for ignoring my stressed husband?	"Just to give perspective, my husbands a sweet guy who hates upsetting people, we don’t fight often at all and have a good relationship.

When he gets angry at me for something, he won’t come right out and say it; he can be very passive aggressive and hinty and will continually tell me he “doesn’t know why he’s stressed” and that it “has nothing to do with me,” and then at the end of the day admit what was actually wrong. 

I’ll give an example of Mother’s Day as this is what usually happens; we have two kittens and he was making breakfast for me early when me and the kids woke up. He had left a plate of food at the table and one of the cats got into it, so he flipped out screaming and swearing at the cat and started slamming things around the kitchen after that (when he had to take pans out, he’d slam them onto the stove, things like that.) The whole situation annoyed the hell out of me because 1)loud noises and swearing makes me anxious af, it makes me jump when I hear a door slam or a dish get slammed into the counter and 2)this has happened other times, so I said, “why don’t you just put the food in the fridge so the cats stop getting to it?” He said, “yup” and continued on making food. After a few hours I forgot all about the situation with the cat, but I noticed he was being very short with me and slamming things around, and overall avoiding me. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing, but the rest of the afternoon this continued. I was really upset because it was Mother’s Day and I didn’t understand why he was being so cold to me. I asked him a few more times throughout the day what was wrong and got the same “nothing, I’m fine, nothings wrong” so finally I told him I could tell and that all I wanted was to spend time with him since it was Mother’s Day. At this point it was 7 at night and he finally told me what he was mad about all day; me telling him to keep the food in the fridge instead of out. It was very frustrating and could’ve been addressed earlier.

So today I’m working and I texted him to ask how work was, like we always do. I got texts saying that he’s stressed and sick of “twisted life” but when asked he has no idea what he’s stressed about. It makes no sense and I’ve seen this pattern, but this time I left it at that and told him I’m sorry and hope he feels better. Ever since, I’ve been getting texts saying the same thing, “I’m so sick of feeling stressed” “I feel sick and annoyed” etc. I haven’t said anything else because I don’t feel like I have to anymore. When he’s stressed, I’m stressed and I don’t think it’s fair that I have to pull it out of him, so I plan on just accepting that he “doesn’t know.” I’ve told him before it’s hard for me when he doesn’t tell me why he’s upset because I can’t help/change what I’m doing if I have no idea, and the whole thing is childish and makes me feel like shit. I can’t help but feel guilty knowing somethings wrong and just pushing it to the side like that.

c258iq	2019-06-18 17:37:38	learningthrowaway425	AITA for standing up to my roommate?	"6 years ago I moved in with a friend from college. I worked night shift, didn't see her much. 

She left filthy plates and clothes everywhere. She had guests stay in our living room without asking. I’d get home at 4am and surprise! Someone asleep on the couch. I talked to her about this but every time she would get defensive and refuse to admit wrongdoing. Any time I asked to have guests stay, she would say it was a huge inconvenience for her. I moved out on good terms. 

Fast forward a year and she's dating one of my new roommates. She calls and says she’s going to move into our spare room and we would be roommates again! I protest to my current roommate, who said I was being a bad friend to her. She moves in only for “one year”.

“One year"" is now going on three. She just finally paid me two years of not paying the utility bill, during which time she's lived well.  Her trend of having surprise guests has continued. Frequently we are informed only a week or so in advance. I gave up trying to talk to her about this after how difficult it was at the apartment. On the rare occasion that I ask for a guest I'm still met with a complaint about how inconvenient it is. 

She's out of town this summer but will be back one week in July. She’s not paying rent. A relative and I had been trying to work out a visit. Last week he called and said ""I have to book now is this ok?"" I said go for it.

I text my roommates immediately to let them know and she responds ""Oooo, that's the week I'm back. That's literally the only week I'm back this summer. Wish you would have checked with us.""
I lost it. I responded in the group chat that she had never checked with me (which is an exaggeration I admit, but she often doesn't) and her complaint is unfair. She privately messages me that she always checks and it's unfortunate I'm doing this. I respond that she never checks and list off examples. She never responds.

A couple of days later her bf, my other roommate, texts me that I'm crafting a false narrative to make her look bad in the eyes of 4th roommate and that to his knowledge she has always checked before inviting guests. I responded that’s not true. He laughs and asks for evidence. Exactly what evidence am I supposed to have for conversations that never occurred? He calls me a manipulative roommate and tries to make me feel like a bad friend for calling her out the way that I did. In the past I would have caved, not this time. He said it seemed like I was looking to start a fight. I asked why would I do that?

I get the sense they will move out as soon as they can, and I'm sad to think I may have lost one or two ten year plus friendships, but I have so much negativity at her maybe it's for the best. In my eyes she’s a self-centered coward who makes others pay her bills and fight her battles for her. Her smug and condescending approach of ""Oooo, that's the week I'll be back"" pushed me over the edge. Am I the asshole? If I'm wrong I want to know so I c an make it right."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was in the middle of getting my shirt off, when i heard some loud knocks. I ignored it and continued my thing.
After i changed back and got out, that s when she started yelling at me, saying i m an asshole for getting in her fitting room, that i wasn t paying attention to the clothes in there and some other crap i didn t listen to. I , calmly but a bit frustrated, told her that she wasn t entitled to have a fitting room for her when the queues are this big and left.

Edit: The delivery guys came back today and I wanted to update the post. If you didn’t believe the first part of the story, you’re probably not going to believe the rest because it gets even weirder. 

I made sure my husband was home this time so I wouldn’t be here by myself with strange and unpredictable men. When they got here It was the same two guys. Right off the bat my husband said in a light hearted voice and a smile, “Are you going to do another flip in the dining room?”The acrobat’s eyes got big and he slowly shook his head “no”. His partner was eager to share the details of what happened after they left our house the first time. 

They were delivering furniture at a bank. The acrobat put on quite a show in the bank. He did flips and even did a hand stand on a copy machine. The bank manager was not amused and sent the security footage the their boss. The guy was suspended without pay for two weeks. He had just returned to work before making the second delivery to our house."	Asshole	0	0
c25608	2019-06-18 17:32:00	Luminemus	AITA for not thinking that my granny's will to share her legacy is unfair?	"Hey!

So basically my granny dropped a bomb that she would want to leave her apartment to me when she passes away. (3 room apartment in another country) She's not married and has only one child - my mom. Thing is, my dad overheard the conversation and apparently told the whole family. 

(Background info: me F22, and my siblings F27, M18 & F15. F27 has never had good relationship with granny, both are so fiery so they just dont get along. Other two siblings never really wanted to learn the language to be able to communicate thus their relations aren't that special either since they can't really communicate and they have never shown any curiosity to. Obviously granny has favored me, since I'm fluent with the language, I'm not that temperamental and have always cared for her etc.)

So my mom and my brother confronted me and stated that my granny is basically TA. To me she explained her reasons. When my mom was about my age her granny gave her an apartment too. My older sister already has an apartment, so my granny figured she'd like to give me property and thus more stability in life too. And obviously because we have always been closer than she has been with others. When I told them these reasons - which I personally think are alright? They seemed to be very displeased and stated that granny is being extremely unfair towards my other siblings. I also think thar my mom was hurt that granny would want to skip her too (in our laws though she has the right anyway for 50% even if ""skipped"".)

So I'm in a situation I never thought I'd be in. I honestly never even thought about my granny's legacy nor that I would be the one she wants to give it to. I still think though, that it's totally up to her to do what she wishes to do. I feel quite attacked and I'm seriously puzzled. My mom and brother seemed very bitter towards me when I tried to explain grannys words. 

Maybe I can't see this objectively since I'm the one about to get special treatment? 

So help me out here - Is my granny TA for wanting to favor me with her legacy?

c255xq	2019-06-18 17:31:49	TrevorDe	AITA for wanting to come back but changed my mind?	"So I started a new job a month ago and after 2 days their were major red flags. He hadn't put me on a schedule yet and kept just telling me days to come in the day before. Sometimes I would get a random text at 5am asking me to come in.

Asking some of the other employees they said he was terrible as scheduling and working with his employees. So I decided to quit and save myself the headache because I have had bullshit bosses like that before.

 Long story short I texted him asking if I could come back part-time for a little extra pay. He said yes and I planned to come in on the day he told me too and said he would text me when to come in. Never got a call or a text. I text him the next day and no reply. Then I get a call at 9am 2 Days after I was supposed to asking me to come in.

c253kq	2019-06-18 17:26:36	BriefPark	AITA for telling my future BIL exactly what a piece of shit he is, thereby causing him to leave my sister? My family is pissed at me for this	"Basically, a few years ago my sister (26) met my future BIL (25) and they began dating. The family all met him and everyone loved him. He and I clicked and quickly became close friends. Hunting together, he'd help me with my car, I'd help him with projects in his garage, etc. Safe to say we were great friends.

&#x200B;

Well a little under two years ago, FBIL cheats on my sister. She was devastated, obviously, and left his ass. For over four months, my parents and I helped comfort her and support her, but damn she was a wreck. I love my sister and have never seen her so distraught. Obviously, the whole family found out why they broke up, and needless to say everyone hated him. Our friendship ended the day they broke up and I honestly thought I'd never see him again and my sister would eventually find herself a good man.

&#x200B;

Well that didn't fucking happen. A year ago, Sister announces to the family that she and FBIL are back together. That they ran into each other and got to talking and she's decided to reconcile. Parents were wary but supportive but I was disgusted.

&#x200B;

So now it's today and FBIL has accompanied Sister to every family event since then. It's been awkward to say the least. Everyone is nice enough to him, but it's clearly not as warm as it was back when they were first dating. For my part, I just ignore him whenever he's nearby and kept interaction with him to an absolute minimum. He's definitely been affected by it and I can tell he wants to reconnect and make good but I'm not entertaining it.

&#x200B;

Things came to a head last weekend when it was announced that Sister and FBIL are engaged. They let us know at a family dinner for father's day and everyone was excited. Everyone except me. I don't know how he's tricked her into this, but he's still the piece of shit who hurt my sister and I'll never consider him family. But after they were done, he asked me if he could talk to me alone. He acknowledged the elephant in the room, that he's hurt Sister and our family, but that he'd like to make amends and heal his relationship with us since our families were about to merge.

&#x200B;

I unloaded on him. I told him in no uncertain terms that I don't care how he got back with my sister, that he's a piece of shit and always will be, that my parents and I will never see him as a member of the family and that my sister deserves better than to spend the rest of her life with a scumbag like him. He didn't say anything, just got real quiet and went back and rejoined the others.

&#x200B;

Today, I get a call from my sister crying and cussing me out. Apparently I had  an impact because FBIL called off the wedding, saying he's not good enough for Sis (true), that he loves her but she should spend her life with someone who her family will accept and that's not him. Now my sister's not talking to me and my parents and brother think I crossed the line and are calling me an asshole for sabotaging their relationship. I think they're being hypocrites. Idk Reddit AITA in this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I shouldn't have spoken on behalf of my parents, I admit my fault there.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: A lot of people are wondering why he left my Sister so quickly after I confronted him. Honestly I'm not 100% sure. But when I say me and FBIL were thick as thieves, I mean it. We told each other everything. I was there for him when his parents were hospitalized (car accident, both survived). I told him my secrets and he told me his. So I don't think it's a stretch to say he valued my judgment and cares a lot about how I see him.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: idk why I'm defending him rn, but wtf ever. I'd also like to add that prior to his cheating on my Sister, I honestly thought he was one of the best human beings I'd ever known, the type of guy who'd give you the shirt off his back if you asked. I loved him like a brother. That's what made his betrayal so painful in the first place.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4: Okay, I admit it. I'm an asshole and selfish. I shouldn't have spoken for others and I shouldn't have made it seem like the entire family was against him when really only I was. I suppose I'll have to try and undo some of the damage I've done but I have absolutely no idea how to even begin. This whole thing has been pretty humbling and embarrassing."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c253f9	2019-06-18 17:26:17	10-cho	AITA to the gym?	"So I signed up at the gym yesterday. I had been wanting to go to the gym for a while now and I don't mind paying the gym fees membership. The problem is is that I want to see the gym membership agreement before I give the gym my bank account information. I want to see what my rights are, etc.

I've used a 3 day guest pass in the past 3 days, went twice to the gym, and mentioned multiple times to the gym staff that I want to read the contract before I fully commit. They keep saying that once I sign the agreement I will get a receipt and a copy of the signed contract via email. 

Well I got the receipt email, but I haven't gotten a copy of the agreement that I signed. I'm hesitating on giving them my bank account info for monthly payments (already gave them my credit card info). There's a 5 day cancellation period after the initial agreement is signed, so I don't know if I want to cancel or not bc I want to see the contract before I agree to the contract. I'm on day 2 right now.

When I signed the other day, they explained the articles and had me sign the electronic signature thing, but i still want to read it myself.

I really want to go to this gym, it's got great reviews, really clean, friendly staff (I lost the key to my locked locker (I was borrowing their lock and key) and they broke the locker trying to get my stuff out and told me to not worry about it at all.)

Tldr: don't know if I should join a gym that hasn't sent me a copy of the agreement that I had signed and explicitly asked for multiple times

Anyways- we saw each other at another party but this time she was very distant. She hadn’t acted like that at any point before. She apologized a couple days later and tells me about ALL of her past.

One day one of my co-workers comes in my office and tells me she has brought her daughter (jr high age) into work because her internet is down at home, so if I see a girl walking around its just her. This co-worker has a back office where no one would even know the wiser her daughter would be in there unless she came out to use the bathroom. She could have not told me and I wouldn't have even known. This co-worker also has hundreds of patient charts stored in her office. The child may know better not to peek through them or whatever, but a simple glance and she could see a name, and what if the name was a fellow classmate and she said something to the classmate about it? Huge breach of HIPAA. I called my manager and told her, hey, I'm not trying to be a tattle tale, the employee told me the reason she brought her in and she has her in her office, which is full of patient charts. She made it seem like it was odd for the reasoning, but didn't make it seem like it was a big deal to have even brought her kid in. She also stated that another co-worker has also brought her daughter in as if to make it seem like its a normal thing. I looked through the policies and there isn't anything specifically mentioned about employees bringing in their children to have at work, but I did reach out to HR to get a clarification about it since I couldn't find anything. She stated:

""We have no provisions that would allow this. This would be very hard to manage, because of the variety of circumstances that could arise. Additionally, this would dramatically affect the ability to perform one’s job/position.

Not having a sitter would be a time that PTO would be utilized. That is why we have a generous attendance policy that allows multiple occurrences.""

This co-worker brings her daughter in again, this time so that she can be utilized to help a student shadowing our department learn how to perform Neuropsych tests. I have not told anyone about this, and no one else was in the office at this time either, except the intern, the co-worker, her daughter and me.

I don't want to make a big deal out of this, and wonder if I even should make a big deal out of this, but this just does not sit well with my work ethics and morals. What's the right thing to do?  I'm afraid of loosing a good relationship with my manager if I do this behind her back."	Asshole	0	0

c24zwf	2019-06-18 17:18:45	opheliasflowers541	AITA for firing my pet sitter?	"My family and I were going to be gone for 2 weeks & roughly 5000 miles away, so I was desperate for a pet sitter. Eventually someone messaged me after I posted an ad. The pet sitter was informed this was a “stay at the house” job not a “checking in” job. 

The sitter informed me the night before our trip that he/she works 3 jobs.  I was a little concerned regarding the amount of time the sitter would have at the house, but did reiterate they would need to come home & let the dog out.

On the 2nd day in, the sitter is gone working/? from 9:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m.  Does NOT come by the house during that time to let the dog out.
3rd day...sitter sends me text asking whose truck is in our driveway. Unbeknownst to me, it’s the house painter who stayed for 30 min. As a mother, I can totally understand the uneasiness of a stranger in front of a house.  I let the sitter know it was our painter and the sitter seemed fine afterwards. I did not hear back from sitter for the rest of the night.  At 9:45 pm, the sitter leaves the house.  Does not come back to rest of the night into the morning.  My dog has been alone for 11 hours & no potty break.  I text sitter at 9:00 a.m. the next morning to see where he/she is & has the dog been let out?  No answer.  5 minutes after my text, sitter shows up at my house.

I let the sitter know it was totally unacceptable to be gone all night while I’m paying him/her money to STAY at my house and care for our animals.  Sitter lets me know he/she was “spooked” by the painter & the thunderstorms (which I later learned there weren’t even any thunderstorms that night) and left. Does sitter text me to let me know his/her plans?  No.  
Does sitter take the dog with him/her? No.   
Sitter is let go immediately and asked to leave the house that day. Someone else resumed the job. 

To make a long story short, I forgot to send the sitter a check before I left town for the summer. The sitter “reminded” me, in a very less than polite manner, that I owed her for 2 nights & a 3rd day.  Mind you, she was gone from 9:00 am - 7:00 pm one of those days...and didn’t come by to let the dog out.

I let him/her know that they could come pick up a check in our mailbox.  I was then informed that they didn’t appreciate me “bad talking” them.  If talking about the irresponsible behavior of the sitter  is “bad talking” , then I’m guilty. Would YOU want a pet sitter that takes off and leaves your dog for 11 hours?  The sitter had the nerve to tell me “Your dog was perfectly fine”. The sitter then informed me, in the sitter’s own words: “Maybe you should have asked me if I work like every other teenager trying to afford college.

c24zi2	2019-06-18 17:17:52		AITA For Taking Back My Mug from a Coworker	"I (23f) work in an office with a communal kitchen like most offices. In the kitchen there are communal bowls, mugs (branded with company info) plates, silverware, etc. In addition to the communal mugs many people also bring in their own personal mugs for use. It is balntely obvious what mugs are communal and which are someones personal mug. For example, one of my co-workers went to Harvard so it is known around the office he uses his Harvard mug daily for coffee. It is not the kind of office environment where everyone shares everything, i.e- I wouldn't use this coworkers Harvard mug.

&#x200B;

In my role at the office I am in charge of loading, running and unloading the dishwasher. I have my own personal mug that I bring in and use everyday. Not that is matters, but I feel it's worth noting it is a very nice Starbucks limited edition travel coffee mug with a distinctive design. Anyway, since I am the one who loads and unloads the dishwasher, every few days I will run my mug through the dishwasher. Since I am the one un-loading it I feel comfortable putting my mug in it since I will be there to grab it when it's clean and take it to my desk. 

&#x200B;

Today someone else unloaded the dishwasher so I didn't immieditly grab my mug. About 30 mins into work I was walking though the office and noticed my mug on a coworkers desk. This caught me off guard. It felt like such an intrusion. In my opinion, it's an unspoken rule that you don't use another persons mug that they use *everyday* esspecially when our office supplies communal mugs. I'm a bit of a germaphobe and admittedly possessive of my things (especially sharing a cup with someone I barely know) so as I went through my morning this kept bothering me and I hated the feeling of someone using my mug. 

&#x200B;

I noticed my coworker wasn't at their desk and as I was walking by I simply grabbed my mug from their desk, rinsed it and put it in my purse to take home. I understand this is passive aggressive and maybe an over reaction but I feel entitled to take something that is *mine.* Some of my friends are saying I was over reacting while others agree it's an invasion into personal boundaries. So am I the asshole for taking back what is mine? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR Am I the asshole for taking back my own mug my coworker was using?"		1	0
c24zck	2019-06-18 17:17:32	Boobs_not_bombs	AITA for criticizing my boyfriend over (what I see as) prejudice behavior? (30F/33M)	"My bf feels that I am over critical and do not respect his viewpoints but from my perspective it would be wrong of my to let casual acts of prejudice about sexuality/race just go by unchecked. 

I should note that he fully supports gay rights, gay marriage, etc. but he’s looking for a roommate recently he basically refuses to consider this one guy bc he’s gay. He said he “just doesn’t want to see gay stuff or gay men being romantic at home or have to deal with any effeminate male friends that they might have.” I called this out as prejudice behavior bc he’s not even willing to talk to the guy to see if they get along before saying no. We’ve had a similar disagreement about the way he jokes with his guy friends - they think it’s funny to insinuate that the other one is gay as a putdown. To me this in inherently demeaning. If you don’t see being gay as a negative, how is it an insult?

Another example that I called out as being biased is the fact any that he pretty much refuses to date outside his race. He claims he’s not attracted physically to the vast majority of people of other races and even when he is, he wouldn’t risk having to be around their friends/family that he assumes he wouldn’t have much in common with or get along with (in the case of certain races). I have called this behavior prejudiced bc again, you assume the worst about a group without really getting to know them. You basically won’t even try due to preformed notions about what they’re like. He thinks I have essentially accused him of racism and am overly critical of his attitudes on this. 

Finally one more example of a slightly different topic. Recently he showed me a video of invasive hogs being shot from a helicopter and said how fun he thought this would be. I said that it was “disturbing” that he would find killing animals fun - not even to eat them bc they don’t eat this meat, but just for sport. He claims it’s not about killing but about the challenge and once again got upset, claiming that I was way over reacting and overly harsh. I feel I was just speaking my mind. 


He says that he hates PC culture and should be able to say openly say the things he does, but then when I’m honest and tell him how I see them he says I’m “berating” him. Who is the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c24zb3	2019-06-18 17:17:28		AITA for texting my girlfriends mom?	"To provide some information, me and my girlfriend are both 18 years old, and have just graduated high school. We dated for about a year, but the last 6 months, it had been off and on, but lately, things have been looking better, within the last month or so. 
Anyways, recently, she went on a trip with all her friends to a nearby city for a con and i had no clue when she was going to be back home, all i know is that the trip would be about a week long. So i asked her if she could text me once a day, or once every two days just so i know that shes doing okay. And she
So, at the beginning, everything was fine and she was doing just that. However, these last 3 days she didn't text me once, so i messaged her a few times over the last 3 days to see if shes okay, and she never responded to me for some reason. Which, in all fairness, i did say i would understand if she barely talked to me because i want her to have fun on her trip. But, she knows im a worrier, especially about people close to me, and how i can be. And i know that on her trip, she was going to be out late at night in a popular city with her friends, so me, being from that city, i know how shady it can be late at night. So this combined with how i am just isn't all that great.
After waiting for 3 days, i was really worried, so i texted her mom once asking if shes talked to her recently at all, and if she knew if she was okay. Well, it turned out that she (my SO) had just got home and texted me not even 10 minutes later saying that she was okay, and sorry, but to please never text her mother again.

So recently I got a knock on the door, opened up and there was my brother, 5 hours away from home and soaked to the skin from the rain. I ushered him in, told him to take a shower and got him into some of my SO's clothes. Finally, once he was settled, I asked him what was going on.

He explained that he felt behind of my sister and I, and wasnt sure whether he wanted to continue his career. He feels like he was behind because my sister and I both have families, a home and careers, but I pointed out my brother wasnt actually behind because he *could* have his own place but he chooses not to and is still saving money instead, and the reason why he hasnt found an SO is because he is career focused and there is nothing wrong with that.

He didnt really say much, just kind of listened and nodded. I offered for him to stay, but I said that I couldnt keep him for too long because Ive only barely just had my second kid and my SO and I are both tired. He agreed, but he has been at mine for a few days now and I dont wanna be an asshole and kick him out. Its also worth mentioning my brother has depression and ends up in deep pits like this when he gets burnt out, he used to come to me to talk about it when we lived together at my parent house and I feel like since he knows I am on maternity hes relying on me again.

Last time I didnt have enough time to stay in contact he overworked himself as a coping mechanism and ended up going to hospital from sleep deprivation, Ive told him he needs a job that is less hours and more laid back so he can regain a social life but I know he loves what he does deep down; I just think its too much because there is no limit on how much he can work.

c24w4h	2019-06-18 17:10:41	HilGMM	WIBTA if I asked my parents to kick my sister out of the house?	"My (14M) sister (23F) seems to be nothing more than a freeloader in our family’s house and treats us like shit

I want to get rid of her, she’s almost mid 20s and doesn’t have a plan (that I know of) to move and it’s making me go crazy, I want to consult my parents about her but that may be an asshole move. Below is a list of reasons on why we should get her to move already and hopefully you understand why I want to get rid of her:

She has distanced herself from us and feels like a stranger almost

She never pays for electric and water bills, she tends to increase her mobile plan that she doesn’t even pay for (my dad pays for it).

My sister treats my mom like an slave, always making my mom do shit for her that can full well do herself and will even raise her voice if my mom fails to do what she asks.

My sister (B) treats my other sister (S) like a maid, making S do all the chores, most of the cooking, and by then, B is still calling S unproductive because B did not see S do anything.

My sister exploits my dad’s miney, she likes to ask for a crap ton of money from time to time and is never even grateful for it, for example, she has an iPhone X but still treats my dad like some old man that’s nothing but an ATM.

And as for me, my sister likes to treat me like a little kid. She acts as if she has an impenetrable armor called **RESPECT** and anytime I try to make it so that she fixes her own problems, she starts saying how disrespectful I am, and then whines to our parents about my behaviour, meanwhile, when she misbehaves, I try to reason and talk to her and make her aware of her mistakes, I also tend to be teased at because of my insecurities.

I have a lot to say but to keep this under 3000 limit, basically, she acts like a baby everytime she comes home

Like I said, she prefers girlfriends over her family. That’s fine with us as long as she doesn’t mess with us **BUT** she wants to leave an extra space for a girlfriend she’s expecting to have on our **PARENTS’S SURPRISE SILVER ANNIVERSARY PARTY**. That day is coming fast and she decides to focus on girlfriends than a useful spot for a potential close friend for our parents, even S has REAL AND CURRENT a boyfriend yet she hasn’t said anything about bringing him along.

We have a place already, it’s our old house and it still has the electric wires, water pipes, furniture, and ulities there, she can stay there if she wants, it’s just that she doesn’t want to (maybe can’t) pay for the bills and my parents want to keep her because they have hope for her, I don’t.

Now I ask you again, is it such a dick move to make her move out of the house?

"This woman never said she likes me as a boyfriend and explicitly said she only likes me as a friend and ever will, after I had told her that I like her as a girlfriend, and I never mentioned that I intend to be her boyfriend. She dropped obvious hints like initiating to hug and hold my hand, asking “Are you nervous?” on a date, a vibe, saying “after we are just friends” she can drive me around and asked what if we are an actual dating couple in the future.

After 2 months, I asked her to kiss me because I wanted to get my first kiss, and she said yes and kissed me with tongue. 2 days later, worried, I asked her if she is upset. She sent me a text saying “We are still friends and we will see each other tomorrow. It is not like we are boyfriend and girlfriend or anything. I just have a different agenda than yours.”. I asked her what I did that made her think I thought we were more than friends, and she said she was sorry she said that, but the damage had been done and was unable to take it back. I repeated the question and asked if we can still be friends ”like we were before we kissed”, digging myself deeper in the hole of agony and despair. I showed my mom the convo, who advised me to apologize and say I value the friendship so I did and then she apologized too. Ok, fair enough.

The next day, she rested her head on my shoulder and said the kiss felt good, but gradually withdrew more distant in the next 7 weeks. She did not hug nor sit by me in the car because she feared it will lead me on. My mom talked to her mom who said she only wants to be friends. I ended the friendship because I did not want a friend who was uncomfortable around me, and at our therapists’ office I confronted her in the hall about our text conversation. AITA?"

c24us3	2019-06-18 17:07:37	masonstcyr	AITA for being mad at my mom and sister?	"(Mobile, sorry for formatting)

Last night, my mother (41F)  told me before I (18M) went to bed to take my sister (16F) to run an errand and drop her off at work before 10AM the next morning. This would normally not be an issue, but as I have a regular schedule for my summer job (12-6 PM), I like to stay up later, and with that comes sleeping in later. I agree, and say that I wont wake up on my own, and also remind my sister that it's her errand and I'm doing her (and my mother) a favor, and tell her that it her responsibility to get me up. I suggest we leave at 9, as it will give us plenty of time to do the errand and get to work.

Fast forward to 9 AM.

My sister sends my little brother into my room to get me up at 9:10. I'm ready to go by 9:20. I walk into my sister's room to tell her we're leaving, to which she snaps at me and tells me it's too late to go now since I wouldnt get out of bed. (?) I angrily reply that since she's not willing to go before work, (the errand was 30-35 minutes at the most round trip, and she works 3 or less minutes from my house. There was plenty of time to do both) calling me names, and being generally difficult, she can find her own ride to work. Then she says, ""Dad was right, you are a piece of shit"", and admittedly, after that, I had a few choice words of my own. You know how siblings are. 

She then gets on the phone and calls my mother at work, who also says I'm being the problem in the situation. I explain my side, and say ""I'm tired of her treating me like a goddamn taxi and showing no respect or gratitude in return."" I go back and forth with my mom for a while (because I swore, and for my attitude) and she obviously thinks I was being the asshole here. The kicker is that I sucked it up and drove my sister to work, 5 minutes early, anyways.

Now, even after all that, my mom angrily texts me and says that I'm grounded and isnt allowing me to see my girlfriend (who i had plans with for weeks and who will be going away for a week or two) or my friends. I tell her that I think shes being completely unfair in the situation, and my sister brought all of this upon herself for being irresponsible. I understand that I'm older, and I would normally be seen as the more responsible one, but I had literally told them last night that I wont wake up that early on my own, and my sister was completely rude to me for no reason other than the fact that I ""wouldnt get out of bed."" I normally have no problem doing errands or chores for my mom, as she lets me live rent free in between semesters, but when I get treated like nothing more than a taxi service and completely disrespected by the people I'm helping out, I feel that I was understandably upset at the situation, and still am.

c24tf1	2019-06-18 17:04:48	gdet5	AITA for calling my brother and expecting him to give me attention while he's dealing with something?	"Ok hear me out. My brother lives about 3 hours away and I rarely get to talk to him. He's currently at university so he doesn't get to visit very often. A few weeks ago, I came up with the idea that him and I could call each other and play games online together. So we played a few games and then a week later we did the same thing again. Then about a week ago, we arranged to play a game together again but later that day I found out I had an appointment and I asked if we could do it the day after. So it was about 5pm the next day and I rang him and we got on the game. He seemed distracted and went silent at times, which made me feel awkward because it was like I was talking to myself. Then my brother said something along the lines of 'sorry I'm distracted, my friend is going through a really hard time and I'm busy texting him' and I felt really bad because I felt like I was distracting him from helping his friend. I really wanted to play the game with him though because he was going to be busy with essays later on and it's not every day I get to do that. I kept on reminding him that I was here and that he actually had to play the game because he kept ignoring me and we did eventually play for a few hours, but about 2 hours in he said 'I'll tell him to put music in his ears' or something and I felt awful because I know how it feels to go through dark shit and sometimes it's good to be able to talk to a friend and let everything out. I don't know whether to feel like I'm an asshole or not

c24sok	2019-06-18 17:03:15	electrolytebitch	AITA for not choosing my best friend to be my maid of honor?	"Yesterday, my best friend (we’ll call her Emily) and I were talking about our future weddings and the topic of bridal parties came up. Full disclosure: both of us are in our early 20’s and single, but it’s just something we like discussing, especially since we watch those wedding reality shows. 

She said she’d choose me as her maid of honor, which is amazing and I’d be so honored, and when she asked who I’d choose, I said I’d choose my cousin who’s our age, who I also consider to be a best friend. This didn’t go over well. 

Backstory: Emily and my cousin, we’ll call her Amanda, do NOT get along. I don’t really care because the three of us don’t hang out together that often, if at all, so it’s not like there’s any real conflict between them I have to mediate. Emily thinks Amanda is privileged, spoiled, and snobby, and Amanda thinks Emily is rude, condescending, and arrogant. 

While I’ve been best friends with Emily for a little over 3 years now, I’ve known Amanda my whole life and she’s the closest thing to a sister I’ve ever had. Like sisters, sometimes we fight and she pisses me off, but I love her regardless. I try to avoid telling Emily if Amanda and I are arguing because it makes her more pissed off at Amanda because she’s super protective.

Anyway, I’d honestly choose Amanda as my maid of honor because she’s like a sister to me, and she’s more extroverted and socially skilled, so I wouldn’t have to babysit her at the wedding like I’d have to with Emily. She’d just be a better maid of honor in general. But I only told Emily that I’d choose Amanda because she’s family. She doesn’t know the other reasons.

Emily is still pissed off and says Amanda doesn’t deserve to be the maid of honor, and I’m being stupid and shortsighted. 

Please don’t tell me this is trivial and doesn’t matter! I know this “wedding” is hypothetical! But this conflict between me and my best friend is actually happening now.

ever and I doubt I'll ever stop playing it anytime soon. 
Recently I made an SMP (Survival Multiplayer) server for me and my friends, I set it up and everything, also making a discord server for, and let my friends invite whoever they wanted.

Well, one of my friends invited her friend (we'll call him C), who in turn invited 5 people from his friend group. Needless to say, the group didnt make a good first impression.
They immediately jumped on the server without even reading the rules in the discord server because C had given them the server ip before I agreed to let them in.

They started killing eachother, spamming the chat with death messages, and didn't listen when I told them to stop. The spawn was filled with heads and it was just straight up trashed.

One guy from the group said the n word and kept spamming memes in general, even though there was a meme channel for that. I then proceeded to warn him multiple times but he didn't listen so I eventually banned him. He called me a b*tch on the Minecraft server but I banned him there too. 

The next day, I talked to my mod about it, saying that I really don't like them but she said that they're a fun group, she only agreed when I kept trying to get her to understand my point of view.

c24ojg	2019-06-18 16:54:17		AITA for not going to my best friend's wedding?	"So, I've known this girl for about 15 years now. We got really good friends in school. After graduating from school we haven’t seen each other for a year. I lost a lot of weight during that time.

When we saw each other again, one of the first things she said to me was ""If I didn't have a boyfriend, I would totally f\*\*\* you"". I already gained some confidence due to losing weight, so we were pretty much always jokingly flirting with each other. She always acted weird when I was in a relationship. Even though she was pretty much always in a relationship as well.

Fast forward to six months ago from now. She got engaged. We decided to meet and somehow I decided to smoke some pot before meeting her. She immediately knew what was up and told me it's been ages since she smoked pot and I should call her so we could smoke together. She also told me that she's really freaking out because of the engagement and she feels like having one last ""adventure"" before actually getting married but she would never ever do that.

Two weeks pass and I call her and another friend of mine to smoke some pot. Around 11:30pm my other friend decided to leave. Before he left he said he needs to talk to me in private so we went in another room.

""If she stays with you alone you guys will certainly do something stupid. I don't know if you noticed but she is totally into you!""

Me: ""So, what do you want me to do? Tell her to leave?""

Him: ""Let me take care of that""

We got into my room again where she's waiting.

Him: ""<her name>, we have to go to work tomorrow. Im calling an Uber do you want to come with me?""

Her: ""Uhm you know I'll stay a little longer. <my name> and I have some stuff to talk about""

My friend and I give each other the ""Yup, f\*\*\*ed"" look and he leaves.

You know those cliché moments when you stare into each other's eyes in total silence when your noses almost touch and she keeps looking at your lips? We had three of those. After the third one I told her while panicking inside ""God, my couch is so uncomfortable. I totally need my bed right now!"" (F\*\*\*up, I know)

After a minute or so she decides to join me and puts her hand onto my chest and starts caressing me. In a total state of panic, I jump up and tell her that I must have left the stove on and run downstairs. (Yeah, really!)

I go up to my room again and she says, looking very uncomfortably: ""I should call <her fiancé's name> to come pick me up. It's really late""

A month later I received an invitation to her wedding. I was on friday last week. I finished work and left to go to her wedding. But it somehow didn't feel right. So I get out the train early, change routes and go to my buddy's birthday party.

She called me on 8pm, 2am, and 4am and wrote me every half an hour where the hell I am.

I haven't replied her yet and I'm not planning to. The thought of putting an end to my longest friendship I ever had really hurts me.

We have a huge age gap.She never lived with me, but our dad,me and my younger sister visited her side of the family. Few years ago I cutted her off because of that because she visited my family once and then rarely talked with me. I was mad at her because I didn't see the point of our communication if we were only going to talk once a year. At some point we made up and I thought things were going to change and she will try and be more around. I understand that adult life can be fast and everyone is always busy but getting together with your sister sporadically shouldn't be that hard. After making up, we still kept seeing each other once a year. Every time I tried to get together she had an excuse. 
I also have an older half-sister from my mom and she always makes time to be with me and my younger sister. Though she grew up with us but our age gap is still big. So comparing them, one is like a distant relative and the other is a real sister.
Now this week is my high school graduation. She missed my middle school one, so I was hoping she would come to this one. But once again, she has an excuse why she can't come.

I feel a million times better especially since my grandma can have my mom transport her (something that couldn't be pulled off otherwise.) A happy ending on AITA!

I'm in a show on my birthday. It's a big event and I'm really excited to be in it. No details cause duh. 

The price for the tickets are $35. I'm not expecting any friends to go because everyone I know is a broke ass bitch like myself. I have 1 free ticket and the person I wanted to give it to isn't able to attend. 

When I told my mom about the show she asked if there was a discount or anything for family. I let it slip about the free ticket and she lit up. 

Now, I don't like myself for it, but I'd rather the ticket go to waste than give it to her. It's passive aggressive on my part. 

My mom is kind to me, supportive, lots of lovely things. She's also minimal effort to most everything in life. Currently she lives with my grandma,  ""paying what she can,"" and only working 2 days a week. She's close to paying off student loan debt, which is cool, and pays for her own food, but it REALLY pisses me off she doesn't seem to even acknowledge paying my grandma reasonable rent is the right thing to do. She's paid off her loans at my grandma's expense is how I see it. 

I DO love her. But this is frustrating on the personal note that it's my birthday and she won't be going if I don't hand her the free ticket. Does it make sense that that hurts me a little?

I think I know I'm an asshole for where this is coming from (spite) but am I the asshole considering the overall situation?

PS I'll probably give her the ticket if I have nobody else, because that's a silly thing to waste.

Edit: i am definitely the ass hole with no way to justify it. Im going to use this situation to talk to my mom about how she upsets me with her financial decisions and my history of feeling loved via actions when convenient to her. Im going to give her the ticket and enjoy watching her have a good time. She'd appreciate it more than anyone i know considering the subject and festivities. 

Also, i can say it's my early birthday gift to her ha ha ha jk jk"	Asshole	0	0

I needed a way to get back home for the summer, since my internship starts soon and tried a lot of different options to get a ride home from my university to school. 

I knew my boyfriend was going to be busy in 2 weeks, because he’s going out of the country to present his research work, so I resorted to asking him last. I tried booking train tickets, but the cheapest option turned out to be hundreds of dollars bc it’s the end of the quarter and people are leaving university. I tried also carpooling with other people, but there wasn’t much room in other people’s car since a lot of people were graduating/moving their entire apartment and didn’t have room for my luggage and duffle bag.  

So, I resorted to asking my boyfriend to drive me home, especially since his own home is near mine, and he did want to go home to see his parents after finals and graduating as well. However, the drive home is 4 hrs. He then told me that he couldn’t drive me home because he had to study for his upcoming presentation every day (and to this day, he hasn’t started and has been playing video games and watching movies for the past few days straight), and needed to be back on Tuesday morning to see if the prof he works with was still there and hadn’t left for vacation yet. And he told me it wasn’t worth it to go home for three days and see his parents (even though he wanted to). I argued that he could practice presenting at home, but he said if he were to go home, he wouldn’t be able to do his work (but he’s done work at home before and he usually procrastinates until last minute to do his work at university anyways).

I was then desperate, because I really needed a ride home, and told him that I would pay him $50. When he heard that, he told me “yes, he can take me home”. This has happened several times, where I had to ask him a favor, and he wouldn’t help because he’s too “busy” and needs the entire day to clean his apartment or until I gave him some type of compensation. I don’t usually ask for favors as well... I’ve been with him for several years, and was wondering AITA for asking to drive me home?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c24kgb	2019-06-18 16:45:16		AITA for not caring if my BF is comfortable with my security camera watching the living room?	I have a motion detecting camera in my living room, where the tv watching, gaming, hanging out all happens. This is the room the front door leads into so if a thief were to enter my house I would have them on camera. I had the camera (along with perimeter cameras looking out the windows) before I met him...spying on him is not my motivation. He now lives with me (in my home that I bought before I met him) and he turns the camera toward the wall because he doesn’t like it looking at him. “What if I want to pick my nose or something, I don’t want you watching that” My issue is he never remembers to turn it around when he leaves and he’s also not diligent about locking up when he leaves. That part isn’t that big a deal because my kids are in and out most days and the house is left open by all of us often. My neighborhood isn’t bad, but in the unlikely event I get ripped off I want that camera footage.  I get his wish for privacy when he’s home alone, but my house, my possessions, my right to point a camera where I want. In my defense, whenever I look at the security ap and see him on the couch I say hello through the intercom so he knows I’m looking. I don’t creep on him secretly, but even if I did, it’s my house. Want privacy, go in the bedroom, right? Am I being a control freak?		1	0

c24jvf	2019-06-18 16:43:55	doneigoofedup	AITA for telling my(M 27) girlfried(25) that I work harder and therefore deserve time off?	"Ok so My girlfriend is an extremly pretty and smart woman. She and I have been dating for arround 5 years and moved in together 2 years ago . We split the chores arround 40% me 60% her. That was because till last year she was doing her PhD in a field in sociology and was home more often than me and didn't contribute equally finacially, as i work as a biologist in an Uni laboratory and the hours are extremly demanding but my pay is also better. 

She started her new job a few moths back. I can not give away too much information, but she has now longer working hours,field and paperwork. She comes home arround an hour before me on most days so we haven't changed our chore routine because she gets an hour of extra relaxation while i still work .

&#x200B;

So yesterday shit kinda hit the fan. My gf came home 30 Minutes before me and got straight to the couch with some snacks and netflix.

When i came home i saw the mess our appartment was in and asked her politley, why she hasn't got a headstart at cleaning . She just gives me that dirty look and basically spits in my face ""can't you see that i am very tired and need to relax a bit?"" 

I just rolled my eyes at that and went to take a shower. 

When i came out the kitchen was cleaned and gf was making some dinner. I went to fetch a new shirt and saw that our laudry was still dirty.

 Now let me make something clear. That day *her* chores were kitchen bathroom and laudry and *mine* living room and cleaning out our trashcans and taking care of the cat litter box.

I went to her and told her that we needed to play by our rules or else this would look like a trashy appartment. 

She just snapped at me and told me that it was unfair to beginn with. She is tired of cleaning after me like my mother and that i should take more responsibilty for the mess and that she is not my maid.

Then i snapped and told her that i work the whole fucking day and that i don't have the privilege that she has to sit most days at a desk and redact stuff. And that i work harder than she does and deserve more time of because of that.

She just blew up at me and accused me of thinking her field is lesser than mine just because its humanities and that that isn't what she does all day and that i don't respect her as a working woman and that i want her to clean all day.

She left and took the cat to stay at her sisters place .

i have tried callig her but i am also pretty mad that she wouldn't just stick to a plan we both constented to 2 years ago.

AITA or is she just overreacting?

Edit 1:wow I thought I would get like 5 responses. 1 thing... I am not a native English speaker this is not a shit post.
Second  I have mild ocd that's why I flipped at my gf not because I don't respect her.
Third I don't think her work is lesser I just think my workload is harder than that of a sociologist. She doenst have to work with chemicals and eye damaging radiation all day she works with minorities or something like that.
Fourth. She usually does the kitchen and cooks because she is a great cook lol. And she doenst like the way I clean the bathroom for some reason.

Update :guess you were right... I am a raging asshole. I see now how I've bee. Treating humanities like lesser because I think I just don't see the necessity of them in our society.

So a few hours ago my gf came home and I apologize for yesterday. She wasn't having it and said that it was just the straw that broke the camels back.

Apparently she has been unhappy in this relationship for a long time. She feels like I take her for granted and don't take her work seriously.
When I tried telling her that that wasn't true she caught me off-guard with the ""well tell me what I do for a living then""

Well I couldn't say it... That's when I realized that I was a raging asshole.
Well she took her clothes is keeping the cat and I have to do 100% of the chores because I don't have a girlfriend anymore."	Asshole	0	0
c24ilm	2019-06-18 16:40:56	JCMCX	AITA for asking my ex for advice on Sunglasses?	"A few months ago, I was working and broke a cheap Walmart pair of sunglasses. They didn't work that well and after switching from the nightshift to the day shift I really needed a new pair because the light off the water is unbearable. My ex is really into sunglasses, she has like 50 pairs, and used to manage a higher end sunglasses kiosk at an airport in college. I decided I wanted a decent pair and decided to text her to ask about what I should look for. She recommended Oakley because I'm a veteran and they have discounts for veterans. They're pretty durable, and the vast majority of them are polarized. She sent me a few models and styles to check out and I ended up buying a pair. 

Now my current girlfriend and my Ex are friends. Pretty decent friends tbh. My girlfriend asked if I had spoken with my ex and I told her I had. She got very very upset and even though she had complimented the glasses and said that she had loved them she now gets angry and says that she hates them. I picked out the frame and shades myself, but I did use my Ex's advice. 

My girlfriend is upset that I didn't ask her for advice on sunglasses, and that I didn't ask for her help at all. I didn't ask my girlfriend because she only owns like one pair and it's from a cheap $25 for 3 pairs type of kiosk at the mall. My girlfriend tends to get jealous of most girls I even speak with anyway. Friends I've had for years she gets very angry if she sees me snapchatting. If I reply to them on Twitter or like a tweet she gets angry. So I didn't mention it to her since I figured she would get mad anyway.

"Some background: I had a horrible encounter with depression that’s been building up for years but I don’t want to get into here, it made me absolutely miserable for a year and I’m lucky to be where I am today. It completely derailed my life, most importantly it forced me to stop going to school for the entire second semester of my freshman year and now I have to make up all of the courses. I’m doing okay now with some relapses into detrimental behaviors but I’ve managed to bring up my gpa from 2.9 to 3.2. 

The problem: my little brother (6 yrs) is showing a lot of the same behaviors I remember doing at that age, lying for attention, lack of responsibility, intense anger when small things don’t go his way, etc. I’m worried that he’s gonna go through the same things I did and maybe not come out of it okay and that terrifies me beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. I’ve tried to tell my family about this but nobody believes me. My family has a history of mental illness too, my mother has depression and my paternal grandmother has bipolar disorder

TLDR: I had a fucked up life and I’m afraid my little brother is going to go through the same thing. Am I the asshole for thinking my parents can and should fix it?"	No A-holes here	0	0

We used to be best friends, but as i went to a different Job (Job oppurtinity) we lose the freindship more and more. That's not the Problem. Every Time we met we were the ""good old memories"" Friends, but we both evolved own lives with own friends and own Problem. 

After his GF broke up with hin last year in January, i was there and talked with him. The time passed and i saw on FB that he first was in a new relationship, then they moved together and after one month they were engaged. So i was doptful if this is going to end well. But never mind they are still engaged and a better friend of him (friend of mine too) planned a stag party.

After a quantity of work devided the friend that he splits up the party, because of the new Friends of my engaged friend, so he planned a afternoon with all the ""good old memories"" friend and his father (also a good friend). So one morning wrote the father in the group chat that the activity of the afternoon would be to expensive (100€) and also in this group would be not a single friend of the engaged one, then he left the group. We were shocked and so we still planned the activity with the engaged friend, because we thought it qould be a good idea.

One Day the witness took all together and said we should plan on the day with all together. The date was pretty bad for me so i left the group and i thought we still make the activity. The Afternoon is this saturday so i asked the friend, when do we start. He replied and said that they all cancelled the activity and planned another activity on the sam day at the evening... 

I am so sad and also angry that there is this dislike by the new friends. It is okay that he has the new friends, but i am not nothing or am I? I would like to tell my engaged friend that i can't go to the wedding. It would be sad, but the father dislikes me and the others obviosly and the new friends of him will take all the time. I am in a really stressful Situation so there would be a better planned day if I don't go to the wedding and sit next to the party..."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c24f5m	2019-06-18 16:33:13	Spagghetti-Slap	AITA I broke my mothers phone because I was angry	"I have done many bad things to my parents and myself, if someone looked at how my life played out they’d say I have omnicidal rage. For some perspective, I’m a Muslim and I live in Iraq.

Being a Muslim in Iraq (this is specified for a reason) is a pain in the ass, you have to pray 5 times every single day and if you don’t then your parents will kick your ass. I don’t hate praying, in fact I pray all the damn time, it’s just that my mother (not my father) has a hard time believing that I prayed. Whenever it comes to this, she always takes my phone, and it’s not like this is a rare occasion, just today I told her that I prayed and when she didn’t believe me I just said “you’re not Allah, are you? I don’t pray for you” which didn’t work very well.

She does the same shit every single day but today I felt the most rage I have ever felt in my entire life, I wanted to frame her for murder or some shit, that’s how angry I was. I was just chillin minding my own business and she comes to me and begins yelling at me to pray, when I responded with “I already did” yup, phone taken. This sounded like an underwhelming experience but if you went through this for 30 days straight and having to prove that I prayed, just kills me inside. I mean how tf am I supposed to prove it? I have zero evidence for it. And so I was done, I felt like slamming my head against a wall but instead I took my mothers phone and smashed it on the ground. As I expected, it broke, my mother couldn’t believe her eyes and when she confronted me I gave zero shits about how angry she was, I just yelled back. My dad wasn’t very happy and I just went to my room and sat against the wall with my face in my arms just regretting everything. I am a prick

AITA?

Edit: I forgot to mention that this was like 2 months ago, I remember apologizing profusely and then being as nice as I could to my mother. My phone was taken away for almost 3 weeks but it doesn’t matter. It broke my heart to just come home and see my mother not doing anything because her phone isn’t functioning. But it doesn’t end like this, my father fixed her phone and everything is back to normal. I started doing chores and talking to her more which clearly improved our living conditions. But *again*, it doesn’t end there. I have another story in which me and my mother are at fault. I am doing alright and I make sure to pray when my mother does. I will still regret doing it forever.

Edit 2: I don’t have anger issues as I have stayed calm for the 29 days she has done this for, I just decided that day that I had enough of everyone’s shit. I was never angry with my mother before that day."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

This plan has been in progress for over 6 months. Headed to the grand canyon with parents, myself and husband and our child. The parents were supposed to be driving and pulling the trailer so that we can stay inexpensively.

 Father has had carpal tunnel for a year or more and has refused to go to the dr. He finally has an appointment this week. Mother has decided that if he needs surgery,  it should be scheduled next week and has decided they will cancel the vacation.

I am angry that they have decided to do this now.  We have planned for months and have changed schedules and taken time off work.  He had lived with it for a long time and kept saying he was fine.  Why now? I asked if he could wait a week or two but she says it Has To Be Now. Mother says I'm just being an asshole and should just accept that we can't go. We will just be out any deposit and just eat the time off and I'm supposed to be fine with it all.

At this point I'm too angry to go with them even if they decide to schedule for a later date. I'm looking  at other places to go next week for just my husband, child, and myself.   So am I the asshole?

**UPDATE** now that we are off work, I can update a bit. 
 Per friend: 1 no other issues such as heart problems or neuro.
2 Mom has always been somewhat my way or the highway. Dad is pretty passive. 
3 I hadn't considered the driving aspect being worse with carpal tunnel. I'll ask him if that's why he needs the appointment now when I see him  
4 his PCM had diagnosed him with carpal tunnel a few years ago but he hadn't done anything.  He retired shortly after the diagnosis.  He's going to see a specialist on Thursday.  
5 I don't think they have even thought about pt or other options.  Mom usually goes worst case first.  
6 it was their idea to take the camper instead of hotels.  Dad won't let anyone else drive his camper or truck.  Can't even get a hotel anywhere close at this late stage.  I looked.

&#x200B;

This past father's day weekend, I had family over which included my brother (who works for my uncle) and my sister. My uncle's daughter just got engaged so my sister grabbed lunch with her to catch up. My sister told us that during the lunch, both daughters of my uncle were there and expressed some strange behavior of my uncle. My uncle has an administrative assistant and apparently my uncle told his daughters to not mention that he is married when around this admin. assistant. One of the daughters also said that when my uncle's wife was out of town that he had a big work gathering at his home and he took down every photo of his wife.... **Sketchy** 

My brother also had stories about my uncle and his admin assistant. They had a company trip to Vegas in which everyone attends. It was the evening and after dinner they wanted to go out and explore and do what people do in Vegas.. Well my uncle and his assistant decided they were tired and wanted to stay behind.... **Sketchy**  

My brother was in charge of conducting interviews for internships for the summer. He gave a list of worthy interns to my uncle and the person at the bottom of the list ended up getting the internship....Why? Because it was the assistants son.   Once my brother said this I was LIVID. My uncle said last year that he could get me an internship or even a potential job. Fresh out of college, I was confident that my uncle had my back.... Never heard any feedback after submitting my resume to him.  But his daughter just got an internship at the company, and when he was confronted about it he said ""Oh its different""...

&#x200B;

I never really had this type of situation in which I feel conflicted. Yes he is family and he treated me well when I was younger but I (25M) feel like he has this new perception to me and I don't want to associate with it.

&#x200B;

I lost all respect I had for him. I don't even want to see him or talk to him when this wedding occurs. It isn't my place to tell his wife what's going on, but I feel disgusted knowing that he is the way he is.

c24csi	2019-06-18 16:28:12		AITA For Not Alerting My Ex-Girlfriend of Her Leaked Nudes	"Alright Goobies, for starters, I (23M) was not the one who leaked them. While a few of the nudes I saw were definitely ones she sent me during our relationship, a majority of them were more recent and were definitely taken after we stopped dating. For the sake of anonymity I will not be providing  the website on which these nudes were found.

&#x200B;

This is either A. a case of revenge porn from a different ex or B. one of her devices was hacked and the pictures were stolen. If either of these happened to me, I'd definitely want someone to make me aware that the pictures were out there so that I could take legal action against whoever was responsible. That said, our breakup was messy and dramatic. Since some of the pics were nudes that she had sent me during our relationship I worry that she'd accuse me of leaking them, and potentially make formal accusations against me. While it would hopefully be very easy to prove my innocence, that kind of accusation alone (while baseless) would still be an embarrassment if friends or family heard about it (my family and her family have somewhat frequent contact due to having relatives that belong to shared organizations).

&#x200B;

On the other hand, knowing that the pictures are out there and doing nothing just feels a little wrong. My roommates agreed with my concerns, but also share the opinion that they would definitely want to be told if intimate pictures of them were ever leaked. What do you think?

We were privately discussing who we thought was cute, hot, etc. We work at a pizza place and it was a pretty slow day, which is why we were having this conversation.

A brings up a coworker, T (18M) and I tell her immediately he's hot. This is apparently a big no-no and pissed off another coworker who had been cleaning nearby. L (22F) accuses me of being creepy and to stop. She tells me that I am 'robbing the cradle' and ""reminds"" me that T barely graduated high school, and to act my age. I get angry because I'm not trying to date him, just stating my thoughts in a PRIVATE conversation that L wasn't even involved in. 

L then attacks my character and tells me to grow up with this shit-eating sneer on her face, that she knows I like to hit on people her age or younger (I had a fling with a former coworker (21M) and there was a big fight because he chose to date another coworker (20F) than date me). She tells me to date people my own age or better yet, don't date anyone here at all. I tell her to piss off and that I'm not trying to pursue anybody. A tells me to let it go, shut up. 

I'm more hurt than angry because L is usually quiet and never speaks much, only to her own best friend that is a manager here. She seemed very smug about her win and I want to report her to her manager-friend and our main manager for attacking me.

c247uz	2019-06-18 16:16:48		AITA for pushing a girl at a concert for bullying my sis then getting kicked out	"For reference at the time I was a (17F) and my sister was a (16F). This happened quite a while ago and I still feel conflicted about it.

 I was with my sister at a small music venue and it was PACKED. People were pushing and shoving and cutting each other like crazy. I was excited to see the band play, but I was feeling very claustrophobic/anxious because it was the first time I had ever been to a standing concert. 

Okay so to get into the meat of the issue, two girls start to basically push through the crowd. They looked around 25+ and they get up to my sister. They try to cut her to get to the front and my idea is to form kind of a human barrier to block them from passing. I didnt think it was fair that we were there longer and they got to get in front of us. However, my sister didnt seem to be in sync with me. She pretends to mock fall on the other girl passing her and she keeps repeating ""oops sorry"" everytime they try to pass her. It's kind of hard to explain but it was really dark so that's all I really saw.

The girls get mad and they yell at my sister saying ""she doesnt have to be a bitch about it"". The venue goes kind of quiet becuase people were  just so into the drama. I just got so worked up and mad in that moment that I pushed one of them. Not hard but hard enough that she almost fell over. Then I just dig into her calling her a whore and a bitch and when I think about it now I'm just so disgusted by how barbaric my actions were. I exploded at this girl calling her pathetic/disgusting for picking on a 16 year old. I'm NEVER violent I dont believe in hitting people so I just dont know what happened to me.

Anyway the girls dont pick a fight and just walk away. The crowd just starts hooting and hollering. People were giving me thumbs ups etc.  It was the mob persona so I dont just assume that a bunch of people hooting means that I'm not an asshole. Anyway the bouncer comes in and she grabs me and my sister to throw us out saying those girls were just joining their friends in the front. I dont know if I believe that and I was just so shellshocked that we were being thrown out that I clammed up. I wanted to tell her that those way older girls started it by trying to push/mentally abuse a 16 year old.

Furthermore my sister seemed to kind of resent me for it. I was trying to stand up for her but she just shuts the conversation down when I tried to talk about it. I dont think I should have used violence and I'm probably the asshole but I was hoping to get some feedback."		1	0

c246s3	2019-06-18 16:14:13	seppukusama	AITA for considering estrangement from my brother?	"Some context: I (19M) am the oldest of 3 kids, with the middle child being my younger brother (18M). Because of numerous familial issues and constraints, we have had to put up with a less-than-ideal living situation. This has led to many fights and quarrels. But many of these problems arise due to the actions of my younger brother.

&#x200B;

My younger brother is definitely the most spoilt child. My parents always fed his pride and ego so much by consistently validating him and sending him to an expensive private school where he essentially became a selfish, narcissistic sociopath. He would universalize his problems by blaming everybody but himself for his mistakes and shortcomings. Whenever he wanted something, he would throw a tantrum till he got what he wanted. He would go to all lengths necessary: crank calling the police, breaking doors... there was one time he dismantled the house gate because ""if I can't leave, nobody else can"". Nevertheless, my parents still shower him with absurd amounts of affection and validation.

&#x200B;

I am now in the army. As such, I spend no time at home, except during weekends. Every single time I head home from camp, I always end up as collateral in a problem he starts, for the stupidest of reasons. E.g.: Last week, he was fighting with everyone at home, even getting physical, because they had forgotten to buy him a box of cereal. Every week without fail, I get dragged into his problem because my parents see it as my responsibility of the eldest to set him straight (in my opinion, to clean up the mess they created), which causes him to inevitably target me next. Even when I decline, he still finds ways to involve me in his issues for no good reason, and with his most recent bout of bullshit, I'm getting really really pissed off.

&#x200B;

I have tried to reconcile after every fight he has with me, because it's just not in my nature to seek out conflict or to be part of a system that prolongs it. As such, I try my best to resolve issues as quickly as possible. But now I'm just sick and tired of having to be involved with any of his bullshit. I think it is safe to say that, if this guy is willing to tear the house apart over some cereal, then he's an irredeemably lost cause.

&#x200B;

After all that has happened, I am really tempted to estrange from my brother in the near future. I'll let karma take its course, and when he needs my help, I'm just gonna leave him for dead. A leopard can't change its spots, and there is absolutely no indication at all that my brother, at 18 years of age and so insufferably selfish and problematic, is gonna become any better of a person when he grows up and goes out into the real world. I asked my closest friends about whether what I'm doing is fair or not, and a few of them have told me that it would be a dick move to let family down. From my perspective, he's made growing up very painful for me, and that is something I am simply not willing to forgive.

He’s an extremely affectionate and sweet dog to me and everyone he knows however he gets very anxious around strangers and whenever new people try to pet him he gets uncomfortable and starts to growl. Today on our walk a small child maybe three or four years old starts running towards my dog and I with it’s arms out and I pick up my dog and say “he doesn’t like strangers very much but you can say hi” and the mom behind gave me a disgusted look and muttered something to herself. Now my dog has never bitten anyone but usually when strangers want to pet him they ask first and approach him slow and gently and this made me nervous so I didn’t let the kid pet him.

For background I am a doctor MD and a surgical resident, I recently started dating a woman, and it became disconcerting to me that in the 1 month I've dated her she's had 3 menstrual cycles.
I asked her about this and said that while this concerned her it's the way her menstrual cycle has always been (in our country it's kind of taboo for people to talk about this so a lot of women are not very educated when it comes to their own cycles/sexual health). She also refers to be frequently tired (which is very telling of a probable iron deficiency vinculated to the irrgulararities in her menstrual cycle) I mentioned all of this to her as nicely as I could and offered to tell her what studies she should get and reassured her that either me or any gynecologist could help her with this, being that the treatment Is very simple and not harmful in most cases. She reacted poorly and said that she does not appreciate the fact that I speak negatively about this like there is something wrong with her. She asked me to not bring it up again and left in very bad mood. I feel that I might have over stepped a boundary in our ""relationship"", but I didn't mean to infringe on her privacy, but at the same time I feel compelled to inform her and help her with this issue as in the long run it can be detrimental to her repruductive health."

c243u9	2019-06-18 16:07:44	throwaway18271T8191W	AITA for having a secondary motive for helping a member of my AA group	"   So this might be a lot more complicated than the title makes it seem. 
    I’ll start by saying I’m a recovering alcoholic.           After my last bender, i realized I needed help and since then I’m proud to say that finally I am making a lot of progress and have been a lot healthier and happier. I still go to my support group. 
    At the last meeting a man who I recognized introduced himself. I know him because for the last few years he’s been in love with me. Showing up at my work constantly and asking me out every chance he gets. I unfortunately don’t feel the same, but he’s extremely persistent. At first I avoided him, but now knowing he has a similar struggle as mine, I feel a lot more sympathetic towards him. Here’s where it gets complicated: I’m in love with his coworker/best friend. 
   In the midst of my addiction, I formed a relationship with him, and I scared him away (unrelated story having to do with me and his estranged father). He was a huge reason for my wanting to get help, though lately we’ve been pretty distant. 
   Anyway, I brought my fellow AA member into an unofficial sponsorship situation, as I truly think I misjudged the guy and I could really help him. While I do sincerely hope to help, I’m ashamed to admit that I also think this would be a great way to prove myself to his friend/my ex, and consequently get closer to him again. Am i being selfish? Is it possible that I could have ulterior motives without realizing, and does that negate whatever good id be doing?"	Asshole	0	0

Fast-forward a few months, and the stuff is pretty active, get back into touch with fellow RP'er on another platform, who was having D make the same problems (altering character lore, changing other char's backstories, etc.).

About a month passed and he hasn't changed a single thing. We decided we had enough. We tell D multiple times why he does it and always avoids the question by going offline and/or ignoring us completely. When we FINALLY have him into a corner, my friend asks why he always does this. D replies with being bullied in high-school and disliking confrontation (which he didn't mention the previous times).

We were long-distance until about a year ago, when he moved in with me in the flat I own - he was still living with his mum and it was having a really bad impact on his mental health.

We're both disabled, mentally and physically - I have a bunch of neurological and joint conditions, he's got joint problems, we're both depressed and autistic. I work full-time; he's unemployed, having dropped out of university for health reasons. When he moved in, I told him that I needed him to get a job within six months - not for financial reasons, he's got a trust fund so he's not draining my income, but just because I wasn't comfortable being the only one working. Six months turned into a year, he's still unemployed but is volunteering at a charity shop now, three days a week.

I don't know how hard he is or isn't trying to get a job, but I do know that if I needed a job in the area, I could get one within a few weeks - we live in a touristy area so there are a lot of low-grade jobs pulling pints, working in shops or hotels, etc. It would be one thing if he were being a house-husband, but we're sharing chores approximately equally, and I feel bad asking him to do more than half. 

If I demand that he gets a real job or moves out, WIBTA? Bearing in mind that he can't move back in with his mum, I would essentially be making him homeless; also bearing in mind that his excuse for not doing more is his disabilities, which are less severe than mine in most ways but still definitely an issue. Last time Will lived alone, at university, he basically crashed and burned. At the same time, the stress is burning me out, and I'm doing way more than half the work in our household overall, while he demands more and more time and emotional support."	Asshole	0	0

So my late wife( she died fighting cancer )and I invested our money and decided to set up something like a trust fund for our daughter.

For context, I’m a music artist. My “manager” is pretty unprofessional. All I know is that he used to be a manager of a semi-big artist who had a hit in 2016. He never properly introduced his management company or details on what he’s done. He explains he works 18 hours a day and is busy most of the time.

He’s been relatively helpful with advice but recently he’s been getting on my nerves. He’s been calling me in the middle of the day randomly and then is passive aggressive when I’m unable to answer. He refuses to text anything other than “call me” and he it’s not necessarily important either. I’m on vacation and I’ve told him this and there’s no reason for me to have to pick up my phone unless it’s serious (which it’s not, because he hasn’t officially managed me so it’s not money etc)

At this point, I don’t see any benefit or continuing this business relation. He isn’t invested into my brand enough to know about it, but wants to manage and control it. He hasn’t provided any validation of his credentials and it seems like a waste of time continuing. 

He wants me to call him later but I feel like telling him off for the antics and blocking him or just straight up blocking him and not having to worry about it. WIBTA for that and what do you think is the right way to go about it?

2 years later, Jane reveals to me that she and joe started dating online. I was like   oh  okay  I was a bit apprehensive both because joe lives in another country and the age difference, so I told her that she should be careful and shouldn't be too serious.

Fast forward a year, Jane revealed that she wanted to see joe for their one year dating anniversary, but Joe insist on the 2nd year. I found out that besides 3 pictures they have never met or even webcam. She claims he was too shy.

Nearing their second year anniversary she told me joe said it was too dangerous in jamaica for her to go there. ??? people go to Jamaica for vacation all the time, can't you just meet him at some resort? So i tell her, this isn't normal at all.

&#x200B;

another year later, I still talk to jane few times a week. At this point, she has grown so used to the attention he gives her, she gets incredibly lonely whenever he's not on.They still have never met nor webcam.  but she is so serious about it. She talks about get married and how her children already loves himand every time i'm just screaming in my head YOU HAVE NEVER MET HIM

&#x200B;

Then her birthday comes by. He disappeared for 24 hours. She calls me upset that he is ignoring her on her birthday. we had a heart to heart and i tell her, this isn't real, he refuses to meet you. You are wasting your time with him. It's been 3-4 years. How many more years do you want to waste on his guy? She cried saying she is too use to having someone to talk to everyday that she can't help it. He shows up again after 24 hours. he claims that he was out with his family and when he got home he was tired so he went to sleep. I'm like and you couldn't give her one call or text to say happy birthday???

&#x200B;

A month later, her mom passed away. She calls me crying. Joe disappeared again (3 days).she was crying every night both about her mom and joe disappearing. when he came back, he said he was taking a break because he doesn't like to hear woman cry.  At this point i'm furious. I tell jane, you have to break up with him. This guy doesn't care about you. She agrees with me. I texted her everyday encouraging her. I thought it was working. I logged into one of the games we use to play and noticed that she wasn't online but joe was. It was one of those games that you can just join one of your friend's game without asking them (diablo 3). I joined joe's game and there she was... playing with him... I check back on my friends list, she was offline. She had blocked me so that i wouldn't see that she was playing with him.

&#x200B;

I was so angry and disappointment. I called her and yelled at her asking her why she would do such a thing to herself. Next day, i was blocked from everything.

They still lived together and she was pretty candid about the issues they had been having leading up to her breaking up with him. We talked for a bit and although she never flirted with me directly we became close friends and she would send me screenshots of guys she had been talking with. She eventually ended up getting vaguely committed to making a thing with one guy. She even told me she was deleting the dating app so she gave me her number so we could stay friends. 

She ended up going out with that guy once but the date was bad and she said it made her sad. She had sent him a nude though which she sent me the screenshot of (didn’t contain the actual picture) just their conversation and a small thumb nail.

After two months, she sort of stopped talking me for a few days so I reached out to see what was going on. I know she has a illness that she was having a test for and I was genuinely concerned. 

She had talked with her ex after the bad date and they had agreed to go to therapy together and work on things. 

She said a part of that would involve us no longer talking since we met on tinder and she didn’t feel it was appropriate. 

I get the feeling that maybe she wasn’t truthful and that maybe she was cheating on her ex so I mention it. She says that I am wrong and that he had attempted to date as well even having a profile on tinder himself. I attempted to locate any evidence of this but couldn’t find it. 

I tried to call her a few days ago and she picked up and her ex asked who it was and she said a friend and then said they were on a date and couldn’t talk long. It was weird. She has never been so short with me. 

She eventually blocked me because I told her that I thought it was shitty she would cheat and then act like she didn’t. 

I feel like her ex should know. If he already knows that she was messing around and they were really broken up then no harm no foul but if he doesn’t it might keep him from making a mistake.

c23obz	2019-06-18 15:32:56	coloredneon	AITA My boss asked me not to tell my (hardworking) coworker that I’ll be getting a raise and bonus while he gets nothing.	"I am 23, my coworker is 40. We are basically paid the same but I do so much less work than him and I’m leaving in 3 months. He plans on staying for years.

Today, I found out I was getting a raise and bonus. Minutes later, I get a call from my boss telling me that he made a mistake so I’m the only one that’ll receive a raise and bonus. He then proceeded to tell me not to tell my coworker.

My boss accidentally gave him a average performance review, not realizing that it’ll affect his raise and bonus. So now, he gets nothing.

I see how stressed my coworker is all the time and he won’t be able to get another raise for a whole year. 

I honestly don’t want to tell him because I leave so soon. I want my last months to be easy. But I feel like I owe him this because he puts so much into this job.

I couldn’t imagine not knowing that I should’ve received a raise and didn’t but my coworker who is younger, does less work and really could care less about the job is.

c23nqo	2019-06-18 15:31:33	Achieve2Receive	AITA for saying no to letting my wife's best friend surprise her with a visit during a bad time?	"About a year ago, my wife was having a stressful time at work, and was coming home weary and stressed every night. Once Friday came around, she decided to buy us some alcohol to have a weekend where she could relax, sleep in, and forget about work.

Saturday night comes, and we are wasted. We're having a decent time playing games together, but she's still really tired. So, she decides to head to bed early, telling me not to bother waking her up tomorrow, as she really would just like to sleep in as much as possible to try to catch up on some sleep.

10:30 AM, she's had about 6 hours of sleep. I'm awake, trying to be as quiet as possible and trying to keep the cats away from her so that she cannot be disturbed. Suddenly, I get a text from her best friend, which of whom she hasn't spoken to in some time due to a couple of arguments they've had in the not-so distant past, telling me that they're in the area and if it's okay to surprise my wife with a sudden visit. At this point, I'm in a slight panic... I don't know what to do. Do I wake my wife up and inform her so that she can scurry to get ready? Do I agree and let them wake her up in a blurry daze of a hang-over? I weigh my options, and think about how stressful my wife has had it in the last while, and I politely tell them that this time is not the best time...

Once I tell them this, they begin to almost berate me, telling me that a good husband would've agreed, and that I should be ashamed. At this point, I'm having a difficult time with the situation, so I wait for my wife to wake up and tell her what has happened. She begins to cry about it, but she was upset with them for putting me in such a bad situation...

c23njg	2019-06-18 15:31:06	mercy2020	AITA for not wanting to contact an old friend	"A little backstory first: I had this friend June in elementary school that I was super close with, but since then I haven’t seen her much since. Now back in elementary school June was one of the only friends I had, although I’m not really even sure how we became friends, seeing as we’re practically opposites. Our friendship always seemed solid to me, but looking back three years later, I can see how it could’ve been considered toxic. She’d twist perfectly innocent jokes into attacks on her, pull ‘pranks’ such as lying about there being bees nearby when she knew I was terrified of bees, demand first choice of birthday favours from my party because she was ‘moving’ (she used that lie multiple times), judging my interests and hobbies, as well as my anxiety about terrorism, even though she knew that there had been a school shooting in my town. The last time I saw her was two or three years ago, and it’s been radio silence ever since. 
Fast forward to today. This morning I got an email from my classmate Sophie. In her email she said that she’d seen June at a hockey game, and that June had asked about me and said she wanted to get back in contact. Sophie gave me her phone number and I wrote back thanking her and saying that’d I’d try to reach out when I got back home.

I will no longer be responding to comments on this post, and anybody who goes out of their way to contact me will be ignored. Please stop commenting - I've heard feedback, now I'm done.

Small introduction: I'm a teenage girl living in the UK. I'm almost 100% certain that I'm autistic - I've had several GPs and a psychotherapist agree with my self-diagnosis, but it's yet to be officialised. My main special interest right now is the Assassin's Creed franchise.

So... today, I had a meltdown because my parents literally pushed me against the way my brain works. Basically, after I while, I literally cannot focus on a task anymore without ""Recharging"" via interacting with a special interest. It's just the way my brain works. I'm homeschooled, and today, I was practising quadratic equations, which I find EXTREMELY difficult. My mother was basically pushing and pushing me to do things when I didn't understand what was going on, and eventually, she said that I couldn't play Assassin's Creed today. This pushed me over the edge, and I had a meltdown.

I understand that it can be a hard job to be a parent, but she wouldn't understand that I literally couldn't understand her explanation. She wouldn't understand my repeated explanations that I HAD to take a break and have some gaming time. I'm still REALLY stressed-out and on-edge, and basically on the verge of tears, constantly. My brain is still in shutdown mode, and it probably will be until I can play. However, I do get that I can be... very loud and difficult to deal with during meltdowns.

c23n2d	2019-06-18 15:29:53	QuirkyMail	AITA for not tipping my Electrologist	"I (32F) have recently decided to seek permanent hair removal via electrolysis for excessive facial hair that I have as a result of Hypothyroidism. I was diagnosed around puberty and have been battling excess hair growth and other symptoms since. A few months ago I got a better(not great) paying job and moved back in with my parents to save money because I was not saving any money during my time at my previous job. I'm doing a great job saving because I'm living rent free and earning more I decided to finally allow myself to splurge on some permanent hair removal. I found a technician in my area and I have so far met with her twice once for a 15min consult/mini session (free) and a 1 hour ($90) session. When considering the cost I hadn't really thought of tipping as beauty treatments of any kind have always been an extravagance I couldn't afford, and I don't see these sessions as your average beauty treatment-- for me this is a medical issue and I think its necessary to my well-being. During my hour session Electrologist is able to remove a 5""x 4"" area (bit under half the area I want treated), 2 weeks after, seems like 80% reduction of hair growth (only time will tell). Afterwards when paying the bill I see the tip line and I left it blank because I had no clue if I should feel obligated to tip after every session and if so how much? The more I thought about it I began to feel like I shouldn't have to tip at all because my hair growth is a medical issue. My facial hair has destroyed my self esteem, and because it is coarse, dark and grows aggressively (shave in morning, have stubble by evening) it's impossible to hide 100%. I don't date anymore because the thought of a partner feeling my stubble is too embarrassing. This weekend I told my sister about my not tipping and asked her thoughts and she basically said I was being rude. I explained my logic ""If I were getting my armpits, I'd absolutely tip"" and her response was that Electrologist doesn't care about my logic she wants her tip. I've browsed subs discussing whether or not to tip and I see conflicting answers.

Is this tipping culture run amok or AITA? 

Electrologist says ""It takes what it takes"" so I have no idea how many sessions it will take to complete. WIBTA if I waited until final session to tip a lump sum?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c23m0q	2019-06-18 15:27:33	Wallaroo_Trail	AITA for yelling at my neighbor and calling the cops?	"So I live in this dense suburb full of apartment buildings. On a Sunday about 4-5 weeks ago my neighbor who seems to be a recent immigrant from an African country put this guitar amp (?) out, right in the middle of his driveway at 8AM and used it to blast music all day long while working on his car, until like 9 PM. I could hear it in every room of my apartment, even with the windows closed. I thought, alright, we all want to have some fun sometimes. Next Sunday came along and so did his music. And another Sunday. I started contemplating what to do about it as it started driving me nuts, and I wasn't sure if I should address it directly with him or just call the cops to avoid him knowing who I am and starting a neighborhood war. Anyway, I ended up doing nothing about it. This last Sunday though, I was out doing the groceries with my girlfriend in the AM and as I was pulling into my driveway, I saw that his speaker was out again and the music on full volume. I got out of my car, dropped the grocery bag, walked across the street straight to that guy and told him ""You need to turn off that music, it is super annoying and I can't focus on anything."" He started something about how it was his right to have the music and how he can have it on until 10 PM or something and at this point I wasn't even listening anymore and something snapped in me and I started yelling at that guy like I've never yelled at someone before in my life, telling him about how there's 400 people in this neighborhood and his fucking idiot ass was pissing off every single one of them and how he could go fuck himself. Dude was literally shaking. I turned off his amp and walked into my apartment, when I heard that he turned the music back on. I picked up my phone and called the cops, who pulled up in front of his driveway like 10 minutes later, had a 10 minute conversation with him after which he quickly carried the speaker inside his garage. His family seems to be scared of me now, as when I came home from work yesterday his wife saw me and instantly told her kids who were playing in the driveway to come close lol. AITA?"

She doesn’t think it’s a big deal because I’m meeting with another friend anyways, so she thinks she can come whenever.

"This morning I made the highest upvoted meme I have ever made. It said “when you see a meme in new and forget to upvote but then it appears again in hot” and it was a screen grab from a movie where someone was hugging another and saying “I thought I’d lost you, boy”

The post was the removed from the subreddit (r\ memes) because it mentioned upvotes. Yes that’s right, because it mentioned the word upvote. I thought this was unfair because I believed that the the reason of the rule must have been to prevent karma whoring and therefore my meme which was simply a meta meme about reddit was unfairly grouped into this by the rule which was too broad and maybe should be adjusted. 

I wrote my opinion in a polite manner, similar to above and they responded rudely saying:

>Did you read the rule before tou you wrote half of war and peace arguing against it?

I was shocked and responded saying I did, and re-explained my opinion on why the rule was unfair and how I hoped to understand the reason for the rule in the first place to better understand the situation so I knew exactly what type of posts the sub wanted to prevent with the rule.

They copy and pasted the words from the rule stating that it can’t mention upvotes and made it in big text and said

>Can you see it better now?

I was shocked again and responded saying I wanted to know the purpose of the rule.

They said to prevent karma whoring so I responded explaining that I understood why the rule is there now, yet I still stood by the fact that my post is not karma whoring in anyway and therefore I believed that the rule could maybe be adjusted to be more fair and less broad as I believe it unfairly grouped my meme as it was in no way karma whoring and I thanked them for the time.

Next they muted me from the sub and talking to the mods...

"So recently I got a new job at a clothing store after months of searching and one of the first people I told was my housemate/best friend. At first she was okay with it and was very excited about the discounts I could get her but then when she found out about how much I get paid hourly (I know I probably shouldn’t have told her in the first place), she got really bitter about it. 

I’ve only told a few people about my new job and if she’s around when I do, she will complain about how annoying it is that I’m getting paid the same amount as her when apparently “I don’t even need to use my brain to work and all I gotta do at work is fold clothes”. For context, we’re both students and she works as a cashier/pharmacy assistant. 

A few times when I couldn’t make it to some of our hangouts with our friends for work, she’ll say things like “why don’t you just take the time off? It’s just retail anyway!” Or ask me why I’m taking this job so seriously when it’s not even related to the course I’m studying. 

She also gets weird about the way I spend my money. I really enjoy makeup so I’ll buy myself a few items each month and she’d go around telling people how I have no self-control and that I have a spending issue even when I explained to her that I have a budget on how much I’m allowing myself to spend on my hobbies. 

Now I’ve told before her that the things she said about me or my job are really unfair. She just brushed it off and continues making fun of my job and each time I have an early start (we start as early as 7am) she’s mockingly tell me how she feels bad for me and say things like how she’s so lucky she starts at 9am and don’t have to fold clothes yada yada. I’ve also recently found out from another friend that she told people I’m working so hard to earn money because I’m in a “pathetic” LDR and I have to fly to another country just to see my SO and convinced my friend to not invite me to a trip because I’ll be working or would want to fly to my SO anyway.

c23jjt	2019-06-18 15:22:03	MaddysinLeigh	AITA for wanting to confront my neighbor and being pissed at my mother?	"So I’ve been in Hawaii visiting my sister and bil for nearly two weeks along with my parents. My mom insisted on having a neighbor take care of my guinea pig, Oreo, instead of boarding him. Some background on my neighbor, she means well but she’s not the brightest crayon in the cookie box. We had her watch my previous guinea pig, Snowball, for a few days and the neighbor gave Snowball beef jerky that was in the fridge because we had her veggies in the fridge too (they were on a different shelf than the beef jerky). So needless to say I wasn’t very confident in the neighbor’s ability to care for Oreo for nearly two weeks. I tried convincing my mom to board him at his vet even though it would cost $200+ per week not including the extra bedding, food, and other necessities we’d have to get for him.

Here’s a list of what she was asked to do and what she actually did;
- we give him vitamin c drops as guinea pigs cannot produce it on their own and therefore scurvy and other related issues are a real issue. We knew she wouldn’t be able to give him the drops so we got him a treat that is a vitamin c supplement. The bag was not even opened.
- every other day empty the bedding in his cage and on the days she didn’t cover the wet spots with fresh bedding. She literally stacked wet bedding on wet bedding only using a quarter of ONE bag of bedding out of the four we provided her. For perspective, I usually go through an entire bag of bedding every 2-3 days. To make matters worse when I cleaned out his cage there was a dead roach in it.
- give him a handful of dry food every day as he will eat a handful of it a day. There was barely any of his food gone and his dish was empty. Oreo looks thinner, feels significantly lighter, and has loose skin around his belly.
- give his 1-2 treats a day and the bag of treats is almost gone when it would have lasted me for over a month.

In addition he’s super skittish which means she most likely did not interact with him more than giving him food and adding more bedding to his cage. Guinea pigs are social animals and most people buy pairs. I have had two prior guinea pigs and have never paired them because me and my family interact with them quite a bit.

I complained to my mom and she defended our neighbor, because Oreo “isn’t dead,” and she’s blaming me for not being clear enough in my instructions. She’s also acting like I’m being dramatic and that I should just let it go, even laughing at some of the mistakes our neighbor made. 

So am I the asshole for wanting to confront the neighbor and get an explanation as to why she completely fucked up my instructions? And am I the asshole for being pissed at my mom for defending our neighbor and trying to downplay the severity of the situation?"	Not enough info	0	0

They are here a week early just to spend time with us and to visit us for the first time at a new house we bought recently.

We have a pool and the temperatures have been basically scorching for the past couple of weeks.

Apparently this is something my SIL isn't comfortable with and get this ... not for herself, but for her parents sake. 

She told me, through my brother once and directly in a heated conversation how some of my wife's behavior is a little beneath her age and disrespectful to our guests. What is this behavior you ask? That she sunbathes, sometimes topless, around the pool which is a good thirty yards away from the house, on it's own corner of the property. That she sometimes spends time in her bathing suit at home when she's hopping in and out. And this is what got me almost to rage at her .. that apparently she has the audacity not to maybe wear an annoying bra when it's nearly 100F outside for a place and a house designed to be getting no more than 70-85F even in summers (yes, we live in coastal CA). 

I lost my cool, called her a perv, then later apologized to my brother and her but told her that any more comments and she's not welcome to stay here anymore. Her parents, being old, and polite through this, can definitely stay.

&#x200B;

I was surprised when I arrived to find a white unmarked SUV in my driveway. I didn't know who it could be and the only thought I had was that it was potentially the pest control company I use, because my Realtor had let me know that she was meeting them that morning to let them inspect for the termite letter. They drive white vehicles but theirs are all usually marked with the company logo. It was still odd that she wasn't there but I thought perhaps she'd let them in to do the inside then left while they finished the outside stuff.

&#x200B;

So, I parked at the rd and opened my garage and started walking towards the house to investigate, when an African American man comes walking out of my backyard wearing an A&M Police shirt. As he got closer I saw that it said A&M Chief of Police. 

Him: I was just checking out the backyard.   
Me: Why?  
Him: It's for sale, there's a sign.  
Me: Actually it's sold. The sign says pending.   
Him: Oh, well I'm trying to find a house to buy.

Me: Good luck with that.  


I was rather short with him because I just wanted him gone. Looking back I wish I'd pointed out that just because there's a sign in the yard it's not an invitation to trespass.  


He finally leaves and I go on with getting things ready for the movers. When I posted about this on FB my Realtor sent me a picture/info for the A&M Police Chief and asked if it was him. It definitely could be but I couldn't be 100% certain as the guy in the pic looked younger. She suggested calling and reporting it but I feel like it'd be a bit of an ahole thing to do since I didn't get the car tag and can't be 100% that it was him. I considered calling the Campus Chief and asking if he's the guy looking for property in my neighborhood to verify then if so, reporting him.

"Last summer I cheated on my now ex boyfriend, I did a terrible thing and I wish I could go back and undo it, and I think I’m going to feel awful about it for the rest of my life, but I ended up telling him and then we broke up shortly after. My best friend at the time (let’s call her Mary) knew about this all along because she was the only person I trusted with my secret, we had been friends for over 14 years and we had what I thought a lovely friendship by sharing interests and being there for eachother when needed (we met gaming online then we became friends IRL). My ex boyfriend at the time of the break-up (while I already talked to him about the cheating and I was already breaking up with him!) asked her details about it, and she told him basically everything about the affair for no reason at all, other than her being an awful friend and somehow wanting to get back at me over some form of jealousy or whatnot. She even denied it and lied to my face about it, and she only owned up to it after our mutual friend (let’s call him John) met up with her and probably told her that I knew she was the one who told my ex every little detail.

I had to cut ties with her,she didn’t even give me a sincere apology and blamed me for what happened in our friendship, then proceeded to hurt me by contacting some of our mutual friends and trying to make me look like a monster and even made up lies about me. 

Our friend John struggled to be in such a position, but it hurt me a lot to see that when I told him what she had done he basically minimized it and made it look less important that what it actually was, and somehow their friendship stayed the same (she doesn’t have any other friends). 
Through all these months I distanced myself from him, not on purpose, but I just can’t help it and be friends with someone who is still as close as before to her. I know that maybe it’s “immature” to pick sides or whatever, but even after addressing what was wrong in our friendship he said he cared for both equally and didn’t wanna lose my friendship either. I never contact him first, he sometimes does and “complains” that we rarely talk and see eachother anymore.

While I’m a bit more of a wallflower A-student, she’s a pretty well-known and well-liked student but she can also struggle a bit in class especially when it comes to time management. 

So anyway due to grad school we essentially only get a very small break in the summer, and she wants to work on her house the entire time. Fair enough, I think that’s great, but at the same time I know she’s really been working herself hard the past few weeks so i've been trying to encourage her to at least just take one day completely off to relax. She can overwork herself and although she has a hard time seeing it, I have definitely seen how ragged she can run herself. She does plan to take time off for a few days around the fourth of july, but it's in the middle of classes and I just feel it's not a great idea based on past similar incidents. Plus she often gets distracted from doing work which then makes her stressed for not having done work, and I figure if she just commits to taking the time off she won’t feel as guilty and she’ll probably still even end up doing a little work and may even feel a bit ahead. Beyond this, I also worry that when classes pick up she’ll get stressed and end up canceling her plans. Our field is very prone to burnout and I just genuinely worry that she’s putting too much pressure on herself without taking time to breath.

Well I spent the night at her place and I guess in hindsight I did keep bringing up how she should take time off, but when she would dismiss it, it always felt a bit more like a casual and lighthearted dismissal than a legitimate “No, I really can’t do that” type dismissal which is why I kept insisting. Even at that I wasn’t being pushy, but more so jokeful about how she could take the time off. So she eventually snapped at me saying ""Well maybe I know whats best for me, huh?"" And I’ve been feeling really shitty since then, because I really wasn't trying to imply that I know what’s best for her, and beyond that I guess I just didn't realize that it was such a legit issue for her, I was just trying to encourage her not to wear herself down and the actual break we have would be better for relaxing than in the middle of class.

I guess at the end of the day I know I shouldn’t have been so insistent on taking a day off, but I still do feel she’s putting herself in a rough spot that may backfire.

c23da2	2019-06-18 15:07:33	callumad1	AITA for sleeping in while living at home with my family?	" 

I’m almost 19, and have just returned from a gap year, I’m about to move on to university in September. For about three years now, I have had real problems with getting to sleep, at least before 4am. I have tried and tried to sleep earlier, away from any lights or technology, making sure I wake up early, no caffeine, no food late at night, nothing. The only thing that seems to work for me is smoking... but that's another story about another argument with my parents. 

While I was away, both my parents retired/lost their jobs. So they're at home all the time, and constantly on my back about helping out in the house and doing chores and getting a job... even though they themselves can't find a job, I'm saying this not to belittle them, just showing how hard it is to find work here when my parents have 3 degrees between them and have been searching for months. 

I mentioned my struggles of late sleep because of this, I have never been able to sleep in, I was always doing something like playing in matches or some odd jobs or at school and now these past 3 weeks I have been sleeping in, maybe from 0400hrs-1300hrs and it has changed my life. I wake up with so much energy, which never used to happen, I feel myself getting stronger at the gym, my spots are going away, and I feel a lot more focused, like if I had only now sobered up from a 3 year long drunkenness. 

For me, this is great, I feel like a new man. But my parents are absolutely losing their Sh1t about how disrespectful it is that I sleep in, they're taking care of me and feeding me and helping me out with Uni, which of course I'm extremely grateful for, and apparently I'm throwing it all back in their face by sleeping in. When I've explained how much this normal sleeping amount is changing me, making me feel so much happier mentally and physically, they just laugh and tell me that when my sister and I were kids they got next to no sleep and that I should suck it up. 

When I ask what they would want me to be doing if I were to be waking up earlier, they say I should be helping out around the house, which really annoys me because that's exactly what I do, just maybe 3 hours later than they want me to. 

It really upsets me because I feel like I'm doing absolutely nothing wrong by getting some extra sleep, just for this summer too because I will not be living at home ever again, and I'm still doing everything they ask of me, more too. 

On the other hand, they are seriously helping me out with Uni fees and stuff, I wouldn't be able to go without their help, and I know they're looking to go back to work to help my sister through uni in a few years too. So I feel terrible for angering them so much over such a small thing as waking up 3 hours earlier. 

TL:DR I have been sleeping in a lil bit to make up for the crazy time I go to sleep at, and my parents are mad about it because I'm not doing chores early enough, even though it makes no difference at all."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c23d93	2019-06-18 15:07:31		AITA for getting mad about my GF(19) short attention span and making her cry	"When we first started dating(kind of a trial run) she was on her phone 24 7 even during movies(it was empty so wasnt distracting anyone).  I shouldve called her out on it back then but once we started dating for real it stopped.  

However, last night we were on a little date and I was telling a short 2 minute story but in the middle of that she cut me off to not only add something but start saying her own thing.  Now, when you fo that what do you usually do?  You say""sorry, go on"" or something like that.  Well not her, its ""sorry!!! you know I have a short attention span!"". But she only says this after I point out what she did. 

Well understandably I'm frustrated but I dont take it out on her I just keep walking and tell her she can continue cause I don't feel like finishing my thing.  This isnt the first time shes done this.  Well, she started crying quietly vecause apparently I hate her and dont like spending time with her cause of how I act.  Like yeah, i told you exactly why I'm frustrated but you wont take responsibility for being rude.  This ends with me having to apologize ofcourse and make her not feel like shit. 

This has happened before and caused an argument because I told her to either get a diagnosis and get herself fixed or actually acknowledge when shes rude and act like a normal human in this scenario.  Couldve chosen nicer words but this isnt a one time thing.

c23cra	2019-06-18 15:06:25		AITA for telling the girl I like that I prefer other body types to hers?	"Throwaway account because I don't want this on my main.

&#x200B;

So, I am in a really confusing situation right now. I met this really amazing girl some months ago, we texted a lot, met, shared stuff and we both liked each other so we kept on talking and doing the same. Keep in mind that I've never felt this much attraction to any girl, that I like her more than I've liked any other girl, ever.

This happened yesterday. We were texting and I don't remember how the topic came up but this wasn't uncalled-for. I basically told her that I liked other body types more than her body, that her body appearance wouldn't exactly fit my tastes (it's the truth and I didn't think she would get offended, because she knows how I feel about her). She exercises and is a really attractive and pretty girl, no doubt, and I am attracted to her excellent physical appearance a ton (and she knows, because I've told her numerous times how good she looks) but I also have in mind her personality. If she didn't have the amazing personality she has, I feel I wouldn't feel attracted. I don't think I can't be this attracted to a girl with a personality I don't like or a personality that's not even half as good as hers. Looks are important, but to me (and I guess to many people) personality is far more important than looks and I can't be just attracted to a body.

Now she, to my honest surprise, took offense. She got really mad with me and told me to look for girls that fitted my tastes. I tried to fix it by saying I explained myself poorly (I still think I did) but then she said that she didn't want to listen to me, that she didn't care and that I should just forget it and shut up. I told her that I find and found her attractive, just that I also like other types of women, not just her body type. She answered that she had shared with me very private and personal things that she hadn't done with anyone else, and that what I said really hurt. I hated myself for this, I really hurt her feelings and I felt awful, so I told her I was sorry multiple times and tried to fix it. She told me to stop and we haven't talked since.

I kept reflecting on what had happened and I came to the conclusion that I still think the same. Her body, to me, is not the perfect body the girl of my dreams has, but her personality is so good I don't even care how good or bad her body might be (and as I said, she is not even ugly or has an unattractive body, I love her body).

So, AITA? I feel really bad for having hurt her feelings, but on the other side I think I've been honest with how I feel and she shouldn't take offense, maybe I was too honest and I shouldn't have said that.

I had an interview yesterday for a job and one today for a PhD program - both in similar fields. The company that interviewed me yesterday gave me a job offer with the slight reservation that they were worried I'd leave early to do a PhD - I'd said during the interview that I'd been applying to PhDs and had been unsuccessful. I didn't lie or omit information. They knew I had another interview the next day but the nice HR lady made a point not to ask where or what for. During the phone call today, HR said that I needed to think it over and give her an answer tomorrow. HR also mentioned that they would be looking to promote me after a year because of my knowledge and experience in the field already.

The PhD interview went as well as I could hope. I'll find out about the PhD in a couple of weeks but it's a great project with 2 very friendly supervisors and my girlfriend would be in the year above me at that uni so it's 100% my first choice if I get it. I'm competing for university funding not for the project so having 2 supervisors on board is good but not a guarantee that I will be successful. It starts in September.

I could do with the money, experience and connections so personally, a short term employment would be good for me.

c23a1k	2019-06-18 15:00:32	DreamingShimmer	AITA for cutting my mum out of my life?	"It has been a couple of years since I have started a new life in a large city. This started due to homelessness as I had to get away from my mother. After I was awarded two UK social security benefits (PIP and ESA), my mum borrowed £300 out of what was back paid for the delays in the benefits. I wanted to use this money for college supplies (I was doing architecture at the time), which she begrudgingly allowed. Although, I heard about it for the next month as she'd complained that I was wasting the money. After she borrowed the money, I went to stay with a friend, packing nothing but seven changes of clothes and other essentials. I was on very limited contact terms with her at the time

After I was temporarily housed in the city by the council (and bidding for a permanent place to live), my communications with her I cut off completely. She tried to dig up stuff about me by demanding my old therapist's email address from the staff that work at the therapy centre I see my current psychologist at. When staff wouldn't give my old therapist's email address, she began spamming me with messages.

I got back in touch with her in December of the same year as she had to give our cat away due to vet bills she could not afford and neither could I. We had a somewhat decent relationship with ups and downs up until nearly a month ago. I had dealt with a horrible incident when I was 13, and she knew about it. So, when something similar happened when I was at a university psychology ball about a month ago, she wouldn't stop talking about herself. I feel like such an asshole for wanting support at the time rather than giving her support through her arthritic pain. She told me that her co-worker was more like a daughter to her as she was kind and helpful. I do have a lot of things on my plate: artwork for an exhibition, studying for resits at university and working towards selling little bits of jewellery. I'm not exactly free all the time to make calls she should be making herself.

About a week or so ago, she kept shouting at me just because she could not follow instructions to connect her wireless printer to WiFi as she had just moved house. Then, a few days later, I called to tell her about me beginning volunteering within the NHS. 40 minutes of an about 45 minute call was spent discussing her arthritis and her not really accepting that there are ways to manage it apart from painkillers.

Am I the asshole for cutting her out of my life? Am I the asshole for warning her that I will file for a restraining order against her if she contacts me again? Am I the asshole for expecting support when she needs support? I feel conflicted, especially with many friends telling me that I should be talking to her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I did this to my grandfather last night as well as other times. He was telling me a story about his time in the Vietnam war, which I'm actually fascinated by, and he said something that made me drift off into another world. By the end of his story he asked whether or not I agree and I just took a shot in the dark and said yes. He didn't seem to notice that I wasn't paying attention and luckily saying yes worked. While I was off in another world, I was still making eye contact with him making it seem like I actually was paying attention. I feel bad because I do this more than I like to admit.

c238br	2019-06-18 14:56:19	redbandit87	WIBTA for reporting my electrician for hitting on our nanny?	"We had some renovations going on in our home over the course of the last couple of months.  Often times there would be workers in the home at the same time that our nanny was there watching our two young kids.  The last time I spoke to the electrician he had just finished his work and he brought up that his daughter was looking for a nanny for his two young kids on the weekends and would it be possible for him to get our nanny's contact information.  He showed me pictures of his grandkids and everything.  I asked her about it and she said sure, so I sent him her info.

&#x200B;

The work is now finished and a couple of weeks later it turns out that the electrician's only motivation was to ask her out.  I don't have full details of exactly what he said, but it just came across as kind of creepy.  She is much younger than him (late 30s while he could be easily 60+) and is married with kids.  To be fair he probably did not know about that.  Beyond being creepy, he deceived me in my own home.  This is really where my main issue lies.  Had he just been truthful with me in the first place I could have put a stop to it and everyone could have gone on their merry way.

&#x200B;

So, WIBTA for taking it to the next level and reporting him to our contractor that hired him, potentially getting him in trouble or losing work over this?  I feel like it was very unprofessional of him.  At a minimum he won't be welcome back in our home.  So far he has not pushed things beyond her original rejection, but if he gets persistent or starts harassing her then I would definitely be more likely to say something.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Spoke to the contractor that hired the electrician.  I explained what happened and that once our nanny had requested the electrician to stop contacting her that he had respected her wishes.  I did not make any demands beyond that the electrician not return to our home.  Contractor apologized and said it was highly unprofessional and that he would not be using the electrician for any future projects.  He also thanked us for making him aware of the situation.

A long time friend of mine, calling her Madeline for anonimnity, has a boyfriend she's been with for about a year now. She and I have been super close for like 6 years. I get on really well with her bf and we've even hung out without her a few times now, but tonight he kinda stepped over a boundary and idk which one of us is TA here now.


Basically, he joked about taking us out to maccas at like 10:30pm and Madeline and I were keen, but he said he was kidding cause he has work at 7am, so I decided I'd take Madeline out to maccas just the two of us cause we got keen after it was brought up. While we're out, he messages asking if we can buy and bring him a shake, so I drive us to maccas and then out to his place, and then back to our suburb to chill in the car (Madeline and I often spend hours in the middle of the night just chatting and we love it, so that was the plan for the next few hours). He starts messaging her saying he wishes she would come over and he asks her to go get her car then come back to his for the night, even though he'd be leaving her alone in the morning anyway. Then, the bit that really annoyed me, he actually messaged me asking me to drive her home to get her car or drive her to his place so she could spend the night with him instead. Madeline didn't want to, and she had already told him that, but he claimed to me that she was ""too polite"" to tell me, despite the fact that she's definitely not.


I told him I wasn't gonna cut our time short for him, and that next time maybe he can make plans with her before I have, rather than after, and now Madeline and I are both a bit annoyed that he seemed to think he was the priority and that he had more right to see her than I did, and she ended up going home early anyway just to go to sleep because he was making her really anxious, but now he's annoyed that she didn't just drop everything to sleep in his bed, and that I didn't play along despite her wishes and mine. I get where he's coming from, I often wish I could see my boyfriend when he's busy, I know what it's like to not want to sleep alone, but I've never actually tried to step in.

A few weeks go by and I get sick of it so I tell him that if he doesn't stop then I will tell his girlfriend what he is saying about Ashley, he gets mad and tells me not to tell her so I think he would stop, but I was sadly mistaken.  He kept talking and I kept warning him but he didnt listen so then he tells me that him and his gf broke up for no reason but he just lost feelings for and that he only dated her becausr he felt sorry for her, and then I found out that he was talking bad about me behind my back, calling me gay and telling people that I am dating a guy and of course because he had a reputation as a popular kid some people listened but others came to ask me what actually happened so I told them everything that happened and then they spread what I said to other people so eventually we ended up ending our friendship and he got even worse and started making up rumors about me saying that I masturbate, pick my nose, and saying that I have A crush on everyone.  All of those are not true and some people started to notice it. I told his ex, EVERYTHING amd she got super mad and went off on him.

The whole trip was planned a little more than a month prior to now. One of my “friends” texted me earlier saying how me canceling messes up the plan completely, and that she’s pissed to have to deal with all this trouble. She also said that she was disappointed in me for backing out, as well as for promising to be able to go. I have lost their trust, and I know that a screwed them over, but I told them sorry for troubling them many times and that I would pay them back for the costs (should i still need to pay for my part of the airbnb costs?). I didn’t cancel for no reason though.
Recently my close cousin had died from a car accident on a vacation trip to Japan. I have no clue as to how it all happened, and i’m waiting to hear an update. Because of this, my parents begged me not to go on our trip. Because I am still dependent on them, I don’t really have a choice. My parents are super protective of me, as this would’ve my first time on a trip without any supervisors, and it honestly surprised me that they said yes in the first place. I think what worries them even more was they asked me if I had wanted to go on the trip with my cousin. I said no fyi. If it helps anymore, my cousin was very close to us, in that my parents treated him as if he were there own son. My cousin was supposed to fly over to us and go on a road trip together next week as well. I thought I had all the time in the world to spend with him, and now I find out that I can’t anymore. Now my parents are on edge, and worried that I’d get in an accident. I already told them that we wouldn’t be driving, and that we’d be using services like lyft or uber, but even then they are are scared. and now I am too.
To add more to this jumbled mess, they aren’t even my friends. I know only one person in the group who invited me. She invited me on the trip (even though she’s kind of reserved? super nice tho), trusting that I would not cancel. AITA? I said i’d pay them back my portion of the costs.

tl;dr I had to cancel a planned trip even though I committed to going b/c of my parents worrying for me."	Asshole	0	0

The books I bought ended up costing me about 40 bucks in total and with a gift card like 28 bucks. I had about 25 bucks in my wallet and still needed to payoff the final 3 dollars left. The cashier, who was very friendly and all told me I could take 4 dollars off, I didnt feel like using my debit card so I applied to the stupid little membership thinking I wouldnt have to use my debit card because thats how she worded it ""you can get an extra 4 dollars off your purchase if you sign up"". So I did it without knowing that the membership I had signed up for cost money, how much money 25 whole dollars. Because of fear for looking like an idiot and wasting her time, (because im a reasonable human and didnt feel like speaking up due to pressure) bought the dumb thing, yeah I got 4 dollars off, but they took home 21 dollars. I thought it was free to sign up, you know something you join and forget about but its okay because you got a discount that one time. I looked up the price of the books this morning because I was a little ticked off that the cashier... ""abused"" he situation using pressure to not hold up the line and make me feel like an asshole. Anyways the prices were super drastic, not the 30 cent diffrence I said, more like 3-8 dollar diffrence, and im buying a set of the books because I quite enjoy the books, which is about a 60 or so dollar diffence when I buy the set online as compared to  like 20 dollars each at the store, my question is, am I an aashole for wanting to go back and get my money back and voiding a membership if I didnt know cost money? she was really nice and all, but its not her fault that the whole collection is cheaper than getting 3 books from barnes and noble.. and at the time I didnt have the courage to tell the cashier no to the membership because I felt pressured to do it since I said I wanted to do it so why say ""oh nevermind and waste the cashiers time""."

i'm pretty sure the biggest factor in this is my parents. when i was younger, like, from when i was 6 (or younger, i cant remember) to around 10, my mom would spank me as a punishment. one time she hit me so hard with the back of a comb that it bruised and i couldn't sit down without it hurting for a couple days and even now i cant stop thinking about it.

I feel like she has gotten somewhat better though. she's stopped hitting me, she's at least *tried* to listen to what i think would make it better, but she still yells at me a lot. when i cry and express how i feel, she yells at me and tells me that i can't feel this way and if anyone should feel this way, it should be her. my dad agrees with me that her reactions are over the top but he gets where shes coming from. i'm pretty sure that it's just a product of how she's been raised, as i'm sure her parents have done that too and for much longer. and she's from the phillippines and she often tells this story about how she was encouraged by her dad to fight one of her eight sisters with machetes. not sure what that has to do with it, i just thought it'd be relevant.

I feel like i've gotten worse about it too. I have a really hard time talking to her, whenever she asks me how i feel i push her away. i avoid serious topics with her because im really afraid shes gonna flip her shit and yell at me for hours. we've been having discussions about where i'll be going to school since i've been in this expensive private school for three years now and i havent advanced a single grade, and every time the topic comes up i avoid it. i know i shouldnt but i never know what to say and it makes me feel like shit.

i had a huge argument with her about it today, telling her that i didnt want to go to school and the only thing that would make me feel better is for her to get the hell out of my life. that made her cry a whole lot and i feel really bad about it. i've already apologized somewhat for what i've said and i just need to get this out there, i guess. Am i the asshole in this situation? are we both the assholes? is it neither of us? please help, reddit :("		1	0

I moved away from home finally moving out of the parents house and in with my bf who I was dating for 3 years at the time. After a year living together he came to the conclusion that he doesn’t see a life with me so he broke it off. I only moved to his area for him. I didn’t want to be in the area anymore so I found a job close to the rest of my family but I didn’t save well while away and the area I’m moving to is far more expensive cost of living wise than current.

Shes from Russia (just for maybe cultural context). Now, we live in a big city and were not struggling by any means... we both work but she makes maybe half of what i make. We live together and split rent (but i pay more), Split vacations a little more (maybe she pays a third towards vacas), but I pay for everything else - from cable, food, taxis, meals out to everything we do when were together. In recent past, shes had some bills and things and I even send money to her parents bc she has cash flow issues. Nothing material just a few hundred every few months, but the point is shes not swimming in cash.

Now, in advance of our wedding (we haven't explicitly discussed splitting costs but I assume ill be paying like 2/3 of it), she says ""i got you a wedding gift"".

So this gift arrives and its an Art piece, a lithograph from a very famous old painter. It has some significance bc we both kinda like the artist, went to the museum etc. so

1. She says 'its very symbolic, his wife was Russian also.' Now, if you read his biography they had a dysfunctional relationship, she cheated on him a lot and he was obsessed with her. , so i dont think its a great symbolic piece.
2. I also infer shes spent like $4-6k on this. Its more than I've ever spent on any one thing apart from a car, and her ring. I love watches but maybe ive bought second hand watches for $3500 but not more.
3. this was portrayed as a gift 'for me'. But its not something i would have ever bought myself. In fact, I remember shes mentioned wanting / buying a print before and i said i wouldn't buy that. I would have to do a lot of research to make sure about market value, resale etc to spend so much. So its very clearly a gift for herself (Im sure in her mind its for us really, she does this always with gifts - couples massage, experiences, etc. It doesn't bother me so much but this time it did). Im not sure but I assume Ill have to get her one now..

I, on the other hand am very much not(but she thinks I kind of am). I will be moving in with my Boyfriend soon, and my mom and family are happy and fine about it. However, none of us have said anything to my sister, and we all agreed she will be very upset. She is older and I know she will lecture me and always try to convince me not to. 

AITA for not wanting to have a hostile conversation with my sister? I feel like it definitely be worse if she finds out and everyone else already knew. 
Also- when I was 18 I promised I save myself for marriage even though I already lost my virginity. We were in a long car ride and I didn’t want to sit in a hostile environment for hours. I know I shouldn’t lie but like I was 18 and didn’t wanna deal with hostility. 

I know it sounds trivial but I love her very much. Does it make me an asshole for lying to her when everyone else knows the truth?"		1	0

I have this super shitty roommate. There's three of us in the apartment, the other guy is fine, but this guy, who I didn't know too well when we signed the lease, ended up being a pretty big degenerate. (Lesson to everyone looking for roommates, do your research on these people first). He has quickly descended on a path of very destructive alcoholism. He's not even old enough to buy it , but his fraternity brothers are purchasing it for him for some reason. He ended up, over the past month or so, committing multiple crimes including a DUI and some other crimes that are against the rules of IATA to mention, but are pretty heinous in my opinion. And for those wondering, I have took this up with our landlord, but our apartment is run by a large company and apparently they cant evict him if the crime didn't happen on their property. Dumb/

&#x200B;

He hung out with a few of my friends and I the past year, and following finding out about these crimes we told him he was not welcome to hang out with us anymore. He responded to this by going on a long rant about how I was the one responsible for his alcoholism and mental health issues. This is a common theme for him, and I was just the next target in a long line of people who he blames for his condition. We haven't talked sense this happen, as he said some extremely hurtful things and actually caused me to take some days off from school and go home for a few days, as I was not comfortable being in that apartment whatsoever. Since I returned, I have not talked to him.

&#x200B;

The next weekend, when I was back in the apartment, I got a call from one of our mutual friends, and he informed me that my roommate told him he broke into one of our friends houses in the middle of the night and stole some bottles of alcohol and shoes? while extremely drunk. I contacted my friends (who were previously unaware that he broke in) and they confirmed the items were missing. My roommate hadn't been home for a while, so I decided I'd just go look in his room and see if I could find anything. His door was unlocked, and sure enough, the alcohol and shoes were sitting on the floor by his bed. I took them back and gave them back to our friends at their request.

&#x200B;

I'm feeling some guilt for going into his room. We defined early on our expectations as roommates and not doing that was one of the conditions. AITA for that? Sorry, approaching the character limit so cant give to much more context.

So at 6th grade camp I caught feelings for a girl and everyone found out because some people eavesdropped and told others so I got the girls number and we will call her Ashley, and the antagonists are, Nico, Gio, Jorge, Jake.


So Nico started changing from nice to toxic through a time frame of 5 weeks but I didn't think much of it as it was only 2 days, but Nico caught feelings for Ashley best friend and they started dating (I managed to get both of them to show their feelings and talk to each other)
So Nico was happy for me cause I got Ashley's number.  During everything he was supportive. When we got back from camp( 5 days in)
Everything was different, my friends didnt want to hang out as much and they started laughing at me for no reason and me and my friend Ezekiel noticed that Nico always seemed mad at me for something.  So when I asked him what's wrong , he said its because Ashley is a guy (She isn't)

I have been living with my boyfriend for 5 years and we both work full time, although I make very little money compared to him. We never made a joint account for stuff like groceries in part because we're too lazy to do so and also because we like eating different things and never share meals together. 

I never buy sweets or unhealthy food, but sometimes when I see that he has some lying around I'll steal a biscuit, piece of chocolate or yoghurt. I don't eat up ALL of his stuff but yes, I do eat some of it and it pisses him off like crazy. He says it's not the cost of it that bothers him but the fact that he buys this stuff for himself and that he comes home and expects to have them in the fridge and often finds none. As a result, he has taken to hiding all his food in shelves where I can't reach or somewhere I won't find them. As for why I don't buy sweets for myself if I like them so much, I do very often do so, but sometimes I have none and I'll take some from him. 

TL;DR: I never buy junk food and sometimes eat some of my boyfriend's - this pisses him off, he thinks I'm an asshole and now hides all his food from me like I'm the cookie monster."	Asshole	1	0

A bit of a background. I myself have depression and borderline personality disorder. You know, the kind that makes me push people away and I'm bad at maintaining relationships. 

My girlfriend, has anxiety and depression, and she says she has PTSD and ADHD. I say she says cause only the first two are diagnosed. 

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a better part of a year. We've had our ups and downs and they swing quite at full force.

--

My girlfriend started smoking weed with me and makes it clear that she doesn't want anyone to know. I've had to drop my weed friends because she was against weed at the time. The only people that know that we smoke, is my mom and her fiancee.

So three weeks ago, we go to my older sisters and my sister tells a story that insist she knows we smoke.

So after that, my girl called my mom a bit aggressive asking her about that (cause mom knows that she doesn't want people to know). Then she storms out the car and I'm a bit uneasy.

So I go to my sister and talk to her and to my girlfriends credit, that's a bad idea cause my sister likes to add fuel to the fire.

So then my sister and girlfriend argue back and forth and I just do nothing cause I don't want to pick sides. My girlfriend is pissed at me, yet she disrespected my mom and what not.

So skipping the rest, I apologized for getting my sister involved and we moved on. She said she doesn't want to see my older sister whatsoever and yesterday was the first test of that.

I go to my younger sisters graduation and my older sister is going so my girl decides to stay. There was an extra ticket but we left it in case she changed her mind.

When I get back from the event, my girl says she doesn't want and talk about what has her in a bad mood and then says it's my family and the whole thing that happened with the older sister.

This isn't the first time she brings up old problems after everyone else has moved on.

Quick example is I used to smoke weed with my friends behind her back and we spoke about it, apologized and I even dropped them as friends for her.

I ask this cause I don't know if I'm an ass for not caring because it's been dealt with."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c22qzf	2019-06-18 14:13:34		AITA for wanting a refund	"So I was at the barnes and noble yesterday and I was buying some books to read, I hadnt checked amazon because I thought the price diffrence between buying online and buying in store was like a 30 cent diffrence, which I would be okay with I also had a giftcard that I randomly found. The books I bought ended up costing me about 40 bucks in total and with a gift card like 28 bucks.

I had about 25 bucks in my wallet and still needed to payoff the final 3 dollars left. The cashier, who was very friendly and all told me I could take 4 dollars off, I didnt feel like using my debit card so I applied to the stupid little membership thinking I wouldnt have to use my debit card because thats how she worded it ""you can get an extra 4 dollars off your purchase if you sign up""

So I did it without knowing that the membership I had signed up for cost money, how much money 25 whole dollars. Because of fear for looking like an idiot and wasting her time, (because im a reasonable human and didnt feel like speaking up due to pressure) bought the dumb thing, yeah I got 4 dollars off, but they took home 21 dollars. I thought it was free to sign up, you know something you join and forget about but its okay because you got a discount that one time...

I looked up the price of the books this morning because I was a little ticked off that the cashier... ""abused"" he situation using pressure to not hold up the line and make me feel like an asshole. Anyways the prices were super drastic, not the 30 cent diffrence I said, more like 3-8 dollar diffrence, and im buying a set of the books because I quite enjoy the books, which is about a 60 or so dollar diffence when I buy the set online as compared to  like 20 dollars each at the store, my question is, am I an aashole for wanting to go back and get my money back and voiding a membership if I didnt know cost money? What would you guys do in a situation like this.  she was really nice and all, but its not her fault that the whole collection is cheaper than getting 3 books from barnes and noble.. and at the time I didnt have the courage to tell the cashier no to the membership because I felt pressured to do it since I said I wanted to do it so why say ""oh nevermind and waste the cashiers time"". I hate cashier pressure but am I an asshole for wanting my money back?"		1	0
c22qwu	2019-06-18 14:13:26	-OnceAgain	AITA for telling my SO I'm not willing to adopt a child of addict parents	"My SO (F27) and I (M28) have been together for 4 years now. I know for a fact that she is not willing to become pregnant herself and I accepted that because I believe we are a good match and I do love her deeply. Afterall it's her body and nobody can force her to put herself through pregnancy. Now even though she wouldn't mind living life without raising a child, I would like to raise one, one day.  So we've been talking about other options.  

As most likely it is going to be one child only, I would prefer to be genetically linked to that child for two main reason. The first is that I would feel more connected to the child and second because I believe my SO and I have a lot to offer genetics-wise.  

My SO, being someone who occasionally hosts stray dogs and cats at our apartment till they rehabilitate and we find them a new home, is looking into the option to adopt a child. She mentioned how children of addict parents have it really tough and even after getting away from their parents their personality is not that easy and untrusting which may result in them changing foster homes multiple times and/or becoming 18 without any. So maybe adopting such a child is something I would consider doing.  

My answer to this was that I'm willing to donate or volunteer in order to help such children but when it comes to raising such a child myself, I don't think I have it in me.  
During the conversation, I mentioned multiple times how a child of our genes pool would probably have a higher potential in my point of view (came out too narcissist, I know) but that's only because I see in myself a lot of what my parents have, intellectual and personality wise (narcissist again?).  
I explained that I'll be putting a lot of time, effort, and money in my child as it's some kind of an investment. It would make me glad to know my child grows up to be a great decent person. And I know that I will accept my biological child as is, no matter what it is like.  
The sad thing is, I can't say that for certain if we adopted a child. And that's not the child's fault, I know, it's all mine. I just can't make that promise. I'm not saying things can't change if that actually happened, I'm just saying it's a risk that I'm not willing to take as the consequences can be too hard to overcome.   
Last thing I mentioned was that if we were to adopt a child, the child's parents (if known) and the environment the child was born into would have a great weight in my decision. I am aware this sounds too much like IATA, but if we're going to raise one child only, I wouldn't make the decision based on which child needs the most help (again sounds like IATA, but I'm just trying to be real with myself here).  

Needless to say, SO did not like my point of view at all. So here I am asking, AITA? And would appreciate if someone who went through something similar can share their story. 

Well, after saying all that I probably should go volunteer somewhere over the weekend to balance out my karma.  

----------------
----------------

EDIT - For the people who didn't like the genetics comments, for all you know I may be the dumbest ugliest person alive, but I am satisfied with my genetics. Whether it is an appearance, personality or an intellectual trait, no matter how good or bad, I would love to be able to say the child got that from me / my SO.  

EDIT - Allow me to try and rephrase my ""investment"" comment. I didn't mean that I'm expecting any kind of return from it. But the opposite, it is an investment in the child's future where the child is the only benefit from it. I merely provide the tools and means in the best way I can so when the time comes to make own decisions, the child will be up for that."	Asshole	0	0

c22qee	2019-06-18 14:12:10	Amidalaya	AITA for not including a friend?	"A little backstory:
I've got two long time friends, we will call them A and S. They were coworkers of mine 10 years ago and we grew a close friendship. Though I'm much closer to S than to A because we are much more alike. A and S are this kind of friends who only have a relationship because they have a mutual friend. S had to move away because of work and we don't see each other as often as we would like but it's always as if we never have been apart. A always gets upset when S comes to visit me and we don't met up with her or I don't tell her about it and she can see if she has time to met up.

A and S are both pregnant and only one month apart, which seems like A to think she is much closer to S now and texts her more frequently - like once every two weeks.
S came to visit me for two days because she wanted to see me before her baby would be born. I told A about it and she wanted the three of us to met up. I told her I would ask S about it and let her know.
When S came I asked her about her plans and if she would like to met up with A. S declined and told me she came to visit me and my kids and not A because she never know what to talk with her and doesn't feel close to her. I texted A and told her S had other plans and apologized - maybe next time.
A texted me something like ""okay. I understand"" and I thought nothing more about it.
A few days later As husband (which I'm also close friends with) texted me about his disappointment about me because A is really sad now and why we couldn't involve A in our plans because she is ""about to give birth"" and can't move much (I was pregnant two times already and A pretends like no one ever was - its her second child - and everyone has bend to her wishes because she is pregnant) and that our selfishness disappointed him and... Well... A lot along those lines.

c22qcx	2019-06-18 14:12:05	GRAHAMPUBA	AITA for engaging one of my Girlfreinds besties on her behalf?	"I have a **G**irl **F**riend with regularly debilitating depression. It reaches into most parts of her life; impostor syndrome, uncertain self image, abandonment issues. Her coping tactics are avoidance, comfort eating and self medication as far as I can interpret. She is awesome when shes not beating herself up and I'm a relatively recent component (4 years) as far as her friends and support group go.  

&#x200B;

This past week, one of her top two **L**ong **T**ime **F**riends posted an image of them with two other mutual friends at some music event years ago. My GF's apparent demeanor in the pic was seemingly unenthused as she is with most picture moments and the LTF commented with posting ""GF looks so enthused"" laugh/cry emoji.. which wasn't off the mark and not done in malice im certain.  But as a few of her tactics have begun to take their toll on her being as of late, GF interpreted it as an affront on her appearance and image and it was enough to send her into or exacerbate a depression cycle to the point where she cancelled her commitments for the remainder of the week. The details of the picture were not revealed to me until a couple days after as she didn't want to talk about and revisit the emotions, so all I knew at the time was a social media pic set her off.

&#x200B;

After seeing this cycle into the third day, I texted the LTF and said '*hey, not sure what the pic was but it got to GF enough that shes cancelled work and still not taking it well.

LTF was outraged and speechless that I would contact her and 'tell her what to do', and it wasn't my place and I was all kinds of out of line by sending her that.  And she did intervene, even after I asked her to hold off if she was determined to, immediately contacting GF which made things even worse.

Yes, GF is hypersensitive and Long Term Friends have been patient and subjected to or witnessed a lot of irrational behavior.

c22oza	2019-06-18 14:08:43	Peachtaylor	AITA for telling my husband that his daughters behavior is his fault?	"My husband has a 5 year old daughter. The first time I met her was a few months ago when she came to stay for the summer. She's a lovely little girl but she has (what I consider) two major habits that bother me:

1) She lies, A LOT. Sometimes about small things sometimes about pretty big things.


2) She cries to get her way, A LOT. I mean screaming at the top of her lungs crying. She'll stop when you leave the room and start when you come back. She doesn't do it to me as much anymore because I won't give her a) the attention she wants or b) the items she wants. She cried so much at one point we had to take her to the ER because her eye was swollen shut for a day.

So the issue is that he'll punish her for lying, but only when it affects him. If it isn't something that matters to him he'll laugh. She literally said ""I told a big lie"" and he laughed at it.

Now when he gets angry over her lying I tell him I don't want to hear it. I've told him she does it because he and her mother let her get away with it and his response is that its normal for a 5 year old to lie and cry this much. I disagree (I also have 2 children). He isn't happy when I say something about her behavior being inappropriate and he isn't happy when I ignore him being angry over that same behavior.

She's going to start kindergarten soon and this behavior isn't going to fly there. I love her and that's why I care. If I didn't love her I wouldn't give a shit.

AITA for telling him that her behavior isn't normal and that it's his (and her mother's) fault she does this?

ETA: I've tried bringing it up gently and offering alternative solutions. I've told him he needs to be consistent. I've told him that this isn't going to work when she gets to kindergarten. I've tried the look of death. I'm kind of done pretending I guess? Even when she put soap in my water cup and I drank it, she blamed it on the dog and he laughed. I don't know what to do anymore.

ETA2: When it comes to how her mom spoils her, he has no problem acknowledging that. But when it comes to him, he wants no part of it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c22o3f	2019-06-18 14:06:35	dont_dox_me_again	AITA for telling my mom she can’t bring a +1 to my wedding?	"I’m a 29 years old male. I have 2 younger brothers and a single mom. Objectively, I had a decent mom. She didn’t drink or do drugs, she worked hard and taught us polite manners, she made sure we started working young, played sports, and stayed in school. My brothers are very upset because recently I haven’t been seeing eye-to-eye with her.

My brothers are technically my half brothers but we’ve never really seen it that way. I didn’t even know until I was about 12. We grew up together in the same household. My mom got pregnant with me at 16 and my dad skipped out before I was even born. My mom remarried when I was 2 and he adopted me and took on a dad role. They got divorced when I was 12 and he maintained a relationship with my brothers (his biological sons) but cut me out. Since then my mom has been divorced twice and was always dating someone else while we were growing up. Whether it be months or years, someone was always around. She married her best friend while partying in Vegas and when he moved in with his 3 daughters we all quickly realized that it wasn’t going to work out and they divorced in 9 months. Shortly after, when I was 16 she introduced me to my biological father. They started dating and went from love to restraining order in a matter of 2 months. She finally married a great guy about 10 years ago but cheated on him with a coworker recently and they just split up. This ex-husband of hers is the man I consider my stepdad.

The issue I'm having is that I’m not trying to relive her same mistakes. I’m about to be getting married myself and it’s really tough to see her consistently treating her SO’s like this. It’s a pattern that I mimicked my entire life and that she learned from her parents. I was a liar and a cheater and my mom would encourage it. I have expressed my feelings to my mom and told her that we needed to draw a line; she can't talk to me about her relationships any longer. 

Well, we sent out wedding invites last week and I told her that she wasn’t allowed to bring her new boyfriend. It’s the guy that she cheated on my stepdad with and I feel like inviting them shows some level of approval and validates her actions, which I have no plans to do. I also think that it would be incredibly rude to allow them there since my stepdad will be in attendance. 

My mom was appalled when I mentioned it to her. My brothers seem equally unhappy. The way I see it, my entire life has always been shared with whoever her fling is. I look back at pictures from birthdays and holidays and  sports games and it’s always a different “family picture.” I don’t want to look back at my own wedding pictures 30 years from now and wonder who this guy was too.

I'm positive that my mom did her best raising me. I know she loves me. I realize a lot of the resentment I have towards my upbringing is due to my dad cutting ties with me. But I really don’t want my mom’s marriage-ruining energies anywhere near my wedding. My fiancé is in strong support of my decision but my immediate family is not. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c22nbo	2019-06-18 14:04:48	MagicMoller	AITA for not sending an old friend money	"Background, this guy and I were friends during junior year of high school. Pretty close at the time, he introduced me to a local volunteer firefighter organization, and we just bonded really well at the time. He and I were also polar opposites in a lot of ways; he was really popular, I was far from it. I hadn't really drank or smoked anything then, and he partied hard (to the point of health problems). He moved at the end of junior year and it's been 2-2 1/2 years since then.

This guy, Joe (fake name), and I didn't keep in touch once he left. I had told him some problems I dealt with while being his friend and told him many stemed from his actions and pressure to do stuff. It was quiet until he and his then wife ended their marriage. It had been about a year that they had been married he told me, and he was in love. He had problems with depression before, and it came back with a vengeance. 

NOTE: I often helped people when it came to mental health. Don't know why, just had a knack for figuring people's problems out.

I helped him through it, he said he was gonna fight for her. Two days later he calls her a skank, a dumb bitch, and moved on. Had another girl in a week. This was common back in high school too. I said you do you, and we didn't talk for a couple months. Then, his new girlfriend decided to end it as well (see the pattern here?) He came to me, said it was even more serious than his ex-wife, he needs her, etc. I'm tired of being his therapist, so I told him to sort it out himself. He gets kinda pissy, and I ignore him.

Two or three days later, he asks if I'll send him 20$ through cashapp. I'm a vocational graduate for welding, and I'm currently working 7 days a week, 10 hours a day. I get good money, but I work really hard for every penny. I'm instantly pissed for him even asking, and tell him no, and he needed to plan his shit out better. He gets upset, and say he's moving (because of the break-up) and he needs it for toiletries. I still say no. I suspect that be the last I hear from him.

My question is, AITA? This guy will take take take and take any sign of kindness people show him until it is dried up. He's never asked about my situation,  how I'm doing, etc. All he does is take. But I guess it's only 20$. Idk."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Hey Reddit,

First post so here we go -

I work for a Digital Agency. It's my first role in the creative industry having worked in pretty corporate businesses since graduation. I've written a lot of blogs/papers in the past but they have all had quite an academic tone to them.

I'll be the first to admit it's a culture shock to shift from corporate to the more friendly, casual tone of voice of a creative agency - but I am trying really hard. I've been asked to write a number of blog posts for the agency as we're focusing on growing out content marketing. This isn't a problem as I love researching and writing content so I put a lot of time and effort into what I am doing, even if the tone isn't exactly the right fit for the brand. I don't like to think I am overly precious about my work, but I am proud of it and put in a lot of effort.

Now, the problem is I'm finding I'll be asked to churn out drafts for blogs and they'll sit there in the review funnel gathering virtual dust. This has been frustrating in the past as some of the blogs have been time-sensitive and have been left so long that they're no longer relevant and just become obsolete. It's a shame, but I get people are busy.

What's really started to get me demoralised though, is recently my drafts are being chopped, changed and then posted under my colleague's name. Fair play, said colleague is the one doing the chopping and changing, but it does feel like I am doing a lot of hard work only for it to be refined and put out as someone else's work. I tried to raise this once before and was told that because that specific piece was time sensitive it was easier for them to rework it to the correct tone and get it out the doors as quickly as possible. It stung, but I understand that it can take a lot of time reviewing content back and forth correcting style and tone.

The trouble is, this keeps happening. I get that the content isn't about my personal reputation, it's about getting content out there for the business - but it's tough seeing my work frankensteined in this way. The biggest kick to the balls though, is that I don't feel like I am improving. I want to be able to just write content and get it out there without having to eat up so much of my colleague's time in edits/review and if I don't know what I am doing wrong then I don't know how to change. As much as I like to think I'm going to work here forever (honestly, besides this it's a dream job) I get that nothing is for certain. It would be good to be able to build a portfolio of work with my name on it just in case the worst happens and I need something to refer to in future.

Am I being oversensitive here? 

Digital Agency workers of Reddit - what's your experience in schooling a new writer on TOV and flow? Is it more trouble than it's worth? Is this normal for the industry? Do I just get over myself and stop stressing and feeling undervalued?

This may be lost and equate to just bitching into the void here, but any advice on what to do would be really, really appreciated."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c22lps	2019-06-18 14:01:06		WIBTA if I asked my friends to stop smoking weed around me?	"So last year I started smoking weed pretty often, every weekend or so while I was at uni. I have 2 other flatmates who are also my best friends and I love and trust them dearly, they are good people. I had to stop smoking weed because one night I smoked WAY too much and had a pretty severe panic attack and several since then and have recently been diagnosed with panic disorder by a psychologist. 

Obviously since then I have stopped smoking for good and haven't touched weed since the incident and don't plan on doing it ever again, however my flatmates do still smoke it regularly in our flat and honestly I just really hate being around it because it just sets off my anxiety since I just associate it with my initial panic attack.

Sometimes they bring some friends round (who are also my friends) and smoke in the flat aswell. Now it gets kind of tricky because I really don't want to be THAT guy who is all anti-drugs and stops people from coming round to smoke but they don't know the extent of my anxiety right now (I've brought it up to them briefly but not had a proper conversation as I feel like I'd look a complete pussy) and so I fear it would look this way.

WIBTA if I ask my friends to not smoke around me due to my anxiety or would that be lame as fuck? I would probably just ask them to smoke outside or when I'm not in the flat but I really don't know how I'd go about bringing it up without seeming like I'm just trying to ruin the fun for everyone else because of my own issues. I need help, big time."	Asshole	0	0

It wasn't a quiet museum (it was pretty loud in there honestly), or a particularly serious museum for that matter (we were in Roswell, so...). There were no signs about being quiet, etc.

10 year old daughter is reading the placards out loud, partly so she can ask us about words she doesn't get, partly because her great grandmother is with us and can't really read the rather small text because her eyesight isn't great these days.

After some time, a guy walks up, glowers at her, and somewhat politely (he wasn't yelling and he said please once) but sternly tells her not to read out loud because it makes it hard for other people to read internally.

Then he turns around and hits a button to start the (rather loud) video on a monitor a couple feet away.

My mother apparently tells the guy she's helping her great grandmother out.  I didn't hear this conversation as I was quietly reassuring my daughter who was upset.

Which isn't a problem by itself. The cat is cool, I mean she keeps it locked in her room all day when shes at work, but whatever. And her dog has free reign like dogs do. 

So anyways, bless her heart, this dog is the stupidest thing in the world. I would take her out in the lawn like every time I could (I work 2 jobs) and my dog is just fine with not shitting and pissing in the house. But no, this dog will run straight to the door and try to pee in the house even if I haven't let her out since I left for a shift.

So starting 2 days into this madness, I left her bedroom door open, put down some puppy pads, and opened her bedroom door so she, the dog, would have access to her food, her mom's bed, the cat could run around all day upstairs to her heart's content, and my own dog would stay out of everyone's food. Hes a bit of a greedy whore but that's what gates are for. 

So, AITA for keeping the kids upstairs and not wanting to clean up shit and piss for a week? I feed them, check their water, give them snuggles, etc. But I'm not in the mood to hunt down piss puddles through the house every 5 or 6 hours for a week."	Asshole	0	0

So they give me the gift later and I open it, and the box has precooked vacuum sealed corn on the cob that they sell specifically at the dollar store

my brother tim took him in when jeffs wife threw him out. this was about 3-4 years ago. i then moved in out of my parents house two years ago because i cannot afford a house of my own yet and he’s charging me dirt cheap rent. if i could purchase a home today i would but i’m still saving. fast forward to today and jeff is a miserable person to be around. it’s a small house. i am 31, tim and jeff will both be 37 this december. jeff does not communicate. things like if he is gone all weekend or when he will be returning. i know that this is not required for someone to do but it is courteous. remember we are all supposed to be friends. we golf together, go out together, things like that. 

jeff will grocery shop and stock the fridge with 3 large cartons of juice at one time and take up the entire fridge space. jeff has not offered to clean the shower or toilet once. jeff will not let us know that him and his gf are planning on cooking a giant feast for themselves when we all need to cook dinner every night. jeff just this morning parked his car behind tim blocking him in when he have space for us to park correctly to avoid this problem. jeff does not ever fold community laundry like towels. all jeff wants to do is argue with my brother tim instead of say ya sorry my bad i’ll try to work on that. all these little things have just been adding up and it’s become quite awful to be around. tim finally told jeff i think it’s time you start looking to move out by the end of summer/fall. their friendship is deteriorating. jeff is just a bullshitting lying adult child. jeff acts like he is the homeowner and we are his tenants. 

i’m not a confrontational person. their arguments absolutely ruin my day and weekends. all jeff does is eat and sleep. he essentially is acting like he lives alone and disregards the two other people in the tiny 2 bedroom 1.5 bathroom house (i live in the basement).

I do feel kinda responsible for this, because I did say she could always talk to me whenever she was upset (said this to her after a particular bad anxiety attack). But I’ve realised it’s extremely emotionally taxing for me and the guilt tripping is just horrible.

I went to a Doctors appointment yesterday and when I arrived there was a women speaking on the phone. Normally, this wouldn’t bother me but after sitting for 25 minutes (yes, my doctor sucks) she was still on the phone. She wasn’t yelling but she definitely was not being considerate of her volume.

I finally asked her *politely* if she wouldn’t mind just taking her call outside. She immediately got defensive and said “and why is that?!”. I felt her getting upset and tried to diffuse it by saying that I was not trying to rude, there was also a sign that said no cell phone use in the waiting room. She gathered her things to go outside and then said she didn’t want to miss her name being called. She then got back on the phone and said “I’m going to have to call you back, some people in the waiting room are getting mad that I’m on the phone” they then proceeded to mock me in their conversation and she got off the phone. 

I know most people are going to say it’s not a big deal in either regard. I totally understand that people are busy and have work to do and take time out of their day to come to the doctors but I guess I just felt that her conversation was not of any importance and for the respect of being in a small space with a large group of people; she could have taken the call outside or after. 

I have pretty bad anxiety so I haven’t stopped thinking about this for over 24 hours. Maybe someone could give me a different perspective or validation that what I said was okay."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c22fdb	2019-06-18 13:44:35	lucy1fur	AITA for 'calling' out a pay officer?	"Pay Officer: B

Friend: S

Background: I have frequent (once a month) problems with my pay at my job of four years – from being paid the wrong hourly rate, to being underpaid by hundreds of dollars a week, to not being paid at all. Most recently, I discovered that B has not paid me superannuation for the entirety of my career and, thus, I am owed a couple of thousand dollars from the business.

B and I are hardly at work at the same time and so communicate via email. Though I believe my emails to her have been polite and professional, B *always* replies bluntly, typed in red font with a bunch of ellipses. For example, a typical email from B will look like this (but in red font):

&#x200B;

…Lucy1fur…

… sorry for my error … I would not have picked up until later on ….so thanks.

………….. B

&#x200B;

After speaking with other employees, I found out that they have not had any issues like this with B and that I am the only one that she emails like this.

Because I am frequently having issues with my pay, I am frequently emailing B to fix such. Cut to a couple days ago – my friend and fellow employee S informed me that B called me “desperate for money” in front of a couple of employees regarding the fact that I am always emailing her about pay. So I snapped.

I sent B a lengthy email detailing my frustrations with the constant pay mishaps. In it I told her that I felt that she was trying to belittle and intimidate me with passive-aggressive, blunt emails typed in red font with countless ellipses, and felt targeted by the fact that she spoke to no other employee that way. Finally, I told B that I was told by an employee that she had called me “desperate” and felt deeply upset by her lack of discretion and her unprofessionalism.

Immediately, I was asked by my boss which employee told me that B called me “desperate”, but I have refused to name names so to keep S anonymous.

S is now upset with me for bringing him into this. This is really where the AITA comes in - I totally understand his annoyance, because there are not a lot of other employees that would have overheard B’s comments and so consequently S is under suspicion from B and my boss.

Now, B wants to meet me in person to discuss these issues. I told her that I am uncomfortable with meeting her as I anticipate that, much like in her emails, she will attempt to belittle and intimidate me (and, in my head I am thinking that as a socially anxious 18-year-old these tactics will definitely work).

So, AITA for thinking that red font, ellipses and blunt communication is passive-aggressive, belittling and intimidating? AITA for refusing to meet B in person out of fear of being belittled and intimidated into folding in on myself? AITA for keeping S anonymous from my boss?

Most importantly, AITA for bringing S into this, because even if I keep him anonymous most everyone will assume that it was him who told me about B’s comment?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

They seem to be addicts and steal from her regularly while she enables their habits. As a person, she is polite, but my dad is very stressed about her kids and constantly brings them up. He tries to ""help"" her by taking away her card when she's with him and in essence controlling her so they can't steal. I don't think it's a healthy relationship, but I was willing to stay out of his business. Then, one day, he visits me and tells me he might be breaking up, that he lost his cool, cussed her out, and he was scared of the way he lost control. When he got back with her, he asked to bring Ruth over to my place like nothing happened. 

I texted him telling him no, I don't feel comfortable around her anymore after what he told me. I can't support the relationship. I won't interfere, but I don't want her over. The next time I saw him in person, he told me he told his gf about my text and she was ""hurt"". Now she definitely doesn't want to see her either. Regardless, every single time I see my dad, he pressures me to see her and hang out with them as a couple. He tells me he accepts my relationship (my girlfriend does not do drugs nor does she enable anyone to do drugs), so I should accept his. I just do not want to be around the drama and I just moved away from my emotionally abusive mother. My state of mind is fucked. I just can't handle the chaos and want my home to feel safe.

c22etm	2019-06-18 13:43:11	SnakeFarm26	AITA for making my friend who is now employed start paying for his own stuff?	"Sorry this is a long one, have to give the back story.

So me and this guy have been friends since as long as I can remember. The whole time we were in high school with stupid jobs, we switched on who pad for Wendy’s that day or who got a pack of smokes for the two of us to split because we weren’t old enough to buy them yet. Everything was pretty equal.

But after we graduated I joined the army and left. Every time I came home on leave he would never have a job, just  few dollars his mom and and gave him I guess. So whenever I was back we would hangout and I’d take him to lunch or take him to go get ice cream or whatever the case was at the time. Basically I paid for everything when we went somewhere together. If he needed cigarettes, I got them, a MTN Dew, yup bought it. At the time it didn’t bother me because I wasn’t home all that often. 

Fast forward three years I get out of the Army and go to college, drop out and hate it. Now as I’m waiting to get hired by another employer (police department), I’m living off what money I saved in the Army. Which isn’t much anymore because I got out last November and all the BAH from my GI Bill (money the VA pays you to live while you go to school) went to rent and food etc. But now my friend has a job, and I’m unemployed, and every time we hang out he doesn’t even motion for his wallet, if the bill comes at the table he gets up and goes to the bathroom so he doesn’t have to pay it or offer. If I make a remark like “are you going to take me out this time?” In a joking voice he gets really offended like I’m asking for a hand out or asking him to pay my car insurance or something. I don’t even know how to describe it. After buying double of everything and stuff like this my bank account is going dry.

I’m not looking for him to start paying for my stuff at all, I can make it until I get hired if I stop buying him stuff. I care about the dude a lot he’s my best friend and I don’t want to ruin our friendship over money, but I can’t keep supporting him WHILE HE HAS A JOB and I don’t. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c22dyx	2019-06-18 13:40:51	dibbun18	AITAH if I elevate fight w sil?	"So here’s the backstory: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bzg71g/aitah_in_laws_staying_about_our_house/

Basically, have an infant and wouldn’t let them stay at our house and drive them everywhere to avoid baby getting sick. SIL looses it.

So we decided to meet for dinner so they could meet kiddo. I picked a small, not crowded restaurant and we went early when they weren’t busy so we could have a small corner to ourselves. I know it’s paranoid but w people being so anti vaccine you never know who does or doesn’t have measles now so I made sure baby was near no one.

Niece is young, seems like a good kid, and does things kids do, and seems genuinely happy to see her cousin. But she did crawl around on the floor a little and try to kiss her and touch her after wo washing her hands  and was coughing. SIL tells me she has a cold, toward the end of dinner. Had her wash her hands before dinner but the kid was coughing all over and not covering her mouth. 

I was very annoyed at the time but didn’t say anything. Let SIL but not my niece hold baby. She wanted very much to hug and hold her and stuff and we had to keep shooing her away as politely as we could.

Three days later, baby is running a fever, throwing up, and has a runny nose. She hasn’t been anywhere else since that dinner, no grocery store, no errands, literally no where but home, so I don’t see where else she could have gotten it. Husband and I aren’t sick.

It would be out of line to call SIL and tell her, basically, I was right, and now my baby is sick...? That would be a TA move... I’m so angry. We would have cancelled or kept a much farther distance had we known she was sick.

OTOH, we’re family (although she’s not my sister) and she’s the only other niece we have. I don’t want to sabotage my husbands relationship w his family, and picking a fight would hurt him the most. (He doesn’t want to say anything to keep the peace because his parents are closer to his sister than they are him.)"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"My gf and I are going to a wedding in another country where we are meeting with her college friends and renting a small boutique hotel for the weekend. The wedding is going to last 3-4 days with a lot of activities that are in public (clubs, parks, restaurants, tours).  
We have a friend called M that found out about the wedding and thought that she could hangout with us there. She mentioned that she would be going to the same city with her family and it would be great if we meet up. We told her it's a private wedding and the couple is very reserved so maybe we wouldn't be available. After hearing the negative vibe, she called my gf's college friend(who she is an acquaintance through my gf) and asked for more details and then booked the flight.  My gf is now upset because M is going and now has to hangout with her instead of her college friends. M is the type of person that makes it all about her, everyone has to do the things she wants to do, and is very controlling. I feel bad for M because I believe she is very lonely and needs friends.  In the end, she is nice just needy and wants everyone to hang out together as merry friends.

c22byb	2019-06-18 13:35:33		AITA was on vacation with boyfriend and out bar crawling when I ended up kissing another guys neck.	"Help me out please. Me and him were on a weekend long vacation and we were really enjoying ourselves and having a lot of fun. Come Saturday night when we were to meet up with people, we were getting a lot of free shots and one thing led to another and I had too much to drink, nor had I barely eaten anything that day because our plan was to catch something to eat along the night, that didn't happen. I frankly don't remember anything of the situation that happened, only what he has told me. What he describes of me does not at all resemble myself and how I usually am. 

He described talking to this middle aged guy who was married and had a wife, and I came up to them asking for him to dance along with me, he refused and I had gone up to him and kissed his neck, in front of my boyfriend, (he described it as it looked like I was trying to make out with his neck). Which to me does not sound like something I would do at all. My boyfriend means the world to me, and I've been with him through every step of the way with the loss of family and grief, and done all I could physically, emotionally and mentally been there for him, I in my right mind would never cheat on him, and I have also never messed with another guy when I've been out drinking with my friends. I know my boundaries and I truly respect my boyfriend and his feelings. And I've taken full responsibility for what happened and I dont have any excuses as to why I did what I did, and I don't blame the alcohol. I would have equally been hurt if the table had turned. 

He had taken me to the side and asked me why I did what I did, and he said that I had denied what happened, and then told me that I said I was going to leave without him. Now I know I would never have done that without a reason, I'd never try to get back home to the hotel all alone while being so drunk in a town I've never been to before. So I feel like there's something he has not told me, for me to react that way. 

Anyways, I just need another person's opinion on this, because it's really eating me inside that I've hurt the person I love the most while not remembering it nor know the reason for it."		1	0

c229q2	2019-06-18 13:29:35	MundaneLibrary2	AITA from moving away from fiance's aunt?	"My fiance (F) and I have been together about 2 years now, we just finished university and I'm pregnant with our first child. F and I met outside of uni but after being together for about a year we realised that not only was she his aunt, she was also one of my lecturers.

In uni she told everyone I'm pregnant and threw us a baby shower after we told her not to do either thing. The baby shower invites also used the name she wanted, that we aren't using.

Outside uni she cancelled our delivery of baby stuff by ringing the store as me because some of the onesies were for girls and the baby is a boy, and shown up to my medical appointments when we told her not to come. She's also messaged people who offered us expensive baby stuff for free saying that if they weren't for a boy then we don't want it.

She also rang the hospital as me and tried to get herself listed as my birthing partner. As my hospital only allows one person in the room, this meant that if she succeeded then F would not be allowed in. A said when we asked her about this that she intended to be a ""constant"" in our son's life which meant being there from the moment he is born. I told her the only other people allowed in the delivery room are F and medical professionals and she called me selfish.

A has also asked us about writing a will that states that if F and I die, she will get custody of our son.

There's been more stuff but there's a character limit to think about.

Whenever we ask her to stop, she says ok and then she does it again. When we tried to talk to her about boundaries she said ""we're family. F is like a son to me"".

It's worth mentioning here that F's parents aren't involved. When he was 14 they left, and A took over. She looked after him from 14-16. When F was 16 they had a fight, and A said ""my house my rules"". F left and moved in with his friend. F and A patched things up a couple of years later when he was 18, but their relationship has been fragile since.

We weren't planning on moving, but then I got home from work yesterday to find A halfway through putting child locks on everything in our flat, at least a year before we'd even need them. When I asked her how she got in she admitted that before I moved in she'd had the spare key and she'd made copies without telling F or me.

F wants to take this job on the other side of the country, and so we're planning to move to the town that job is in without telling A. I work remotely so I can do that from anywhere. As fiance starts work 1/8, we're planning on moving in July. A's involvement in the baby's life would be whatever we put on our SM and that's it.

We told our friends what we were planning, and got a mixed response. About half of our friend group think that this is a good move but the other half think it's a dick move.

c229py	2019-06-18 13:29:34		AITA for wanting to confront my girlfriend for not donating to my fundraising campaign?	"I am really conflicted because I haven’t talked to her about this but it is continuing to bother me and the way I feel about her is deteriorating every day that goes by. 

We’ve been dating for over 6 years and have had a great relationship. Very few fights. She is awesome.

Last week I raised money for a cause that involved a personal sacrifice to gain attention. The campaign was really successful and a lot of friends donated. Even those who don’t have a lot found a couple bucks to chip in. Any amount helped. I was really overwhelmed with the great response.

My girlfriend makes less money than me and while we split rent evenly, I ultimately subsidize her life by paying for all vacations, meals out, most groceries, gifts, and I’ll fill up her gas tank often, etc. Whatever I can do to help. I don’t have a ton of money either but I like to be generous with her.

She has always been pretty fair in the past and I know she doesn’t have a ton of money. But the gesture of donating even just $5 would have meant a lot to me. I feel like she just didn’t care and it’s really bothering me.

c228w3	2019-06-18 13:27:17	NeatDoubt	AITA for confronting the girl teasing me?	"So, there’s this girl. I’ve known her for about a year now, and we became friends because we had science together and took the same bus. 
I would never call her a close friend, she was always just a friend for the bus to talk to. About after a month or two, she started to seem a lot ruder. All she would do is talk about how great she is, and would always put me down and say how much better she was than me. I couldn’t really ignore her, we were at the same bus stop and I didn’t want to be rude and tell her to stop talking to me. A couple months ago, she’d been putting down my best friend and my boyfriend. Things along the lines of “Your boyfriend is a year older than you? You know he’s probably gonna cheat on you in college, right. The girls there are gonna be, no offence, a lot prettier and more mature there.” And “Your best friend is really ugly. I mean, how do you be around her?  You’re getting acne. I think she’s giving you it. That’s gross.” So, I started ignoring her a little. I’d avoid her on the bus, just stop seeming so interested in the conversations.  Because of this, she started spreading rumours about me and giving me dirty looks when she saw me (Eye rolling, scoffing, etc). My boyfriend picked up on this and texted her saying “Could you stop glaring at my girlfriend? I don’t know why you are but it isn’t nice. Just talk to her if you have a problem with her.” She blocked him and me. I asked her through iMessage (She forgot to block my number) asking why she gave me looks and was spreading rumours about me. She didn’t tell me, and instead asked me what problem I had with her. I said how she always put me down  and made me feeling utterly awful, and that she never listened to what I had to say. She blocked me. 
I told my best friend about this, and she told me that I’m harassing her and bullying her. (which, as a side note, is very hypocritical because she recently had been getting people to beat up this guy who didn’t want to be her boyfriends friend) 
Am I really the asshole? I mean, should I have just left it alone?

c2254i	2019-06-18 13:16:59	michelinstarred999	AITA for cutting my friend off my life when he asked if he could date the girl he knows I like?	"Yesterday my friend C talked to me and asked if he could date M, the girl I’ve liked for years. C knows that I like M and I’m just waiting for the right time to ask her out again. 

I asked M out before but she turned me down. I was overweight and had confidence issues then, and that lead to me getting angry at her. We didn’t talk for a time, I missed our friendship and regretted reacting the way I did. C helped me by becoming the bridge between me and M. M and I eventually started talking again. 

Since then I have gone to the gym, lost weight and gained confidence. I also got closer to M, we talk almost every day about almost everything. She gets me special gifts on my birthdays and always encourages me to continue being healthier (I still have a bit to lose to get to my target weight). I wanted to ask her out again, but I was waiting for the right time. I just needed a sign to assure me that she’s ready to be more than friends. 

Since last year I’ve noticed that she and C have been talking a lot. They have inside jokes in our group chat with our other friends, tell each other things that they don’t tell the rest of us, they don’t cancel lunch or dinner plans if I and our other friends can’t make it, they just go by themselves. I figured their newfound closeness is because they bonded over a new game that they both play. M and I still talked every day, and C and I still talked and he never said anything whenever I mentioned wanting to ask M out again. 

So I was shocked and felt very betrayed when C suddenly asked if he could date M. Turns out the week before, they met up for midnight fast food and when he drove her home they looked at each other and ended up kissing. M told him that they shouldn’t have done that but she wasn’t angry, she just said we’re friends, it’s fine, let’s not talk about it again. C has been thinking of her ever since and he thinks he has feelings for her and wants to tell her. I told him that he’s a backstabber and that from now on we are no longer friends. 

I told my friend R what happened and asked how best to let the rest of our friends know. He consoled me but said it was not right to get angry at C because M is not on object that I can ‘reserve’. But that’s not the point. C knew how I felt about M and he still did what he did, behind my back. He broke my trust.

"The long extended title says it all really. A couple days ago my friend and I started taking shots and watching Lord of the Rings. When our mutual friend came home we took our 11th shot and attempted to play a game of Counter-Strike. It ended very poorly and that's when my friend (Carl) got a text from a girl that he works with asking him to help her move some furniture into a new place. Well Carl has been making some very out of character decisions ever since he's opened up about how he feels about this girl. He drove 35 minutes home after downing 5 vodka shots and who knows what else a couple weeks ago. I know for a fact he would have never done anything like that if the girl in question wasn't going to the bar too. Basically his behavior has been much more erratic and thoughtless when it comes to her. It strikes me as him being an emotional horny dumbass especially since he's never had many crushes or has hardly ever been romantically involved with anyone before. It only takes a momentary lapse of judgement to fuck something up horrendously when driving and having that much alcohol in your body. 

I'm kinda rambling at this point since I just woke up and barely got any sleep but I refused to let him try to make a 40 minute drive to this girls house while having 11 shots of whiskey in him. I've known this dude for the basic entirety of my life and I just refuse to let him make a stupid mistake over a girl that's only ever interested in him while she's drunk and has another boyfriend."		1	0
c222gl	2019-06-18 13:10:55	distinct_bumblebee	AITA for taking away my son's electronics for his online activity?	"Let me begin with some background.

I am a white man married to a Japanese woman (who lived in Japan until she was 25). We live in the United States together with our son (15 years old) and our daughter (4 years old).

I like to think that we have worked hard to raise them with positive values, emphasizing self-esteem and respect for others. We took my son to Japan when he was ten years old because he really wanted to go, and we are planning another trip in the near future as well.

As of late, I have felt that my son has had a radical change in personality. He has ignored me frequently and really just wanted to be left alone to his devices. I figured it was just your average run of the mill teenage blunder stuff, but over time, it began to escalate. A few days ago he called me a ""sexpat."" 

I had no idea how he had learned this term. So, during the daytime when he was at school, I went on his computer. 

I found what I had suspected. While I won't go into details or name names, he was a frequent poster on a board for half-white half-Asian people who despise their white lineage. Generally they are a rotten bunch of people, but the brainwashing on the board was astounding to me. I noticed that my son had been participating for about two months--about the time when his behavioral changes began.

What I did next was something I figured was perfectly reasonable for the circumstances: I unplugged his computer, removed the HD, and put it at my folks' house. When he got home, I confiscated his smartphone and told him that I saw what he had done. He went into a standard spiel about violating his privacy, but I said that he crossed lines that justified my actions when he began name calling me. 

I am currently looking into therapists for him because he has been out of control. When I asked people around me what they thought, they seemed to believe it wasn't even that big of a deal. Some of them mentioned that he was just a confused teenager trying to figure his mixed heritage out, and that he would grow out of the phase.

Now I'm confused. I was so confident that what I did was reasonable, but AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

The friend who owns the lake house, “George”, recently broke up with his girlfriend of five years, “Kate”. We all thought they’d be getting engaged soon. This year, George brought his new girlfriend of about six weeks, “Lauren”. Lauren is only about a year out of college, and I got the feeling this was her first “adult” relationship. Although she’s new to the group, we’ve had a ton of fun the past few days. Until yesterday. 

Yesterday we decided to go waterskiing. I’m terrible at waterskiing and have only gotten up successfully on a specific pair of skis Kate always used (we’re both petite, and adult skis were impossible to maneuver). 

As we started to leave the dock I noticed we only had the adult skis. I turned to George and asked him if we could bring “the small skis”. He looked confused and asks me what I mean. I said “you know, the ones that are easier for me?” again, a look of confusion. I really wanted to try skiing this year, so finally I said “the small skis- the ones Kate always used. Did those belong to you?” George said oh, of course, and ran back into the boathouse to grab them. 
For the rest of the day, Lauren seemed off - not all over George like usual, and acting a bit chilly to me. I dismissed it as a hangover, and enjoyed the rest of my day on the lake. 

That night, I heard Lauren and George arguing in their room. She came down to dinner with a tearstained face but acted fine. Later, George pulled me aside and said my mentioning Kate really upset Lauren, and to not do it again. 

I think Lauren’s being immature and a little ridiculous, wanting to pretend that George’s previous relationship didn’t exist. I did my best to ask for the skis without saying Kate’s name. I don’t want my longtime friendship with George to be affected by this, or have Lauren hold a grudge. And we’re here for another four days. Do I have to apologize to her for saying Kate’s name? I’m not going to give her false reassurances about what is quite likely a rebound relationship.

c2223v	2019-06-18 13:10:13	mikuki007	AITA for making GF put stray kitten she can't afford back outside?	"For the past 2 months my GF has been feeding stray kittens outside (5) yet one had taken a liking to her and apparently loved to be pet & picked up. She knew she couldn't afford it so she never brought it in but never quit talking about wanting it. That ended this weekend.

See my GF already has a cat and has financial troubles lately after a hurricane hit her house this past fall and needed to pay nearly 20Kusd out of pocket to repair her house which resulted in some debt. Before that happened she even took some vacations out of the country too.

I almost have my masters in accounting so her finances are concerning to me if we're going to have a future together her financial burdens will be mine. I keep telling her she needs to save into a savings account yet she doesn't listen to me and claims all of her money goes to bills, the house repairs, food, & she 'just doesn't have money sitting around to put into a savings account right now' and acts like I insult her because 'I don't understand her situation'. I have a degree in accounting while she doesn't have any degree. She should manage to be able to put $10 into a savings a week. I did.

She told me yesterday that over the weekend she made an appointment with the vet for yesterday and brought in the kitten since she had crowdfunded a few hundred dollars to cover the vet visit/neutering.

It bothers me that she has these financial troubles yet brought in another cat she can't afford. I told her to put it back outside. Yet she argued with me that I 'ruined her happiness' and that she had help with the crowd funding to pay for the vet and she had started buying bulk kitty litter and kitty food that was 'cheaper' than buying smaller amounts of food so she thinks it wouldn't cost much more to have 2 cats instead of 1.

After arguing over her finance troubles and the cat she put the stray back outside like I had asked but has been pissed at me since she had to give the money back and is asking if she should rehome the cat she's had for years since 'apparently she can't afford cat food or litter'. She's missing my point here and I think it's unfair she took in a kitten while telling me she doesn't have money to put in a savings and that she shouldn't take on more financial burdens. I'm just looking out for her best interest.

Of course every group needs to write down notes and ultimately put together a detailed protocol which is to be handed to the professor afterwards. There is a deadline for the protocol of exactly 2 weeks after the experiment every group has to stick to.

To get this thing done I created a whatsapp group to make a schedule for the group and to split up the work evenly among the four of us group members. Well, as it turns out my fellow group members are a bunch of lazy blockheads and they were'nt even responding to any messages I left in that group.

I started to assemble poorly written protocols to barely meet the expectations of the professor but for one of the last protocols i decided to not to anything that would come up to the expectations at all because I'm sick of doing all the work alone.

"So basically, a guy comes in to yoga class with half a thigh remaining of one of his legs and I was honestly curious how he'd hold the poses throughout the class, and secretly rooting for him in my head. We are the only two dudes in class and he's likely a veteran because we are in a town with a big army base. I, too, am a veteran. During one of our stretches his hand touches my foot and he profusely apologizes. Class ends and I go up to him and ask if he needs any help with his crutches or whatever, and as a gesture to say it's all good don't apologize, and he just responds ""nah I'm good.""

c21vm2	2019-06-18 12:51:58		AITA for condemning this guy?	"Hey all! Just wondering if I am right in not approving of this guys actions, and disliking him because of it.

I should start off by saying that this person is not my friend, more of an acquaintance, and that I will be referring to them as ""Jon"" throughout this post. Jon is my girlfriends friend, but I think even she is starting to have enough of him. I never really liked him, and the stuff he did/does is making me dislike him more.

&#x200B;

Here are some things hes done which really tick me off:

\-He once scammed a dude with autism. The dude offered him 50 euros to get the link to his discord because he wanted people to talk to, and Jon took the money and gave him the link to a wrong discord. He still defends this by saying ""He doesnt need the money."" This is probably the worst thing hes done, and it still really pisses me off.

\-Him and a friend of his once visited my girlfriend and stayed there for a couple of days. It was actually suppossed to be for a week, but she couldnt bear them anymore. Jon and his friend got high (not sure if my gf was high too) and Jon started to touch her on the shoulder, and didnt stop even though my gf told him multiple times to. He also tried to force her hand on his beard, which is pretty weird. I do not think being high is a good excuse for this kind of behaviour.

She talked to them to get them to leave earlier, and they refused to leave, saying that ""If we came all the way here, we might as well stay the whole week."" She did get them to leave earlier, albeit not as soon as she would have liked.

They then missed their train and had to borrow money from my gf's mom (around 100 euros iirc) and never even tried to pay it back.

\-Him and the same friend from up above are now going to travel to Japan, and Jon is getting 1000 euros from his dad to pay for the trip. This isnt a bad thing really, I just dont like how he argues about this: ""My dad never payed attention to me, so he can give me 1000 euros."" He is also not working, and afaik not making any effort to try and maybe go to school or find a job. Although thats not really a bad thing, in my opinion.

&#x200B;

Otherwise, hes not really doing much. I do not like his personality that much, which is why I try to stay away from him, but the stuff hes done just make me really dislike him. My girlfriend is friends with him, so maybe hes not as bad as I think he is. They were best friends at some point, but I doubt they are anymore. And its not like he does bad things every day, as these were pretty spread out.

I am sorry if this post looks like I am looking for validation. If you people believe I am, I will gladly delete this post. Also, sorry if this is kind of the wrong sub, Im new to posting.

c21vlh	2019-06-18 12:51:56		AITA for telling my girlfriend we shouldn't be going out with the opposite sex with not in a group	"So I've always felt that when your in relationship you should refrain from having nights out with the opposite sex when its just the two of you. Now if say the woman I'm dating is going to a group night out and men are in the mix, that's cool no problem have fun. 

I also expect the same from my partner, as in if you wanna go have drinks cool go alone or go with a female friend, if you go with a group and there are guys mixed in that's fine as well. But just one on one in a bar or a restaurant having drinks and dinner? That's date and crossing a line in my book.

The only times I would be OK with a woman I'm dating going out with another man is if they are family or I know the person myself, very well. 

And there are multiple reasons for this

* I don't trust men I don't know. Men have done and horrifying things
* I feel men are naturally more horny then women, and will make moves on a woman. 
* People also make stupid decisions when drinking, don't put yourself in that situation to begin with

I also apply this rule to myself. I will not go out with a woman that isn't my girlfriend unless they are family or someone my girlfriend knows and approves of. Or if my girlfriend would be meeting up with me later. 

An example of this

We were going have a couples date, all four us were traveling in from different cities and by the luck of the draw her friend (female) and I would be arriving about 2 1/2 hours early. My girlfriend have known this girl for YEARS and I asked my girlfriend ""Should we wait at the train station or what?"" and my girlfriend said ""No, head to the bar we are meeting up and have a couple drinks I'll join you later""

Cool

Her boyfriend ended up joining us before my girlfriend arrived, but that was fine."		1	0

So I live in a college town, but have an internship over the summer. I have just moved apartments and I had been sleeping on the ground for a couple of weekdays. I had already arranged for my friend to help me out with bringing a mattress from home since he was planning to drive to town during the weekend. Long story short, he called me saying he forgot and didn’t know what to do. I got a bit upset seeing as I would be sleeping on the ground for at least another full week without this bed because I don’t have a method to transport it.

I offered to pay for his gas and dinner and ride with him in order to have him bring it up anyway. I asked if we could do this on Saturday and he said no, he didn’t want to drive (all his driving Sat.  would’ve been about 5 hours with 3 of those being for me, including him getting home after dropping of the bed). He said he could Sunday instead but I was occupied with tutoring to make ends meet. That left us at a standstill where I’m upset that he forgot and wasn’t able to make it up by doing it on Saturday even though he could have, and he’s upset because he thinks it’s my fault for not reminding him to get the bed and being busy the day he wanted to do it.

I’ve driven hours for him and, while I do forget things sometimes, I ALWAYS go out of my way to do whatever I can, however inconvenient, to make up for it. This is why I’m upset that he isn’t willing to drive a few extra hours for me after he forgot. But I also realize he’s doing me a favor with all this and doesn’t necessarily have to. Now we aren’t talking and I’m thinking about uninviting him from a vacation we had planned later. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c21t52	2019-06-18 12:45:05		AITA for ghosting on a job?	"This happened a month ago, but I kind of feel bad about it looking back. I started a new job at a popular retail store (not going to disclose the name for privacy reasons), and they hired me as an associate. They didn’t tell me anything about what the job would entail, and hired me immediately. 

I’ve had multiple other retail jobs and none have been as bad as this one. I need to make money, but they would send me home after one hour during a day shift. They would only give me jobs like sweeping and stocking stuff. 

The job is mostly for call ins, when they need you and they would only ask me to work from 9am-12am and it would sometimes go on way longer. 

For an entire week, my only shifts started after the store closed and I wasn’t asked to work during any day shifts. They would call me often and ask me to do nights all the time, and I was only there for a short time but they really were taking advantage of me being new. 

One night shift, the manager was telling me to reorganize the entire store and that she “doesn’t do that stuff” and didn’t even help. When I was asked to sweep she’d say “uh, did you do this other thing yet,” and when I was doing that other said thing she would ask me if I sweeped everywhere. The entire time, she was doing absolutely nothing. 

Usually retail jobs give you day shifts and some night shifts, and everyone does their part in night shifts but they literally wanted me to do all the night shifts with no help as a new associate. I felt completely duped and just stopped coming in. I didn’t feel like they deserved a response, since I only had a few night shifts during the week I quit anyway. 

At the time, I was going through some stuff as well so I really didn’t feel like explaining, I was just pissed off. AITA?"		1	0
c21rfo	2019-06-18 12:40:12	SteamedSpaghetti	WIBTA if I tried to get rid of a co-tenants friend who is living in our rented house.	"I rent a house with 2 other ""friends"", and one of my friends (A) had been mentioning about a friend (someone I don't know) staying over the summer, no details, just briefly mentioned in passing. 

I left to go home when my University term had finished and I message A to ask what is happening with his friend. He says that he'll be coming in two weeks and asks if it's okay if he stays in my room. I was chill with this, but waited for when I cleared my room to reply.  

I come back to collect my things a few days later and see my room trashed (dirty clothes everywhere, condoms littered the bed, my possessions thrown to one side). The friend had moved in the day I left and made himself at home; without A mentioning it whatsoever, aside from the text saying he's coming in two weeks (A and his friend are currently away and back in a few days). I had to quickly tidy everything and move everything out just to be able to see my things to be able to clean and bring them back. He apologises only for the mess and not for the person moving in without my knowledge or permission. 

Plans change and I tell him I have to stay in the house next week and ask for no one to stay in my room. This message was ignored.

When I come back the next week, the person has resumed living in my room, albeit the mess was less, I message A again saying he could of at least waited a week before allowing his friend to move there again. I move and fold all the friends possessions in the room to A's room. 

I'm very quiet and shy, so it took me a lot to confront him about it in the morning. I talked to him in the morning about it, saying he could have told me what was happening and how he didn't respect my wishes. He said he didn't care and he did nothing wrong and he didn't reply to my messages because they were 'gay ass messages' and that there was nothing I can do about it. 
I am now stuck as I know his friend has moved back into my room without my permission, which I am paying rent and bills for.

I am a bit upset that my 'friend' thinks he can just ignore me and do what he wants. I hate trying to fight something and normally will just give up and let it happens, but I felt I should stand up for myself this time. I am the lead tenant as well so hold most responsibility for any damages caused or other problems with the house. The friend being there is breaching our tenancy contract and A had a key cut for him.

WIBTA if I contacted my estate agent explained how A is sub-letting against the permission of the other tenants?
I also have control of the WiFi, Gas, Electricity and Water, so WIBTA for cancelling them giving him enough notice to restart?

c21r5q	2019-06-18 12:39:23	YHXY	AITA for Letting the Fishes Die?	"Ever since I was very young, I had a deep set fear for fish. The way they look, the way they smell, the way they move, everything about them make my skin crawl, and dead fish give me sleepless nights. I know some people can find them appetizing or cute, but I can never find myself among them. No, I really hate fish, and I would do anything to avoid them.

My family has a big tank in the house and they had some red and yellow pet fish in there(no idea what kind, never asked, not interested), we had them for a little over a year. An agreement was made before my family had them was that I would have absolutely nothing to do with the fishes. I would not feed them, change their water or even as much as look at them. Nothing personal or what, I could do anything else from cleaning the house to laundry but I would not do anything that has to do with the fishes.

There was a day when I was home alone on a weekend that I noticed something was wrong in the tank. The fishes were all gathered at the top of the water level and there were 2 or 3 flat at the bottom. I assumed those at the bottom were dead, but did not look closer.

I called my parents and told them about it, they asked me to remove the dead fishes immediately and change the water, in which I refused. While it was clear that the fishes were suffering, I just could not bring myself to look at dead fishes, much less scooping them up or touching their water, the mere idea made my hair stand. My Dad yelled at me through the phone, asking me to cut the crap and save the remaining fishes. I hang up and went back into my room.

All the fishes were dead by the time my parents returned. I did not see their actual bodies, but I could imagine and felt sorry. According to Dad the water temperature somehow rose way beyond safety level and the fishes were either suffocated or cooked alive. As expected, I had a whole earful from my Dad, he really loved those fishes. My brother was angry at me too, because he had a favorite among them.

Even till now, months later my Dad would bring this incident up from time to time and call me a heartless a** for letting the fishes die. While I do feel sorry for the poor fishes, I simply could not have saved them. I already made it clear to my family on the day we got the fishes that I would have nothing to do with them, and now they put all the blame on me."	Asshole	0	0

This has gotten worse over the years since I was severely bullied and I couldn't take it. I was bullied for things that were out of my control too like my alcoholic brother. This led to me having anxiety and depression. I don't have many friends, maybe like 3, and out of them I only really feel comfortable with 1. My anxiety gotten to the point that I rather spend my time browsing reddit in recess than talk to my fellow classmates. (Which I've been made fun of for, obviously)

My mom always asks why I don't have friends and why am I not out going like my parents. The answer always just ""Mom I don't want to talk to people"" and she gives me a huff and leaves me alone. Because of not wanting to talk to people because of anxiety but still wanting contact because I'm human I've fallen into depression and spend hours a day wandering in my house thinking about life and how could I fuck it up this bad. (Thankfully my depression is getting a bit better since I got a puppy I can take in my lap and pet, it helps me calm down)

My mom wanted me to work this summer since I can finally do volunteer work and earn some cash I can spend on things with it. I don't mind working since I could use some money but my mom thought that this would mean that I would make friends. It didn't... I'm going to work in a Museum for the summer as a ticket man (or something alike) and I will be working with my best friend so it will not be terrible. Well my mom and I went to the Doctor last Wednesday and she told us that I need to get in contact with people or I might turn out to be schizophrenic (she might have a point considering my overthinking and wandering) and because of this my mom contemplated on whether or not I should work in a museum where I won't meet new people.

Well the thing is is that my mom said that she doesn't want me to work in the museum and instead wants me to work in our orchard where I could be out in nature and I could meet people by working there. The problem is I don't really want to meet those people that work there. Also it's not like I could even strike up a conversation. Me trying to talk to people goes something like this: 

Me: *tries to talk to ask them something mumbling and whispering in Mickey Mouse's voice*

Them: *doesn't notice me*

Dad (when he's next to me): Son, what is this Mickey Mouse shit? HEY YOU, MY SON'S TALKING TO YOU!

Them: Oh, hi Matt!

So I told her ""mom I'm not going to befriend anyone there anyways, you know that. Please let me work somewhere I can actually earn some money"" she huffed and said okay but she's dissapointed. My dad agreed that I should've worked in the orchard.

But there was just this one thing that bugged the hell out of me. She always used to dismiss my interests and go as far as to borderline bully me for them.

This would be fine if I was able to do it back to her. She has pretty eccentric interests, but no. If I ever try to banter with her about it, it immediately turns into a real fight. Don't get me wrong, we got along the rest of the time. It's just that one little thing.

So I tried to bring it up. Bad mistake. I open a message with something like ""hey (name) this has been bugging me for a while but it feels really shitty when you make fun of my interests"" 

(When i get nervous I type like really formally)

She instantly starts going on about how she was a bad friend and it's was fine if I didn't wanna be friends with her anymore. There is no mention of trying to change. At one point she brings up the fact that she's had a really rough week so she couldn't deal with this right now (keep in mind i was with her all week, so either it was her mind being a shit or sympathy points.) And how, since she has mental issues, it's really tough to take this on board. I asked her to change one thing.

I apologized even tho im pretty sure I'm not in the wrong. We were fine for about two weeks, sending memes and shit. One day, she ghosts me and tells a mutal friend to not believe what i say and that we're on 'bad terms'. She hasn't talked to me since.

Anyway, my mom and dad met when my sister was 7. My dad has been her primary father figure ever since, as her dad dropped in and out of her life. 

My parents are together but have never married, and their finances are separate. Neither of them currently have a will.

My mom has a couple rental properties, and my dad owns a large property. 

During our discussion, my sister mentioned that her half of my father’s estate will be bigger than what she received from her own father. 

And that’s where we have a difference of opinion. 

My sister did not offer to give me half of her recent inheritance. Which is fair enough, and I did not expect her to. I fully expect to share our inheritance from our mom 50/50, but in my opinion my father’s estate is mine. She begs to differ. 

AITA for thinking this way?

EDIT;

There was no argument, it was a comment that my sister made that got me thinking. I was asking if, god forbid, the worst should happen without my dad having made a will, WIBTA if I didn’t split the estate with my sister, as I am the sole legal beneficiary. But morally, I don’t think it is that clear. 

If my dad makes a will and leaves everything to the dog shelter, that’s fine, his money, his choice. But that’s not the situation as it stands."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c21j37	2019-06-18 12:16:42	MarieSurvives	WIBTA for giving a baby up for adoption/having an abortion without the father knowing?	"Hi everyone, sorry for this. 

I’m currently pregnant after a very dumb ONS. We did use protection, but I still ended up pregnant. 

Please don’t hate me for this, but I’m really not ready to be a mother. I’m begin 20s, still in college and have a part-time job which is definitely not enough to support a family. Part from that there’s also personal reasons. Because of this I decided to give this baby up for adoption or having an abortion is the better option. I would prefer abortion... 

Here’s the problem. I haven’t told the father, someone I know from HS, that I’m pregnant even. And if he finds out, I want to tell him it’s not his. (We did use protection and he doesn’t know he’s the only one I had sex with recently.) 

I feel awful about it, but if he found out about it I know he’d try to convince me to keep it, as it’s one of his firm beliefs that a child should stay with its parents and especially mother. He has a very strong personality and opinions on things, while I really am not the most assertive person so have trouble standing my ground against him.

I also really don’t want to create a situation where he raises the baby alone, as he’s at the moment also not fit to do so I think. He doesn’t work, has a lot of issues he has to work on, etc. 

WIBTA for having an abortion/giving a baby for adoption without the father knowing?


Edit: I realise now I shouldn’t have put adoption and abortion in the same question as they are so different. Sorry everyone. Personally I would prefer abortion. The reason I’m doubting is because the father is very much against it (murder, etc.) And I feel guilty, even if he doesn’t know. Don’t really know how to explain it. But ofcourse adoption without him knowing doesn’t make it better, I realise now. On the contrary even.

Edit #2: This blew up in a way I didn’t expect, sorry guys. And thank you for taking the time to reply. Few things I would like to say if that’s okay. Please don’t send me private messages about not having an abortion... My question really was about whether or not to tell him, not whether to choose abortion or adoption. I’m sorry. I know you mean well. Also some people asked why I’m so sure he’d be unfit as a father. Ofcourse I can’t be sure I guess... Just I know of issues he’s dealing with right now (which I will not share as I feel it’s not my place). But I realise I don’t know how he would change IF I choose to carry the baby to term. Abortion will still be my first choice though.. Thank you all.

The only “job” he has he got from zip recruiter, which literally just requires him to take a package or two to the post office and ship it to where ever. I see way to much potential with him
To just watch him do absolutely nothing, and i don’t want I keep bugging him to try and get a job, but he seems perfectly content with his new... “job” and doesn’t want to make the extra effort while he does that. So AITA for trying to push him so he will be successful?"		1	0

c21fjf	2019-06-18 12:06:14		AITA for bringing up my father's obesity when he tried lecturing me on smoking?	"I'm 24/m and I smoke weed a couple of times a week. I don't smoke cigarettes unless I'm drinking on a night out with friends. Anyway my father (55) knows I smoke weed occasionally, and I believe he suspects I smoke cigs habitually too. In light of this, any time I have the slightest cough/cold he likes to make these thinly veiled remarks about my ""cough"" i.e. throwing shade about my smoking habit. 
My father is also at least 65lbs overweight (falls into ""obese"" category) and has been for years. He makes occasional attempts to reverse this but these amount to going on a couple more runs/walks per week, while he refuses to change his diet or take any well intentioned constructive critiscim. These attempts fail every time and he has continued to gain weight, even despite being effectively unemployed for the last 3 years with ample amounts of time on his hands, he has not lost a pound despite consistently claiming to be trying to lose weight. I was totally supportive at first but now I find this exhausting.


So last week I'd been out camping for a few days - it was very wet the whole time and I picked up a cold with a bit of a cough. 
Yesterday I over at my friend's place for their birthday party so I ended up smoking some weed (I know it's not advisable when you're sick, it was only because of the occasion). 

As a result of this, this morning my cough was slightly worse - after hearing me, my father walked into the kitchen and declared ""I really don't like the sound of that cough Shards"" in a voice laced with subtext. 
I'd had enough and immediately responded ""And I don't like the sound of your breathing - huffing and puffing at the slightest exertion. I appreciate the concern but honestly I'm not in the habit of taking health tips from someone who's been actively obese for the last decade and changed nothing about it."" and walked upstairs to my room without another word. 
I'm still up here and feel terrible about throwing that in his face (although I also feel it's a harsh truth he needed to hear from somebody eventually)...AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

Recently my sister got sick and couldn't go to work and won't be able to until around july. They were barely scraping by because she wasn't making money and they had little to no money for food and other expenses. I had a little over 700$ saved up and decided that I would give her 200$ of that money. She's also very nice to me and has given things to me as well even when she didn't have to. So apparently my mom somehow figured out that I have her it and she freaked out and started yelling. Apparently my older brother 21m gave her 1k a few weeks ago because she's been having issues with her employer and they haven't given her a full time job yet even though she is fully qualified and has worked for a long time there. My sister told me that she would pay me back when she was more financially stable and I said it was fine.  She was shocked that I would give her it because I am her little brother. So reddit AITA?

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 1/2 years and lived together for the last 2 of those. Personality wise, we are very different but extremely compatible and we get along so well, I really love him deeply. As soon as we moved in together he was super messy, like he would spill food and drink and just leave it on the counter or floor. I would say I'm quite laid back and I dont expect the place to be spotless 24/7 but when it come to things that are totally unhygienic and potentially risk our health, I draw the line. We have been on a constant cycle where I say hey look you've left that mess there and he will huff and take at least a week to clean it. I know it doesnt seem like a big deal but it had gotten to the point where I was setting my alarm early in the morning because I know that before he left for work he would have left a mess. This year it has really taken its toll as I've been studying for my masters which has been so stressful on it's own. So this past year I have been responsible for all the cleaning and cooking whilst he would pay for our evening meals (we split our bills and rent). At first this seemed to me like a good compromise until he started buying extremely cheap bland meals to save money to go out with his friends.

This has been going on for the past year and yesterday I just cracked! I went away with my friends and came back to our house in a mess. I actually cleaned the whole house on my actual birthday before I left, so that whilst I was away he had a nice tidy space to chill in as I knew he wasnt going anywhere. I'm trying to talk to him and he just sits there with a blank face saying nothing. I'm usually quite understanding of other people as it's a part of what I do, but today I lost it. I'm so embarrassed by it but his silence just made me so mad. I told him we are going to split absolutely all chores and food costs and live as roomates until he can start to respect the house and myself. I was pouring my heart out to him saying how it's really made me feel and all he had to say was ""is all this really necessary."" I know I was emotional and irked because he was ignoring me but I also feel my emotions are being belittled. He has acknowledged his behaviours in the past but nothing changes and when I've offered to help in the past he says it's up to him.


Am I being irrational or is it the other way round? Because if it is me I would like to learn from this and correct myself and sincerely apologise to him for flipping out. On the other hand if people agree with me I think it's time I get out."		1	0

A little background of me while this incident happened. I just graduate from high school and continuing my study at the same school but it was like pre-university since I still didn't know where should I go. I have a friend who is Max (not an actual name) that doing well on his exam. All my close friend can tell he is showing off his intelligence, for instance, answering all question from the teacher and bluffing on how easy was the exam after it ended. Max was confident in this one particular subject which is General Knowledge that contain all my country government structure, democracy,  constitution and so on. 

&#x200B;

One day, while in the General Knowledge class, i was sitting next to him and taking notes on the law court terms. The conversation followed by;

&#x200B;

teacher : who knows what Injunction means?

Max : THe command from the  court on stopping any action at any specific duration of time bla bla

class : \*clapping for him\*

&#x200B;

and this continue on and on. I realise he is using my note to answer the question when he forgot the meaning.

&#x200B;

I felt annoyed sitting beside him and him getting the credits (i rarely care). After this one question he answers from the teacher, I , without conscious, loudly says to the class ""OHHH WHY ARE YOU READING AT THIS BOOK (my note book) "" while pointing at him, Suddenly all my classmate are focusing at me and laughing at my joke (?) and said nice roast.

&#x200B;

At this point I saw Max was RED. I immediately felt guilty as i never done stupid things. Im giggling around at the situation. Max immediately stop talking when I try to talk with him at that moment. 

&#x200B;

In the end, Max and I finally make up and act like nothing happened."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Would really appreciate judgement on this situation, you may recognise this. If this gets taken down again, I won't bother posting about it again. Don't really want to get banned from this sub so I hope this abides by the rules?)

In early March/April, I (f16) begun applying to jobs in an attempt to get some money to spend on myself. I applied to a lot, including somewhere I really wanted to work. I ended up getting somewhat lucky and got an interview at McDonalds, to which I received a job offer almost immediately. This wasn't the place I had my heart set on but I figured it was a start. I was offered 5 hours per week, which I was alright with.

However, I didn't get much communication on anything regarding the induction. It took two weeks to book it, it happened and then I didn't hear anything until the start of June regarding shifts or anything.

It just so happened that the place I had my heart set on got back to me and offered me a few interviews! I asked what to do to different people in my life and most of them suggested I continue with the interview process, which I did.

When I got the news that the place I had my heart set on had offered me a job, I quickly snapped the offer up. I have my reasons regarding hours, pay and overall transport to there. I explained this in simpler terms to the manager at McDonalds and they looked a bit disappointed and sad.

I feel really bad about it now and am starting to question whether it was an asshole move, due to mixed feedback from people in my life.

At first this was amazing! We could see eachother all the time, we never had to worry about crappy internet connections, life was great. But then it wasn't

I went to Rome by myself for several days. Meanwhile he had some friends staying round his house. Despite asking me for my flight details, he didn't come to meet me at the airport, he didn't ask my dad if he could catch a ride with him, he didn't even text me asking if I landed until an hour after! Where was he instead, eating dinner with his American friends. He put them over me

The next day, he tried to manipulate me into getting ice cream with him, he didn't want to get it with me, he wanted to get it with his friend since ""it's his last night, I want to treat you both"" I politely said no and asked if we could go for a walk instead. What did he say? Can we do it tomorrow evening instead, since tonight is BLANK last night here? Again, I'm placed as number two. Thanks. I didnt go for ice cream or the walk

This past month we went to London. I couldn't even go 24 hrs without crying because I used to wake up everyday to his kisses but got nothing like that this time. I told him that I was looking up flights to go home early HE got upset

While all this is going on, he is complimenting me less, he enjoys himself more with his friends than with me and while I'm with him 5 days a week, I feel alone and empty

Well, I decided to stick around for the whole trip, it was a 2in1 trip with the other half by the French Alps, it was nice, but I was annoyed that he didn't tell me it would be cold and snowy when we visited the mountains

The way home, we had a 10hr stop in Rome airport. He got us dinner twice and then I wanted us to snuggle together while we waiting. No. Instead he had an energy drink so he spent the entire night on his phone playing stupid games while ""keeping watch over me and the bags while I could sleep"". Sure Of course you were. Whatever. In the morning I told him that I would prefer to go on holiday alone

One day after thanking him for putting me as his 2nd priority AGAIN I didn't hear from him again that day. This told me that he wasn't interested in me anymore. That night around 11 or 12, I tried to call him but after he didn't pick up 7 times I entered his house, woke him and exploded!

I told him that I've had enough, the ball is in his court, if he wants me back then he will have to act

Since this, I heard through others that he has been having night terrors and is struggling to sleep. Apparently every time he hears a door open at night, it wakes him incase it's me again, which it won't be because he straight away told me to return his spare key that I used.

But on this particular game day I was going through a breakup and feeling pretty low.  I just wanted to feel good. So instead of a team shirt, I wore an outfit I felt nice in.

&#x200B;

As soon as I walked in her door, she lost it. She yelled that I couldn't wear what I had on and demanded that I change into one of her shirts.  I refused, because not only did I feel more comfortable in what I was wearing, my mother is a heavy smoker and all of her clothes smell of smoke.  I explained why I was wearing the outfit I chose, but she insisted that if I didn't change, she wouldn't go to the game. Since I didn't care about going anyway, I called her bluff and left.

&#x200B;

I got on well with my Father but just clashed with my Step Mother, at the first opportunity I left and moved to the city.

&#x200B;

20 Years past, I did well for myself, I would speak with my Father a couple of times a year everything was fine. We would go down to see them, but rarely would they make the effort with us.

&#x200B;

Now I have a six year old boy and everything is awesome, as soon as he was born everyone made the effort and came to see us. And I started to rebuild the relationship with my Father.

&#x200B;

The problem is they want me and my family to go to see them, I really don't want this for two reasons

1) I just don't want to take my Son to the palace where I was the most unhappiest.

2) I don't want to take my Son to see a bunch of step-relatives who have never made the effort in 20 years and will drop him as soon as he stops being cute.

&#x200B;

I am completely happy to meet in any other location, they can come to us, we have met in multiple locations in the middle. But I don't want to take my son back to my old home.

&#x200B;

I want my Son to have a relationship with his Grandfather, but we all have to meet in the middle, I think that's fair, it's been six years, they should have gotten the hint by now.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately what has started to happen is they have started to mention it every time we meet, it's constant nagging. it reminds me of my childhood and hate it.

c219rs	2019-06-18 11:48:43	Fukthatdeadguy	AITA for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?	"Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200B;

The reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200B;

She immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.

&#x200B;

Well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200B;

My wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200B;

I asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200B;

I can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

&#x200B;

After some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her."" as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.

EDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im.

A lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  We're going to counseling starting tomorrow"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So I [23,M] came in touch with a girl [21] via an dating app. We talked for a long time and in the end she gave me her number and we met pretty fast afterwards. I do really like her and I think it could work with us. The thing is, she is not sure about the whole situation. We talked open about it, she said she wants to take her time and that she does not feel anything intimate yet. She also said that she hopes to fall in love with me but she does not find it fair that she is letting me wait. I told her it's ok, i dont want to force anything upon anyone. Its been two months now, we've met several times, there are a few things that make this whole thing between us difficult: she lives an hour away from me, which prevents us to meet spontaneous. Both of us live with our parents and work, so we do not have time under the week. She is also not a phone person, she barely writes with anyone and is often not answering for a long time. Thats all cool for me, but it makes it hard to really get to know each other. In all our meetings we've been quite intimate, we cuddle and she fell asleep on me and so on (no sex). But a few days later she tells me she needs to break contact for a few days to get a clear head because she is always thinking about our situation and that she is still not sure about all that. In the meantime ive get to know another girl from work, she is pretty cool and I feel like she wants to get into bed with me.

This morning when I was getting ready for work, I was scrolling through Twitter on my phone when I saw my fiance re-posted something from a sex worker about how ""people who hate my veiny boobs and big nipples because they're ugly, well they make me xxxx amount of money and feed my babies, jokes on you!"" I texted him and asked him if he can not re-post this type of content because I think it's weird for a guy to re-post that, and he has a tendency to be fake ""woke"" especially about women's issues and I think this was an attempt for him to be ""woke"" about expectations for women's bodies. I am also not thrilled that he follows many sex worker's on the instagram or twitter, so I guess this ask of him not to re-post it is twofold. I have asked him in the past to not follow so many sex workers because it makes me uncomfortable, especially because he used to message them, so I guess him re-posting this is piggybacking off my uncomfortable-ness with him following so many sex workers.

The day before the examen, after she gets out of bed at 15 (3pm) she asks me if i could send my answers and notes. I tell her no and understandably she gets upset. I tell her that i will help her, but i'm not going the send my work i have worked so hard for the last couple of days. At this point she hasn't even fully looked at the questions.

In the evening she starts going through her notes. She asks me if i could please send my answers to her. I tell her that she need to take the consequences of her actions and that i of course well help her, but if she have started earlier we could easy have helped each other. I'm well aware that the task is close to impasoble at this point. She starts crying a bit and i feel like a huge asshole, but i still go through with it. My girlfriend only just passed the test.

TL;DR Not giving my exam notes to unprepared girlfriend. Girlfriend starts crying. I stick to my guns.

c215n5	2019-06-18 11:34:58	lulululy	AITA for arguring with the check out guy at Batteries and Bulbs after he changed out the battery in my key fob ?	"I walked into a Batteries and Bulbs yesterday and when an employee approached me asking me what I was looking for, I showed him my car keys and said I was looking for a replacement battery. He proceeded to take the keys from me, walked into the the back of the store, came out with the fob opened up and a new  battery in his hand. He then replaces the battery, tests the key to be functional and knods at me to proceed to the check out counter. 
He rings me up and says I need to pay $17. My reaction immediately was,:"" how much does one of those tiny batteries cost?! "" He responded:"" Only 6 bucks if you buy the battery but $17 if you have us change it out for you. 
This did not sound right to me as I was never given the option to buy or have him change it for me, so I started asking him why he assumed I wanted it changed out ? His answer was because I handed him the key. The argument went on for a little while until he finally said: ""screw it, just leave, don't have to pay anything!"" So I demanded he ring me up for the price of the battery which he did with a really bad attitude as his manager was now standing next to him and paid the $6 and left. 
I guess that's how this store stays in business."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c212wx	2019-06-18 11:26:15	SillyPotato27	AITA for not wanting to travel 8.6km to play basketball with my friends?	"There are three localities I'll be referring to during this post. **A** is my neighborhood. no one else lives here (no one from this story). **C** is the place we play at right now. three three live there. it is 8.6km away from **A**. **B** is in between the two places. it's the school where all of us used to study. (we graduated this year). it's 3.2km from my house. two friends live here. another three friends live in between **B** and **C**.

right now, the travel arrangements are really complicated for me. I have to wake up by 5:30AM so I can get there by 7:00AM to play. I have to get on 2 different buses, both of which are uncommon at that time in the morning. In addition, there's about 1.5km of walking to do each way. at times, I have to stop by at place **B** to pick up a friend or two and carpool with them (their parents don't want them traveling alone that early in the morning) which adds even more time and cost to my commute. It becomes extra tiresome, coming back home tired after a couple hours of playing.

I simply can't do this anymore, and proposed an alternate place to play: place **B**, in our school. it's much less traveling for me, less traveling for those who live at **B**. buses from **C** to **B** are quite common, so it's not too difficult for those living at **C**. 

In addition to this, the court at **C** is a public court. we only get to play on one half, so we don't disturb others who play at that time. whereas the court at **B** is unused at that time, so we can play on the whole court without issues.

those who live at **B** are indifferent, they really don't care where we play and don't want to take sides.

those who live at **C** insist that we continue to play there.

we've had a small fight over this, and ended up on an imperfect compromise: they'll alternate the place they play at. one day at **B**, and the next day at place **C**.

I want to push this further, and have them play only at **B**. alternating will only add complexity and make organization difficult. besides, if they can come to **B** without issues, then why not do it every day? (I haven't spoken to them about this part yet)

&#x200B;

Today I was visiting my sister Samantha, Matt's mother. While eating lunch with Samantha and Matt, Matt asked me for advice about life in general, being more confident, getting girls, etc, saying that his mom didn't give good advice. This caused her to frown, but she kept quiet. I listed a few things he should do and then came to lifting weights. I told him exercise in general is good: it obviously helps the body, it relieves stress, and it makes you feel good. For teen guys especially, I'd recommend weight lifting, since it generally society considers muscular/built guys more attractive. Weight lifting, if he sticks to it alongside a good diet, will give him a good body. This will make him look good both in and out of clothes, increase attention from girls, and increase his confidence. 

&#x200B;

This caused Samantha to get really angry, and she angrily said there's nothing wrong with Matt's body and that it's just fine. I replied there's nothing *inherently wrong* with being skinny, but there's also nothing wrong wanting to improve your body so you're healthier, feel better, and look great.

I was getting sick of it, plus I was feeling depressed (mental health stuff) and I decided I wanted to go home. I was just worn out and didn't feel like staying in a social situation. I told Jon I was leaving and he replied with ""fine, fuck off then"". So I did fuck off. A few days later I was hanging out with Jon and he bought up that I left the other night. I told him that I just wasn't feeling up to it that evening and he turned it around and told me it was because I secretly didn't like anyone who was there. Obviously I told him this is completely false, but he was rigid in his belief I secretly hated everyone. Now I feel bad for abandoning my friends and just going home to play Minecraft.

c20pyp	2019-06-18 10:45:07	D-Rez	AITA For not wanting to videocall grandma almost every other day?	"Mum insists I videocall or phone my grandma almost everyday. I decided this was way too frequent, and we initially decided on alternating days. After a few weeks, we both weren't really happy with the compromise. Mum wants to return to it being a daily ritual, whereas I now think even alternating days is too much, once a week should be enough.

When my dad was alive, he used to call to his mum everyday. Since my dad passed away, that duty pretty much falls on my own mum and myself. The problem is, neither of us can speak the languages my grandma understands, and her English is extremely basic. Our conversations are almost the same every time: hello, how's the weather, have you eaten, how's great-aunt, repeat a bunch of phrases in Hebrew/Turkish/Farsi that she loves hearing, and pull some silly faces for her to see. I've checked, our conversations usually go on for 10 to 15 minutes, though the last one lasted just 12. She clearly loves it when we phone/videophone her, she cries an little sometimes. 70 minutes a week, every week, just repeating the same things over and over, almost verbatim. It's mind-numbingly boring.

Grandma's not simple, she was an engineer and still mentally sharp in her 80s. I don't think she's particularly lonely either, she frequently hosts tea parties for her friends, my uncle lives near her, and she has a part-time carer. But our chats probably are the highlights of her day, she sometimes cries when we say goodbye. My mum and my dad's mum get along fine, but grandma does not care about talking to her nearly as much as with me.

Mum says I'm being ungrateful for all the things grandma has done, and if my old man could have found the time to talk to her everyday, so can I. I feel mightily guilty, I loved my parents and grandparents, and she's right in saying she has done so much for me. But I decided to put my foot down, and I'm only going to call her once every Saturday or Sunday, and not the first thing I do when I get back home from work. In time, I hope she gets used to it, even if it's making her anxious now.

c20ot2	2019-06-18 10:41:04	ally-kattt	AITA for breaking off my friendship?	"This started a couple of years ago and ended a year after. However, I still think about this incident from time to time (I'm in college by the way). It probably seems childish since it happened in high school, but having my friendship end the way it did still makes me upset.

Some background information:
My friend and I, let's call her Katy, have been best friends since roughly 2nd grade. So, we have known each other for about 10 years. We had a friend group with two other girls and all of us were really close with one another. We told each other everything. 


Back in my junior year of high school, Katy had a crush on a boy, Johnny, that she met the first week of school, and told me about it. She told me we were in the same class and pushed me to get to know him a bit more. So, I became friends with him and before I knew it we became really good friends. A few weeks pass and Katy finally got up the courage to tell Johnny that she liked him. Unfortunately, he already liked a girl and turned her down. I thought it was a small crush and that she would get over it. That's not what happened. She became obsessed with him. 

At that time, I was still friends with him and we still hung out since we had the same classes. She started acting so differently, where she would say the same things as me and act the way I did. I thought it was weird at first, but didn't think much about it since we were good friends and sometimes what we said would rub off onto one another. However, I noticed that Katy's attitude shifted where she was really sensitive and uptight whenever Johnny would try to joke around with her. We shrugged it off, but it got worse.  It was to the point where Johnny didn't want to try and talk to her anymore. I thought that maybe I could get them to talk since she told me she still wanted to be friends with him. However, during this time she was dealing with self esteem issues, where she would cry and complain about how her mom would bully her and tell at her all the time. We all felt bad, so we tried to comfort her and compliment her when we had the chance. It was only during Skype calls where the three of us would talk and hang out since we were all doing homework. 

Katy ended up sending paragraphs to me, talking about how she felt whenever I would hang around Johnny. Basically saying that she  wanted to hurt herself because she couldn't be friends with him. She continued saying that he suddenly stopped hanging around her because he transitioned to me. 

Skip forward because this is already long. Basically, I figured out a year later that she was lying to us about little things during Junior year. Things that Johnny said to her, about events that she said happened. We didn't realize this until the middle of our senior year. Finally we ended it off since we couldn't take it anymore. 

However, she told us that we didn't even try to understand how she was feeling and that we were attacking her. Idk, were we in the wrong to cut her friendship?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c20myi	2019-06-18 10:34:42	rainororon	AITA for not whiting to be a father figure to a kid I have no relation to?	"This is an old story that I know makes me at least partially an asshole but I still stand by what I did. Also I’m on mobile so sorry for the format.

So when I was in my late teens I knew a girl who I was only friends with. She had a kid with a guy that bailed on her as soon as she got pregnant so unfortunately the kid had no father figure at the time this happened. The girl and I were fairly good friends so we used to talk a lot. She started getting into a really bad habit of trying to forcibly make me the father figure to her kid.

She would tell me every little thing the kid did with the most enthusiasm I’ve honestly ever seen regarding kids she would also try to get me to come over a lot to “spend time with me and my son”. I saw pretty quickly what she was trying to do and tried several times to let her down kindly after all we were friends. I felt bad for the kid but I didn’t have any obligation to be a father to him. 

Unfortunately she never got the hint and it started pissing me off and the inevitable happened. I lost my cool. I would like to mention that I’ve always been extremely even tempered and have rarely snapped at anyone and in general I’ve always been pretty friendly. But everyone has their breaking point. So anyway, I bitched her out and told her what she was trying to force on me what not only unwanted but rude. That isn’t the part that makes me an asshole though. I continued and said “I don’t give a shit about your kid. He could die tomorrow and I wouldn’t care.” Obviously that upset her and she stopped talking to me which I was honestly fine with. 

But then maybe five months later despite what I said to her about her kid she started talking to me again as if nothing had happened. I even made sure that she remembered and she said she did but she forgave me. She would still kinda talk about her kid but she never did that again. 

Like I said I know what makes me an asshole and I stand by it even ten plus years later and I would do it again. But I guess I’m just curious if I’m as much of an asshole in regards to that as I think I am."	Asshole	0	0

c20lvx	2019-06-18 10:30:59		AITA for wanting to go across the world for university?	"So basically, I'm an American citizen as I was born there and lived there for 16 years before moving to the country I am in today. I had already told my parents before we moved that I would return to America for university and that was that.  
A few months ago I got into a couple of American universities and told my parents, both of my parents were completely shocked that i had decided to go back to America despite knowing, as I've reminded them over the years, that my intentions were to move back.    
Well they never really forced me to change my decision and sort of accepted the fact. However, a week ago my dad bought the tickets and decided that the entire family was to move back and that I would be living with them instead of living in a dorm.  
The issue isn't that I won't be living in a dorm ( although it did diminish my excitement for university significantly), it's that my dad decided to move our entire family just for my university even though I really didn't want them to. And he decided to do that in the space of like 2 weeks. I feel horrible and selfish and have sort of started fearing my decision to move back because of the way it'll affect my family. Everytime i bring it up, my mom reminds me of how much they're doing for me and how I should be grateful and doesn't listen to my suggestion of staying here because she thinks i just want to live in a dorm and party all the time.  My parents also say that they cannot allow their child to move across the globe for safety reasons and the notion that they have to be there for their child etc etc.  On top of it all, none of my family members actually WANT to move back, they're only doing it for me.   
And I know i shouldn't care but the thought of all our relatives and family friends thinking of me as a selfish brat bothers me a lot.  
Tbh there isn't much to be done as my dad has already purchased the tickets but i just want to know if i'm the asshole.

She said that I should have already grown out of this phase, which I found very insulting as the hat is a way of expressing my identity. So I just said nothing, calmy looked her in the eye and said 'well your make up is over done'. She was quiet for a minute then told me I was being an immature asshole, and that it's normal for her to wear 'subtle make up' but not normal for me to wear my hat.

c201yw	2019-06-18 09:22:02	tattoo__ripf	AITA for telling a friend that her tattoo is a shit idea. also having some friends involved.	"throwaway as this could turn bad. 
I'm 20f friend is 21f 
there are 2 other people who could also be assholes. 

around 4 years ago I lost my mum in a car crash and was devastated, before mum passed she had this tattoo idea, it was a humming bird on a fig tree in certain colors. 
I decided that on my 19th birthday I would get it, i even got it on the spot mum wanted  it's my most prized tattoo and I love it. 
everyone knows what the tattoo means and how much I love it. 

my friend decided that she finally was ready to get a tattoo so I asked her to send me a photo of it. it is the exact tattoo, the only difference is the placement and some colors got changed around, but overall an exact copy of my memorial tattoo for my mum. 

I was annoyed and so asked her where she got her inspiration for the tattoo and she refused to tell me, I asked her why she would take a memorial tattoo I got for my mum and butcher it, she told me I can't have dibs on the tattoo, i then told her that her tattoo idea is shit. she then went to some of our friends to get them on her side and they agreed with me, telling her that her idea is shit and she is stupid for wanting to ruin someone's memorial tattoo. 

she has now blocked all of us on Facebook and is refusing to talk to us."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c201cj	2019-06-18 09:19:48	throwawayk1926	AITA for making my friend jealous?	"Okay here is the situation. I am a gay man and since a couple of years back I've joined a circle of friends and we have become very good friends. Among this circle there are two people that this post concerns. One is another gay woman, Bee, and the other is a straight guy, Mike. Mike and Bee goes back a long way (like pre-school age I think). Me and Bee has become very close friends and we are both very physical with each other as in we hugging, playing with each others hair, cuddle up while we watch films and such, in a very platonic way (since we are both gays we have 0 sexual or romantic feelings for each other).   


Now to the issue at hand. Mike came and talk to me a couple of weeks back where he said I need to stop touching Bee, hugging her etc because she does not like it and it makes her uncomfortable. This surprised me because I've never gotten that feeling that this was the case. Natrually I wanted to talk directly to Bee, and apologize if I ever made her uncomfortable. She did tell me that this was not the case, but she had talked to Mike in the past, that she felt that he developed feelings for her and she had told her that him being physical made her uncomfortable, but she had no issues (the opposite in fact) with us being physical on a platonic level.   


Thinking back this explains alot. Mike has expressed a very protective stance towards Bee in the past, and has always percived grumpy in the past when Bee does not sit next to him when we watch movies or stuff like that. This has led me to the conclusion that he still have feelings for Bee, and that us being physical triggers jealousy and makes him angry/grumpy. Natrually  I dont want to cause a conflict or unecessary friction, but I also dont want to stop being physical with Bee.   


So would I be the asshole if I just ignored Mike and continued as normal?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c1zzdw	2019-06-18 09:12:20	PutridProtection	AITA for working from home, less hours than BF and still doing 50/50 chores split?	"My BF works full-time in the tech industry. I, on the other hand, am a freelancer: I work from home, Mon-Fri (I make the effort to work more on Friday to clear up my weekend). However, even though I'm doing this full-time, I only work for about 2-3 hours a day + 1 hour of liaising with clients.

This means that, while BF leaves a 8.30am and is back at 6pm, I'll be done with my work at 1pm the latest. We have separate finances and I make more than he does (at the moment - freelancing is very unpredictable but it's been like this for a year).

We have an equal split of chores. I'm the better cook so I often cook evenings and I do the meal planning, while he shops groceries on his way back, and washes the dishes. One thing I do more is laundry because I'm at home - I would put it in the machine when I get up, get it out and hang it to dry after I've finished work.

That being said, it was brought to my attention (not by him) that I may be the AITA. I work less hours, work from home (which means no commute), and while my BF comes home pretty tired at the end of the day, I'm well-rested. Should I be doing more things around the house since I essentially have my afternoons free?

So, basically AITA for working less hours, from home, and doing a 50/50 household chores split with BF (even though we make roughly the same money)?

**EDIT:** There have been quite a few comments about this so maybe I should've explained it a bit better: technically, we split chores 50/50. However, I'm usually the one to deal with the laundry (putting it in the machine, hanging it out to dry, and then putting it back in the wardrobe). I also change towels/sheets. I know it's not that much but these are smaller things I do around the house because I'm home all day and it's easier this way :) Not sure if it changes things much but just to mention it."

2. History of drama with this couple (not towards me but with each other)
3. I don't really want to get myself involved in other peoples business

other points that may be important: they have been together for 11 years and have a child together, live together etc

I know I’m probably the asshole but here goes.
Me and this girl have been dating for about 8 months. I met her maybe a year ago initially. She is a very modest person. The closer we are getting the more i am finding out about her. Fast forward a couple of months I notice she has A LOT of leg hair. She was very self conscious about it and would only wear pants in front of anyone. Including me. She never had shaved, so it’s a lot and it did surprise me A LOT. I have never even seen a women past a couple months not shaven. So this was a surprise. However I didn’t really mind. 

Now she is on the fence for shaving or not and asked if I would like it. I said yes it is something I find more attractive than i shaved legs. I told her honestly. She started talking about how I just think that because it’s a western ideology and all that stuff and now she doesn’t want to shave. She doesn’t say if it looks bad or good to her. She just says she won’t do it now because I think she’ll look better. 

I don’t know how to think about this, because honestly it’s a big deal to me. I never thought of a girl having that much hair, she says she has PCOS so it makes her more hairy. I get that and I always offer her help manage her unwanted hair. She says there’s too much and never lets me help. I’m trying everything to help her and make her feel better and also help me feel good when we are touching each other. Her hair hurts, mine is smooth but hers is long and kind of sharp. And she agrees and always hides it. If I’m an asshole I understand I can open my mind more. This is just a lot for me to take in at the moment. I am trying my best to say nice things to her. But it’s hurting my head. I am willing to change, but right now it’s a lot.

Edit: I’ve talked to her. She said she was in the wrong because she said she wanted to shave first and then I agreed and wanted it. She said she will work on either planning out how to handle the shaving/waxing or try to be comfortable with the hair. As long as she can be herself with me I don’t care for either at this point."

So my (21F) boyfriend (22M) of 3 years has a complete passion for singing. He really is trying to get into writing songs and performing them. 
Which is great and I really want to support him and be his number one fan in everything he does but the problem is he’s not great. 

Sometimes he can hit notes that sound good but most of the time it’s very average and awkward to listen to him belt a song he thinks he’s nailing. 

His mom is always encouraging him to sing & talks about how amazing and talented he is. So that’s where I think he gets the sense of pride from. He does have so many talents but this just isn’t one of them. 

He’s done a few open mics but it’s always been so awkward and uncomfortable for everyone in the room but he doesn’t seem to see that. He’s also always singing (showing people his voice I mean) at social events we go to. 
I’ve also had the conversation to 2 of my close friends and they agree that he thinks he’s better than it is & it does get very awkward when he’s showing people his singing abilities. 

I’ve told him before to record himself singing and listen back to it but he thinks that the microphone doesn’t capture his voice well & got really hurt and angry at me when I gently said that’s what he sounds like. I’ve also suggesting singing lessons just to hit the notes perfectly (like all great artists do, I think?) but he’s not interested. 

So, would I be the asshole if I told him that he’s not that great? Or should I continue to let him sing in public and on stage?

c1zir1	2019-06-18 08:06:49	tractor11116666	AITA for kicking my newly immigated relative out of my house?	"Back in Januarry, my brother and his family came to the State as immigrants from Asia. The family stayed in my house with my family for a month and then all but their oldest son (let's call him A), which is 18 years old, came back to their home country. I let A stay in my house until his parent come back here, and during his staying, his parent pay me 1000/month as a ""rental payment"" and asked me to take care of him, which I agreed.

A is hard-working, well-behaved and overall a great kid. The only negative thing about him is that he is very quiet. During his staying, he'd go to work, and then go back to his room, occasionally, he'd go for the gym, and he rarely talked to anyone. Because of that, he did not get along well with my children, which were born and raised in the US and roughly the same age as A. My oldest had a job and an apartment, and my second was staying in dorm. My second told me that he was uncomfortable with A and hence, he didn't really want to comeback home on the weekends, which he had been coming home every 2-3 weeks. Fast forward a few months, A's mom told me that their family would not planning to comeback to the State for a while. Knowing that, combine with what my children told me, I asked A to moveout.

I gave A a week to find a room, sort things out, pack and moveout. He already got a job as a barista at Starbucks so I wasn't too worry about his income, and I believe he had few hundred bucks in saving. During that week, I informed A's parent and they got pretty upset about my decision and hasn't talked to me since.

So AITA for kicking A out of my house?


EDIT: For specification, I did, too, feel uncomfortable with the fact that he did not talk to anyone and was being so closed off. We had dinner every night, and I tried to take him to places but it was really dificult to get him to open up and talk to everyone. When we ask him something or talk to him first, he'd talk back to us but he never initiated in a conversation with some exceptions like ""how are you"" or something like that."	Asshole	0	0

Of course I thanked him because he didn't have to buy me anything and it was a nice gesture from him, but I can't stop thinking that he could've put a little bit more of attention and find something (even cheaper) that I would've appreciate a lot more.

c1zhxn	2019-06-18 08:03:23		AITA for not wanting to speak to my grandma anymore?	"Little backstory- I just graduated from high school. During my freshman and sophomore year I lived with my grandparents due to family issues. I’m incredibly grateful that they were willing to let me stay in their home and take care of me.  Unfortunately, my grandma and I could never really see eye to eye. Her parenting style was a lot different than I was used to and I wasn’t accepting of it at times, so our relationship has never been close.


Flash forward to now, this past year has been rough. I’ve dealt with a lot of health issues and missed a lot of my senior year because of it. I lost 3 credits and had to make them up in an online class, but I wouldn’t be done before graduation. I didn’t have an exact finish date, all I knew was I had 3 weeks after the graduation ceremony to complete it. I asked my grandma if she would come to my graduation. She told me no, how I didn’t deserve to walk the stage if I wasn’t getting my diploma. It hurt to hear it but I left it at that.

At graduation, my mom dropped me off by the doors while she found a parking spot. I saw my grandma and thought she actually came, when I realized she was there for my cousins graduation that just finished (my cousin goes to another school in the same district.) I went up to her, dressed in my cap and gown, and she asked me what I was doing here. I told her my schools ceremony was starting in a half hour and she looked at me funny. I said my goodbyes to everyone and left to meet up with my mom after that.

The day after my graduation, I went back to school to finish my online class. It took 2 days and I picked up my diploma in the office. I normally walk home, but it was pouring rain outside so I had to call my grandma to take me home. I called my mom while I waited and have never heard her so proud of me, it was the happiest I’ve felt in a long time.

I got in the car and my grandma asked to see my diploma. I showed her and her immediate reaction was “why couldn’t you get this 2 days ago?” I didn’t say anything and she continued on saying some pretty hurtful things, how she really doubted me, etc.

In a way I understand where she’s coming from, she’s disappointed in me, but the way she handled it made me feel awful. My dad (she’s his mom) thinks I’m being ridiculous. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, but she has caused a lot of negativity during the past year, even in other situations. WIBTA for not wanting to speak/see her anymore?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c1zhu2	2019-06-18 08:03:01	childsupport1234	WIBTA if I uninvite my FIL to my wedding?	"So my husband didnt meet his dad until he was 22, so he doesn't really consider him a parental figure. TL;DR: father in law is gross, doesnt pay his rent, eats all my food, is rude to my trans child, and to everyone in general.

When we bought our house last year, FIL offered to move in with us to ""help"" us out.  I originally said yes, but only temporarily to get him on his feet closer to us. This seemed fair, but my FIL was extremely offended we didnt want to let him live and die in our house for more than a decade, as newlyweds no less.  He chose to move in anyway.

He moved his stuff in and immediately I noticed that all his stuff STANK. We asked him to wash all his layndry which he has still refused to do 4 months later. His room stinks up the whole house if he leaves the door open.  He blames everything else on the smell, and when I told him I didn't care what his excuse was he still had to clean it, he told my husband he needed to evaluate his relationship dynamic. 

After this event (as well as way to many smaller things to list here) my husband told him he needed to make other arrangements.  He said in order to do that we would need to drop his rent $200, which we agreed to.  But, he didnt pay even his reduced rent this month, claiming his social security got cut off, but didnt even bother to warn us.  This put us in an incredibly tough spot.  On top of it, he has started eating mass, inhuman amounts of the food we bought to feed the 4 of us (that does not include him, he is responsible for feeding himself), and we cannot afford to buy more groceries. 

On top of all this, my step kid just came out as a trans girl, and he has been incredibly rude to her throughout the process, making jokes and generally refusing to understand or even attempt pronouns 

Lasting, he undermines our parenting at every turn.  Based on very poor decisions made by FIL in the past, such as MOPPING THE BATHROOM FLOOR WITH TOILET WATER AND MY BROOM, my step daughter has been told he is NOT in charge EVER.  Me, my husband, and our roommate are in charge, if one if us hands out a punishment (today it was go to your room because you're biting your nails and have been told to stop 3 times, from our roommate) everyone is supposed to back each other up.  Well FIL walked in today and told my step daughter she was ""forgiven"" for the nail biting.  We also homeschool as our local school was NOT a good fit.  I would tell my step daughter what she was supposed to do for the day, and FIL would throw her off track and make her do something else.

c1zcwf	2019-06-18 07:44:17		AITA for telling my mother that I don't want my maternal grandfather to stay with us?	"It's the summer, and usually during this month, my mother typically invites her parents (my maternal grandparents) over to my house for a month or two before they go back. For the past year, my maternal grandfather has become increasingly annoying with me. I'll try to explain the situation as much as I can. 

On one fine day we host them over, I sit down to have dinner cooked by my mother. He then looks at me and says, ""Come along, have some more."" I tell him that I'm fine and I don't want to have anymore, and then he continues to insist until I have to work around and say ""I'll have it later, okay?"" And it just doesn't end there. It even continued in a Lebanese restaurant where when I finished whatever is on my plate, he then said ""You will have my falafels"" and then shoves his plate into my face and shakes it, telling me to take it. I then say, no thanks and when that didn't work, my dad had to tell him to stop, and he stopped. 

On another day, I'm just coming back from work, getting ready, having a shower, and I see him, standing right outside my bathroom door as soon as I open it. I was honestly weirded out by this because I've never seen any family member do that to me before.

Then one day, when I'm sitting by myself, he then asks me several questions such as ""How much do you make in a month"" and ""Do you have a girlfriend"". At this point, I'm genuinely annoyed with his shenanigans, and I tell him to mind his own business. My mom then pulled me over to the side and told me that I was being rude and I shouldn't have said that. I told her that he's being incredibly nosy and annoying, and someone had to say something to get him to back off. 

Fast forward back into the present, as soon as my mom tells me she's planning to invite them over, I immediately oppose the idea and tell her that she shouldn't invite my maternal grandfather around, owing to the weirdness he caused.

The second to last time he asked me to do it and I said, “holy shit fuck no”. Which I admit is rude, but I was frustrated, as I’d already told him repeatedly I wasn’t going to move it. The last time I said, “you can’t force me to move it by not doing it yourself, you’re gonna get a ticket” (he knows this, we’ve lived on this street for over a year). He told me to fuck off, so I didn’t wake him up again. He never asked me to in the first place but I definitely wasn’t gonna try again if that was the response. This morning he was hit with a ticket since he didn’t move his car and he’s infuriated with me. I’ve moved it in the past, but I just don’t want to anymore. It’s too scary for me. I have a suspended license and will go to jail if I’m caught driving, on top of charges I can’t afford. He wants me to pay for half since it’s “our” car, but it’s his fault this happened. He’s mad because the distance to move it was small, but I don’t want to risk going to jail because he’s lazy. 

TLDR I can’t legally drive and boyfriend told me to fuck off when I said to move his car, so I didn’t wake him up again or move the car and he got a ticket"		1	0

c1zb8f	2019-06-18 07:37:55		WIBTAH if I got a subletter for my apartment next year?	"I’m starting a pretty competitive graduate program next year and I’m already stressed about it, so please bear this in mind. I also haven’t discussed this issue with anyone except one close friend. 

For the last two years, I’ve lived with the same girl. She’s a nice girl, she’s quiet, no craziness, and she’s also fairly trustworthy. I am in no way trying to bash her character here. 

The problem is that she’s extremely cheap and never, if rarely, cleans the apartment. Occasionally she’ll offer to sweep the floors, and maybe it’ll happen. So far, I’ve bought all the cleaning supplies and decorations for our apartment. I clean the apartment every time. The first year we lived together, she would leave her hair in the drain and wouldn’t pick it up after I asked her literally on a daily basis. Last year we didn’t share a bathroom (thank goodness) but there were times she would leave her dishes (we don’t share dishes so each one is responsible for cleaning their own) for WEEKS. Like one time she left them unwashed for THREE weeks, counting. Anytime I make a comment about cleaning she agrees, but won’t follow through. She’s not a MESSY person—she does t leave stuff around—but she’s definitely not a tidy person, either. 

Now for this upcoming year we decided to move to a cheaper place (she’s also in a grad program which she’ll finish by the end of this coming school year). She insisted the place be furnished so it wasn’t actually MUCH cheaper. But I (being an idiot at the time and more of a pushover) went along with it and signed a lease with her. We found an additional roommate, and this roommate seems like she’ll be nice enough, who would get her own living quarters anyway. The third roommate will be starting the same grad program as me next year, and she doesn’t really have any red flags or anything. And we’ve even talked about how excited we are to meet etc. 

The thing is, I’m more in contact with the new roommate than my current roommate is (since I found her and since we’re starting the same program). But at the same time after signing this lease, I’ve realized that while I could bear living my original roommate for another year, it would really be a huge test of self control and endurance. I’ll be super busy, and she clearly doesn’t care to contribute to cleaning or buying any shared supplies/she does the bare minimum, if that. 

Would I be the asshole for finding a subletter? And how should I even go about breaking it to the new roommate?"		1	0

In nursing, we have this thing called clinicals where we come in to hospitals to learn & perform hands on so we aren't complete amateurs after we grad.

Anyways, we're required to be there at 6:45 and our instructor and other staff emphasized that if we're late, we get sent home and have to make up the entire 12 hrs on another day.

Well, one girl came at 6:45 but our instructor counts the seconds too. Therefore, she arrived at 6:45:25. 
She gets sent home after having a very violent verbal argument with our instructor. 

Who was in the wrong here? Everyone that teaches us in our program emphasized on punctuality so I understand where our instructor is coming from? But it is technically still 6:45 when she arrived?

I don't know if this info is valuable but it was the girl's main argument when she brought it to the head of the school: there is no parking provided and we have to fight for parking in a big city street (Los Angeles)

c1z831	2019-06-18 07:26:26	Afifi96	WIBTA If I canceled my sister's debt instead of giving a gift for her birthday	"I started to keep notes of my day to day spending about two years ago, at the same time I also started keeping track of who was borrowing money and how much. I quickly realised that my sister's habit of ""borrowing money for legitimate reasons and not reimbursing that money"" quickly rose to a not insignificant amount, it currently sit at almost €500. I don't begrudged her or anything, because she doesn't have a steady source of income like I do, but at the same time she's an adult and should be able to manage her spending according to her means.

So this year, instead of giving her a classic gift, I plan to give her a partial debt relief. I haven't decided on the sum I'm gonna cancel, currently I'm planning to do about 100€. I'm making this look like an official document, with hand calligraphed title, and some jokes inside to lighten the mood. 

WIBTA if I cancel part of my sister's debt instead of giving a classic gift for her birthday ?

**Edit**

A few clarifications, yes she is aware of her debt and I make sure that it's clear every time she borrows money. I'm not putting simple groceries for the home on her tab. 

E.g. of reasons I lend her money : money for the cab, I paid for her driver license card, online orders I do for her because she prefer not to do herself,... You get the picture.

I didn't plan to do that in the first place,  but now I'm going to make sure not to give it in front of other people. And I'm adding normal gift things, but for a smaller amount and the whole thing will be more than I would normally spend for a gift (and [I'm not](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxd26n/z/eq5heay) someone who like giving or receiving gift in the first place)."

c1z67d	2019-06-18 07:19:58	amoofy	AITA for being annoyed at my boyfriend	"We have a 4 week old baby, and Monday was his last day on paternity leave before going back to work. He went for lunch with his friend I dropped him off there, he would be going for drinks afterward, I went out shopping. I got caught up shopping so I wasn’t able to make it in time to pick him up (5:30pm), he said it’s fine he’ll get the bus.

He lets me know his pals girlfriend would drop him off in 30mins (around 6pm), amazing (saving money woohoo!) I’m home waiting on him, times going on, no worries, probably the girlfriend is late getting them. He text to let me know his phone is about to die and he’ll see me soon. Cool he must be on his way!

7:30pm I get a message from the girlfriend, saying he will be an hour. This is the point I got annoyed, another hour?! I didn’t reply to her; I just sat in my fury waiting. He gets home (8:30ish) and is drunk, I wrongly accuse him of taking drugs, which he says he hasn’t so I accept this and let him know I’m annoyed how late he is and how drunk he is. 

I did get my back up, because when he is drunk he is very argumentative and unreasonable, his story of why he’s late isn’t adding up, I call him out on it. However this isn’t the reason for me being annoyed, I don’t mind the reason, I just want to let him know I’m upset, but I believe I went about it the wrong way as I already had my back up and my fury face on

He takes the argument the wrong way and believes I’m saying he’s a bad dad for it, he’s worrying I’m going to take the baby away (he has prior experience so this is a worry for him)  *im absolutely not saying this and would not do this ever* i explain this to him but he isn’t listening. It’s more so that it’s his last night and I would have liked to spend it with him, as well I was just sat waiting, 

I hadn’t eaten as baby has colic so doesn’t settle after 6pm, needs to be constantly held and back rubbed so I was relying on him getting in so we could swap and I could get some food and housework done (of course he doesn’t know this, but does know after
6 baby is very restless)

c1z48f	2019-06-18 07:13:08	Impish_not_Admirable	AITA for not talking to my(26f) cousin(27f) anymore because she annoys the shit out of me???	"A little background:

This cousin and I grew up pretty close because we're the same age. We lived on the same street and went to high school together along with several other cousins. She is the oldest of our cousins ranging from ages 23-27. After we graduated high school, most of my cousins moved to California where we have other family. Oldest cousin and I are the only ones left in hometown. We hang out every other weekend or so. I live with my fiancé and 3 daughters. She lives alone in the house she inherited after her father died in 2007.

Oldest cousin and I recently drove to California together to visit family. We took my daughters, but fiancé had work so he stayed home. She doesn't interact with my daughters much because they don't like her, but with this 12 hour drive to California, they were forced to deal with her. She constantly yells at them for the dumbest things. Example: my daughter(5yo) was falling asleep in the backseat and she yelled at her to wake up and not go to sleep. I was appalled and told her to leave her alone and let her sleep, but she argued about this with me for a good 10 minutes claiming ""she shouldn't sleep because she's gonna be up all night."" it was like 1pm... She finally stopped arguing but now my daughter was too scared to fall asleep. This cousin is mean to all of my daughters and it makes me very mad.

She also very much irritates me with her constant whining, bothering me, and stupid talking subjects. Example: waking me up to ask me if I'd ever go to a sex club. 

She told me she was worried she couldn't have kids and asked me hypothetically if I would be her surrogate. No, I wouldn't because you'd be a horrible mother. I would do it for any other cousin.

When we finally got to California, I was so annoyed and sick of how she was treating my daughters, I decided I couldn't stay here with her for a full week. I left after 2 days telling her there was an emergency at work. She had her car, so she'd be fine to go home by herself. I rented a car and drove myself.

One of my other cousins stopped talking to oldest cousin about a year ago, and I asked her what happened. She said she was sick of her selfish behavior and greediness. Then I started realizing how greedy she was. Example: my mother gave her $150 for gas for the trip, but cousin didn't even tell me and still had me pay for gas. This makes me mad because she literally doesn't have to work. Her house was handed to her, paid off, so is her car. She has minimal bills. My fiancé and I have 3 children and live paycheck to paycheck. 

So at this point, I'm really sick of dealing with her and don't want to pretend to have a good time when I hang out with her anymore. WIBTA if I just stop talking to her?

Edit: I forgot to mention another fucked up thing that I can't get over: she has been dating this guy for 1.5 years and has hidden his identity from me the entire time, claiming ""he doesn't want anyone to know we're together."" I didn't think about this much because whatever you guys are weird and I don't care. A couple months ago she called me out of the blue and was like, ""I want to get this off my chest"" and she told me this guy she's seeing is her coworker who I had a one night stand with years ago. I don't care so much about him, but the fact that this was the reason she hid this for so long... Irks the fuck out of me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c1z39u	2019-06-18 07:09:46	never_mind_its_me	AITA for not inviting an old friend to my wedding?	"Hello all. I (27F) got married to my husband (27M) a few weeks ago. We had a beautiful wedding with about 200 guests. Our guest list was made up with 75% family, 25% friends. My husband and I chose not to invite all our friends and even left out all coworkers because we couldn't afford it and we wanted to stay at a 200 count. All is well during the event and immediately after. We enjoyed our honeymoon for 2 weeks and then came home.

Through the grapevine, I heard that an old friend, who I had not invited to our wedding, is upset. This friend, let's call her Sara, and I have known each other since 4th grade. We grew up together on the same street. Throughout our primary school years and college, we would hang out periodically. I would go over her house, we would take walks around our neighborhood, and I even drove her to school for our last 2 years of high school. Once I went away to college and grad school, our interactions then consisted of rare texts and us waving ""hi"" to each other when I would see her on my street after coming home to visit my parents. You see, Sara did not go to college and she does not have a job. She stays home all day and does housework for her parents. Her life has pretty much been this way since we graduated from high school. I think an important thing to know about Sara is that she is slightly cognitively impaired (mixture of special and regular education classes during school) and has a few medical problems. Due to these issues, her parents limit her independence, even though she is capable of more. I don't believe she really goes anywhere by herself (this is important for later).Sara and I talked in the past about her wanting to have more independence, like getting a job or even getting her driver's license. I think what holds her back is her parents' fear but I digress. 

Anyway, I thought long and hard about inviting Sara to my wedding. A lot of our friends we did invite were old friends whom we kept in contact with (hell, the shortest relationship between my bridesmaids and myself is 8 years). Concerning Sara, yes we did talk every few months and I would occasionally say ""hi"" when I would come home from college. I talked about inviting her with my mother and she told me not to. Her reasoning was not only the current state of our friendship but also that she and Sara's parents DO NOT get along for reasons I won't explain here (I also don't really care for them). We both knew if Sara was invited, no matter how much I stressed that the invite was to be just for her, her parents would come too. So, obviously in the end and based in this and other reasons, we did not invite her.

I've always felt guilty about not inviting her and now I feel like TA since shes upset. I think that, based on our wedding count, friendship state and the situation with her parents, we still made the right decision. However, at times, I'm not so sure. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

At the ages of 9-12 I had a really chronic fear of being alone, alone as in I hated being in my own house alone as I was super scared that something would come out of a dark corner and snatch me and do really horrible stuff to me so when I was alone I would rush downstairs and watch some movies. But if i still had the “fear feeling” I would call my Nan.

When I was 10, my Nan was diagnosed with leukaemia I got really sad because I already had one Nan who had died from cancer. I also knew that I wasn’t able to call Nan for any help. Luckily I wasn’t home alone much. Until when I was 12


Basically, my mom and dad were going to a play and my brother was going on a big hike. So I had nobody to call but my recovering Nan at home.

So a few days ago I found my best friends gf’s nudes on reddit. This is crazy because there’s a similar post on this subreddit about a similar situation like this.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bye16k/aita_for_masturbating_to_naked_pictures_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app
And I read the comments because I feel like I’m very indecisive of what I should do. I know my best friend of around 7 years enough and this sort of stuff crosses his boundaries (and mine too). Unlike the link I provided you guys with. I did not masturbate to her reddit, I didn’t tell anyone yet and I have the power to leave it alone but I’m not sure if I should. She does try to be anonymous I can tell, and if you dig just a little bit you can find her face (I only did to see if it was actually her). The only thing that’s keeping me from telling him is that in the reddit post I linked, the OP was called an asshole many times because he shouldn’t have told her bf because it was her secret. And that she’s just having fun. Well his case might be different in many ways but a few people were saying how “when girls do these types of stuff it really doesn’t mean anything” and if that’s the case then so be it I’ll let it go but I’m really not sure, the stuff that my friends gf posts are verbally and physically provocative, she replies to some of the comments on her posts and I guess it hurts me because me and my friend are close, I basically see it as cheating so I really don’t know what to do.

c1yrdy	2019-06-18 06:28:56	burner4ne	AITA- For drenching the bed in sweat and waking my wife?	"Background: I sweat a lot and have always done since I was a child. My mum used to have to change my pyjamas, sheets and pillow half way through the night. As an adult,  it's not as bad but I still sweat a lot. 

My wife bought me this specialist anti-perspirant. It blocks the glands under your armpits and prevents under arm sweating. But it doesn't stop sweat from anywhere else. I also can't sleep uncovered. No matter what the weather. 

We are on holiday somewhere rather hot. My wife asks me to cuddle her to sleep. I tell her I'm already very hot. She tells me it doesn't matter. I told her I'll end up falling asleep on her pillow, she says she just wants to cuddle.

I'm woken up at 3am by my wife shouting at me. She tells me I've made the whole bed wet and her pillow is soaking. And I've done nothing to prevent this as I haven't used the under arm stuff.   I also like to sleep covered and she's annoyed by this too.

We're not really talking as we had a full blown argument about it, in the middle of the night, before she moved to sleep at the bottom of the bed with her feet where her pillow usually is. She's really upset with me. And I'm annoyed as there's nothing I can do about this. Most of the sweat is from my head and my back. 

AITA? 

TLDR: I sweat a lot. This woke my wife up as the bed was drenched. Wife is annoyed as I haven't used my specialist under arm stuff and like to sleep covered. We've had a full on argument in the middle of the night."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c1yphl	2019-06-18 06:22:28		AITA for asking my boyfriend to not attend his best friend’s 21st birthday?	"throwaway, my bf uses reddit

This may get confusing: my best friend, Jen, is dating my boyfriend’s best friend, Mark.  My boyfriend, Bill, and I have been dating for 4 years, Jen and I have been best friends for 4 years. Mark and Jen recently met last year through Bill and I. 

3 days ago Jen and I got into a horrible fight. Details don’t matter but it made me realize Jen and I don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things. I apologized on my end and admitted to my weaknesses, but in my moments of vulnerability, she kept shitting on me. She also wronged me but excused it as “this is just how I am.” In the end of our conversation I expressed my disappointment and I haven’t heard from her since. All my friends feel she isn’t well intentioned and that I should cut her out.

Anyway, in 2 weeks Mark is having a huge 21st birthday bash that he originally invited me to. Yesterday he made the event and he didn’t include me, for the obvious reason that Jen and I fought, and she is a main guest at his party. I only realized I was officially uninvited because my bf told me about the event and group chat.

I have no idea what Mark thinks of me, or our fight, but I understand that out of respect for Jen, he uninvited me to his birthday. I told Bill that I feel in return, out of respect for me, he should also just not go, and let Mark know that it has nothing to do with their friendship. It would just feel shitty to me for Bill to show up alone and celebrate with Mark and Jen after they’ve cut me out of their lives. 

Bill 100% supports me, with what happened in the fight, my choice to stop talking to Jen, and agrees he should not go to the party. However I feel a bit like ITA. Maybe I should be the bigger person and get over it? It’s his best friend and 21 is a huge deal in the US. I didn’t tell him he *can’t* go but that I would feel pretty shitty if he did."		1	0
c1yp1a	2019-06-18 06:21:02		AITA for thinking my wife and I shouldn’t share rolls with the baby	"My wife and I recently had a baby, I haven’t really been off work because I wasn’t going to get paid for taking the time off. My job is quite stressful sometimes and has me working from7PM until 3AM but without fail every morning my wife wakes me at 6AM because it’s “my turn”. She asked me this morning why I looked like I was sulking and I told her that I’m exhausted. I can’t nap or anything during the day because I’m constantly having to clean and I just don’t have time. I can’t keep getting 2 hours sleep every night and she said to me that she did the night with the baby so it’s not her problem etc, our son sleeps from 9pm until around 3AM when we put him down. I said to her about money too because she’s getting paid for maternity then all sorts of different grants and allowance and everything on top but yet it’s me paying for all the food, diapers, wipes, and everything. 

I feel like when I’m working she should go to bed when the baby goes and just get up in the morning for a few extra hours.

I told my dad what happened and he’s telling me I sound like an asshole so I thought I’d ask her. 

I’m just frustrated and constantly exhausted to a point where I just feel depressed half the time now."		1	0
c1yogo	2019-06-18 06:18:58		AITA My GF got mad at me for being upset that half our night was spent trying to find a washroom for her	"Hear me out, I know the title sounds bad.

We've been dating a year, and both go to the same uni.  However, this summer I'm on a study term while she has the summer off(except for a couple art classes a week).  I'm not gonna get too specific for why I have to do this(I cant if people want more context), but I have to commute once a week.  However, this week I have to commute 4 times and its 3 hours each way.  Understandably, I'm incredibly drained from this commute and my work(Im in a rigorous program).

Today, I got home from uni at 9pm and at 11pm my gf asked to hang out cause she wanted pizza.  I obliged but reminded her how mentally exhausted I am and how tomorrow morning I have to wake up to do the same thing so I'll only go out for an hour or two.  She understands.  Now, we got our pizza's but the place closes, so we walk to the nearest mall(15-20min) and eat on a restaurant patio.  But, the second I sit down, didnt even eat yet, she says she needs to pee badly.  She says she just remembers and I'm like okay? we were just at the pizza place.

However, now its like 12:30am and nothing is open.  So, instead of calling the night early and her going home(she lives close to the mall) she gets upset at me saying that so we have to go find her a washroom.  We end up walking to the subway, and actually have to take the train to a station with a bathroom.  Im obviously a little discouraged because by the time we get back, we'll have barely 10 mins to eat before she has to catch the last bus back home(and I have to do work still and wake up early to commute)and the food will be cold.  Well, she sees this and starts kissing me.  I kiss back a little and put my arm around her(nothing else, i have pizza boxes in my lap).  She takes this as being distant, and confronts me for being mad at her over something like this.  I say I'm not but I'm just a little upset, not trying to be distant.  Well, after like 5 more mins she got mad at me for being mad at her for such a thing she cant control.  I understand but she made no effort to understand how tired I am and that I didnt really wanna spend my free time on more public transit.  She ends up eating half her pizza on the subway not really acknowledging me, then throws the rest out when we get out of the train going back.  

So I check the bus schedule, and argue a bit before it comes, but i see another one coming 30 mins later so I say lets reconcile this but she runs off to the first bus without saying bye of anything.  

We argue over text now and she says that the night was already ruined by me before she ate it and that she tried to fix it but I was distant.

Honestly, with my situation I think she could've been more understanding at how exhausted I am and could've saved her food and still come eat with me but she says that she would've done that if I didn't act so meanly.

AITA?  Let me know to expand on anything, and I will!  I'm just trying to figure out how much blame is on me for this one."		1	0

However the company I bought it from made a mistake and I now have two pairs of those headphones, while only having paid for one. I was planning on selling the second pair to my cousin at a heavily discounted price, but I've been getting a lot of shit from my family. 

They're saying I shouldn't sell it cause I didn't pay for it, and that I should give it away for free. My sister has also said I should give it to my mum or dad as a gift. But as I said, I don't have a job (not cause I'm lazy or anything I'm in my final year of high school and I've got no time for a job) and I could really use the money cause I don't have any source of income.

c1ymv0	2019-06-18 06:13:38	Illumnyx	AITA for abandoning a friend in their time of need?	"Potential TW below for abuse. Going to be vague with descriptions for sensitivity reasons.

More than a little bit of context required here. This friend and I have been close for the better part of a decade. We became friends in high school, and were always part of the nerdy crowd. As we grew up we stayed in contact and I visited them occasionally. Besides a 2 year period in which they'd removed me off Facebook for a reason I'm not aware of to this day, I'd say we've been pretty close. A couple of years after high school, they became embroiled in a case involving the abuse and death of a child. The friend was suspected of foul play, and despite this, I stood by them.

Fast forward a year or so, and the aforementioned period where we stopped talking happened. I eventually reached out to reconnect with them and we met for lunch. Things went well, and we basically continued the friendship where things left off. Over the next several years, they were officially charged by Police in relation to the above death and released on bail, which resulted in their unemployment and general ridicule by our community. Again, despite this, I stood by them. I made a point to visit them at least once a month and hang out, help out where I could (pay for food, entertainment, etc), and generally support them as best as I was able.

This became the norm until February this year, where after an altercation over message between this friend and another friend, I'd gone to visit them and returned home to find my other friends (not including the one who'd been part of the altercation) had things to say about how high a priority I was putting this friend over everything else in my life. I was told the numerous times I'd forgone plans with them to hang out with this friend, how I never seem positive when talking about them and how I'm always making excuses for their behavior. I was also told that the friend was saying some pretty disgusting stuff about me behind my back to my other friends.

It was at that point that I stopped reaching out to them, and restrained myself from doing so until it became habit. For two whole months I didn't hear a thing from them following that decision. Then on their birthday, they make the decision to block me on everything. That day I decided the friendship was truly over. Regardless of whether they're innocent of their charges or not, I'll never reach out to this person ever again.

As for the case, it's going to trial. But despite the fact I promised many times to do so, I won't be giving my time or energy to stand by them through it. I feel like despite what they're going through, they don't deserve my support or friendship anymore.

Most people I know have my back on this as they know our history and know I'm not one to give up on friendships easily. But I'm interested in seeing what a more unbiased audience thinks. Was I right to cut them off? Or should I have stuck by them as I promised? Am I at fault for sticking by them as long as I did?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c1ym05	2019-06-18 06:11:00	4DiscussionNotDebate	AITA I Sent My Brother To Jail And Feel No Remorse	"This is my first post, so please forgive any mistakes. 

Before I begin my story, let me give some context. I have several brothers whom I get along with but don't see that often. However, I happen to see this brother quite often (because we chose the same college), and he has acted rude to me for as long as I can remember with no known reasoning why. For the remainder of this story I will call him IB (intoxicated brother).

I had gone to IB's house one night because we were celebrating the last time another brother was in town after graduating college. When I arrived, I noticed IB was not present, but assumed he had gone out to get some food. Shortly after I arrived, IB showed up drunk out of his mind and carrying in some insanely expensive items. Although I won't be saying what was stolen for confidentiality reasons, let's just say these items are valued around 5k each and he had multiple. I kept going back and forth that night over whether I should report him or not because I didn't want IB's stupid decision to potentially ruin the lives of his current roommates. 

Skip ahead a few weeks, and I tell one of my friends what happened. He got upset with me for not calling the police immediately. The more we talked the more it made sense to me to report him. Well...I did. The very next day I'm contacted saying IB had been arrested and the goods were recovered and returned. I know I should feel bad, but I don't. Multiple years of passive aggressive side comments from IB about how I'm a shitty person, yet he is the one driving drunk, risking people's lives, and stealing highly valued property. Not to mention, I'm being offered a reward because of the report, which I will gladly be taking because college is EXPENSIVE. 

I would never wish for IB to get in severe trouble, but at the same time I almost don't care. I feel as if this incident wasn't important, they would not have pursued IB so quickly. But I guess we will see how this turns out."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm fine with this as the house is pretty big and I have a good sized room with an ensuite bathroom. What I'm not fine with is the expectations that are now being put upon me:  


\-No longer allowed to have my girlfriend around on weekends because it ""sets a bad example""  
\-No longer allowed to drink or smoke weed (legal where I am, I smoke in the unused external garage so it doesn't stink up the house or waft in through the windows) because, again, ""bad example""

\-Quiet hours now start at 7pm (lmao?) as that's the kid's bedtime

\-I took my nintendo switch out of the living room bc I don't want a kid I don't know touching/potentially breaking it. Apparently this makes me a ""scrooge""

\-Not allowed to wear my metal/goth outfits or have my tattoos exposed around the kid because, surprise, ""bad influence"" (the kid's mother is christian but I think the dad is just going along with it to appease her)

&#x200B;

Needless to say I refused to budge on any of these. Jared didn't take kindly to it though and my other roommate Mari (25F) says I should relax and let Jared have his way because it's only weekends and Leah is so happy to be able to finally see her dad regularly and as a human I need to respect that."

c1yl3y	2019-06-18 06:07:59	coolsoop	WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend if I could give him a facial?	"I want to ask my BF of nearly three years if I can give him a facial. He’s had mild to bad acne since high school years. Some background: we’re both 24, knew each other in HS but did not date until after we graduated. 

He thinks I’ve had good skin all my life. In HS I had great skin. But as soon as I graduated and moved away for college, my face blew up. Painful painful acne that would sometimes make me miss class because of the pain and the embarrassment. I suffered dramatically and didn’t talk to anyone my whole freshman year if I could help it. I got it handled through changing simple habits and getting on a prescription pill and lotion. I no longer take the pill but I use the lotion daily and give my skin weekly mild treatments. 

My BF does not take the necessary steps to remedy his acne. Other than quitting smoking and probably splashing soap on his face in the shower, I don’t think he does much else. I genuinely suffer seeing him pick at his skin or complain about an oncoming or lingering pimple because I feel for him. He doesn’t get that my wanting to help comes from empathy and experience because when he knew me in HS I had great skin and when we started dating I got my skin back in check. I think he thinks I’m doing it because I’m vain. 

I’ve offered him my lotions, even asking to get my prescription refilled and giving him the bottles so he can see if they help him (it’s a basic antibiotic) he always shuts it down and hates talking about his skin, I’m sure out of insecurity. 

Here’s the thing: he’s THE most confident person I have EVER met. He knows he’s smart, hilarious, and super handsome. He just has this one cosmetic issue. That I mostly view as a health issue. 

His looks DO NOT bother me. It’s the obvious one insecurity that he’s trying to hide that makes me sad. Seeing him in pain makes me sad. And after taking care of my own skin I learned I love giving other people facials and I would enjoy it and think maybe we’d have fun. I also do hope that if he saw the results he’d start taking the steps to better his skin himself. 

But I’m afraid to bring it up because I know that anytime I bring up his skin he shuts down and gets weird about it. I’m afraid to push it further and make him upset even if it may hugely benefit him. 

WIBTA if I brought up the fact I want to give him a facial? Or maybe how do I approach it without being an Ahole? Should I just give up?

Some more background: we are long distance at the moment and don’t live together, I can’t just bring it up here and there randomly, it would have to be when he’s visiting me and I have my things I need. Nor can I just expect him to fall into my routine, since we don’t have one together."	Asshole	0	0

c1yiwd	2019-06-18 06:00:36	BetterWing5	AITA for escalating a fight with my husband?	"Today, while grocery shopping, I admitted that for the last 2 weeks, we've been having our ""grilled cheese"" nights when he's not there. We have a rule in our house that you need to eat the crust. I back my husband up and do the whole fight with kids' tears even though I couldn't care less. I want us to be a team, so I help enforce the rule.

I told him that we've been having grilled cheese w/out him so I can skip the crust fight. He got pissed and said that he wasn't talking to me and walked away in the middle of the store.

He knows that when he doesn't talk to me, I get severe anxiety. My mom used to use the silent treatment as manipulation. She would get mad, not talk to you for days until you said she was right and she'd forgive you. 

I understand that when my husband doesn't want to talk, it's because he's angry and working things out in his head and isn't using it the way my mother did, but that doesn't stop it from bringing up all that anxiety. At the beginning I would go crazy when he did this- yelling, throwing stuff, anything to get the silent treatment to end. I've gotten a lot better with that and giving him his space and talking when he's ready to talk even though it gives me migraines and a lot of physical and mental stress dealing with it.

Tonight, I said in the car, don't make this a thing. We have a really nice night planned, don't ruin it over something as small as grilled cheese crust. I went into the bedroom when we got home and gave him some space so he could watch TV or play video games or whatever in the living room. This was like 8:10. He comes into the bedroom instead and lays down in our bed next to me.

I give it an hour and make a few repair attempts with funny posts on reddit or whatever. I'm getting nothing. So after another hour and a half of this, I go cry over ice cream and take a drive so that I don't get into crazy mode and start yelling and whatever. As I'm driving I'm just thinking about how stupid this whole thing is that he was trading our evening together to be upset over grilled cheese crusts.

I was getting really upset because I was really looking forward to spending some time with him after a really rough day dealing with family drama with my mom.

I go back and I try to get him to talk about it, no yelling, trying to understand what the big deal was. He told me to shut up and leave him alone and I told him I felt like he was telling me that I wasn't worth putting his feelings aside. It escalated and we were both yelling and bottom line was that I felt like he always takes care of himself first at the expense of my well being and then comes around and finally talks, and I was like, I put my feelings aside to give you what you need, when is it my turn? It turned a bit ugly and finally he took a sleeping pill and I'm awake writing this post.  I'm still really upset and feel like spending time with me should have been more important than grilled cheese.

So, a bit of back story. I work in a HEAVILY regulated industry (marijuana) with a lot of very harsh ID policies. I mainly work reception, so I am the most at risk for encountering fines/legal troubles for letting in a bad ID. The ""law"" says that ""if an average person could not say with complete confidence that that is the same person as the person pictured on the ID they can not be let inside"".

&#x200B;

The area I work in also sees a large amount of trans customers. Before, it was no issue. ""Amy"" shows her ID where she is very clearly still pictured as ""Adam"" but you still let ""Amy"" inside. No harm, no foul, but a few weeks ago we really cracked down on ID's and limited what was considered acceptable.

&#x200B;

So, when we were all standing around before the shift started talking about how the day will go I brought up this issue with management. Asking ""do we still let ""Amy"" in, if her ID still shows ""Adam""'?

&#x200B;

One of my coworkers (who is very openly gay) lost his shit on me. Calling me everything from homophobic to transphobic to a ""trash person in general"". He was in the middle of starting a huge rant on how I ""don't even give trans people basic human rights"" when I just walked away.

&#x200B;

Management flagged me down later and said that they ""didn't really know how to handle this issue"" because of it's ""sensitivity"" but not to worry because ""they're *hoping* nothing bad will come from this"".

&#x200B;

I don't really know how to feel. As a bisexual who struggled with identity issues as a child I go far as possible out of way to show the most respect possible for trans people as I know that struggle must be difficult as hell, but it took me way back to be told (especially by a gay man) that I was disrespecting the LBGT community.

I decided to take him to the local animal shelter because I had a feeling he was going to keep coming back and also because my wife has a lot of anxiety over dogs she doesn't know due to bad experiences she's had as a social worker.

The shelter told me they couldn't take him for reasons and I should make a post on facebook and print out flyers and also go door to door. 

I did none of those things. I took the dog directly to the police who then took him back to that same shelter. They posted this on their facebook page:

>Update: I'm home! 

>Remember, if a dog wanders up and is in good condition, check with ALL of your neighbors first before taking them to animal control or the shelter. The person who found this dog was instructed to do just that when they brought the dog to us - and we told them we would post it here and let them know if we heard anything -  but instead, they turned it in to local animal control. If they'd only taken our suggestions, they'd know that this dog lives just a few houses down! The owner called us first thing this morning!

If I explain it as ""there is a problem with my stomach"" they usually ask a lot of questions and it becomes a whole Thing.

c1yd6p	2019-06-18 05:41:55	Forloveandzen	AITA Didn’t tell family and friends about cancer until I felt in the clear.	"First off I’m good right now. Surgery and radiation seems to have stopped my body going all Kamikaze for now. 

I was (39m) when I got the bad news. Regular checkup caught a lump and after having a 2d image of my testicles explained to me, we sat and discussed options. Surgery and radiation were the best paths on the table in all opinions that mattered, so we set out to separate the boys and ‘fight back’ as it was coined. Fight we did I guess. I’m still ambiguous about my feelings on that part. I just showed up and let a big machine fire stuff at my junk for a few cycles.  I would assume I was or am still in shock about the whole ordeal to be so blank about any emotions but it is what it is. 

I had opened a private studio for art and tattooing about a year before and couldn’t take a lot of time off, so as soon as possible (3 weeks) I went back to tattooing. I modified my schedule through my therapy cycles and tried my damnedest to never let people know what was going on, personal or professional. I just worked through it all. 

“March forward and drink water”, as my Papa Bear would say. I just kept going, plain and simple. 

About a month after treatments had ended I slipped and said something to my best friend. He was shocked, then angry, then composed and problem solving. We talked until I part way understood that it was incredibly hurtful to not let the people closest to me into my chaos world at that time. While I didn’t and don’t understand it, people need to immerse and coarse themselves against the pain in others. They need inclusion as much as I would need a steadfast resolution. 

I called my close friends and family after that call and can only claim my state as quasi @&$#ed. Glad I’m alive, but pissed. 

My problem is, I don’t feel that they are justified honestly. I love my family and friends but I’ve always been raised to be a shield rather than a spear. In some awkward way, I have rationalized that my not sharing my body deciding to revolt against itself is justified. 

At the end I don’t feel either is right but that may be because I’m a high functioning Autistic. Black and white yo, sometimes with flairs or color I just don’t understand. 

It’s not whether I did the right or wrong thing, to me it’s being able to see both sides for a second and make the best choice. Did I?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c1ybst	2019-06-18 05:36:52		AITA: Friend (literally) talks behind my back	Hi fellow users! This is my first time ever posting on reddit so please bear with me! This event occurred during my senior year of high school  and I’m going to change the names/specific details since this didn’t happen too long ago. My friends and I, being typical high school students, didn’t like some of our peers. We sometimes differed on our opinions, but we always agreed on not liking this one girl (let’s call her Becca). Becca was the typical “popular” girl, not to mention the biggest narcissist ever. She had directly done something to each of us which seemingly justified our stance on her. One time she even said “I know I’m going to win homecoming queen because everyone likes me”. My friends and I would always joke around with each other about her. One day I decided to send a message regarding her recent achievements to two of my seemingly close friends. Unfortunately, I sent it over text message so there were receipts. Now, I know that it was not right of me to gossip about Becca, but it was (again unfortunately) something my friends & I did often so I thought it was okay. Anyway, I sent something along the lines of “This is only going to make her ego bigger” to my two friends Vivian and Laura. Laura responds with something like “Why are we comparing ourselves to others?” which is totally out of her normal gossipy character. (I later understood why she responded like this). The conversation ends shortly & I forget about it. Anyway, 7th period roles around. I sit in the front with my best friend Elizabeth while Laura and Becca sit directly behind us. We weren’t doing anything in class, so I put my headphones in & started working on my college algebra homework. I start hearing gossip behind me and I pause my music. Low & behold Laura is showing Becca my texts right behind me! I can directly hear their conversation & hold back my tears. Of course, Becca responded out of character so showing the texts would not jeopardize her. I confronted her on snapchat later and her direct response was “You should’ve known I was going to show her since we’re better friends than you and I”. Let me just say, she has never once hung out with Becca outside of school (I, however, have spent days on end with her) and she has always joined in on our groups’ conversations about Becca. I felt hurt and betrayed, but she claims she did nothing wrong.		1	0

He happens to be a very close family friend since my father is an eye doctor also. I made an appointment and was scheduling for next monday. I thought that was odd considering i’ve heard of a waiting list for this specific eye doctor and it was very soon. I told my sister this and she (who wears glasses and “prescription changes so much”) told me that i am selfish for accepting the date since there is such a long waiting list and refused to talk to “such an arrogant bitch” until i change the date. I’m only going in for a checkup i’m not expecting anything to be wrong even though i know i’m getting glasses.

c1yawx	2019-06-18 05:33:53	Darkroast_NoSugar	AITA For being pissed about this	"UPDATE: I apologized for being a massive asshole to her about this situation and managed to smooth out the whole situation. Thank you for enlightening me k was being a dick. 

So some background. My girlfriend has this friend who has a thing where he thinks he’s like an anime main character. In a group on discord they’re in I had vented about how I needed medication for my anxiety and depression but money is tight and people who promised me help didn’t help. GF’s friend decides to comment saying how meds don’t help everything and how he’s been on meds yet he’s still a mess and acting like he knows all, I’m three years older than this dude btw. I explain why I think meds would be beneficial to me but oh no, he think I didn’t tried hard enough. At the time I had gotten away from years of abuse for only like three years at the max so the trauma was still pretty fresh. He told me all my hard work to get where I was then was for nothing. 

I of course decided to take a break from the internet and in that moment my work crumbled and I genuinely felt like a failure. Once I get back on I have an apology from him.  

“I know you said you were taking a break, and thats fine if you dont see this right away, but i need to write this out to you specifically. I am sincerely sorry. This was no doing but mine, and my ignorance for your issues. I failed to ask you what was your reason for anxieties to try to help, and failed to recognize that you are right; I can't help you. Now, I can't even try. I'm a kid, 16, and all i wanted to do was give it my best shot. Nobody, and i mean nobody deserves to hear those kind of words from somebody whos trying to be their friend. If you would like to write me off, to block me, or to send me threats, i would understand whole heartedly. This was my fault and nobody elses. I am sorry, and will leave you alone forever if you ask me to. I am sorry.
Sincerely,
(His full name for some reason)”

I of course acknowledged the apology but it’s not how you go about telling someone they didn’t try hard enough after trying to get over years of emotional and physical abuse

Current day situation. I learned my girlfriend is still friends with this guy even after he hurt me so fucking bad to the point of feeling like a failure. She’s still friends with him because he apologized. 

Am I the asshole for still being upset and this situation and being upset at her for still being friends with him and saying he’s a good guy despite me getting hurt so badly?"	Asshole	0	0

Ex-wife is asking for an additional $550/mo to cover summer child care. I currently pay $1200/mo. My ex pays no rent, has no car payment, medical coverage through work, and a full time job as a manager in a national department store.  I assumed 100% of marital debt--that's a house payment plus around $30k of credit card debt so she could have a clean start. She fled the state after I told her I didn't love her and I was only with her because I loved the kids. She moved the kids the very next day, 800 miles away. I found out on my way home from work.  Quitting my job and moving isn't legally advisable for long-term considerations, so I have to save to either bring them to me or to visit them. She lives in a tourist area that is incredibly popular and expensive over the summer.  I'm angry because, if I pay, I have to put off seeing my children even longer. I'm living pay check to paycheck on a budget designed to pay down my debt to free up cash later.

But around 9 months ago my brother(19M) messed up his car for the 3rd time in a year. My parents would only give him so much because they paid for his car to be fixed the other times. Well he asked me for the money and I loaned(300$) it to him because he said he would pay me back 50$ every other time he got paied. Okay that would take time but it was whatever. I took the money from my vacation savings thinking it would be put back in right? Well it's been 9 months and I've only gotten 50 dollars back. While I'm not a busybody but from talking to my mom and observing my brother has bought expensive jackets costing more than 100$, my mom told me he took his girlfriend on a shopping spree and regularly buys her expensive clothes while giving me nothing. The reason why I want to hold his stuff as 'ransom'is because if I leave anything I own out side of my room he will throw it away. Such as a flightsyit for my bird, that costs 30$. He also threw away an AT&T 200$gift card valcher because it was ""where he sleeps"" which is the couch because hes claimed out living room meaning no one can go in there. He and his girlfriend also cook dinner at the house very often but only make enough for them self yet they use my ingredients and my things. Yet leaves the dishes for my mom or I to clean. And the last thing is I often but a 40 pack of water bottles to give my birds water. I just moved and am looking in to getting a water cleaner faucet thing. My brother drinks ALOT of them meaning I have to buy a few packs a month(compared to one 40 pack for a month and a half) when the water is ment for my pets. I see this as him taking even more morey from me! Due to this I want to start collecting his expensive cloths and just keep them in my closet or somewhere hidden and when he gives me money I'll give him one of his items.

c1y56m	2019-06-18 05:14:54	sssempiternal	WIBTA if I cut off someone without talking to them first?	"I’ll try to go into as much detail as I can but ask for clarification if needed. 

I [18/F] have been friends with someone I once considered my best friend [18/F] for the past 6 years since we were in middle school. We have grown apart and closer throughout the years but have never reached a breaking point at all. Until now maybe... 

My friend, let’s call her Jane, started a new job around the time of March/April and made new friends at work. We had a discussion about how it’s okay to have other friends and Jane tells me she doesn’t mean to abandon us. I let it go because I understand that shit happens. 

The first times I really felt abandoned were around the time Avengers: Endgame came out and I asked Jane to go with me an another friend (I paid for tickets and everything). She agreed to go, but then cancelled the day of the movie and we had to scramble to fill the other seat. Jane claimed she had to watch her nephew but later my other friend checked her location and found she was in a park with her other friends. I ignore it hoping it was a one time thing. However, it wasn’t.  Suddenly it was “I can’t I’m busy” anytime we wanted to hang out.

She claimed she had to work every time we wanted to do something, but she was never at work during the times she said she was. I honestly hadn’t really seen or hung out with her at all until our graduation at the end of May. Even then she ditched me and our other friends. 

I saw her again a few days later at her graduation party at her house, it was fun and I got to see her for a few hours. However, her other friends from work were there too, and they all just up and left her house to go out somewhere. Jane made plans right in front of me and didn’t ask me to go, she just left. Additionally, I found out she totally blocked me from her Snapchat story because she didn’t want me to see the stupid stuff she does. I honestly wouldn’t have cared but that’s not all she’s posting about! She’s posting cute conversations with her other friends about how they have contests over text to see them who loves each other the most! Adorable. 

To try to shorten this a little: it’d had been around two weeks since I’d spoken to her and she texts me out of the blue that she’s sorry she’s been such a distant asshole. So I respond that I understand that life gets in the way. 

We’ve been talking on and off for the past few days but there’s still this horrible distance between us and then I find out today that she took a joint Instagram account of us out of her personal Instagram bio and replaced it with the initials and hearts around her new friends from work. That sounds petty and stupid as fuck but it feels like the beginning of my replacement. I feel bad for not talking to her, but in my defense she doesn’t talk to me either.

So in short, would I be the asshole for cutting off my former best friend who doesn’t talk to me at all, and who seems to have replaced me with other people, before talking to her first?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c1y53z	2019-06-18 05:14:39	Sleepycoon	AITA for stealing my SIL's cats?	"Carla = sil, Ray & Bruce = obrothers

My brothers & I lived together, we all paid into a rent account that I paid all of the bills & got household items with. Bruce found a single abandoned kitten & we kept it. She got outside & got pregnant, two kittens were born in July, we kept them both. Around the same time, Ray's gf Carla started staying over most weekends. She loves cats & was excited about the kittens.

Ray got the kittens their shots, & eventually spayed. We'd have done that with the rent account, but when Ray's behind on rent he'd buy things for the house to make up. I assumed that's what this was, & figured he was trying to impress Carla with his pet owner skills, so I didn't question it. In Dec, Bruce & Ray moved out. Ray came by & got some stuff a few times, but I still had a room full of his stuff.

In Mar, while talking to Ray I mention the nearly a grand in back rent he still owes, & all the stuff still at my house. We get into an argument. Two days later I get a call from my dad, Ray asked him to go into my house without my knowledge or consent, take the two cats, & keep them. Dad thought it seemed fishy, so he called me. I am so distraught at the thought he'd steal my cats that I leave work & drive home to make sure all my doors and windows are locked. I confront Ray, we argue, he apologizes, and we make up. I keep the cats. I don't know why he'd want them to go live with someone else other than to spite me for yelling at him about the rent & stuff.

I talked to Carla about what happened & learned Bruce gave her the kittens when they were a few weeks old. Carla, not Ray, is the one that paid out of pocket for their shots/spay & all the extra stuff. She always planned to bring the cats with her once she & Ray got a place of their own. She thought I knew that & just decided to steal her cats. We talked, she seemed understanding, & I offered to work it out where she could have them. She declined, saying they're not allowed to have animals at the guest house. I offered to reimburse her for everything she spent & she also declined. I offered to ignore the back rent her husband owes me and just call everything even, she again declined.

A few weeks ago my best friend confronted me after talking to Carla. She's still very upset about the whole incident. She told him that she doesn't see me the same way anymore, can't trust me anymore, and no longer feels comfortable around me. He sides with her and thinks I was wrong & that I basically stole her cats. Her & Ray are both distant now. I feel like I'm being unjustly ostracized by my friends & family, but I really do feel bad about the whole thing & think I did my best to make amends.

c1y4sx	2019-06-18 05:13:38	OwnJudgment9	AITA for getting a promotion I didn't deserve or want, and refusing to give it up?	"Sorry if this sounds like a humebrag, not what I was trying to do.

&#x200B;

So I attend a military-type school, which is modeled similarly to West Point. Like in West Point, one senior is chosen by the headmaster to be 'First Captain': basically the student body president, but with far more authority and respect involved, since they make major decisions that impact the lives of the student body (with permission from the headmaster). The headmaster, Dr. Parker (not real name, but he does have a PhD) is a former Army Colonel. I'm a rising senior, and the First Captain for next year was just announced.

&#x200B;

The guy everyone expected to be First Captain, a friend of mine, is named Kyle. Let me give you a brief rundown of him as a person: he comes from a line of military officers, joined the school to prepare himself to also join the military, 3st ranked academically, captain of the lacrosse team and head of the drill team, 1st in physical training (mile time, amount of push/pull ups and crunches, amount bench-pressed, so on and so forth), and has zero demerits (basically think detentions). 

&#x200B;

Now, let's take me: I got put into the school by my parents for disciplinary issues as a kid, because they hoped it would teach me discipline. I'm 1st in my class academically, but very mediocre in physical training and have a whopping 17 demerits. Mostly for sneaking out to meet girls and throwing parties. I'm not significantly involved in any clubs or activities aside from the Prom committee and investing club. I spend most of my free time hanging out with friends, trading stocks, or learning stuff  that'll help me as an investor: macroeconomics, accounting, programming, global politics. I plan a career in finance, not the military.

&#x200B;

As I mentioned, the First Captain was announced, and although everybody thought it would be Kyle, turned out to be me.  Kyle confronted me about this, and asked me if I was going to Dr. Parker to tell him I don't want the promotion. His reasoning was this: I don't care about being First Captain and don't deserve this since I obviously have disciplinary issues and spent most of my time hanging out with friends instead of working. For him, the promotion means e verything, and he sacrificed everything else- fun, friends, having an unstressed life- to get the promotion. So he deserves it. Besides, not knowing anything about the military, I'd probably mismanage and make everyone miserable.

&#x200B;

I agree with him to an extent. I don't care about this promotion, and he obviously does. But I figured, if I was chosen, it's probably for a reason. Dr. Parker has years of experience, so he probably had a good reason to choose me. So I should roll with it, see how it goes. I told him this.

My father has always been a hard-working man who put his family needs before his and as result I have always had a deep admiration of him. However our relationship has not always been perfect as he and I are very stubborn and tend to think we are right. I know this is a serious flaw and I have made serious attempts addressing this hence why I made this post hoping I'm not just sticking to stubbornness.

About two years ago I bought my father a tablet. After showing him how to use it he began exploring the internet and found Dr. Edmundo Velasquez founder of Escuela PNL which translates to school of Neuro linguistic programming.To give this guy some credit some of what this guy's ideas were infact very wholesome and practical. Things like taking responsibility for your actions and how to own your failures and some of the things he said resonated with my father.

However I never really trusted ""Dr"" Edmundo. For as much wholesome information that he was giving he was spewing as much b.s. he kept referring to his teaching as begin world famous and made tons of unverifiable claims. He said that you could inlist in his online program and obtain a degree that would be not only recognize in Mexico and the U.S but in Europe.
Fast forward to a month ago. My father starts asking help with setting up accounts on different websites.I was taken a back but I decided to help him out as best I could. I asked him why and he said he had invested 2k in a business opportunity that ""Dr"" Edmundo was giving his students. The 2k was an investment in the ability to buy crypto currency that the good doc was about to launch to the public in a few months at half the market price. The investment was also him buying into his business where he would be given a website that would sell the good doc's lectures and my father would receive 50% from the sale and would receive 20% of the revenue from people he signed up.  On top of that he would be given the ability to buy some sort of device that would turn water to medicine through vibrations. ( I am dead serious. Vibrations.) Oh and signing a power of attorney form for some websites that would have his banking info. I couldn't believe what he was saying but my father was so elated and what I found out was that he sold his business.

 A week ago he was told to sign up for tradeview.com and  to sign a power of attorney over to the doc's. My father said he needed my help running his business because he didn't know how to use technology and I said I would not because I felt like he was being conned and I didn't want to be a part of this. I told him I was more than willing to help him do anything but this. I could create a website for him and help him run his business but he decided to withdraw from this business venture. 

He seems really down about this and hasn't really spoken to me. My mother says I should have just helped him out. Now the question am I the asshole."	No A-holes here	0	0

Then I get there and he’s with a friend of mine that had previously been very mad at him, since they had hung out, gotten drunk and did shit together. She wanted a relationship from him. He didn’t. But there she was. I was confused. I keep trying to ask him about it and what this meant for like me and him and he avoided the question until he finally texted me that they were dating. And I had a 45 minute panic attack in the bathroom of the restaurant feeling like absolutely garbage. My friend that I drove down with heard this junk after I just left the restaurant. And we left. No weekend. No hanging out. We noped out of there. I yelled at my friend why that was a completely shitty and manipulative thing to do to my feelings 2 days later on discord. I then messaged his girlfriend, who had been my friend before this of why it was incredibly hurtful that she didn’t tell me anything at all. She apologized but it still felt extremely shitty since she knew exactly how I felt however is claiming she didn’t. It’s been about 2 weeks since this. And I’m still hurt by him. But he keeps blaming me and telling me I need to make him with her. When I told him that she can talk to me but I’m not reach out to a person I don’t see emotional value in. Because we were never close in the first place. Am I the asshole for not wanting to talk to her first? I really don’t think I am. But I feel fucking shitty. Her issues about not reaching out is her issues not mine right? They’re the ones that hurt me? Any advice would be nice."		1	0
c1y2gm	2019-06-18 05:05:46	maxkravts	AITA for using a handicapped parking space when my disability does not limit my mobility?	I lost my arm 2 years ago and wear a prosthesis now. I've received a handicapped placard for parking, but I typically never use it. I always feel like I'm capable to walk like anyone else and there is probably someone in bigger need of this space than me. However, I've used it a few times recently when I was in a rush or there were no other spaces available. My rationale is that with a missing arm, it does take me much longer to do many things, and so this kind of compensates for lost time. Also, I was allowed to receive the permit in the first place. However, I still have a guilty feeling when I park in the handicapped spot, and that there will be an elderly person or someone in a wheelchair coming, and I took their spot. AITA?	Not the A-hole	0	0
c1y1fe	2019-06-18 05:02:25	Unique_Username115	AITA for calling out my uncle in not contributing for family overall?	"My mother as well as my brothers and I had left the house we had lived with our dad for 12 years because of an affair at April 2018, but that's for another story. On May 23rd of this year, we're back along with one extra person, our uncle. May 31st was when I graduated HS, it was also the month I turned into an adult and my uncle gave me money ($80) for congratulations. I didn't want it but took it anyway.

Although my uncle pays for his own things such as hygiene products, he doesn't help contribute with us. He would work and use that money on the casino, as my brother drive him there.

My parents and brothers weren't exactly ecstatic that we have a working adult that doesn't help here. We got home, and everyone's home, we ate. ***My mom asked my dad and him about working as an aide for the elder, as it is less stress and work. My dad could watch his mother, as she's very old but still strong. My uncle then said, jokingly, ""He don't want to do that kind of work, it's boring. If he did, he would kick the elder out of the wheelchair.""*** ***He brought up the fact that he's good with his money and that he doesn't need a job like that. I said: ""I mean, when you're not going to help contribute, eating food from us, and gamble your money away, then yeah, I guess you don't.""***

***He thinks that we want him to pay up right now, but we would never ask. I said*** ***""Look, uncle, we don't enjoy feeling like shit, so we don't expect anything. If we did, then we wouldn't have let you back when you were from Minnesota 2 months ago."" He replied, ""How much fucking money do y'all want then? I gave you money for graduation, I pay y'all when we eat out, I buy y'all snacks, and that's not enough? I don't got the money right now, but tell me how much because I don't like being called no fucking bum."" He shouldn't do these things because you feel like you have to, but because you genuinely want to.***

He then said ***""This is your dad's house not yours, we not family if we can't treat each other like one"".*** My brothers said ***""You should be lucky that you're living under a roof to begin with.""*** We decided to let dad figure out what should be done. Pop says ***""You're not a kid, you're an adult. You can work, and they're not asking much.""*** Uncle called us rude and blind, and told his brother that he needs to respect their elders. My sarcastic remark was ***""Dad, I'm so sorry for being bad. I deserve to be punished, please discipline me so I can be a better person towards my contributing uncle.""*** He went back to sleep. And now, here we are.

TL;DR Everyone called out my uncle for not helping contribute for the house, and it lowered morale to everyone for the day. I happen to offended him by implying that he's a freeloader that doesn't help us and gambles his money down. Obv., he's just one person, but he's not contributing even a penny at all.

Currently, I’m nursing a shin stress fracture that I got a month ago (incase you don’t know, stress fractures take about 1.5-2 months to heal; i’m giving myself 2.5 months to heal). As a result, I play a good amount of xbox, 4-6 hours to be exact. 

If I was healthy, I would definitely go out and do activities. As of right now, the only activities that I can do without hurting myself are working out, swimming, walking, biking, and playing basketball (“shooting hoops” to be more exact). 

Back to the video game thing, I’ve been playing a lot of video games. I play Rainbow Six Siege and Minecraft, both with my friends. R6 requires more communicating than Minecraft, but our Minecraft server usually has 5-7 people on it at a time. Anyways, I usually am talking to my friends as I play, which means a lot of talking to my friends.

My girlfriend is pissed about this. While I almost always am on the Xbox, there’s not much else I can do. I’ve tried telling her that we can just facetime at night when I’m more able to facetime, but she keeps wanting to facetime me during the day. In her words,  “You are always on the xbox “with the boys,” and never talk to me.” While that is true to an extent, there isn’t much else I can do besides play Xbox, and I make an effort to talk to her at night.

I have attachment issues. He has a macabre sense of humor. We have two cats one dog. The dog is being trained to help with my PTSD. The more we work together the closer I begin to feel. 

I hate chihuahuas. He loves them. I found a funny video talking about purebreds and making fun of the extremes. Chihuahuas were in it. He has a childhood chihuahua that died and it hurt him. 

He hates cats. He jokes about how much he hates them. He jokes about killing mine and eating them and all that but it's jokes. I had a cat that died recently and it hurt. He jokes about the dead cat, i don't mind. 

We watch the video. He gets offended at the chihuahua part. I joke about chihuahuas being hellions and that they would make good bbq. He looks at the current dog that I'm training and says that he would choke the life out of {dog} to have three days with his old dog. I'm tired of his jokes.

i read a lot of AITA posts and this may be one of the few where the person in question have no idea what i’m doing? okay let’s get started. 

i have had a foster brother since i was about 8 or 9 maybe (i’m almost 21), but i’ve never really thought of him as a brother. he’s always been kind of rude and disrespectful to my parents so i just never really liked him ( i did as a kid but i only knew him for about 2 years and didn’t see him until 6 years later i think). me and my family lived on the east coast and he and his wife moved there a few years after us. two years ago my family and i moved to the mid west, FB (foster brother) stayed on the east coast. queue three months ago, and he and his wife have been having marriage and money problems, so they decided to move in with my family in the midwest. 

so now it’s me, mom, dad, brother, and FB, his wife, and their two rat children. and my beautiful dog. my house isn’t that big, it has a lot of rooms but we have a closed floor plan so every room has like three walls so it’s like veryyyy closed off (the house)

ever since they moved in, they fight. every fucking day. about stupid shit. and the day the moved in, i would listen to them fight. normal people go to a room to fight, but since every room is occupied they decide to fight in the middle of the house in the living room. so i would just sit behind the couch and listen, or pretend i’m watching tv on my ipad but the volume is down so i’m just listening. everything i heard that they say i tell my parents and my sister. they’re both (FB and wife) shit people and have made/make shit decisions so i love to listen and gossip to my mom. 

( one thing she did recently was leave both her kids in the bathtub alone and when her 2 year old started to choke on water and throw up, she blamed her 4 year old for not telling her (the mom))

AITA for listening in and telling people what they do and say? my thing is, it’s creepy sure but you guys are living in my house, very disrespectful to me, my parents, my DOG, i think it’s alright that i secretly listen to you. you talk and fight in my living room, which is in the MIDDLE of the house, i feel it’s a little okay lol.

I told her early on that I'm poly and we've made references to talking to other people. 

Recently I met one of her friends and had an interesting/good conversation; I found her attractive, and she's also in a better spot emotionally for a relationship. Since the hookup has been in a rough patch, I opted to try talking to her about my interest before pursuing anything, and she got super offended and mad at me, going of about crossing a line, breaching her trust, etc. because I would show any interest in her friend.

On the night of the wedding rehearsal, she tells me that her family has taken over her home and she has no where to stay. Then she says another bridesmaid is coming into town at midnight with also no where to stay. I take the cot. They take the queen sized bed. 


Not a single thank you or offering to pitch in for the $875 AirBnb. 

The next morning, wedding morning, I wake up to my entire body hating me: chills, fever, weakness, vomiting every 2 hours. I drive to the grocery store to get saltines and 7up. I have to run out of the store to vomit. I get back to the AirBnb ill as fuck, unsure of how I am going to make it through this day as a bridesmaid. 

A few hours go by and it’s time for the bridesmaids to head to the hotel to begin the process of getting ready (hair, make up, photos, etc). I cannot even stand up without feeling like I’m going to faint or vomit. 

I ask the bride what she wants me to do - does she want me to risk vomiting all throughout the ceremony, does she want me to sit it out, etc. she just looks at me and shrugs. She has no input or compassion to provide. She says, “are you suggesting to miss the ceremony? Bc if that’s the case then like no. I need you. I can’t handle losing a bridesmaid right now. I need you in these photos so that years down the line I can like show my kids.” 

Realizing I am getting zero empathy from this human, I go into decision making mode and tell her I will meet her at the hotel later and that I’ll need to just get ready at the AirBnb. She says she’s fine with that. 

I get to the hotel, she doesn’t say a word to me. I last all afternoon in absolutely misery - sick, chills, fever, weakness, vomiting still. She’s totally engulfed in how beautiful everyone is. Doesn’t say a word about me. 5p, ceremony time comes. We take photos. Do the ceremony. I almost pass out. My friends in the audience are keeping a close eye on me bc they said I was transparent white and looked like I was going to keel over. I make it to photos after. I make it to the reception @ 7p. Around 9p I feel it’s time to go. I go to say goodbye to the bride. She doesn’t even move an inch, she just leans her shoulder toward me and says, “bye”.

This whole experience has shed light on the kind of individual she is. 100% selfish without any ability to see outside her narrow tunnel vision. IDGAF if it was “her day” - someone is physically ill and you make them endure something that makes them feel trapped? That is totally unkind and torturous.

I come back about 5 hours later and see that there are two large exfinity trucks blocking my driveway and  my backyard gate is wide open. This wouldn't really be an issue if I didn't also have five dogs that would either A: bolt and disappear or B: attack an intruder. Luckily my dogs were inside at this point and I'm so glad my sister hadn't let them out, but the whole ""what if"" still stands.
I walked through my gate into the garden, through yet another gate they had to open in order to get past the garden and into the rest of my yard, and find them with wires in their hands just looking at me. 
I yell ""excuse me, who the hell are you and why the hell are you in my yard? Do you have permission from me or anyone else to be here?""
To which one of the men says ""no one answered the door so we just let ourselves in.""
I said ""no, you don't fuckin do that."" And proceed to explain about my dogs and if they got out or got attacked, it'd be on them, and that this is my property.
He starts to get attitudey, saying ""this may be your property, but what I'm doing isn't your property."" And that if he needs in my backyard he's gonna do whatever he needs to to get in.
I told him he needs to leave and that he can come back to do his job when my parents get home the next day. He didn't like that answer so he said he's calling the police and I said ""please do""
Cops come and I talk to them calmly and tell them why it was concerning and why he didn't need to do that. They made him apologize and I decided that once my dogs went out to potty and come back in, then they may go do their work.

AITA for confronting them about this? I know it's their job, but he was rude and didn't want to acknowledge that this is still my property and stuff

Edit: I yelled because I was at a distance. I did call the owners (parents) and they told me to lock them in, to which I said no wtf.

c1xvdf	2019-06-18 04:43:03		AITA for not wanting my friend to be co founder of a club that was my idea?	"I’m not going to get too in detail because I know she’s on reddit and I’d hate for her to see this. 

We’re both in high school and it’s that time in our high school career where we’ve got to crack down and get our ECs in order for college apps. I’ve always loved writing, so I came up with the idea to start a creative writing club. She heard about it and wanted in. Originally, I offered her the spot of VP because, you know, it was my club, but she’s now switched to asking to be my co-founder/co-president instead. 

I know this sounds really petty, but I’d much prefer to be considered the sole founder because I was the person who came up with it. While she’s a total sweetheart, she’s not what I’d consider to be “on top” of it or organized in the slightest. She’s a super fun friend, but she also doesn’t really have a work ethic. I’m frustrated at the idea that I’d have to change my position on apps to co-founder, which kind of contradicts the sort of profile I’m trying to communicate across my apps: that I’m very independent and don’t need to rely on others to get things done (kind of ironic considering I’m writing this post tho...shhh). 

I guess it’s probably not going to make or break my chances of acceptance to the highly selective schools I’m shooting for, but I guess above everything else I just feel a little slighted. She hasn’t done a lick of work to get this club going and I’ve had to do all the paperwork/set up everything with an adult advisor while she gets to sit back with the cushy title of co founder and watch me make everything happen.  I also have a very clear vision of how this club should function, and I’d be a little disappointed if she suddenly got to start calling all the shots or overriding my opinion of the club I came up with. 

AITA? My parents told me to just give her the position and that I was being a little too selfish, so I’ve been considering biting my tongue and just letting her stay in the spot, but I wanted input from others."	No A-holes here	1	0

This is because of a trauma I got when I was mauled by a doberman when I was about 9 or 10. So, if I see a running dog towards me, expect me to fly off to the other side of the planet.

Today, I had to do an errand for the brunch cafe I was working at. I had to buy bone scraps from a local butcher to use for our beef broth. The moment I stepped out of the butcher's place, I saw two puppies running towards me. Like any other people who are afraid of dogs, I ran for my life. However, I got cornered in a dead end alley and got nowhere to run anymore. While panicking, I lost all my shit and began screaming for help while bawling my eyes out. And when the two puppies appeared again, I did what no sane person would do. I flailed and kicked to scare off the puppies. But they just continued barking at me. Then the unexpected happened. I accidentally kicked one of the puppies. Then the owner of the two puppies found us and calmed down the other puppy. He went to a nearby animal hospital and I followed him to see if the puppy is okay and if not might as well talk to him if ever he chooses to sue me.

Sadly, the puppy died. The owner began to ""lecture"" and flat out screamed at me saying, ""I will sue you!"". All I can do is say, ""But i was afraid and they were about to kill me."" in between sobs. I turns out that the dog was a service dog in training. So, guys, aita?"		1	0

I have been best friends with this girl for around 3-4 years. We began to get along after my other best friend moved away, and after that we became extremely close. She always invited me to hang out at her place, and we talked about pretty much everything. However, I always had a feeling that she wasn't a great person. She criticized me a lot for everything, from my poor handwriting to my lack of exercise. I thought that she was just giving constructive criticism, but a lot of times she would just make me feel stupid for not doing things the way she likes to do them. I have to say I never really told her how her comments could hurt me, so this could be a lack of communication. Nevertheless, we kept being friends, until a few months ago I realized she can be pretty fake. She talks crap about pretty much everyone, but she tries to manipulate people into thinking she is actually nice. She also has admitted that she enjoys manipulating others, and I have come to realize she has even manipulated me into doing things for her. Now, the reason I am posting this is because of how I handled the situation. After realizing all of this, I began to keep my distance. I tried to avoid talking to her (pretty hard to do, considering we share most of our classes and have the same friend group), and just talked to other people. I never gave her an explanation for any of this, but she tried to talk to me about it. She said she was sick of how I had made my boyfriend my priority and stopped  hanging out with her because of that. I didn't tell her the truth (that I think she's a toxic friend); I just said I was busy with other stuff, not just my boyfriend. I tried hanging out with her again, but she honestly makes me uncomfortable. So, I kept on trying to avoid her, and she has since then sort of taken the hint. I guess i forced us to grow apart. Still, I wonder if what I did was actually really shitty. Most of my friends don't really like her either, so I don't feel like their judgement would be fair. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I would buy snacks, eat a portion of it (most of the time maybe 1/6) and pour the rest in a Tupperware container (air tight), leaving it in the house pantry. 


Yes, I leave it in the house pantry for all to share. BUT my Grandfather would finish it all WITHIN 3 DAYS OF ME LEAVING IT THERE.


Everytime I confront him about it, he would say  “I always see food there, and no one ever eats it, so I just eat it.” (Translated from chinese, so it’s a little off.)


I’m a student, that needs to go to school, so clearly i don’t have enough time to eat what I bought, thus the air tight container. But I bought it, and of course I’d want more of it. Just because it tastes good and you see it sitting there, doesn’t mean he had to finish it and not leave any for the rest of the family to share.


My parents and siblings would have the same happen to them, express their obvious dissatisfaction of what he does, and shit like this just continues.


I hate it even more when we bring snacks back from foreign countries that aren’t available locally, and he just CHOMPS DOWN on it.


Especially recently, I just came back from a  holiday and fell sick. He finished HALF THE SNACKS I BROUGHT BACK within 5 days without even telling me.

The standard way that these businesses work is that I get given a list of students. I get their paperwork, and their contact info and I go ahead and schedule them into my day.

At the end of the week (Or 15th and end of each month) I submit invoices for the lessons I did, and the companies pay me.

This has worked awesome for the last 2 years.

Now one of the companies (the one I enjoy working for the most) is changing their system. This is a company where the only two in-car instructors are myself and the owner (who is easing into retirement)

I will be paid a lump sum when I begin with a student, which I am A-OK with.

But all scheduling is to be done through the office. As in the students will contact the office, the office will tell them my availability (based on what I told the office) and the students don't contact me directly until I show up for their lesson.

I sent an email to the office explaining that I am concerned it will hurt my flexibility in scheduling these students, and that I would prefer staying with the old method.

We have gone back and forth a few times about them saying it is what is happening and me saying I don't like it. So far they have essentially told me that they are doing it anyways.

c1xown	2019-06-18 04:22:48	AbleButterscotch9	WIBTA for cancelling my HBO subscription?	"So me and my buddy have been living together for a couple years now, and in that time, I had gotten him into a good amount of HBO's catalog. I was able to do this because I was using my parent's HBO account, but a couple months ago, they told me they were going to cancel. Not wanting to miss the final season of Game of Thrones, I decided to bite the bullet and get my own subscription to the service, and since the season ended, I explored a good amount of their content. The problem is that I'm a broke 20-something. Money is tight, and I like to conserve wherever I can, so I'm currently on the fence about whether I want to keep it.

My buddy has plans to move in with his girlfriend at the end of the month. Last night, while we were hanging out, he asked me if I was planning on keeping HBO, and I told him I wasn't sure. His response was ""If you cancel HBO, we'll take back our Hulu."" 

I don't appreciate being given ultimatums. I don't appreciate being manipulated. He's not even paying for the Hulu account, his girlfriend is. If they're planning on keeping their Hulu going anyway, then letting me use it costs them nothing, whereas I don't want to throw away $20 a month for something I don't use. His attitude just strikes me as petty and childish, and frankly I'm now leaning toward cancelling my HBO out of spite. Then again, perhaps I'm being the childish and petty one.

c1xmpn	2019-06-18 04:16:02		AITA for not letting my parents who traveled 500 miles use my phone to watch movies?	I’m 20 and going to college 500 miles away from my home town. I’m paying for college by myself and I’ve moved in and out 500 miles by myself three or four times. My dad recently got a raise so they decided to come up and help me move out, and turn it into a week long vacation in a nearby town. The Airbnb we’re in has a projector that plugs into you’re iPhone to watch movies on. They both have androids and I’m the only one with an iPhone. They asked to borrow my phone and when I said no they threw a whole fit about it. I bought my phone by myself and it has my own private information on it. They got super butthurt about it and started trying to guilt trip me on the fact that this trip cost them about $5k. They said they spent all this money “on me” and that I could show some gratitude by letting them borrow my phone so they can get the full experience of the Airbnb. I told them that while I appreciate that they’re here, I didn’t ask them to turn it into a huge expensive vacation. Am I the asshole for not letting them borrow my phone to watch a movie on?

My wife and I were travelling with our two kids Jill [17F] and Bob [14M]. On our last full day we had a bit of a disagreement. My wife and Jill wanted to see Place A, while Bob and I wanted to go to Place B. None of us had any interest in the others' destination. And doing both was unrealistic. I suggested what I thought was the logical solution: mom would take Jill to Place A, I would bring Bob to Place B, and we'd meet back at the hotel room before dinner. I thought that would make everyone happy.

But my wife disagreed. She said a family vacation is about being together and we needed to compromise. Her solution was spending the day at Place A and allowing me/Bob to choose where we ate dinner. I thought that was unfair. We argued for a few minutes, until I realized I was getting nowhere and I reluctantly agreed. It seemed to ruin the mood for the rest of the day.

I talked to some friends after returning. Surprisingly they agreed with her about what a family vacation should be. Now I'm conflicted. Was I the asshole?"		1	0
c1xlca	2019-06-18 04:11:44		AITA for not wanting someone to travel with us ?	"Hey, a little back story and I hope I word this correctly. So, a few weeks ago a friend that I've met through a mutual ''friend'' decided to take a little trip to Jamaica. The guy I want to go on a trip with has been going through some shit and is trying to change his lifestyle and other ""friend'' hasn't really been supportive and has been selectively hanging out with others whom are in our group, that he too is friends with and leaving him out- plus rubbing in the fact that's he's has got such a big social circle. Anyways, I hate seeing people being left out because they can cramp your style sort of BS. I get him involved in the boxing gym and getting him out to the beach and other activities etc. We develop a friendship and shit.

We all have a group chat that we are a part of, and so me and my buddy have been messaging back and forth about the trip everyone in the group wanted to go on initially. We made the decision to say in the chat that we are going because we obviously like everyone in the group (I personally am not a fan of other ""friend"") so we thought that having a few more people could cancel out the fact that other ""friend"" is there. Later on in the group chat everyone says they can't go due to timing and finances and this includes other ""friend'' as well. Buddy says in the chat he can go, then I mention I have that time off and that I too can go.

Then all of a sudden other ""friend"" comes out and says he can come.....

I message my buddy and ask him why the sudden change ?! So, yeah let's skip a couple weeks later and Buddy and I are planning what to do and places to see etc. Nothing is booked because other ""friend"" says he will confirm once he gets the time approved, so we wait....

We had to message the group chat asking him if he got the time off. A week later he got it approved and all the airline tickets are sold out. I was fuming, we had to wait to book things for the guy who invites himself and who is extremely indecisive! My buddy gets a message from him saying he wants to go to Florida and visit the Keys, I immediately get to chatting to the guy and flat out say no. We live on a small Island and it's bigger than the Keys actually. I went ahead and booked my ticket for a later date and my buddy let other ""friend"" know and asked if he can make those dates. Later on he says to have a good time and he is disappointed.... WTF! We originally had plans to do Jamaica and thought it was going to just be us two, then out of no where ""friend"" can join as soon as we say we can go. I went ahead and booked my ticket because I missed a golden opportunity the first time because of ""friend"""		1	0

2. I've learned she was involved with a married guy with kids. She would bad-mouth the wife, but at the same time she would tell me this was her ""rock-bottom"".
3. I would be so drained everytime I talk to her. It is all about her drama, and all the guys she dated.

c1xk4e	2019-06-18 04:08:08	Suspicious_Football	AITA for not wanting to attend best friend's bachelorette party and pre-wedding parties?	"My best friend since childhood decided to throw her wedding activities the weekend I'm visiting our hometown in two weeks. I know this is special for her and she wants to make it convenient for me.

&#x200B;

I'm only there for a few days and was very excited to see family members and close old friends (they are not part of these wedding activities). I was also bringing my new boyfriend to meet my parents. We've been together for a year but friends through college, and our schedules have never worked out for a trip back home since we've started dating. He's already met most of my old friends. 

&#x200B;

My BFF's longtime boyfriend recently proposed and they decided they are doing a quick wedding in late summer (which I'm going to). Her new pre-wedding plans while I'm visiting consist of: 

* A party at her fiance's family's house about two hours away from my hometown. The home is on a beach and I've been there before. This would be a two hour car ride each way for my boyfriend and I. This night conflicts with when I was hoping to see my parents.
* A bachelorette party that is about an hour away from my hometown and the plan is to hit up nightclubs (I don't enjoy drinking and hate loud clubs). Since my boyfriend doesn't have friends or family nearby, he will be on his own that evening and night. This night conflicts with the night I had already made plans with another group of friends from college. 
* Brunch with the girls who are attending the bachelorette party and possibly shopping for some wedding jewelry/shoes. I honestly don't want to do this. 

&#x200B;

Oddly, I feel obligated. My budget did not originally include to extend the trip to be able to do all of the things I wanted to do plus these wedding events. I'm considering uninviting my boyfriend on this trip to save him the hassle. We got the refundable tickets.

c1xjip	2019-06-18 04:06:07		AITA for purposefully being creepy to someone online?	"throwaway account since bf knows my reddit

I've been on Grindr looking for people to chat with and possibly find an alternative to my bf since we hit a rough patch (lining up possible romances before calling it off), and found this user.

As far as grindr accounts go, his is pretty standard. Shirtless pic, faceless pic, no name, looking for chat. Well, same, I'm okay chatting, but he doesn't bite. I send a pic to show I'm not a bot, but nothing. I give him a few hours, but he doesn't reply. Now I'm thinking this poor kid (18 yo) doesn't really understand that he'll continue to get persistent creeps unless he learns to block them or shoo them away, so I send him a message:

""Hey, if you're not interested, it's best to say no or block. So I don't keep messaging you :)""

Nothing happens. I feel this kid is putting himself in an awkward position and I feel that I'm in a bad spot. then he sends a message, it's a pic of himself, but no text or anything. It's been a day and I've just been sending a message every few hours like ""cute pic, want to chat?"" ""hey, we're near each other, let's meet"" ""my boyfriend likes pokemon too""

and I feel I'm too creepy, but also thinking I should continue so I can ask him to block or just say no?

I mean why doesn't he just assert himself more?!

AITA? Also I drank a bit so I can be more truthful with this post, so I'm more... expressive"		1	0

c1xicm	2019-06-18 04:02:40	thisisnotmymain9876	WIBTA if I tell my friends oblivious girlfriend about him being an asshole.	"My friend really only cares about his reputation and what others think of him, is somewhat selfish, and doesn’t really care much for his girlfriend. They’re relationship is mostly her caring and putting in effort while he doesn’t do much or care about her. 

He started liking her because she was hot (which suggests that he is mainly in it for the sexual aspect of the relationship) and this is definitely true because he has told me multiple times that he finds that more important than the other parts of their relationship. He also was mainly the one giving in their sex lives and he got upset when she wouldn’t reciprocate.. he was upset and annoyed when she wouldn’t give him a blowjob when she was obviously not ready to and that just shows that he cares more about himself receiving sexual pleasure than caring about whether or not his girlfriend is ready to do this which is unhealthy.

His girlfriend loves him a lot and is blinded by this.. she doesn’t realize that he is basically using her for the sex and the feeling of being in a relationship while also boosting his reputation. I feel like she should know that he is doing this to her because it is unfair that she is being taken advantage of like this and doesn’t realize that he’s being an asshole due to her being blinded by love. 

He has also kept some information from her before about their relationship.. he had wanted to break up with her for a while (since April) but hasn’t done it because it would ruin his reputation and he also wants to keep her around for the sexual aspect. I feel like if he doesn’t tell her it will just make things worse for her when she finds out he wants to and had wanted to break up with her for a long time, and think she deserves to know the truth.

I feel like it isn’t my place to tell her this but also am conflicted because what he is doing to her isn’t right at all. 

So, WIBTA if I told her what is going on and who he really is because she can’t see through him?

Edit: We have tried to contact him to confront him about this and he hasn’t responded.. plus we have told him multiple times to tell her and he hasn’t done anything about it. He isn’t confrontational at all. Also he is gone for the summer and wouldn’t be able to tell her in person and has little to no cell reception."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c1xhpo	2019-06-18 04:00:46	etoileleciel1	AITA for inviting a friend to spend a few weeks with me?	"Sorry if this is kind of me rambling. I'm not that great at telling stories, especially through messaging. 

So, I am currently living in an apartment with two other girls. We all kind of keep to ourselves and have our own ""rooms"". I put quotes around room because I technically live in the living room and it was kind of converted into a bedroom by putting curtains on the entrance and the kitchen area. None the less, I'm not too upset about it because I'm just glad that I don't have to share a room. One of my roommates is a grad student, the other is working, and I recently got my undergraduate degree and on the job hunt. I have a friend who has also recently graduated from the same school and she has to move out of her place pretty soon. I told her that she could stay with me for a couple of weeks, since she's accepted a job in another country and will be moving there early July. I'm currently subleasing from a girl who used to live in this room.

I told all of my roommates and the girl I'm subleasing from that I will be having her over for a few weeks. The girl I'm subleasing from said that she was completely okay with me having my friend over for a few weeks. She literally told me that ""it's your room girl. you can have whoever you want."" The only person who seems to have an issue with it is the working roommate. The working roommate, who we'll call Saumya, is the only person giving me trouble with having my friend her more than 3 days.

The grad student roommate, who we'll call Hamia, hasn't responded, but I'm 99% sure that she'll be fine with it. Her boyfriend has recently visited from France and Saumya told her that her boyfriend could only stay with us for 3 days. (Imagine telling someone that their significant other could only stay for 3 days after them flying out from another country.) Because of Saumya's policy, Hamia was and still is sneaking her boyfriend in and out of our apartment when Saumya is in her room. I have been covering for Hamia and her boyfriend for at lease two weeks.

Since I recently told both roommates that my friend with be staying over, Saumya wants to put the same policy. I pay my rent on time to my subleaser, pay the utilities to Saumya, I don't make a mess, I do my end of the chores, & I keep to myself. We don't get inspections from the leasing office/complex company since this is an area where lots of college students rent the rooms and there's usually 5-7 people living in a two bedroom/one bathroom apartment (the rent is really expensive). 

AITA?


TL;DR:  One of my roommates won't allow me to have a friend over for more than 2-3 days. I don't pay rent to her, just utilities. Everyone else seems to be fine with me having my friend over. AITA?

ETA: So, I discussed it with Hamia and I asked the leasing office about their policies on guests. They didn’t say anything about a policy for guests staying over for more than 2-3 days. We also learned that Saumya may be over charging us for our rent. We asked what the price for the apartment would be and since there’s 3 of us in a 2 bedroom/1 bathroom and with the math, it seems like we’re paying part of her rent."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
