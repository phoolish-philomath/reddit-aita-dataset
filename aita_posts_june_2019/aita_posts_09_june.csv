byt725	2019-06-10 03:58:35	InternetIntroverts	WIBTA if I traveled back home to where my mother was buried after my father banned me from ever visiting?	"So I am NC with a lot of my family members. This all started at the beginning of this year when my husband and I took in my best friends two children after she passed away from cancer. We eventually adopted them and finished that around a month ago.

They were extremely cruel and cold and very harsh. I’ve talked about this before on my profile a few times if anyone wants more information. My mother ended up having a heart attack and passed away from cardiac arrest. My father immediately blamed me and said it was all my fault. I was kicked out of the family and was not allowed to attend her funeral or know where she was buried. 

The only person I have remained close to is my 17 year old sister. My other younger sibling has not reached out. My sister and I talk on a burned phone because I know the consequences would be very severe for her if our father found out.

She told me that she found out the address and wanted to let me know because I never had a chance to say goodbye or my peace to her. It’s not close to me but I’m tempted to travel back for one day and just have a moment with her and just say everything I wish I could have said. 

My father made it very clear that I was no longer welcome in the family or to ever try and figure out where she was hurried. WIBTA if I did it anyways and told no one in my family? I think the closure would be nice but if it makes me an asshole then it’s probably not worth it. My therapist says closure would be good so WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	8982.0	1279.0	0.0	0.0
byt6lz	2019-06-10 03:57:08	perturbedparenthood	AITA about being pissed at how my ex watches my kid?	"Throwaway cause my ex knows my main.

My ex and I broke up because she had an affair.
We still live together for the time being but for various unrelated reasons, I legally have full custody of my baby.

I recently started at a new job, the first I've worked since I gave birth a couple months ago. My ex has been watching my kid while I work. I just found out from my mother, who was over helping out, that my ex hardly takes care of her while I'm at work. 

She apparently just feeds her and lays her down so she can watch anime. She doesnt do any of the developmental activities or make sure she stays up at all. Just lays her down in her crib all day.

I get off work in the evening and immediately have to take over because she gets an attitude about how ""the baby just screams for at least an hour every time you leave"" and how its apparently so hard. So I take care of her all night too. 

She doesnt wash bottles, she doesnt bathe the baby, she doesn't do anything with her beyond feeding her and setting her down and maybe changing her a couple times. 

I had already expected that she wasnt doing what was needed. I would come home to no clean bottles. The baby clearly hungry. Would be crying until I took her. 

So I'm pissed, and I chewed my ex out over this and told her if she expects to be a parent she has to act like one and not like a shitty babysitter, and she spit back that I made the three month old baby too dependant on me (because I'm the primary caretaker) and that she deserves to be able to relax too and I cant judge how she takes care of the baby and that I'm a dick for yelling at her.

I dont feel like I am an asshole. But I just wanted to make sure, because if I'm in the wrong I'll suck it up and apologise."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byt50l	2019-06-10 03:52:04	assh0lle21334	AITA for not wanting my girlfriend’s daughter falling asleep with us	"I moved in with my girlfriend about 2 months ago. She has a 2.5 year old daughter. Please spare me the “you shouldn’t have moved in with someone with a kid”. My girlfriend and I made our decision based on what we thought was best for us at the time. Everything really has been fine other than this

I made it VERY clear before I moved in the if we were to live together, her daughter could not be sleeping in the same bed as us. I have sleep apnea, and my sleep is very important as I have a fast paced job I need to be on top of things for. 

I told her if this is something that she didn’t want to do, PLEASE DONT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO FOR ME. The last thing I want is for her to feel like I’m getting in between the relationship of her and her daughter. I would more than happily find my own place but she insisted she would make the transition. Cool. 

Recently she has been putting her to sleep in our bed then taking her into her room instead of laying with her in her room. It’s more comfortable and they go to bed a bit earlier than I do when she has her. No big deal but a bit annoying as I have to wake my gf up to
Move her kid, to which she’ll usually fall back asleep while I’m brushing my teeth then I’ll have to wait again. 

But tonight she had been coughing a bit all day and I wanted to get to bed a bit earlier because I had to be up earlier than usual. I just politely asked my gf if she could put her to sleep in her room because every time she coughs, I wake up. She has brought her in our bed at 3-4am in the past (against our agreement, because she doesn’t want to lay in there) and I was woken up every 15 minutes by her coughing. 

She got mad saying “it must be nice not having to worry about anyone but yourself. God forbid your sleep gets interrupted one night” and just totally went off after a calm request. Yes I get it, she’s her daughter. I respect that 100%. But we made an agreement and that’s why I’m frustrated here. I’m sitting awake right now because they’re in our bed. Am I an asshole for just not wanting her daughter to be in our bed during the hours we would be asleep?

Edit: her daughter will only fall asleep with her mom by her side at home. I have tried! I wouldn’t have moved in with her or even be in a relationship if I didn’t very much care for her daughter. She loves playing with me and we’ll have a great time but she is very clingy to her mom at bedtime when she’s tired."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

byt3vg	2019-06-10 03:48:37	SauronOMordor	AITA for telling my coworker I don't give a shit about her kid?	"I love my workplace and one of the main reasons is because everyone is chill and nice and easy to get along with. I always ask my co-workers what's going on and how their weekend was, etc. and for the most part I am actually interested in what they've got going on. 

My husband and I don't have or want kids, but we have nieces and nephews and friends with kids and we genuinely love the little fuckers. I do ask most of my coworkers with kids about them now and then and if one of them has a funny or cute story about one of them I eat it up. All this to establish that although I'm childfree, I am by no means a hater of children. I just don't find them to be the most interesting and fascinating topics of conversation most of the time. 

One co-worker, unfortunately, seems to have built her entire personality around being a mom and it is fucking OBNOXIOUS. Literally no matter what you're talking about, she somehow manages to turn it into another story about her boring ass kid who honest to goodness none of the stories are ever even remotely entertaining about. 

Even more unfortunately, she sits right by me in our open concept office. 

I'd basically already gotten to the point where I don't ask her how her weekend was or what's new or anything else since I already know it'll just be another 20 minute tale about her kid doing absolutely nothing worth hearing about. 

On Friday she somehow managed to squeeze a story about her kid trying on shoes (spoiler alert: it was literally just them going to the store and spending an hour picking out and trying on different shoes and then they got slurpees) and I just sort of had enough and when she finally finished her story I just deadeyed looked at her and said ""you know I don't give a shit about any of that right?"" 

She was pretty taken aback and didn't really know what to say. Finally she just said ""um.. ok... That's rude."" 

I probably should have just left it but I decided to tell her ""look, I get that your kid is the most interesting person in the world to you, but he isn't to me and I'm sick of hearing about every little thing he does. I don't care."" 

She was clearly pissed and just turned back to her own stuff and didn't talk or even look at me the rest of the day. 

I'm pretty sure Monday morning is gonna be awkward AF but I'm not sure whether I should apologize or not because I genuinely don't want to give the impression that I didn't mean what I said - I really, truly am sick of hearing about her kid all day every day - but I also want to smooth things over so it's not just s big ball of tension all day for god knows how long... 

Am I the asshole for saying what I said? And WIBTA if I don't apologize?

Edit: I should have been clearer in my OP that it's not just that she talks incessantly about her kid and none of the stories are remotely interesting, but that she interrupts whatever anyone else is talking about to insert a story about her kid and makes ever single conversation about him one way or another. It is literally impossible to talk to her about *anything* else."	Asshole	0	0	5399.0	328.0	0.0	0.0
byt3jh	2019-06-10 03:47:32	Zesidia	AITA if I don't give my daughter a Chinese name	"Let's start by explaining that I am American and my husband is Chinese. His parents still live in China and do not speak English. I don't really like them, even before the situation with our children, and that may be why I'm so against the Chinese name thing. I'm looking for some outside perspective.

 January 2018 I gave birth to our first child, a daughter, but she will stillborn at 39 weeks (umbilical cord wrapped around her neck). This absolutely destroyed me and is something I am still working to come to terms with. My husband's parents looked at one picture of her and that was it. My father-in-law thought his coworkers words were so comforting he would share with me a few days after, ""maybe you lost her so you could have a grandson."" This pissed me off to no end, but what hurts the most is that they never asked her name. They do not want to know their first grandchild's name. My husband said it is because it makes them sad so they don't want to think about it. She is never mentioned or acknowledged.

Now on Valentine's day of this year we were able to welcome our little rainbow, also a little girl. My in-laws love her and are absolutely thrilled when they video chat with her. Recently my husband has mentioned giving her a Chinese name so his parents have something they can call her because they don't speak English. I don't want to give her a Chinese name because they are not willing to put in the effort to learn her English name or the Chinese equivalent. I especially don't want to let them name her since they have so casually blown off her sister. 

The way I see it, I was only able to give my first daughter her name. It is all she has from us and the only way for others to remember her. They didn't want to give her a Chinese name so why would I let them give her little sister one. I know it may sound petty, but honestly really upsets me that they have never once asked about our first daughter's name.

So AITA?

Edit: I appreciate the input, except for the remarks that I'm somehow racist - completely out of line - and it has really given me a lot to think about. I never want my 2nd to feel she is less than my 1st and would never want to do anything to harm her. I think I will sit down with my husband and we come up with a Chinese name for her. My issues with her grandparents are my own and shouldn't be pushed onto her. Though I think they grieve in their own way, I think it is not outrageous for me to expect that they know our first daughter's name. I understand there are cultural differences, but I feel that does go both ways so they could be more understanding of me as well. I will work on things and pay more attention to how my actions may impact my living child. It never occurred to me that SHE may be impacted and that is the biggest asshole move. I'm not 100% sure how we will go about this, but I now see how I was being selfish."	Not the A-hole	0	0	17.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My family and I aren’t really all that close, granted, I call them once in a while to ask them how they’re doing but we never really talked like how other people talk to their families.

She met my best friend on vacation to NYC and they eventually got married. I even officiated their wedding myself. She is a great person, a very hard worker and a joy to be around. Today on Facebook she posted a meme about how all of North and South America is America and the United States of America is just the United States. She went on in the comments about how we are All Americans and if you’re from the United States you are simply a United States citizen. 

I did my best to comment politely that in this country we call ourselves Americans as part of our National Identity. I pointed out as an international traveler she is familiar with etiquette and customs and the desire to avoid being rude to people and their culture. And that this subject in particular, Implying that it is incorrect for US citizens to call themselves Americans, is considered rude (yes I elected myself representative of all Americans.) Now I am a very liberal and open minded person, so I am perfectly willing to understand that in South America people call themselves Americans despite the fact that maybe they are Brazilian or Columbia or Guatemalan (Central American.) 

But Hey, I’m an American. I’ve Always called myself an American. And I fly an American flag on my home despite the fact that this implies I support ultra nationalism which I do not. But seriously. I was offended. For the first time in a long time. I finally got offended. 

So my best friend posts one of those Facebook crying faces on my “national identity” comment and she responds with my name and the word “Wow.” I suppose to show how small minded I am. Look I’m willing to hear both sides of the argument but I feel walked all over after certifying the contract she used to get her citizenship and then feel like Somehow I’m a bigot because I support the word American to mean person, place or thing from the United States of America.

 Fast forward and they have their first child. (They have three now.) The children are awesome and I love them to death.
 B treats them terribly, (not abusive) and has turned my uncle into a completely different person. My uncle is now strict and snaps at the littlest things.
 
 This week we were on vacation and Uncle and B wanted to go out by themselves. They asked me to watch their kids while they were gone. I declined. They called me a brat, rude, ugly, and a few other mean names. They never say these things to my face though. I had to hear about this from my mother.

"For context, I'm a sixteen year old girl (actually turning seventeen during the three weeks I'll be gone), and during the summer I'm going to an Economics class at a university for three weeks, to hopefully help inform my college decisions.

&#x200B;

My uncle, my mom's brother, in his late forties, has been through some tough times recently. He moved across the country to help his ex-girlfriend who was dying of brain cancer, leaving his job at a gas station behind. He's not a stranger; I've seen him at family gatherings and such, and had a few outings with him-once we went to Chicago with just me, him, and my mom. Due to all his past trouble he's rough around the edges, but a kind soul, I believe.

&#x200B;

Apparently he got back together with said ex-girlfriend, who ended up being really abusive, and called the cops on him once. Turns out she didn't ever have cancer and was manipulating him.

&#x200B;

He decided to stay in this new state, got a job at a factory and eventually a car. However, he then ended up getting a DUI, as he always had some alcoholism troubles. He got his car taken away, and he may or may not have been homeless during this time.

&#x200B;

Anyway, after all that shit, he got hit by a car just a week or two ago. He's not fatally injured, but his knee, etc. is messed up. He's moving back near here to live with my grandparents, his parents, for the time being.

&#x200B;

However, my grandma is pretty anxious and neurotic, and is already dealing with my grandpa, who is older and has heart issues and could basically die at any second. Therefore, my dad thinks that it'll be too much for her to deal with her husband and her son, basically taking care of both of them. So, he asked if my uncle could live in my room for three weeks while I'm gone, to give my grandma a break.

&#x200B;

I have an extra bed in my room (it's not a huge room, the beds take up about half of it), so its not like he'd be in my bed. I'd obviously have to clean up everything a TON, including my connecting bathroom which only I use.

&#x200B;

I also do get pretty severe anxiety myself, usually health anxiety, but sometimes about my stuff being moved and touched. I haven't properly cleaned my room in years because I get overwhelmed, and the thought of a guy using my shower freaks me out a bit. Which I know is stupid, but still. Also just the thought of a guy in my room when I'm not there, is kinda unsettling. I know he's family and wouldn't touch anything...But I wouldn't even be there to supervise.

&#x200B;

When my dad mentioned it to me a few days ago, I told him uncomfortably that I'd have to think about it. As far as I know, it's all my dad's idea. It seemed to me, to be reasonable to want some time to think on it, but he seemed disappointed and told me that he ""rather hoped I'd say yes straightaway to helping a family member"". 

&#x200B;

Like I said, I'm not sure. I really don't feel comfortable with it, but I know I'm uncomfortable with a lot of normal things, and it might be worth it for family."	Asshole	0	0	1924.0	205.0	0.0	0.0

&#x200B;

So I recently graduated college this past Wednesday. I flew back to school on Tuesday (because I go to school out of state) with my dad. I knew my mom was flying in as well but was unsure whether my cousin (on my mom’s side) would be coming, as most communication goes through my mom and I’m not very close with her. On my graduation day, my mom tells me that my cousin (who lives in a different state) couldn’t make it because of a work thing. Later I find out that she was in my hometown since Sunday (remember I didn’t leave until Tuesday) and neither of them told me. I flew back home the next day after grad and I don’t hear from my cousin until Friday, two days after I graduate. That’s when she decides to call (I didn’t pick up) and then text saying she’s sorry she couldn’t make it and that she’s in town for work, has been super busy, and wasn’t able to call and that she would like to meet before she leaves the same day. I don’t respond. 

I’m upset at the fact that 1. She’s in my hometown and doesn’t tell me 2. She couldn’t even call/text the day of or even before saying congratulations (keep in mind that this is one of the biggest days of my life) 3. She decides to tell me **the day she’s leaving** that she’s in town and wants to meet, making me feel like an afterthought

I wasn’t expecting this, got very nervous and spat out my answer, and then felt so embarrassed and bad about myself for the rest of the night.

Not only is my scar a source of a lot of self-esteem and emotional issues, but I also have always thought that it was generally impolite to point out flaws/imperfections in people’s bodies like that. It’s one thing to talk about if I bring it up or if we’re really close friends or even if it was in private or something - but I was pretty upset that something that I’m deeply insecure about had attention drawn to it in front of a bunch of people. The way I see it...it’s my body, and I feel like it’s rude to make inquiries about someone else’s body because your body is more important than someone else’s curiosity. I feel like it’s the same as asking an overweight person why they’re overweight or asking someone with a disfigurement why they’re disfigured. It just seems to be in poor taste to me, but maybe I’m wrong???

My boyfriend and I have been dating for nearly 3 years but we both live with our parents. Because I have strict parents, my family is unaware of his existence in my life but his are fully aware of mine and do welcome me into their lives, for which I am very grateful.

Recently we had spent the day out together and it being late he offered for me to sleep over at his home. I have done so very rarely before, but I have always ensured that there was no other option left (i.e. another friend's place). I will admit I am very particular about potentially inconveniencing people with such requests, especially my boyfriend’s parents as I want them to have the best possible impression of me.

That being said, he was able to reassure me that it would not be an inconvenience at all, and I agreed to do so for the night. However, I was horrified to realize later that my period had snuck up on me, and I didn't have anything at hand to deal with that (i.e. pads, clothes, etc). I woke up in the morning to see a small stain on the sheets and was absolutely mortified; it had seeped through onto his mattress. I quickly got out of bed and went to clean the sheets, panicking and hyperventilating as this was probably one of my biggest social fears ever so I was not handling it well. My boyfriend did his absolute best to comfort me and keep it quiet as it was fairly early in the morning, and the last thing I wanted was to wake up his parents. He even took me to the nearest store to get a fresh pair of clothes and sanitary pads as soon as I was done cleaning the stain off his sheets.

While we were out, I made a clear-cut promise that I would never ever sleep over again (which I plan on sticking to) so as to prevent something like this from happening and inconveniencing not only him but potentially his mom who'd be the one doing laundry. He was very hurt and claimed that I was overreacting and not thinking rationally. I was making a ""mountain out of a molehill"" about something that is natural, and he was offended that I seemed to have very little faith in his family; it apparently came across as me being disrespectful due to how hung up I was on what his parents would think of me if they found out. The argument got a bit heated, and I admitted that in the past I had come close to clogging his home toilet and rather than ask for a plunger from his family, I cleaned and managed to clear up the toilet on my own simply to avoid my sheer mortification regarding the whole situation. He got upset at that as well and felt offended that I wouldn't rely on him and found it unreasonable that I would ""vow"" to never sleep over simply because of incidents like these.

Am I the asshole in this situation?

**EDIT:** To offer a little bit of background as to why this is a huge deal for me - I have been raised in a super conservative fashion and as a result have formed certain boundaries. Prior to this relationship, I pretty much never depended on anybody for anything if they were not my immediate family.  That being said, I did tell his mother afterwards that it happened and she took it well, but I could tell she thought that I should have been better prepared to avoid this incident, and I agree wholeheartedly. Additionally, periods are a SUPER sensitive and taboo topic of discussion in my culture and family, and when I am home the procedure is vastly different; I am typically in my own area of the house for a few days until it ends and I deal with my own sheets and garments accordingly. Sure it happens and it's perfectly natural, but I never want to put someone else in the position of having to deal with my messes, ergo my promise to my boyfriend."

However, I’ve been feeling bad because I didn’t get them a gift. At the time, I felt it was okay for a few reasons:

1. They’d stated on their wedding website that the presence of loved ones was all they wanted (but they also provided a registry, I mean who doesn’t like gifts). It was a super informal wedding, and they’re very chill people, so I believed it. 

2. The wedding was on the other side of the country, and so I and several of their friends had to fly out and get accommodations. We’re young broke artists (24 to 25), so this alone was nearly too much for me to afford. 

3. There were no gifts physically brought to the wedding; it seemed like all the gifts were given in advance via the registry. 

4. I contributed during the weekend and bought food, snacks, picked up supplies, etc. 

But I’ve been thinking that it’s still an unspoken thing that you’re supposed to give a gift to compensate for the meal, or something? I don’t really know, I’d never been to a wedding before. 

So AITA? Are gifts at a wedding non-negotiable? I don’t think that they minded either way, but I still feel bad.

Edit: thanks for the feedback everyone!! I feel a lot better about it now, it hadn’t occurred to me that officiating could be a sort of “gift” cuz I was so jazzed to get to do it haha."	Not the A-hole	0	0	293.0	15.0	0.0	0.0

S was my first friend at my new school, and as a result I’ve known her for a lot longer than this other girl, X. X is my best friend (though I’m only one of hers), pretty much my only friend, and I love hanging out with her.  X is also very good friends with S.

The trouble with S is that she’s recently started to ignore me. When I’m in a group with her, she’ll only talk to the others; she won’t look at me, and will basically pretend I’m not there. Because she won’t talk to me, I can’t really confront her. Through mutual friends I found out that she’s doing that because apparently I’m bad for her mental health - I’m over-competitive, constantly arguing, always trying to one up her. Which is funny, because that’s what she’s been doing to me. 

I had decided to just let S do her own thing, but I wanted to remain friends with X. So X invites me over to hang out, and I say yeah sure, but just before I actually leave to go over there, X tells me that S will be there too. I can’t back out, and I spend the night trying not to engage too much with S. Then S all but tells X something I didn’t want ANYONE to know, something I didn’t want S to find out, and something I expressly told her to keep secret: that I actually had sex with my now ex boyfriend, who is now dating S. I have a lot of regrets there, and would prefer to say that it didn’t happen. 

Eventually, I just decide to leave. Then X posts a whole set of photos of her and S being friends, dressing up together, all stuff that they’ve done since I left. In addition, the only class I share with X, I also share with S, and S makes an effort to sit between me and X every time. Altogether, it feels like S is trying to cut me off from my other friends. I’ve tried talking to X about S, but X wants to stay friends and be nice with S. I can’t really fault that, but I do know that I can’t handle S weaselling away all of her attention while cutting me off from her. 

So, reddit, WIBTA if I decide to stop being friends with X because she is still friends with S?

bysts2	2019-06-10 03:17:47	toodlescaboodles	AITA For pursuing my former coworkers ex?	"TLDR; I accepted a friend request from my former coworkers ex after she left work, and we’re almost definitely going to hook up. Is it wrong because I know she is insecure about his attraction to me?

Ok. Last year (July) at work (I’m a receptionist) this guy comes into the office and immediately catches my eye. He asks for my coworker, and I see that this is her bf/baby dad. I was still married at the time, so I wasn’t looking for anyone anyway. He was very familiar to me, though and I couldn’t place him. I’m not originally from the area, so I had no idea why he was so familiar. 

The next day coworker asked me if I went to school in (town near my hometown) and told me her bf thought I looked familiar, even stated maybe we had made out at a party as kids. Once she told me his family name I realized I probably knew some of his family, and while I’m not whoever he’d made out with, it was very likely we had run into each other at some point in the past. For the time, it was dropped and I went about leaving my husband in October. 

During that same time, coworker and her bf were also parting ways. I could see how torn up she was about it, and we commiserated about our situations. We didn’t become besties or anything, but we did bond. So when he friended me on fb, I told my coworker about it, and left the request hanging. She, of course, blew up at him about it, and once again we all let it drop.

Coworker left the office in March of this year. Husband and I officially decided on divorce versus possibly trying to work things out in April. Fb pushes the ‘still waiting for a response on friend request’ thing, and I accepted him as an fb friend near the beginning of May. I figured if he wanted to reach out to me, he now had the opportunity.

Last week we began chatting, comparing notes on how we might know each other and how many mutual friends we share irl. Things have escalated quickly between us, and I have plans to go stay at his place next Friday. 

I haven’t seen or heard from my former coworker since she left, and I truly hope she’s doing well. I don’t want her to find out about this most probable hookup because I have had ex bf’s hookup with my friends in the past, and it really fucking sucks. 

At the same time, he is single and has been for more than half a year. I’m not looking for a relationship, as I just got out of one, but he and I share many of the same interests (and kinks) and I would really love for him to be the first person I’ve slept with since I was married 8yrs ago.

bystb9	2019-06-10 03:16:13		WIBTA for confronting my mother about her husband	"(Warning this is going to be long probably) 

Oh boy where do I even start with him. 
They met a little bit after my parents divorce and at first things seemed ok and he seemed pretty down to earth. Unfortunately this didnt last long as he slowly started turning my mother into what he wanted. To start things off he turned my mother into an alcoholic and she began drinking constantly day and night. 

Then he turned her loving and caring nature into resentment and bitterness towards me and my brother. He made it so that own mother cared more for his children than us. It even got to the point that they planned a family trip that they where all going on in front of me knowing that they were not going to invite me. (My brother was finally old enough to move out at this point so I would be the only one not going) While my mom updated her timeline with a new family photo of them all smiling I was home crying. 

I'm not going to go into all of the shitty things he has done to me personally because then we would be here all day. I just want to get the point across to her that I think he is toxic and I only wants what's best for her. Over the years he would argue with her and trust me when I say that they were nasty to say the least. 

As of my knowledge he as never physically hurt her (at least was around) but to me that doesn't matter as he is an incredibly mentally manipulative and abusive person. 

Iv tried confronting in the past but she ended up choosing her husband over me and I can't even escape because he is friends with just the right people and can get things manipulated to his will. (Including the police force in our town and the judge that handles our custody issues)

I dont have a lot of people to talk to about this about but from pretty much everyone that I can that won't be baised (my dad) they act like I'm over exaggerating because I'm mad about the divorced. His kids think I'm spoiled and despise me and think the same. My mom thinks that I'm trying to cause unessicary drama and get attention. 

So would WIBTA? Is my mom right about it just being unessicary drama to bring it up? 
Every time there is an argument it effects the entire family (and more often then not going back to court for custody) Should I just listen to my friend and suck it up until I can move out instead of waiting everyones time?

I know that if I do this it's going to divide the family like it did with my brother but I feel like this time it might be worth it. I dont want to damage my relationship with her like he did but at the same time this isnt my mom anymore. I know court will cost money that we really dont have but I want to take that chance that maybe I will get my mother back.

Its to the point that I really do feel like I'm the ass here considering that's what I've been told by everybody."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So there was a dance for 8th graders only last week. It was free and it had many rules saying only dress attire but nothing over the top.
Everyone took this “dance” so seriously. I didn’t.
Now there is a girl, we’ve been talking for a LONG while now, she keeps asking me if im going to the dance. I say no there are better things I can do. (I ended up napping). Now many kids went there even if they had a girl to tag along or not. I jus didn’t want to go. It was my first and last year in this middle school. In the other school I went to, we had something like this, a bunch of middle schoolers in one room and do whatever you want while a “dj” plays music. The music was what was trending at the time and it sucked. I never went since. I told the girl what my experience was like. And she said it would be different. I said no and she was upset. I then went home and dozed off for a bit. I woke up with the nba finals on second quarter and I check the girls story. She said she had a great time but it would be better if someone else was there. There were also videos there and you guessed it, it was just like the other middle school.

I have recently taken to sleeping in the top bunk of my sisters now pretty much vacant room because the living room is loud and I'm a very light sleeper.

In the first weeks, we had a lot of fun together however after 4 months, our relationship became monotonous and I decided to end our relationship. 

Two years after the separation, my sister suffered from leukemia and we lost her shortly thereafter. While I was thinking of my own sadness and desperation, I saw my ex-girlfriend texting me (She sent messages saying about how sorry she was for losing my sister) but I found it a little weird because she didn't meet my sister and she didn't really know about her and after several messages on that day I noticed that she was trying to get close to me, but I wasn't pay no attention. Our messaging ended that day. We never talked until I returned to the city where I was studying.

After a while, I returned to the city where I was studying. Christmas was coming soon. At the insistence of my friends, I decided to join the Christmas party. Because they said I needed some fun and they wanted my mood to change. I'm glad they think of me.

My friends who invited me to the party were the ones who introduced me to my ex-girlfriend. Then I found out that my ex-girlfriend will come to the party from the city where she lived. I didn't react because recently I had lost my sister who was my best friend and the best person I know. I couldn't think of any relationship. On the day of the party, we were both very drunk, she kept saying that she missed the days we spent during our relationship and wanted to talk, so I told her we could talk in a quiet place and we went to my home and after that night we became a lover with her request. I didn't refuse because around that time I was feeling lonely.

Afterward, I isolated myself from life with the depressed state, I was responding to messages late, I was giving minimum information about what I did during the day, and my girlfriend was very complaining about this situation, but I thought she wanted to be a lover even though she knew about this situation. I felt that my girlfriend didn't support me at all because at the time my father was sick (cardiac). And my girlfriend was complaining all the time.

These conversations continued for 4 months and my girlfriend wanted to broke up with me, I accepted it calmly because I wasn't feeling a hundred percent love and dependance to my girlfriend and our relationship. She started shouting and crying when I accepted. She said that I didn't dare to broke up. Actually, she was right, and I've been thinking about that for a while because I wasn't mentally able to maintain the relationship.

He has lived with a friend, with all of his other his children, and now he has moved in with husband and I. He makes no real effort to find a job. Is picky in jobs he will apply for. Spends all day gaming. And currently he contributes nothing to our household other than basic chores at my request because I wanted him to know his assistance is not needed nor wanted and the situation is temporary.

Personal issues: I have pretty severe ptsd from a very very abusive childhood. I am uncomfortable around all older men. I feel this way even about immediate family members. It’s not personal, it is just I have a lot of damage I can’t undo. This situation has degraded my mental health to a serious degree and affected my ability to keep up with personal responsibility.

Husband point of view: He thinks that he can ‘fix’ his father by gently coaxing him into getting a job and being self sufficient. No progress has been made in 6 months. He promised me that the situation would end after 6 months and no job, but he hasn’t made any effort to take rein of the situation.

My point of view: This situation is literally killing me. I’m anxious all the time. I’m depressed all the time. My nightmares are full throttle. I’m angry. I want to put my foot down and demand he gets kicked out, but I fear hurting my relationship with husband, and I also don’t like getting on the bad side of anyone.

Would I be in the wrong to demand he gets kicked out? I feel like I’m selfish, and that my ptsd is my problem and I shouldn’t bother others with it.

From the beginning of our friendship, Ian told me that he absolutely wasn’t looking for a relationship. I was looking for a boyfriend and I really liked Ian, but I decided that I’d continue being friends with him and hooking up with him until I found a relationship. He continued to use various dating apps and hook up with other people. Whenever we hung out, it was strictly about sex. We were friends and we got along really well but the only thing we ever did when we hung out was have sex. 

Fast forward to a few years since Ian and I started hooking up. We were still hooking up casually. I had a temporary job opportunity in another city and I moved there, but I only had to move there for 6 months and I knew this going into it. Ian and I maintained a bit of communication when I moved, but again, nothing serious at all. A few weeks into living in the new city, I met someone we’ll call John and began casually dating him. Things got more serious with John, but I thought it was kind of ridiculous to get into a relationship with him because I was about to move thousands of miles away. We parted ways when I left and I honestly thought I’d never see him again. 

I came back home and started hooking up with Ian again, not mentioning John to him at all. A few weeks after Ian and I got back into it, John and I had a couple long talks and we decided we both really like each other and want to try for a long distance relationship. So I told Ian that we can’t hook up anymore and explained the situation. He‘s now absolutely livid. He told me I’m a liar for hiding my relationship with John from him and I completely caught him off guard. I tried to tell him that this caught me off guard too and I didn’t know that I was going to be in a relationship with John but he didn’t wanna hear it. I never thought it was necessary to tell Ian about John because we weren’t in an exclusive relationship and I didn’t expect to ever see John again. When I lived in another city I hardly talked to Ian, and I never thought it would be appropriate or necessary to bring up my sex life with other people.

Im a dude and im in highschool. Im not very outgoing or sociable. Actually im a pretty big introvert, and socializing drains me a lot, so you can imagine there are many times in school where i am not in a talking mood. 
Im assuming since this is reddit that a lot of you can relate. Anyway theres this kid who i have some mutual friends with. Hes about my age i think. Hes very outgoing really likes making friends etc. at some point he started trying to interact with me. At first i thought he was making fun of me but he kept doing it and i realized that wasnt it. It was just small stuff like saying hi or something like that. i didnt really have plans to become great criends with him or anything but whatever. We were friendly. 
Fast forward and he starts making even more of an effort. Like actual full conversations. Then, over a weekend, out of the blue he texts me. I never gave him my number. That weirded me out enough. But he starts asking me questions about myself and trying to get to know me. 
I know this is maybe bad but just as some extra info hes openly bi. He said in his texts that he just wanted to be friends but some of his texts felt sort of invasive. Like at one point he asked me why i didnt go to a party our mutual friend threw a few weeks ago and then said i need to let myself have fun. I had barely had two full conversations in person with him at that point. 
Basically i was uncomfortable and trying to end the conversation by giving short answers. He kept persisting and then finally got the hint and just straight up said: im not an idiot i get that you want me to leave you alone so bye. 
Ive been feeling guilty. I feel like i shouldve handled it better. I think the turning point was just that he asked me why i was so hard to talk to and that i should relax a little and that just kind of made me shut down.

So I'm a furry and I like to draw monster characters and fantasy stuff a lot. Nothing too weird, mostly cartoony animals with swords.

My friend designed a character for an adoptable (if you don't know what those are, essentially they're pre-designed characters you pay for, and then you can do what you want with the design).

The thing is, my friend made a character for sale that was essentially a COPY of my main fursona, except with a single color swapped out. Everything else was the same (same fur markings, species, eyes, hair, even same accessory...) the resemblance was uncanny.

The sold the design for $50. I was mad, but didn't say anything because whatever...it's not that big of a deal and i can always modify my character. Fast forward a few months, I get a message on furaffinity that the person who bought the character is essentially accusing me of stealing a character that THEY bought with money. The situation escalates and essentially I told them to ask my friend for a refund. The person responded by making a callout post and using screencaps of me telling them that the design wasn't fully made by the artist.

Now my friend is pissed at me and calling me an asshole, but i was still mad at them for stealing from me.

"My youngest sister graduated high school today (sidenote, SO PROUD OF HER) and my mom had a wonderful graduation brunch for her before the ceremony to celebrate. I brought my sister's present to my mom's party and celebrated this milestone there with her side of the family. 

My parents have been divorced for about 12 years now, and dealing with things like graduations are always kind of awkward and hard to plan. On top of that, my dad is a less than wonderful father, my stepmom is dense and overall not a good person, and both of them suck at communicating. This morning, I received a text message letting me know that my sister ""wanted"" to get dinner tonight after she graduates. My dad is very manipulative, so the quotation marks are there just let you know that she really didn't want to. I told him that I wasn't up for it, that I needed to run errands tonight, and more than anything else was just too last minute.

I took pictures with my sister at the brunch, attended the ceremony, cheered her on, and let her know how proud of her I am. I think I sufficiently celebrated her and her achievements, but my sibling made me feel bad about not going to the dinner. Saying something along the lines of, ""If I have to sit through the dinner why don't you?"" I said you don't, you chose to go, and left it at that. Am I justified in leaving after the ceremony was over? Am I the asshole for not going to the dinner? Let me know Reddit.

Tldr; I didn't go to my sister's graduation dinner with my dad and stepmom because the invite was too late, I needed to run errands, and had already celebrated her achievement with my mom's side of the family. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	33.0	12.0	0.0	0.0
bysmll	2019-06-10 02:56:13	ChoosingIsHardToday	AITA for telling my SO he can't play rough in the house with a dog?	"For context, we don't have a really big place to begin with and the dog we are thinking about taking in (it's a dog we know already) is a high energy breed. (We're thinking of taking her in because her current owner isn't giving her enough exercise but won't give her up unless we take her. Also we all live this dog like crazy.) When we first started talking about it, I said that it's important that we be on the same page about rules and discipline and he agreed but we hadn't really discussed what that meant.


Today we were talking about how we would schedule exercise and adequate play time. During this conversation I mentioned the way he plays with his family dog when we visit his parents and said that he couldn't play like that in the house. (Rough housing, throwing the ball, other things that get her jumping all over the place - they almost knocked over the Christmas tree last year playing) I said if he wants to play like that, he would have to take her outside. I said it's fine to play in the house in ways that don't get her too hyper. 


He got upset and said (paraphrased) ""what am I supposed to do, live outside?"" I told him not to be ridiculous, dogs don't need to rough play 24/7 and that just when he wants to play rough like that, they can play outside. He argued and I said, well I guess we can't get a dog then.


I don't think it's unreasonable to ask someone not to throw balls and not to do things that cause the dog to jump around (mostly I just don't want her to jump around and bump into the furniture and risk her getting hurt) in the house. He, clearly, thinks I'm being unreasonable and is sulking now.


AITA? If I am being TA then what can I do? We both really want to take this dog in, I'm just worried about her getting hurt playing rough in a small space and don't think it's crazy to ask him to play like that, outside.

My brother is 16, and like many teen boys, enjoys talking with lots of girls on social media. Some of the girls are just casual chats, while others are a bit flirtatious and open. Well, a few days ago one of these girls became a bit more open, per say, with my brother. He accepted her advances, and then moved on to the other girls he speaks who also deliver similar material. I mentioned to my brother that this is toeing the line, and that he shouldn’t let this girl fawn over him if he is speaking to other girls in a similar manner. He and his friends disagreed, saying he never spoke about a relationship with any of these girls, even the ones who flirt with him. 
I respect his POV, but at times he definitely sends flirty texts to other girls, and I feel he may be leading some of these girls on, allowing for so many open conversations. He is 100% right he never spoke about relationships, and talking/flirting  with people is ok, but I feel like these girls may not be understanding my brothers motivations when speaking with them.

I worked in a cafe/bistro/ what-have-you in a retirement home. I loved the residents and have made close relationships with them as if they were my own grandparents. I worked really hard to please everyone of the residents and keep the area clean and going beyond what was required in the process. My coworkers even commented on how empathetic and kind I was with the residence and it was because I did truly care about them. Anyways, I only worked weekends for the year I worked there because of school and a week ago I put in my two weeks after my family sold our house and we would be moving in 2 1/2 weeks. A few days ago my dad told me I couldn’t go into work this weekend bc we were no longer going to be moving in 1 1/2 weeks but 1/2 a week bc dates got changed and we have to be out by this Wednesday. (I hope this is making sense) I told my manager that I was incredibly sorry for the late notice but that I wouldn’t make it in because of this unexpected change and I was sorry for the inconvenience. 
Side note: my manager is a pain in the rear. She is a snake. A good wholesome Christian woman who likes to let everyone know that but talks so bad behind people’s backs and twist words and is a hypocrite.
Anyways, she tells me “ok”
I then get a text from my general manager, who I really look up to for approval and in general. He has been so kind and understanding, and my heart drops:
“I was told that you are not working out your two week notice. I’m really disappointed. 
You will not be able to get a reference and you will not be eligible for rehire.”

I think my manager didn’t tell him the whole situation. I was taken back by his response.
I explained to him the situation, how sorry I was, how I was both looking forward to my last day and also very sad to leave bc I loved working there and would miss both the residence and my coworkers.  
He hasn’t replied.
I asked my 2 coworkers what they thought and they said it seemed like I had no other choice. And I didn’t. It was out of my control. Should I apologize in person???"	Not the A-hole	0	0	136.0	19.0	0.0	0.0

My brother isn't my actual blood brother but rather my roommate and best friend since 6th grade. we're in our twenties now. we'll call him ""C""  Now for his gf who we'll call ""M""

around the time c and m started to get to know each other, M and me kind of hit it off too and become pretty good friends. Purely platonic on both ends. I've been single since 2017, and i'm not particularly a fan of hearing about other peoples relationships. M has asked me before on several occasions what she can do to be a better friend. Now M can be extremely obnoxious when it comes to bragging about her and C. I told her if she could tone that down, I'd really appreciate it. She agrees. But continues to do it. This isn't fully related to the main issue but it leads into it. Now C works 3rd shift. Which means he goes into work late around 10PM and doesn't get home until morning. so he sleeps during the day a lot of the time.  so as a result M often asks me to wake up C for their dates.  the thing about me is,  I don't like waking ANYBODY up. especially not for somebody else. especially, especially not for a date I'm for sure going to hear an earful about. But I always complied and did it anyways. Today however, I woke up with a killer migraine, and my depression spiked. I was off work, so I was bedridden pretty much the entire day. and when M sent me a DM asking me to wake up C, I left her on read knowing I would probably say something nasty.  she tried again and I ignored her. eventually C got up on his own and went out. She texted me ""nvm he got up"" I sent a passive aggressive thumbs up emoji. which prompted her to ask why I was mad at her

&#x200B;

this is what I said word for word

""Just stop asking me to wake him up. you're both adults. handle it amongst yourselves""

I know I PROBABLY overreacted but i'm curious to hear your opinions

EDIT-
I probably should've mentioned that M had a sense that asking me all the time got on my nerves a little. Since she apologized a few times for it and always said it would be the last time"	Not the A-hole	0	0	228.0	259.0	0.0	0.0

bysjp0	2019-06-10 02:47:24	lollipocket3	AITA for ghosting my best friend?	"   My best friend of 6 years visited me about a year ago for a week and brought her boyfriend that I had never met. They stayed with my and I gave them my bedroom and everything. A week before the trip I had to make the most difficult decision of my life and go through with an abortion after a conversation with my doctor about how great of a risk a pregnancy posed to my health. I was distraught, but I talked with her and we agreed it would be a good distraction for me and nice to have a friend close by at that time. 

Fast forward to the actual visit and she doesn’t leave her boyfriends side for one minute, (literally they even went to the bathroom together) I chauffeured them around and they sat in the back seat together while I drove, and I did not get a moment alone with her to talk about how I was feeling. 

I get that this was her vacation, but she knew I was struggling and it would have been nice if just once she pulled me aside just the two of us and asked how I was doing. Emotionally exhausted from having to play the gracious host when I was a mess, I broke into tears the final night and she apologized but it didn’t seem genuine at all. It was the hardest time in my life and I needed a friend and she wasn’t there for me. 

Since then, I haven’t bothered talking to her. It hurts and I do miss her, but she let me down so much. She messaged me recently and I just don’t know what to say anymore. AITA for not wanting to make time in my life for her anymore?

edit: That was also her first time meeting my boyfriend. Him, only caring about how I felt, disliked her already two days in. He and his friend cancelled plans to stay home and play board games with us to make sure I was included. He was completely attentive to me and me alone and was civil with them but otherwise didn’t bother. At the end of the week she told me she didn’t like him because he had friends over and didn’t make an effort to include her boyfriend."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I had applied to all kinds of jobs all spring, but had no luck at the time. I really wanted to work at the Chick-Fil-A in my town, and applied online and on paper but never heard back. A few weeks ago, I heard that the CFA in the next town over was having open interviews. I went, interviewed with the owner, and got the job on the spot. Several of my friends that live in that town got hired as well. Earlier this week I attended orientation, and they ordered my uniform. I was perfectly content, until last night when a manager from my local CFA called and asked me to come interview tomorrow. I agreed to set up an interview, but now I’m feeling pretty guilty. Everyone from the CFA I was hired at was so nice and welcoming. I’m supposed to start training this week, and I don’t know if I should quit if the other location decides to give me a job. The location in my town is slightly closer to my house, and much closer to my school. It would be a lot more convenient, but I really just hate to flake out on the people that already hired me. I’m also worried that my friends who got hired with me will be upset with me for taking a different opportunity. I told my friend that I was thinking about working at another location, and she got really upset with me.

I was the best man at his wedding and our kids have grown together.  We are now in our 40's.  He used to be in the Air Force but was medically discharged for back issues.  I believe he was at 80% disability.  He currently works full time as a GS employee and makes great money between that and his Air Force pay. He recently sat down with me and said he wanted my help to find a better, nicer home for him as he was successfully able to get 100% disability and will no longer have to pay taxes on his property and where we are located, that's a significant amount.

bysfcx	2019-06-10 02:34:27	hunter15991	AITA for browsing my phone instead of watching the road or driving while going with my dad to help my sister move out?	"(I swear I'm not trying to make a clickbait title - I'm having issues finding good wording and I guess this sounds like ""AITA for being a distracted driver"" which is not the subject of the post.)

I'm a 21M, currently living with my parents (including 70M dad) this summer before grad school starts. They're great people, I love 'em - but sometimes we have flareups. I may be the asshole in this one, which is why I'm here.

Due to a birth defect, one of my eyes is blind, and my parents and I have been nervous about getting me behind the wheel to start driving. I'm currently finishing up classes with a great company that have taken me from complete mess to ""perfectly normal driver"". During my past lesson I drove 2 hours straight on the highway.

This was all done in a Kia Soul, a small compact car. My parents have been trying to get me additional driving experience in their car, a Honda Odyssey (minivan). I've been taking most of these opportunities, practicing with my dad on unused side streets and whatnot. Just this morning I drove the van to and from the gym we go to, roughly 3 miles away.

About an hour later it was time for us to help my sister move out of her apartment near her university, about 27 miles away. I had volunteered to do this last night with my dad instead of my mom. Originally I was told ""we already have enough help"" before I insisted I go instead of my mom. My dad suggested I drive there, and I objected.

Fast forward to today - I got more pushback from him. ""Are you SURE you don't want to drive? You won't get better without practice."" etc. 

I explained that I was very uncomfortable driving for such a distance and that I'd rather build up experience on shorter routes. My experience in the Kia wasn't fully comparable given its completely different road presence, handling, etc.

He acquiesced and we drove off. I was browsing my phone on the way there to kill time. Turning onto the highway he started asking if I knew how to get on (yes, I did). He asked me to watch him do it and put my phone down.

I refused.

This really pissed him off, and he started ranting about how everything is a battle with me - I had to be forced to help out today (this was a rare instance I volunteered and insisted I help), I never wanted to even sit in the front seat (a hesitation I only had a decade ago), and that I was missing valuable practice time (I've probably spent a few months of my life staring out the car windows and it did nothing to help me). This segued into less-related complaints about my work ethic, weight, etc.

Near the end I decided to watch just to shut him up, and noticed multiple traffic violations (at least nominally) - failure to signal, doing 10-15 over in an interchange, crossing multiple lanes at once, etc. Asking him why he was doing that was met with even more complaints.

We loaded my sister's stuff and then he drove us back, giving me the silent treatment on the return and during most of the move-out.

byserr	2019-06-10 02:32:44		AITA for not wanting to lend/give my (19F) parents (51F, 50M) all my money?	"This has happened before. When I started my part-time job in December 2018, all my pay from December - April which totalled to about $5.5k SGD went into my joint savings account with my mother. 

A while ago, she texted me to ask if I could lend my father money because his company was having cash flow problems. I replied and asked how much, she said whatever I was comfortable with, before changing her mind and saying everything, though I told her I was comfortable with lending $1k. After a few days she withdrew all the money in that savings account and only let me know after she had done it. I was angry/upset, because that was all the money I had and because I worked so damn hard for the money??? I work 12 hour shifts on my feet without proper breaks, I used to do 5-6 days a week but have since cut my days down to 2-3. 

After that, I headed to the bank to sign up for my own bank account in case my mother would try to withdraw money without asking me, and my pay would be put into that account from May onwards. 

Now, my mother has texted to ask to borrow money again. I have $1.7k in my bank account. This was how the conversation went, M for Mother and me for me.

M: If u r not using the money try ur best to help. I'm sure u dont want anything bad to daddy.
M: He is under tremendous pressure. These ppl can take legal action. Landlord can lock up the pl n refuse entry
me: I don't even have money you already took it
me: $1000
M: Ur pay so low only

Am I the asshole for not wanting to lend the other $700 that I have left in my bank account? Honestly I'm kind of glad I didn't make it to university this year because I was going to use all that money to pay for university... I was thinking I still have to pay for transport, food, going out with friends (which I rarely do). I haven't asked my parents for money since I started working part-time. I'm also afraid I'll never get the money back.

byseqg	2019-06-10 02:32:37		AITA for indirectly making someone feel guilty about the way they live?	"My partner and I were at my Dad's house for dinner the other night. We have very different value sets, and because of that we live in very different ways.

My partner and I live off-grid in a tiny house that we built out of second hand materials, we grow lots of our own food, and go without lots of things that most people wouldn't even consider to be a luxury (dishwasher, hot water, single car etc). We choose to live like this because it helps keep our environmental impact down - which is important to us, and keeps living costs extremely low, which means we can survive on my single part-time income - enabling us to spend lots of time doing the things we value like staying home to raise our 1 year old, and volunteering to help people in our community who are struggling.

My parents are more traditional. Dad is a really clever guy and managed to end up with an extremely high paying salary for most of his working life, he saved hard, invested wisely, and retired at 55. He now makes enough money from his investments to maintain a reasonably lavish lifestyle (3+ international holidays per year, etc). His wife is younger and runs her own successful business. Both are really money focused, and neither is concerned with their environmental impact, or the plight of those less fortunate who haven't had the same opportunities that they have had. My partner and I don't mind at all that they live like this - each to their own.

Anyway, we were chatting after dinner, and having had a few drinks. My partner was talking about how she's stuck in the dilemma of choosing between starting an early childhood center which provides the best possible opportunities for the children (which would mean fees would be high and would effectively exclude lower socio-economic families), or a basic service which would have low fees, be inclusive of all families, but not be able to provide the highest standard of service/opportunities for the children. Then all of a sudden my Dad's wife blows up, and starts berating us for being ""snobs"", that we've always come across as snobs sitting on high horses, that poor people don't have it that bad, they don't need more support, and that she's sick of her tax dollars going to people who ""don't need it"" - along with insulting us about being ungrateful etc. In her defense, she had had a few drinks.

Nonetheless, we were pretty stunned.

We're really conscious of exactly what she was talking about - that the way we live can make some people feel uncomfortable, and that it can come across as us trying to be ""better"" than other people - and because of that we're really careful not to say things that would make anyone feel like that. It's something we always avoid intensely because we fear reactions like hers.

The evening was obviously pretty awkward after that...

bysdsc	2019-06-10 02:29:52	throwmyrazeaway	AITA for telling my ex-boyfriend off because he told me I was the reason he self-harmed	"Throwaway account.

Ex-boyfriend, we’ll call Greg, (29M) and I (23F) had a long-term relationship that ended amicably over a year ago. Being Greg’s first girlfriend, I saw a bigger importance in communicating how I felt and trusted that he did the same.

After the relationship ended, where it seemed we were both over each other, we had become good friends. We hung out sporadically throughout the months and all was well.

One day while we were hanging out, I was complaining to him about my daily dilemmas, as per usual. I told him how a “friend” came on to me and I said something along the lines of “I don’t understand where he got the impression that I liked him if I’ve been deliberately acting like a bitch to him, not that I am a bitch-“ Greg cut me off with “you kind of are a bitch.” 

Now mind you, Greg and I treated each other with love and respect before, during, and after the relationship. We never fought or spoke down to each other. This line was obviously out of character for him and took me by surprise. 

I felt sick to my stomach and aggressively forced an explanation out of him. He angrily laid one on me, saying that I had made him feel worse about himself and his situation (dead end job); that I was the reason why he started cutting himself. 

This came as a shock to me because from my POV in the relationship, we were supportive of each other through and through. He was characteristically insecure, but never expressed depression. 

I asked “are you looking for pity or trying to make me feel bad about myself?” Further, I said that that’s a disgusting emotion to hold against me when I hadn’t knowingly done anything wrong or vindictive to him in the relationship. If I had, he should have told me immediately or before he started cutting. Also, it seemed to me that he was blaming me for all that was wrong in his life during the time we were dating and he should re-evaluate himself. 

After I was done freaking out, Greg drove me home. I asked if maybe he needs help and he said he‘s completely better. He said he regrets saying what he did and wishes that we return to how things were before that statement. I told him no, that if he felt that way then there’s obviously some unresolved issues we should address. He said there wasn’t and urges that we move on. I don’t know if he still feels I’m to blame or if what I said made him think differently. 

Either way, I feel awful about what happened. AITA for my reaction to his statement or was that called for?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Most of them were amazing, and I complimented a few of them because I absolutely respect the hard the work they put into these things. They thanked me, which is basic politeness. 

At one point, I saw someone in a cosplay I didn't really recognise so I asked her who she was cosplayed as. She just stared at me as I asked if she was this one character. She ended up turning away and taking to her friend. I didn't interrupt their conversation or anything so I felt that she was being really rude. 

I always thought if you cosplayed, you would want people to notice and appreciate the hard work you put in, so you would be open to talking. At the very least, she could have nodded or shook her head.

AITA?

My family knows I think cards are a waste of money and I think the best way to say happy birthday is to spend the day with someone. I spent all day from 10 am to 9 pm with her and our family. My older brother got her a pretty expensive gift though myself and my younger brother got her nothing. My dad just railed on me in the living room afterwards.

I understand in retrospect that getting a card would’ve made this a null issue, but am I really that terrible of a son for not getting her a card? For the record, I’m also in grad school and constantly get called out for the slightest purchase I make since I’m not able to have a job right now. If I had tons of money I’d love to buy her and my family great gifts, but I’m constantly worried about rent and even a small thing like a card just seems stupid considering it’ll go straight in the trash. My parents constantly say not to get them anything, so this seems a bit hypocritical to me.

tl;dr Mom always says not to buy her gifts or cards. I always say cards are pointless and I’ll tell you in person how I feel. Mom is now mad I didn’t buy her a card"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

bys5pk	2019-06-10 02:06:38	sadpoetgirl	AITA For Cutting My “Tough Love” Mom Out Of My Life?	"I am a 43F single mom of a 13M. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 12 years. About two months ago, I was having a terrible period in my life, and made some changes all at once. I quit my job, moved back to my hometown, ended my relationship, and went off all my meds. It was a very hard couple of months for both myself and my son. We are both starting to feel better and things are getting back to a good place. I am on different meds and have started a new job. My son is doing pretty good at school and is happy to be back in our hometown. 

The issue is that my ex-fiancé got ahold of my mother when we first moved out to let her know what was happening and that I was not in a good place. My son also reached out to my mother when he was feeling particularly down and wanted someone to talk to. She basically blew him off and never bothered to check back on him again. She never contacted me to check in either.

Some backstory: she believes in “tough love” and “codependency” and believes this means that it’s ok to just basically ignore her children (all 3 of us are adults) if they are struggling, or unhappy, or even need to just talk. By ignore, I mean she has already cut my youngest brother (39 yrs) out of her life because he struggles with PTSD and alcoholism and will not check himself into a hospital which is what she thinks he should do. So she refuses to have anything to do with him and basically pretends he doesn’t exist.

In regards to me, she abandoned me at age 1 to be with the man she cheated on my father with and her two babies she had with him. She did eventually get visitation rights and I saw her on the weekends for years. She was physically and verbally abusive for most of my childhood towards me and my (half-) brothers as well. She smoked pot constantly and drank a lot too. 

Over the years I have done a lot of therapy and pretty much got over most of my issues with her, and have had what I thought was a pretty good relationship with her for about 15 years. It was always up and down, but I just went with the flow and up to now, she has been a decent grandmother. 

Fast forward to now. She hasn’t spoken one word to me since I told her I quit my job two months ago, and as I mentioned, she blew my son off when he tried contacting her when he was upset and worried about me. I honestly never expected her to help me in any way, but a check-in to see if we were ok would have been nice. Now that I know she blew off my son, I am furious and hurt. 

I want to cut her out of my life completely but my best friend thinks I should give her another chance. I think it’s bad enough that she deserts her own children but now that she has deserted mine, I am done. AITA for wanting to just cut the cord and be done with her for good?

I (F, 23) love my brother (M, 21) dearly. I also love his girlfriend (F, 19) and was friends with her before she and my brother started dating. 

I invited my brother and my dad over to mine and my husband’s (M, 23) house for dinner this week. My brother immediately texted me and asked if he could bring his girlfriend as well. I haven’t texted back yet.

Last night I was on gridnr (a gay dating app) and I started talking to this guy. We will call him Aidan. He sent me through a photo of himself but told me he was discreet and that he doesnt want to give socials. Howeverthe photo he sent looked like a guy i knew from school but i went on with it and just thought the guy from school (we'll call Brock) was actually gay.

 I gave him my phone number and we talked on the phone with his number on private. I ask him for his age and he tells me hes 25. I find this strange because Brock is not 25. Aidan proceeds to tell me a story where he uses his first name in 3rd person by accident.  I tell him I have to go because at this poiny i know for sure Aidan isnt brock.

I message brock on msnger and tell him that someone is not only stealing his photos but pretending to be him. And that i manage to track down Aidan and find out who it was. Brock asks me for his name and im very hesitant because Aidan isnt out.

However. These are the circumstances.
Aidan has pretended to be Brock previously with me
Aidan has done this before and stolen Brocks Identity
I was not the first person to message Brock about this incident. 

So with hesitation I give Brock his name so he can block him and sort it out himself etc. AITA for giving Brock his name?

(Hubby is not going either. )	"Every year we have a family reunion for my husband’s grandparents wedding anniversary in June.   Due to gpa turning 90, this year it has been moved to September 1, which is hubby and my anniversary.   My husband mentioned going, but I said no. My hubby conceded when I pointed out that he wouldn’t spend our anniversary with my extended family (which he can’t stand 95% of the time) if the tables were turned. BTW, it’s also a 2+ hour drive one-way to attend this event and we have 2 children in tow. 

Now, a little back story. His grandmother has NEVER been friendly towards me, and I find his grandfather to be obnoxious and temperamental. Plus, the grandparents come to our town several times a year to visit my FIL, but have NEVER stopped or even asked to stop to see our house in the 17 years we have lived here.   They literally drive right by our house to get to my FIL’s. Most of the time, we aren’t even told they’re in town until after the fact. 

My hubby told my FIL that we aren’t attending due to it being our anniversary, and my FIL is upset with me.  He says I’m being selfish because grandpa will only turn 90 once.  When it comes to the grandparents, I am told, “This may be our last (fill-in-the-blank-event) with them. They are getting on in years, you know. “ 19 years, I have heard this for 19 years.   We almost always attend his family’s events.  Of my husband’s siblings, we are the most reliable when it comes to attending and arriving on time.  

Now add more fuel to the fire. Over the past 19 years, it’s hit or miss if my husband attends my family’s events.   Last year, I decided to prove a point of how badly it sucks to not have your spouse go to events with you and skipped this particular family reunion.  My kids and husband did attend, but my reason for not being there was not relayed to anyone.  Due to this absence, my FIL is now convinced that I just don’t want to be around any of them. 

But wait, there’s more. A couple months ago my FIL  discovered I’m an atheist and there was a conversation all about it, which I welcome. However, now it’s being used as a reason I’m not going to said event, because I don’t have Christian values and don’t understand the importance of family.

It's pretty hardcore, no beds to respawn at a safe location, no easy storage and no built in clans to prevent friendly fire and a hour and a half trek to get across the map without distractions. 

Ok now you understand where I am coming from now let me get to why I am curious if I am in fact the asshole. There is storage but it comes in the form of items you have to carry to where you want them because they aren't secure, when I started playing with my friends they had 600 storage (a large tent 400 and a medium 200) that they all shared but I hadn't taken a single thing from. 

It had been days of hours of searching but I found three 200 slot tents within two hours today and brang two of them back (I would have taken all three but one of them was very persistent on taking one). When I get back I have a bunch of things I couldn't use at that time so I shoved them in a tent and said I claim this one. 

Well about an hour later another guy gets on and starts throwing my stuff out saying what's all this crap and I said playfully (at first) ""Hey that's my tent get out)"" to which he kinda blows up saying ""No you don't get your own tent"". We argued a little and it put me off playing for the day but am I in the wrong? 

Hope this wasn't more of a boring rant and was still atleast a little relevant/understandable to people who don't play video games.

A few years before I moved I bought a TTR 125 bike that I hardly ever used, I used it so little in fact that It needed a new battery from just sitting in the garage. This was the only fault with it though, it was worth around $1600 at the time i left. 

Upon leaving, my best friend at the time, the person i had spent almost every day with for 7+ years asked if he could borrow it while i was gone so i allowed it. He then offered to ask around and see if anyone wanted to buy it and even fix the battery for me. I thought this was just a general act of kindness since we had been so close for so long. I told him specifically not to sell it until i got back even if he found buyers, i wanted to be there to collect the money. 

Over the course of the year i was away this friend ended up dating and later moving in with my first cousin, we live in a small town so this wasn’t that surprising. 

When i returned to the states i realized that i needed a bit more side cash so i attempted to reach out multiple times to my friend to return my bike, he hadn’t mentioned anything about selling it the whole year i was gone. 

After having both mine, my other friends and even my mothers numbers blocked on his phone, my cousin finally came forward an informed me that the bike hadn’t been at their house in quite a while. 

As it turns out he had wrecked it and then sold it for $900 and was just going to ignore me. It wasn’t until I finally reached him and threatened to call the cops that he told me he would pay me back in full for it over the course of a few weeks as he gets paid every Friday. 

It’s been two weeks, i havent seen a dime and none of my messages are getting replies. 

In any other situation I’d be quick to just throw the whole friendship away, call the cops and have it settled in small claims court or something. 

The issue is that I’m catching a lot of grief from both of our families over the obvious ties and how it’s going to affect my cousin if he feels unwelcome around our family after this and it was essentially my fault for handing over my property to a known drug user. I just kind of figured 7 years of smooth sailing friendship meant something to him. 

I can’t afford to throw $1600 down the drain over a poor case of character judgment so the opinions of my family dont mean much to me at this point but i thought I’d get a second opinion anyway. Thanks in advance!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	4.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

When I (f18) was around 3-4 years old I was diagnosed with ASD (autism). It didn't really affect my ability to complete tasks independently or anything. Just a lot of sensory issues and struggles with socialization, a lot of with got better as I got older. However, some sensory related issues have been pretty permanent. Having these issues triggered results in me having severe nervous breakdowns. They are all very specific issues and have been explained in detail to my mother by both me and a psychiatrist. It's mostly really loud noises, bright lights, multiple people talking to me at once, pretty typical stuff for the condition. 

My mother triggers all of them, frequently. Examples include playing loud music when I am trying to sleep, scolding me and allowing my siblings to continuously join in, talking over me when I try to explain that I am uncomfortable, and that is just a few. These things typically overwhelm me and push me into nervous breakdowns where I either get frustrated and aggressive or overwhelmed and just break down and cry. At which point she tells me how oversensitive I am and goes on about how I always snap for no reason or explode over nothing. I have explained time and time again that isn't nothing but rather very specific sensory issues, as well as my psychiatrist, but its met with eye rolls or accusations that I just don't love her. I try so hard to keep from breaking down because I don't to upset her but it's really hard sometimes. I get so scared and overwhelmed and it happens multiple times a week.

byrypw	2019-06-10 01:47:00		AITA For not wanting to have anything to do with my extended family?	"My parents divorced a while ago, when I was very young. It fucked me up pretty bad. I'm talking major anxiety and trust issues. 2 years later my dad remarried and along came my almost full Italian stepfamily. I was a very picky eater when I was young, and I never liked anything they cooked (until i was older) and it got to the point where my father cooked me a separate meal for me, which further ostracized me from an already somewhat rogue culture to me. 

All of them were athletic and very into sports. I was into video games and coding. It was an uphill struggle that I continually grew to dislike. Most of the time I was either alone and on my phone or with my dad.

But with encouragement from my father and enough time, I was gradually included into the group. It was going well now, I enjoyed the food and the company, the two most vital things in Italian culture. I started enjoying the meet ups. Things were coming together. I almost felt like I was apart of the family. 

But then... A family ""argument"" happened. To this day I have no idea how it started, what it was about, or how the fuck two adults would be so void of brain cells. For four years. Four long years,  I never saw any of the people I had formed relationships with. I was so confused and hurt when I would get cold shoulders from my stepcousins and their parents. I haven't forgotten, and I never will.

At the end of those four years, the people I knew had changed, evolved, the connections I had made were gone. My stepfamily seemed eager to be back together again. I was not. I will never be.

I keep getting told to forgive and forget, to move on and just let go. I don't think I can. I don't want to. I want to be far far away from this family."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My son is playing baseball competitively this year and we spend a lot of time on the weekends training before he starts high school. He’s really into it and I like helping him get better.

My stepdaughter will come into the yard while we’re practicing and insist on participating. I asked her once to let us be, and my wife crucified me for it. I also let her participate once but didn’t slow down my throws, hits, and running at all because I’m trying to make my son better, not cater to my stepdaughter. That also upset my wife and she said it was dangerous and rude to my stepdaughter. My wife expects me to either slow down and let her play, or carve out equal time to spend playing catch with my daughter separately. I don’t have the time to do that so I’d have to cut back on training my son, to his detriment.

My wife accused me of favoritism and that I’m intentionally excluding my stepdaughter. She claims this is different from the fact that she spends less time with my son than with my stepdaughter because she claims that’s because of age difference, but still expects me to spend equal time with the kids. Am I the asshole for not wanting my stepdaughter to intrude on our practice time and not wanting to cut back the practice time?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byrx1v	2019-06-10 01:42:03	Throwingthisaway3339	WIBTA if I stopped allowing others to use the clubhouse built for me when I was little?	"Title probably sounds childish and petty but hear me out. I’m currently 22, graduating college in December. So obviously I’m not home very much because of that. But at my family home, there’s a treehouse built for me when I was little. Like, 7 or 8. 

I hung out in that place for years, and a lot of my childhood memories and possessions are out there. Books, drawings, toys, and stuff like that. 

These days my brother and his friends often use it to hang out and do whatever teenagers do these days, and recently so has one of my cousins. I wouldn’t have a problem with that at all. I want it to be something that people enjoy for years to come, just like I did. 

The reason why I want to tell these kids to GTFO (in nicer terms of course) is because there have been several times that I’ve gone out there while at home and found it trashed. Mud all over the carpets, air soft pellets strewn all over the floor, stuff like that. What makes it worse though is that I’ve also found my personal possessions intentionally trashed. 

My books torn apart with pages thrown everywhere (not something that would happen on its own in an inclosed space), a horse that I was given by my grandparents when I was little strung up by a noose, the whiteboard that was out there with dicks drawn all over it in Sharpie, etc. Also, that stuff was in cabinets and drawers. They could have hung out in there without even knowing it was there, let alone touching it. They had to have gone digging and intentionally destroyed it. 

I’ve told my brother that he and his friends need to keep it clean several times, and now I’m just fed up with it. I want to tell them to stay out and buy a padlock that only I know the combination to for the doors. When they mature enough to use it properly they can go back in, but until then I want my stuff respected and my clubhouse stayed out of. 

WIBTA for doing that?

Edit: the teenagers in question are 16-17 years old. Old enough in my mind to know not to just recklessly destroy property in a place that they’re being allowed to hang out in. As for moving the possessions, my parents don’t really have space in the house, and I can’t take them back to college with me for the same issues of space."	Not the A-hole	0	0	9.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

She's married and has a baby but the husband has got a lot of issues. Like he is threatening her by saying he's going to take a knife to his wrists if she leaves him.

Now my roommate has been flirting with her a bunch, he's aware of the rocky relationship but he has really fallen for her. He already had her at the apartment two nights in a row to escape the husband and supposedly she has no where else to go. 

While he was working my roommate dropped the question if I could handle living with a baby for two months, despite me telling him repeatedly I'm not living with a baby especially because I smoke pot and have lots of friends over and during the night time hours. He is sold on this being her only choice and I told him this really shouldn't be our place to be getting involved. Especially since she hasn't divorced him or anything. 

I told him no, she can't move in with her baby. Not only would it be an awful experience for myself but I can't imagine any positive outcome coming out for either one of them. AITI?

EDIT: Thank you all for your replies, I was so happy to hear I wasn't alone in thinking this is bad. What I ended up doing is calling my father who is a police officer and he just told me that she has to call Access, and that I should expect the worst to happen. She went back to his place last night and my father is saying she will more thank likely tell him where we live and if he's threatening with self harm to have come back then he'll probably do the same with figuring out where we live.

"I recently started going to a therapist and he's been trying to get me to say what I feel, express emotions and think more about myself. I have always had extreme trouble with these things, to the point where I don't even know what emotions I'm feeling because I've always hid them instead.

It started with me being late to my new job. I'm 17 and it's my first ""real"" job so it's a big deal for me. I realised on the bus that I was going to be late, so I called my mom for advice. She flipped, but came to the rescue. During the ride she was yelling to me about how irresponsible I was (which is true). I had a panic attack, because I felt like such a failure and a burden to everyone. She told me to stop (you can't just stop a panic attack) until I yelled at her she was making it worse. After many attempts I could almost control my breathing again but I could tell she got hurt and I feel so bad about yelling at her. 

Another day I was on my way to work again and she told me to clean my room. I understood it as cleaning my room but she meant just picking up clothes or something. She had been in my room picking at stuff that morning and I asked her to stop. Since I was asleep 2 minutes ago I wasn't very patient so when she refused I raised my voice and told her to get out (very unnecessary). She texted me while she was downstairs that if I didn't clean, she would. I don't have anything to hide in my room, but she knows that I hate when she is in my room. 

I told her then and there that I would not come to hers next week if she would threaten me like that. She told me she would drive me to my dad's directly after work.

When we were in the car she asked if I could ""explain my little tantrum"". I told her my perspective and she said I ""painted her as a villan but if that's what I wanted then go ahead"". I don't really remember what she said because I tend to shut down when people yell at me but at some point she said I was selfish because I ""demanded"" that she would drive me to my dad's. I pointed out that I was on my way to the bus when she called and didn't say a word about her driving me, she asked if I was going to go to my dad's without my meds (epilepsy). I said ""yes, so I could avoid this situation"". Very *teen angst ugh I hate my parents* attitude but it's really what I was thinking. She stopped at a bus stop and told me I could get out if I wanted to. So I did.

A day or so later she texted me and asked if I was still mad at her, and I answered back, ""have you been in my room?"". She didn't answer.

My brother(20) has apparently also decided that he won't be going to my mom's this week for basically the same reason, and I feel like an asshat. I feel like I maybe over reacted with the ""threat"" but it just feels so violating in a weird way.

Last year, me, my boyfriend (Jay) and my friend (Kay) agreed to move in together. Kay is a relatively unstable guy, but a friendly guy, you know? He's very neat and clean, seems like he'd keep to himself. Plus, we have known him for a while. Kay was living with his parents, and he desperately was trying to find an escape. But the kid had no concept of money management. He would blow hundreds of dollars on stuff he didn't need and then complain about not having money.

Fast forward to January, when we all committed that by August we would get a place together. In December, he moved out of his parents' house and move into his sister's house. He hated it there, but he made do. I got him a job where he works at currently. He doesn't have to pay rent at his sister's house, he just had to pay for his car and his phone, both of which totaling around $400 a month. He was bringing in around $1800.

So we're coming down to crunch time. It's May, and I graduated from college. Me and Jay (boyfriend) were starting to feel hesitant about the whole thing, because it seemed like more and more that things were getting a little... weird. He was already making rules for the house that we hadn't moved into yet. He wanted to make sure the walls were soundproof for when he would eventually start to date (he's never had a partner before). He was selling all of his stuff, but didn't really talk to us about it.

I sat down with Kay and came up with a budget with him so he could see what he needed to save and spend. He's new to this whole thing so I wanted to make his transition into being an adult who pays bills an easy one.

A week ago, we toured a house together and liked it. The downpayment for deposit, pet deposit and first month's rent was about $3600 (1200 a piece). Me and Jay were fine with doing that, Kay said he was fine with it, too. That place ultimately didn't work out.

Today, Kay tells me and Jay that there's an error with his bank. He starts freaking out, saying that he doesn't want to ""lose everything he has."" He says there was a random $200 charge on his card. Immediate red flag. Jay asks him what he means and Kay said that he only has $300 left in his account. Mind y'all, we were supposed to be signing that lease, and he said he would be down to pay the $1,200 out of pocket. Had we signed the lease, this money would have been due next week. Kay would have signed the lease, knowing that he wouldn't have enough money to pay for it.

The red flags were clear and in abundance, but Jay and I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. But knowing that he never saved up any money, despite his expenses being so low and his income being comparatively higher, was a massive kick in the face. Me and Jay are going to tell Kay that we're backing out, and that we can't live with him. There was no communication and it feels like we were actively deceived. I feel guilty about this, though.

However, before she moved back she discussed it with me and I specifically said I don’t care if you do but do not park in my parking spot (our driveway is set up weird) because I have been parking there for the last 4 years and it has been my spot since then, and when I told her this she said okay. However recently she has been parking in my spot constantly and it causes me a difficult time to get out in the morning (I leave a lot earlier than her) and it causes me to have to walk a lot further to get to my car. On top of that she lets her boyfriend sleep over (my parents don’t like it) which adds another car to the already mixed up parking situation, since she has moved back it has been 6 cars trying to park instead of 4.

"My bf (23 M) and I (21 F) have been in a long committed relationship and we have been sexually actively for awhile. I’ve been using birth control for 6 years now and have never had a problem - until one day I found out I was pregnant. Since we’re both college students living paycheck to paycheck and have no desire to have kids we both agreed upon an abortion. I’m a closet atheist but my parents are extremely catholic. They are very pro-life and believe in no sex until marriage so this was obviously something I wanted kept secret from them. Before the date of the procedure I called my medical provider to see what I needed to do in order to keep the procedure and all it’s payments confidential since I’m still under my moms insurance. They set up what was basically a secret billing account so that any of the billing from the procedure would be sent to me instead of my mom. They told me all I need to do was tell the lady at the front desk that I need everything confidential and she’ll know what to do. So on the day of the procedure I did exactly that, the lady at the front desk told me if anyone asks if I was here today she would not be able to give them any info, and all the billing would go to me. 
Fast forward a month later and I get a call from my mom who’s in hysterics. Not only did she get the bill from the hospital, she called the surgery center and they told her I was there for an abortion. I probably knocked my poor mom into another dimension because she didn’t even know I was having sex. It took a huge toll on our relationship. 
I called my medical provider and I was livid. They apologized and filed a complaint and they found out that the lady at the front desk did not end up sending the bill to that secret account made for me and instead sent it to my mom’s. 
Obviously I’m furious because I was very clear with her. So when the case manager called and asked if there was anyway I could be compensated I told her I wanted someone fired. She asked if I was serious and I said of course. Both the lady at the front desk and whoever told my mom I had an abortion did not do their job and I’m pretty sure it violates HIPPA. I don’t know if me demanding they get fired is enough to actually get them fired but based on the conversation I had with the case manager it seemed likely. My bf thinks I’m being too harsh but they’re the ones who made a careless decision. Some girls get kicked out of their homes because their parents find out they’ve gotten an abortion!

I went to a block party with a girl I have known for about two years, but have only been getting close with for three weeks. She's nice, but kind of naive and a little judgemental at the same time. We're both 25 years old. She's confided a lot with me, and I've never passed judgement on her. Anyways, I have been in a long term relationship with a man who she also knows.

(He is very private and only posts pictures of his dog and nature scenes.) Anyways this week I had missed my period and had gotten a negative test, but just to be cautious incase I was pregnant, I decided not to drink or do anything that would be harmful to a pregnancy until I could take another test and know for sure. She questioned me as to why I wasn't drinking and I asked her to keep it between us, but I told her I was worried I might be pregnant and was taking precautions. She was furious with me and told me we were both adults and that she's not even in a long term relationship and she's on birth control. I told her that we use condoms and other methods of birth control, but that the symptoms were too unhealthy for me, and that I also have an increased risk of blood clots. She lectured me and told me she was highly judging me. It made me feel really bad, but I also felt like it's not her business whether I am on birth control or not, and why my boyfriend does not post pictures of us online.

byro67	2019-06-10 01:15:25	Owl_Hurricane	AITA for refusing to help my highly ill mother when she is constantly guilt-tripping me?	"My mom has a plethora of health issues - it started about 14 years ago when she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. She has a cane now and is turning 60 this year. Recently, she was hospitalized for some mysterious bacteria that turns out that has a 50/50 chance of being cancerous or leukemia, or something else. She doesn’t work and is on social security.

She will sometimes do something out of the blue that’s genuinely kind. And then sometimes she will do things that are blatantly selfish, like forcing me to include all her college friends in my wedding. She makes a mountain out of a molehill, and EVERYTHING she asks me to do is premised with guilt-tripping or “why” I should. Here’s a few very recent examples:

1. One sis had a couch to move. My mom calls me and “begs” me and my hubby to help move it b/c my dad did something with his back and couldn’t do it. We agree, and show up much to my sister’s surprise. Turns out 5 people showed up to move one loveseat couch.
2. Cousin had a musical he was in. Mom asks if we can go, but then in the same message she adds “Thought it might be nice if you go. [name] supported you in your performances”

Now here’s the most recent thing that prompted me to post. My mom scheduled a dog groomer appointment knowing full well that it would be during the time my cousins were in from Cali. Then plans were made to attend a baseball game. She BEGS my sisters and I to take the dog to the groomer b/c “his fur was getting matted.” It wasn’t that bad - the dog would be perfectly fine for another week. One sis responds saying “we’ll figure it out between the three of us” without my input. Guess who gets stuck with it? Me. Because I’m the only sister without kids and it’s the “most logical thing” according to said sister. I agreed to do it because god forbid I refuse that. I was very unhappy about it because we ourselves had been busy all week, working overtime, and busted our asses helping my parents clean the day before. On top of all of it, the cousins were supposed to come over the next day to our home. We still had to clean our place and was counting on this day to clean and finally get a chance to relax. I was upset and questioned my mom on the fact that she let this happen in the first place. She got furious because she “always bends her schedule to us” and “never begs us to do anything.” Right before she leaves, she apologizes for the way she reacted, but gave all these reasons why it was justified and never once tried to empathize with me or admit she made a mistake with the groomer appointment.

Oh and here’s the kicker: my mom plays it up as no biggie and a “small favor” because she said it would be just an hour - it was two and a half hours.

So here I am: sick of her shit, but feeling like an asshole if I don’t do as she asks. I feel like I’m being played in a mind game and I don’t know when or where to draw the line."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
byrny3	2019-06-10 01:14:46		AITA for refusing to go to my mom's house?	"I recently started going to a therapist and he's been trying to get me to say what I feel, express emotions and think more about myself. I have always had extreme trouble with these things, to the point where I don't even know what emotions I'm feeling because I've always hid them instead.

It started with me being late to my new job. I'm 17 and it's my first ""real"" job so it's a big deal for me. I realised on the bus that I was going to be late, so I called my mom for advice. She flipped, but came to the rescue. During the ride she was yelling to me about how irresponsible I was (which is true). I had a panic attack, because I felt like such a failure and a burden to everyone. She told me to stop (you can't just stop a panic attack) until I yelled at her she was making it worse. After many attempts I could almost control my breathing again but I could tell she got hurt and I feel so bad about yelling at her. 

Another day I was on my way to work again and she told me to clean my room. I understood it as cleaning my room but she meant just picking up clothes or something. She had been in my room picking at stuff that morning and I asked her to stop. Since I was asleep 2 minutes ago I wasn't very patient so when she refused I raised my voice and told her to get out (very unnecessary). She texted me while she was downstairs that if I didn't clean, she would. I don't have anything to hide in my room, but she knows that I hate when she is in my room. 

I told her then and there that I would not come to hers next week if she would threaten me like that. She told me she would drive me to my dad's directly after work.

When we were in the car she asked if I could ""explain my little tantrum"". I told her my perspective and she said I ""painted her as a villan but if that's what I wanted then go ahead"". I don't really remember what she said because I tend to shut down when people yell at me but at some point she said I was selfish because I ""demanded"" that she would drive me to my dad's. I pointed out that I was on my way to the bus when she called and didn't say a word about her driving me, she asked if I was going to go to my dad's without my meds (epilepsy). I said ""yes, so I could avoid this situation"". Very *teen angst ugh I hate my parents* attitude but it's really what I was thinking. She stopped at a bus stop and told me I could get out if I wanted to. So I did.

A day or so later she texted me and asked if I was still mad at her, and I answered back, ""have you been in my room?"". She didn't answer.

My brother(20) has apparently also decided that he won't be going to my mom's this week for basically the same reason, and I feel like an asshat. I feel like I maybe over reacted with the ""threat"" but it just feels so violating in a weird way. 

 I just can't help but think my mom is sad and whatever and I feel like the worst child ever. I  sure do feel like an Asshole but my father says otherwise. What do you say, reddit? AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

To be fair he was on holiday but ghosting me after sleeping together really hurt my feelings. I broke things off. 

I decided to give him another chance as he apologised. Yesterday he asked if I would be interested in seeing him again before he moves away sometime this week. I said ok and I gave him the free time I had as he had asked. He first said yes the day worked, but then hours later he told me actually he wasn’t free that day and he would have to see. Immediately it made me defensive considering the way he had acted previously. I told him to be honest about if he wasn’t interested in seeing me again. I got a bit pissed and told him that he was irritating me and I wanted to cancel it. He said it was a good idea. 

He made out as though I was angry about the fact he was taking a while to respond to me rather than the fact he was acting badly again.

byrlym	2019-06-10 01:09:05	Jesshu07	AITA for not wanting to be around MIL	"I never had a problem with my MIL before my son was born. I knew she was overbearing and a bit crazy, but I was never really around her.

Prior to baby, we only hung around his family for special occasions. And even then, we always made plans afterwards so we would have an excuse to leave early. My H can only take his parents (his mom) in short doses.

Fast forward to 2 years ago when LO was born. Everything changed. MIL couldnt make the transition from parent to grandparent. She made it clear that LO was HER baby and that she was going to do whatever she wanted.

she crossed all my boundaries. She did not care what I wanted for my child. I would tell her not to do something and she would do it behind my back. She even went so far as to lie about it. I would ask her to her face and she would lie repeatedly.

Over time I started to hate her. The mention of her name would send me into a panic attack. I cant even tell you the number of times I've cried over something she did. I wanted to parent my child, but she made me feel less than and that I was inferior to her authority.

She has no respect for us. She has said that whatever my H tells her goes in one ear and out the other. In the past he has attempted to talk to her about what bothers me but she doesnt care.

When LO was about 5 months old, I reached a breaking point. I felt physically ill and mentally drained. I know MIL will always be a part of my life because she will always be a part of LO's life. Because of that, I seeked out therapy.

And I'm doing so much better. I still cant stand MIL but I no longer cry. She has not changed but I have learned how to deal with it better.

A part of why I no longer feel horrible is because I distance myself from her. Outside of special occassions, I opt out of activities. If I'm not around her then I dont feel bad. Being around her causes anxiety...which my H knows.

 It bothers my H that I dont wabt to hang out with his mom. He doesnt like that I dont want to eat lunch with her on a random Saturday. Or that I don't want to invite her to the park with us. To him, his parents are family and even though I dont like his mom, he thinks I should suck it up and still hang out with her.

I dont keep LO from MIL. I tell my H that hes more than welcome to have lunch with his mom and LO. I jsut dont want to be there. Am I the asshoke for not sucking it up?

I'm always polite and kind when I see her. But it takes alot out of me. Especially when shes all over LO and ignores my instructions."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
byrlvk	2019-06-10 01:08:50	bassistface199x99LvL	AITA during this encounter today with some guy who wanted to buy a cigarette off of me?	"Okay so I was going about my Sunday. Everything started off normal. Got up, played bass at my church, then decided to go get some pizza today for some family to bring home for lunch.

 This pizzeria I frequent once in awhile is attached to a gas station. I've never had any confrontations with anyone there before. 

As I am leaving the pizzeria, I get approached by this guy, heavier set, probably early 30s, looked a bit rough. 

He asks me ""Hey man can I buy a cigarette off of you for my girlfriend?""

I reply back ""I don't smoke cigarettes, sorry""

He walks away and begins to start mumbling under his breath something about the people around here and it was just odd.. 

So I looked over at him and when he got back to his car near the pump, he looks back and saw me stating at him. 

Then he says something like:

""Get back in your fucking car! Pussy!""

Me: *Looks over at him like I'm looking at someone with three heads* 

Him: ""Do something!"" 

Me: ""What's your problem? I told you I don't smoke cigarettes!""

Him: ""It's your fucking attitude! Get back in your car!"" Yadda yadda.

I'm not one who likes confrontations. Especially nowadays just seeing how crazy some people can be. 

So I  responded with a good ol' ""Go fuck yourself!"" And I got in my car and left..

Now I knew I didn't give this guy any attitude. I had a handful of pizza, wings, and a two liter of soda, and all I said was I don't smoke cigarettes..

Driving home I thought to myself.. 

Dude your at a gas station! You can go buy a pack of Traffic's for like $3 down here in the south! 

I didn't know what this guy's problem was.. Drugs maybe? I'm just glad there was some distance between us because like I stated, I'm not one for confrontations.. I just want to go about my day.

byrlow	2019-06-10 01:08:16	Blue_Morning	AITA for not wanting to take my father's amazing offer.	"Little background here. My father and mother divorced when I was young but always had a good relationship with him. Visited every summer and some holidays, really nice guy just things didn't work out for him and my mum. 

 Anyways he moved across the country and so after highschool my mum and him wanted me to move in with my father to get out of town and try something new. I didn't want to, since now I felt I could finally work on my life and not having to really be forced to go out there. But I went for about 6 months, didn't really like it out there, he works a lot so hardly ever even saw him. Had a family death so flew back to my mums and asked if I could move back home. My mum and dad both said sure to moving back. That was about 4 years ago. I'm 23 now.

Fast-forward to now. Evey conversation I have with my father since then is always about me moving back, I've told him that currently in my life I don't want to move back out there and that I'm planning on moving up state on my own to do my own thing.

He offers me that I could move in with him rent free, ( he lives in a real nice house, pool, boat, practically on the beach.).He has friends that are willing to help me with getting a job in the field that got my degree in. I told him that I appreciate the offer but I want to try and go do my own thing for once, since I've been living with a parent all my life. They keep saying that I'm throwing this opportunity away and being rude to turn it down. I know that the opportunity is amazing and people would be extremely grateful for it, I am that he's offering it. But I feel that where I'm at in my life right now is that I don't want to end up living with a parent for any longer than I need to right now. I want to try and make it on my own even if it isn't the smartest financial decision. I feel like I need to do this for me and to finally try and be independent.

byrl9q	2019-06-10 01:07:05	therapperboolio	AITA for interfering in my friend’s relationship?	"Some context: I (21 M) have these two friends from school (21 M and 19 F) who started dating about a year ago now. The guy is a fraternity brother of mine and the girl is one of my closest friends. When they first started talking they would hang out but weren’t dating, and one day he had sex with one of her good friends, so the relationship got off to a rocky start when they started dating a month or so later.

They would fight about everything, she would talk to me more than him if we were in a big group and he didn’t like that. She didn’t like a lot of his lifestyle choices like his reliance on substances and she would hold the fact that he slept with this girl over his head all the time, even though he and her were now good friends.

So for the first half of the relationship things were fine for the most part. Any problems they had were solved pretty easily with sex. But over time he started avoiding a lot of the girls that we were all friends with and we learned that it was because the gf didn’t like them. I’m no expert but that seems pretty abusive.

I took a semester off, and when I came back she was studying abroad. When I come back everyone is complaining about their relationship, including the bf. When they started dating she was a virgin and he had a pretty significant sexual past, which also caused a tension in the relationship. 

To remedy this problem, she was allowed to sleep around while she was abroad, but he wasn’t allowed to do anything. This is something they both agreed upon.

Before she left she he made him quit smoking weed and chewing tobacco, as soon as she left he was doing both all the time. She would get mad at him for things that weren’t his fault and he seemed to become less and less happy by the day.

A few times he would talk to me about and say something like “I don’t see a myself marrying her” while she was saying that she very much planned on marrying him. I thought that was kinda shitty and he had expressed to me quite a few times that she was crazy and that women suck the life out of him.

They both kept involving me in their disputes and then would both get mad at me for telling the other what had happened. I had had enough and told the girl that he had no intention of marrying her. They broke up for a day and got back together. The guy didn’t speak to me for a few days and the girl blocked my number for a few days. 

One night I’m at the bar and this girl invites me back to her dorm room. I go back with her and we start taking and she mentions that she and the bf hooked up the previous weekend. 

I exposed him for cheating. He currently hates me and talks behind my back to all of our brothers and mutual friends.

AITA for interfering? I had asked multiple people for advice and they all seemed to think it seemed toxic and something needed to happen. 

This was also the second time he’d cheated and I kept my mouth shut the first time, I had to fess up. Was it not my place? Should I have avoided it?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
byrl6x	2019-06-10 01:06:51	kawaiidonut_suit	WIBTA for cancelling all future trips with my mother?	"Sorry this is gonna be kind of long so buckle up.

So basically: awhile ago my mother made the decision to cheat on my step dad (who I absolutely do not get along with most of the time) and has recently told him everything due to the man she was seeing suddenly breaking it off with her. She had told me (17 f) about it while it was going on btw, which added to a lot of stress I was already under. 

She had been lying almost constantly about where she was, even to me, and when she confessed I thought it was over and the lying would stop and I could start to trust her again.

Cut to this weekend, we had scheduled a camping trip with her, myself, my two younger siblings, my girlfriend, and our mutual friend. We got there last night and it was really fun, all were having a great time. Then this morning, I woke up and texted her about breakfast, and she said to just help ourselves to the yogurt and muffins we brought. She also said that she had left to go help my grandma with something and to occupy ourselves until she gets back, okay, fine, whatever, nbd.

She was gone for SIX FUCKING HOURS. She comes back later and I was understanding at first, then I asked what it was that my grandma needed help with and she said she wasn't at grandma's. She said ""I needed to go try and fix something, but it couldn't be fixed. I spent five hours driving there but it was for nothing."" 

And I was *furious*. Not only had she lied to me about where she was, but she had ruined the plans for the day as we had planned on going fishing at a nearby lake all day (and she had taken the only car). By the time we had left it was like five and I'm currently sitting here an hour later seething because of all that wasted time and potential. 

The reason I want to cancel all future trips with her (and probably eventually cut her out of my life once I move out) is because when I told her I cannot trust her anymore, she just said ""The feeling is mutual."" To which I don't even know what she was talking about. Later in the car when I was brooding, she told me ""I'm a big girl. I don't need your approval. I have needs and I went to take care of them."" And I told her I was mad she just left us there during what was supposed to be some much needed family time doing my favorite summer activity. 

I feel extremely betrayed and like she prioritized the person she went to see (the man she had only known for maybe a month, whom she was cheating with) over me and and the rest of her family. She thinks I'm overreacting and that I don't deserve to be mad because she is ""just taking care of her needs."" WIBTA for cutting her out??"	Not the A-hole	0	0	18.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

SO! My sister’s baby is my parent’s only grandchild. And my sister tried so hard & for so long to get pregnant (3 miscarriages) that when her first Mother’s Day came up I got her a necklace with the baby’s name engraved on it. I’ll probably never buy her another Mother’s Day gift again, most likely cards from here on out.    

Her husband already has a child, who is 15 & I’m relatively close to the kid. We play yahtzee, the game of life, monopoly, BoTW, read comic books, love the same movies, etc. I don’t see why I would get BIL a gift for Father’s Day when I’ve always just given him a card? And it kinda seems like an insult to his teenager that I’m just now acknowledging him being a parent as opposed to all the years before the baby was born.    

I told my parents & husband that I didn’t intend to buy BIL a gift but my parents have already picked out something awesome he’ll love (something to do with billiards? I don’t really know) and my husband says I should acknowledge BIL beyond just his usual card.

His fiancé is dreadful. 

She’s unbelievably rude. She gets really sarcastic and mean with waiters when we all have gone out to eat, talks over people, and drives like a bat out of Hell with no regard for others.

She’s incredibly controlling. She literally takes Stephens phone during certain times because it’s “not appropriate he use it then” and he “needs to learn self control”.

She has openly told me the things my wife and I do they won’t do because she doesn’t think it’s healthy.

I care a ton about Stephen and I know it’s not my place to make this decision for him. I NEVER give people warning about their SO’s because that’s in “fuck off” territory for me. But marriage is different and I want Stephen to be happy.

Our entire friend group is essentially married except for him and he regularly said he feels left out. He had a major death happen super recently and I think this may be how he is coping.

Girlfriends friend works as manager in the building she lives in, potentially getting kicked out after an altercation with another tenant. And the 2nd thing is that my GF just failed her final year of her degree, and opened up about her poor mental health and is now on anti depressants.

So at the moment she is living in a lovely building with great studio apartments, no issues whatsoever. In the city we live in it is probably the best apartments you can get for students, the rest are full of first years just looking to drink and party, gross roommates, shitty maintenance etc.

In a phone call the other day she tells me she will potentially be moving to a different building if her friend gets kicked out, to which I reply (I should've put this more nicely) ""well no you're not, youre not gonna end up in some shitty building for your 3rd year RETAKE, just because you wanna live with your friend"".

She keeps putting clean clothes on it, even if I tell her not to.

Today I came home after an hour of riding it, and I didn't clean it. Just 10 minutes passed, after I went to my room and cleaned myself, and then I saw it was full of underwear. I told her, for the 50th time, to not put clothes on it. 

She started saying that I'm a weirdo, that she doesn't understand why I tell her that, that I have an obsession, that it isn't normal for me to think like that, and that the bike is just a bunch of pipes. 

We ended up having an argue. I ran out of arguments to make her understand, and I don't really know if I'm being obsessive about it, or maybe I should let it go and try to ignore it.

About a couple miles later I notice there's about 6-7 cars behind me all in my same situation (they wanna go faster but can't because of Mr. Daydreamer in front of me). Meanwhile there's cars in the middle and right lanes going the same speed as our guy in front of me. Left lane driver seems oblivious to the situation he's causing. This is where I get my idea and once I get an opportunity to overtake him I get back into the left lane and slow down (not slam on my brakes or anything crazy) by letting go of the accelerator until he is basically forced to slow down and tail gate me. I do this until he moves out of the left lane. I didn't really block traffic as the middle and right lanes were moving faster than us bc of me so cars just kept passing us. So by giving him a taste of his own medicine does that make me the asshole? I was just annoyed since drivers zone out while driving and camp out in the passing lane and just stay there regardless of how many people seem to pass them up.	Asshole	0	0	157.0	32.0	0.0	0.0

byrg19	2019-06-10 00:51:40	kaleab400	AITA or WIBTA. Blocked by best friend for talking to her boyfriend	"Backstory: I had a friend and we were the closest of friends. I had a crush on her and asked her out multiple times, and she had said no to all times 5-6 except for one. We dated for a week and half because I found out she liked someone through Roblox(I'm not kidding).
We will name best friend gf. 
Anyways it's been a year and she's dating a different guy and we still talk we were good friends until she blocked me. She told me not to talk to her boyfriend because she was afraid something bad was going to happen. She also told me he was the jealous type. The only reason I talked to him was because I wanted to be friends with him. Later the boyfriend posted on his story ""ask me 3 questions"". I ask two them being ""Are you the jealous type"" and "" how did you and gf meet"". He then replies no and we met in math. I let him know I am a weird guy and he says he is one too. I tell him we have two thing in common. One being that we are weird and we dated the girl. He then starts saying that we never dated and she doesnt remember that and she doesnt like me. I thought he was lying and started cursing him out because I didn't believe him. He starts threatening me saying if I try to talk to her he will do something to me and that he is with her. I screenshot the part where he says she doesn't remember anything. He asks why the screenshot and I let him know that I felt creeped out by him. The next day I find out that I'm blocked by both of them on Snapchat. I then realize that they both go on each other's accounts. So I thought the boyfriend had blocked me on her and his account. I let my older sister know what's going on and they are on my side and say I should wait the weekend over to let things calm down. I ask my other best friend and the gf's best friend and they say I did nothing wrong. I wait the weekend and text her through my number. I ask how's her summer and if she blocked me. She then tells me that she blocked me and doesn't remember that we dated. I tried to remember but then she gives me a sarcastic answer saying she doesn't remember. I beg her to forgive me and I don't get a reply back. I feel I am in the right even though I didnt listen to her. I plan to apologize in person and give her a gift. I really don't want to lose her as a best friend. She like a little sister to me. So the question is AITA?

TL;DR: My best friend and I dated for a short time .A year later  We were best friends and we catch up. I talk to her boyfriend and I get blocked by boyfriend and best friend. I find out that she had blocked me and is upset I talked to boyfriend and doesn't remember us dating. I apologized and begged to her forgive me and I plan to apologize in person with a gift. I don't want to lose her as a friend."	Asshole	0	0	364.0	29.0	0.0	0.0

"So a couple months ago I got my partner a binder because they where having severe dysphoria on the days they identified as a male, since they where born a female. In order to cope with this I got them a chest binder, and after explaining the dangers (I did do my research and talked to a doctor about it) and how long they can wear it, etc. I gave it to them. I also got one for a friend, explaining the same thing I did to my SO. Let’s call them Trey. It went good for about 3 months, but last night I was hanging over at Treys house, their mum noticed how their chest looked flatter than usual. I managed to redirect the conversation and we went to bed after binge watching an anime. I’m just gonna throw this in now, we are both 16 so nothing happened. We woke up in the morning and went downstairs, and they put on their binder again because they only had it on for 2 hours yesterday. Their mum suddenly said “your chest looks way to flat, come here” and dragged them into the bathroom. And then proceeded to yell at them for 10 minutes about how they are a girl and their daughter and how they don’t know what they want to do with their life because they are only 16. And how they are not trans because “you used to wear dresses when you where younger” I feel like I’m the asshole. Their mum drove me home after and I heard from Trey when I got out of the car that they got yelled at really badly. I feel like a complete asshole. I was just trying to do the right thing but I think I messed up really bad. AITA?

*Being a straight person during pride month is like living in Nazi Germany*

It's true. A sympathetic gay couple have sheltered me in their attic for the last 5 days. The gaystapo came yesterday and interrogated my benefactors, but they didn't search the house. At least not this time.

I'm putting them in terrible danger, but I don't know what else to do. I know what happens to those who protect breeders. They know it too. How long will the be willing to risk their lives for me? I trust them; I have to. What happens when the closet police come back, though? What happens when they are forced to choose between their safety and mine? I pray it doesn't come to that.

A crowd was marching in the street today. I could hear then chanting ""YASS QUEEN, YASS QUEEN"" through the walls of my hiding place. I can't tell if it's the stomp of their thigh high boots or my own shaking, but it feels like an earthquake. An earthquake inside my own head... my god, there's so many of them. I need to stay positive, but I can feel the spidery thread of hope slipping through my fingers.

byra0i	2019-06-10 00:33:36		WIBTA if I invested in a house with my mother instead of my girlfriend	"So my mother and I have been living in a rented house since I was 4, after her and my father split up due to his alcoholism. During the divorce proceedings she had the opportunity to own the house her and my father shared, but she chose to let him live in it, as she didn’t want my father to be a potentially homeless alcoholic. We ended up finding a cheap rental property and we’ve lived there ever since.

My father died 10 years ago, and he had such a huge credit card debt we had to sell the house to pay that off, and I ended up with the remainder (~£40,000). Last year my grandmother (mums mother) died, and her house was gifted to my cousin + her husband, they lived there rent-free for a year until they could afford to buy the house, and they just bought it this week, so my mother has had her share (again, ~£40,000).

Now my mother is 59, and I personally dont want her to be renting a house for the unforseeable future, so I suggested me and her pool our savings together and put down a deposit on a house, which would be under both our names.

This is where my girlfriend comes in.

Her mother owns 3 properties, she lives in one, my girlfriends grandmother lives in another rent free, and the third property is currently empty. I mentioned to my girlfriend about possibly buying a house with my mother, and she got a bit off with me; and said “well what about us?” She has around £3000 saved up, which pooled together isn’t anywhere near a deposit for a house.

I feel like I’m the asshole for suggesting I buy a house with my mother instead of her, but there’s a part of me which is screaming “you are not the asshole for looking after your mother.” The two of them have had some friction in the past, neither of them have been angels, but my mother will always be my mother, and I’m aware of how much she has sacrificed for both my father and myself.

&#x200B;

My friends and I went to a gallery opening together this passed weekend. Throughout the night an older man kept stopping and taking pictures of me. At first he was obvious about it, and I didn't mind because he was taking pictures of everybody. They were candid pictures, so he was not asking anyone if he could take their picture, including me. Over the night I kept noticing him stopping to take pictures of everyone else, and he was only focusing on me. Then he went from stopping and obviously taking pictures, to taking pictures very sneakily, and only of me. It made me very uncomfortable. He was holding his camera low and looking at the screen and very coyly hitting the shutter button. It was really weird and I alerted my friends, but they just sort of laughed it off. They said he was just a harmless old man and he probably just thought I was cute. I was very uncomfortable at this point and he continued to take photos of me. We were sitting a long table next to an older woman and some other people. The man came to sit down by the older woman who seemed to know him (maybe his wife, sister, idk?) He slid his camera under the table and I felt like he was either trying to take pictures of my legs or trying to get an upskirt. I saw him turn his camera on, and again subtly point it to me under the table. I stood up and asked him what he was taking pictures of. He seemed really frazzled and said nothing. I asked him if I could see the last few photos on his camera and he told me sure and then pretended like the battery had died. I got up and left. My friends came and told me he was the artist's father and that I was being an asshole for making a scene. I told  them that I saw him taking pictures of me and I was protecting myself from him taking borderline sexual photos of my legs or up my skirt. They lectured me on how I was acting like a child, and I need to grow up and know that he was an old man and I should have been more sensitive. So... am I the asshole?"

"My mother, I love her great Mom, but we were going out party of 15, we were at her house prior to going out to a chain restaurant and she had a cake she wanted to bring to the restaurant. I said you can't take your own cake to a restaurant that sells desserts. 

My argument, that I told her was that it puts the server in a bad position since most likely it's against the chain restaurants rules, their manager might tell them to cut it off, then they in turn feel like an asshole for having to tell us we can't bring outside food in and then feeling like they are risking their tip, and I think my mother would get upset as well. Just mad inside you know like a Mom.

She didn't agree, she left the cake we returned after the restaurant and we all ate. My nephew lives closer to the restaurant he didn't want to drive all the way back but still it's just you can't bring outside food is my position only because I think it sucks for the server or a family owned place I definitely say no. 

My Mom was angry at my position. AITA?

Edit: Never knew of a cake cutting fee, just seemed crazy to bring in outside food to a restaurant to me. Kind of like a slippery slope, I don't like Pepsi so I brought a 2 liter of Coke for the party.

"My father passed away in a freak accident at work this passed October 18th 2018 and it was devastating as no one from my mother's side nor my father's side has ever dealt with death so close to home.  My mother and father divorced but they loved each other still due to of having kids with each other.  Since my dad's 45th birthday is coming up I asked my mom a few days in advance to go visit him at his grave and go eat at the last restaurant I ate with him. So here comes the birthday June 9th, and I'm in my room and i hear my mom with a few friends and Im sitting in room confused thinking why are we bring random people I don't like that. Due to being more of a private matter. Eventually I hear my mom open the door to my other young sibling's rooms and saying goodbye be back later but not to me. As soon as they leave I ask my siblings where did mom go? Little brother said she left the house with some friends. I immediately get super red and angry as it was a day planned to commemorate my dad. I texted my mother this

Text 1: You know it's dads 45th birthday right, we were supposed to go to his grave and atotonicos and yet you're out with your friends.  I'm kinda super upset. And I asked you days before hand and you said we'll go.  Smh

Text2: Oh and don't use the ol' reliable saying ""I just forgot"" or if you didn't forget it's even worse because you chose to be with your buddies instead of spending a day of just commemorating dad.  Only way I'd let this slide if your friends were dying from an insufferable disease or cancer you were just spending time with them, other than that its inexcusable.

Im just super sad I wanted to spend this day doing those things but it won't happen today. But ATIA? Did I overreact?

When I got home I asked her about this and she told me he was lost. I knew it was bullshit and pressed harder on it. She revealed she sent him to an adoption agency. We yelled at each other for about 10 minutes, before she slapped me after i told her she was being a massive cunt. I wasn't thinking and slapped her twice, then made her leave.

Not the closest friends but we had a few beers late and enjoyed watching a movie now and then but I was very busy with my new girlfriend so not time for my housemate but we could call each other good friends. 6 months ago his brother came and lived on our couch for three months after a bad break up. I felt bad for him and even helped him look for a job in the area. Didn't ask for a penny off the guy for bills or petty rent for alway being at our home.

&#x200B;

Now he has GF and they decide to move in slowly without asking me. She contributed nothing to the bills and again I let it slide since we were on good terms and she always goes out her way to be nice to me. They ask me one night if its cool if they can take the apartment to themselves. I said no but I would think about it. Had a chat with my GF and we decided it was time for us to move in together too so housemate could take the house in the end.

&#x200B;

I get the new apartment signed for, deposit paid and even help my housemates girl move in, lugging baggage and driving across town. Finally time for me to move and everything is packed but then there is a delay of a month due to emergency renovation work (burst sewage pipe). I was given my first month rent back but since my girlfriend can't contribute to the deposit I had to pay it all. I have handed in my notice at this point and moving out date was officially 1st May. My girlfriend suggests we go on holiday for 2 weeks to her parents place and then move to the new apartment. Unfortunately her parents invited us for 15th may til 1st June. So for 2 weeks I officially have no where to live.

&#x200B;

I explain the situation to my housemate and his girl and ask to stay as a guest for 2 weeks but to my surprise he just flat out says ""yeah so you owe us half a months rent and bills so you can stay otherwise its best to move today"". Not sure why this hurt so much when he said it but even his girlfriend was surprised since they had planned to turn my bedroom into a guest bedroom/storage room anyway. The girlfriend tried to offer resolve things but I just took my stuff and left for a local storage facility. Stayed with my GF until we went on vacation. Haven't spoken to him since. His girlfriend messaged me asking how the move went and if we were okay at our new place. I didn't reply.

Here's the situation:

Let's assume there's a two lane highway.  The right lane is travelling at 60, but I want to go 70, so I get over to pass a long line of cars.  Then, someone who wants to go 80 flies up behind me in the middle of my pass.

I feel like since I am passing people, I'm using the lane correctly regardless of how fast the people behind me want to go.  Plus, slowing down and getting back in the right lane behind people going slower than me is more dangerous and will just piss everyone off more.

So I have been with my husband for 2 1/2 years and we literally just got married a few weeks ago. When we were on our honeymoon, which we agreed was the best time of our lives, my husband accidentally spent all of our money via a withdraw he forgot about and so when we got back he had $0 and was super stressed. I had a few dollars so I paid our bills and got us food and gas and was ready to wait till payday. 

Hubby starts being distant and upset all of the time, not listening to what I’m saying when it’s just us; and one day he says he has “hit rock bottom” which really hurts my feelings because I feel like we still have each other no matter what.

So yesterday we were arguing about something and I got upset and threw the remote at the TV and busted a few pixels in it. I know this was wrong, so I started to walk back to our bedroom to cool off when he grabs me by the shoulders. He has accidentally hurt me before twice now, so my reaction this time was anger (which I see now was wrong) and told him to get out. After he left, I immediately felt bad and wanted him to come back to talk about it. He says he doesn’t want to, so I get angry again (which again is obviously wrong) and literally broke all of the dishes and furniture that was out. Then he goes to his uncles house and says he’s afraid to come back by himself and wants a “mediator” to talk to me. So I go to his uncles house and his uncle keeps saying that it’s my fault, I’m a sinner and need help blah blah, basically didn’t listen to a word I had to say and took hubbys side and contradicted me the entire conversation. So then his uncle tells him to get in his car, we are going to get hubbys things from our apartment and hubby needs a few days to think. Then we get to the apartment, which I follow them into because 1) I had to use the bathroom and 2) I actually had his work suits in my car to give to him in case he did want some time, which I did not originally know about. So I follow them down the stairs and try to call out to him to ask what does he want to do? Does he want to break up or what? Hubby doesnt say a word to me from two flights of stairs below me and get in the car. I was thinking maybe he didn’t hear me so I tried to open the car door to talk to him before they go, but the door was locked. So I step in front of the car with the wait a minute hand symbol and his uncle starts driving forward and pushing me backwards with his car. I got a notification saying that he took me as an authorized user off of our phone account an hour ago and tried to call but he blocked my number.

She lived with several other women in our year, and one of them, Alex, I had been romantically involved with since before I was even friends with Ozzy. I ended it one day, and Ozzy was very supportive of me.
A few months later, Ozzy is having a party at her house (the house she shares with Alex), and the entire week before hand she’s begging me to come. Then the day of, she randomly uninvited me without warning, saying that “Alex told us all she doesn’t want you in the house.” This hurt me for a few reasons, but honestly if she had to chose between me and a roomate, I get her choosing a roomate.
A few days later, I’m talking to one of their other housemates, Grace, who tells me Alex never said I shouldn’t come.
So, at this point I have no clue what to believe.
Unsure of who to trust or how to move forward, I decide I need a little space from Ozzy. Both because I needed to sort out how I felt and what I wanted to do/say about the events that transpired, and because, frankly, I felt so uncomfortable around her. So suddenly, our constant communication just stopped. And it wasn’t just my fault, I didn’t reach out to her and she made no effort to reach out to me. It was pretty much simultaneous.
Two weeks pass, and I realize I need to talk to Ozzy and sort things out. We meet and she immediately starts yelling at me and crying, telling me how bad of a friend I am. She says I made her feel invisible, and that she’s not sure if she can forgive me for that. I try to explain to her the reasons why I needed space, but I’m so caught off guard by the intensity of the moment I can’t form words for half of them. She eventually storms out of the room, leaving me stunned and broken. She then comes back two minutes later, crying, and asks to be friends again. Of course I say yes, and her immediate response is “you need therapy. You need to see a therapist once a week.” She leaves seconds after and tells me to text her if ever need anything or want to talk. I’m alone in the room again, still speechless. Things are fine for a few weeks, but there’s a weird undercurrent to our conversations. But, I tell myself I’m reading too much into it and return the kindness as genuinely as I can. Then, out of nowhere, she drops back. Not completely, but enough. Then my birthday comes around, and she sends me a gift and a very kind card out of nowhere. So her birthday comes around a little later and I send her a card and a small gift. She texts me immediately how much she loves it and how much it means to her. Then we don’t see each other for a few days, until I see her in a recital. I text her afterwards congratulating her, and she responds “Thanks.” 
And then she completely started ignoring me.

I’m thinking about telling her to maybe chill or calm down a bit and stop being rude to people. But I’m worried if I’d lose our friendship, so WIBTA if I told my friend that she’s rude?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We exchanged a few messages on the app before exchanging numbers on Wednesday. He sent me a text and asked me to dinner Sunday evening. He picked the general area and the time. We didn’t select a specific restaurant yet. We sent a few text messages back and forth but nothing too deep. We never had a phone conversation. And the text messages were mainly surface level. He sent a few text messages asking if we were still on for dinner and to “confirm” even though I kept telling him yes. 

So fast forward to today. The guy sends me a text message asking if he can bring his daughter to dinner for our first date. He attached a picture of the girl to the text message. She looked to be about 2 years old. I told him it would be best to reschedule. He seemed upset.

One, I’m not sure what would be kid friendly on a Sunday evening in the area we selected to meet. It is a lot of bars. Two, he doesn’t even know if I’m a real person and he’s sending me selfies of his daughter and trying to bring her to our first meeting. I can’t imagine myself dating someone who would expose his kid to a stranger. It would have been better for him to just ask to reschedule because now I’m completely turned off.

byr1qf	2019-06-10 00:09:58	aboutagirl524	WIBTA to ask for free furniture delivery?	"My husband and I had to purchase a new couch and love seat this weekend after an overly intoxicated houseguest (my younger brother) peed all over our sectional. It was due to be replaced anyway but it wasn’t an expense we had been planning on ASAP. Bro has no $$ so asking for reimbursement or help with the expense is out of the question. Can’t get blood from a stone type deal. 

Anyway. We found a decent set at a local place on Saturday. We have a toddler and dogs so we’re not in the market for anything crazy expensive that we know will get destroyed. The set cost 1000$, which we paid for in full to the store but on credit to a third party lender. 

We declined delivery bc we have a full sized pickup truck and can handle moving two pieces of furniture ourselves (hubby is army and I’m prior service army so we can manage..). We clearly let the store employees know we’d be back Sunday to pick up the two pieces multiple times to multiple people. 

The owners/main employees are an older married couple—the husband just had surgery on his leg and is in a cast.  Wife is in her mid 60s and really not in shape in any way to help load furniture. Hubby went to pick up the set at 2pm (the store is open 1pm to 6pm on Sunday). When he arrived, they had clearly forgotten about our pickup. The set wasn’t ready to go and no one could help my husband get it in our truck. They said we could get it today still if he came back with help and they would get it wrapped up in plastic wrap for us. 

I did not accompany my husband to the store because he felt it was easier for me to watch our toddler at home vs dragging our kid to the store and to use the opportunity of when my husband was picking up the furniture to do a nice deep clean of the living room area before we got our new stuff. We live in the country and a round trip to town where the furniture store is approximately 30 miles or about an hour round trip. 

My husband wasn’t confrontation in any way. Not his style. He was just a bit taken aback at how it was handled and agreed to return tomorrow to get the furniture. The couple who own the store were very sweet and accommodating when we were shopping but I feel a bit let down now. We already moved our sectional from our home so now we’re furniture-less in our living room. 

The weather is expected to be extremely rainy and poor the next few days where we live. This afternoon today was the only good window so far as forecasted for the next 48+ hours with a less than 50% chance of rain. Obviously even with plastic wrap, we don’t want to transport a living room set in the rain in an open bed truck. 

WIBTA if I call them up tomorrow and ask for free delivery for our trouble? If I’m just naive bc I don’t know how furniture stores work, please tell me!

However, I sometimes get extremely anxious after hearing stories of people dying at a young age of some unexpected illness as this is one of my biggest fears. I have a relative (i'll call her E) who pretty much gets off to telling stories about people dying, divorcing etc . Basically anything that she can create drama and be fake-sad over. I asked E multiple times (nicely) to please don't tell me illness-related horror stories because I'll have nightmares and anxiety for weeks after hearing some of them. On Monday we were at a family function and she out of the blue started to tell me a story about a young man in his 30s who died of a heart attack caused by a blood cloth. She also added that the guy worked in the same field I study in and how tragic it is that he died so young and unexpectedly. I got irritated and asked her why it was necessary for her to tell me that . She laughed in my face and called me oversensitive and a crybaby and said that these things are part of life.To which I asked her whether she would be happy if I constantly showed her pictures of car accidents as they are part of life too. She didn't answer and left the room. So after she went home I sent her a picture of a bloody corpse on messenger. She seemed shocked and disgusted and asked me what was that for. I told her that showing her that picture was not different than her telling me in detail about every strange death and illness that happened to people she knew.

Not that I completely want to keep the baby from him, but talking to him in any context leads to a fight. So we’re currently not even speaking. He’s mad that I don’t want to talk to him at all about anything until the baby comes.  When I’ve pointed out the legal rights he has is zero until paternity/custody is even established, he’s gotten very angry. Albeit, I mentioned it to show him that he needs to start treating me decently or else I don’t have to include him in anything. Obviously that backfired.  He’s tried to make deals, by offering to pay for half my medical bills if I let him talk to the baby (my bump, inside me, meaning I have to basically have conversations with him for the next four months). If not then he’s offering no help financially. So far I’ve been basically overwhelmed and stressed out, and he hasn’t been helping me emotionally or financial. We don’t live together.

At this point, would I be the asshole if I keep him out of the delivery room, out of my whole life until baby arrives and custody can he agreed upon? 

It’s very painful to talk to him, because to be frank I’m still not over him, and despite our issues wanted to still work it out - go to couples counseling and be a family- and he gave up. It’s very hard to get over someone when they’re baby is growing inside of you, and they are very much trying to interject every part of my body/pregnancy."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Last year December I met someone, who I will call S for now, and became friends with. We had a mutual friend, who will be J, I thought he was nice, but apparently S had their reservations about J, despite J repeatedly claiming S was their best friend.

S told me a number of things they were bothered with concerning J, but the most concerning thing S told me, was that S didn't really like J anymore, and S was essentially using J in order to keep in contact with J's family, as S did like them.

Not too long ago, S and I had a fight which I won't detail, but S told J. So today, I met with J and J mentioned that S was currently at their house. At this point, I was stuck; between telling J about what S said, or keeping it a secret and letting peace be.

My primary reason for not telling J was because I didn't want to touch their friendship or disturb the peace; S hated me, but that's fine. My primary reason for telling J was that I genuinely liked J, and in my opinion, S was using J, and J didn't deserve that.

At the end of the day, I decided to tell J what S said, and also mentioned several of their complaints about J. J was skeptical but said they wouldn't necessarily be surprised if it were true.

Today my dad had me outside for several hours cutting the lawn and weed whacking around the house. After around 4:00pm and being covered in sweat and dirt (it was like 85F and I was out for about five hours), I finally came in. 

My dad said ""Jack, make dinner, I bought groceries this morning."" I told my dad ""No dad, I dont want to. I'm tired and want to rest."" He then replied ""Damn it Jack! Dont argue, just make dinner."" We were both hungry but neither of us wanted to cook dinner (it was chicken breast, potatoes, and veggies). 

Anyway, I was really furious with him so I took his wallet and drove to Wendy's. I ordered like $30 worth of food (like 5-6 of each burger) and brought it home. I come home and say ""Ok, Dad, dinner is ready.""

He comes into the kitchen and says ""What the hell Jack, where did all this Wendys come from?"" I told him ""I bought it because I didn't want to cook food - oh, and BTW, I used your Visa.""

Anyway he was pissed and said ""This was really idiotic."" But then he TOOK the burgers (and a Frosty) and watched Dexter on the living room TV and ate (I went to my room and watched Breaking Bad). 

Now I feel bad for not cooking dinner AND using his money. BUt I was super tired from working *ALL* day and it wasn't fair I had to cook - he could've (but he was helping me a bit too).

My friend is in her early 20s, she has worked very hard to save so she can buy her childhood home from her mother (who plans to downsize). She has lived there since she was 3, and wants to raise her kids there too. Over the years she has also paid for things like new paint and other small projects.

Her boyfriend and her have been dating for a while. They aren’t engaged but they have talked about getting married a lot, and have established that they want to spend their lives together.

Her mother has pointed out that if she gets married and move into the house together, should they divorce the house could be viewed as equally shared, so without a prenup friend could face losing the house she has worked so hard for (she of course wouldn’t want a divorce, but she’s had a lot of those in her family so in her mind it’s a “better safe than sorry” kind of thing). She is in no way rich and neither is he, but even though it’s just a “what if”, she doesn’t like the idea of losing her childhood home solely as a result of a divorce.

She mentioned this to the boyfriend, basically her idea would be that what’s hers remains hers, what’s his would remain his, and anything they share would be split equally.

In his mind, the fact that she would even consider a prenup means that she doesn’t want them to last long term. She’s tried explaining her side to him but with no avail. She never wanted to hurt his feelings and I know from our conversations that she loves him more than anything and wants to spend the rest of her live with him.

Is she the asshole here?

My EX-GF and I were really close friends for several years. We have a pretty big circle of friends together (for over 15 years now) and they are like family to us. Ex-GF was in a kinda unstable relationship with a guy who was not part of this circle. One day they broke up and 1 1/2 years later we became more than friends. We were a couple for over 2 years when she left me because her ex told her that being friends is not enough for him and he wants her back. We broke up because she still had feelings for him. 6 month later they became a couple again and now (1 1/2 years after we broke up) she is integrating him into our circle of friends. I have absolutley no interest in befriending him. I am not even really befriended with my ex anymore. But we still have the same circle of friends and he will be part of it sooner or later. So far I am more or less ignoring him. I say hi and bye, thats all.

byqr98	2019-06-09 23:40:00	Princessneon	WIBTA for reporting my Uber driver for picking up other passengers on the way	"For context, I had opted NOT to use the “Uber pool” option. When I got in the Uber, the driver (who I must stress was VERY friendly and personable) asked if it would be okay if he picked up another passenger on the way to my destination, “to kill two birds with one stone”. I tentatively obliged because I felt awkward, and I assumed he had the option to change the pricing from regular to pool in order to pick the other passenger up. Instead, he pulled up Lyft, and picked up two other passengers. They were also not told they would be sharing the ride, as they were both visibly surprised and had to have the situation explained to them. 
From there, the experience was fine. We were going the same way, the other passengers were no issue, and the driver truly was pleasant and attempted to make conversation amongst us. 
However, I checked, and I was still charged the full amount, as if I had ridden solo. The difference is almost $6, which isn’t a ton of money but it’s the principle more than anything. 
I am strongly considering reporting him, but am feeling super guilty. I know a lot of people who use Uber driving to work their asses off and who really need the money, the guy is just trying to make a living. That being said, it feels really unprofessional to charge people and pool them regardless.

So I don't really enjoy speaking with my parents or sister. For my sister and dad, I just feel like any conversation is kind of forced, I don't get anything out of it, I have no real interest in their goings on, I feel like it's contact for the sake of contact. I don't know why, I just don't seem to care. I'm glad they are happy, but I just feel annoyed whenever they contact me.

&#x200B;

For my mom, it's a little different, whenever we talk, it always gets around to the fact that I need to lose weight. I am obese, and she is just concerned, but she never stops. ""why don't you get gastric bypass?"" I have asked her to stop, and she doesn't. I am 100% aware of the health risks. On top of this, whenever in the past I have dieted, she would continue to purchase foods for me like pizza and fries, etc, unhealthy stuff. She still does sometimes even though I don't live there. I never understood the telling me to lose weight on one hand and buying me 3 frozen pizzas the next day mentality.

 Maybe I'm depressed, probably. I am on meds for depression/anxiety, and what do they do? They make me mostly emotionally numb. But at least I don't have panic attacks.

byqq0v	2019-06-09 23:36:34		AITA for getting upset at my ex and best friend for trying to see a movie a week and a half after we broke up?	"Using a throwaway because my friend is a redditor and might see this. I'll delete it if it gets too much traction.

Pretty straightforward. Girlfriend of 5 months and I broke up a little less than a month ago, on okay-ish terms (I'm 22M btw.) I was feeling alright about it because we didn't have any overlapping social groups and wouldn't have to interact with each other after the breakup, which would help us get over each other. Fast forward to a week later and she texts my best friend of about a decade, asking to see a movie at his place. (They got along really well while we were dating so I can't say I was surprised.) He brings it up to me, which I respect, and I tell him she and I just broke up and I'm not really feeling comfortable with it. It should be noted that he's hooked up with an ex of mine in the past, and while that played a part in my discomfort, it also felt like a week and a half after this breakup was way too soon.

He still wants to hang with her, so he takes her up on the movie. Before then, I get in touch with my ex and talk to her about it. She tells me she didn't want to leave the friends she made by the wayside just because we broke up, and she wanted to hang out with him so she could apparently talk about me, and hear about how I've been doing from a third party. She invited me after I came to her about it, which I accepted, but it felt like it was because I found out it was happening at all.

A couple days before, my best friend confesses that he had feelings for my ex, which obviously set off the alarms in my head. They were just about to see a movie, at his place, that she didn't tell me about, and now there's this weird dynamic on top of that. I suggested that we shouldn't hang out with our exes one on one anymore, which he didn't take very well. But considering our past and how I was feeling about this, I felt like a boundary was necessary.

At this point I don't know who to trust, and I'm having a panic attack. I get upset with him for following through on the movie, knowing what I know now. He was about to buy a $200-300 sound bar just for this movie. My ex calls me and the conversation doesn't go very well. She's appalled that I would even insinuate that she would be going after my best friend, even if the situation was objectively sketchy from my point of view. She doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and my best friend is saying he's sick of my ""jealousy issues"" beating him down. At this point the movie has been cancelled and isn't happening at all.

I called a mutual friend and explained everything to her, and she completely got where I was coming from, but my ex and best friend are both upset that I don't trust them, which is why I'm making this post. I'm really morally conflicted and not sure whether I'm in the right because of my emotional outburst. I could just be insecure and have some serious trust issues that need some working out, but whatever their intent was, I feel like I had a right to be uneasy about it. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I'm 33 years old and I've pretty much always lived with my parents. To me there's no shame in it because it's super cheap (they charge me $200, which honestly would be market rate where we live) and it has everything I want and need without the hassle of having to look for a new place to live. 

We get along most of the time but honestly I just avoid them. Recently the toilet flooded in my bathroom which means they are having to remodel my section of the house so we ""run into"" each other a lot more than when I used to lock myself in my room most of the time. 

Well today my parents went to Costco. When they got home I was sitting on the couch playing Apex and my mom asked me to get up and help them bring in groceries. I told her in a minute. I was honestly too into my game to notice that they made several trips back and forth and finally my dad told me to get my ass up. I told him I would in a minute. He said a minute is now and grabbed the controller out of my hand. It turned into a huge shouting match and now they are checking into a hotel and expecting me to have a place to live by Friday (which is basically impossible). Of course they brought up my younger brother who is married with two kids and was just promoted at his job. They have their golden child of course but to throw his shit in my face is bullshit. 

I  mean I guess I could have gotten up and helped them but to me because I pay rent that gives me the privilege to pretty much say no when they ask me for stuff like helping with groceries or yard work.

byqnb0	2019-06-09 23:29:23		AITA for resenting my mom?	"I was pregnant with my daughter few months ago (dd is now few months old). I'm a First time mom and I had a lot of anxiety throughout my pregnancy. My husband and I picked a name for our daughter and I got too excited and shared (not asked or discussed -just told that we found a beautiful name) it with my mom. She immediately got all hyper saying there's a girl she always hated back in school with that name. All of her friends and siblings also know that girl.. so they would mock her for naming her grand daughter that. 
I was stuck in a rut. I didnt know what to do. We lived the name so much so we decided to keep that as middle name. I regretted discussing name beforehand but I think she'd have argued even after announcing officially. Everytime my mom enquired about the name I only told the first name.

She came over to our place to help me during delivery. When we were in a happy mood, I brought the name up and told her we decided that would be the middle name ( I wanted to ensure that it wont come as a shock to  you want, dont discuss your personal decisions with me"". Few days passed and it was time for my delivery. I was in the L&D room and I was resting for a few minutes in between the pushes. My husband was almost in tears seeing me go through all that.. my mom came over to my side to feed me ice chips.. and she said why dont you consider a different name as middle name.. and she suggested a new name. I didn't bother replying. But the moment she picked to ask me that question? My mind was blown. I had so many other emotions going on but postpartum mood swings.. we left the hospital without naming our baby. My husband and I didnt have the privacy to discuss baby name in front of her and every time a nurse/doctor asked the baby's name.. we didn't want to tell it in front of her. Something that was supposed to be happy, turned out to be awkward. 

Another incident, While I was pushing, I asked my husband and mom to not look down there. My husband kept looking at my face and my mom stood behind my husband. She kept looking anyway. But by then baby came out. Once we came back home she had the audacity to wink and tell me that she had seen her granddaughter enter the world. She said she wanted to go touch the head too but she took pity on me because I may want to hold her first and stepped back. 

I dont know. Two major life moments and she kept messing with my head in the most vulnerable time. I have so much anger I dont think I can forgive her."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byqn8a	2019-06-09 23:29:11	throwaway2225178	AITA for walking around nude in my flat?	"(throwaway acc because this is mortifying)

I recently moved into a new flat, in a very remote area. I'm on the 5th floor and surrounded by trees mostly, but there's one higher building across the road. And apparently, the people that live there have a really good view into my huge bedroom window from their balcony (only from their balcony).Now I have some sensory processing issues and prefer to be naked whenever possible (read: when I'm in my own private 4 walls, of course not anywhere public) because fabrics on my skin tend to get irritating. I've never had anyone complain about this before. Of course I don't flaunt my nudeness in front of the window and stand there waiting for someone to take a picture, and most of the time the curtains are drawn. I thought the chances of anybody catching a glimpse were slim to none.

Well, apparently the neighbours caught a glimpse anyhow, and not just once it seems. First, I had a note in my postbox, asking me to please not show myself naked anymore. I sent them a note back, saying I didn't have to cover up in my own flat, but would be more conscious of it from now on and that they were free not to stare at my window from their balcony. Fast forward a few weeks and my boyfriend visited me, I forgot to draw the curtains. It was night, we had no lights on, I did not think about nosy neighbours possibly being on their balcony at 2 am.

On Friday, I got another letter from them, more formal this time, saying they were going to have me charged with indecent public exposure for having sex ""right in front of them"". I maintain that my flat is not ""public"" in any way, and hence not their business at all. Are they out of line, or AITA?

edit: Their balcony is not directly facing my window

edit2: everybody has been suggesting to get sheer curtains, that's a good idea, thank you.

edit3: I'm actually currently in the Netherlands, and they're usually very chill about this kind of stuff. Not sure about the law, but the law enforcement here barely bats an eye when you're sunbathing in the nude in a public park or even having sex. I've never seen somebody getting into trouble for this."	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
byqm9s	2019-06-09 23:26:38		AITA for not going to a family dinner because of work?	"For background, I work in healthcare on night shift and right now I’m in the middle of a 4 night stretch of 12 hour shifts. 7pm-7am. 

My family invited me to dinner, which I politely declined because I work tonight and have been the past few nights, and still work again tomorrow. I’m exhausted. Between each shift I’ve gotten about 4 hours of sleep. My fuse is super short right now. 

The problem is that my family, including husband, have been hounding me about going up to dinner 3 different times now. Each time with a different bribe to get me to go (“we’ll cook for you early, your family is here”, etc). 

This last time, I sort of blew up on my husband over text. 
I told him that I had said no 3 different times, and that I’m frustrated because it seems like no one is taking me seriously. I go to work and stay up the entire night taking care of people. I prepare for that by taking care of myself before shift. And that means peace, quiet and space. It’s always been that way. 

But now I’m getting passive aggressive “our bad, k sorry” texts from him and it’s making me even more upset, but also kind of making me feel like an asshole. AITA?

Okay, so I've always been really good with money. like, a lot. always saving up and buying expensive things for myself. I never got any gifts for my birthday or Christmas, and my family couldn't/can't afford any more than they already need to pay. lately, I've been saving money to buy a Nintendo Switch (Upwards of 2000$), since I've already bought a phone. I was about 500$ in when my mother told me to keep it with her so that I don't lose it. OK, the money stays with her.
Then, about a week later, she comes home with an electric bicycle (we don't have a car) that's more than 4000$. we'll, for her, it's just 3500$ because she spent all my money on it. ALL OF IT. she said she would pay me back later. I stopped giving my money to her after that. This will be important later.
So, we're walking down the street one day and we pass by a subway, the fast food place, not the train thing. since where I live subway's actually good I ask my mom if we can go in and get a sandwich. 
""no, I don't have money"" 
""please? actually, I'll pay!"" 
then she goes silent, proceeded by a (very loud) rant about how I'm disrespecting her by implying that I have more money than her, that I've became a stingy spoiled brat that's ""just like your father"" (cliché, right?) and all that fun stuff. after what felt like 10 minutes of trying to calm her down, she just throws a 10$ bill at me and says ""go buy the thing"". what she didn't account for was the fact that a 15cm sandwich is, well...15$ but hey, free money's free money right? so I just go up to the counter and ask for the one that's the cheapest and eat it in silence while she avoids making eye contact. 

I touched on it briefly, but the whole ""you're a disrespectful brat"" thing really made me sad. this has happened many times before, and I want to know what made her feel like this. she always spent my dad's money without care, she's living off of child support and doesn't plan on getting a job. it's not my fault a 13 year old can manage money better than her... right?"

My mom asked me if I wanted to have a graduation dinner and I said yes because it sounded like a great idea and we rarely get to go to nice restaurants. 

However, recently she came up to me and told me that she would be inviting 16 people to my graduation dinner. My mother and I have never gotten along, personality and values wise, and we’re at each others throats most of the time. She is very extroverted (my whole family is) and loud (again, my whole family is). By loud, I mean that sometimes at family reunions (Christmas, Thanksgiving) I genuinely have to excuse myself to not get overwhelmed.

I told her that I did not want 16 people there and I told her the people that she didn’t have to invite from the list that she gave me. I said that there was no need for my best friend’s mom to be there (she agreed), however I also said that I didn’t want my two cousins and their respective boyfriend and girlfriend to be there. I told her it was simply a matter of “I can’t handle that many people” and it wasn’t anything personal. 

She said that she will invite them (my cousins & their S.Os) because it would be rude not to and she has to invite them. She said that when I said yes to having a graduation dinner, it was understood that she’d be inviting our whole extended family.

I feel that because this event, unlike Christmas and Thanksgiving, is about me then I should be able to ultimately decide who I want and how many people I want there. I feel like I’m already making concessions having 10 people there, because if it were up to me then i’d really only want like, five. But she keeps saying that not everything is about what I want and that its completely rude not to invite my whole family to this. So, am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	267.0	28.0	0.0	0.0
byqkt6	2019-06-09 23:22:50	CSThr0waway123	WIBTA if I continued to use my temporary handicap parking pass after I was able to walk slightly?	I recently broke my leg and I was told I wouldn't be able to walk for another few months and that I would likely be limping for a while after I was able to put weight on my legs. I already don't see any people with broken legs parking in handicap spots, so I was surprised when I was offered this pass for my injury. My main question is, once I'm able to put weight on my legs but am still a little limp, would I be the asshole if I still used the parking pass? Like, if I could comfortably walk with a slight pain and/or limp, would that be reasonable enough to continue to use the pass? The pass is valid for the next 6 months, so I don't think i could get into any LEGAL trouble, but I still don't want to come off as an asshole.

On friday night I started to go down with a bit of a fever and a headache. I suspect its a minor case of strep since my boyfriend has it as well. No big deal, Ill just go to my school clinic on Monday for a checkup and some antibiotics, and chill at home over the weekend. My dad texts me how im doing, and I say im fine just a bit of a headache and that I might have gotten strep. He says okay, feel better and then we both go to bed. 

The next day (Saturday) he video calls me and says I should go to the ER to get antibiotics. I tell him to calm down, its not that bad and Ill just go to the clinic on Monday. I dont mention that this is largely due to price, as an international student my insurance doesnt cover much, because everytime I mention money around him he gets all insulted. Hes terrible with money. We argue for a bit, I say whatever and Ill go on Sunday even though I know most clinics are closed that day just to end the call. 

Today, (sunday) it gets even worse. He tells me I need to go to the Emergency Room now. He claims that Im going to get meningitis, that someone died with infected kidneys and that was going to happen to me, and that I would contract a flesh eating bacteria of some sort. I try to level with him, pointing out that strep is fairly common and that serious cases only happen in imunocomproised people or those with weaker immune systems like children or old people. He refuses to listen, claiming that even the smallest chance of me getting a blood infection warrents me going to the hospital now. When i keep on arguing with him, he gets kinda pissed and says that my judgement is bad, that he used to think I was smart up until now. We end the video call. Mid day I start to feel better, and text him such so he'll stop worrying. He doesnt, and what he does instead is look for my boyfriend on facebook (im sure he would have done other people by going through my friend list on facebook had I not blocked him) and sends him a wall of text essentially asking him to convince me to go to the ER and not to tell me he sent that text. My boyfriend didnt send me the entirety of the text, but I suspect there was more shit about my judgement because he also randomly texted me that Im smart enough. I called my dad to ask wtf, and he refused to back down repeating that I was making stupid choices and that I might die over what is frankly a fairly minor infection.

Im just tired of him treating me like a child, and i needed a break from him so I blocked him on facebook and whatsapp.

TL;DR i got sick with some strep throat, dad panicks and says I should go to thw ER. I insist that ill just go to the clinic when it opens, so he starts texting my boyfriend trying to get him to make me go to the ER; i get pissed and block him on everything"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I check back a little later but she is still working and I say we’re starting the movie in 10min and is she going to come or not? And she said sorry she’s pushing her deadlines and can’t just stop working for 3 days straight. I got annoyed by that and took her tablet computer and said if she doesn’t wanna spend time with the family then she should atleast go do something healthy for once (she spends hours upon hours on that thing). She got pissed and reluctantly went to the living room and watched it with us but didn’t seem happy about it at all. that Just crossed the line for me, it’s just rude and immature to be all pouty about it. So afterwards I said I’d give her computer back but I wouldn’t allowed her internet access for the remainder of her stay (I think this is reasonable as she is using the internet I am paying for). And she said fine but she still has work to do so she’s heading home early. I don’t see why she can’t just accommodate for her shedule it’s not like she has a boss to fire her but instead she has to be pouty and leave. AITA?	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Eg= Eb’s girlfriend 

Me= you guessed it me

Be me a girl that’s friends with my ex. This is great until one night. We were on a live on this social media app (Random people could just join and watch you) with me him and one of my good friends. Earlier a dude was talking and complimenting me N noticed I was uncomfortable so she roundhouse kicked him out. After he left I wanted to lift the tension and made a joke about this guy who was talking about me being cute I thought it was funny and so did N until Eb goes completely silent.

Fast forward after the call I get a text that says “We need to talk.” I shrugged my shoulders and shot him a call. He said that he didn’t like “other guys talking to me like that” and “I should put some clothes on.” (I was wearing a tank top and some leggings cause it was summer in Cali)

Now I understand his concern it was only a few weeks since we broke up and he had taken it hard. So I don’t remember how the rest of the conversation went but it didn’t strike me as hostile. But I do remember him saying we needed some space as friends. I remember him protesting to that a little but after a little there was no talk between me and him.

After a few days he’s texting me that he had a girlfriend. I thought this was great and I was genuinely happy for him. Until he started making every text about Eg . Now I get it he wants to tell his friends about Eg but every thing I say gets related back to Eg. Now it’s not like we don’t have thing else to talk about.

N said to him that I might have gotten over him to fast and the maybe that fueled this. But, that raises new questions. Was this my fault? Did he do this just to spite me? When I think of that question it sounds disgustingly Narcissistic but only having one thing to talk about with someone gets boring real fast.

About a month ago, I came to the conclusion that my sole friend was toxic. He doesn’t respect boundaries, he’s put me in awkward/uncomfortable situations, and seems to believe that one day, I’d discover that I was actually madly in love with him.

A few prime examples of his uncomfortable behavior is when he propositioned me, where I was essentially trapped because I wasn’t driving; I say “good to see you”, he corrects with “*great* to see you” with a huge grin on his face; the number of shows he’s chosen for us to watch together that have graphic nudity (and he’s always just a bit too close on the couch as well); and the fact we didn’t speak for 3 years, yet he still has a massive crush on me.

Because I’m horrible at confrontation, I decided to just entirely ghost him. I have plans throughout the summer, which have made for a convenient excuse.

Over this weekend, I was supposed to go to a convention—which he knows about (I listed everything I had planned this summer to make it more convincing as to why I can’t hang out); I wound up leaving Friday afternoon due to emotional health reasons. Yesterday—Saturday—my dad and I decided to go on a bike ride to help me out of my funk. As I was helping my dad load the bikes, I noticed a car creep by, immediately speeding up as it passed my parents’ house. From the glimpse I got, it looked like my friend’s car, but I couldn’t be certain.

When I came back from the ride, I had two messages on Facebook from him. (I had stopped replying to his texts, so he began using Messenger.) The first—sent right after I left—asked if I was having fun at the convention. The next was sent an hour later, saying that he knew I was home and demanding to know why I was lying to him. I blocked and removed him on Facebook.

Early today, I noticed he had texted me, wanting to know if I was okay.

I immediately blocked his number.

I realize he's not aware of how his behavior has affected me, and to him, this is coming out of nowhere. He also has pretty heavy family issues, and I've been his anchor and pocket therapist for a while. So, I'm sure for him, this is just a massive, confusing blow.

Am I the asshole for ghosting? Do I owe him an explanation?

&#x200B;

Edit: A quick edit for clarity. He propositioned me for sex at his house, when I had no way home. I was forced into a no-but-yes situation, which was incredibly uncomfortable. I'm also aromantic, which he is fully aware of; I didn't originally mention it, as it didn't seem especially relevant, but I hope it can help people understand why the things I listed made me uncomfortable.

I'm fully aware I may be reading more into it, though--that he's oblivious rather than malicious.

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: Seeing the verdict, I'm fine with being considered assholish. It was a more immature way of dealing with it, I'll admit, and I probably could have done better. However, while I admit it wasn't the greatest method, I do feel justified in it given what I was told coming back from a month-long vacation. My house-sitter saw the same car drive by several times a week and from his description, it was the toxic friend's car. My house is on the edge of a suburb--totally out of the way, and nowhere near anything that would require almost daily visits. I've contacted a former friend who knows him to send a cease and desist message through. If it doesn't work, I'm going to be taking legal action.

Thank you all for your input. If this ever happens again, I'll definitely take the mature route to hopefully avoid things spiraling this hard."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	1.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Sucks, but she deserves someone who can keep up with her lifestyle. The last thing I messaged her when we broke up was I was going to need some time to get over her but I thought she’d be a great friend to have. She never responded. 

Now there’s two reasons I want to reconnect. Firstly (most important) I really do think a platonic relationship would be nice with her. I’m 110% I no longer have any attraction for her so that’s no an issue. Secondly I’m going to be working with her best friends soon, and I think where my ex and I left off will make things unbearably awkward.

My manager also gets irritated when I ask her questions, so I no longer feel comfortable asking her questions. I feel very left out because all the others make conversation with each other, but no one really talks to me.

byqa6b	2019-06-09 22:53:59		AITA for continuing to talk when my parents want me to stop?	"My parents always want to shut me up and control what I say and do and avoid whatever situations we get in, and they always take everything so personally and make me feel like the asshole.

They always ask me to stop talking whenever we get into heated discussions, but I don't see how I'm committing a mortal sin when I don't stop, and they just get flustered for no reason when I continue. Not like I'm saying anything bad, just want things to come to a resolution.

For example:

My mom was talking with my cousin about how other kids show their parents respect and we don't.

I then try to tell my mom how I DO appreciate her and what she does for me, but then she's like ""Making sarcastic comments like 'I didn't know the family was gonna host in your room' when I ask you to pick it up isn't showing appreciation"" (Ut was a joke, not like I DIDN'T clean my room), and how I ""have no respect or appreciation"" for them when I call them names or continue to talk when they ask me to stop talking. 1. I don't ever really call them names outside of when we have arguments, because everything wrong I do they take so personally, and 2. They always want to avoid the situation, but I just want to continue to talk about it because I don't see why not, and so a resolution can be made, but they always get so offended and blow up just because I continue to talk.

I then tell her that I do show respect when I do chores and stuff unlike my (not present) ""little shit"" brother. Then mom is like ""There you go. I will not allow you to berate people like that.""

I then ask her ""How is that berating? I'm not going off on him""

But then she gets so offended and triggered and she's like ""Oh my God, I'm done, it's always just circular arguing with you"" and tells me to shut up. Like ??????????

I try to tell her that it's not like I didn't clean my room and that was showing respect, and she's like ""Son just STOP TALKING"" really loud, and I said loudly as well ""Okay I've stopped!""

And then she doesn't take her own advice and she says to my dad really loudly ""This is why I don't host people over! I have to deal with the stress of preparing and then dealing with my kids!"" And then my dad says, ""Yeah, it's bullshit!"" which just makes me feel bad. They complain about me not taking in their feelings but then do crap like that. Makes me feel like I have to continue talking.

I try to talk about it with my dad, but my dad does the same thing and yells at me to stop talking. Like WHY NOT???

It feels like my parents are trying to control what I say and do and emotionally manipulate me into being submissive.

Even my sister is against me continuing to talk so I'm not sure if I'm wrong or they are. 

They get so flustered so easily and takes everything so personally. I for one would like to move out as soon as I can and never look back so this can just fucking stop."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I (22f) am living with my mom and siblings this summer before graduate school starts up in August. I brought my 3 year old dog Dexter home with me of course. We have a screened in front porch area connecting to the front door. Usually at least once a week, my brother (19) mistakenly lets Dexter outside the front door when he’s leaving the house. We live in an extremely busy area and there’s always traffic. The first few times he let him out, I tried to be understanding and remind him how dangerous it is for Dexter to be let out with all of the cars. Recently I’ve been losing my temper, getting angry with him and he never apologizes. I get that it’s an accident but  imo he needs to be more observant and cautious. There’s a pretty high chance that every time he gets let out he could get hit by a car and die. My sister, mom and I rarely accidentally let Dexter outside. 

Today my brother let Dexter out and he almost got hit by 3 cars before catching him. I was extremely upset, telling him he needs to watch what he’s doing and stop letting Dexter outside. It’s really starting to make me angry. My girlfriend told me I shouldn’t be upset because it’s an accident and we let him out sometimes too, and how do I quantify how many times is too many to get angry? My girlfriend and my brother were both annoyed at me for being mad Dexter was let outside, and said I was being a jerk. I think when it’s a regular thing that’s risking my dog’s life, I have a right to be mad. Not letting him outside when leaving the house is a very easy thing to do.

So, AITA for getting mad when my brother lets my dog out? My family seems to think so but this is a regular thing that’s easy to prevent, and I don’t understand how they think I’m being the asshole here."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byq8dm	2019-06-09 22:49:06		AITA for not inviting a friend to go bike riding, when he lives far away?	"Hey, people of AITA.
This is gonna be a rather light post, that came from a dumb arguement.

Involved in the story (Fake names)
Adam, Stephen, Tim, Me.

So, this story started yesterday.
Yesterday, me and Stephen wanted to watch Godzilla II on the weekend. It wasn't good for him on Saturday, and it wasn't good for me on sunday, until about 5 pm(i could've gotten off earlier if I wanted to) , so we decided to go on monday.

I asked Tim, if he wanted to go see Godzilla II on saturday, and I would rewatch it on monday with Stephen.

Tim insisted he wants to watch Detective Pikatchu. I checked and told him, that they don't play it in the cinema anymore. So I asked him ""Do you wanna Watch Godzilla II?"" He said ""I dunno.."".

This went back and forth a while, and in the end, we decided to go cycling instead, because we live in the same town and came easily meet up and go. So we did.

Next day, I get home, and, Stephen and I began to discuss our plans of going to the cinema on monday. Which train we'll take and at what time we'll meet and such. We ask Adam and Tim if they want to come along.
And then they revealed that they already watched it on Sunday, without ever inviting us, or telling us. Now, remember, when I asked Tim to watch said movie, he refused.
So I asked them, mostly Adam, why he hasn't bothered to tell us? (I didn't really question Tim as he is very unreliable and all over the place.). And he said how they had ""Just randomly figured out during a discord call to go and they went.""

We then again, asked why they didn't tell us. He then said ""We invited you to discord but we refused to come""
I went and checked the groupchat log, where they have claimed to tell us to come to discord (a chatgroup NOT on discord) They haven't mentioned Discord for 3 days, and I checked EVERY groupchat to make sure. Nothing.

So, I told him, it was sort of a dick move not to tell us, and he said
""Well, you didn't invite me to cycling either.""

Me and Tim live in  a city, let's call it ""Smol City"". And Adam lives in the Capital city.

For me and Tim to meet up, as we live in different parts of Smol City, we'd have to cycle about 5 minutes each and we meet.

For Adam to get here, he'd have to get on a train, (3/6 trains stop at Smol City). Travel 21 minutes by train, get off, and then cycle uphill for 3 kilometers, to meet us.

So, it was illogical to invite him. By the time he would've gotten here, me and Tim would've already been pretty much done cycling.

But, I do see his point. That we can't execpt him to invite us to the cinema, when we didn't invite him cycling. So I think everyone sucks here, or I'm the asshole.
But, my parents (and Stephen) firmly believe Adam and Tim are the major assholes here.

"I've been with my boyfriend for about 8 months now and things have been going really well. We live about 30 minutes apart and his house is bigger, nicer, and closer to downtown so we spend much more time at his place than we do at mine. My boyfriend has been living in his house for almost ten years and is in the process of purchasing it from the owners. They have always been very leniant about him painting/marking the walls so at some point my boyfriend thought it would be fun to start a height chart on one of the walls for him in his roommates (like parents do to keep track of their kids growing.) Over time, it became a tradition for friends and family to mark their heights and names on the wall. My boyfriend is really popular and therefore the wall is filled with friends and acquaintances. He loves it because it gives him a reminder of all the people who he cares about and is a fun thing for guests to do when they stay over. 

However, my boyfriend also has gathered a fairly large number of exes over the years and their names are on the wall too. Every time I walk by them I'm forced to think about their relationship. It makes me so uncomfortable. Yesterday, when he was at work and I was in a terrible mood so I went and erased his exes names from the wall. The pencil marks are old and one of them was written in pen I think and made big smudges on the wall. I tried to clean it up but it's pretty obvious they were erased. 

When he got home, my boyfriend noticed and asked me about it. I told him the truth and that it wasn't healthy to hold onto the past like that. I told him I didnt want to live in a museum of his past sexual history. He got really upset and told me I was being possessive and overreacting. He then said I was going to make it awkward the next time his exes came over (they are still friends and are dating other people in his friend group) because they will notice their names are gone and will think my boyfriend did it. 

I'm just upset he cares what they think and isn't respecting my comfort in his house. I've asked my friends and have gotten mixed answers.

I generally don't think i'm an asshole for this but all my friends tells me that i suck.

&#x200B;

My mother is super religious (muslim) and growing up i never had a birthday ( i'm 22 now ) no gifts no cakes not even a happy birthday , i wasn't even allowed to go to anyone birthday and that was because my mother says birthdays are haram in islam , honestly that's just utter bs. Anyway now she's 50 and every year she gets mad at me and calls me ungrateful because i don't get her anything on her birthday. And when i point out that birthdays are haram as she told me a thousand times when i was young and she never not even once celebrated mine she told me things has changed and it's not the same 

&#x200B;

Now she celebrate my 2 sisters birthdays ( 12 and 16 )and i do also ,  when its my mom birthday they get her buy her something and throw a small party for her but i don't attend any of them.

Her husband lived with my mother and her 3 sons, about two years before that. He never tried to supplant our father in our lives but did his best to provide a male figure during the week when we were with them. 

Note: he is a diagnosed with paranoid-schizophrenia. He’s also a recovering addict of both narcotics and alcohol. My mother met him while they were both community college while they were both trying to put their lives together after divorces at around 40. He was the exact opposite of my father and all of our families, who lived normal rural/suburban lives and any of the context with her husband was shocking to us.

There are a bunch of issues that have occurred of the years, including my mom having to get a second mortgage to pay off $10K in credit card debt form going to the strip club. His 6 month episode of constantly accusing my mother of cheating, only to later uncover that he’s actually been seeing a prostitute. Typically what happens is he blames his illness, finds god and my mother forgives him. He’s also

He has his own “business” that he used to supplement his disability checks. Sometimes there was small amounts of profits and sometimes there wasn’t. His business includes a lot of fairly expensive equipment. Two years ago my mother asked that he wind this down as the stress that goes with the business triggers his paranoia. They’ve asked me since 2017 about me helping to sell the business and equipment. I have had many conversations with them regarding what they need to get so we can sell this, including revenue, profits, a list of inventory and what they’re estimated value is. I’ve had this conversation with them quarterly, and they always give me blank stares and tell me they don’t know any of those numbers. I always reiterate, I cannot do anything without those.

So this weekend, my wife is having her baby shower for our first born and I’m asked to help him sell the business. I had other plans and said, “I’m not going to have the same conversation I have every few months and have him stare at me like a deer in the headlights when I ask him the same questions.”

This morning I’m greeted to this text from him:

“I don't have a deer in the headlights look anymore. I don't need you to help me with anything because you are an asshole. With your personality the only thing you are capable of is paying women child support and buying them houses. Please remember I told you this.”


I’ve yet to get a follow up and am curious if I’m the asshole if I just make it a hard and fast rule that anything he will be attending my family (wife and child) will not be at? I haven’t shown my mother the text, and am not sure how to play it. I’ve spoke with my brothers who both agree that if I decide I’m done with him, they’re also 100% going to support me."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Yesterday I met his friend for the first time and we were sitting down eating and he asked if I wanted water (he meant share his, but I didn’t know). And I was like “oh can you grab my beer, it’s on the coffee table” and he didn’t answer me. And the three of us just sat there in silence till his friend was awkwardly like “which is yours...” and I was like “I didn’t mean for you to get it! I was asking (boyfriend)” And my boyfriendwas like “why can’t you get it yourself”. Which lead to the following conversation - - 


When we talked about it after he said he doesn’t think we should ask each other to do things for the other person. Even if it’s something like “can you grab my phone charger on your way back from the bathroom.”  Small little things. I’m not asking him to do my laundry or clean or anything for me. I’ve always grown up around my friends and family asking each other to do small things like “oh grab this while your up/near it” or even “can you pick this up on your way over”. He says it makes me seem spoiled/entitled when I ask him to do a small task for me and that it i ask something like that infront of other people they will also get the impression that I am spoiled and should just do it myself. I personally don’t have an issue doing small things for those I care about and expect the same in return.  He does do nice things for me without my asking like make a meal, or get food, or flowers. But if I ask him to do something small it’s not okay. If I am able to do something myself he doesn’t think I should be asking him, but I think I’m a relationship especially it’s okay to do/ask each other to do small things. He is Chinese but has been in America for 24 years (I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing), I’m white/born in the US. I personally feel like I’m being reasonable and have never met someone with this view. AITA?


EDIT: first paragraph was just an example that led to our conversation and me finding out that he doesn’t think we should be asking each other to do things if the person is fully capable of doing it themselves (he doesn’t ask me, and I don’t ask him). We both do things for each other without being asked. But I don’t think he’s comfortable asking me or anyone to do small things for him and doesn’t like being asked to do small things either"	Not the A-hole	0	0	716.0	40.0	0.0	0.0

We were in recess with my group of friends and someone mentioned a chat called “friends” where I was never in. I asked if I could get in, and one of the admins accepted. 

However, a couple minutes later I got kicked out of the group, to which I didn’t care tbh until one of my friends showed me what one of my best friends had sent as a message which read:

“Thank god for kicking him out”

I was really f-ing pissed at him so I went and demanded an explanation to why had he posted that. To which he answered he was not in the mood for talking.  I leave towards my classroom and take class. 

I was really pissed off. 

Then, while leaving classrooms he comes telling me how he wants to talk. To which I answered no. He then grabbed me by the shoulder and I told him to let me go. He wouldn’t stop holding me. I pushed him and we started a fight right on the hall. 

We were both reported to the director. And he starts saying how I started the fight while he was just saying that I should stop pushing him. The director defended him by saying how I could not go to demand an explanation and then refusing to talk. 

I refused to talk because I did not want anything like this to happen. However, the director thinks I went out of my way to start a personal fight with him, and that I was in the wrong by refusing to speak after I demanded an explanation. I left the office, went with my other best friend and she told me how I was in the right, not just because I was mad, but because a real friend does not do that.

Stupidly, I didn’t set any boundaries with him and every time we would get high he took it as an invitation to flirt with me so I began to smoke alone and not tell him. One example is when we were watching tv he would show we pictures of guys from grindr and such and ask me to comment on them - At first I brushed it off “yea, yea” but he continued so told him to stop showing me these photos. 

After he moved out, we would text and he asked to stay at my dorm before he flew out. I told him he could stay by me and that we would go to some bars before he left. That night, I got too drunk and when we got back we jerked each other off for less than 5 minutes and then he went down on me before I told him I was uncomfortable and to stop, which he did. In the middle of the night, I woke up to him pulling down my underwear and I sternly told him “No.” The next morning we awkwardly said goodbye and that was that. He continued to text me and ask to FaceTime but I continuously made excuses. 

Recently, I found out that he told some mutual friends about what happened and I didn’t feel it was his secret to tell. I don’t consider myself gay but I will admit to being bicurious. I don’t understand gay culture but I don’t feel like it was his secret to tell and put me on blast while I am still figuring it out myself. Once I found out I was furious and told him him to go fuck himself and blocked him. I never told him why I did what I did and I want him to know but I don’t feel what I tell him will not be spread around.

"I fell like this needs back story to fully get the picture.My mum has 3 kids all to different dads me being the first (14) Second child (11) his dad died in a car crash before he was born and the youngest (6) who’s dad was emotional and mentally abusive to all of us and constantly played mind games and basically bullied me since the age of 4. We were all happy when that relationship ended. It’s been 2 years since then. So it’s safe to say she hasn’t had the best experience with relationships.

Anyway, there is a family holiday all my mums sisters are going with their kids and one really close friend going with her two kids in total there’s 16 of us going not including boyfriend. It’s been a big deal and we’re all excited it’s our first holiday with us all being together. Me and my cousins have been hyped for weeks since we don’t normally get to go on big holidays together.

I’d met my mums boyfriend let’s call him Alex and he’s nice he’s a family guy he looks after my mum and is genuinely a cool guy he’s the best my mums ever had. I was fine with him though it did take me a while to talk to him because It’s a new boyfriend as a teenager it’s hard to go through especially when dealing with the mental health issues from the last relationship. Which btw there’s a lot of and I get taken to therapy where I’m told to talk to and trust my Mum.

I got my mum to give me a run down of all the people going on holiday and been she gets to our family she says Alex’s name it took me by surprise so I obviously brought it up. A big smile came across her face and she told me yes. I said don’t you think it’s a bit soon you haven’t been going out for long. To which she replied “when you know you know” and proceeded to show me some of their sappy love messages with all those quote things that girls put on Instagram he’d sent her and how they’re planning a future together and no one else has done that before and it’s a serious relationship. And to that I agree but I still don’t think he should come on the family holiday since in my eyes he isn’t family he’s a dude who has been going out with my mum for a month.

They really do seem to love each other and this is her first good relationship that seems to be heading down a good road. And he’s a great guy and my brothers have really warmed up to him.

My problem is that she sprung this on me 4 weeks before the holiday in a throw away conversation and NEVER asked for my opinion and how I felt. She normally does and she’s a great mum but it feels like she’s been so busy in love with this guy she forgot that that her own daughter might not be happy with this choice."

Buying expensive fitness programs ? Afterwards she just complains about how shitty it was. She only says everything is shitty. She only gossips. I don't think there is any person she does not gossip about, I even know that she gossips about me (her son) and my sister a lot with pretty much everyone. So up until now I didn't say anything, but today it reached a point where I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

She was on vacation for a few days in another country. During that time my sister and I took care of the house and everything.

So today she came back, I asked her how it was and.. ""Oh my god there was this guy, he was so stupid. He.."" she gossiped about this guy for like 20 minutes (I'm not exaggerating). After she was done I waited for her to start talking about the vacation.. but no. So I asked again ""Alright, but how was the vacation ?"". And her answer ""You don't believe this, there was a woman who was so incredible arrogant.:"" and again, even though it only took her 5 minutes this time. I tried asking her how her vacation was 2 more times, but she only gossiped about random people she met there.

So after that I told her ""I think you should try to focus on the positive aspects a little more, you know ? Wasn't there anything nice ?"" and then something happened that I don't even understand. She started saying ""Yes there were many positive things.. there was a guy for example who was really disgusting.."" and she just gossiped about the guy, but for some reason she thought that was positive. I don't get it.

So I just gave up and said ""ok, well that sounds good."" and since it's late here I went to bed.

But a few minutes later she knocked on my door and told me ""Thank you for telling me that I need to focus more on the positive. It's just.. there were so many bad things happening you know ? There was this man who..""

And at this point I lost it. Like really ? Taking what I said as an excuse just to tell me more about how shitty her vacation was, while I sat at home ? Fuck no.

So I just said ""for fuck's sake, can't you stop talking shit about everything for more than 3 seconds ?"". She just closed the door really loud.

The group consisted of two guys (Ed and Chris), one girl (Maggie), and yours truly [M]. Our topic was about substance abuse. Mostly, things were great since we were brainstorming ideas and assigning roles to each member. While we were working, we talked about our personal lives to try and get to know each other. We discussed what high schools we went to, our family life, etc. Soon, the conversation took an awkward turn. Ed and Maggie began talking about their drinking, drugs, and sex. Maggie started talking about how she lost her virginity when she was 13 and how they boy she lost it to was 12. I was starting to feel quite uncomfortable. She was describing how it happened, which is when I interrupted her and politely asked her if she could please save it for later. She gave me a weird look and asked why. I said I didn't want to hear about how she lost her virginity when she was a minor. I explained that I wasn't comfortable hearing about two minors having sex. She did not take this well. An argument ensued, as she told me that ""people f*ck all the time, get over yourself"". I told her that's not the point, and she snaps with ""Keep that up, and you'll stay a virgin"". At that point, I packed up my belongings and left. So far, I haven't made any contact with them and I'm not sure how to proceed. AITA here?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I keep on trying to make him better and stuff but today, I had enough and I snapped.

I was tired of his cursing at me and yelling at me for no valid reason and yell at him,”SHUTUP FOR ONCE.”

And then he does the occasionally crying guilt trick as usual. I didn’t buy it. He ALWALYS fake cry’s to get his way. How do I know this? BECAUSE EVERYTIME he “cry’s” as soon as he gets what he wants he stops crying and his voice goes back to normal.

Anyways he tells me it’s not his fault he has anger issues and I tell him, then go see  therapist and get help. I also told him at least I got help before that.So this time he actually was crying and angry with me and yelling at me saying, “YOU DONT SAY THAT TO PEOPLE.”!!!

I don’t remember exactly what happened but I woke up the following morning in a hotel room with one of my married colleagues, Evan, whom I’ve always had a strained working relationship. He is a very volatile man and, whilst he could be very kind and generous, was extremely explosive if things did not go his way. I snuck away before he woke up. Evan handed in his notice the next week, and he and his wife moved away. 

Flash forward a couple of months, I’ve missed my period, take a pregnancy test and, lo and behold, I am pregnant. I decide am not keeping it and schedule an appointment with the doctor. In my country, abortion is technically illegal - you have to be approved by 2 doctors and prove that having the baby will seriously harm you (mentally or physically). It can be a very long process.

Whilst I was waiting for my second Dr appointment, I had a miscarriage. Once that was all taken care of, I worked through everything to carry on with my life. It’s been tough but things are going well overall. 

Yesterday, I got a call from an unknown number. I answered and it was Evan. He asked me how I was etc etc - a very strange conversation as if nothing had happened between us. He said he’d been thinking about me and wanted to visit me. Idk what came over me but I just blurted out that I’d miscarried his baby. 

Oh man, he lost his shit. Started yelling, telling me I’m evil, all he wanted was a baby and his wife can’t get pregnant. Said I could have given him the baby. So I flipped and told him I was going to abort it anyway. Then I hung up. He’s been blowing up my phone all last night and I feel like I’m going crazy. 

Am I the asshole for telling him? I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone."	Not the A-hole	0	0	25.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Every week he sends a new complaint to our group chat... 'someone put a non recycling item in the recycling bin,' 'someone has left a plate in the sink for several hours,' 'please put more plastic wrap over item X in the fridge,' 'the tongs are just for salad nothing else' yada yada yada. I can see the look on his face twist whenever he's in the room and sees me make some small kitchen error, it terrifies him and he seems to restrain himself in the moment but it's obvious he gets really upset about every small thing. I'm not some slob, I always clean my dishes and put them away as soon as I'm done, and sweep the floor and wipe the counters etc. I've tried to be accommodating to him but the other day he sent me this text 'FYI' followed by a photograph of the three kitchen hand towels hanging in the positions he likes them to be in, each circled with a color coded list of individual uses, ie 'this one is for drying dishes,' 'this one is for wiping the counter,' 'this one is for drying cast iron pots' etc. I found this to be vaguely condescending and oddly obbsessive so I ignored him and went about my usual routine.  Later he brought it up again and I bluntly told him I do my best to be clean in the kitchen but I'm not consulting some diagram every time I need to use a hand towel, and that he should buy his own and do what he wants with them if it bothers him so much. I also told him not to text me anything like that again unless it was a matter of absolute urgency, like the kitchen is on fire. He doesn't seem thrilled with my response. Thoughts?

bypzlg	2019-06-09 22:25:46	dyna67	AITA for calling my best friend childish and refusing to apologise?	"Me and my best friend are in our early 20s. Yesterday she spend the day with me and this girl I’m seeing so we could study together. I was getting pretty frustrated with her because she would start whining at me that I wouldn’t move away from my gf to come sit with her, and she was sending me really flirty text messages all afternoon with hearts and gifs saying things like “I miss your face” on top of a puppy. I tried to ignore her and get on with my work.

Later on, she posted a story on her Instagram of a birthday cake saying “thanks for all the birthday wishes”. I nearly had a heart attack thinking I’d forgotten, and sent a barrage of text messages to all our mutual friends who had also not said anything, trying to figure out a way to make it up to her.

Well, it wasn’t her birthday. I texted her with a question mark saying her birthday was actually on x date and why the hell did she post that?! and she replied “you passed the test, well done”

I’ve been her best friend for years, and I found it really petty and disrespectful that she would try to test her friendship with me like she was 14 or something. She also posted publicly the names of everyone who wished her a happy birthday to oust them as having “failed”. These are my great friends and we were all angry at her.

I texted her asking her to remove the post where she screenshot my conversation of “passing the test”, and added that I thought it was disrespectful and that she should stop acting like she’s 9. I was upset over this and the events earlier in the day.

She has now cut contact with me saying I am being very rude and don’t respect her, when I think I was being very up front with her as my best friend about behaviour I found out of line.

bypzah	2019-06-09 22:25:01	moni_ue	AITA after a huge family fallout?	"My parents (51M, 50F) had three kids: me (23F), my sister (20F), and my brother (18M). My mother is Asian and my father is Hispanic. I never thought it would be an issue for me to date interracially considering my parents are in an interracial marriage.

I met my boyfriend (23M) when we were both 21. He's black, didn't finish college, and is from the inner-city. To me, none of that matters because he treats me well, works hard, and wants to go back to school. From the jump my dad didn't like him. He'd say that ""their"" culture and values are not the same as ours, that they're not family-oriented and just use and impregnate their girlfriends only to leave them later. My mom asked me not to bring my boyfriend to the house because of how my dad felt, so I didn't. I thought I was being respectful and hoped that eventually they'd come around.

I tried to invite everyone to my events to introduce them on neutral territory, but it was obvious that my parents didn't want my boyfriend there. Eventually, I just kept my lives separate. Due to financial reasons I live in my parents house several hours away from my friends and boyfriend, so I would lie whenever I wanted to meet up with them. The lies were small at first, but they got to the point where I would shut my phone off for days so my parents couldn't track my location. Naturally, panic ensued when I wouldn't answer their calls/texts. They came to look for me, they put me on missing persons lists. It got out of hand. I was never in any real danger, I was just with my friends who would lie for me and cover for me because they too thought my parents were being overprotective and controlling.

After years of my lies and the tracking my phone/laptop/watch, I myself am torn over how to feel. On one hand, I've disrespected them by lying repeatedly about where I am, what I'm doing, and who I'm with. They raised me and supported me financially. My childhood was a happy one and they worked so hard to give me the things I wanted. And I know I've hurt them time and time again. On the other hand, I'm 23 and I don't feel like this will ever stop.

Three weeks ago, I asked if I could go to the city to spend my boyfriend's birthday with him. The result? A huge argument that ended in me leaving. I put a change of clothes into a backpack and had one of my friends pick me up. After several days, my parents said they don't want me to start my life living paycheck to paycheck and that if I come home, we can work on our relationship. I came back because I really believed this was the start to something different.

I know it's still early, but nothing's changed. In fact, I think things are worse than before. My sister and dad don't look at or talk to me. My brother and mom will only talk to me if we're alone. My mom says these are the consequences I have to live with because of what I did, but I don't see how we're supposed to repair any relationships if no one even wants to look at me."

bypxx2	2019-06-09 22:21:10	snowyoaktree	WIBTA for putting a time limit on my boyfriends career?	"My (24f) partner (24 m) and I have been together for 3.5 years after meeting and dating in University. I've never doubted our compatibility for each other as we have a really great, strong relationship with trust, good communication and similar values. We've been long distance for the 1.5yrs while he was off for military training and long distance is working really well for us because we're both able to pursue careers we're passionate about, while maintaining a stable and trusting relationship.

&#x200B;

He's in the military, which he's signed on for a 7 year contract when his training is finished (spring next year, I would move there in the summer). His trade requires a university degree, so when we met I knew he wanted to pursue the military route the entire friendship. Then when we started dating I made it pretty clear that we weren't going to be a long-term thing because I didn't want the military life. He was devastated at this - and said that he would abandon his dream of joining the military to be with me. I refused, because shouldn't give up on his life long dream for a relationship. Through many conversations we worked through it and he convinced me it wouldn't be as bad as I thought and it would be more normal than I realize. He said we can move wherever I want when his contract is up. These tough conversations led to our strength, we fell in love, and that was that. I love my career where I am and I'm close to friends and family so the move will be a big hit for me. 

&#x200B;

Back to the question. He's recently revoked the ""we'll leave after the 7 year contract is done"" thing, saying that he might not want to leave after his minimum contract is up. He doesn't know if or for how long he would want to re-enlist for... but he doesn't want to be pressured to leave a career he likes. It's conflicting because I understand what he's saying in that he doesn't want to promise me something that he might not want uphold. But I also think it's a dick move because I wouldn't do that, especially if my partner abandoned their career to move across the country for me. It's shitty that he revoked this fairly late into the relationship when I was under the impression that in 7 years we could move back to my home city where he could 100% find work in his trade as a civilian (it'll be more difficult for me to find work where we're moving for him). I'm going to go into this move across the country with an open mind, meaning that I'm going to make the absolute best of it, and hey, maybe after 7 years we'll be settled in, I'll be happy & won't be eager to get out of there! But, if I'm unhappy, what if I want us move after the 7 years and he doesn't? He used to say that he would make the same sacrifices for me, but I'm doubting that.

&#x200B;

So, AITA if I tell my boyfriend that I expect him to uphold his statement that he would leave the military after his minimum contract is up even if he doesn't want to? For asking him to make the same career sacrifice that I'm making for him?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	8.0	8.0	0.0	0.0

Over the past several months I began noticing someone I thought was a good friend was taking advantage of me while distancing themselves from me at the same time.  I never said anything because I don't do things for people expecting anything in return, but I was getting irritated because our friendship had become very one-sided.  We hadn't had any arguments or difficulties that would cause them to distance themselves, so it was doubly frustrating because I didn't know what the problem was.  A few weeks ago they got so upset by something they didn't talk to anyone for days, not even to say what was going on.  No one had any idea what the issue was.  We had the kind of friendship where we talked about things that bothered us, but they wouldn't even speak to me about it.  Once they snapped out of it, I talked to them and said I was concerned that they had seemed distant for a while and asked if everything was ok between us.  They said everything was fine (it was an obvious lie) then immediately ghosted me.  Removed me from their social media and started acting like I didn't exist when we were with our group of friends.  This irrational and immature behavior from someone I thought I knew shocked and hurt me, and after wrestling with it for a few days I decided I would just cut them out of my life and move on.  I still have no idea what caused all this to happen.  I feel bad to throw away a friendship, but it sure seems like they don't want to be friends anymore.  AITA for moving on?

bypvc4	2019-06-09 22:14:27	bruhthisistrash	AITA For Telling My Friend’s Parents He Was Smoking Weed?	"First, some background. I live in a very religious community, and my friend (who I’ll call “John”) and I have very religious families. About a year and a half ago, we got into smoking weed as sort of a dumb teenage rebellion. After a while, we and a bunch of friends got caught, and we all stopped. I went to a confession and told my religious leader about all of it, and am now very involved in my religion, with no desire to go back to drugs.

Cut forward to a few months ago, we were hanging out and he told me that he had gotten high again. It was sort of a “I’m confiding in you, because we are best buds” kind of deal. I told him off and said he shouldn’t be doing that stuff because it is really bad for you, and against the commandments. He shrugged it off and apologized, saying he didn’t mean to offend me. After that, I didn’t do anything except prompt him to go to confession and become clean again.

About two weeks later, I went over to his house to hang out and I found him with some of our other friends and a blunt. I contemplated calling the police on them (it is illegal where I live), but decided to just hang out with them and not partake. When the night was done, I went home and felt really awful. I prayed about it, and I felt like I should tell someone. When I woke up, I went to my mom and talked to her, and she told me to go to “John’s” parents about the whole thing. 

Before I knew it, I was in “John’s” house without him and with his parents. I told them everything, and they sat and listened. Then his dad said that they would talk to him about it, and that night he texted me and asked if we could hang out and blow off some steam. When we hung out, he said that his parents had caught him, and he didn’t know how. He was really frustrated and ended up telling me that he was going through a really rough patch that I didn’t even know about—depression, anxiety, the works—and that this had really hurt him.  When I took him back home, he just gave me a hug and thanked me for being a good friend.

After another few weeks of him being grounded from his phone and hanging out with anyone except me, he seemed doing a lot better. He was happy and healthy, going to church with me, etc. and I thought I had done the right thing. 

But then he found out that it was me who told, I don’t know how. But when he found out he talked to me and he started crying, basically saying that I had ruined his life for a minute by getting him in such big trouble, and he said that it wasn’t my place to tell his parents about what he had done. He stormed out, and now our friendship has been really rocky and distant.

TLDR: I thought I did the right thing by getting him back on track and out of drugs, but now I’m not sure if I did, because our friendship is worse off and his family life seems to be objectively worse. Can anybody help me?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bypuk3	2019-06-09 22:12:23		AITA for not wanting to hear about my Fiancée's workplace drama constantly?	"First and foremost I love my Fiancée dearly and I feel really bad for the scenario she's in.

She works full time and to supplement her income she has a second job she works at a few nights a week. 

Long story short some of her coworkers are completely toxic and are openly in subordinate to her, while talking shit behind her and some of her friend's backs. 

This has been going on for the better part of a year and management refuses to do anything. 

Most nights, even when not working the conversation floats back to her coworkers. She constantly texts two friends about it and when we have friends over they also discuss it at length. 

At first I was open and empathic and would just sit and listen without giving judgement or advice. 

I'm sick and tired of hearing about the high school drama (my Fiancée is 26 but works with a bunch of teenagers) and it all came to a boiling point yesterday.

She comes home upset because one of her friends overheard two other girls talking shit. She spent the next hour venting about it, and I think she could tell that I wasn't really listening. 

She started to cry and told me that I'm unsupportive. I said that it's not that I don't support her but this has been going on for the better part of the year and she refuses to talk to management about it or ask to change hours or quit. I explained that I don't want to hear four or five times a week about her high school coworkers. Their behaviour is childish and she should either quit or ignore their behaviour.

At this point she went upstairs and I texted one of our mutual friends who also works with my Fiancée and she said I'm a huge jerk.

bypt5k	2019-06-09 22:08:53		AITA for asking my husband to move my stepdaughter to the smaller bedroom when we decide to have a baby together?	"I love my stepdaughter (SD) very much. I’m actually only calling her my SD here for clarification purposes. I actually refer to her as my daughter in every other situation. 

We live in a 3 bedroom house that my husband bought before we even met. We can’t afford to move to a bigger house, but honestly, we don’t need to. My SD has the bigger of the two non-master bedrooms. She has a front facing window with lots of light, a double wide closet, and more space all around. The 3rd bedroom is a bit smaller (really not much), a smaller side window, and a single wide closet. 

My husband has a custody agreement where my SD only visits every other weekend. We have a good relationship with her mother so she also comes to visit a bit more frequently in the summer months and on school holidays but overall, I would say she spends around 75% of her time at her mothers and the rest with us. She is also 12 years old now and in 6 years will be off to college and what not. She also doesn’t keep much at our house.

I brought it up to my husband that when we decide to have a baby (which is looking like it will be in about a year from now) I would like to move my SD to the smaller room and allow her to decorate it how she would like so that the larger room could be made into a nursery. I feel that a child that lives in a house 100% of the time should have more space than a child who is only here 25% of the time. He got very upset and said that I was being rude and it would hurt my SDs feelings to move her like that and that he won’t allow it.

My SD is mature and a wonderful young lady. She already has two much younger siblings at her moms house (7&3). Their house is smaller than ours and the 3 girls share one bedroom. My SD gets an entire room to herself, even if we move her to the smaller room. I honestly believe if I sat my SD down and explained WHY I wanted to make the change she would 100% understand and be excited to not only decorate her new room how she likes (her current room has older decor from when she was a toddler), but also be excited to help me redecorate her old room into a nursery.

bypptj	2019-06-09 22:00:38		WIBTA for waiting until we are both drunk to make a romantic/sexual advance on my friend?	"Alright, hear me out here.

I’m an upcoming senior in high school and I’m single, but I have a lot of female friends, two of which I find particularly attractive. 

I have three problems though:

1. I’m a pussy and am constantly afraid of rejection from women (which is weird because I am a very confident person)

2. Both of these girls would be in almost all of my classes next year, so if things went bad or I got rejected that would be a level of awkwardness that I’d be around basically all day every day

3. I value both of them as friends significantly, and I would hate for something to happen that would make it weird and thus end the friendship

So I devised a plan. 

A friend of mine is throwing a little house party in a week. There will only be about 8 people there, 3 of which are the two girls in question and me. There will probably be a significant amount of alcohol at the party.

Now you probably see where I’m going with this but I don’t want you to take this the wrong way. I’m not Brock Turner. My goal here is not to take advantage of these girls because they’re drunk. My reasoning is as follows:

If things go badly, I can use the alcohol as an excuse for my behavior to avoid making things weird. So my idea is I make a move on one of them, whichever one I feel better about on that night, but if she shuts me down, I can text her in the morning and be like “hey sorry about what I did last night, I was super drunk and I don’t know what got into me” and then that way things won’t get nearly as weird as if I just made a move in the open instead. This to me maximizes the odds of a good outcome either way.

But part of me feels like I might be taking advantage to these girls. I don’t want to ask them if they’re shitfaced and obviously unable to make a super rational decision, and my main motivator is the backdoor excuse, but I would not be 100% truthful if I didn’t admit that I see the loosening of inhibitions on my part and their part as a benefit.

Give it to me straight, Doc. Am I the asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bypppe	2019-06-09 22:00:20	EscapeFromTheCitadel	AITA for cutting ties with my Father?	"
I’ll preface this by saying my father and I are similar in many ways, one of those ways being difficulty showing and dealing with emotions. Here some BG info Shorted to fit post 5m read

I grew up where corporal punishment was the norm, obviously I was never a fan, but understand that with the somewhat social acceptance of it at the time. As I grew older, and larger, 16ish, this method of discipline became less and less effective until the point where I would no longer allow it.
This lead too my father trying more to discuss issues, if even rarely, a step in the right direction you could assume, fortunately my parent’s marriage broke down, due to his issues with alcohol and participation as a father and husband (strangely enough my father was a nicer person drunk, an absolute fucking idiot, but not abusive), my father then moved away. Our relationship from there hadn’t really progressed. Now while my father is not a good parent, he was surprisingly a good man, who at least through his interactions with others I learnt some good life lessons, but he was and still is very emotional. He calls my siblings, from another country now, on a semi-regular basis and maintains what relationship with them he can. I however being the oldest and perhaps having a more difficult time have had difficulty communicating with him, through my own issues and his, this lead constantly to a breakdown in communication, with him and myself then becoming upset.

This over a few years became tiring, phone-calls from him becoming a chore until it culminated to an event where I had just had enough.

He had called me when I was home, I was there for maybe another day or two, I now live away from my birth country also, the opposite way from him.

Dad-“Son, could you send me a copy of your birth cert?”

Me- “Sorry, I don’t have it, I’ve never held a copy?’’

Dad – “Well could you get me one?’

Me “I can’t sorry, I don’t have time, why don’t you go and get it?’’

Dad- ‘I can’t, it’s yours and I’m in X country anyway.’’

Me – ‘Well, I don’t have time and the process would be the same for you as it is for me, after all your name is on it’’….

I can’t remember exactly what happened from there, as my father became very annoyed, and myself. But he basically got the assumption that I was asserting for some reason that his name should not be on it. Me being his son has never been in any doubt, I’m a walking image. He became verbally abusive and at that point I snapped, told him I was done with this shit, it has become too difficult a relationship to maintain. I blocked his number and that was that, I’m not on social media and my father is certainly not the type to be discussing this to pass on any messages from others. I haven’t heard from him since, the few obscure social sites I’m on I received one request, but immediately blocked, that was maybe 3 years ago now, it upsets me and I’m sure still upsets him but AITA for doing it?"

"I'm a cashier at a craft retail store, and often I get bored of doing the whole ""how are you"" ""good"" sort of thing so I talk to the customers and they tell me about all the cute crafts they're doing. It's fairly obvious if someone doesn't want to talk, so I don't pressure them if I pick that up and simply go through the motions and empty words.

Anyways, a customer came up with a handful of small stuff and simply said, ""I don't want this."" Then started putting the stuff they did want onto the counter. Smiling, I gave a little laugh and while putting it off to the side so I wouldn't accidentally ring it up, joked, ""So why'd ya bring it up?"" After getting no response I glanced up, she was glaring at me and I could tell it bounced. I apologized, telling them I didn't mean to offend, and simply finished in silence. When handing them the receipt I apologized again, wished them a good rest of the day, and left it at that. While we were closing, my manager then told me the customer called to complain and I felt pretty bad because obviously she really hated it. 

I thought I was a good cashier because I'm fast, talk to customers, and I really care about every one of their stories and projects, so typically I don't get these types of complaints leveled against me. AITA, and how can I improve? Thanks! :)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	911.0	244.0	0.0	0.0

We’re 20 now. We are extremely close, this is the person I would tell anything to, without fear of judgement. The thing is, I can only hang out with her one on one. We have really different lives. I work full time and support myself. All of my friends are 3-10 years older than me. Times I’ve tried to include her in gatherings I’ve felt a significant disconnect between her and my other groups of friends. I get secondhand embarrassment and I hate myself for it, but it’s too strong for me to try and ignore. She also tends to reveal things about me to my other friends that I told her in confidence. It’s unpredictable and I hate the feeling of trying to constantly be aware of what she’s saying. She clings to me in these situations. I feel awful about it but I tend to keep my plans with her separate because it gives me anxiety. If I tell her that I did something with my friends, she asks why I didn’t invite her. Or if I do something on my own that we normally do together. I feel like I can’t enjoy things because I feel guilty that I don’t want her there and I know her feelings will be hurt when she finds out she wasn’t invited. But I also don’t think that I should have to invite her to everything I do, and just because she’s met certain people doesn’t mean she knows or has the same connection with them as I do. I don’t like feeling like i’m obligated to spend time with someone or include them in every aspect of my life.

he explained to her that all this must be because she loves him she got confused and told me she wants a break. I told her okay but dont talk to him yet and lets talk as friends for a week she agreed the next day she told me she loves me and she is sorry I told her no problem I understand you better then anyone.
she goes the next day to tell him that she is back with me. they talk and she tells me she wants a break again. I stay silent and tell her same rules talk to me for a week the next day without me asking for anything I was just talking to her mother and after her mother leaves she tells me I love you and I am sorry again I tell her that its okay but we can't be together until she is sure.
next day everything is great and she is 100% sure. the day after it she goes to tell the other guy. they talk guess what she wants another break. and the same rules she tells me she loves me the same day and I stay supportive as much as possible and tell her I understand her and she should take her time.
next week she is someone else its like she just wants to go against me and at the end of the week she tells me she doesn't love me. I can understand that but for the sake of the 3 years take some time to think and she was on her period. so I dont take it too seriously but the week after that she tells the other guy she loves him and they start a relationship 3 days after she tells me. And I take it and try my best to stay calm failed but after I calmed down I talked to her she said this sentence that I had nightmares from 
"" me loving him isn't a mistake towards you"" 
I wanted her to at least admit that Its unfair towards me when All I asked for is a little respect and for her to take her time.
she says she has her reasons which are that she doesn't want to lose the other guy I tell her you could of told him you love him just wait a little until I cool things down. she disagrees and thinks she didn't do anything wrong so I blocked her on all communication devices until she admits that its unfair towards me and she is in the wrong.

bypm8l	2019-06-09 21:51:41	joeltard	WIBTA for confronting my mother?	"So my parents (in their mid 50s) have been happily married for 25ish years and have a gaggle of kids and grandkids. About 18 months ago, my mom started a new job and spends a lot of time with another man (Let’s call him Mark) They share an office, with little supervision. 

Soon after starting this new job working with Mark, he got a divorce from his wife. They had been married for 35 years and the wife apparently was convinced that Mark was having an affair with my mom. 

It’s been a weird few months, and a couple instances specifically have set me off.

1) I was helping my mom setup some tech at a work event. I was there for a while and my mom was around Mark the whole time. At some point someone asked me if they were my parents, which was weird as hell because Mark always talks to me like he wants to be my father figure. Super weird but really pissed me off.

2) Today, I was at a place I don’t usually go to, and I was approached by the woman that got a divorce from Mark. She was very polite but made a clear point about saying “I’m Mark’s ex wife and we were married for 35 years”. Really creeped me out. She didn’t mention anything about my mom or the affair but said more casual things like “I’ve heard great things about you” etc etc...

I know this whole thing is taking a huge toll on my dad. He was the one that told me about Mark’s divorce and was very upset. I’ve never heard my mother talk about it other than acknowledging that Mark got a divorce and it was a hard time for him (didn’t mention that she was the reason lol).

It’s worth mentioning that both Mark and my Mom both work at a church and are very passionate about what they do.

So, WIBTA if I confront her about it and ask her to make some efforts to be around this guy less?

EDIT: they do go on trips together - not sure what their trips look like as far as sleeping arrangements... As far as proof that anything has happened, no proof except for the ugly divorce based on it."	Asshole	0	0	6.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

I’m over 20 years old, my father has abused my whole family all my life but most of the physical abuse has been directly towards my mom. He “quit” when him and I were in bad terms and didn’t talk for 5-6 years.. well, 5-6 years later after having my DD I decided to try to make amends. He agreed. I only did this for the sake of my daughter. Flash forward a few months, things look good and I’m struggling back home, I decided hey why not move myself and child where they are because I can make some money.... well wrong. I had hard times with jobs here. Last year father, we will call him D, started his own company. D decided to ask me to work for him. Almost every day since then I’ve been screamed at and talked shit to. Well D hit my mom, we will call her M, and I told him if it ever happened again he’d be fucking sorry. (He’s hit her before, broken noses, black eyes from “falling”) Well, Flash forward I had another child.  They were doing great so I figured I could move. It’s been several months since I moved out. My brother also still lives there. Well Last night, D broke M’s nose, busted her lip and then kicked the fuck out of her and she wouldn’t let me call the cops, but she is safe and staying with me for anyone wondering. My brother can’t go back either. Now M is staying with my little family and we have nothing for her or my brother. They have no clothes, nothing. I don’t even have beds for them. I don’t know what to do. I can’t. I lost my job so I now have no income, we’ve lost everything even the shit I left there when moving out. I’m so fucking sad. Advice please 😭😭


Update 3:54 PM CDT: D says he doesn’t remember most of last night due to drinking, he said he didn’t hit M and that this is bullshit but she can come get her stuff tomorrow, that we’re back stabbing bitches and pieces of shit and worthless. D wants me to go to work tomorrow but after last night/this morning I’m scared shitless of him and don’t even want to be in the same room as him.. I’m devastated and honestly have no clue how I’m going to even pay my bills without working for him. I have a side business with a company but I don’t sell enough for much commission so I don’t know what to do. Please keep the advice rolling in and keep thinking of us.

Also adding in case this comes up D fired me last night because I didn’t take his side and I left with M.

"My sister in law messaged me on Saturday telling me that my niece wanted to use my pool. I told her that they needed to ask me at least a day before, especially for a Saturday since I always go out on that day. I continued by telling her to come over next Saturday instead to celebrate my dad for Father's Day. Her responds the NEXT day was to tell me to not forget that my brother and our other brother are fathers too not just my dad. I replied by saying ""Your welcome to bring gifts for them and celebrate them too. I'll be celebrating my dad because I'm his child. I mean it's just a carne asada and pool time type of thing. It's not like we're going to sing a song or something. It's has nothing to do with me forgetting. It's just Father's day and I'm celebrating the guy who's my dad. The children will be here too and they get to celebrate their father. When kris becomes a dad our kids would be celebrating him while I will still be celebrating my dad."" I stopped responding after she said that it should be celebrating generally.

I see nothing wrong with the children celebrating my brothers, but I was just stating that I will be celebrating MY dad because he's my dad. It's also being done on Saturday so they can do their thing on Sunday with their children. I asked our other brother of his opinion and he too sees nothing wrong with me saying that. 

A bit of a background to understand our situation: my brother (C) who's married with this SIL never got along with our parents. He's the middle child and always felt like our parents were against him. No matter what they did it wasn't enough for him. His wife basically believes everything my brother has said to her so she holds a grudge against my parents too (even though they took her in when her parents kicked her out when they were teens). My oldest brother (A) is my dad's stepson and he has more respect for our dad than C does.

So all that being said, am I an ass for responding to her that way? I was just trying to explain why I'M celebrating MY dad."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The past year my mom started bringing him around a lot more. At first it was weird, but we’ve been nothing but nice to him and we make conversation to make him less uncomfortable and to let him know we don’t hate him. Just being nice and easing the tensions. 

Anyways, fast forward to this Mother’s Day. I made my mom a big roasted chicken with homemade gravy and all the fixin’s. My mom brought her boyfriend over, which I was fine with. I love cooking for people. I worked really hard on everything all day and finally, everything was done and all that was left was to carve the chicken. 

Now, since I was in the kitchen all day, I didn’t realize how drunk they were getting. 

My mom has her boyfriend carve the chicken and y’all, when I say he absolutely butchered it, it looked like a giant pile of chicken you’d tear up and put into your dogs bowl. There were NO slices. Just torn up chicken bits. I don’t even know how he fucked it up THAT bad. There were even tiny pieces of bones scattered. But I didn’t say anything, whatever maybe he’s just bad at carving. I should’ve done it. My fault. 

Then I notice he can’t even form a sentence or open his eyes at dinner. I finish eating as quickly as possible because I realize about to throw up over everything I worked all day on. I clean up the table and he stammers outside. Then he gets in his car and drives away. 

This man, who couldn’t form a sentence minutes ago, who ruined dinner and the main dish I cooked, who knows I almost died in a drunk driving accident when I was 16 and how against drunk driving I am, just got in his car and drove off. 

Ever since then, I haven’t talked to him while he’s over. I completely ignore him other than a “hi.” I feel like a cunt, but I just really cannot bear to look at him or make conversation. I know it’s hurting my mom, but I have so much hatred for him. AITA?

EDIT: he’s been aware this upset me since a week after this happened and has not apologized or showed any signs of remorse, nor any acknowledgement that this happened. He’s seen me several times. 

EDIT #2: for those telling me I should have called the cops, I understand completely. I’m awful with cars and didn’t know what kind he drove, his license, or his route home. I now know his car type and license. You’re completely right, and I wanted to, but I had no beneficial info to give at the time. I do now.

bypco8	2019-06-09 21:27:20	wondererwander	AITA for telling my mom that I caught my aunt and my adult brother having sex (and getting her kicked out)?	"I’ll just get right into it. My aunt had been staying with us for 4 months. We never saw her  often because she lives on the other side of the country but my mom took her in after a horrible divorce. I immediately noticed that she was acting a little weird/loony but I attributed that to having gone through so much with her husband. My brother (who’s 20) seemed to make a lot of effort to spend time with her but I didn’t think anything of it because why would I? 

I came back early from work one day and heard really loud noises. The more I listened, the more I realized someone was definitely having sex. I instantly thought that my brother brought a girl home or something because the noises came from his room. His door was somewhat open so I rushed past it to get to mine only to be stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the back of my aunt, clear as day. I instantly felt like throwing up and managed to get to my room without them seeing me. In there I pretty much collapsed, contemplated my existence and the utter fucked-up-ness of my family (I knew it was fucked up, but not like this) Then I just felt scared. I didn’t know what it meant. I knew it was wrong, very wrong, but not what to do about it. I was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. This what I meant by fucked up family). I just kind of panicked. 

So the next day, my aunt went to work and I knew she would be there late. When my mom came home, I instantly told her I needed to tell her something. I sat her down and told her exactly what I saw and heard and she went BALLISTIC. She stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. My aunt never came back. 

My brother is now very upset with me. He told me that they’re two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they weren’t hurting anybody and that it was never my business. He has all of his stuff packed and he’s planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. My mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. They all HATE my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. This made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. 

Now I’m stuck wondering if I made an asshole move by “telling” on them. My family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.

EDIT/UPDATE: My brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. I tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldn’t let her deal with this on her own. He also said he’s been in love with her since he was a kid. Before he left, he told me that he isn’t angry with me and apologized for being upset before. I told my mom he left and she had no reaction."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Anything bad she ever did made me feel guilty because I felt like if I had done a better job soothing her then she wouldn’t have gotten violent. Sarah never took responsibility for her actions, always blamed it on everyone else for being horrible to her, would cry about it and promise never to do that again when I called out, cycle repeats again in a week. 

  This went on for 5 years and it made my own mental health issues get worse. I tried distancing myself from her, but Sarah followed me everywhere and only ever wanted to talk with me all the time. It makes me nervous just remembering those days.

  Last year, I found out Sarah was insulting my other friends behind my back. It finally sunk in that she was bad for me. I drafted a letter and gave it to her. In it I expressed my disappointment with her actions over the years, told her how I was ending this friendship, and wanted no more contact with her out of respect for my mental health. Surprisingly, Sarah did not get violent and stopped following me everywhere while keeping to herself. In the next almost 2 years, my life has improved greatly.

The Situation: My school went to the museum for a field trip a few days ago. We were split into groups and the one I was in had most of my friends. Then I noticed Sarah was there, hanging around in the corner. I instantly got nervous, but didn’t want to make a fuss so I just ignored her and tried to keep talking with my friends. I wanted to believe she wouldn’t try something, but I was wrong.

  For the rest of our visit, Sarah kept trying to get close to me and find opportunities to talk with me. I heard her say hi, but kept ignoring her because she knows I want nothing to do with her. Sarah even kept trying to talk with my friends as an excuse to butt into conversations I was in, but I would just shut up until she left or go on my phone. The whole trip she kept trying to make charged comments to start debates during activity discussions hoping I would speak up to disagree with her. As badly as I wanted to yell at her to stop this, I held my tongue.

  Sarah didn’t give up until we finally headed back to the buses. I made sure to tell my friends everything about this as soon as we were back at school and they assured me I did the right thing. However when I was telling my sister about the incident, my mother said that I needed to quit be so hung over Sarah after all this time and just forgive her to make things easier for everyone. I told my mom that I have already moved on from the pain her actions caused me, but that didn’t mean I had to forget about them or forgive her. So AITA for not forgiving Sarah?"

"        My girlfriend has been placed in the hospital for well over 3 weeks due to a rare disease called chrons. It has swollen her intestines to where only liquid could pass through. This made it really hard for her to eat solids, and it still is. Even today if she tried to eat a solid, she would either be in extreme pain or puking it up. 

       My mom and I had planned to see her yesterday and she wanted to get cookies. I said it was a very bad idea because My GF can’t eat cookies. It seemed like she wanted to make it more about the parents, than my GF. After all it was my GF who was hospitalized, not them.

       I’m not saying it was a bad gesture, it just had merely bad timing. My GF could had not been able to eat solids for weeks now and had always reminded me of how starving she was. So I saw it as an extremely poor choice on my mother’s part to waltz into her room and give my GF’s mom cookies. She had before this, promised me my GF would not find out. 

      I had suggested that she waits until she can eat as well, so you could get two birds with one stone. She still would not listen to me. Prior to this, when my mom was getting the cookies, I told her it was a “f****** stupid idea”. Even my grandma seemed to agree. 

      However I’ve never been a parent, so of course I don’t know how my gfs mom might feel. I thought I was being considerate but my mom thinks I was an asshole. So, reddit, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	167.0	52.0	0.0	0.0

bypa1x	2019-06-09 21:20:36	UncleDevitio00	AITA For not going to a party?	"I am currently a male sophomore at university. During sophomore year of high school I met a girl, Sarah. We became good friends. She also introduced me to a guy a year below us named Adam. Adam quickly became one of my best friends and I enjoyed spending time with both of them.

Throughout sophomore year I began to develop feelings for Sarah. She was the first person I ever had a really big crush on in high school. But Sarah had a boyfriend at the time, so I backed off. 

Eventually however, she was single. In response I tried to get closer to her but I didn’t express my feelings. During these times she would occasionally be weirdly dismissive toward me.

For example, I would take her to a dance and she would agree, but she would completely ignore me the whole time. She would agree to go on a date-like hangout but ask me to not post anything about it. I tried to just give up and stop talking to her, but she would always assure me that she really enjoyed spending time with me.

This continued until Senior year of high school when she told me that she would never date me because she wouldn’t want to risk our friendship. I respected her decision and actually tried to leave her alone, but she didn’t want that.

After graduating high school and going to University, I decided to try to distance myself from Sarah and meet new people. However, Sarah would call me almost every night to inform me of her issues she was having with guys and that stuff.

This confused me as she knew I had feelings for her, but it felt like she was rubbing it in my face that I couldn’t date her by talking about relationship issues. But I tried to be understanding and explained to her that I wasn’t really over her and that talking to me about guys made me feel sad. I understand you should be able to talk to friends about that stuff, but I was ready to stop being friends with her since I couldn’t provide that service.

Sarah took it well and still wanted to be friends with me. I was okay with this until she asked me if I thought she should fuck a guy she was talking to. 

That was my limit, I went to a therapist and explained my situation to them, and they said I should cut off my relationship with Sarah and that she was keeping me around for affirmation, so I did. She was very understanding and told me to take all the time I need.

Now, Adam is graduating high school and is having a graduation party. He invited me... and Sarah. I would never make him choose between his friends so I politely declined the invitation and suggested that we could hang out some other time. But he called me a pussy for being “afraid” of Sarah and that I should just go. And he showed me that he was texting Sarah and she wants me to “get the fuck over it for a couple hours.”

So, I obviously could go and ignore her, but seeing her there would ruin the whole experience for me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"My father is a gardener, we have a  horticulture where we sell flowers. My father made the whole thing by himself, expanded the shop and etc. For him it is really much more work than watering the plants. He has to tell our employees what to do ( obviously ), buy the soil for the plants, water that, ship the plants and I admit, a lot more.

Now i understand he works a lot. Problem is he is acting entitled to everyone in the family because he works. I mean if he does not want to do something he always comes with ,,i work my ass off, you do that"". If he gets into an argument, this is his get out of jail for free card.

 He also expects me ( I am 16 btw ) and my siblings to go out to the shop and help him with things. This is understandable, but he never really tells us if he needs help (and when we are there he just complains that we are slow, not doing it right and he assumes we know how to do everything), he just brings it up to us that we never do anything. Altough we study hard, have homework and tons of out of school activities. Now after 6-8 hours in school, 1-2 hours of homework and studying and extracurricular lessons do we really have to go gardening? 

Anyway, on to the topic. Yesterday I went to the kitchen ( while my father was there )checked the fridge, found nothing i wanted to eat so i closed it.
This is how it happened:
Him (jokingly i guess ): you have nothing to eat?
Me: Not really don't we have sausages?
Him : why dont you go out and buy some?
Me: ( jokingly ) well why dont you?
Him ( agressively ): Because i am not the one going to the store. You just lay, doing nothing here while i work.
I got frustrares by this as he always does this and gets angry, so i said come one, i do not care you work. 
He lost it about this, he said we do nothing and do not have respect for him and I can go to work in the summer ( which i was planning anyways... ) to try what it is like and if he didnt work i wouldnt have shit and that i couldnt even work for a week ( he was refring to previous summer, whem i worked for 2 days, but on day 3 i got sick and stopped. Now he acts like i for sick from working... but my stomach got so fucking sick that day, i couldnt eat a sandwhich for 2 months without having nausea.
So anyway, i told him he is not the only one working in this world and he shouldnt act like this. Didnt pay attention to what he said next, but he left.

My mother thinks i should apologise, but i am happy i finally told him how me and my siblings feel.
So was i too harsh here? Should i apologise, but tell him i was serious and he should stop with this?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	252.0	24.0	0.0	0.0

She is overweight, but doesn't acknowledge it and I think it is because of her weight that she crashes out sleeping on the sofa by 7/8pm each day and sleeps pretty much intimately until the early hours of the morning before getting up, going to bed, and waking up at around 6. This results in her being tired throughout the day.

I've offered multiple times for her to attend the gym with me and advised that if she just goes to her bed rather than trying to stretch out her days on the sofa she would feel more alert. Am I the asshole to continue to push this on her when she refuses to do either? As someone who is slightly overweight, I understand it's not nice to be told, but I care about her health and feel like if it is for anyone to be candid about her habits, then it is me."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Let's get started, I'm 15 years old and Male. I've been wanting to try weed for a while, but never did because a few of my friends didnt want me to. The one friend said he wouldn't stop being friends with me over it, (he had said he would cut ties with people for it. He has a good reason). So I was a go there. But the focus of the story 'Billy'. Billy at first was very against me getting high. But over time he started with the ""Dude, I literally could not give a fuck"" so I thought I would be fine doing it because whenever it came up he said he doesn't care. Last night I got high and send him a mirror selfie (it seemed like a good idea at the time). And now he won't say a word to me. So, Reddit, AITA for getting high when my friend said he didnt care?

Edit: clarification. After I came down i realized that it was a really stupid mistake to send the picture, it's not something i normally do and i had forgotten all about it. I had no intent to piss him off, nor did I think it would. In just wanted to talk with my buddy.

 I told him we didnt have a Jimmy kit, but we have every tool known to mankind, so probably have something that would work. however after looking, I couldnt find anything I tried to call him, but he didnt answer. I grabbed whatever I thought could work and headed over to where he was. 

I got there and called him, no answer again. After two minutes he texted me. I'm at  (insert bar title) playing in a tournament. I texted him ok I'm here. I then sat there for 15 minutes, no text back, no call, nothing. I realized the potential he was mid game and couldnt come out, that's why I waited that long. but i thought he could atleast text me something along the lines of ""hey I'm playing 5 more minutes"" but nothing, so I left. I thought about heading in there, but there would have been alot of people who know me through pool and with my social anxiety, no way was I walking in there, especially with how much extra of my time thatd waste, talking to people. 

as soon as I got home he started spam calling me, and texting me very upset. i told him I didnt have anything that would work, but I tried anyways. he feels that I put in zero effort. I understand him being mad....but am I the asshole?

I moved out as soon as I could and have done a decent job of distancing myself relatively from my parents. 

My job requires me to work long days so my sleep is really important to me and my sister knows this. 
 
Last night, around 2am, I get a call from my sister and she says that she snuck out of the house and she’s really drunk and at a party with a bunch of older people and she needs me to come pick her up and she gave me the address (which was about 45 minutes away). 

I worked this morning at 5am so there was no way I was getting up and picking her up and losing sleep. I told her that she should take responsibility and call our parents to come pick her up. She started pleading with me and crying and begging me to come get her but I told her to call either mom or dad. 

She kept yelling so I just hung up on her. I called my parents and told them where she was and she needed them to come get her. I didn’t think about it again and I fell back asleep. 

On my break this morning I get a call from my parents saying that my sister is grounded and had her phone taken away from her. They thanked me for calling them. 

I was talking to my coworker and she said that I was being a little harsh and that I should’ve gone to get her just this once to make sure she was safe. I responded that I called my parents to pick her up and it wasn’t my responsibility to bail her out of a party.

I was really sad about it because the ring is something special to me, so my boyfriend gave me a back up ring that his mom chose awhile back. This ring was one that wrapped around your finger and it was VERY delicate and hollow.

I told my my boyfriend I didn’t like it because I was scared it would break and bend easily, which it did. Some of the gold came off and now has a sharp metal  end which hurts me sometimes. Today I asked him for another , just a simple ring band so it would last but then he got mad. He said I am never grateful and when I don’t get what I want I throw a fit.

So since I can't find anyone to date irl, I just stick to edating. I know, it's far from perfect and has a pretty terrible image, but it definitely beats being lonely. There's this one guy I hit it off with, but he had just gotten out of a bad (similarly edating) relationship and didn't want to commit. We kinda just stayed lovey friends for a while, somewhere in between dating and not. I wasn't exactly comfortable with this, and didnt handle it as well as I could've (I got mad, said some stuff), so we agreed to just be totally platonic friends in order to get to know each other better for a while before dating. We continued to have problems, especially with him not making a huge effort to talk and me going through various busy periods. This surmounted to when he was going to prom with a group of friends. Which I had no problem with, I told him to have fun and (semi-jokingly) not drink the punch. Things starting going wrong when he said (on a group chat we were both in) someone asked him if he had a date, and he said he did. He also said, ""he was my ride, which was true, but he was also my date"". The guy who originally asked, however, said ""I just went with a group of friends"" and my at the time bf-in-waiting (his term, not mine) just said ""same"". So obviously confused, I went to go DM him about this. I'll attach the DMs below, but basically, he considered any ""two people eating and talking"" to be a date. I admitted I misunderstood him and apologizing for worrying him/seeming like I was mad, and he told me this wouldnt work out between us. I sort of guilt tripped him after that, which looking back absolutely wasn't the right thing to do. I think I just kinda spilled what I've been thinking for a while, which was a mistake. I think I also made a mistake by not focusing more on whether or not he was actually interested in that guy, but I'm still not sure if I was really in the wrong in my confrontation.

In my life I have had 3 major parties one for my 16th birthday one for my high school graduation and one last weekend for my college graduation. Last weekend I had my college graduation my parents gave me a choice between them taking me on a trip or having a party I picked the party because I throughly it would be a fun way to see all the people I cared about and who helped me graduate. My mom invited a lot of her friends my mom has a very important job and her friends also are important people. I didn’t care if they came and told my mom to invite them if she wanted to. The party happens all is good and 3 days later my mom told me I needed to write thank you cards. This was weird for a few reasons 1. I haven’t written thank you cards for any of the past parties and those were more formal events. 2. She knows I am fairly environmentally conscious and wouldn’t be a fan of unnecessarily wasting paper. 3. We both have awful handwriting and avoid writing unless necessary. I asked her why would we do this and she replied “because my friends expect them and they have been asking me if you got your gifts.” I have had a particularly busy week and haven’t gotten around to writing them and today she calls me telling me I need to write them. I never disagree with my mom until today where I told her I thought they were a waste and her friends shouldn’t feel entitled to them especially since no one who attended my other parties did. She said because these were her friends they were getting them and she didn’t raise me to be this way and she had failed as a mother to which I just rolled my eyes and told her that was enough.

&#x200B;

 

Context:  I'm in a friend group with a couple of people and one of them (I'll  call Cal) sometimes will stay up really late texting in the chat. I  don't do this because I like having a good sleep schedule.

So  I'm sitting at my computer watching youtube videos when I get a call  from Cal. I pick up the phone and I get an answer from somebody who  obviously isn't Cal because his voice is much deeper and threatening. He asks if I live with my grandma and I replied I don't and that I was  just staying with her at the time. He also said that I shouldn't text Cal at 3 in the morning and how would I like it if he texted my grandma that late. I realized that I probably shouldn't be giving out that kind  of information to a strange person who I've never met so I hung up on  them.

I got a text from Cal a little while later, he told me to take him off the group chat which was fine with me but also that it was disrespectful to hang up on him mid-conversation. I replied that I didn't have to talk with him and I don't want him calling me or my grandma. I also told him that it's not my fault he texts in the group chat that late and I've never texted in the chat that late, just him and my other friends.

I  told my other closer friend about all of this and he sided with me  saying that Cal's dad was definitely in the wrong and that's not cool  especially when I didn't do anything wrong.

I  agree with what my close friend said but I also understand that it is  disrespectful to hang up on people if they're still talking to you,  however he was being really aggressive and I didn't know who he was so I'm really confused. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

It was about 2-3 weeks ago. We’ve had sex a little more after that. Well. Recently in the past days I’ve experienced a lot of morning sickness and other symptoms of pregnancy. 
     I had tried to talk to my boyfriend about the possibilities and actual realistic consequences of I’m pregnant. However things didn’t go down to well. We both have some reproduction health issues. However we all know that there is still a slim chance. He has made me feel aweful about this and even suggested that I may of cheated if I was pregnant.  I was just worried. Neither of us wants kids right now but if I am pregnant I wouldn’t want to get rid of it (I don’t think) he’s expressed hostility towards me and the entire idea. And the way he’s reacted has made me feel as if he would resent me or even leave if I was pregnant. 
         So am I the asshole for being concerned? Any tips or advice will be helpful."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Edit 2: The reason he is toxic (or at least, the factors that I’ve been directly exposed to) is because me and my brother wanted to change the visit schedule to match with meeting friends, and he took it as, “Friends more important than family? Fuck you!”


Edit 3: a story of what he’s done. My uncle was diagnosed with Cancer just before a skiing holiday with him, my cousin (his son) and my cousin’s mate. My Dad took my Uncles spot on the holiday as he was in no way fit to go skiing for a week. My Dad ended up sending pictures, with captions such as, “shame you aren’t here,” and total BS such as, “we were going to take you as well, but you cancelled the visit,” Bitch. You. Never. Asked.

When I did it my mom thought it was really cool so she told my aunt. She started angrily texting me in the WhatsApp family group chat calling me a selfish child and that I should have shared it with my cousins or her. 

I told her it was expired and she basically laughed at me, called me ignorant, and said eyeshadows don’t expire. My mom is really pissed at her and now my aunt isn’t talking to either of us.

"I'm getting married soon, and my mom suggested that instead of buying a veil I should ask my aunt to make one for me. She made my mom's veil, and I thought if she was willing, it would be a beautiful family heirloom I could eventually pass down to my future daughter or DIL when they get married. Heck, I'd pass it to my future son if he were so inclined. I just thought a handmade veil made by a family member would be a sweet gesture. I asked, and made it clear I certainly wasn't expecting her to do it (it was up to her, no hard feelings if she declined) and I'd even pay for it if she'd like. She said she would and she didn't want me to pay. Then she went and bought a cheap veil off Amazon with daisies on it (my wedding is in fall, ffs) and wants to throw a couple rhinestones on it and call it good. I'm heartbroken. I had no problem buying my own veil, she could've declined my request, she could've even come to me after changing her mind and I would've understood. But I was under the impression I was getting a one of a kind veil and now I'm getting a $15 Amazon veil as ""her gift to me"". I don't like it and I don't want to wear it. My mom agrees that this was a bit of a low blow, but my dad (my aunt's brother) just shrugged it off. Neither of them want to address it as an issue, and I don't know how to use a different veil at the wedding without someone calling me an asshole for not wearing this ""gift""."

Over that time I'd realised that we were too different and that I wasn't happy. We split on relatively good terms, though she was upset at first. We kind of actively avoided each other for the next month. She never tried to start drama, never tried to bad-mouth me, and she never tried to approach me.

And then I came out as trans.
Most of my friends had already known I was gonna come out, but this was when I'd come out to my mum and basically anyone else who hadn't known. Literally the day after I came out, she came and tried to interact with me at lunch. She walked up to my lunch table, and when I'd walked away to throw something out, she'd sat in my seat. I sat down in an empty seat across the table, avoiding eye contact. After she left and I'd sat back in my seat, all my friends who were sitting around me asked about it, since she'd approached me before. I honestly had no clue. I had no interest in talking to her, much less her being around me and all my friends, because she doesn't ever shut up. I felt really uncomfortable with her imposing on me.
In all honesty I think she's only trying to act all buddy-buddy with me is because I came out.

So, a few weeks ago my first gf broke up with beacuse she had an issue going on with her family. Now, I took this pretty hard for several reasons. 1). I'd never put myself out there before due to insecurities and the sheer fact that I'm not out yet (am gay)  2.) I get attached to people super easily and told her her that 3.) We literally went from talking everyday all day for almost a month to her not being able to have a 5 min conversation. 

I could have gotten over the break up eventually, but the thing is it was hard to do when I couldn't talk about how I felt. There was one conversation where I asked about her side a little and why it had to happen and so forth. But I never got to say how I really felt and how it seemed like she just cut me off. It was just hard to believe that she could go out with friends and family and post things to her snapchat story but not be able to have a conversation about how I felt about everything. 

I will admit I might have been a little pushy. I made some posts to my private story (really, no one but her and a friend of mine could see it) about how I was feeling and she responded to that, but she only ever said one line sentences and it was like pulling teeth to get her to talk and I stopped the conversation when she did. Fast forward to me trying one last time to tell her how I feel so I could move on, she claimed she couldn't do this anymore and blocked me. And instagram, being the lovely app that it is, recommended her spam account to me and so I apologized for being pushy and she blocked me from that without saying a word. I tried to put her first. I really did. I'm new at this and I cared about her. A lot. But it doesn't seem fair that I couldn't get my point across. And yet I still feel like a jerk for pushing her to talk to me."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"(Apologize if my English is bad) I rented a utility trailer to get dirt from someone. Unloaded it almost completely but the manure was stuck in the grooves of the trailer bed. I tried scraping it out and also tried hosing it but I don’t have a pressure washer. Hosing made it worse. A sign on the trailer said $15 if I return it unclean. I thought I’ll return it and save $40 instead of $15. The guy working there was very mad and said he would charge me $75 which isn’t written anywhere and another guy that works with him told me that they can charger whatever they like if the equipment is dirty. I did not buy that. I said you can’t since it’s not written anywhere. After arguing for a little bit he unhooked the trailer from my car and ran to the office and got my Receipt. Upon looking in the receipt I found they hadn’t charged me anything for cleaning. I tried handing him a $5 tip and he denied it. The whole drive back home I felt bad about what I did.

Update: I got an email a couple of hours ago with a new receipt and it has $75 cleaning fee included. I’ll be talking to them.

She was FURIOUS.

She told me I am abusing the animal, and shouldn’t be punished, but should be put in his cage for a minute. I say no because I don’t want him to view his cage (which I put him in at night) as a punishment. The argument escalates to the point where my parents get involved.

He recently posted a video on his Instagram where I could see the card clearly. It was not first edition. 
I rewatched the video several times to make sure I saw it correctly. Unfortunately, it was clear that this card was not actually first edition. This means the card is only worth about $12 in good condition.
I saw Ken the next day and joked about the card not being first edition, thinking he'd say something like ""oh I didn't know that"". However, he insisted that the card was first edition. I was going to break it to him by sending him pictures of actual first edition cards, but I stopped myself. I feel like if knew the truth about the card it would make him upset, plus I found no gain in telling him.

We like to play video games, watch anime, and get collectibles together, but there's one issue that's been coming up lately: his money management skills aren't very good. I mentioned him in another AITA post where he wanted to borrow money for new figurines, which you can read about in more detail here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/asuze9/aita\_for\_no\_longer\_helping\_my\_friend\_buy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/asuze9/aita_for_no_longer_helping_my_friend_buy/) 

He called me again today asking if I could contribute about $50 to a birthday gift for his friend (total price for the gift was about $150) and said he could pay me back in a couple days. I tried telling him no but he was pretty persistent, insisting that this was the only gift his friend could possibly want. I told him from now on, I don't want to lend him any money unless it's for something absolutely necessary for him (ex. Rent/bills). He seemed a bit offended when we hung up the phone. 

Individually, I wouldn't see either of these instances as reasons to end a friendship. However, I don't want this to become a pattern.

So my partner (27 M) and I (25 F) work in theatre and are currently doing a show in Philadelphia. He was talking to his parents on the phone a week or so before the show officially opened and asked if they wanted to come see it. And they freak out on him for not giving them enough notice and being irresponsible (which was a lie I know he told them and I even mentioned the dates to them...) He didn’t mind that they couldn’t make it seeing as it’s a long-ish run and we do shows all the time so they can just see the next one. But his parents offered to fly his 23 year old sister to us to see they show. We were excited because we like spending time with her and said yes and we needed to check to see which days would be best. Partner and I talked and decided the best dates and when we call his mother she told us she already got plane tickets and they dates were decided. Sister was coming the next day (!!) and staying for 5 days. This was very inconvenient for us seeing as we had work every single one of those days and had to be out of the house for like 6 hours each day. I am also very upset because my 26th birthday is one of the days she will be here and I had to cancel my plans to entertain her. When my partner confronted his mother about this she didn’t say sorry or even acknowledge that it was a mistake to not check with us first. Basically her response was “the tickets are bought so deal with it”
So WIBTA if I texted her after the visit and told her that while we appreciated the visit and the time spend with the sister it was very unfair to tell us when she was coming and that it can’t happen again.

4 people involved: Kaya, Jane, Amy and myself.

Jane and Kaya are sisters, Amy is Kaya’s best friend but she wasn't able to attend the party. Jane has a drinking problem, everyone has known this for years but everyone ignores it. We’ve been friends since high school and are now in our late 20s – I’ve distanced myself from them and we only see each other once a year. I was invited to Kaya’s birthday party and was hesitant to go but decided to give it a chance.

At the party, Jane is completely blasted. She doesn’t have cocaine to even her out so she’s drunker than I’ve ever seen her. Things are ok despite Jane being really loud and borderline incomprehensible from slurring. Jane and I are catching up and she grabs my arm to see my new, still healing, tattoo. I pull her hand off and say, “oh it’s still healing, I’m not supposed to touch it”. Jane laughs maniacally and grabs my arm again aggressively and twists it to see the tattoo. I rip my arm out of her hand and say, “JANE STOP”

Everyone comes into the bedroom where we were hanging out and Kaya says to Jane, ""okay Jane you really need to cut yourself off right now.""

Jane loses. her. mind. I've never seen her like this. She starts screaming at Kaya, telling her to fuck off, not to tell her what to do. Kaya screams back and eventually things get physical and Jane starts assaulting Kaya. Now they're sisters so Kaya fights back and they're wrestling on the ground while other partygoers are trying to intervene.

Meanwhile, I'm cowering in the corner because honestly, I'm 28 years old and I'm not about to get involved in a fucking fistfight. I work with the homeless at a shelter and Kaya's boyfriend is trying to wrangle them apart, and looks at me and goes, ""why aren't you doing anything? Didn't they train you to intervene when shit goes down like this?""

No????

I don't know what came over me because I am not the kind of person to whip out a phone and start filming, but honestly I was so shocked and appalled at Jane's behaviour but most of all concerned. If this is where things have gotten to then she is in serious trouble. I started filming the fight. I sent it to Amy and said, ""look, I'm not sending this to you to start drama, I just need you to see what happened tonight. I'm really worried about Jane. She needs help. You're her best friend and I hope that you can show her this and she can see what everyone sees""

Amy thanked me for sending her the video but now it's months later and everyone is just back to the way things were. I knew this might happen, everyone wants to turn a blind eye and at the end of the day, if Jane doesn't see a problem then no one can do anything. I'm at peace with that.

byodzy	2019-06-09 20:01:13		AITAH for telling my friend I don't want him driving my car?	"My friend and I took a trip the week, used my car, but split driving duties.

Unfortunately, my friend's driving irked me. Here would constantly speed up and brake in smooth traffic to maintain a constant speed, would slam on his breaks in curves, then speed into the next one before slamming again, and would constantly speed up and slam on the brakes to avoid hitting people on the freeway. He also swerved a lot and used only his index finger for wide turns with almost scary results.

I didn't say anything because I was just grateful not to take a break.

Then he swerved to avoid hitting a guy at the last second without braking and then almost didn't stop in time to hit the car in the other lane. I had to yell at him to stop speeding up and brake. He just complained about idiots stopping on the freeway. 5 minutes later he nearly hit someone at a red light because thought they weren't stopped until the last second.



We left to go home today, but I told him I didn't want him driving my car anymore. I said ""sorry, but you're drinking too carelessly to trust you with my car.""

He started pouting really badly saying that he was only trying to help. I said I was grateful he offered, but I didn't like how he came close to wrecking my car twice. He just said fine. He's been sulking the entire morning and refuses to speak to me, and just sits pouting in the car.

I've been trying to keep the conversation up and lively, but he's been less than forthcoming. I don't want to start a grudge between us, and honestly if we were in his car, I probably would have just said ""be more careful, I don't want to get in an accident."" I just feel bad for how it's played out and want to apologise for being so blunt, but I feel like it's going to put a permanent strain on us.

TL;DR - Told my friend I didn't want him driving my car because he nearly hit two cars and drives carelessly, he's been pouting all day now."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"This behavior makes me kind of uncomfortable because it makes me remind about when she didn’t have a vehicle so i did use mine(car with some mechanical problems)and NEVER asked for gas no matter how long the trip will be or even risking the car of breaking down mid road just to make her “happy” and now that she have a car i need to pay gas and many times i need to pay food for both.

a week it’s like 50$ or more that i need to give her to just spend time together, i’m in a catastrophic economic situation and since i just begun to stop sacrificing the little money we haven’t take a ride for almost 2-3 weeks.

It’s not a problem to give her time to time money for gas because the car doesn’t use love or whatever to run, but giving her money EVERY-TIME we go out knowing my economic situation it’s a bit off.

She and her mother have decided to not invite them to the small BBQ we are having afterwards. Im white my, wife is black Ive been with my wife for 15 years, 10 dating sonce 18, last 5 married my family and hers has never treated us badly regardless of how some of them may have felt. Anyway our daughters Baptism is coming up I have a large Italian family and I honestly dont want all of them at the celebration its too many (just my aunts uncles and cousins gets us to 50 ppl) and I just dont want all of  them around. So I decided to invite only my aunts and unlces and a few friends. My wife and her mother although are ok with their side attending the church dont want them at the BBQ afterwards. Its her family so I dont get involved but I did say it was rude. They were generous for our wedding and at my wifes baby shower. But my wife and MIL hold grudges on slights that are rude but they hold them for decades some examples:

Aunt that MIL lives with- Wouldnt drive MIL to a funeral they were both attending.

Uncle Had Thanksgiving at his place. This uncle drove another Aunt who lived far away to her place. My MIL and wife (then GF ) lived close but still quite a distance away from this aunt. Uncle made them drive this Aunt home. They were pissed because they felt it was Uncles responsibility to do so.

Another Aunt- Never told them about some family memebers who passed away.

Theres other stuff too that I call just rude behavior by them that my wife and MIL wont forgive them for. Like I said its her family and she can decide who to invite and exclude but is my wife the asshole for excluding family who has been supportive and generous with us?"

byoayj	2019-06-09 19:53:41	KindBeginning	AITA for not wanting to celebrate my dad on Father's Day?	"Hi,

I've been conflicted about this and I don't know if I should be.

My dad and I have always had a good relationship up until maybe a couple years back and it really went downhill this year. For the record, I'm 30F, married, with a kid.

Ok, so you'll probably tell me this sounds like a personal situation, and it is, but I guess what I'm getting at is, am I a petty asshole for reacting this way given the circumstances or is this justified? Back in December he did some pretty fucked up shit. My department shut down and I lost my job without any notice, and he offered to babysit my then 5 month old while I went out and put in applications and went to interviews.

Very generous, right? Well, here's where it gets screwy. I was pretty depressed and anxious at the time and was trying to keep it together, but it was difficult to do so around him all the time and I'd occasionally start crying or talk about how hopeless I felt and how I was scared I wouldn't find another job. It sucked not knowing how things were going to pan out especially with a new baby. After offering support to my face, I later found out he was turning around and taking pictures of the inside of my fridge and texting it to family members and commenting about how I'm too lazy to cook. Texting about how I don't know how to bathe the kid properly, how I'm a fucking irritating broken record about the job, etc. He even went through my antidepressants and counted them like I'm some sort of child. Really the only reason I found out about all this is because my aunt showed me the texts and said he's been telling everyone about my personal life and mental health situation and warned me not to be so open with him.

I was honestly crushed. It was definitely up there in the top 3 most difficult and stressful times in my life and I had someone masquerading as supportive and instead going behind my back and doing the complete opposite. I went from trusting him 100% to basically 0%.

I guess our relationship has been pretty nonexistent lately, he might send a text once a week or two asking ""how's the kid"" and I go ""good"" and that's about it. In previous years I usually went out and got him a card and a little gift, but this year, I'm honestly thinking about just sending a ""happy father's day"" text or saying ""fuck it"" to the entire thing.

Am I the asshole if I decide to go half-assed on father's day this year, or even skip the whole thing altogether? Like I said, our relationship used to be good, and I know this may come off as petty but it feels so maddening celebrating someone who was a complete douche to me this year just because I'm expected to."

byo9i0	2019-06-09 19:50:03	rhaxor72	AITA for not wanting my sister-in-law to visit her own home?	"  

For context, my girlfriend and I live in a duplex that we rent from her SIL (who we'll call Jamie) who lives in a different city. She originally bought the house because she was going to move there with her kids and husband (who is my girlfriend's brother. Also we'll call him Mark), but after Mark got a better job in their home town, they decided to cancel the move and just buy another house in their hometown instead. Now they are left with a duplex and that is where my girlfriend and I are staying now.  Now the issue is, Jamie and Mark want to bring their kids on a vacation, and seeing that they have a duplex here, they want to stay in there in order to save money. 

Now, I know this doesn't sound that bad, but let me give you some info about these guys. First, they are lazy. For example, neither one of them wants to drive anywhere. Jaime can't drive because she doesn't have a license, even though she's a stay at home mom and has all the time in the world to study and practice to get one. Mark has a CDL even, but whenever he visits he says he ""doesn't know the roads well enough"" and asks my girlfriend to drive him everywhere. 

Second, they like to put their responsibilities on everyone else. Whenever they visit, Mark and Jamie always like to go out for 6 hours a day, leaving us to cook for and take care of the kids for the majority of what little free time we have. Even when they are home, they almost expect us to cook for them. They love to eat rice but they never make it, so when it's almost dinner time they're always like ""Oh, we want rice but there's none left, can you make some?"" 

Third, they don’t even control their kid’s bedtime, so the kids are up until 1am, and start making noise again at 6am (they take naps around 5pm). This really does not work with my girlfriend’s or my work schedule, since I’m taking classes and work fulltime and my girlfriend works 10 hours a day.

And lastly, they are just infuriatingly unreasonable. If they want something, they go get it no matter what, and never compromise. Once they wanted to go to an Asian buffet that was 2 cities over, and we had to drive them for 30 minutes to get them there, even though there's like 15 Asian buffets in my city that are exactly like it.

My girlfriend and I have both talked about it, and we absolutely do not want them to visit because of how much stress they cause us. But, this also kind of makes me feel like an asshole because while they are a nuisance, they do help us out with the cheaper rent. Normally we would have to pay about $550-600/month, but because we take care of the place, they dropped it down to $400-450 for us. This includes lawn care, maintenance, and finding people to rent the other side of the duplex. Another thing is that there is still one room open for them to use, so there is enough space for them to be here, although it will be a little cramped. 

So reddit, are my girlfriend and I assholes for not wanting them here?

byo8zo	2019-06-09 19:48:50		AITA for wanting my SIL to move out?	"Ok so for some set up, about 4 months ago my fiancée’s sister moved in with us. We had just evicted our old roommate for being gross and inconsiderate and loud and obnoxious. Her sister was living in kind of a sketchy situation and she started to feel unsafe. So we had an extra room and a desire for somebody to pick up the old roommates portion of the bills around the house. So the stage was set for her to move in. 

I personally had some reservations about her moving in with us. I was particularly uninterested in having another roommate after the last one went the way it did. Also, I know the dynamic of living with siblings and I wasn’t particularly interested in having to deal with my fiancée dealing with her sister.  That being said, I was kind of overruled (their mom owns the house we rent, but the intent is to eventually purchase the house from her) and she moved in. So I pushed for a roommate agreement. Something to outline the rules of living in our house. This includes things like: clean up after yourself, if your dog destroys something you need to replace it, after 10:00 PM you need to turn the volume down, and other general, common sense rules to avoid the issues we had with our old roommate and to prevent new issues that could arise. Also, I was told that her moving in was definitely a temporary thing because she planned on finding a place to move to when her boyfriend eventually moved over to where we live. She signed the agreement and I felt more comfortable with her moving in. 

Fast forward to now and she has broken EVERY thing in the agreement she signed and I’m absolutely at my last straw with her. She’s loud, unbelievably annoying, messy, lazy and she’s rude. We ask her for help cleaning up the house and she refuses because “it’s not my job to clean up” even though she contributes to the mess. She eats the groceries we buy even though she doesn’t contribute to the grocery runs. Her dog has destroyed stuff that she’s refused to pay for because “mom said I don’t have to.” And she sings Japanese karaoke (she’s the whitest type of white you can be) at all times of the day and night. Also, it sounds like her boyfriend moving is being delayed for some reason, meaning the “few months” that she was going to be living with us could end up being extended. 

So I vent some of my frustration to my now wife and I’m being told that I need to calm down and I need to stop complaining about her sister. So am I the asshole here?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byo5bz	2019-06-09 19:39:37		AITA for despising our neighbours	"Tell me. Am I the asshole? 

So me and my boyfriend have lived in our flat for a while now and we pay a lot of money to live with a secure close so we have security for our two beloved indoor cats (who like to run out the front door every so often). I would be distraught if anything happened to them. 

Our neighbours who don't work due to being on benefits have multiple dogs, wedge our shared back door open and block access to the door so no one can get out to our shared garden. They let their dogs run in and out of their flat through the close. 
Several times we have come in the close and their dogs have leaped over the barrier and jumped up on us. They're not small dogs and they just laugh about it. They have also tried to barge into our flat and nothing was said. 
Every time I come in and see the door open I have to go close it just in case our cats try escape when we open our door.

The neighbours also like to stay up late in the garden being extremely loud or doing 'DIY' constantly hammering all the time. They shout at their dogs so loud it has woken me up before. 

We no longer go in our garden because it is covered in dog poop and our washing line has also been removed, we assume by the same people as no one else goes outside because of them. The one time we did leave washing out to dry it was torn down and soiled by their dogs. 

They've also been tormenting our cats at the windows by power washing them while they were sleeping on their window bed. They didn't realise my boyfriends parents were in at the time. Our cats hate them and run and hide when they here them in the close.

We asked them nicely to keep the door closed for security reasons and we got our heads bitten off and said we were the problem because the front door occasionally blows open if not shut properly. (Bearing in mind there are 6 other flats in our building)

I can't stand it anymore but I love our little flat so much. I'm so frustrated.

So yesterday my girlfriend (GF) texted me letting me know she was going to the Pride Parade in WeHo with her friend Rich. This was around 6 PM, when I was getting off of work. I texted telling her to have a great time and I'd see her when she got home. We exchanged mushy emojis and all is good. I don't like to complain about my schedule or commute to and from work, but I do think it's worth mentioning here. I drive an average of 70 miles (~112km) for work. I've also been covering for a co-worker who is on vacation so I've picked up extra shifts. I'm pretty low on gas and all I want to do is get home, shower, eat and sleep. I also gotta do it all again the next day.

I arrive home to see GF's car is still parked out front, but figured Rich probably drove them out to WeHo. I get upstairs, shower, eat and I'm in the bed by 9. Around 9:45 my GF texts me saying she is tipsy and on her way to a house party. I responded asking where, and if she was still with Rich. She sends me her location on gmaps (16 miles / 25km from our place) when she gets there and says Rich wasn't driving her friend Jen was and they are all together. I ask how long she plans on being out and she says she doesn't know. Then I ask how's she was getting home and she then tells me I needed to come get her.

Guys, I was exhausted. I asked if Jen could bring her back and she said yes, but she didn't want to wait for her and felt uncomfortable. Then I said this:

*Babe, honestly it's late and I'm tired and I don't got the gas nor the energy to drive out there right now. You really can't wait for her to bring you home?*

That's the text exactly as I type it. I was really hoping she would understand and not be upset. She texts, back ""Wow... I'll take a Lyft"". Yup, she's upset. I hate dealing with disagreements over text so I try calling her. No answer. Back to texting. I tell her I know she is upset but I hope she can understand my situation, she replies ""okay"".

I knew when she got home because she turned the TV on and turned the volume pretty loud. I'm not sure, but I think she may have done that out of spite. This morning I obviously got the silent treatment and when I'm ready to leave for work and go to try and kiss her, she pulls back. On my drive to work I call her to let her know I'm checking on her and she says she's fine and hung up on me. About ten mins later I get a text from her saying she has never been this disappointed in me and there is no excuse for what I've done. I tell her I don't want to have this discussion over text and we'll talk when I get home.

I need to know if I'm being an asshole here. Should I have just sucked it up and went to pick her up, or is she making this out to be more than it is?

"This was a few years ago, but I haven’t felt the same since so I had to come here for honest opinions. Burner account because my teammates know my main. I will not disclose the sport because I don’t want people to know my identity.

Everyone is calling me a snake. I was just doing what was best for my career and my happiness. I had spent years competing at the highest level with my old teammate in a small market trying my best to win a championship, it just never panned out.

Ownership was giving me the feeling that they preferred my teammate over me and our games just didn’t mesh well enough to win a title. I could tell that if we didn’t win a championship yet, we were never going to win one together.

I wanted to change things up and go somewhere where I would be happy, where ball movement was a priority. Somewhere my teammates would understand the value I bring and give me the ball when they knew I could get the job done. I wanted to play with people who were unselfish, who understood team sports.  

I do not think I am the asshole for making a decision that was best for my happiness and my career. I think I have proven that I can dominate at the highest stage and that the team I joined needed me to win a championship. 

Everyone is giving me so much crap I feel like I need to leave my current team again to prove I can win on my own. 

The one thing I wish I did differently was be honest with my former teammate, and tell him in advance the decision I was going to make. He didn’t deserve to find out I was leaving through social media like everyone else.

So in April, the administration at my school decided to switch to an A/B lunch, because of a few fights. Previously, lunch was 40 minutes. And people could use that time to eat, socialize with their friends, make up tests and stuff, and get help from teachers. However, this new lunch schedule did not bode well with the students, and one student had the bright idea to start a petition to bring the old lunch schedule back on change.org. Over 600 students signed the petition (which is basically half the school), and many put up protest posters in the halls (I was the main one doing this). One student even typed a letter to the administration voicing her opinions. The general opinion was that we thought it was unfair to punish the whole school just because of the actions of a few students. 

The A/B lunch split up some friend groups, and also there was less time for students to catch up on assignments and tests and stuff.

Their relationship wasn't that great, but he was sad that the relationship ended (because of some happy moments) but he did say that it was necessary and that he needed to find someone of his own intellectual level (he didn't think she was too bright). My brother is very smart and finished college a year earlier.

As me and my family were comforting him, he stated that he mainly felt bad because she will never find anyone like him. I told him that she can still find a guy like him that will stay will her and be happy with her, and that he shouldn't worry. He then said that that was false and that he's unique. Again, I tried to tell him that it's still very possible for her to find a guy that could make her happy, whether he's like my brother or not. He then asked me to name anyone ""like him"". I did't know what ""like him"" meant so I started naming my friends who are smart computer science majors like he is. He said I was missing the point. My dad chimed in and asked if I considered my old friend who came from a unwell-adjusted family and who's dad got arrested for growing weed and who's an athlete was ""better"" than my brother. I was about to say that you can't really compare people like that and say that one person is just completely ""better"" than other, but my brother interrupted and correctly guessed that I was going to say that and said to just drop the conversation.

"I decided to leave my friend group and basically ghost all of them a few weeks after high school graduation. My reasoning for this is because pretty much all their life’s revolve around is smoking and partying, mainly smoking, I used to smoke too since 7th grade but about 2 months ago I decided I needed to cut my shit and stop, realizing I can’t make it through college or do anything in life when all I do is smoke like 4-5 times a day, and that it severely held me back in high school. Ever since I stopped smoking I haven’t hung out with them anymore as all they do is get together and smoke and I find it extremely boring to just sit there on my phone and deal with a bunch of fucked up people. Also I’ve been realizing that once I stopped smoking I don’t really enjoy the company from about half of them, they are bad influences and don’t have there head in the right spot thinking they can make it rapping or not going to college to pursue jackass careers, plus some of them are so ignorant to the point where I use words like perspective they react with “bro your a tenuous what are you even saying”. So I just decided to leave the group chat delete my social and cut them off completely.

1) We arrived and decided to sit outside we thought it was odd but okay. We sat there for half an hour and then some other costumer came to tell us that we couldn’t sit outside that they weren’t serving there so we went inside. No staff came to tell is but that wasn’t such a big deal at first.

2) we ordered right away bc we already spend half an hour just sitting there. We waited 3 hours for our food... after like 1h30-2h we started to get mad (we asked for 2 spaghettis and 2 steaks so not that hard to cook) and people around us started telling how long they had been waiting,... right when we were talking to an other table a couple complained that they had been waiting half an hour and like 15 minutes later they got their food... whilst we had been waiting longer.

3) we finally get 2 plates and we are so happy so my friends start eating while i and my bf wait for our food... we got our food 40 minutes later then our friends?! I was pissed.

4) we asked the bill but AGAIN we waited 30min and no bill came. Our whole day was gone, we were mad and decided to just take off, other costumers told us we should do it so we went without paying...

I went over to r/debateanatheist because I heard it wasn’t as bad as r/atheism. I saw many religious people getting mass downvotes so I created a post asking why that was. Most people gave me legitimate reasons and they were nice. Others weren’t as good. This one guy called all religious people mentally ill (including his wife) and another guy started laughing at my question and clearly tried to pick a fight. 

What I am primarily wondering however, is how I acted in a particular argument. A user claimed the majority of the sub was atheist which I agreed and stated I’ve seen polls saying Reddit is 2/3 atheist. I posted one when asked for a source. This one guy then purposely commit voter fraud on that poll to prove a point. That’s when I asked him how he could possibly enjoy life with that much skepticism. He took that as a personal attack which I didn’t intend it to be. He then started criticizing me to which I called him toxic. He called me a hypocritical toxic a hole. I apologized for calling him toxic. I realized I messed up. He didn’t care and continued to argue with me before I stated I could not continue to fight hate with hate and instead fight it with love so I wished him a good life. 

Please look at my argument and help me determine who is in the wrong

She usually calls me over to help her and I can't say no or else the yelling starts right away, but very rarely does it end peacefully. If I can't act like I'm not there, I usually bite my tongue and deal with it but if my anxiety is too much I just leave.

As the title says... but background. My boyfriends exwife is remarried and she and her new husband live in a house with a pool that has no fence or cover. My boyfriend has repeatedly told her about the dangers of this. We also know that the 12 year old step sister is charged with babysitting them while they are at work, which includes swimming. I think this is a dangerous situation, especially knowing his kids swimming ability is not strong and drownings can happen quickly. He knows nothing of me contemplating this. I severely worry for the kids. I hear of other incidents of neglect, like the daughter being forgotten on the first say of school and not picked up, and the 5 year old getting lost at a Halloween party and kind strangers ensured she made it back to her parents, putting the family on a strict ""all-bacon"" diet, the girls not having properly fitting shoes (too small) and other things. I respect that parenting is difficult and messy along with the fact that the girls may exaggerate to their dad about some things. My real worry is that pool. 
But I do not want the mother to blame my boyfriend and make things worse for his daughters because they have to live with her half the time. 
I keel thinking that I dont want to get invovled, but at the same time I know personally a child who drowned at the age of 7, and as its summertime, drowning are happening every week around the metropolitan area I live in. I cant help but think I am an asshole for reporting, but what if one of them gets hurts? Am i an asshole for not reporting?? 
My bf and the mother do not have a good relationship as it is, which already hurts the kids because they dont even have an agreed upon bedtime. Its very sad and a mess but I believe their lives could be in danger. My bf says he made the children promise not to swim when being babysat by the 12 year old but theyre just kids and I dont think thats enough to ensure safety. Help me reddit!"

I told him locking me out of the car at the grocery store and slowing driving while making me walk next to the car could also be considered “too far” but we do this stuff to each other all the time.

"Hey all, I have been living with my sister for about 3 years and I have owned my dog(G) for little over a year. Recently she started to dog sit a friends dog(P) who is around 10 years old. They are both roughly the same size but my dog is a little bigger. G is only one year old and will get too close to other dog's faces, so understandably I assumed P would tell him to back off with a bark. Instead P attack G and I had to intervene while my sister was occupied with something else instead of watching P. I got mad at my sister for not even watching P and even blaming my dog for getting bit. All I asked for was a sorry which she laughed off and said she refused to, and want to ""set boundaries"" for me. Since she still refuses to even say sorry to me or my dog, and says I am being dramatic I had to ask AITA?

EDIT: Thanks again for all the responses, I now understand I was an asshole in this scenerio and will do more research.

bynrav	2019-06-09 19:05:32	damelavenganza	AITA for never letting my brother watch my dog again?	"I left on a weekend trip and asked my brother to house and dog sit for me. I left clear instructions for feeding, exercise, and temperature control for my dog along with very clear instructions that I was to be unavailable by phone and if an emergency happened to call my partner who had cell service (though he was with me 10 hours away). My dog is 12 years old and a large breed, so she is pretty old and I wanted to safeguard against potential issues like overheating.

I left cell service for a day and when I got back, there was a text from my brother. He had texted me 12 hours previously saying there was a problem with my dog, that she wasn’t doing well and couldn’t really walk. He did not text anyone else. He did not call anyone including a vet. He did not contact my partner at all, despite clear instructions. He texted me and went to bed. He did not take her into the vet until after I called him and told him to - 12 hours after he texted me. The symptoms he listed sounded serious (disorientation, difficulty walking, no appetite, sudden onset). 

My dog is fine. She has an inner ear issue that was throwing her off balance so she couldn’t walk and was too nauseated to eat. But we only learned she was fine after the vet. If it had been heat exhaustion or something more serious she could have died or needed a significant amount more treatment. I’m not convinced he would have taken her to the vet. 

My family says that I should appreciate that he watched her at all and that nothing bad happened so I shouldn’t be mad at him for doing what he thought was right. They think I’m an asshole for being upset that he neither contacted us appropriately when the issue arose nor sought treatment for her. They think I’m overreacting and everything is fine. 

So am I overreacting? Would I be the asshole for telling my brother he has very poor judgment and I no longer trust him with my dog? Would I be the asshole for yelling at him for a complete disregard for my dog’s health?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	754.0	79.0	0.0	0.0

bynoy7	2019-06-09 18:59:43	TinktheChi	AITA for not wanting to have a friendship with my late best friend's parents	"My best friend and I were 13 months apart in age.  We met when I was 5 and she was 4 and we were inseparable. 
My friend was a figure skater.  She loved skating and practiced every morning before school.  She didn't want to compete and ended up travelling with a sort of Ice Capades show when she was 17.
Backtrack to our young childhoods.  Her parents beat her and generally treated her badly.  She had a younger brother who no matter how outrageous his actions, could do no wrong.  My friend tried so hard to make her parents happy but couldn't.  
Her mother was 16 when she got pregnant with my friend and 18 when she had her son.
Her mother was quite overbearing.  Her father always thought he was quite funny, but I recall being embarrassed by him a number of times when we were young.
My friend unfortunately was diagnosed with crohn's disease just before she started with Ice Capades and at that time there were few effective medications.  She had a very difficult time while away with the show and attempted to take her own life.  I was away at college at the time and was told she was also diagnosed as bipolar. 
Fast forward a few years and she had met a young man who she would go on to marry.  Her husband's family was Italian and my friend converted to Catholicism and learned to speak Italian.   His parents never accepted her and despite 2 wonderful kids their marriage was not a happy one.
She wanted to leave and take the kids but after trying her husband threatened to take her to court, expose her mental illness, and ruin her.
She reached out to her parents for help, yet they wanted her to stay married and refused.  Because she had been a stay at home mom she had no real money of her own and did not qualify for legal assistance.
She ended up taking her own life at about age 35 and left behind two small kids and a husband.
I was pregnant with my second child at the time and was devastated when she died.
We went to the funeral and a few years later her mother started to contact me and want to spend time with me.  I did so, we went to dinners and I spent time with her kids (who were at that time young teenagers).  
It never sat well with me that she had been abused by her parents and I felt horrible spending time with her mother.  I had this strange near guilt feeling that I should do it, but finally decided that I couldn't any longer.
Because I didn't feel it was my business to go into the abuse she had endured at the hands of her parents, I just let the relationship go with her mother.  I didn't explain,  I just stopped calling.
I suspect her mother wanted to spend time with someone who had been close to her daughter, but I just couldn't bring myself to continue.  It felt fake and wrong. 
I think of my friend every day and hope that she could understand why I did what I did."	Not the A-hole	0	0	959.0	48.0	0.0	0.0
bynopg	2019-06-09 18:59:09	StillStuckInBed	AITA for deciding not to tell my family that the surgery I'm getting will probably kill me?	"I'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It's 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and I'm following all the rules. So let's say my chances of dying are 60%. That's not great but not too horrible.

The thing is that I've had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.

My family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F) who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like I'm her little boy. The only reasons I could think of to tell them would be:

1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don't think this is something they can prepare for. I'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. I don't want that.
2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because I might die soon. It would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and I'd be unhappy because I would know they're miserable.

I'm leaning towards ""ignorance is bliss"" for everyone involved. If I survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. And with My Medical Condition (TM) it's unlikely I'd make it to retirement age anyway.

But is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? What are your thoughts?

EDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.

Edit2: I've already gone over how I'd want my body dealt with the last time I had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). I have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.

Edit3: I will write letters to them.

Edit4: Maybe I wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. I'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. They're going to come see me off and we'll say our I love yous and good lucks at the hospital.

Edit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this surgery.

And YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You're all very sweet for wishing me well. It turns out Reddit isn't as scary as I feared (I just joined and this is my first post).

Edit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don't know what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. I'm going to take a break and recharge.

EDIT7: Okay I'm feeling very overwhelmed here. I was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. Now there's nearly 400 comments. I wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but I wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that I hadn't considered. After reading over 100 of these comments I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm feeling guilty for hiding this but I can't see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn't* a right thing to do.

So many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. I'm truly sorry you had to go through that and I appreciate your perspectives. I'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.

PS: To all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but I understand) you should make it for four weeks. If I survive, I'll need time to recover and get out of the ICU before I come back to Reddit."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So me and a few of my friends had a friend group and we would always hang out and do shit and one day I found out they ditched me and went to hang out without me. Now I didn't care because I thought they just forgot about inviting me. A few weeks later they ditched me again and went to hang out without people they knew I didn't like.

Now after they ditched me twice I was really angry at them and I messaged one of my friends and she admitted they had a group chat without me and that they really disliked me. I also found out one of them didn't like me because I'm gay and that he was planning to out me.

Now after all that I was really angry so I decided to go to make a group chat and I sent screenshots of a few of them talking shit about others and a lot of messed up stuff and I basically ruined their whole friend group.

"I'm 23 and recently bought my first home, choosing it specifically because it was close to my aunt. The area had a focus on being family friendly, which I was aware but thought no biggie it just means don't do anything obnoxious or dangerous and I got on fine with everyone for the first 6 months.

&#x200B;

Anyway I call prostitutes over quite a lot. At the start I requested they dressed in casual clothes and acted as if they were my friends, but honestly it's fairly obvious what they are. After doing this for a month the neighbours stopped talking to me or have short rude replies, which confused me for a while but assumed it was just cause of my age. A few months pass and I decide to have 5 round for my 23rd, unfortunately the area got very congested with cars. Next morning see them all off and taking the wheelie bin out, when someone 2 houses down  is shouting that it's disgusting and he's calling the police about it. I said he can, it's not illegal which just made him even more mad and he started going on about how I'm bringing the quality of the neighbourhood down. In the end I said it's not affecting anyone and went to my aunts house, she said it's really starting to piss everyone off and wants me to stop.

&#x200B;

AITA for having prostitutes round in a family neighbourhood?

&#x200B;

A things to mention:

They are ""high end"", all from the same agency, extremely professional and work white collar jobs. e.g. They in no way could lead crime to the neighbourhood.

They've only blocked the street up once on my 23rd, every other time they've parked on my drive.

There are lots of young children/families, but nothing inappropriate happens outside.

There was nothing I had to sign restricting this sort of thing, and prostitution is 100% legal in my country."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I don’t enjoy working there.

Currently I live with my parents. They seem to think that because I don’t want to work as much as possible it makes me a lazy asshole.

Here’s the thing though: I don’t need to work that much. I get paid well, and even working 20 hours (instead of full-time like they want) I’m able to save, have some spending money, put gas in the car, *and* help pay a few of the house bills.

This applies not only when I suggested that I wanted to work fewer hours but also when I’m sick. I woke up with a terrible headache, feeling feverish, runny nose - and they said I should “suck it up” because I “would lose too much money by calling in”

"My husband and I both have great careers and are thinking of buying a house. However, I don’t trust him fiscally, especially when it comes to making such a big purchase, and here’s why:

A few years ago we were unemployed and struggling. His parents made some poor financial decisions and were going to lose their house. They wanted to “borrow” $20k from my husband. My husband asked me if he should and I told him only if he does it the proper way, by having them sign an official IOU (or whatever it’s called) and having it notarized. The reason being that it’s a very large amount of money and we were both struggling already. Well, he handed over the money without any legal documents and they told him they were going to sell their house and pay him back with what they get from it. 

Well, my husband’s father decided to give the house to his sister when they pay it off. I was beyond livid because they lied to us. Whenever I bring this up, he says his sister needs the house more because she’s here illegally and limited as far as work and has 3 kids. I should also had that my husband had a friend who was a known drug addict ask to borrow $100 and my husband gave him the money and of course, druggy never paid us back. 

We have a joint account that we put money in to pay bills and we have our own separate accounts and savings. This was a decision I made before we got married, and it’s the best decision I ever made. As long as the bills are paid, neither of us can tell the other what to do with our money. 

Since my husband has demonstrated that he is unable to think rationally when it comes to lending people money, I decided I want to leave him out of large financial decisions.

byngyb	2019-06-09 18:40:19	Veredyn	AITA for commenting on a Facebook post	"Ok,

So I was heading to bed, went on Facebook for a few minutes before going to sleep. As one does.

I saw a post from a friend I respect, it reads ""Every time I see a guy go all ""not all men"" when talking about violence against women, I immediately assume that guy is violent towards women.""

Now, I don't know the current debate around this. My assumption was that it is said in response to someone saying ""all men are violent against women."", because that would make sense as something to say in response.

Before you keep reading, please note this has been explained to me.

Now, I responded to my  friends post with the following simple comment:

""  I mean, I understand, but me personally, I would not want to lumped into that group of men. I’m not sure I would say “not all men”, but I think I would say “not me”. I would only say that tho when someone makes a broad ass statement.""

Now, this is the AITA part I need to know about.

I told my wife about this, and she was mostly livid.

She said me posting this ""offended her"". She then explained to me in a very aggressive manner what this is in context to, something I was clearly missing.

&#x200B;

For people who don't know, this is targeted towards guys who hear ""men are the main perpetrators of violence against women"", then say ""not all men"". I don't know the statistics but I think we can all assume that men are in fact the main perpetrators of violence. And saying ""not all men"" is a stupid response and adds nothing.

&#x200B;

So, I tell my wife, ""ahh that makes sense, thank you for telling me this."" I thought that was the end of it. I was sorely mistaken.

She kept on in the same tone, telling me how offended she is, and how I shouldn't of commented... ect ect.

I just rolled over in the bed and moved a bit away from and told her I am done with this, and that its too much. I am just trying to go to bed now. I got to wake up early for work.

&#x200B;

So, AITA? I somewhat agree, I probably should not have commented without know the full context (altho people should post more full context on that shit). But I don't think it makes me the asshole here.

I am glad I learned something new though, did not know this was going on.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am seeing a lot of the same thing in the comments. One person clearly did not read my full post.

So for clarification. I listened and fully understand the context, and how saying ""not all men"" is ridiculous. My wife did a fantastic job of explaining that. I think its a bit much afterwords, when I try to disengage because I need to go to bed, to keep berating me about it. Lesson learned, keep it at that."	No A-holes here	0	0	24.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

So this happend a month ago. Me (m26) and my ex gf (f23) broke up. We were still in good terms but the relationship wasnt making any of us happy at that time and we said we still want to be friends.

4 day after the break up i wrote her how shes doing and so on and she said she hopped to see me one day so i said we could met us at my place to give each other their stuff and hang out. Just to try if we could be friends. Just like normal singles and what normal single friends would do. 


Soo she came to me and it was a bit awkward but we managed to act normal and have normal conversations. We cooked and talked and it felt like we didnt break up.


After eating we went to my room to hang out a bit and i had her suff there. We sat on my bed and i laid down and said she could do the same. We watched something on netflix and after a bit of cuddleing i kissed her neck and she kissed me back. Yeah lets skip this part you all know what happened... we had sex. 


It didnt feel like the same way it did befor and i said to her we shouldnt have sex anymore if we want to be friends. She was confused and said she thought we get back together and why i havent said it befor we had sex. Tbh i wasnt sure what i wanted and i told her i dont know if we can get back together but atm i dont know what i want and as long im not sure i dont want to be in a relationship again that just ended 4 days ago because we werent happy. She left and we havent spoken for a month. 


Sooo yesterday we met and talked about the last meeting and she told me she felt used by me and was disgusted not only by me but by herself for letting herself get used and that she could never be with me again. 


I saw that this was hard for her and i was very sorry but i dont think its all my fault. Idk it makes me said to think that i used her for my advantage and made her feel like dirt or worse. So please reddit tell me if IATA or not.

byngjp	2019-06-09 18:39:19	nicostardust	AITA for blowing up at my sister for leaving in the middle of my graduation?	"So I recently graduated from university— it took me six years to get through due to mental health and chronic illness issues so I was really proud that I finally made it and I wanted to share that with my family. In order to have them there I had to buy tickets which over all cost me 100 (included cap and gown) to have both my parents and twin sister. My sister knew since early March when my graduation was in May. It took her until April 30th to tell me if she could make it or not. So first straw was she strung me along.  I really wanted to plan to go out to dinner with my family after the ceremony, but my sister told me she couldn’t make it because she ‘had too much to do’ but couldn’t tell me hat it was. Second straw. Third straw: Then on the day of my graduation I get a text from her in the middle of the ceremony; she had to leave and couldn’t see me walk. She had “a mandatory work meeting.” I was absolutely crushed. I had to hold in my tears for another hour and 45 minutes because I didn’t want to look like an idiot in front of 2,000 plus people. I automatically sent her a string of angry texts asking her if she even loved me and that she knew for two months that when I was graduating and she could’ve absolutely taken off work. I then said that she constantly disappoints me (she’s let me down several other times within the last year, but I kept my disappointment to myself.) She didn’t respond for several days... she often leaves me on read and doesn’t reply. I began to wonder why she didn’t just lie and say she stayed— I knew she was gonna leave right after the ceremony anyway. I was so hurt. Then my sister texts me back almost a week later and tells me that I’m a shitty twin and that I hurt her feelings and I don’t take how she feels into consideration. She never apologized to me, but I did to her. Last straw: I find out from my mom that the week of my graduation had been my sister’s last week at her job... she just “had to go to a mandatory meeting” of a job she wasn’t even returning to?!? I don’t understand. In my mind she absolutely could’ve skipped that meeting. So I’ve been passive aggressive toward her for a few weeks because she refuses to talk about it with me and tells me I’m over reacting. She doesn’t know that I know about work. Am I the asshole?

*edit: By passive aggressive I meant that I’ve been responding the same way she answers my texts— taking a long time or giving minimal answers. I haven’t been mean to her or anything. I haven’t called her names or actively gone out of my way to make her feel bad. 
And some background info: my sister had been acting very strange for the past 2 years and lying to me and my family about her life and what goes on. She has this boyfriend and only ever spends time with him and his family and has lied to my family before about not being able to make it to family events because she had ‘stuff to do’ but that stuff was watching anime with her bf. I also struggle really badly with a my mental health and have a hard time articulating my feelings in a healthy way all the time and this happened to be one of those times"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	36.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

My niece just finished her school year And is staying with my husband and I for much of the summer. It’s nice because own daughter is 13 and they’re very close. More importantly it gives my niece the chance to spend time with my parents (her grandparents) who are elderly. 

I don’t have a pool so when the girls want to swim, we go to my parents’. They live in a condo complex with a communal pool. I would say that the majority of the people in this complex are older/retired. And we live in a fairly reserved community overall. 

I have noticed that my niece has been getting a lot of..looks..from people when she wears her swim suits. It’s hard to describe the bottoms but most of her butt shows in them (I’m not sure if quite counts as a thong, but it sort of looks like that to me). And the bikini tops don’t leave much to the imagination. I don’t think people are looking at her in a pervy way. More like they’re a bit shocked. My mom hasn’t said much but every time my niece would get out of the pool, she’d practically tackle her with towels and this mesh cover up thing, which was almost comical. 

Anyway, I pulled my niece aside the other day and asked if she had any suits that showed a little...less. She said the suits she packed were all the same style, so I offered to go shopping and buy her something. I tried to explain my reasoning and approach the issue gently. But I think I offended her nonetheless. 

I was feeling a bit bad so I asked my husband if I went about this the wrong way.  The whole topic seemed to make him uncomfortable though so I just dropped it. Anyway, it would be nice to get some neutral perspectives over whether I was wrong here."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He’s 14, and has decided that he no longer needs to follow the long-standing custody/visitation schedule. His mom lives near us, so making changes to the schedule isn’t all that difficult, but his capriciousness about it has made things VERY challenging. He’ll say he wants to be at our house then change his mind last minute (and vice versa), so making any real plans is next to impossible. 

I do all the shopping (I buy all the groceries). I’ve always made sure to keep a variety of things that everyone likes on hand (favorite fruits, preferred type of peanut butter, snacks, etc), but lately food has been going to waste because he changes plans so often. For instance, he likes a specific type of milk.  The last two times I’ve bought it, in anticipation of him
being with us, it’s spoiled because he flip-flopped the schedule last minute.  I estimate I’ve thrown away about $100 worth of groceries in the past month due to this.  So I stopped buying those one-person groceries.  

He came over (last minute change) last night.  We had to order in dinner, because I wasn’t planning on cooking (since I didn’t know he was going to be here, I didn’t take anything out to thaw or prep). This morning there was a huge row because we didn’t have milk or his usual bagels (we had the type his dad and I eat, but he doesn’t like those).  I told him I didn’t buy any because I had no idea if he was going to be here or not.  He got angry at that and texted his mom who then called his dad (my husband) and told him that I was making Son unwelcome by not “refusing to have the food he likes” in the house. 

To my shock, my husband seems to agree with her.  He said I should just plan on him being here, since this is his house also (yes, of course it is), and if the food goes bad then so be it.  I said that I’d be perfectly okay keeping the food for him stocked if I knew he was going to stick with the schedule he had and not constantly make last-minute changes.  I’m not a housekeeper or paid cook!  I love having him here, but the complete inability to make any plans at all is just too much.

I background is that I'm sort of a screwup at life but I'm getting close to fixing myself at the ripe old age of 31. I'm in therapy, have been diagnosed and treated for disorders that I didn't know I had and am very close to finishing my bachelors degree in physics. My parents have been there for me but I've always preferred that I be left to sort these things out myself. 

This trip was planned without my consent. I was asked if I wanted to go on this trip several times and I kept my answer to a no. The problem was that my answer was ignored and eventually I just gave in and gave my passport so the trip could be booked. This is a pattern of theirs. From small to large things my answer is never respected. I usually have to start yelling no like a petulant teen for them to accept what I want but this is only effective when it's a small issue.

Over the past few days I've sort of lost it with them. I had a mini freak out that I lost because my mother started fake crying. She has always been dramatic and doesn't like attention to be taken away from her. No one can be more upset than her. 

I had another one today because I have repeatedly asked to be left alone but they both have been attempting to love/guilt bomb me to getting out of my mood. I'm just done with the relationship. I told them I won't be guilted into suppressing how I'm feeling anymore. I'm putting myself first because they won't let be an adult. I'm convinced they're trying to infantilize me to keep a kid around so they won't be alone together. Hell, my mother even asked me ""who's going took after me when I'm older?"" when I told her that I had a potentially disabling condition a few years ago. 

I just feel like I'm the asshole now because I didn't stick up for myself sooner. I'm ruining this trip for everyone. I've been trying to fly home but I can't change my flight without changing theirs online. I can't get in touch with the airline.

"My wife and “Mark” were friends in high school and had a brief romantic relationship before we started dating. He has a chronic disease that will cause him to die young, and he has trouble connecting with people. They reconnected after our wedding.

A year later, my wife described her relationship with Mark to a friend as an intense connection. She never suggested romance, but it was weird. She had begun to text Mark frequently, and on multiple occasions stayed up late to text him after I’d gone to bed. I voiced my hesitation but was met with reassurances that there was nothing to worry about. 

One night, she came back late after watching a movie with Mark. I didn’t think much of it. She’s had male friends with whom she’d watch movies. No problem. The next day, though, I found out that she and Mark had admitted to feelings for one another and kissed about it. 

I was calm and handled it well. She promised to go to therapy and insisted she wanted to be with me and would be willing to cut Mark out. She told him that only after she sought therapeutic help could they have a relationship. Life went on. There was pain, but there was a renewed interest in making our marriage work. She didn’t go to therapy, though. She insisted that she had figured out her problem. With reluctance, I accepted that.

Slowly, Mark came back into our life. They texted about a mutual friend’s health, but that stopped before it became late at night. It seemed appropriate. Once my wife was late coming home from work, and I found her in her car talking to Mark. That bothered me, but she promised she wasn’t doing anything wrong. They later met (my wife and I talked about it first) and redefined their friendship. Things were normal. 

That changed, though. A mutual friend had a stay at an area hospital. Mark and my wife both spent a lot of time with her. One night, my wife came home late from the hospital. She said she and Mark had had an emotional conversation in which they discussed continued feelings for one another. She told me she didn’t know if she wanted to be with me or Mark.

She again chose our marriage, though, and went to therapy for a handful of sessions. She said her therapist encouraged her to find the root of her issues and develop an appropriate relationship with Mark that didn’t threaten our marriage. She insists now that everything is ok, that she can be friends with Mark after finding that he actually had nothing to do with her misplaced emotions.

I’m still uncomfortable. It’s been less than six months since the first incident. When I see them texting, it makes me anxious. I don’t want to be jealous. I want to be kind and forgiving. When I oversee that they are making plans for a phone call, though, it upsets me.

Mark is a longtime family friend of hers. It’s inevitable that we will cross paths with him. We recently moved across the country, and she feels she only has a few friends here. I don’t want to be controlling.

Today, when we were driving back to my house after running errands, a few things happened. I was in the passenger seat. She needed to make a u-turn and got in a turn lane, and I pointed out that there was a no u-turn sign, so she couldn't make the turn there. She began to get frustrated at this point. Then, further on the way to drop my off at my house, I realized that she wasn't in the right lane to make the turn into my neighborhood. I assumed that she would realize and eventually change lanes, but after a while I realized that she wasn't going to and pointed out that she might want to get over. She wasn't able to get over due to a few cars that wouldn't let her in, so I told her she could take pretty much any exit up until the taco Bell ahead of us and it would still work. Since she was flustered from missing the initial turn, this caused her to miss the next ones and ended up taking the turn after the taco Bell, which is a dead end. Here is where she got really mad, saying that I was bossing her around and giving her wrong directions. After deciding to take a road further down to take a different entrance to my neighborhood, she took a right where she should have taken a left, which lead to another dead end (this time I decided not to tell her which way to go because I didn't want to make her any more mad, so I'd rather just let her make her own mistakes). She got even more angry after that for me not telling her which way to go. After we arrived at my house. She said she was very mad at me and that I was being bossy telling her where to go. I told her I didn't think I was being bossy. All I thought I had done was try to help. She said if I wanted to help I should have told her to get in the right lane earlier so she didn't miss it, and at this point I feel like I should apologize because I just don't want her to be mad at me but I know that's not the right thing to do so I held my ground while we kinda just sat in silence in my driveway. She told me if I didn't have anything to say I could leave the car, so reluctantly I did, and now I'm here and I'm not sure what to do. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

It was clear I was talking about a previous partner but obviously he kind of got upset at that

I never imagined him reading it. While I don't do anything like cheating or viewing nudes, messaging people etc I still kept my account private. He is super mad thinks it's weird how much time I spent on reddit commenting on people's personal lives and obviously the penis thing..

He mentioned (in high school) then he'd ""hurt"" me if I was gay, so I hid it. We visit once every two months for a drink.

Last week I come to town since we planned to hang out. He showing me his new apartment. He introduced me to his neighbors, an attractive guy and his gf. Both of whom he hangs out with. My friend and I hang out go. Next day friend goes to work and I'm on his couch. Usually I just head to a bookstore for a few hours until he gets off work. But I decide to go on Grindr and I find someone nearby. I send them a message asking if they're dtf. They respond, they're dl. I say, I'm okay with that. I send a pic; he sends one, and it's the neighbor. We agree to meet in my friend's apartment because his gf could walk in. We hook up. I feel guilty about that since it feels my life is lie upon lie. I decide to come out to him.

When my friend gets off work, we go to a roadhouse 45 minutes out of town. We grab a booth and since he's the driver, I get a beer and we talk. I decide to tell him I had sex in his apartment. He is surprised, but said ""there you go!"" and smiles and asked if it was in his bed. I said no. He said, ""Good, otherwise I'd punch you,"" laughed. He asked who it was with. I tell him I'm bisexual.

""Okay... so it's a guy."" I tell him yeah. He looks at me weird and asked why I didn't tell him earlier. You just got off work, I told him. ""No I mean like back then."" I told him I was just confused and that I did tell him I did stuff with guys. ""I guess so.""

We changed subjects; we get our food. And I feel a lot happier. I decide to be more frank with my sexual encounter and tell him it's his neighbor. He doesn't believe me, so I tell him that I found him on Grindr and his neighbor is dl. My friend said that the neighbor has a gf. ""That's why it's dl"" I tell him. I tell him that guys like his neighbor have gfs but fool around. That's why we hooked up in your apartment, because his gf might've caught us. My friend said okay, then asked how long I knew I was bi. I told him since high school, but didn't feel safe telling him since he mentioned he'd ""hurt"" me that one time I made a joke about being gay. He looked at me and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. I was a dick. That was messed up."" Then changed the subject. We finished our food and left.

We're on the road for ten minutes when we pull off to the side of the road. He tells me he feels uncomfortable and he could drive me the rest of the way to the apartment, or I can walk, but he doesn't, or wouldn't want to hang out with me in the future. When I asked him why, he wouldn't give me a straight answer and eventually said that I'm a liar and a bad friend.

I haven't talked to him since. On average we text once a week, so the silence isn't too deafening, but just this recurring feeling that I used my friend and betrayed him somehow. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She has this cart thing that she can move around the house with but thats about it. I wash the dishes, make the food, help her with HER work, do the laundry.

But my dad just came into my room screaming because my mom is crying in the kitchen saying that her daughters never come and ask her what she needs. But i thought  her telling us what to do was what she needed. I drop everything i have to do just to help her when she asks for it, why would I ask her what else she needed?

I work at a playground at a mall and a white woman and daughter show up and I'm watching them along with the other children. Around a hour later a black man shows up and i seem him approach the girl and he walks away with her. It was a bit far away and i yell for him to come back and he ignores me. I am terrified thinking this man abducted her as i have not seen the mother so i call mall security and they approach the man and point tasers at him and he freaks out. They tell him to get on the ground and threaten to call the police and then the little girl asks ""why are you doing this to daddy? what did daddy do?"" and from this point we found out that the kid is biracial, her father is black and that man is her father she just happened to look really white. I profusely apologize and the man is very patient and understanding saying that many people doubt he is the father as he looks nothing alike. As for the mother, apparently she left while the man was there and i somehow didn't see her leave and the man came to pick up the daughter to take her home.

I feel really guilty about the situation and my friends and coworkers have given me a lot of shit about it. They've told me that i should feel ashamed for doing that and making such bold assumptions and a couple people have even gone so far as to call me racist for belting that the man is kidnapping her because he's black or that he can't be affiliated with her because he's black. Look if the same situation happened but it was a white man taking a black girl i would've had the same reaction, the man didn't check in with us he just took her and left. I honestly feel like this was a honest mistake but please let me know if i was an asshole in my actions

My parents divorced when I was 11, before that the relationship with my father was good. After he got a new family, soon after the divorce, our relationship started to decline. After he got his new family, he doesn't seem to be interested in my life no longer. We talk, maybe 2-3 times a year, I visit him once a year for a day, partially due to my anxiety flaring up at his house. It is cause by events that are not really relevant with the issue. I recently had my birthday and all I got from my dad was a text message, tho it's the same I sent to him each year on his. For the past few years, I've gotten no present and last year he remembered my bday a week late. He has a farm and usually at that time of the year there is a lot to do, so he said he forgot it because of that. For me, even getting a small present, would be more symbolic, it would show that he still cares about me and my life. Other than that, he doesn't show any genuine interest about me or my life. Am I an asshole for expecting a present even tho our relationship is nearly nonexistant?  


Edit: To answer a few questions people have put. I'm 24. He has no issue with money, but for me, everything that comes, goes, there's no extra as of now. I'd likely go visit him more, if I had the money, bus and train tickets are really expensive and whole travel would be 5-6 hours minimum, and I don't have a license.

Also to add, I wouldnt except much, like 10e would show he cares. During last visit, I spoke to him about my anxiety, even tho his attitude isnt exactly great when it comes to mental health. It was an attempt to better the relationship, as usually talking about difficuly things can fix things.

Edit2: After reading the replies I realised its not right of me to expect anything. I have made the assumption that other kids, adult or a child, gets one, tho I have no proof of that assumption. I have to try and work on our relationship first before expecting anything. Thanks for everyone who replied, it has given me a lot to think about."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I just feel awkward cooking full dishes for him because he owns his own restaurant and he’s a really, really good cook. I can’t even compare, and my attempts are embarrassing in comparison. Not that he says there embarrassing. When I cooked for his birthday, he acted really happy and said it was cute even though the food was blah. 

So anyway it makes sense that I would wash dishes since he cooks, but every time I try he tells me he finds it really relaxing and he doesn’t want me to do them. He’d rather do it himself. I say this like it’s something new, but he’s been like that since I met him. 

When he was younger, his family didn’t have much money, so when he did get to cook a dish (that wasn’t just rice and beans) it was always a big deal for him. His mom passed away young, so he’d cook for his younger sibling since his dad isn’t around a lot. 

Now that I’m thinking about it, it kinda makes me feel bad. I’m a med school student and I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’d been studying in my room for hours and lost track of time and my boyfriend will casually bring me food and do the dishes and not really say anything about it. I think I should do something nice for him because he really acts like him cooking/doing the dishes all the time is no big deal.

byn0mc	2019-06-09 17:59:57		AITA for leaving my friend in a foreign country when she disregarded our departure time?	"This happened today and I just want some outside opinion.

We are currently on vacation for a friends wedding in a foreign European country.  All my best friends & our partners have been together for the wedding and budgeted some time to head south afterwards to have a real vacation because some of us were in the wedding party and it was high stress. To get to our new location was about seven hours from the wedding, so we had to catch a taxi at 5:30am to a rental car company at the airport and then drive down.  We did not want to drive in the dark as this historic town is known for its small and narrow roads and it was already horrendous in the daytime navigating. 

Fast forward to last night and one of my best friends met a guy from the grooms party and decided to go home with him. It has been talked about for days that we are meeting at 5:30am and have to leave then because we arranged a taxi for the hour ride to the airport.  We constantly reminded her before she left with him that she needs to be home at a certain time or at-least be there before the taxi left. She agreed and said she won’t let us down.  Fast forward a few more hours and she still isn’t back to our Airbnb, we had to contact another friend to find her because she wasn’t checking her phone and when we finally got in touch she was very intoxicated and said “don’t give me a curfew”.   I could tell she was very drunk. We kind of gave up and hoped she would show up before we left. 5:00am rolled around, no sign of her and her clothes and luggage were still sprawled over the Airbnb. So we left at 5:30am like according to plan. 

She came back to the Airbnb 1 hour and 45 mins after we left. She made a huge fuss according to another friend and decided to stay with this man she just met but still seems very angered with us leaving her and doesn’t think she did anything wrong and that we didn’t have to leave as early as we did. There were five of us leaving and she was the only to say this. She is most likely going to ask me to give her the money back for the Airbnb, which I’ve already used to pay off the cost of it on my credit card. 

Lastly, not to mention I was worried about her and could hardly sleep because she wasn’t answering her phone and I had gotten a text at 10:30 from my friend asking if she made it home okay. This led me to believe she had attempted to leave and didn’t make it back safe. I didn’t get in contact with another friend to confirm her safety till 3:00am.  

AITA for leaving my friend in a foreign country even though she blatantly disregarded our time and itinerary? Do I refund her the money for the Airbnb? My one friend told me it was super dangerous we just left her with this guy she hardly knew but we gave her so many opportunities and she didn’t seem to care."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

To preface this:
We are in our mid 30’s, been dating for a year and a half, boyfriend does not drive, he lives with his elderly grandmother and has for the last 7 years and does nothing to help her around the house. He’s normally a nice guy, if a bit aloof sometimes. Never verbally abusive or otherwise abusive.

Last night we went to a very fancy event. BF wanted to network, I was supportive. 80% of the people he spoke with he didn’t even introduce me to. One man even asked “Does he make you stand behind him? Just push him out of the way!”. Boyfriend was totally uninterested in me the entire evening. At 11pm the event was winding down and I wasn’t ready to drive yet. I suggested we walk to a local brewery that was still open so I could get a water. We walked in and I got my water and he immediately said “I’m tired. This isn’t where I need to be. We need to go” I told him as soon as I was sober enough to drive we could go, but I really just needed to drink some water. He demanded we leave. I went into the bathroom and he started texting me really bizarre things. Random words “heartache”, “kill me”, “where are you?”, “you’re an asshole”, “fuck my life”, “fuck you”, “cunt”. Literally for NO reason. I came back out and he had gotten rid of my water so I got another one and calmly sat at a different table. He came over to the table and continued to say we needed to leave. I got up and walked outside and sat on a bench and he stormed off. He is then texting me asking where I’m at and if he should get a ride home from someone else. Still texting me that I’m an idiot, an asshole, etc. He comes back to the bench and is saying we need to leave. “What about Ireland?”. We went to Ireland together in April of 2018, it was amazing, he paid for most of it, I did not ask to go, and it was understood I couldn’t afford to go (I’m a single mom). I said “what about Ireland? It was over a year ago, what are you talking about?”. He walks off again, so I went back to my car (still shouldn’t have driven yet), got in and left. I went to his grandmother’s house to drop off the things he had in my car and her car was already gone to pick him up. I left his things inside the garage and left. His last text to me was that I’m an asshole, I need to “just dissolve”, and “fuck off”. Am I an asshole??"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My daughter (32/f)

My son (27/m)

I love my kids equally.  

My daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  We don’t charge her rent and so she’s built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

My son is a bit more aimless.  He has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  He supports them (gf doesn’t work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  They have lived in Airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

Last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  Apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  There’s no way he’ll be able to pay that off on his current job.  He has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it’s going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  Meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  The debt will inevitably grow with interest.  My wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

I don’t want my son to file for bankruptcy.  It would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  I believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  When I pass all my children will have is each other.  They should learn how to rely on each other more.

bymt1d	2019-06-09 17:41:32	roboterschinken	AITA because I said not to hook up with a guy?	"Ever since I know my friend shes been in an absolute toxic relationship. Both of them weren't good for each other but neither of them was willing to acknowledge it and break up. That was until it got really bad 2 weeks ago and after almost a decade of their relationship they broke up, mutually

She has been very physical with this other guy for the last year while still in her relationship, her ex-boyfriend was suspicious (rightfully) about the guy. She has just been so flustered by his attention and sweet nothings - I didn't say anything because I felt like it was none of my business to comment on and she tents to twist facts and what has been said to fit her narrative.
We all do this to some extent but she proudly boasts about her ability to manipulate others, find their weak spots and use it against them

Now she is about to hang out with this guy, for the first time as a single person. And I've been encouraging her, to go out, have fun and make out with some strangers and make getting feel good. 
Today we had brunch together with some friends and in a quiet minute I turned to her and said, ""Just do me a favour and dont hook up with friend X rn, I dont think it'd do you any good just now."" A minute goes by where she seems to mull over what just has been said and then she goes off at me ""This is no place for you to comment, it's none of your business with whom I do what and when and I can do whatever the f* I want""
At that point I just blank faced, it's the one thing I cannot stand is being angrily yelled at by people that mean a lot to me (which she knows, see above manipulating etc) so I just didn't say anything for the reminder of the brunch to her and just talked to our other friends that had joined us after that outburst. 

She tried to make funny remarks thorughout brunch but I was hurt and didn't want to gloss this over. She has done this in the past and I let her rug sweep me, I didn't wanna do it this time.
I wanted to wait for a moment alone with her as to talk in private as I didn't want this to escalate any further or be a spectacle. But after awkwardly cleaning up together, she packed her bags and left while I was in the bathroom, without saying goodbye or anything.

We were planning on her getting clothes and some other stuff from her ex's house and then she was returning to hang out with our group tonight. After 4h of us hanging around and waiting on her, she texted one friend ""Sorry but I'm not coming back, it's not YOUR fault tho"".
I texted her and let her know how hurt I was by her reaction, which ended in a tirade of what an awful human being and friend I am, how I tried to control her and ""I knew her ex always manipulate her"".

I said that I am sorry if I offended her and at no point was I trying to manipulate her but apparently I am a major asshole now and can just basically go f* myself.

Things were getting better but they exploded yesterday. The short of it is that my wife was spending time with our kids when I got home, and I said something along the lines of “do you want me to take the kids out and give you a break?” To my wife. She said yes but later that night she got upset with me for saying I was giving her a break. She feels that my language implies that taking care of the kids is her primary responsibility and I’m doing a favor by taking them. I think she’s reading too far into it.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for a couple of years, and he is the cleaner one in the relationship. My car may have trash scattered around but it is not out of control by any means. Controlled chaos if you will. Recently my boyfriend and I took a trip for my birthday (8 hour road trip), and he said we would take his car. A few days before the trip he started to complain that it would get messy and if the people we were meeting up with needed a ride he didn’t want them to ruin his car. 

Now I’m not friends with insanely messy people, but sometimes they may track some dirt in the car or sunscreen and it can leave a mark. Keep in mind this can totally be cleaned. 

So it ended up me taking my car and driving for my birthday to avoid hearing him complain all weekend about it. 

Fast forward to today. We are in the process of dog sitting and we are returning the dog today. I said I didn’t mind taking the dog back in my car because animals in his car is a BIG NO. Well on my way to work my transmission blew. Long story short, called out of work and got a rental car. They said no smoking and no pets. Obviously they will charge if the notice any. 

I am very strained for cash and am afraid that if I take the dog in my car, and they notice, I will be charged even more and I don’t want to risk it. I asked my boyfriend if he wouldn’t mind taking the dog and right off the bat he got upset. Started asking why I can’t just take the rental and clean it and that he would help me clean it. 

I got upset and told him that this whole situation with his car is driving me insane and I really don’t ask for much and he should just get over it and use his car today. He thinks I’m trying to find a reason to start and argument and fight with him but I think I’m justified to feel the way I do. Am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I’m so sorry about format I’m on mobile. Okay so a little backstory: we’ve been together since 2015 and have been engaged for a year. I’m so incredibly in love with him and he makes me the happiest person alive. But sometimes I feel like I’m taking care of a child. 

For example, he has Sunday’s off so he can play games online with his friends. I don’t care about that because that gives me time to do my own thing. But when his friends don’t answer him for awhile, he’ll go into our bedroom and lay in bed. So I go in and see what I can do to help. Sometimes he’s just in there to cool off (our apartment doesn’t have AC) or times he isn’t. When he isn’t cooling off, I offer to play games with him, watch a movie or anything. But he declines and sighs. And he’ll lay in bed for awhile. Sometimes he falls asleep and then he gets annoyed with me that I let him fall asleep when I continually try to keep him up. 

I know I should discuss this with him, but whenever I try to talk about things like this he always turns it around on me and suddenly I’m left feeling like the bad guy.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 6 months and she has a (self admitted) irrational fear of hair. It’s to the point that she visibly and audibly gags when loose hair is brought up or when she sees it lying around. Just today at breakfast she saw some hair on the table touching her napkin and ran into the bathroom and vomited and then threw away the rest of her plate of food. I suggested to her that she should set up an appointment with a therapist or a mental health professional just to discuss this fear and maybe tease out why it exists and ways to address it/ make it so it’s not impacting her life so much. It’s to the point that when she sees hair on her clothes or the floor she will freeze up and exclaim “help me help me help me”.  When I suggested seeing someone she got very defensive and combative towards me. Saying that she’s fine and that I’ve only known her for 8 months and it’s not my place and that she’s gotten better about it on her own.

He cheated on me with this ""friend"" about one year before our marriage and I forgave him, of course, but they work in the same place so he *has* to talk to her at some point. All good there I'm not crazy.

The problem comes when she calls him in non working hours **and** the child of that woman wants to say hi to my husband, or she's asking to ""borrow"" money because she can't provide for her child. This makes me feel awful, because the cheating didn't envolve sex, just some kisses and messages (that's how I know they didn't have sex) of him telling her that he *wanted* to be with her and help her raise her child. Of course the parents of my husband said he was crazy and they gave him the house (we live in) for me and him, not some random woman with a kid.

I have asked him several times to cut his friendships with her, but he only says I am crazy, and jealous that I have everything I want and such,and he only talks with her for work, but I know its not true.

Myself and AC are close in age, but not the same. When we were younger. He would misbehave at family events, just because he knew my aunt, uncle, and family wouldn’t raise a finger. If they did, he’d claim that it was because of how severe his autism was (even though it was diagnosed as mild).

This always ground my gears, but nothing I could do about it. It was never *that* terrible.

Then my older brother let all of us play on his Xbox. We were all having a good time until he decided he was done. Ok, that’s fine. But AC starts acting without paying attention, and trips on a wired controller cord. And the Xbox falls off of the shelf. It hits the floor.

Edit: The town I grew up in was a small conservative town, that ostracized me when they found out I was atheist

Final Edit: Thank you all for your honest opinions.  I should have handled this situation differently, and used it to remind my family on my feelings on prayer inside my home.

"If we're going into specifics, that hometown in Brazil is Sao Paulo, and my new hometown in the U.S is Orlando. I was born in Sao Paulo, but my parents and I moved here when I was 5 and a half, and we've been here since. I'm 17 today. 

&#x200B;

About this ""childhood friend"" in specific...I wouldn't necessarily say we were ever close friends, but my aunt and her grandmother are pretty good friends, and my parents would often leave me where my aunt worked, and that grandmother would come over and chat with my aunt...and any two small children you put together will interact with each other. 

&#x200B;

Really, my aunt made a bigger deal of it than me. She thought it'd be cute to see two ""childhood friends"" reunite. 

&#x200B;

Recently, a few months back, after not going back to Sao Paulo since I was 5, I went there...and I met up with that friend four times. In real life, I though we interacted quite well. Nothing mind blowing, but I guess she was a cool casual friend. 

&#x200B;

However, through Facebook, after I came back, she revealed she was very upset about things that I said. 

&#x200B;

Though I never meant to be offensive, I guess I could kind of see it. 

&#x200B;

When she asked me what I liked about Brazil, I just said the food, some of the places, and the people. And she was upset that I only said three things. 

&#x200B;

She also didn't like how I made occasional comments comparing Brazil to the U.S...such as ""the U.S roads are much easier to drive on""...or ""everything in the U.S is much cleaner""...or ""the U.S schools are a lot bigger."" 

&#x200B;

But also seemed upset that I went back to Brazil only to stay there for a few months, and then go back to the U.S. ""But this is your home, where you were born!"" But it wasn't up to me anyways. 

&#x200B;

And through Facebook, ever since, she's just been avoiding all of my messages altogether.

bymekw	2019-06-09 17:05:38	BarneyBodie	AITA for asking an artist to increase the quality of his work back to its original levels?	"I’m making a comic book in my free time, and have a cover designer, an illustrator, and a colorist. I’ve picked some great artists, and the pages are just gorgeous. The colorist is an amazing artist, and painted the first two pages of his assignment very nicely. I asked people at the comic store I go to, they said it was a 10/10 in just aesthetic quality, like pretty unreal. However, the colorist doesn’t look at the reference material for the coloring I gave him, seems to not really like heeding instructions, but the end product is so nice that I ignore those difficulties. I’m big on lore and realism, so to say that I’m ignoring the out-of-lore color changes means a lot.

Anyhow, his last two pages were awful and he wanted to color and be paid for the rest of the pages, immediately. Like, the quality was such that I could’ve done it and I’m by no means a great artist. I offered to increase his pay by 40% if he got back up to his original levels, and that’s when it began. He started ranting about how he was getting paid incredibly little (he was the one that offered up that price), so it wasn’t worth his time to put much effort into it. I also mentioned that I wanted to keep an eye on his work, a few pages at a time, so he wouldn’t compound any big mistakes he’s made. Now he wants me to get the illustrator to do part of his work, and the illustrator is a family man who’s kids are out for the summer, so that isn’t gonna work. 

In addition, he also wants me to point out all the flaws in his latest pages, pretty combatively. Like, it’s very obvious that there’s a difference in quality, with character items missing, the shading being almost absent. I’m not asking for a Mona Lisa, but I want this to be a good piece of art and I’m paying him for that. I’ve never made comics before, and maybe I’m out of my league here, but I am trying to do right by everyone. I pay people upfront, they get the wages they ask for, and I give everyone outlines, and reference materials to go through. I also don’t have deadlines either, since it’s a recreational thing for me. I’d say they have it pretty good but I’m beginning to think maybe it’s secretly offensive to them that I’m not a fellow artist. This is a fun thing for me, and this is a job for them.

I work about 80-90 hrs a week, at a job where I get screamed at for a living. It’s really nice to come home to a bunch of emails showcasing the latest pages and panels of the comic.

As I am a Canadian, I felt really pissed at that and decided to make a counter argument (which was later removed by somebody else): since the message was long and didnt fit 2000 char limit I drafted them in Docs and still saved them [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GH8PH8pgYQOZ30w5AfJetmWZV4toZPMQYYShq7v-EgM/edit?usp=drivesdk)

Which the result become them hating on me, and causes a backlash. The remaining staff team still supports me and the most logical thing to do is to mesaage them an apology. But I chickened out and temporarily left the server. So there it goes..."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1469.0	311.0	0.0	0.0

bymc36	2019-06-09 16:59:44	kofriedchicken	AITA from getting in a fight with my best friend and leaving?	"I am from the midwest, and growing up, my family was the only Asian family in a a predominantly white community. There was one other Asian girl in my class, but her parents are Caucasian. Because her parents wanted her to experience her culture (we're both Korean), she hung out with my family often and we became good friends.

We would do regular high school things. We'd do makeovers but she would look in the mirror and say things like, ""I'm so ugly. My eyes are so small. That's why I have to wear so much eyeliner. I wish I were white."" And she would compare herself to her parents and older sister who are biologically related and tall and attractive. To be honest, I also have rather small eyes, and whenever she said something about that, I would feel kind of sad. I would tell her that no, she's beautiful, and I would show her Kpop idols who looked similar and we'd try to emulate their makeup.

We're now in different colleges - she goes to a school in California - and I flew out to visit. Last night, I went with her to church where I met this international student from Korea who is interested in her and he asked her out on a date. Her response was, ""No way that's gross."" He seemed pretty hurt by it.

I talked to her about it later, because her response seemed really harsh. She told me a few things:

1. He is too Korean and all his friends are from Korea so they speak like ""ANNEONGHASEYOO"" but when saying the word, she used a very stereotypical Asian accent.
2. She only wants to date good Christian White Boys
3. Asian men are ugly and look feminine.
4. Asian men reminds her of MY BROTHERS who are like brothers to her, so she can never find them attractive.

My family talks in Konglish a lot and she knows some Korean. The fact that she made that stereotypical accent made me sad. I felt kind of attacked by it, and I told her that it really wasn't okay to make fun of people, and it sounded like it came from ""hate"" rather than a joke. She said she couldn't be racist because she's Asian too, and that it's not her fault that Asians aren't attractive... I am Asian. My family is Asian. My mom says we're all pretty nice looking.

I kind of got upset at that point and raised my voice at her and told her that until she ends with the self-hatred, it's too hard for me to hang out with her. I understand where she's coming from - she's always been self-conscious for looking different from her family, and I've tried to be supportive in the past, but it hurts me as well too.

She said that it was ""Whatever"" and that the only good thing about going to my house was eating bulgogi and it always smelled like bad kimchi anyway. At that point I was really upset so I got up and called a Lyft and showed up at my uncle's house an hour away.

I still have four days left in my trip, and I feel kind of bad for leaving. We were supposed to go to the beach today."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

She came to me at the beginning of May telling me that she was going to go back to school and retake a program she had previously taken but unfortunately didn't pass before we moved in together. I was very supportive of her decision and honestly proud of her for it. However, her going back into this program means she has to drop to part time at her current job and we would need a 3rd roommate. This was perfectly fine because at the time, one of our close friends had already discussed moving in with us once their lease expired in June. Well, that friend backed out at the end of May and we had 1 other person she knew who wanted to move in, so everything was still fine. Until, that person decided to also go back to school and move back in with their parents. Now, she's fully enrolled for the fall semester and we have no 3rd roommate. She wants to find someone online, a stranger, to move in with us and I'm so unbelievably uncomfortable about this idea. I'm having such bad anxiety over all the what-ifs; What if the person sucks, what if they harm our animals, what if they steal our stuff, what if they don't pay rent or bills on time...etc. I really dont even know how to bring this up to her without me basically having to tell her that she can't go back to school right now.

First time doing it, luckily there was a feature to ""try"" the glasses on. We all tried the glasses, verified the sizes with our current glasses, and ordered.

I should tell you that the glasses don't ship to the country I live in, so we had had them shipped to a friend's house, and then when he came to visit, we got them (he came about a week after they got delivered to him). We all tried on our glasses today and said everyone looks good. Except my sister's. Hers look like the massive coloured glasses you see the artists on kid's shows wearing. They don't look horrible, they just don't look nice, at least to me. 

Now the problem. If it was my other sister, I wouldn't have minded saying that these glasses don't suit her, because she could take the criticism. But my younger sister lacks self confidence and is always doubting herself. This is the first time she's chosen glasses for herself by herself. It's usually me or my other sister who choose for her. Now I know she won't get mad or anything, but I don't want her to feel like she can't make any life decisions. They're only glasses. But they're the first pair she's chosen for herself, and I want her to feel like she's gotten the right one. Her friends most likely won't make fun of her, and neither will most of her classmates. But I'm worried about the kids around the neighborhood. Those guys are insensitive, and would probably go all out. At that moment I don't want her to feel decieved either. 

TD;LR: my sister bought glasses, they don't suit her. I don't tell her so can gain confidence, but I'm worried about someone telling her they look bad, making her lose both confidence and trust in us."	Not the A-hole	0	0	450.0	45.0	0.0	0.0

We were all friends on Facebook and would chat one in a while. A month ago I got and sent the following messages on face book. I'm just copying and pasting them. Names have been changed.

&#x200B;

Roommate: Andrew

Guy I had a relationship with: Mark

Me: Well me

&#x200B;

**Andrew**: Hey were you ever pregnant by our old roommate Mark?

&#x200B;

**Me**:  wtf kind of question is that.

&#x200B;

**Andrew**:  Well is straight to the point !

Why sour coat you were military and some ex of his told me you were

I didn’t believe her

&#x200B;

**Me**:  I wasn't. Even if I ever was it would really be none of your business.

**Andrew**:  You sound so defensive

&#x200B;

**Me:**  I'm actually really offended.

&#x200B;

**Andrew**:  That’s not my intention s

&#x200B;

**Me**:  Its kind of a really sexist and disgusting to even ask that out of the blue.

Its also pretty rude. Have a nice day though.

&#x200B;

After that I unfriended him and he sent me

&#x200B;

**Andrew:**  I didn’t realize you were so sensitive

So asking I was under the impression people were sopuse to be truthful

And straight honest

No one was trying to hurt your feelings Megan

It was a question aren’t friends taught to ask some one something if they heard something about them ?

That’s why I asked you instead of assuming it was true

&#x200B;

This is when I blocked him. Now the other people that I lived with that I was a bit closer to have all told me I was being a dick and that he only asked a question. Considering I don't have any kids and he is super conservative I know what he was trying to imply and get out of me. No people are telling me I should unblock him and re-friend him. Did I over react am I being an asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I think people are missing the last part of the post here. I reacted the way I did because he is ULTRA conservative and posting about how abortions are murder all the time. I have no kids. I think he was trying to get me to admit to an abortion.

All of my roommates are super chill and are comprehensive that I'm the new guy and don't know much of the city, they are also really well organized. But here is the problem, one of the guys is very abusive towards my stuff, he leaves his shit (feces) in the bathroom whenever I'm the only one there. 

I don't know if he is using my dishes or my bathroom stuff but I'm starting to suspect the he is because my stuff is moved around all the time. He also is a chain smoker and the administrator told me that smoking is allowed but only in the living room which is super far away from my room, but he is located right next to my room and is allowed to smoke inside his room. 

My room fucking reeks of tobacco and im also allergic to it (rhinitis) my throat gets soar and I get migraines. He leaves his stuff all over the place. Also apparently the guy that got kicked from the place was like his bf or something, and also studies at the college where I am. I feel like he is holding a pretty big grudge on me and is trying to make me upset and leave so his friend comes back . He got kicked for bringing too many people to the place.

I want the fucker out even though I just got here a few weeks ago, I'm complaining a lot to the administrator so that he gets in line.

"Almost all of my fights with my sister are about her being super critical of some pretty insignificant situation and me telling her to just let it go. Some examples are her going on and on about someone next to her in a yoga class moaning/groaning when they were doing some stretches (she talked about it the whole car ride home saying if it's hurting you that much, then you probably shouldn't be going to a yoga class) and someone at Walmart who almost ran their cart into her cart (she kept bringing it up after the conversation changed saying she can't believe that lady would do that and seemingly not care). I get that these things are inconvenient/annoying but in the grand scheme of things, it's really not a big deal to be harking on it so much. It's such a drag to hear her constantly complaining.

&#x200B;

The fight we had today was because my mom called my sister to ask her about a recipe. She wanted to know what kind of tomatoes she needed - diced, paste, etc. I guess my mom asked a couple of times to clarify and when she got off the phone, my sister was making comments about it like ""I said diced and she kept asking what kind! And she was like anything else?"" I told her to stop being so critical over something that took no time or effort out of her day. I get especially defensive when it comes to my mom because people have been shitty to her all her life, and she *truly* doesn't deserve any of it. 

&#x200B;

I yelled at her that it was really petty of her to point out that conversation for being annoying, and reminded her that she's always talking about being less negative and letting things go more. She retorted by saying that I can be judgmental too. I said I never said I wasn't judgmental, and called her a hypocrite and stormed out.

B is old and I have had them since I was a child and B was a kitten almost 13 years now. My roommate's cat doesn't get along with mine, mine was neutral towards hers until A started attacking B. Now B is afraid of her. We tried keeping them separate, but A clawed the carpet under the door and completely destroyed it in spots. B is declawed and a really calm temperament, but has anxiety with being locked up because of past experiences. I am upset because A steals B's food and attacks B but if we lock A up then A destroys the carpet (we are in an apartment, so our deposit is already gone from this fucking cat). My roommate doesn't really know what to do, but won't try some things, but we have tried associating the cats and we have sprayed cat off on the area, trimming A's claws, blocking the area with towels, and letting her walk free around the house with B. None of these are working and I am getting annoyed where I have suggested soft paws and my roommate won't. I am getting to the point of telling my roommate that A needs to go, because moving B wouldn't fix the destructive problems as much as B is blamed for A's behavior and I am not budging on getting rid of my childhood friend anyway. WIBTA for that? Also any suggestions for fixing the problem or how to go about this delicately?
Edit: A problem many of you are missing is I could be financially responsible for her cat's damages. If it goes much further they will probably charge on top of the deposit and if she decides not to pay I am responsible and it is bad on me trying to rent somewhere else."

bym0iu	2019-06-09 16:30:05		AITA for getting annoyed when my wife says she “paid for” something but means she put it on my credit card?	"My wife and I have been together for a long time. When we got together, we were making about the same (small) amount of money but I was broke due to student debt, and she helped me out a lot. We decided back then that we wouldn’t combine our money until I got out of debt, because I didn’t want her to be on the hook for my student loans.

Fast forward to now, we both have successful careers but I make a lot (~8x) more than her. My job takes a lot more time than hers, and has me traveling unpredictably, so she does most of the household management work. We still keep our money separate and my income pays ~95% of the household bills. We are both generally fine with this arrangement — I recognize that taking care of the house is a ton of work, and without her support I couldn’t work the schedule I do. Also without her support earlier in our marriage I would never have had this level of career success. (I give all this context to make the point that my question below is not at all about the actual source of the funds involved.)

My wife is an authorized user on one of my credit cards, and she uses it to pay for household stuff. She has gotten into the habit of saying “I paid for X” when she means “I put X on your credit card”. I find this fairly annoying. She makes the point that researching the purchase and getting registered and figuring out logistics and actually going to sign up and swipe the card is a lot of work — and she is absolutely right. But then she says “I literally paid” when she means she literally swiped the card and signed the receipt. I feel like I’m the one who literally paid — I pay the bill on that credit card.

Again, I’m fine with where the money comes from. I’m just annoyed at how she talks about it, and how she gets upset when I ask her to use different language. I’d be fine with “we paid” since it is 100% true that she did a lot of the work involved, but I don’t think she can say she “literally” paid unless she is providing the funds.

So this time she came up for my graduation, and it was her last day here. So she had to make a move. My younger brother was in a bad mood about having to eat something, and was telling everyone to shut up and being rude to my parents, until my father grabbed him and told him to go upstairs. 

Of course my grandmother hops up and confronts my dad. Granted, she is around 5 ft tall, and my dad is around 5'10''. She calls my father an abuser, makes up a bunch of stuff about him being verbally abusive, etc... Threatens to call child protection services. Remember, this is my graduation day. Eventually I go to my room, extremely upset by her actions. I hear her in the kitchen accusing my dad of more stuff, calling him a cheater because he went on a trip without my mom. No proof what so ever. 

It seemed evident to me that she was preparing this. It was instantaneously, and she brought a lot of stuff completely unrelated to the original ""problem."" She actually told my mom to divorce my dad. Of course my dad and my grandmother never got along, so whatever. But she made the claim that we were all afraid of my dad, and that's why we wouldn't stand up to him. It was bullshit. She pretends to know how we're treated all the time, and that she knows everything about our lives, but she lives ~2000 miles away. 

So I finally got up, and told her that she was full of shit. I told her she doesn't know Jack shit about what's going on here. That she moved away, and was thus not a part of my life, and no matter what my father was or did, at least he was always there. More than I can say for her. In the end she had my great grandma, her mom, join in, and when she disagreed with my grandmother, said ""fuck you"" to her. I told her promptly to fuck back off to her home, and to stop tearing apart mine. 

She went on this speel about how we always disrespect her, so I pointed out how she just told her own mom to fuck off. After that I told her I didn't care if I never saw her again, and left. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	348.0	132.0	0.0	0.0

bylyhq	2019-06-09 16:24:33	jukeboxf	WIBTA if I told my best friend that his musical sucked?	"Sorry about the mistakes, I'm writing this on my phone.

So the story is that : My best friend joined some choir and a year ago they decided to create a musical of the corpse bride. On paper it seemed great, however they chose a director that is not a part of the choir and my best friend, ever since rehearsals started, kept complaining about him being cheap (like he didn't want to spend any money on costumes, wanted to rely on donations or what ever the singers had on their closet). Also his directions for the musical were apparently very unclear. 

And so yesterday they performed, and everyone seemed to have enjoyed the performance but as someone who is familiar to the musical world, well I kinda thougt it sucked. Not musically speaking : The singers were great and it was really enjoyable to listen. But for example, there were long moments where no-one moved, they were just singing and not moving or dancing along. There were simply standing there singing, not interacting with one another. I understand that sometimes it's the right way to go, but in the scenes where that happened it just felt weird. 

What I'm trying to say is that the direction sucked, in my opinion because it didn't look lively. Would I be an asshole to say what I think to my friend? He really enjoyed this project, except for the director and doesn't seem to realize how bland the musical looked like (except, again, the singing that was great)."	Asshole	0	0	39.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

I can honestly say that for as much as I payed for that class, I'd say 70% of it I had to teach myself from the textbook. Not that the teacher wasn't amazing - he absolutely was. I have so many great things to say about that instructor.   


The problem was that this one guy. For every one sentence *anyone* in the room spoke, he had a story to share or some kind of opinion. He would just *not* shut up. The guy was in love with the sound of his own voice. And because I've worked in the same company he was presently working for, I knew that most of what he was saying was wildly embellished lies.   


On the second-to-last day of the class, I was just in the crankiest mood. I opened my notebook and started taking notes. But on the side of my notes, I started keeping a tally. Sure enough, after every single person spoke - even just asking to run to the rest room - he had a remark to make.   


We got excused for a break. I asked if I could address the class. I stood up and held up my notebook. I said ""do you know that guy has had a comment on *every single thing anyone has said?* "" He started to interrupt me, and I rounded on him to add ""tell me, do you *ever* shut up?""   


After break, he came back. He started doing it again, I started marking my tally again. He saw me do it and closed his mouth. Didn't talk the rest of that day, nor on our last day. Kinda wish I'd spoken up sooner."	Asshole	0	0	334.0	33.0	0.0	0.0

bylupy	2019-06-09 16:14:47	stardragonfruit_0813	WIBTA for telling my roommate that his girlfriend can’t come in and out as she pleases?	"So I (18F) am moving into an apartment with 4 people in the fall. We are all 2nd year college students. One of my roommates has a girlfriend that 4/5 of us have an issue with. 

In the entirety of our first year, she manipulated, lied, gaslit, and tore all of us apart. She would intentionally ruin relationships and when she was finally confronted, cried and claimed we were bullying her and she didn’t do anything wrong. She went to my roommate about it, as they were together. He believed her over us, but eventually realized she was not being truthful - but stayed with her because he “didn’t want to be alone”. fine, his choice. 

Fast forward to now, she is living in an apartment about 10 minutes walk away, or a 5 minute drive. She has it in her head that she can just come stay in OUR apartment instead of her own whenever she wants, to cook and clean for him and etc. She has one roommate, a larger space, and a better kitchen - which is great! But i don’t understand why she needs to come stay with us. We have more people and less space, meaning we don’t exactly have room for her to come and add her belongings to the mix. it would make more sense for him to be seeing her in her space.

I want to tell my roommate that she needs to not be here constantly, but don’t want to start problems before we even move in. I have spoken to the other roommates, all who are uncomfortable with the fact that she thinks we have an open door policy with her, when she has never asked if WE are okay with it. 

WIBTA for telling my roommate that she can’t come in and out as she pleases, without asking us how we feel??

EDIT: just so there isn’t confusion, all of the other roommates were involved in the problems with the girlfriend. they are not random outside parties, we all know each other and are close."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I just started driving and am beginning to start driving on the highway. It’s scary for me and while driving my dad told me to turn to the next stop. Not knowing he meant the highway instead of any regular turn. So I passed it and man did he get angry saying something along the line of how could you be so dumb and generally not talking to me for 5 min straight until getting on the highway attempt 2. I’m new to this all and very afraid because he makes the choose of where to go not me. While attempt number two was going on my other problem areas as a driver came up on a turn. He got angry again and again about lane changes I had to make. I felt dumb because he’d never said something like that to me before in such a tone. I felt like crying but went on with it. I did good on my turn onto the highway and so forth. But I just wanted to go home after it all and he expressed disappointment in me. After which later he was going to pick up mom from work. I felt horribly but he said I should in a mocking voice of me saying no. Later on mom sided with him saying I shouldn’t get angry with him over this. But I felt that it was right."

byltpf	2019-06-09 16:12:09		AITA for asking my girlfriend if she’s secretly trying to get pregnant?	"Alright, so I have a bit of a dilemma here. A little backstory. My girlfriend and I have been together for about five months now. She says she’s on the shot and we have sex pretty frequently. Anyway, she tells me often that she’s terrified that I’ll leave her. I tell her that I never will, but it never quite sinks in with her. She also tells me that she really wants to have a baby with me. She says that when her shot is up in a month or two, she wants to use no birth control when we have sex. I told her that I would rather wait a little while longer, but this response put her into a little bit of a bad, unresponsive mood. She got over it and said she would go to another form of birth control.

She has one kid right now, and recently told me that about a year ago, she BRIEFLY considered having sex with her ex-husband for the sole purpose of having a child, because she was worried about it getting to be too late to give her son a sibling.

She noticed a little bit of bleeding, which is unusual for her while on this shot. She was feeling sick and all this other stuff. She had a doctor-administered pregnancy test. It came back negative. This was about a month ago. 

So some time goes by, and we’re here today. She’s at work, and I look around in the bathroom for something, and notice three opened packages of pregnancy tests. Five of the six are used and all read negative. Thinking about all the stuff I said above, I started questioning whether or not she could be trying to get pregnant without me knowing. After having a negative result from a doctor, isn’t it unusual to take that many pregnancy tests unless you’re actively trying?

I confronted her and asked her straight up if that’s what she was trying to do and she is really distraught that I would even ask her that, and asked if I really think that little of her. I felt a bit like an asshole, but I was still wondering why she didn’t tell me she was taking the tests. She said that she was worried that I would think she was weird for testing, so she didn’t tell me. I don’t understand this because I was the one that brought up buying a pregnancy test in the first place, so why would I think she’s weird?

byltjo	2019-06-09 16:11:47		WIBTA if I confronted my mom about her spending habits?	"Let me preface this by saying my mom isn't rich. My father passed a little over 4 years ago, and we live off his social security. However, she acts like she has a full time, well-paid job on top of this or something. She doesn't; she mystery shops (which makes almost no money) and works in real estate but has only sold 2 small things over the span of 3 years. I make more than her working part time at a Subway.

I just graduated high school and my mom wanted to take me on a grad trip. Ok, I've been talking about wanting to go to Japan or Europe for years, I'd love to! I can budget something (I'm really, really good with stretching money) and we can go for a week or two. But no, she wants to go on a cruise to somewhere tropical. I hate the tropics. I'm allergic to heat (I get rashes and get very very dizzy), and have no desire to be on the beach. Whatever, I want her to have fun so I'll budget it. No, she wants to go all out  It's exceedingly expensive, and she wants one of the most expensive rooms, shore excursions, upgrades, to bring a friend...

And it extends to home life. She bought us a hot tub. Expensive clothes. Useless or frivolous things we can't afford, but then she talks about not having money to eat at a fast food restaurant or let me go to the movies when my paycheck has been stretched thin. She complains about losing my social when I turn 18 and how she doesn't know what she'll do, but she keeps living this lifestyle.

It's too much. We're about to go on the trip, and she's been on me about me being irresponsible with my money for saving for 3 YEARS for a trip I'll be going on in a few months. I try to see where she's coming from with her spending, but I feel like she needs a wake up call. WIBTA, would that be out of line?

tl;dr: I want to confront my mom about her hypocritical and frivolous spending when she will soon be living on no income, but I don't know if that will be out of line as I am only 17."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"So I'll give you a bit of context we have been together for 3 months now and everything has been going really well or atleast I thought. Let's call her Jo, Jo is 19 and I'm 22. We were on a night out together and with a couple of her friends which I get along with very well. We were all dancing on the dance floor together and then I went off to get a drink at the bar and Jo just asked me to hold onto her bag for her which I did.  


I got my drink and came back to see they were still dancing so I decided to stand on the edge and drink my drink for a bit. She was dancing with this girl that none of us knew I don't have a problem with that at all in the slightest. Then she looked over to me and smiled and then proceeded to kiss this girl. I just stood there in disbelief.  


To go back to the day previous as well  I opened up to her and told her about my past traumas of people cheating on me before and how it really hurt and other things as well.   


Back to the club, once she'd finished she then looked at me again and smiled and I felt like I'd just been stabbed in the gut. So I just walked away and she followed and was apologising profusely and then started crying I comforted her but I was and still am so upset and I don't really know what to do so she goes back to join her friends and I go and stand in smokers and just contemplate everything that just happened.  


At the end of the night I meet her outside and we start talking about what happened and how I felt about it and she almost laid the blame on me saying I thought our relationship was stronger than that when I hadn't even mentioned anything about breaking up or anything. I'm normally very rational and don't make any quick decisions I may regret.  


Low and behold this girl she kissed walks behind her and goes to give her a hug and then a peck on the lips goodbye and I just stand there again in disbelief as to what has happened again. I know Jo was drunk but we were literally just speaking and trying to sort this out.

  
What the fuck do I do this just brings back awful memories of previous times where I have been cheated on and I don't really care if it's a man or a woman it happens with?  


I just hurts and I'm really upset about this and now today she's gone on as if like nothing has happened and is annoyed at me that I'm being a little blunt."	Not the A-hole	0	0	441.0	58.0	0.0	0.0

But recently, he’s been involving himself in the marriage between my wife and I. I wasn’t too fond of that and asked him to politely back off, because he hasn’t known my wife nor I for that long.

This morning after I got off work my wife called and said that my mother-in-law was being rushed to the ER. She had chest pains and her blood pressure was really high. 

It’s about an hour drive from work to home, so I said I’d meet them at the ER. Halfway home I got a call saying that my wife would meet me at home, ok, no biggie. I could use a shower to clean up and stuff. 

Get home to find my wife in tears and come to find out that my father in law (who has only been in the family about 6 months) said that it was best that my wife leave because he felt my wife was adding stress and she wasn’t welcome there. And my mother in law didn’t say anything, just kinda sat there. 

Now my wife and my mother in law have a very strong bond, they’ve been through hell together. I told my wife that my father in law had no right to say any of that. That he’s just mad because we told him to take a step back. I told her that I was gonna say something to get him to understand that while he may have married into the family, doesn’t mean he gets to say stuff like that. My wife is against me addressing him, saying it’ll only cause more problems. Am I the asshole for wanting to stand up for my wife?

bylq64	2019-06-09 16:03:15		AITA to Report A Probable Hoarder	"On my drive into work there is a property outside of city limits, surrounded by trees, that is chock full of old cars. I mean jammed. Way more than could possibly live there. And none of the cars are antique or special. There is no sign he’s doing repair work, either. I checked google maps and the imagery shows his property extends back quite a ways and is all chock full of cars and a few ramshackle sheds. My mom is a hoarder. I know the look. This is it.
Now, as I noted the property is surrounded by woods. He’s not hurting anyone else by doing what he’s doing. It’s a bit of an eyesore from the road and the vehicles might leak fluids into the ground, but that is it. But there is no property values to be reduced, neighborhood to blight, etc. If you’re going to hoard cars, this is kind of an ideal place to do it.

My concern would be this is probably an older adult who might be vulnerable and living in unacceptable conditions inside their home. Do they have water, heat, etc? Is the place sound? Given the conditions I can see from driving by and the google maps image, and it’s not just the cars, this is not an unvalid concern. There are broken windows, trash, etc.  But I am more worried about their safety inside than anything outside.

There are several big on the not reporting to adult protective services side issues. Only hurting themselves, I don’t know of the county will help with treatment or just make things worse by a forced cleanup.  And the response by officials can be even more harmful than letting them be.  

On the reporting side, if this person passes or is hurt due to conditions I can see and immediately recognize as hoarding behavior, I am morally responsible for not taking action. No one else would know, but I would. And the conditions insofar as I can see are legitimately worrisome to that end. I know he’d be furious to be interfered with, but he’s mentally ill and I’m not. I owe him a duty of care in that regard, morally if not legally.  

Ultimately I don’t know nor do I see a way I can verify how bad the conditions are inside the home, but the outside is enough to give me reasonable suspicion the inside is bad.  I could be wrong.

My GF and I are traveling around SE Asia for two months and we invited my friend and his GF to join us for the last week of it. I rented a really nice 3 bedroom Airbnb in Thailand with a pool and close to the beach, where they are planning to meet us and stay with us. We agreed to split costs for the Airbnb down the middle. 

Today, about 3 weeks before they arrive his GF informs me via group chat that her friend will be joining us for 2 night and 3 days in the 3rd bedroom. I blew up at him on a private thread as to not start a dramatic group chat and the conversation went like this: 

Me: wtf that's a really dick move 

Him: I don't know what your talking about OP and stop overreacting 

Me: If you dont know what I'm talking about you have no idea if I'm overreacting, first of all. And secondly, it's all in the group chat. 

Him:  [His GF's Friend] is a friend from college who is in Thailand. She hasn't seen her in like a million years and [His GF]  just graduated med school. It's a very special time for her and her friend wants to see her

Me: Uh huh, that's fine... but again: you invited someone to stay with us for 2 nights without running it by the two people that invited you and got the house? 

Him: Calling me whatever this is a ""dick move"" is way way way way out of bounds

Me: It's a huge dick move, it's deeply inconsiderate and you should know that. I'm glad this is a special time for her but you had no right to do this without at least checking with us  

Him: Would you like us to tell her to get a hotel? Is that the endgame here? 



At that point I stopped responding because I figured I was going to say something unkind. But I want to say yes, she should get a hotel.

Lately it's been great, we've actually been working on our actual relationship instead of being drunk assholes to each other. However...

I have a pretty fucked tooth that's been giving me problems for a few weeks. Yesterday morning I went to urgent care for antibiotics (no pain meds) to help until I get into the dentist. I was in pain (even after a shitload of ibuprofen) and grumpy all day and still am this morning. He was highly caffeinated yesterday and in a super good mood and was nothing but accommodating...and extremely ""playful."" Talking my ear off, trying to get the usual banter out of me, and so on.

He kept on being extra perky/in my face. I've even tried talking to him about this before.. ""I try to tell you how I feel multiple times, get ignored, and you don't listen until I go super bitch.""

And now he's grumpy as well and said I don't have to be a stick in the mud, I responded with ""I asked you multiple times to stay calm. You don't listen until I go super bitch, then you get mad and don't talk to me -- and when you don't talk to me you finally knock off whatever I've asked you not to do off"" (which I admit was a bitchy thing to say). He's currently sulking in the bedroom.

bylk95	2019-06-09 15:48:30	HousewifeInDistress	AITA for not wanting to go to my MIL’s birthday tomorrow?	"I feel forced by my husband. I don’t want to go because of all the crappy things she’s done to me over the past two years and how she has conducted herself. 
It upsets me that I feel like I’m being forced when my husband doesn’t respect my not wanting to go and it makes me feel uncomfortable and I know I won’t be pleasant or very nice. I have not spoken to her since the wedding in February. 

———————

History of the dynamic between my MIL and my husband (sorry for the issues, I’m not too sure what happened to my reddit) 

Part 1;

I had my bridal shower this weekend on Saturday 9th of June; I didn't get told by anyone that it was my FMIL's birthday on the Sunday 10th of June until last week. Mind you, the bridal shower had been planned for a month and a half.  
I live in Location 1 and my family lives in Location 2.   
So I had naturally planned to spend the entire weekend with my family with my FH in Location 2.   
She came up to us to plan something for her birthday on Thursday 7th of June; her birthday was on Sunday 10th June.  
FMIL lives in Location 1, the same state as us and we see her most Tuesdays.  
We said that we couldn't as it's my dad's birthday next weekend and we have not seen my father in 6 months because my family lives in Location 2 and I work a lot trying to set up my life in Location 1.  
   
She came to Location 2 in the car with my FH and I, we paid for the petrol. We didn't do that with any other bridal shower guests. Only because my FH knew she'd complain about the cost and the price. Even though she wants to be included in EVERYTHING!  
She'll complain that she's not included, but then complains about the price and cost of actually attending.   
   
We had her gift, we asked if we could drop it off on the Sunday for a quick coffee for the birthday, before we headed out to the function with my family and she rejected the offer.

I didn't decide the day, my sister (my MoH) did. I had no control over the date or the day for that matter. The whole weekend was planned a month and half in advance.   
She was invited in that month and a half time frame. She could have said something. But she didn't. Only a day before we left she said something.   
   
I've also not seen my family for 6 months either. My father’s birthday is next weekend and I wont see my family until Christmas. My FH has only met them twice before.   
I see her every other Tuesday and she's planned a birthday party this Wednesday, something my FH and I have committed to going to.   
She could have caught a plane back home on Sunday, she is an adult, I don't control what she does for that weekend. She can make plans of her own. We aren't stopping her.

So then, my FMIL had the audacity to announce that it was her birthday on the Sunday 10th June (The day after the bridal shower).  
My mother was so livid as my FMIL basically threw a toddler tantrum at my bridal shower.

This is not the first time she's acted in such a way. I had an engagement drinks with my friends and FH's friends, it was friends only; she tried her hardest to self\-invite herself. We didn't invite FH's father or my parents, or family on both sides.

She's told us to our faces that she's not supportive of the wedding and would've liked us to get married in 2021.   
I have already sent our invites, paid deposits and such already. We get married in February 2019.  
She seems to be under the giant impression that you need to have graduated, got a full time career for a few years and have bought a house before you even think about getting married.   
People lose their jobs all the time when they're married, it's not ideal, but do these people divorce because they've not got a job for the moment? No? People re\-skill themselves all the time, does that mean they have to divorce while they go back to school? No. It's stupid.

She's fat shamed me with my wedding dress and she's said that my FH wont like me when I'm fat at the wedding.  I'm a size US10.  
   
She's been so against me since I came on the scene, she uses every situation to make digs at me and hasn't been at all supportive of the wedding or anything. I've tried to include her in almost everything, but she just hates everything and has been so negative.  
   
I honestly have no clue why since December I've been public enemy #1. I honestly don't know what to do. I try my hardest to get along with her, include her in everything and do my best to go over to her house every Tuesday so FH can have some connection to her, even when he doesn't even want to go.   
But for some reason, I'm just the evil bitch in this whole thing and that everything that goes wrong in her life is my fault.

She's just been plain nasty. I cannot stand her and I don't want her involved in anything anymore. She's so controlling and manipulative.   
I just don't know how to say to her that I don't want to include her in anything anymore.  
 

Part 2:

My FMIL tried to organise a second bridal shower after I just had one, with people neither my FH or I know and aren’t invited to the wedding.

She doesn’t understand my need for a traditional wedding and I’m trying to keep it close to tradition as possible.

I don’t want a second bridal shower as I was very happy with my first one that my MoH (my sister) hosted for me.

I need ideas on how to tell her to stop trying to organise wedding things without consulting me first or even with people neither FH and I don’t know. This woman severely lacks boundaries.

&#x200B;

Part 3:

I was at FH’s mothers house right now and I was complimenting how nice it was, I actually loved it and all she kept on saying is how “small” it was.

It was almost as big as my parents house and I actually felt really offended by it. She is so bloody snobby. I also commented how close she is to the shops and the the local town centre and under her breath she said “I don’t give a shit”. Like she was completely disinterested in what I had to say. Her demeanour towards me has been bitchy and outright obtuse.

Like why would she say that?

She’s been nothing but unwelcoming to her home, I even brought some sweets too.

&#x200B;

Part 4:

I went to FH’s mothers today after the birthday thing last week, I thought she got better after FH spoke to her about her previous actions with me. She had bought me a birthday cake and it was during one of the “Wednesday night dinners” at her house (his parents are divorced) last week. So I though this might be a olive branch of sorts. Turns out, plot twist, I was wrong.

So I got to talking about the fact that I went to a public school - then she said “oh, that explains a lot” like she was looking down on me for going to a public school. Like I was not good enough for her son because he went to private school.

FH won’t do any drastic and I just don’t feel like it’s my place to say anything in her own home. I don’t know if I should.

Part 5:My FH and I have recently moved out on our own into our own home. My safespace.

My FMIL (Snobby Snu) bought my FH a Google Mini, something I hate - I’m very concerned about my security both with my network and my other technology that runs on the same wifi network that this obtrusive technology is on. She knows this. But she went ahead and bought the stupid thing for a Christmas gift for FH.

I hate it and she knows it. She’s stomping on my boundaries again. I refuse to have something like that in MY home.

&#x200B;

Part 5:

Found out just after the wedding from my FIL that my MIL was trying to email him and get him to go meet up with her (they’re divorced). She wanted to drive a wedge between my husband and I before the wedding, said to him about me to “buy her a ticket to hometown”. She admitted to FIL that she was creating situations to get in between my husband and I, to cause us to fight. His father refused to go to these meetings. She knows how to press FIL’s triggers, she gaslights him - keeps making remarks. It builds up and when he drinks he explodes via emails etc. However, after the wedding she served him a cease and desist notice, he’s not to go within 500m’s from her. This makes me angry because my husband and I are planning on having children, how is that going to effect the future of our children? Birthday parties.

MIL if you read the other posts I made about her is a Narc, stage five clinger to her son and I’m not entirely sure if it’s a Jocasta complex situation. It’s really creepy, in every family wedding photo she was in, she was clinging onto husbands hand. So creepy. Then 12 days after the wedding, she wished him a happy Valentine’s Day to him, to her “baby boy”.

When I posted the professional images on the facenovel, she only liked pictures that she was in and just my husband. Didn’t like a picture that I was in.

&#x200B;

Part 6:

I’m praying to the good Lord above that this will be the last post I make about my MIL. Also, on phone - crappy formatting. Sorry.

Anyway, I found out today my DH basically lied to both myself and my MIL telling both of us that everything was fine with the other and rug-sweeping many issues I thought had been dealt with, he said that he’d spoken to his mother about the issues and he didn’t. So yes JUSTNOSO.

HOWEVER, all is not well since my MIL accused me of isolating her son from the family etc and I’m using him. To the contrary, if it were up to my DH he’d be at home playing video games, drinking beer and working, not talking to anyone. I forced him to tell his mother that he, myself and her would sit down at a cafe and go over the 11 dot points I’ve just written out to stay on point and not deviate from any emotional manipulation she tries on me or my DH.

In the phone call DH made to MIL tonight she acted as she normally does, accuses me of everything and accuses me of causing the drama. (It’s funny how the one who wants to draw boundaries and call people out for their bad behaviour is the one causing the drama).

So let’s see how this meeting goes.

&#x200B;

Part 7:

Anyways, if you read my previous posts about Snobby Snu you will find she is frustrating, Jocasta and to be honest out right a bitch. I feel sorry that my husband came from her hole, to put it nicely. I’m really trying to rationalise with my Christian bones in my body to be patient and also to allow my husband to continue to “honour thy mother” and to be very respectful in this whole process of trying to set respectful boundaries, but damn it to hell she makes it so hard.

After waiting two weeks and then springing on us that she had an Easter lunch at her house before she left to go overseas, she then refused to meet with us alone on that day. She then started talking about her new boyfriend etc. Major DARVO.

Anywho, my husband then said (paraphrasing) “we need to fix this and set up a time to meet up with us just alone , because HID is apart of the family now” (us being DH, her and myself). She didn’t respond at all and I am friends with her on the F social network commenting etc, she didn’t even wish DH a Happy Easter which she always does on these types of holidays. She even sent him a creepy “happy Valentine’s Day to my eldest boy” on Valentine’s Day.

So she’s overseas and hasn’t even spoken to him or even bothered to set up another date. I don’t even know if I want to try to fix things if she’s going to continue to act like a spoilt child and not even fix things and punishing my husband for setting boundaries and wanting to protect his wife. By the way, so proud that he finally told me the truth about his half truths and his supposed talks with her that never happened. But is now trying to fix things and is actively trying to right his wrongs, not rugsweep and finally standing up for our little family. I’m so proud of him.

But it has really rustle my brolly on how she’s acting and treating my husband and in extension trying to further not fix things with me.

I just don’t get her game or what she might be planning next. When she comes back from overseas does DH reach out to her again? Does she? Should I go? Should he go? If we do, what should I/DH do/say?

I had such a game plan for the last meeting, but now I don’t know what to do.

\------------------

This brings me to the current day:

She STILL has not organised a meeting, I bought her a Mothers Day gift on behalf of my husband. Apparently she liked it.  Not that I even got a thanks. We left it at her house and we have not seen her.

Anyways, a few things happened. We moved out of our apartment because we lost our jobs at the same time and are moving states. Well my husband thought it would be a good idea to store all of our stuff at her house until we get a house in the next state.So because her birthday is this weekend she invited us to her home for her birthday, she still has not even tried to fix things with us with all the transgressions she's done.Now that our stuff and furniture is at her house, I now feel like my things are held hostage and that I'd have to go because I'm worried for my furniture and my belongings. We are currently staying with his father at the moment and I leave next weekend to go to the other state to go for a few job interviews.Apparently this was all planned by my husband with BOTH his parents in his ears about plans. 

They didn't even want him to go to said other state and now I have to go down there by myself and sleep on HIS best mans couch because I'm not welcome at my parents home in said state (my homecity). So it's really awkward and he refuses to tell his parents that I'm not staying with my parents, but on his best mans couch for a whole month.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm in such a difficult position and I don't feel like my husband understands how awkward and upset I am about his mother and also the fact that I am going to be staying on his best mans couch for an entire month with another guy in the apartment as well (his best mans room mate who I have never met).

Not only that, he expects me to get a job and find a place for us to live all by myself without help from him. He apparently got a casual job here that doesn't start until next month. So he will be here in this state for an entire month and a bit living with an actual bed, in a safe environment, while I have to live couch surfing style in an unfamiliar place without him. We only are a newly married couple too. I just feel like I'm getting the shit end of the stick here.

I just need help... I don't know what to do and he wont even try to fix anything with his mother. He jokes that when I leave for a month, he's going to get his mother to do his laundry and get her to cook for him etc. He doesn't understand how much that hurts me and I've asked him to stop, but he keeps going on about it. He wont even try to encourage a meeting to fix this stuff with his mother. He also willingly just carts me off without a thought and gets me to do all the heavy lifting (did I also mention that I packed all of our stuff into boxes, organised the cleaners and the removalist to move our things?) He just doesn't seem to be doing much and I'm doing all the work. I just feel like this whole thing is vastly unfair."	Not the A-hole	0	0	102.0	18.0	0.0	0.0
bylk7c	2019-06-09 15:48:21		AITA for taking a screenshot of my friends art?	"Throwaway because he knows my main account.
Pretty much one of my friends draws artwork and sends it to other people. The drawing he was working on he decided to consult me on a minor detail about the art and I have him my opinion. When he finished the art he sent it to the other person in our discord call and not me. I asked him why he wouldn’t send it to me and the answer is because it’s just a funny joke to keep it from me since he knows I want to see it. He took this joke a step farther when he would send the image while I wasn’t looking at discord and then would delete two seconds later so I couldn’t see it. This lead to the situation. What I did is that I turned my discord icon to say I wasn’t  online when I was. Then he took the bait and ended up sending the artwork. This time I was able to screenshot it. He got PISSED that I took a screenshot of the artwork and claimed I was stealing. I assured him that I wasn’t going to send it to anyone and that I just wanted to get a good look at it then I’ll delete it. He still wasn’t happy and is now saying about how I’ve stolen his art. I don’t know what to think. Ok one hand I think I’m in the right because he did send me the artwork and I’m not going to share it. But he thinks he’s right because he is saying it’s theft.

When we split, we agreed to remain civil and work to ensure our son was happy and well adjusted. This has worked for the most part until recently. I currently pay my ex $900 a month in child support.  I also provide for my son's health insurance, dental, and pay all co-pays.  We both earn about $130K a year. I have my son every weekend Friday to Sunday. I recently received a promotion and will earn about $20K more per year. My ex believes I should increase my support payments since I now make more. My going in position was that she needed to demonstrate that my son's monthly expenses exceeded $1800 per month before I would entertain increasing my support payment. She was quite upset and claimed that since I am going to earn more money, the additional money shouldn't be a problem and that I'm being selfish.AITA for not wanting to pay my ex more money simply because I earn more money?

Edit #1

My ex checked out the thread and feels I am not proving all relevant information. She believes that the following are important factors:

1. My new wife has been unemployed for the last few years to work on her masters. She recently got a new job making $60K a year. I believe this is not relevant because it's my wife's money. My Ex points out that this is additional revenue in the household easing my burden and should be factored in the decision. 
2. I have 2 additional kids that have reached the age of majority in the last 4 years. My eldest graduated from college this year and my middle son turned 18. 5 years ago I was paying $2700 a month in child support for my kids. Now I only have my youngest."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"This actually happened several years ago and is honestly pretty dumb, but it's always bugged me and I was thinking about it the other day so I figured I'd post here and finally find out whether or not I was the asshole in this situation.

So at the end of my first year of high school, one of my best friends (let's call her Sarah) got me a new pencil case for Christmas which I thought was really sweet. I should probably point out that this pencil case was from a stationery brand that at the time was the *shit* with school kids so to eleven year old me it was a pretty big deal.

Anyway, fast forward to the night before the new school year starts and my younger sister's pencil case (also from this popular brand) breaks while she's packing her stuff. Since I now had a spare I was just going to give her my old one, but I realised it was looking pretty worn out so I ended up giving her my new one to use instead which she was really happy about.

So I show up to class the next day with my old pencil case which Sarah notices immediately. She questions me about it and I explained what happened thinking that she might be just a little upset if anything. Oh, if only I'd known the wrath I'd unleashed.

She absolutely lost it. At first it was petty kids shit, name calling and insults and that kind of rubbish. Only this quickly escalated to her hanging around with the 'mean girls' group of our year level who, for the next five years, went out of their way to make every day of high school literal hell for me. All over a pencil case. 

Anyway, the bullying aside, I still honestly don't know whether or not it was wrong of me to do what I did in the first place. So lay it on me, Reddit. Was I TA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	10.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

I was at lunch at my parents house and a few friends of theirs were there too. We ate , the friends left, everything is normal. My dad went to sleep and I lied down on the sofa to relax a little bit before leaving. At this point I was tired and mentally drained from only having slept 5 hours and it being 30 °C outside. 

Then my mom comes and starts asking random questions, whatever, I just respond half heartedly and try to not get mad at her since I feel a headache coming. 

After half an hour of this I just stand up and walk to the door and get ready to leave. My mom follows me and keeps asking questions, including ""what's wrong?"". At this point I'm just done and say ""I'm tired."" I get out and close the door behind me.

After that I recieved a message from my dad saying that she's crying.

bylhnx	2019-06-09 15:41:52	CharmingBoard	AITA for adopting and keeping a racist dog?	"This might seem unbelievable but be with me on this and do some research as this does happen. Dogs can be racist. 

I adopted a dog named dogmeat (we named him after the fallout 3 and fallout 4 dogs lol) from the pound a few weeks ago and he's the cutest dog i've ever seen. He's maybe a year or two old black lab and german shepherd mix and i love him so much. I live in Vermont which is like 95% white and my area is probably 97% white i very rarely see nonwhite people so it's likely my dog isn't used to nonwhite people either. He was abused growing up and the people who abused him were a black couple. This is where i think the racism came from being that the only black people he's ever seen happened to be abusive. Dogs can often be discriminatory towards people who have the same traits as those who abused them from hats, beards, certain clothing, skin color or gender. 

My neighborhood happens to have 3 different black families, one is next to me and the other is across the street. When we first got him home he barked at my neighbor Shamar and i thought maybe he just didn't like strangers or was still nervous, not unusual. He barked at his wife but i noticed he didn't seem to bark at my white neighbors so much from the window. My wife brought in her friend Dashawna and my dog barked at her nonstop i couldn't calm him. I had to drag him to my bedroom and lock the door. A few weeks later we had a BBQ and my dog got loose and went after Dashawna and her family. He didn't bite or even touch them but he just barked at them looking aggressive. Dashawna and her family were the only black people at the BBQ so at this point is almost entirely certain my dog has a prejudice against black people. 

 Dashawna has complained to the HOA about it.She claims my dog is making her feel unsafe and unwelcome in this neighborhood despite the fact that dogmeat has only ever barked at people and as far as i know has never bitten anyone. She won't even leave my house so unless Dashawna is on my property she's safe.  She's trying to get the HOA to force us to remove the dogmeat. My wife wants to take him back to the pound and replace him for another dog. I love him too much and he's already called this place and i can't stand the thought of sending him back. He'll be so devastated and i've built too much of a bond with him. The HOA is really pressing this shit against me and I'm trying to compromise with the HOA saying i'll get dogmeat behavior lessons and my black friend Dale has offered to help me remove his stigma around black people by being friends with him so he can realize not all black people are a threat. 

Dawshawna and the HOA are not onboard with my idea and say that he's still a threat to everyone and that i need to get rid of him. My wife wants to remove him because it's just easier to find another dog that doesn't bark at black people. It seems like nobody but me takes into consideration the dogs feelings and his experiences.

bylgo6	2019-06-09 15:39:06		AITA for leaving a group of friends after a fallout between us?	"I had this group of friends a few years ago back in 2016 who I trusted very much, and equally they trusted me. Three of the girls in that group (Who we will call C, B and S) had a thing for me. I knew B and C had a thing for me, but I didn’t know S did, and S was also dating at the time. Surprising or not, C is my current girlfriend. 

Prior to and at the time of this fallout, my roommates and I allowed C to sleep in living room of our four-bedroom apartment because she didn’t have a place to stay. S had a boyfriend whose apartment was down the hall, so she stayed with him, and B stayed in the living room there. Sorry if that’s a little confusing. Anyways, one day, I just felt like I wanted space and the apartment to myself, and my roommates of course, since they pay for it. So I asked C if she could spend the night with B down the hall- they were using my air bed and also had a couch for her to sleep on over there. She was kind and understanding and said yes. 

A few hours later, B, S and one more girl in that group who wasn’t too close with me, K, blew my phone up. They started accusing me of being a player. They said things along the lines of “you know C likes you, you’re just playing with her feelings! You let her stay with you and then before she gets too close you push her out!” And whenever I tried to explain myself, they wouldn’t listen. 

So, basically, from that moment on, I stopped going out and talking to them, except for C, because she was kind enough to understand or at least try to see that I wasn’t “playing with her feelings.” Soon after, in the early summer of 2017, I moved into the apartment where K and S’ boyfriend lived for other reasons.

Later that summer in August, C and I began dating. That’s when C told me that before I moved into that apartment, B, S and K would literally talk shit about me all the time in the living room, and sometimes another girl M would join in on the fun. So, my girlfriend and I stopped talking to them, and I began staying over at her apartment during the Winter of 2017. 

During the spring of 2018, my girlfriend apologized to K and S for not talking to them anymore- she’s like that, apologizes a lot, is quiet, shy. Instead of accepting her apology, K and S say things along the lines of “You made a bad choice for ghosting us. You shouldn’t have done that. You feel bad now for leaving but it’s your fault and that’s the consequences.” To this day, it still upsets me that they said that. 

TL; DR, my girlfriend and I left a group of friends I believed to be toxic, and when my girlfriend apologized sometime after, they turned it on her and told her she made the dumb decision.

My question is, are my girlfriend and I really at fault for leaving them? Are we the assholes in this whole situation? Should we have done things differently?"	TL;DR	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
bylgcr	2019-06-09 15:38:11	jeremy198930	AITA for calling out my neighbours for stealing my Tide pods.	"A bit of context to establish a pattern of disrespectful behaviour.

I live in the basement apartment of a house, the main floor is a separate unit as well as the upper floor/loft. We all moved in at the same time about a year ago and the landlord does not live in the house. Early on it became clear that unless I did most of the maintenance (snow shoveling, yard work etc.) it would not get done by anybody. I honestly don't mind doing it as I would rather look at a nice neat home and it gives me an excuse to get outside. That being said I have never even had gotten so much as a ""thanks"" from anyone else in the house.

I wont deny that this has built up a fair bit of resentment. The main floor tenants are also very inconsiderate with noise. Stomping in the doors and walking around with boots and hard shoes at night, having parties mid week and leaving their yappy dogs home alone barking all night on a regular basis. I have never complained to the landlord or the city about the noise and always addressed them directly in a respectful way rather than trying to get them in trouble.

Clearly this is about more than just Tide pods.

We share a laundry room with the main floor tenants and the top floor tenant has their own. There is a row of cupboards and we each have our own to keep laundry and cleaning supplies in and to this point I just trusted that no one would steal things like that from their neighbour. Well I had noticed that we seemed to be going through our pods rather quickly so I took a peek in their cupboard and saw that they didn't have any of our own so I decided to do a little experiment. I simply counted how many were in the tub waited until they did laundry and then counted them again. Sure enough there were two pods less. So I took the remaining pods out of the laundry room and left the empty tub on the dryer with a note that said ""buy your own, thief.""

For what it's worth if they had asked I would have gladly given them whatever they needed.

Later on that day one of them texted my S/O apologizing and saying they were ""in a bind"" and would replace the pod later. They played it off as if it was a one time thing which I do not believe although admittedly o do not have any proof one way or the other. Either way later on that day there was a whole new tub of pods outside my door. 

I am satisfied with the outcome. They took something that wasn't theirs, I called them out and they apologized and replaced. End of story. My S/O thinks ITA for being rude and creating a hostile living space.

Ex-dude was a chill guy and our entire friend group accepted him immediately, we miss him quite a lot. 

New dude is not really my cup of tea though, he is, in my opinion, rude and stuck-up. Though part of me can't help but compare him with her ex. My friend is much happier with her new man though and I know I should be happy for her but I can't stand him. 

He is one of those intellectual types and gives off the vibe that he thinks he is smarter than everyone else. He particularly seems to think women cannot possibly be smart. 

My friend insists on taking him everywhere with her so seeing her means having to be around him.

When we are together, he: ignores us, stares at his phone or asks my friend if they can leave already. What is worse is that my friend acts like a completely different person around this guy. She basically ignores our presence and talks only to him. She's all over him with some very hardcore PDA while my other friend and I are just trying to get a group convo going. 

He really does seem to hate being around his gf's friends and the feeling is mutual. 

AITA?

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention this, there's a big thing that started my dread for this guy. My friend was admitted to a mental institution for 2 weeks due to an attempt she made on her own life. My other friend and I visited her everyday while Mr Boyfriend wouldn't show up. When my friend finally asked him if there was anything wrong he said that she can't try to end her life every time something stupid happens and that ""what are you gonna do next time it happens, huh? Kill yourself?"".

He came over the next day after saying this crap and apologized. He brought her flowers and plushies. My friend immediately forgave him but that was a red flag for me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	202.0	17.0	0.0	0.0

A grom we normally skate with came over and told me there was a kid hanging out by our gear and looked suspicious. So I immediately skate over to where he is. The kid runs into the porta potty while I’m approaching him. I go and check my bag and behold, my wallet is missing. I run over to the bathroom he’s in and politely ask him to give the wallet back. After about five minutes of him denying taking anything he finally opens the door and hands me my wallet. He’s got a brand new longboard in the stall with him so I snatch it and said “it sucks when someone takes something from you huh”.

"Three years ago, I, a woman, ended my long term relationship with my then-boyfriend, because I felt like I was kidding myself and that I wanted to pursue the feeling that I was attracted to the same sex. I ended up in a relationship last year which lasted ten months, I'm now single again but also very much out and proud.


There is a small but thriving LGBTQ+ community in the area that I'm from. We have a Facebook group page. Last week, a woman (let's call her Sarah) posted on there asking if any of us may be available to house/petsit at short notice or if anyone could recommend someone who could, for six days. I agreed, because why not? I went there to meet the pets and chat properly to the ladies I'd be helping out (and meet their super cute cats and dog) and LO AND BEHOLD Sarah's partner is my ex's mum (let's call her Sue). I did always know Sue was a lesbian, but while I was with my ex, she wasn't with Sarah, otherwise I'd have known to except that when I first saw the Facebook post.


Anyway, it wasn't awkward at all, Sue was actually really pleased to see me, and she even said herself that she felt a lot more comfortable with me watching the pets than a Facebook random-o, and all was well.


I proceed to house sit. All is going well.


I have two days left of petsitting. Today my ex texts me. He's furious that I'm housesitting for his mum and Sarah. He said I should have asked him whether he minded first (I didn't even think to ask, as he's been out my life for a while, and he has a new mobile number anyway, I could've only contacted him through Instagram, which he wouldn't have accepted my follow request on anyway, as he didn't take the breakup well). He also said that he thinks that maybe I'm not actually a lesbian, as I've been single for over six months, and that maybe I knew as soon as Sarah posted that she was his mum's girlfriend, and this is all a desperate attempt to get back with him (it's not).


I've turned my phone off, but I texted his mum first to ring her landline if she needed to speak to me (I don't want to ruin the last few days of their holiday with this silly drama).

I was having a smoke across the street from a coffee shop I go to (ironically, to not get smoke in people’s faces) under an overhang to a cafeteria style restaurant where the employees often come out on their smoke breaks. It’s near an active side door that customers use, but it’s somewhat of an unofficial designated smoking area (at least to me and people I know who live in the area). Naturally, I don’t expect tourists to know this or respect this. 

A mom came out of the side door with 2 kids. I usually make an effort to stay out of people’s way, but most people simply come out and walk off, so I stayed on my bench. The mom asked me if I could move (so they could have the area to eat ice cream, it seemed like) out to a bench away from the overhang (into the very hot sun). I said no, and that she’s not any more entitled to the space than I am. I didn’t mention it, but my thought is that if it was just her, she wouldn’t have approached me. I’m a pretty big, built guy in a military town (Annapolis, MD) so most people assume I’m military and give me space, and she felt like, because she had kids with her, it was cool for her to approach me. 

I know the true NTA move would have been just to walk away when she asked and suck up the hot sun for a couple minutes, but I didn’t think it fair to ask me to leave a space I was at first simply because she wanted me to. AITA?

EDIT: a couple details- smoking is permitted at this spot, and it’s where people from other restaurants come out to to smoke. This is a known thing if you live there, but it’s not specifically designated with any signs or anything. There are a couple of benches there, and I was on one about 10 feet from her. She wanted me to leave the area entirely."	No A-holes here	0	0	402.0	53.0	0.0	0.0

"I wear a subculture fashion and recently moved to a new area and attended a ""swap meet"" with the community there. It is important to note that replicas are generally frowned upon in these circles. I sold a dress and bow accessory set that I had purchased second hand from an popular brand. When I bought the dress, the original belt was missing. I made a new belt for the dress out of a matching stripe fabric and included it. I made sure it was noted that the belt was not original and that this was reflected in the price of the dress. 

The buyer later found me on social media and asked about other matching accessories that I had posted pictures of before. I explained that those particular accessories were made out of a replica dress that I had mistakenly bought when I was new to the fashion. I later purchased the genuine dress, and then cut up the replica to make accessories with. I did not include any of the accessories made out of the art portion of the replica dress in the set.

I later got a message from the admin of the online community about the buyer's concerns with the sale. She claimed I sold her replica accessories without her knowledge, citing the bow and the belt. 

I explained that the bow was indeed genuine and that she could check for the brand's tag and a particular discrepancy only in the replica (they removed the popular brand name). 

I explained that the belt was made out of the replica dress, but not the art portion of the print, only the basic matching stripe fabric portion. I showed her an email where I had specifically noted that the belt was not original and that it was marked as such at the swap meet.

Her response was that the buyer was happy to confirm the bow was genuine, but still very upset about the belt. The buyer wanted me blacklisted from selling items at these sort of events in the future. The admin said that I wasn't banned , but that I was receiving a warning and that I should be more careful to not misrepresent my items.

Am I in the wrong here? I feel that I made clear that the belt was not original. It's just a black and white stripe, not the art portion of the dress. But I did take the fabric from the replica, so I can kind of see their side. The buyer has also been talking poorly about me to other people in the community which has gotten back around to me, and that doesn't feel great. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byl9i8	2019-06-09 15:20:00	finnAndJack	AITA For not having told a friend that a girl didn't want to hang out with him ?	"Hi,

It's been almost 4 years from now. I was in a group of friends and was pretty close from one. One day he presented me a girl (a friend). She was very cool and immediately I started chatting with her, talked on discord etc … But then my friend suddently became jealous, he told me that me being close to her opened his eyes, that he loved her.

&#x200B;

After he said it to me, I was a bit confused. I felt stuck between them. I asked her if she loved him. She said me that she wasn't sure to love him, and that if he asked her she would probably say no. It lasted several months, I was stuck in the middle, liked them both, but i felt like a tension.

&#x200B;

My friend talked of her everyday to me, that he wanted to ask her to hang out … I didn't want to say him ""she Don't love you, forget it"". 

&#x200B;

So here is where I think i fucked up. I pushed my friend to ask her. She said no and things became really really bad. My friend was so pissed that I didn't tell him that she would say no (he knew because i told him after that I thought it woudn't work). All that story ended by me leaving our group of friends (I didn't feel confortable anymore), losing a very good friend and same for the girl. I couldn't talk to her anymore after what happened. So I ghosted everyone and stayed alone.

I still miss them both time to time, and all that group of friend that I lost. 

So guys AITA for not telling him that she didn't love him ?

So my family and I are out at one of our favorite restaurants the other night, just finishing up, and our server comes by and drops the following on us:

If you’re going to tip, leave it in cash, otherwise, don’t worry about it. The owner has been taking all of the credit card tips.


— WTF?!

This isn’t cool. This isn’t cool for so many reasons.

I don’t have cash on me, so we sign the slip and head out, and I pop over to an ATM and pull out some cash and go back to give the server a tip, and they rush me outside.

Apparently the owner is there now, and even if I give them a tip now, the owner will take it from them. ?!?!

I mention that they should go to the department of labor because this is quite illegal, and they say it’s a new policy and they are hoping it goes away soon and they’re worried that if anyone does anything they’ll all get fired and etc...

Which I get.

But... not only is this illegal on the employer-employee end, in my mind, this is fraudulent against the customers, right??

The customer leaving a tip is intending it to go to their server and serving staff (maybe busser, maybe cooks, whatever the deal is at that place). Definitely not intending to arbitrarily pay more for their meal to the owner.

I haven’t done anything yet, but the thought of doing SOMETHING to report this just won’t leave my head.

Now my parents seem disappointed in me for not going and it makes me feel really guilty, because I haven't hung out with my sister in a while because I prioritsed my exams first and had to study for them.

byl33n	2019-06-09 15:02:54	chronicchange84	AITA for thinking I would owe a girl's SO an apology as well if I violated her trust?	"This came to mind after reading a certain trending AITA post. To be clear I think the OP was completely in the wrong from the moment he saw she had a lot of karma and decided to check her post history. I'd even go as far to say he was more than an asshole and is also gross and dense, and probably very socially ignorant to think anything he did was accepable. Anyways back to me...

I think it would be appropriate for someone to apologize to a girl's or anyone's SO if I did something to disrespect her or violate her trust. My reasoning would be that by violating someone, I would also be violating that person's SO since a SO is supposed to be someone's other half?

Of course it would only be after things where settled with the girl first. I know a girl is not the property of her SO. An example would be if I got drunk and accidentally made an inappropriate act or comment towards a girl. I would apologize to the girl and try everything thing in my power to make things right with her first, and if I was able to smooth things over with her I would feel like I needed to apologize to her SO and apologize for undermining his position as her SO. 

I feel like I would have to let him know I would never try and go behind his back with her but mostly let him know that I was sorry to her for what I did. I guess it's kind of to show respect and let him know I'm not just an ass.

I hope I was able to explain what thoughts are. I genuinely want to know if that is an antiquated point of view so I can change.

Edit#1 An example of what I mean by apologizing to the SO would be this. ""Hey man, I'm sorry for what I did. I would never purposely do anything to hurt her or your guy's relationship.""

I was also asked if I would apologize to a girl in a reversed situation, and I would feel like I would.

EDIT #2: I shouldn't have used the word ""inappropriate act"" It sounds way more than what I meant. I was thinking of something a lot milder than it ended up sounding.
Your comments were harsh and at first a little hard to swallow but I accept them. It's always hard when you find out the way you where raised and have lived most of your life is not correct. I was raised in the south but now live in a very progressive NW city so I have had a lot of growing to do these last 8 years. Being on Reddit as also helped a lot. A lot of my friends are women that are married or in serious relationships, that is why I wanted to check my point of view before it ever had an effect on my friendships. After reading all of your comments I have tried to think of a situation where I would need to apologize to someones SO, and can no longer think of any.
I also should not have used the example of drinking. I was also trying to think of a situation where someone might say something they instantly regret, and I thought of drinking. In hindsight that was a bad example. I don't actually drink much, having a glass of wine at a friends house or wine tasting with friends is about the extent of it.

The store included a grocery manager, we will call him Stefan, his girlfriend, Molly, who no longer worked at the store, Molly’s younger sister, Natasha, and a bookkeeper named Kristi, who had a best friend working there named Alex.


I had a crush on Kristi and she comes onto me strong. She sends me unsolicited nudes after a week of asking for my snap. Should have been a red flag. We start dating and she would break up with me a few days later. Then she’d ask to hangout and beg for me back. This started a few months of her being a very emotionally manipulative partner. I’d always agree to date her again because she made me feel like it was my fault we kept breaking up.


One day I’m really bummed out and talk to my friend about it, who is dating Alex, her best friend, at the time. He shares with me screenshots of a convo between Kristi and Alex, where Kristi admits she has been sleeping with Stefan, the grocery manager dating Molly, to help me get over her.


I was working with Stefan in grocery, so at lunch I ask him if it’s true around the other dudes in grocery. He says yes, but it was a one-time thing and what he has with Molly is better. The guys fist bump him. 


Kristi asked me to hangout again, likely to beg for me back since she broke up with me a week prior. This time I confronted her and said I don’t want to date her if she’s doing this. She denied it so I told her what Stefan said. This made her jealous and angry, to the point where she admitted that they sleep together all the time, including that morning! She then says that she has Chlamydia, meaning Stefan has it, meaning Molly must have it. But Molly would never find out unless she knew Stefan was cheating. 


At work Natasha and I begin to develop a relationship. I ask her out. The day of our date, Kristi and Alex invite her to breakfast and try to talk her out of it. Later that day, Kristi calls me telling me she hopes I die in a car crash. Just because I’m about to date another girl after Kristi broke up with me for the 100th time… 


The date went well. At work the next day, Kristi is extra mean to me, abusing her position to make me do extra chores. I am so fed up I walk out of the store. Natasha calls me that night and asks me what’s up. I tell her to meet me for lunch the next day. 

At lunch, I tell her everything, with permission from Alex’s now ex boyfriend to show her the screenshots. She ends up telling Molly, and then people at work find out, and Molly called me asking if it’s true and thanking me. She breaks up with Stefan, Kristi calls the store to quit, and I feel like I detonated a bomb in the store. I just didn’t think I should have gone into a relationship with Natasha, who is wonderful and I’m still dating to this day, without sharing this news with her about her sister.

We had just under 2 weeks to do it. I frequently asked her how's the sketch going... She always said that she's almost done. She sent me the complete sketch this morning.

Tomorrow it's supposed to be finished. Not a lot of time. She had almost 2 weeks to finish the sketch, mind you.

It was really nice though. Just as I started the lineart I realized that something is wrong. She forgot about 2 people. Well, alright, I can fix this but I was still pretty annoyed. It was her respobsibility, but ok.

So I messaged her explaining the situation. She got the messages, but didn't read them. So I called her. And again. And 4 more times. She didn't pick up, she didn't write back.

I decided to text her little sister. She said that my friend's at home, probably playing games or drawing. I got mad. So I asked the sister did my friend have her phone with her. She did.

At this point I started to be really mad at her. She had her phone, and I messaged her and called her every 20 minutes or so. Why the hell didn't she reply?

She finally messaged me, and then proceeded to say that her parents took her phone. Which doesn't really match what the sister said, does it? Also, her mother was not home then. Huh.

I left an angry message saying something like ""Wow, you really helped me just now. I'm almost fucking impressed."". When she finally ""got the phone back"", I called her to ask why did she forget those two people and to confirm the names of some of the people on the drawing. Her explanation was ""Well, she didn't send me her picture so I had no reference"". She never even asked them for a picture. She never came up to them. For 2 weeks.

I'm really mad at her about this. I think it's just very irresponsible. I think she's mad at me though. So that's why I'm not sure.

AITA in this situation? Or is my anger reasonable?

Edit: typo. Also I messaged her saying I'm sorry cause I don't want her to be mad at me, but I'm still kinda angry at her."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	213.0	39.0	0.0	0.0
byl0c8	2019-06-09 14:55:24		AITA for saying no to my mother bringing her two dogs to my house when I’m bring home a newborn?	"I’m currently 7 months pregnant with my second child. My mother and I have discussed a few times now that she would like to come and take care of my 4 year old when I go into labor so my husband and I don’t have to worry about arranging other childcare while we are at the hospital. Yesterday I went to pick up my daughter at her house ( she lives 1.5 hours away) where she had been visiting for 5 days at my moms request. From the moment that I walked in her poorly trained dogs were barking and did not stop even after I greeted them. One of the dogs is a 5 month old puppy that she says is housebroken, and while I didn’t mention it, I could smell dog urine so I doubt that is entirely true. The older dog is a fully grown but still barks constantly. It is totally obnoxious and gives me spikes of anxiety when I’m there. Anyway, my mom asked me if I wanted her to come and take of my daughter while I labor and I said yes. She then said “well, I will have to bring the dogs, is that ok?” I looked at her and said “ no, absolutely not.” She got pissed and said “well I can’t afford to board them” and I shrugged and said “I didn’t ask you to” she then said “ I just spent a week watching your kid!” And I said “ I cannot believe you would expect me to be ok with two barking dogs at my house when I will be bringing home an infant.” She called me a witch. I cannot understand why she didn’t even try to come up with a plan for dog care when she agreed to come watch my kid, is it my responsibility to help her find dog care? 

She knows I hate them. My step dad can stay home with the dogs ,it will be two days, tops- although they only have one car so he would be without a car. He is also retired and never goes anywhere so I can’t imagine that being a problem. Plus they live next door to my uncle who has a car if there is an emergency. She could also ask my brother to take care of the dogs while she is gone as he only lives a few miles away. 

I cannot over emphasize how annoying these dogs are. You can’t even hold a conversation in her house. She also acts like these dogs are children and talks about how tired she is from being up all night with the puppy and what time she puts the dogs to bed. For the record, I don’t hate dogs. I used to have a dog and when that good boy died, I was devastated. I hate these dogs. When I said hi to the older one yesterday he nipped me on my nose. She said “ oh he’s just excited”. Unacceptable. A full grown dog should not nip (bite) anyone if it is properly trained. And she’s been “retired” for ten years and has plenty of time on her hands to train them. So, AITA here?"

bykywd	2019-06-09 14:51:35	hannahville	AITA for getting mad at my friend who claims to fail many tests but ends up doing well?	"I’m in high school, and my friends and I are in all honors classes and get good grades. School has always come naturally to me. I was the valedictorian in my middle school and am most likely the top of my class now. However, if I do end up getting a bad grade, it’s honestly not that big of a deal to me.

On the other hand, one of my friends is an extreme overachiever. She studies like there’s no tomorrow and stresses out and talks about school all the time. It gets old and annoying fast. The worst thing she does, however, is whenever she feels a slightly bad feeling about a test, she’ll freak out and claim she failed. One time, she was hysterically crying and wouldn’t hang out the whole weekend. She ended up getting an 86. (She still claimed she failed, even though I told her below a 70 was failing, to which she said that she’s “entitled to have an opinion on her definition of failing”).

This week, she claimed she got a 50 on one test and that she “only knew 2 questions.” She talked about it CONSTANTLY and was up in arms about it. She ended up getting an 87. I was pissed (because she does this all the time) and told her to stop doing this. She said, “I thought I got a 50 and I got an 87. Not a good grade in my opinion but it’s better than what I thought I’d get. I can have whatever priorities or opinions on what’s a good grade and what’s not.” 

I know she’s not doing anything inherently wrong, but it brings all of us down when she complains constantly and ends up doing great. And I know this sounds mean, but I want her to actually fail for her to see what it’s like. Ugh. This whole situation is annoying.

Edit: I don’t want her to fail. I’m constantly supportive of her and she’s one of my best friends. I just want her to see how she’ll be perfectly fine and life will go on, even if she does fail a single test."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1378.0	373.0	0.0	0.0

bykwfi	2019-06-09 14:44:39		WIBTA is I fired an employee due to her smell?	"Hello everyone,

I am an Of Counsel Attorney/Human Resources employee with a law firm - my main job revolves around hiring and firing employees where I do some litigation on the side.  I absolutely love bringing in new talent to the firm, but as you can imagine, letting people go can be extremely difficult for obvious reasons.  It is the one aspect of my job I wish I did not have to do.

Before I go any further, I want to let it be known that I have Anosmia, which is essentially an absence of smell or not having the ability to smell.  I've had it ever since I was a kid but it has never affected me.

Two months ago, the Managing Partner of the firm hired a young lady as our Receptionist, let's call her Sam.  Sam is a very friendly and upbeat employee, very happy to be here and is doing a great job thus far.  However -- several employees, and even a few clients have expressed their concern that she has an odor that follows her everywhere in the office.  I do not smell a thing, neither does our Managing Partner who hired her.  Several employees have stated that the smell gives them migraines and are unable to work.  Last week, one of our biggest clients loudly mentioned a ""fishy"" smell after walking past her desk.  I have e-mails from people all over the office asking me to do something about this.

My plan is to have a professional and personal conversation with her to see if there is any way we can come up with a solution to the issue.  I know it can be several things - a medical issue, laundry detergent, sweat, or anything else beyond her control which I fully understand.  

However, as a law firm, a being a wonderful first and last impression is paramount in this line of work.  We can not be missing out on clients or having our staff be anything but 100% productive while doing their jobs.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I am at a standstill and will not know what to do if this continues.

Ultimately the Managing Partner has given me the responsibility of resolving this.  I absolutely love her work but also have to think of the best interests of the firm as a whole.

bykvx5	2019-06-09 14:43:18	LordWizrak	AITA if I wanted to work at my uncles company but asking for money for doing so?	"Ok, back story. I’m 16, just done my IGCSE and have a few months of spare time with nothing to do. My uncle owns a pretty successful water works company that I wouldn’t mind working at. But if I do work there, my dad says I shouldn’t be earning money because:

1) It’s family
2) I’m not qualified to do anything professionally

Now, I get the “you’re not qualified” part. My job there might be simple, maybe just handling paperwork or maybe preparing presentations at most, etc, but my intention is to go there to gain an understanding of the office environment and what the corporate world will be like. But my intention to work is also to earn some money because, as everyone does, want to have some money.

My uncle is probably willing to give me minimum wage (I don’t mind at all) but my dad is incredibly adamant that I don’t take it. I am really conflicted right now, I don’t know what to do in this situation.

EDIT : OK, just to clarify, and maybe add info to what may be required to get an answer to this, my dad is an incredibly successful businessman with more money than sense. However, he is also known within the family to be incredibly stingy with money. Could that have affected his input to this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	687.0	128.0	0.0	0.0
bykuvw	2019-06-09 14:40:31	throwaway344939292	AITA for asking my brother to pay back the recurring charges he caused on my credit card?	"Last summer, my younger brother asked me to use my credit card to pay for his Xbox Game Pass. There was a sale where a monthly pass was only two dollars. He agreed to pay it back in change, and he did (he was too young to have a credit card at the time). I had allowed him to make small purchases before, and he had always paid me back.

Since the amount I paid ($2) was so small, I didn't think much of it after paying the bill for that month. I have no access to my brother's Xbox account, and he didn't say *anything* about auto-billing. The month after I received the 2 dollar charge, I was not charged anything. So I assumed that this was over and essentially forgot about it.

Fast forward to this week where I opened my credit card statement to find a charge for $13, billed as a monthly Xbox payment. I am being completely honest when I say that I had never noticed this before. I don't know how I didn't notice. Maybe once or twice in the year I had assumed that the 13 dollar charge was because I let my brother buy some other small thing. I am embarassed that I didn't notice. 

After discovering the charge this week, I called my bank and asked what it was from. I honestly thought that it was credit card fraud, and so did the bank at first. Especially since I don't have an Xbox account or own an Xbox. I was shocked to hear the bank rep say that this was a RECURRING charge, and that it had been going on for 8 months (in addition to the initial $2 charge). This came out to almost 120 dollars in total.
Calling Microsoft confirmed that it was in fact my brother's Xbox account that had racked up these charges. He had never cancelled auto-renew. 

At first when I showed him the printout of the payments he was defensive, claiming that he didn't notice since he didn't use his Xbox any more. He said ""you didn't notice either, so I'm not paying for any of it"". 
After a heated discussion he agreed to pay half of the charges, but still insists that it was my fault for not reminding him, and that he doesn't really owe me *anything*. 

I understand that I should have checked my statements more diligently, and I am at a loss as to why I never noticed something out of the ordinary when I DID review them. 

However, I'm still hurt and disappointed by this. Is asking him to pay back the full balance unreasonable?
I trusted him as I had done before with my card, and I had no reason to doubt him. He is the only person that I have ever let charge ANYTHING to my card. He won't apologize and doesn't seem to feel bad about this at all. 

Finally, even after the auto renew was turned off this week, I am still being charged for the month of June. If he doesn't agree to pay the balance, I am planning to dispute the most recent charges with Xbox and if that doesn't work, with my bank.

Just wondering if this is a reasonable approach given the situation. Thanks for your advice."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"So yesterday I was walking up and down a public boardwalk playing Pokémon Go since it was Community Day. At one point I noticed there was a wedding congregation off to the side of the boardwalk in some grass since the boardwalk is very scenic in places being right next to the ocean.

The boardwalk runs east to west, so the wedding congregation was to the south of the boardwalk. I was walking by the congregation on the boardwalk looking at my phone catching Pokémon when suddenly some of the guests and venue staff (I guess they work for one of the buildings nearby) started yelling at me to get out of the way.

Initially I was extremely confused because I didn’t see anything to get out of the way of, so I gave the staff member a confused look and he pointed at something, which turned out to be the bride waiting off to the other side of the boardwalk (the north side to keep the geography consistent).

Now in my opinion there is no way I could have seen the bride off to the side unless I physically turned around because she was sort of hidden behind some plants. While I continued to walk I asked the staff member “where should I be walking?” and their response was again “get out of the way”. Again I asked “where should I walk?” and got the same response. 

At this point I decided the best way to get out of the way was just to continue walking until I was past the wedding but I was still getting shot dirty looks by the guests. 

So AITA here? I felt like a jackass for walking through but at the same time is it reasonable for them to block the whole boardwalk when it’s a public place and not give people an alternate route to walk around?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	28667.0	447.0	0.0	0.0

"I hired a contractor to redo the bathroom because it's really old and my family and I are planning to sell the house. The contractor came, gave us the estimate and told us that they can get this work done in about three days. We bought all of the equipment and waited for him on Saturday. He did not come. He messaged us telling us that his wife was sick (appendicitis) and he took her to the hospital and that he would be there on Monday.

On Monday and Tuesday, he came and did his work but he didn't come on Wednesday. I called him, left him a message and he came the next day at 12pm and told us he was at the DMV that's why he couldn't come on Wednesday. He didn't come on Thursday and only came on Friday for two hours after telling us that he was late because he took his wife to the doctors. He said he would come early Saturday (yesterday) at 9 am and he would get most of the work done. He didn't come yesterday and I don't think he'll come today. What was supposed to be a three day project is now over a week and I am getting a little frustrated.

I understand if it is family trouble or something else and I just want him to shoot me a text to explain why he's not coming. Family is important. If his wife is sick, take care of her. She is more important that this but because he hasn't replied back at all, we are stuck with with a half finished work and no explanation.

&#x200B;

Also, I forgot to mention. He always misses his time. He says he will come at 9, he arrives at 11. He says 10, he comes at 1.

&#x200B;

Edit:  The dilemma I'm facing is that what if his wife is sick and she needs surgery. It's appendicitis! That's horrible. What if he's with her and I am just being a bother because he is worried about his wife more than this job and he doesn't have the time to be on his phone.

There is a lot of what ifs and uncertainty.

Also, we live near a really good school in a really good school district. So there is also a time crunch to get this house ready before July so buyers can look at the house before buying it but still even with that appendicitis? That's really horrible and scary.

In my early 20s, a circle of friends and I loved this fun, albeit immature, guy we'll call LI. He's a hyper competitive guy but always seemed extra fixated on challenging me. Said maturity and competitiveness got worse with each passing year.    


By our mid 20s, he got caught on this loops where he would repeatedly say, ""I'm going to bang your sister,"" ad nauseum. After I called him out on it in front of a bunch of our friends and thoroughly embarrassed him by reminding everyone how a guy he hated in high school was currently dating my sister, his immaturity and general shitty behavior went into overdrive.   


He PMd me on every social media account I had with, surprise, ""I'm going to bang your sister."" Outside of her romantic interests treating her with proper respect and care, I don't care about my sister's love life in the least. Don't know why he thought that line would get to me. But the creepiness, disrespect and immaturity was wearing thin.   


He seemed to come to his senses and asked me to come meet him at a bar to hash things out. I agree. His apology started out okay enough, but ""... so sorry about all that. But I'm going to bang your sister someday. You know that, right? I will."" (Narrator: He did not.)  


Then I  completely cut him out of my life. Told circle of friends never to invite me anywhere there's a chance he'd come. They obliged. Circle and I slowly grew apart. I'll never know how much was because of LI vs natural life flow.   


Five years after that, we have a chance encounter where he says we need to ""bury the hatchet"" and asks for my phone number. I give it to him knowing full well it's blocked and had no interests in undoing it. The next day at the same music fest, I spot him standing by himself in the wings, watching my every move for about 3 minutes. Fucking creepy.   


By happenstance, a mutual friend of ours, let's call him SB, that I'm still fairly tight with gets engaged. SB informs me he wants me both me and LI to be groomsmen and might make me best man. I thought about it for a week and then informed him there was no way in hell I would be in the wedding party or go to a bachelor party with someone that disgusts me. Sure, it's their day, but it's also my life.   


Understandably, SB and his fiance', who I'm also friends with, are pissed. However, SB decided at the last minute he was not coming to my destination wedding last year due to a ""lack of funds."" Sure, it was pricey and inconvenient as hell. No offense taken. However, he seemed to have plenty of funds when he went to a Vegas bachelor party a month before our wedding.   


SB and fiance' asked me to reconsider a few times now. I'm sticking with my decision. They haven't made theirs."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Me and this girl were set up on a blind date by this girl's own mother and our first date was simply a movie. On said date, my mom had dropped me off and also met my girlfriend for the first time. She got a picture of us together, introduced herself, etc and after I asked her about being an exclusive couple on our second date, me and my mom set up a camping trip for the three of us, since my mom wanted to spend more time with her and she's also an EMT who's very into the great outdoors, so it seemed like the ideal situation. My girlfriend had never been camping or fishing before and I also thought it to be a good way to get her into it and try something new.

And on the camping trip itself, she didn't seem very into it. There were times when I'd be trying to set up camp or prepare fishing lines and she would just be awkwardly standing around and staring into space. She wouldn't be offering to help me or interacting with my mom or anything. And I got my hopes up about the two of us snuggling by the campfire, but she just awkwardly sat on her own little rock and just stared in the flames. I put my arm around her, but she didn't reciprocate in anyway.

And when I told my friend about what I did, he just simply stared at me and said ""You're fucking weird."" I asked him what he was talking about, but he just simply said ""No, I'm not talking to you.

It is a three story building filled with tons of activities for kids of all ages and a great way to let your kids explore freely. 

Third floor is solely an art exhibit. 

Second floor is a music center, innovation/building center, and a water center. Intended for older kids 5+

First floor is a mini city. This is where we spend most of our time. The older two (6 and 4) run off to play as I make my way to the toddler area. This is a small gated space intended for children 3 and younger to play without being trampled on or getting in the way of older kids. They have a wooden fence built around the play area that is waist height and a gate that is intended as the entrance so parents can enter and sit with their toddlers. Since I have a child who is not quite two this is the perfect place for him to play. 

When I get to the toddler area I see a child who looks about 10 and is playing with the styrofoam blocks. Her parents are blocking the entrance and when the girl sees us she closes the gate so we can't enter. Since the gate and surrounding fence are only waist height its not difficult for me to pick up my son and place him gently over it and let him play. She scowls at my son and tries to keep all the blocks to herself. I call my sons name and say ""look at the pretty flowers"" attracting his attention to them instead of the blocks. The girl quickly moves over to the flowers and tries to keep him from playing. 

Now I'm irritated. My first thought is that this child might be special needs and wants to play in an area less chaotic, totally fine. But her behavior is uncalled for. I ask her kindly if my son may play with her and she shouts ""no!"" I'm taken back and look at her parents for a little support. Nothing but blanks stares from them. Well, this is a designated area for toddlers and I then say to her parents ""my son has a right to play here whether she wants him to or not."" The girl stands up and kicks the blocks that she had been playing with and one hits my son. The parents give me nasty looks as they open the gate and walk off with their daughter. I'm livid. I call after them and say the least you can do is apologize on her behalf. She is absolutely out of of control and should not be around other children if she can't play nicely and share. They call me an asshole and leave the area. My son is not phased by any of this and is now stacking the blocks playing happily. 

I felt justified at first, but now I'm wondering if I overreacted. My son could have played in the other areas it just meant more work for me, chasing him and making sure he didn't get trampled by other kids.

I asked her if I HAD to go, and she told me that it wouldn’t look good on me if I didn’t go to the family. 

I told her that even if I could go, I can’t because I am a scheduled to work on my birthday, and my assistant is on vacation so there is no one to look after the work while he’s gone.

It’s also my birthday on the day of the funeral, and I have plans with my girlfriend.

Preface: I work two jobs, i go in at 6 am and get out around at 2pm, then go in again at 430pm till 1am. Her parents came around 4 so I said my hellos and eventually had to leave to work. 

I work at a resort/casino so I let her know to take her parents  to see the huge lake we have, I don’t think they are gamblers so not much else to do there. She later tells me that she’s in the downtown area with them.  A few hours later I take my new coworker (a good friend of mine) to the casino floor to meet a few clients and then go to the gift shop to get some coffee. I get a call from my gf asking if I was buying coffee and if so to get her some too and some things for her family, I tell her yea come in, apparently they walked by and called out to me by the door which sounds like a lie because the acoustics aren’t that bad and the cashier wasn’t too far from the door.  Anyways she comes in and I ask her where her family is at, she said they were sitting down somewhere in the lobby around the corner. I’m like ok.. apparently they only wanted some waters so we buy em and we walk out the door and she tells me “ well you got places to be so..” and take that as a queue to go back to the office 

She sent a text that she didn’t want to see my friends bitch ass face, I didn’t want to argue about anything, so I tell her well I don’t have anything to say about that. She continued and is mad that I didn’t say hi to her family and that they came to see me, I tell her well you sent me on my way and didn’t specify that you wanted me to say hi. We argue about that back and forth saying that I was disrespectful and embarrassed that I didn’t come out and say hi. And that i didn’t tell my friend to fuck off.i tell her that there was no need to tell my friend that and that her family should of went inside the gift shop OR she should of said let’s go say hi real quick.I told her that she sent mixed messages and was never clear on what she wanted to do. And I can’t read minds. 

I get home close to 2 am and she starts crying  in the couch( her parents are sleeping in the bed) and then she steps out side to cry some more, I go to her to comfort her and bring her back inside. She is mad mad like she tells me that she doesnt want to go anywhere with me, continues the argument which is circular at this point (example: why didn’t you say hi? You could of just told him to fuck off; why didn’t you initiate saying hi?) which I would give the same answers I’ve been telling her for the past many hours.

My friend and I (both females in our mid twenties) went out to dinner on a Saturday night. We both had been to CrossFit that morning and gotten breakfast after. In between that morning and night, we were both off running our separate errands. She had only had a protein bar in that time frame.

There was this Mexican restaurant I had been eyeing for a bit, and she agreed that we could go there. But being a Saturday night, it was a 45min wait. Not a huge deal for me, but I could tell my friend was starving and not a fan of that wait time. 

So we went to the bar, but all the seats were taken. I asked her if she wanted to fill up on chips and salsa  and that I didn’t mind standing. She grumpily said no she didn’t want to be full before getting her meal. And then said she was having an anxiety attack.

She also said that she didn’t like or want to wait, but she’d do it. I was not dead set on eating there. I even told her if she was starving, we could go somewhere else. She shot down that suggestion and said she knew I wanted to eat there and didn’t want to disappoint me. I asked her if she wanted to grab a sandwich or something nearby if she didn’t want chips from the bar, which she also shot down saying that she didn’t want to watch me eat. 

She then proceeded to sulk and then keep apologizing saying I know she’s not this mean. Well, luckily for us 45 minutes was only 20 and her mood drastically improved when we were sat.

My dilemma here is AITA for thinking she was just being a little diva at having to wait, and being even more difficult for shooting down every alternative option I offered? I really didn’t insist that we HAD to wait and that I would only eat there. 

She said she didn’t like the wait time. So I offered the option of going somewhere else. She shot that down saying that she knew I wanted to eat there, even though I assured her I’d live and there were other occasions. 

I then offered the option of filling up on chips and salsa? No, I don’t want to be too full to eat when we’re seated.

Do you want to grab a sandwich or something nearby? Noooo then I’ll have to watch you eat!

TLDR: friend and I go out to eat but there’s a 45min wait time which she doesn’t like. I offer other options like going somewhere else or getting chips from the bar which she shoots down.

"So basically, my friends and I all planned on going to a concert in September to celebrate friend A’s birthday. She is recently single and has really started hanging out with us all again and we’ve been hanging around a lot. We made plans for this concert because it’s a band we’ve all loved since we were younger and we figured why not? Friend B would also be coming and bringing her boyfriend, which wasn’t an issue when I assumed friend A & I would be without partners. But now friend A has started seeing someone new who she really likes, which is great. She invited him to come along to this concert with her, even though he doesn’t really know the band or anything.  I was super happy for her but told her that if both her and friend b we’re going to bring their boyfriends I probably wasn’t going to go just because I don’t want to be the fifth wheel, especially to two people who I know are big on PDA. She told me she knows how to be around people without making them super uncomfortable (“maybe a little uncomfortable” her words) and that I should come anyway and was kind of taken aback when I said that I probably wouldn’t. 
I don’t want it to be confusing: I am happy for her and hope her the best. I think I got a little selfishly happy to have her single again because she was/is my best friend who has proven to choose men over me and our friendship. I understand with certain things, you pick your partner but we went for nearly two whole years and only talked 5-6 times. I am being as encouraging as possible, but I don’t think I should have to sit through a concert and feel like the odd one out because I am single. 

TLDR; recently single friend already found a new boyfriend & invited him to a concert we all planned on going to, I do not want to go seeing as I will be the fifth wheel. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	7.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

We can't move as we own (or we could but it would be overkill). We have a 2yo who we usually play with in our living room but I tire of cleaning up that room every few hours because it can get a little chaotic.

My husband uses the office as a music room. He's got four guitars on the wall, a shelf of pedals, several speakers, a piano, etc. He takes is very seriously. So seriously it's his only real hobby. He likes to work on his car and gardening and stuff, but music is his first love.

I want to propose to him we use the office as a playroom but unfortunately this means the music stuff has to go. We have nowhere else to put this stuff as it does indeed take the room. This gives us our living room back and makes my life a little easier as we can sequester the mess in one spot which doesn't see much traffic. But this is the only thing my husband is truly passionate about. Maybe he can compromise and keep one acoustic guitar (because you don't need any of the other stuff for it).

Would I be the asshole? I want to ask /r/AITA before I make a sore mistake. 

If it changes anything, I'm a SAHM and my husband works as a bank manager. I used to be an accountant and I'm planning on going back to work when our daughter is 4 or 5 in school. She has some behavioral and play issues we're seeing an occupational therapist for and she advised to avoid daycare until this is all resolved. I'm stuck as a SAHM even if I don't want to."

There are multiple instances where she and I just don't see to eye because for one, I really think she needs to see a psychiatrist because she is a lunatic. Some examples include, fucking crying in the airplane when my sister accidentally spills water on to her and she just thinks the whole world is just against her. Not to mention, she has always played the victim card and everyone in the family is just done with her shit.

Ok back to the story, my mum does the majority of the house chores and the whole family helps out in ways that we all can. I do the laundry and boil water Mondays through Wednesdays and my sister does Thursday and Friday (we only take back the dry clothes and fold them). My mum does the weekend and also washes the clothes and hanging them out to dry on the daily. I feel that the system works and my sister and I have always been okay with this. I get that she's doing the majority of the workload but we're busy people too. And we're doing whatever we can to help. She, on the other hand, goes into the streets and starts yelling at me for not doing enough chores (all the neighbors can hear this btw) and it's just fucking annoying. If friends were to drop me off and she's out on the porch, she'd yell at me in front of them. Every time I bring up ""just let me know which days you want me to do the chores or what you want me to do, point blank"" she in turns yells back at me with ""IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT CHORES YOU NEED TO DO, THEN YOU DON'T DESERVE TO STAY IN THIS HOUSE, JUST LEAVE""

I guess it's hard to put years of resentment into a paragraph but I'm just so done with her. I can't move out because it's not a tradition that we leave our house before we get married. She says words like ""leave and get out"" just to spite us because she knows I can't do it. I just feel like she thinks I'm an ungrateful child even though she wasn't there when I was growing up and now that we're older, I try my best not to be at conflict with her, so I avoid her. She has always been abusive emotionally. I work, so I fend for myself and don't ask for a single cent. As mention, traditionally, I'm supposed to stay in my parents' house till I'm married and therefore, staying in my family house rent-free, is a given. I just don't get why she does this.

So tonight myself, my partner and 2 friends went out for dinner tonight and we were having some good banter and showing eachother unflattering and cringe photos of eachother. The unflattering picture in question was a bad hair do with a serious face, we all thought it was hilarious and my partner was laughing too and also said “don’t send it to anyone” and thought he was joking then as he was laughing.

Cut to chase, my friends hung out with us after and I sent my friend the pic and my friend thought it was hilarious and showed my partner said photo and he was not very happy. They left not long after and my partner didn’t say much the rest of the night so I asked what’s up and he told me he was quite upset with me saying how he didn’t appreciate me sending the photo even though in the past he sent an unflattering photo of me to one of his friends. 

So I sent a message to my friend asking her to not send it to anyone because I didn’t realise I hurt him and my partner found out I sent that and got even more upset saying she’s going to send it to everyone (she isn’t that kind of a person) and I just thought I was being helpful sending that message.

So cut to this as of lately he’s been saying a lot how he hates gender stereo types of men how men can’t wear this colour, how me. Can’t wear a certain style of clothing, men this and men that and that how men can’t show emotions and women invalidate them and basically told me that I don’t care about his feelings because of this.

I absolutely care about him, I just thought it was a silly joke and sent the photo anyway even though he has send an unflattering photo of myself to his friend.

I’m truly sorry I sent it and wish I could take it all back (I thought he was overreacting a bit considering he sent a photo of me and I didn’t really think much of it cause I find it funny)

bykgx9	2019-06-09 13:59:05		AITA for asking my husband if I've gained weight?	"I'm a woman who has always had body image issues growing up. I'm of an average weight and build, but my weight fluctuates a bit because I eat when I'm stressed and/or depressed. I've never been skinny or obese, but I've never liked the way I look. Growing up, my family members would constantly taunt me about being fat and ugly (even though I didn't think I was.)

Right after I got married 4 years ago, I cut my toxic family out of my life. I knew it was the right thing to do, but I was still an emotional wreck. I got a lot of abuse from my family members. It was just an ugly and difficult time in my life. I ate my feelings and I gained some weight. Before it became obvious, I kept asking my husband if I was crazy or if I had gained weight. For about a year, he kept telling me no, that I hadn't gained weight and I ""looked great"". I pled him to be honest with me. I could and still can handle the truth. I told him that I would never get mad at him for telling me the truth. 

I wasn't fishing for compliments. I needed the brutal truth so I could work on my body if necessary. I've been gaslighted my whole life so I have a hard time trusting myself. I needed an outside opinion. My husband was the only one I trusted to give me honest feedback. 

I finally gained enough weight to warrant new clothes. That's when I realized that I had let myself go. Once again, I pled my husband to tell me the truth. After a long time of hemming and hawing, he finally blew up and said, ""Yes, you got fat! You look terrible! Work out!"" I was hurt, not because he called me fat (I needed to hear it), but because he lied to me for months and led me to believe that the weight gain was all in my head. 

Long story short, I started the keto diet and lost a lot of weight - about 50 pounds in one year. I looked great, I was feeling great. All was well. 

Last fall, I had to stop the keto diet because money was getting tight and we got too busy. So I begrudgingly started eating quick and easy carbs. Naturally, I started gaining weight. I wasn't sure if I still looked good or if I should start watching my weight again, so I started asking my husband for his input. He would blow up at me every time I asked him how he thought I looked. He'd tell me to shut up and stop annoying him. I made it clear to him that I would not let myself get fat again and I needed him to help me keep my body on track. 

Fast forward to now. I'm still gaining a little bit of weight but I still think that I look okay. I'm not sure though, so I ask my husband sometimes. He gets irritated and tells me that I look fine. This morning I asked him again. He blew up at me and said, "" Yes, you have gained weight. Work out! Do something about it and leave me alone!"" Then he yelled at me for irritating him ""all the time"" about my weight.

bykgmc	2019-06-09 13:58:02	lostandbefuddled	AITA for thinking my friend is in the wrong for bringing her deceased dog up just to make us feel bad?	"One of my good friends (R) recently lost her beloved dog. He was thirteen and died due to age related illnesses. R was still pretty taken aback and fell into depression. She didn’t contact a lot of us for a long time and after trying to initiate contact for a bit ourselves, we decided to give her space for a bit. 

R held a funeral service shortly after his death, which was a couple of months ago. I live two hours away from where she does so by the time I made it (there was unexpected traffic) for the two hour service most of it had been over. I couldn’t have left earlier than that either because it was my dog’s birthday that day. FYI I had been there for his funeral, this was just his funeral service. 

My dad got hospitalised in the past month. It was pretty serious, and due to this I barely contacted any of my friends. We also had summer vacations going on so I had no reason to see them (we’re all in the same college). 

I recently contacted R again, and she blew up at me. She told me I was the worst friend ever for not ensuring she was okay and not asking her how she was. She also told me I was a shitty friend for not making it to her dog’s funeral service on time. I was pretty baffled because this wasn’t like her at all. She told me I was such a narcissist that I was always full of myself and I couldn’t ever be there for anyone else. Mind you, I hadn’t told any of my friends about my dad because I just didn’t want any of them to know yet. 

I told her how I was going through stuff too and she mellowed down and things seemed to go back to being okay. Until recently, when I started seeing her on a regular basis again. No matter what happens, she’ll bring her dog up. I’ll give you and example. 

“Hey R, guess what! I’m going for a show this Saturday!”

“Oh that’s nice. I can’t go because my dog just passed away”

I was like WTF! I understand she’s really upset about this but I don’t know why she keeps acting this way. I don’t even know if I’m justified to feel this way because she did go through a lot but I don’t know why she’s acting like it’s our fault he passed away. AITA?

Edit: I think I should’ve specified what exactly I meant by ‘birthday party’. We had an exam that day so I got home at around 3. I didn’t throw a party for my dog, we just cut a cake my mom baked. The cake cutting got delayed because my sister hadn’t reached home from work yet. So we waited for her and I left for the funeral service AFTER that. I’d notified my friend I’d be late beforehand but that I’d make it earlier than I actually did. There was unprecedented traffic so the 2 hour trip took 2.5 hours. By the time I reached only half an hour of the funeral service was left which was mainly people chit-chatting."	Not the A-hole	0	0	80.0	35.0	0.0	0.0

"So, the friend in question is extremely confrontational, gets on her high horse, is incredibly argumentative and thinks she is always right. Due to this, she has lost friends, relationships and caused rifts with many people.

Until now, we've never locked horns and get on incredibly well. Last night I was making casual chit chat (she can be hard work to get conversation out of sometimes) and I asked if she had any recommendations from Netflix as she'd been having a Netflix day. This somehow made her flip. She went off on a rant saying how annoying it is, how I should watch what she's previously recommended (2 things which I haven't had chance to watch and Marvel films being another which I already said I'm not into and won't watch) how it's effort suggesting shows (in my books, that's not effort) and how it's her Right to rant at people and basically try to shout them down.

I've been nothing but kind and supportive to this friend and said this verbal attack was unwarranted, she thinks it was. I said she should learnt to bite her tongue sometimes and save it for the people who actually cross a line, as trivial things are not worth arguing over. Of course she didn't agree.

[the shoes in question ](https://www.ysl.com/dk/shop-product/women/shoes-kiki-kiki-ankle-boots-in-smooth-leather_cod11710754oh.html)

As you can see, they’re very plain and you can probably pick up a pair from H&M for a fraction of the cost. 

My dad isnt very rich but he’s never in my life. He never sees me but he occasionally sends me and my brother gifts to alleviate his guilt. He’s not with my mother and so I think this is his way of trying to buy our love. Obviously, I’m not going to look a gift horse in the mouth and my dad has a good eye for fashion so whenever he buys me stuff I’ll share with my mom and we’ll use the items he sends. This extends to my wardrobe too and this particular classmate will always aggressively ask if I’m rich etc because I wear stuff like CK socks and she thinks it’s obnoxious. I really don’t want to say ‘sorry, my dad shacked up with another lady when my mom was pregnant with my brother and so he sends us guilt gifts’ so I always say I found stuff discounted at t j maxx etc.

I was wearing these boots when I saw my classmate at a family occasion, because she’s loosely related to my aunt. She saw my boots and liked them, and asked where they were from. I didn’t really feel like going into the fact that they’re a branded shoe, just because my mother isn’t very rich, I don’t work, and I felt uncomfortable divulging how much they were. 

I lied and said my mom picked them up for me shopping and I’d ask her when I saw her. 

We went inside on the same day into my aunts home, and she has a rule where we all take our shoes off at the door. We did, and later on my classmate came up to me and said ‘I checked and your shoes are Saint Laurent, you’re such a snob that you couldn’t even tell me?’ 

I didn’t really even know what to say to her- on one hand I feel shit for lying but on the other I feel like she isn’t entitled to know my business.

"Okay so to the situation is between me, my girlfriend of a year and a half, and my friend since 3rd grade(now seniors in highschool)lets say Jim. A little bit ago my girlfriend told me she didn’t like Jim because Jim was saying stuff about her like that she didn’t treat me right or something around that it wasn’t really clear to me what was said. At the time me and my girlfriend were getting into arguments about me hanging out with people which is honestly a different story for a different time. So she tells me that the only solution is to not talk to him and since i have been friends with him for so long i tell her no and that i will find other solutions to this problem. My girlfriend goes on to tell me how I’m not doing everything i can to fix the problem if I’m avoiding the option of not talking to him and how I don’t care enough about her and how it physically hurts her that i would rather hang out with Jim and keep hurting her instead of making her happy and not talking to him anymore. So please tell me if I’m the asshole because i really hate hurting her but i also do not want to lose my closest friend.

Edit 1: Adding on because of points brought up i realize it was pretty dumb of me to not figure out what it was he said, i have a tendency to freak out when she gets mad and not ask for a lot of details because she goes out on a tear and just gives me example after example of how shitty and terrible i am for what i have done in the past and the current situation. 

Edit 2: the story for another time was that i had made plans with a group of people and told my girlfriend the night before, a little after that she asked if i could go to the mall with her and i told her i couldn’t because i had already made plans with that group of people. She got really mad and told me i was a horrible boyfriend and then posted it on her snapchat that i had ditched her for my friends and made her feel like i didn’t care about her. I understood her frustration that we don’t go on dates much as she lives pretty far from me, as well as that we both had a lot of school work, and i was busy with sports but that whole situation got really out of hand really fast and i believe led to more disliking of my friends including Jim."

"**In early January, a girl I lived with in college asked if I’d live with her again.** I said yes. She said she was aiming for sometime between June and August depending on a job. Then she asked if I could do June, and not long after that, if I could do May. I said yes. She told me she signed *something* with a company in February but hadn’t gotten a start date. That was more than 3 months ago. I’ve heard little since. I worried I was being annoying based on a lack of response, so I stopped bringing it up (we aren’t super close so we haven’t had much communication of any kind since). 

I vented to a close friend. **She wants to move and said in no uncertain terms that if things didn’t work out with the other girl, she’d live with me.** At first, I was hesitant to entertain the idea. I said I already told her I would (even though we hadn’t toured the complex let alone signed anything or made plans outside of agreeing that we were *going to*) and I **did not** want to give her an ultimatum. I also said I don’t want to make her (my friend) feel like a backup; I know all too well how that feels and it wouldn’t be fair to her for me to keep her in the kind of limbo I’d been stuck in. She understood and wasn’t in a rush to make a decision so she was fine effectively being my backup plan for the time being. 

What started as casually sharing cool Zillow listing with each other turned into full blown apartment hunting. The longer I went without hearing anything, the more convinced I was that she was trying to give me the brush off; she was the one who initiated it only to effectively go silent. I know what they say about assuming, but I’m non-confrontational to a fault and felt weirdly defensive about the idea I shouldn’t have to beg her to live with me or for info. I should’ve said something sooner but didn’t so this is the situation I have to work with. 

**I said I’d assumed for a while she wasn’t interested in living together, I don’t have any hard feelings and hope she doesn’t either, and that I have a friend who wants to live with me but since I told her I would live with her, I would, and to let me know. As someone who has been ditched and bailed on more times than I can count, the last thing I want is to do that to someone else. She responded that she’s still waiting for a start date and hasn’t made other plans but if I want to I can, she can’t be mad at me for “having my shit together.”**

My mom and friend are biased but think I should stick with my new plan. My therapist agrees; she said it’s ok to be selfish in this situation but I feel bad. I know I should’ve reached out sooner but I guess I thought if it were me, I’d make a point to regularly reach out to the other person to let them know what’s going on.

bykaq3	2019-06-09 13:39:10	sthgsthgthrowaway	AITA for not lending my mother money and criticising her money management?	"Throwaway because reasons.

TL;DR: Mother asks me to lend her money for cigarettes. I decline, due to me not wanting to support her addiction, and her already owing me a lot of money that I doubt I will ever see again. I criticise the way she manages money. She throws a fit.

Today, my mother [F38] asked me [M17] to lend her money - 50PLN to be exact. Not a lot for most people, but for me that's 2,5 months of pocket money if I dropped my sports TV subscribtion. My only source of income is gifts from the family that I get on special occasions.

Now, my mother doesn't have a job. She used to, and she is searching for one, but IMO she has too big expectations - she wants an office job (studied political science), but it needs to be part-time, so that she has time to pick up my younger brother [M7] from kindergarten, and - starting this September - from school. But let's be honest - how many part-time office jobs are there?

Anyway, I asked her what does she need the money for. She avoided the question - recently the answer was ""cigarettes"" and I refused. You see, she is a big smoker - I believe two packs a day? It's been like that since I remember. I want her to drop it, since it's bad not only for her, but also for me - even barring the health issues, other people including teachers have started to notice that I smell of cigarettes. Anyway, when I declined to lend her money for cigarettes the other day, she took it personally and said that all I do is ask for money myself. Pretty much the same happened today.

A few minutes later, she said that it's not just cigarettes, but also groceries she wanted to buy. I offered for her to make me a list of what we need, so that I can go to the store and get the things, with my money. She said she has stopped talking to me already.

Now, my mother's smoking isn't the only reason for me to decline. She already owes me 730PLN, which she swears up and down to pay me back once she gets a job. I haven't seen this money in over a year (or maybe two?), and I heard that excuse for months. Waaaay earlier (like, a few years earlier), she took 300-something PLN, but I had already come to terms with it being gone. She's been borrowing money from family and shady ""quick loan"" companies behind my father's back - which she always paid back. I guess I'm just low priority... I confronted her about this today, and her reply was ""I didn't ask you for advice. I asked you to borrow me 50PLN."" I can't recall if she called me a brat, but it's entirely possible. Later, she entered my room, crying and with a ""I didn't realise you think I'm a failure. Thank you for letting me know.""

Now, I feel like an absolute arsehole. Is it justified? I think she might be guilt tripping me somewhere. How can I proceed not to make the conflict worse? And most importantly, am I the arsehole (and in the wrong)?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

My cousin got engaged about a year ago, and her and her fiance are absolutely amazing people, I love them both so much and I'm so incredibly happy for them that they found each other and are getting married.

Unfortunately (or fortunately outside of this context) I got accepted into a study abroad program in Europe where I'll be for 5 weeks over the summer, therefore missing their wedding. I thought long and hard about whether or not to go for multiple reasons and their wedding was one of them. 

Eventually I decided to go and ever since then my family has been mad with me. The actual bride and groom don't seem to mind but my aunts uncles and grandparents have been posting passive aggressive things on Facebook that are obviously directed towards me, texting me in passive aggressive ways and generally making me feel horrible about leaving and missing the wedding. 

I bought the bride and groom a wedding gift along with a card explaining that I can't be there but definitely wished I could be and I felt like that was enough but now I'm not sure. We're not incredibly close but she's my cousin and I love her and now I'm worried that I made the wrong decision. Reddit, AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byk8y4	2019-06-09 13:33:40	MommaLight	AITA for being annoyed that my friend planned her daughter’s birthday party on my son’s actual birthday?	"So, a little backstory: my son’s birthday is today. My friend’s daughter’s birthday was almost a month ago, in May. My friend also has a step-daughter whose birthday IS today, however, the birthday party is not for her. The birthday party is for a kid whose birthday was in the middle of May. 
We (husband and I) opted to have our son’s birthday party (with friends) next weekend because there’s an annual festival that’s here this weekend, but we are having family over this weekend. My friend knew this, but still wanted to have her daughter’s birthday party from 1-4 today, and stressed that her daughter really wants my son to come. She hasn’t had any plans (over the past few weekends) but still opted to wait almost a month to have her daughter’s birthday party.  Also, although she usually doesn’t take her kids to the festival, she knows I ALWAYS take mine and she knows we’re having family over today. So now, on top of having to do the “guests are coming” clean up of my house, pick up a cake and fruit trays, go to the festival, and then have family over for 3 o’clock,  we have to squeeze in a birthday party for a kid whose birthday party was a month ago. I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed. 
So, AITA for being annoyed that my friend chose THIS day to have her daughter’s birthday party when her daughter’s birthday was a month ago? (I haven’t said anything to her about it, and probably won’t unless she asks)"	No A-holes here	0	0	32.0	26.0	0.0	0.0

So basically, to summarize the situation. I (kind of) made friends with this guy on Xbox, who I will refer to as “Sean” for this story. He seems like a nice kid (though he does get on my nerves sometimes but honestly that sort of thing is inevitable in friendships). The main issue though is when he wants to play with me.

We’ve been playing on a Ark: Survival Evolved server and we have a base on a boat/raft. Basically, at around midnight or 1 AM my time (Pacific Standard if it helps), he messages me if I can get on. I say yes, we play for a few hours, then I get off. Here’s the **issues.**

1) He’s in a completely different time zone (I don’t know which one), so when he’s messaging me at fucking 1 am it’s like, noon or early evening for him.
2) When we DO play Ark together we don’t get much done because honestly, I get tired if I stay up too late, and it makes me irritable and snappy.
3) He’s been asking me to play Ark with him, around this same time, EVERY night.
4) When I DO get off Ark to play something else he begs me if we can play some other game. And honestly, just even talking to him is getting on my nerves.
5) I can’t stay up till fucking 5 am every night, because I graduated high school and I’m going to need to find a job sooner or later.

So... **Would I be the Asshole if I were to tell Sean that I can’t do this anymore and that I just can’t play because of timezone differences, how late it is when he asks me to play, and that I may be getting a job soon?**

QUICK EDIT: I also forgot to mention that currently it is just me and him in the “tribe” (clan/group) so I can’t just like kick him out or something without coming off as a huge asshole. Though I can’t help but wonder if he has any other friends in his timezone that he could play with?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1216.0	293.0	0.0	0.0
byk7ta	2019-06-09 13:29:58	Kattevanger11	AITA for leaving the bike outside	"throwaway,

&#x200B;

My dad was working on something in the front yard and tipped my bike over (by accident?), he broke the shifter. He tried to fix the shifter but the mechanical part of the shifter itself was broken, he managed to fix it but some other parts got lost or broken. He started to rage and curse and starts accusing my mother although he doesn’t know whether or not she had to do anything with it (I don’t think she did). I become upset because now my bicycle doesn’t work anymore and I need it to go to school and work every week and use it a lot. I wanted to have a solution and tell him to give me money for a new shifter, since he broke it (by accident or not) because I think that he should give me money or atleast pay a part of it so I could buy a new one. I have little experience on tinkering with bicycles but after watching some videos on YouTube I am confident that I can replace the shifter and the shifter box.

If I would bring it to the bicycle shop it would cost around 30 – 45 euros to get it fixed, if I’d do it my self it’d only have to buy the shifter+shifterbox which would only be around 15 euros and hence cheaper. I told him to give me money so I could buy the shifter and he starts raging about how the bike should not have been in the front yard and that it was basically my own fault since I didn’t put in the shed, afterwards he starts explaining that I should’ve put the bicycle in the shed because it might get stolen (which has never happened) or that someone might tip it over (which is what he did) to which I responded that I never do that and that I might still use the bike to go to the shop or to the gym later after I’ve come from work or school, and that my mother does the same.

He starts raging more and more and tells me that I wont be able to replace the shifter after I wanted to do it myself and that'd be too hard for me, and I'd be unable to do it. I do not think that he felt bad for breaking my bike.  AITIA for being upset and requesting (partial)compensation to fix my bike?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byk6i2	2019-06-09 13:25:36	laerie	AITA for keeping 50/50 money I won at a benefit?	"My friend's father was dying of cancer and his family doesn't have a lot of money. They were struggling to pay hospital bills and also had to think about a funeral and headstone in the future as his dad was not getting better. These were the days before GoFundMe, so they had a spaghetti dinner benefit for him, where you paid for a plate, paid for a dessert, and they had a 50/50 and a Chinese auction. 

We spent money on everything. At the time, my husband and I were fresh out of grad school with shitty entry-level jobs, so we were really struggling financially. Loan payments were coming in on top of our living expenses, so we were incredibly aware of every dollar we spent. This was absolutely a no-brainer for us though and we didn't feel any anxiety about spending money here for our friends.

So as the night wore on, it came time to pull the names for the 50/50. I won. I can't actually remember how much money it was, but I think it was between $200-250. My husband and I were happy about winning obviously, because of our financial situation. Any little bit helped at that time. I was feeling a little guilty about winning since I knew it was a benefit and that their family really needed the money. I asked my husband if we should give the money back to them, or even donate some of the money back to them. We technically wouldn't miss the money since we didn't have it in the first place and the only reason we had it was luck. We kinda went back and forth but eventually settled on keeping it due to us being broke young adults. We did really struggle with the situation and only kept it because we were behind on bills at the moment.

After the raffles, people started to leave. We were sitting with our friends and heard a few family members say things like ""I was hoping to win the 50/50 because I was going to give you guys the money back,"" while giving us pointed looks. That made us feel even worse, but this money would really help us so we stayed put in our decision. When we left, I felt sick with guilt and called my mom for advice. She said that it was a 50/50 and if they didn't expect the winner to keep the money then they should have just had a donation bucket instead of a 50/50. She also knew our financial situation and said that we really needed the money also, and that we should keep it. That made me feel a little better, but I still felt guilty because I thought my friends might be mad at us. I don't know if they were or not, but we kept the money. AITA, Reddit?

TLDR: My friend's dad was dying of cancer and they needed money for hospital bills & funeral costs. They had a benefit with a 50/50 and I won the money. I didn't give it back even though some family members mentioned giving the money back if they won it because my husband and I were also struggling financially at the time."

byjzdb	2019-06-09 13:01:49	Cawoi	AITA for wanting to choose the guests that attend my 'surprise birthday'	"So my girlfriend decided a while ago that she would like to throw me a 'surprise birthday' now that we are moving into our own place together.

She invited (made a fb group I think) my friends who live back where I grew up and then some locals who are more her friends than mine. Unfortunately, due to logistics and planning the party couldn't remain a surprise so I know a few of her plans including her guest list.

Our house is quite small and my first issue is I do not know how many people we can handle over (of which I think she has overestimated). A number of my friends will need to stay over too. The dynamic I have with my friends is also very different to what I have with the other invitees.

I told her I would prefer to have just my friends attend this time and have the other guests over for a different event such as a moving in party. She did not take this well, I think partially due to some of the plans she has made for the day and also because she's not particually pleased with the idea of the inevitable beer-fest/ mtg card/lan party the party will be if just my friends attend.

Edit:
To be fair and make myself look bad this is for my 25th Birthday and this is a clear example of where I've failed to get out the student mindset in terms of parties."	No A-holes here	0	0	84.0	40.0	0.0	0.0

byjxrl	2019-06-09 12:56:40		AITA for refusing to get back with my Ex girlfriend?	"info: I'm on the spectrum and have never dated anyone before, so everything about this is completely foreign to me. We've known each other for a little over 2 months and went on 4 dates in total (worked opposite shifts/schedules and both mutually understood the time restraints beforehand)

The first 2 dates were pretty good

The 3rd date we go to the park. On the way back the glove box opens, or she opens it (I was looking at the highway) and she sees tampons inside. Immediately she pulls my sleeve demands an answer, and I give her one. They were my mothers, this was her previous vehicle. I saw no need to throw something unused away. But to her this was a lie. I try to reassure her again but she now has her arms crossed and insists I take her home, I comply and start heading that way. She begins to ask if I understood how I made her feel, I tell her that I'm aware she is upset but I cannot comprehend why. She gets upset and begins to tell me that I'm just like her previous boyfriends. It didn't hurt but it felt mean, The car ride was silent. I still said goodbye and apologized one extra time for good measure.

The 4th date we wipe the slate clean and go to a bar/grill. Things seemed normal until I started getting drunk (first time). In the lightest way I mention to her that I may not feeling okay (an understatement) and would like to go home early. She asks if it's her that's the problem and I tell her ""no, I'm just feeling very out of place and uncomfortable here"". She then follows with ""Why do you like me one minute and then hate me the next?"" Confused, I ask her to elaborate. She then abruptly leaves without word.
 
Again, I apologize for everything, via text this time. No response I check facebook the following morning to see that she had blocked and removed me. Upset with myself I tried to get back to normal everyday life.

2 Days later she asks to talk. She asks for a reason to why I left her,( yes I). I tell her that I never ended it and already apologized. She denies it. I mention that she hadn't responded to my messages and removed me on facebook (Showed phone) she now insists it's because I ignored her but I mention the text again. She walks off.

The next day she follows me to my part of the building in tears, telling me she loves me, demanding I give her a second chance. I politely tell her ""Sorry, but I'm not interested in going back into something that didn't work out. We can still be friends"" She rejects saying she cannot be friends with me and not be physical. I tell her ""Sorry, I just can't do that"" A co-worker over hears the short conversation and butts in that I ""Can't just do that, that's fucked up"" I then try to explain the co-worker the situation but she immediately cuts me off with ""I'm a psychology major, what you're doing is fucked up"" Confused, all I could muster up was ""What?!?""

byjxpo	2019-06-09 12:56:26		AITA because I don’t want to get extended family pictures?	"Background: my FIL has been remarried for 2 years since losing my MIL 10 years ago. I also have 2 SILs and we all have young children. FIL’s new wife also has 3 adult children. So essentially we are a blended family but because this marriage is happening so late in life (all the adult children are in our 30s and 40s) we are not super close. Nor do we have much in common.

One of the adult stepchildren, we’ll call her Jess, is very adamant about trying to force this whole blended family thing. She tries very hard to make us all do activities together because their dad was a POS who they never see and they just adore my FIL. He is a wonderful man and I’m very glad they like him. For us, because MIL died after a horrific battle with cancer, our outlook is less excited and gleeful to all be brought together; tragedy and losing one of the best women I’ve ever met is not something we celebrate. Although we like FIL’s wife and we happy he has companionship, It’s a loss for us and we wish MIL was still here. Our two families have just had different journeys getting to this point, and Jess isn’t very sensitive to that. 

This newest thing Jess wants is to get family pictures with all 24 of us. She mentioned it last year and we all sort of never made it happen, and now she’s really pushing it this year. She wants to give them as Christmas gifts to our parents, and has insinuated she wants this to be an annual thing. Our issues with this are:

1) We enjoy choosing gifts for people and we don’t want this to be our only gift to them every single year. She’s already done this to us multiple times and we’ve obliged her group gift enthusiasm. But now we see it’s becoming a habit and we want it politely get out of them.

2) Our daughter is a toddler and we plan on having another. We are in the season of life where we will be getting our own pictures of her and us throughout the year (family pics, birthday pics, Christmas minis, etc.) and part of the fun of that is doing it just the three of us and choosing our own photographer. It’s a part of parenthood we truly enjoy. Jess’s kids are older so for her this is an opportunity to get her one family picture in every year. We would not be using these pictures for anything except the gift to the parents. 

3) The stepsiblings have a smaller budget than us so we will not be using whatever photographer they choose for our own personal pictures. We are happy to be in them but don’t want our own separate family ones with the same photographer. Which means we also don’t want to pay as much as everyone else who will be doing their own sessions on the side. This is awkward to bring up. 

So....AITA for trying to think of a nice way to bring all this up to her? I barely know her or her siblings, I won’t be hanging a picture on my mantle anytime soon from these sessions. We are ok with doing it once but after that we think every 3-4 years is more appropriate than annually."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"About two months ago me and my bf went dancing with some friends, I started having really awful knee pain and had to leave, I insisted my bf stayed and I'd take a cab but he decided to go home with me. I felt really bad for making him miss out on the rest of the night but he's just a worrier ( not sure that's a word ). 

Anyway today is one of our friends birthdays and guess what ? I had some severe food poisoning from eating out so I'm at the hospital and probably will be for about two more days. 
I wasn't going to the birthday anyway because I'm recovering from the knee surgery and can't really dance yet but told him he should still go since he's closer to the birthday girl than I am and I couldn't make it anyway, he said he would but now I'm thinking if I told him I'm at the hospital he'd just rush here to see if I was okey and once again miss out on being with our friends or he would go and just keep worrying about how I am and not be able to enjoy himself.

He's always been very clear about not wanting us to keep secrets from each other and I know I'd feel a bit mad if he kept something like this from me but I just want him to have a good time and not keep missing out on these sort of things because of me. It's not like he could really do anything about it and my mom is here anyway so I'm not alone. I told one of our friends and she said it would be a dick move to just not tell him cause he might feel guilty afterwards for not being there for me in the hospital while he was out partying.

"We are from the Philippines and my mom is extremely religious. I am a closeted atheist since I was about 13. My mom had quite a tough-ish life due to (mostly) her bad decisions like not being good with money, refusing every good opportunity that came her way because she believed in ""signs from God"" (e.g. someone offered her a substantial amount of money for something she wasn't selling, she prayed and asked God ""if this is a bad decision, let person x come by my house this week"" but person x comes by our house 2-3x a week. While I told her it's a very good decision to sell, since person x comes by ANYWAY she follows her ""sign""). She's a single mom and I am her only child. So I always dreamt of giving her a good life.

I learned to not follow her mistakes, and I suppose this is why I became an atheist. I worked extremely hard because I wanted a different life from that of my mom. 25 yrs later, I became quite successful. Bought her a house, a car and an allowance each month. 

She never once thanked me. Instead, she thanked God. I ignored this at first, but then she got quite extreme. I mentioned to her that I did work pretty hard to get here, and she says things like ""This is God's reward to me, all those years of following him. I deserve/earned this"" and ""It was through my prayers and faith that He listened and gave you the strength to push through. If you think this was purely because of you, you are sorely mistaken!""

I am going to Australia for a holiday, I wanted to take her and she said something like ""praise be to Him! He loves me so much, he knew I deserve to have a vacation!"" I don't know why, but it rubbed me the wrong way and told her ""nevermind, I'm going alone."" 

She's upset, asked why and I said that I am so sick and tired of hearing her praise some Being for my hard work and love. She said I am being ungrateful and delusional if I think my success was because of ""just me working hard"""	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

For the project you were allowed to choose your own subject. We chose to make a tool that can actually be used if we deliver!

This is where the problem arises tho, because two of my group members are a couple. The gf isn't that good at developing and she was falling behind in knowledge pretty fast. We tried to slow down to her pace, but we won't be able to finish the product if we do that.

Eventually she was creating code and and all was good, or so we thought. I asked something about her code and she didn't understand it. So I kept asking and eventually found out that she didn't write it.

I went to the supervisor and he decided to give her an assignment where only she is allowed to work on. Now we're stuck with someone who keeps yelling about how hard everything is. So eventually she starts a discussion with me which was filled with personal attacks. It got the better of me and I responded back. Talking her down about how little she contributed and that she better not waste more time than she already does.

Our team is now split about which side to choose. Half sides with her(her bf and a friend of hers) and the other half sides with me. Should I've just shut up?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I come from a middle class family . We live paycheck to paycheck and as the eldest sibling in the household I'm very much aware of my parent's struggles every month . Eventhough they do provide me food , a place to stay , pay my school fees and stuff , I generally do not like asking them to buy me stuff or do stuff for me . 

For example if I have to print something for a school project I'll dread to ask them because I KNOW that they'll say they have no money and they're tired to bring me to a CC . If I want stack of A4 paper to do my assignments , they'll say that they buy me but they'll postpone it as far as they can before they're done with me nagging them and finally get me . 

As a result of this I've been chided and embarrassed by my teachers in school , and as a introvert that's your worst nightmare . I feel like I'm always burdening them with this everyday but one thing I do not like from my parents is how they point out that I'm being ungrateful ( for always nagging them to buy me stuff ) because they always get me everything I need . "" Only after hours and days of nagging and mental breakdowns "" I'll tell myself .

Without license and a job I'm very fully dependant on them and I don't like it cause I know my school works aren't going to be done within the deadline or whenever I want because they don't have money or they don't want to drive me anywhere . 

Just now I asked my dad for about 25 ringgit to pay for my book that my teacher's been wanting since the first day of school , and I've already given him a heads up 2 weeks ago about this and have been reminding them ever since . My dad told me that he'll give money tomorrow as usual and I didn't say anything just went up and cried my heart out . 

I need the book to study ! I'm so sure my teacher's going to hate me for delaying the payment . After crying , I told myself that I'm so done . I went down and I asked my grandma , who is here for the 2 week holidays and asked her some money in front of my parents . She gave me some 100 ringgit which I'm going to use tomorrow to buy the damn book . Although I feel like I was a bit of an asshole for doing that . Reddit , what do you think ? AITA ?"

"Basically i was getting off the train at my station and the first thing i encountred when getting out was a kid with 2 friends (one male and the other is female) getting his last ciggie out and throwing the package near my feet. So i stopped:
""Dude, pick that up. And also you arent allowed to smoke here"" and also pointed to the no smoking sign.
The kid just looked at me with a condesending look as he started to light his ciggie.
I snapped, took the ciggie out of his mouth tore it apart and threw it into the bin.

The guy started yelling and threatning me, now the thing is he is half my size (me being 6ft3, with a big build). I just told him i dont want to fight and proceeded to get out of the train station, last thing i saw was him browsing the bin. 

A minute later he and his other friend followed me running which got me to go into a fighting stance (have been training MMA for a while) pushed the first guy whom approached and warned both of them that i really know how to fight and they shouldn't mess with me. Luckily for all of us an officer that was passing by (not on duty) , warned them both that if they dont leave me he will make sure theyll get arrested  (I really didnt want to kick their asses, it wasnt a fair fight at all).

byjoad	2019-06-09 12:21:34		AITA for throwing things when angry?	"For context, I got good exam results and wanted to celebrate. I asked my bf, who was already going out with his younger sister, all her friends, plus a mutual male friend of ours. We'll call him G. He didn't outright ask me, so I asked if they minded me tagging along. He said that should be fine. 

So, G doesn't drink. He lives really close to me so generally will offer to lift me home if we are out. After the bar they all wanted to go back to one of the girl's houses. G wanted to go so I went along too. When we left it was late and he took a few of us home. 

He dropped everyone else off first, then we went on alone. Now, I was drunk. I'm a notoriously very happy friendly drunk. By this time, the sky was getting light so I suggestest we stop and go see the sun rise (it's a thing we have done in the past, no romantic connotations dw) but he didn't want to. It seemed to aggravate him. I started singing along to the music that was on and he suddenly burst out in a really angry manner, why do I ALWAYS insist on singing when I'm drunk, I'm just showing off, do I have to be so annoying etc. This dumbfounded me a bit because yeah, I like singing in the car, and if he'd have wanted me to stop because he wasn't in the mood I'd have understood, but there's definitely nicer ways to say that. It felt very personal and felt like I was suddenly in a pretty volatile environment. We were quite close to mine by this point so I told him that if I was annoying him so much to let me out. He didn't.

We arrived at mine and I tried to smooth things over with him before I left but he just started screaming at me to get out of his car, only repeating this and not allowing me to speak. It felt very aggressive and I really wasn't sure what to do. He has been known to have a temper, but I felt like if I got out it wouldn't get sorted. I began to cry and then he snapped at me to ""stop forcing tears out"" which pushed me from upset to mad. I did not appreciate being told that my emotions were false, I was genuinely upset at his screaming at me. At this point I got out, grabbed my bag and threw it out of the car into my garden, slammed his door and went into my house.

Now, issue is, it seems because I threw my handbag, G messaged my boyfriend telling him he was worried about my mental health (???) and the bf has then taken his side over the whole thing. I told him what had happened but it seems like because G was sober, and I threw my own bag into my own garden, that I'm unhinged and any of his actions were admissible. I'm really upset that my boyfriend doesn't seem to have my back. 

I'm stuck on whether throwing my bag and slamming the door was an understandable response to the car fiasco or whether it makes me the asshole. I don't like having my mental health questioned over it, my dad has BPD which they both know, and they both know I'm terrified of being like him. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byjngd	2019-06-09 12:18:17	canwritebutnotedit	AITA for not giving up my morning shift to a slow single mother of five?	"I really lucked out and was hired to work mornings M-F, occasionally covering weekends. Usually that shit’s coveted and you have to work your way up, so I feel lucky, no doubt.

However, I don’t admittedly *need* mornings M-F as much as some- I’m childless, so I could really work whenever. 

It does greatly benefit my health, though. I have maintenance insomnia (early morning waking), and am just a early bird in general. 

Back when I did work evenings, I’d be grateful to sleep in until 5am, getting maybe 5 hours of sleep. Usually, I would wake more at 2 or 3am and be a zombie all day. 

Anyway, my bosses hired a new woman. She is a single mother of five, so she really needs mornings M-F, because that’s when her mom can watch her kids. She didn’t directly ask me to give up my shift, but strongly hinted at it repeatedly.

Usually, I would be like “sorry, find a new job,” but you can tell she’s on the slow side. My mother was also like that, too slow to find decent work (couldn’t learn much more than how to wipe tables), but not slow enough for disability. This woman doesn’t seem quite as slow, she can work a cash register, but I still know it must be difficult for her to find and keep work.

That said, I don’t know if she would be... responsible enough to open. I’m probably drawing way too many comparisons between my mother and her- but opening you’re by yourself a few hours until managers come in. If shit hits the fan before then, you have to be able to handle it yourself. I don’t know if she’d be able to, I know my mom wouldn’t have been.

I don’t know. I think I might just feel worse than I should from knowing my mother and her struggle. She was also single, just with me, but still. Coupled with mild mental disability... shit must suck for this woman like it did my mom. 

But in knowing that, if I was a truly good hearted person, I’d offer it up and let managers decide if she could handle it.

AITA?

Edit: I didn’t explain very well my worries of how she might not be able to handle opening. It’s more the potential stress level, not her mental ability. “Responsible” was a poor word choice- I couldn’t really think of a good way to phrase it while keeping text short.

I worry if certain things would be too stressful for her with opening, like I opened once with alarms malfunctioning and blaring. Couldn’t get ahold of any managers, a cop showed up, and I had to figure out how to reset the alarms myself. It was stressful, hard to maintain a cool head. 

Handling a normal check out by herself for the first time, she panicked when she hit a wrong button. I helped her out and she was fine, but if she was alone, I don’t know if she would have panicked further. 

I hope that explains my worries some. I’m really not trying to sound mean about it. But, yes, I accept I am drawing too many comparisons between my mom’s abilities and hers. I was very protective of my mother, I would never have put her in a situation as stressful as the alarm thing by herself- I would have been there immediately to help her out. But she is not my mom. She might have handled it fine, I don’t know.

I think I’ll ask managers first if they’d mind her covering a couple morning shifts for me. If they say that’s fine, I’ll train with her a couple, but also share with her some of the things I’ve had to deal with. She has a right to know that it can be stressful and decide herself if she wants that.

If I give her two M-F shifts, it would actually work out well. We need people to work weekends, I cover when we’re desperate, but don’t really like working 6-7 days a week. I could open weekends, still get two days off. She doesn’t want full time anyway, could do two days opening, the one or two mid-shifts (12pm-4pm.) It seems like a good compromise. If it ends up too stressful for her, we’ll go back to normal.

byjjph	2019-06-09 12:03:59	schwimm3	AITA for leaving after she told me she had a smoke again?	"Beforehand: sorry for maybe wrong chosen words, not my first language.

So, basically we both stopped smoking when we got together as a couple. Not that any of us forced the other towards it, more like we were about to spend that money otherwise and wanted to live healthier. That was two years ago.

Before her I was in a relationship with some lady that lied to me (unnecessarily because I would have understood) everyday about not smoking, despise the fact that she smelled like a god damn ashtray whenever she came back home. Was pretty obvious, no big deal now but since then I really apreciate honesty A LOT. Even more on that topic somehow. My new GF knows about that very well as I asked her to tell me, if she'd come back to it, just don't lie to me about it. There's no reason to lie, it's not that a big deal.

Yesterday evening (10pm) she told me out of the blue that when she was meeting her best friend and her bf maybe three month ago she discovered that guy has an IQOS smoke device (or however you call it) and wanted to test it out, so she did. OFC she was drunk that time.

I just asked if she's being serious, waited a little if she says anything more than 'are you actually upset about that' and then I left her place. The fact that she aint able to hold on to what she promises while she's drunk and even worse the fact that she did not even tell me afterwards really pisses me off. To me it's like 'oh yeah I was pretty badly addicted to that shit, 'clean' for almost two years now, OH LOOK AT THAT SHINY THING gotta test it out, whooops not gonna tell my bf he'll never find out, fuck being honest'.

No, I am not a scary dude who makes his GF live in fear, nor am I emotionally abusing her or whatever, just before that comes up as a reason she could have not been telling me.

&#x200B;

Right now, 2pm next day, haven't texted her yet cuz I'm really pissed. She didn't either tho.

I really wonder if I am just the asshole for being pissed, even tho this might seem like a small issue to others.

Unfortunately there was a major accident and with traffic it took us five and a half hours to get home so I had her drop me at home and said I’d pick up my car Sunday before my shift or ask my SO to drive me in 

Yesterday we spent the day in Toronto with a friend and saw an evening musical. We booked the tickets before I got pregnant and being 23 weeks I knew it was going to be a long day. Overall it was great, but by the time we got out of the city is was nearly midnight. I was too tired to retrieve my car safely so I asked my SO if he’d drive me to work and I could get my car after I even offered gas money.  He commented that he had plans to see people along the lines of “doing something fun” and the exhaustion, need to use the washroom and hunger made me kind of snap and I said “not everything is about fun” to which he said “which is why I need it now before he gets here”.

He values his friends and social life and I get that, they are my friends too. But I worry his priority lies there with the thought that our son will be the end to all that. Babies are a lot of hard work and he hasn’t read the books, joined the sub Reddit’s I suggest, said we don’t need to take a class and I did the registry on my own. 

He jokes we can just “wing it”, but he will spend hours preparing an RPG campaign but not prepping for this, which makes me think I’m more invested and kind of alone sometimes in this. 

It was a long day that came to a head and I basically shut down after the comment. We had a guest so I didn’t want to start anything. I went home straight to bed and now I’m cabbing to my car as not to bother him.

My GF's best friend (Bestie) is visiting the country for a few days, so we had planned a party at my parents' place last night for Bestie's 30th.

&#x200B;

I invited a bunch of my friends as she doesn't know anyone else here, got booze, snacks, balloons and funny hats as GF wanted it to be special. Only stipulation I had is that we wind down early as I have an early start and long day at work today.

&#x200B;

The party is good, some annoying people but mostly chill and I'm sober. Things got a bit weird when Bestie (wasted) started getting pretty ""friendly"" with a couple of guys there (A and B). 

&#x200B;

11pm I want to wind down and get rest.

&#x200B;

In the meantime, A (Barely know him, we have a mutual friend) got totally plastered, unable to stand, started spitting in the pool and long story short, it got pretty ugly with him pissing everywhere and stripping naked before we threw him into a cab. I was livid and told everyone else to leave as well, which they did after helping me clean up.

&#x200B;

11:30pm it was only me, GF, Bestie (all staying the night) and B remaining. B is a long-time friend of mine who was obviously trying hard to score with her. I told B he has to go, and asked the girls to get changed and go to bed while I cleared up,but GF and Bestie are yelling at us to stay and get in the hot tub.

&#x200B;

Instead of leaving, B decides to ask them to go out clubbing. I told him he's not taking them out as they're too wasted and he needs to leave, to which he responded ""give me 10 minutes to say bye"". I told him no, and to get out, to which he said OK. I went upstairs to shower and get into bed, leaving them all outside.

&#x200B;

After a few minutes, I hear noises and checked the cameras (on my iPad) to see if they're getting into bed. Instead of coming in, I see all 3 of them walking out the house to get into B's car outside the view of the camera. I went downstairs to lock up the place thinking if they really wanted to go out, that's their choice and B would look after the girls, although I was furious.

&#x200B;

00:00 I get a call from a Close Friend. saying that B called saying that he was gonna come by and drop the girls off there. Close Friend asks me what I want him to do, I told him to let the girls stay there and sleep it off so I don't need to worry about them. I found out later that GF and Bestie crashed on his bed while he took the couch, kicking B out of his place.

&#x200B;

This morning, I found out that GF had tried to get back into the house last night to get her keys, but as I had locked the doors, she had asked to be dropped off with my Close Friend.

&#x200B;

I feel that my GF didn't back me up/trust me and help me get everyone out when I said the party's over, and was immature about the whole thing. She said she's sorry and regrets acting like an idiot, but I still feel betrayed.

Twenty minutes after my pickup time, the pizzas are out of the oven and he's off the phone. He hands me the pizza and starts to explain what happened, but I interrupt and say ""I do want to hear the whole story, but please call me. Right now I have a lot of people waiting on me. Thank you!""

I walk out the door. He chases me outside and says ""You need to pay!"" I say ""I paid online! Please figure out what's happening and then call me."" I get in my car and drive off. I said three whole sentences the entire time I was in the store, counting that one, and I was perfectly calm (albeit a little annoyed) the whole time.

&#x200B;

From my perspective, this story was ""I had to wait 20 minutes for pizza."" It was annoying, but not exactly life-changing.

Well, when I talked to the manager later, he said this was the most traumatic experience he's had in 20 years working there. He was shaking afterward. He's a human being who doesn't deserve to be abused like that. He tried to help me out, but then I ***stole*** the food. He should have called the police (but decided it wasn't worth it). No other customer has ever just taken food and walked out the door like that before.

I'm absolutely certain no objective observer would have characterized my behavior as even a little bit abusive. But AITA for leaving without taking the time to resolve the payment issue?

byjeqx	2019-06-09 11:44:23	misskamary	AITA for now wanting my parents to read my purchase history on my bank account?	"EDIT: Not wanting, sorry. Spelling error in the title  
I am currently a 25 year old woman with a full time job and a student loan that's been half way paid off. I work a little above minimum wage and have a comfortable place where rent is easily within what I can afford. However, I did have an issue with spending before. I had a friend who I was far too generous with bailing out of situations. I struggled because I was supporting any extra person and when my parents found this out, they invited me to move back home.

However, they worry about my spending now as a result. They keep a close eye on my bank account. When I went away for school, we set up my bank account so that my dad had access to it so if I was ever in an emergency situation, he could bail me out. And he's helped me a lot, including with my student loan. Honestly, it was really nice of him to do that much, however, there are issues.

Because he gets copies of my bank statements, he will send me texts or emails about how much I've been spending at specific place and request to know what I bought there. One time he misread my payment on my loan as being to EB Games (they were next to each other on the list) and demanding to know why I spent so much on video games. After that, I told him that it makes me really uncomfortable that he looks through my purchase history and requested he either stop or I set up a new account and only keep this one for my loan. This upset him and he said that I was being ungrateful and that my words had hurt him.

I know my dad is trying is best, but it makes me extremely uncomfortable because I worry over how to explain any purchase over $50 not for rent or utilities to him. I know he's just trying to protect me after what happened with my ex-roommate, but it really stress me out.

Am I the asshole for feeling like my past situation doesn't justify him watching my purchases and wanting him to stop?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	75.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

So from mid-January to mid-May, I subleased an apartment from a listing I found on Facebook. I’m a student and only needed it for the Spring semester. When I moved in, the person I subleased from (not the landlord) charged me half the month’s rent and utilities since I wasn’t there the whole month. Because I moved out mid-May, I assumed I would be charged similarly to January, and the person I sublease from did not tell me any differently. I told her  in early April that I was moving out of the apartment on May 10, and she thanked me for letting her know. 

But, about a week ago, the subleaser texted me and said I need to pay for the entire month of May despite not living there the entire month. Her reasoning is that she couldn’t sublet the apartment for the few weeks I was not living there. I am fully prepared to pay for half the month, since I was there until May 9, but I don’t think it’s fair for her to text me out of the blue and ask for the whole month’s rent.

"I went on a trip to see my friend, we decided to go clubbing because we had never seen the nightlife here. We found this club but we were deciding whether or not to go in because I didn't have the cash on me for the entry fee so I would have to go get money out and it just seemed more of a hassle.  Plus you know if the place was bad then that sucks. The security guard heard us talking (we were right in front of him, cause we asked him the entry fee price)  and said to us ""Hey it's ladies night (it wasn't) I can either let you in for free or you pay $10 and get unlimited drinks (you usually pay $20 for unlimited) we said we would want free entry. He said ""sure go on up and tell the girls"" 

We told the girls at the desk and said stuff like ""oh no he can't do that"" ""you're not getting in for free"" and so on. It's their job so we just said ""okay thank you"" and started to leave. The guard saw us and asked us why and we just told them he then said ""fuck that"" went and grabbed the stamper and stamped us both and told us to go in.

&#x200B;

Anyway so I told my friend about this and she says  I should of refused because he may get in trouble, but I don't really get how it would be my fault when he was the one that offered the deal to us, we never begged him for free entry, we didn't flirt with him or whatever.

byj8w7	2019-06-09 11:20:31	LumberjackedLesbian	AITA for not telling my friend her apartment smells?	"So, this actually happened a few years ago, almost immediately after it happened the friend in question fell very ill, so, I never gave a lot of thought to bringing this up because it just wasn't important by comparison. Now, though, she's been healthy for a while and I'm going to visit again soon, so I feel like I need to think about how to handle this before I get there, which feels like it'd be helped along by knowing how poorly I handled it to begin with.

I started talking to this friend online when I was 16 and when I was 20 we finally had the chance to meet up, I booked a flight to go see her and was planning to stay there (it didn't feel risky at all, we'd skyped so often I'd even 'met' most of her family, at that point). Everything was pretty much fine up until I got dropped off outside her apartment building. 

We were genuinely excited to see each other but when we hugged I noticed she kind of smelled a bit, honestly, didn't think much of it. Then, we go up to her apartment and honestly? It absolutely reeked. As soon as she opened the door it was like being hit with a wall of smell, I've genuinely never smelt anything so bad, I wasn't sure I'd be able to stay there.

I probably would've said something, but I already knew she had a couple small dogs that she kept pee pads out for while she was at work. I figured between the closed windows (safety, the neighbourhood isn't great), old, tiny apartment, and the pets pooping and peeing on the pads for hours, maybe it'd get better once she aired it out. That sucks, but it seems fair enough, not a lot to be done about it. 

The smell never went away. Ever. It was so bad I couldn't even sleep, and the visit ended up being a bit disappointing because I was extremely reluctant to go out and do things when I knew all of my clothes (and probably my hair) would smell awful. I even felt guilty on the plane home, subjecting people to how I must've smelled. I honestly should have said something that first visit, I let myself get too bogged down in anxiety and not wanting to hurt her feelings or ruin our time together that I probably did exactly that by ending up withdrawn. 

The thing is, I feel kind of torn. I know going 'nose-blind' is a thing (my mom, a hoarder, has definitely reached that point), and if she wasn't aware it seemed cruel to tell her something that she might not even believe and would probably upset her. On the other hand, I can't be the only one who notices this about her. She seems unaware, but surely people around her or people she has over have also noticed the smell?

byj81k	2019-06-09 11:16:56		AITA for calling my friend a fucking idiot	"Will keep it as short as possible

I met my high school best friend after 4 years. We were chatting and then I remembered that she used to date my old neighbour. I asked her what happened to that relationship. She started crying and said that it was all her fault. So she explained the whole conversation. Let's call my friend Sam and the boyfriend Toby. 

Toby: Sam, I'm sorry but I cheated on you. I know you won't forgive me I'm really sorry. Let's just end this relationship here. 

Sam: What? No, it's completely okay. I understand that you have some needs and I may not satisfy them so it's okay to find pleasure somewhere. Please don't leave me. 

Toby: No, what I did was wrong and I feel terrible. I'm sorry let's just end this here. It's for our own good. 

Sam: No, it's okay. Please don't leave me. I love you. It's my fault, ......

As soon as she told me this I couldn't help myself and I said, ""Dude, how can you be such a fucking idiot?"". She was really shook by my what I said and left crying. I was really pissed and I didn't apologise at that moment. Later I felt bad and apologised and told her why I said what I said. 

So, AITA? 


Also, if you're interested, I asked Toby why he cheated on her.  What really happened is Toby noticed that Sam was really obsessed with and would get really sad and start crying/apologising at any minor disagreement. He saw that as a red flag and he knew that if they were ever to break up it would be really ugly for Sam. Toby had also told Sam that he does not believe in long distance relationships and if they went to different colleges he couldn't continue the relationship. And when Toby got into a Canadian university (we live in India). He had to think of a way to break up pleasantly. So he decided that he'd tell her that he cheated on her and she'd obviously see it as his fault and would not try to bring him back. But that obviously backfired as seen above. So he just apologised and blocked her. (You might doubt that he made this up but I have confirmed from a lot of people)."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

If you’ve seen the documentary “kids for cash” than just know it’s somewhere around that area. So six years ago we had this student that I’ll call John. This boy was to be completely honest one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. I wholeheartedly believe if he had chosen a different path in life he would have been valedictorian. But John just loved doing bad shit. Smoking in the bathroom, showing up to school baked, calling teachers ungodly names, fist fighting, you name he probably did it. 

But honestly John wasn’t a bad kid. His family was judged extremely harshly, all of them felons, each parent in and out of jail. So he was treated like white trash by students and teachers alike. It’s understandable why he would act the way he would.

So it was half way through Johns tenth grade year when the superintendents son told John that he had been “fucking his crackwhore mom all night long”. John was 5’ 10” and 140 pounds soaking wet at 16 years old. Despite that I have genuinely never seen a worse beat down in my life. It took less than an hour for me to get a call from the super telling me to get rid of him.

I went along with it at the time not paying much thought to it. John was sent to the neighborhood reform school and from there to juvenile detention. Somewhere along the way he graduated high school early and joined the army. He’s still a very active part of the community while on leave and I actually introduced him to a school assembly where he spoke of how he turned his life around. I thought at the time that my part in his life had been what had straightened him up. I noticed he was short with me before and after his speech but thought nothing of it, figuring he was a man of few words.

Yesterday I saw him eating lunch with an old teacher of his that I remember him being particularly close to. I went up to them asking if I could join and then John pulled me aside.

He gave me a speech about how I was a key piece in what was ultimately some pretty messed up experiences in his life. I don’t remember too much of it except the words “The way you guys did me may have been standard, but it wasn’t right. So sincerely Jake (my first name which I thought was incredibly rude), go fuck yourself”.

I’m using this throwaway account because my roommate knows I use reddit and follows this subreddit and she has no idea of this aspect of my life and I prefer it stays this way. 
I’m 20 and just finished second year of university. My uni is 10 hours drive from home so I only go home in holidays and summer.  
Growing up, I was always a good kid, straight A’s.  I managed to attend a good high school and after that good university. Also I’m doing well at classes right know. Almost 3.5 GPA. 
Whole my life my dad has always been pressured us (me and my little brother) to get good grades. It still sounds normal but whenever we get into disagreement or argument he’d hit us, beat us from a very young age. I have memories it’s happenning when I was 4-5. 
Last time he hit me I was 17.  I was furious, threatened him that I will report abusive to police and his career in education will be over. Ironically he is a very good teacher, people adore him. I was always jelaous of other students when I was younger because he seemed like he always wanted best for his students not for me and my brother. Anyways, when I was 17 I told him that I was done with him and as soon as I have the chance that I would cut him out of my life completely. After that he apologized and it still took time to have a normal relationship with him but I’d say we are fine.
Today as I’m writing this we are in the car. Going for a vacation to some hotel. In the car we got into an argument. I told him that I always envy my friends’ dads because they make time to spend some time with their children. My dad doesn’t. He spends all his time with his friends at the club. Mom and brother agrees with me. Actually my mom told him that he should spend more time with us this summer after that I followed.
During this argument he tries to change the subject to mom smoking cigarettes or my brother sleeping till evening. I told him that he has no one to blame but himself and if he is the man he thinks he should admit his mistakes and work on them before it is too late because I’m 20, my brother is 16. I think I will never be able to forgive his previous mistakes but I think with my brother has a chance.
Instead of being sorry or accepting his mistakes he yelled at me. I wanted to get out of the car and get a taxi to go back home. He gave me an ultimatum if he lets me go there will be no father and daughter relationship between us. I accepted. Mom didn’t let me get out and I’m still stuck with him for 3 hours more.
So here is my question, after the vacation WIBTA if I stop talking to him? 
And if I do that when I get back to college I will have to get a job because my dad supports me financally. I have a schoolarship but it is not enough. My mom doesn’t make any money.

He’s one of the best people, and I love ‘em. If he needed me to drive 1000 miles to get him, I’d do it. We would talk about growing and how we’d be each other’s kids’ uncle’s. I fucking love this guy, and he means so much to me. But recently he’s been different. 

Ya see he achieves a lot. And I would be proud of him if it weren’t for how he reacts I guess. He’s received 7 student of the month awards this year, and while he doesn’t flaunt them, the one time I got one he said: “well I’ve got like 6 so they don’t matter.” Whether or not he meant the negative connotation to that, I really don’t know, but it made me feel really irrelevant. There was also a night to honor students who did exceptionally well in highschool. He texts me and asks where I was and I explain I wasn’t invited, and I couldn’t talk to him cuz I was teaching this violin lesson. [now my highschool carreer has kinda sucked. I got dealt bad cards, and I’m ok with that, and I made the best of them, and I’m happy with what I did. He knows this and he knows I didn’t get the best grades because of things like family deaths and mental health] he texts me and tells me: “well you would be here if you did ur fucking homework 😂.” Now I really don’t cry - being a teenage boy and all - but that hit me really hard. I stayed up countless nights helping him with his problems and sometimes his homework, once I wrote an essay for him. And to hear that from him really made me feel like shit. 

He’s constantly dating someone. The last 6 months has been hell because he put me on second hand, and he ignored my texts, and never wanted to hang out. Being like my only friend, I started to feel increasingly lonely. So one day I confronted him. I told him how I felt he didn’t care about our friendship and how I really care about him and want to hang out and actually be his friend, but he just shrugged it off and said: “sorry I’m busy, hope you’re not mad😂”

Finally, last week he broke up with his girlfriend. I was excited because she was kinda controlling and I could finally spend some quality time with my friend - by the way he’s shipping off for the navy in 6 weeks. Anyways, this week I asked a girl out. I really have been lacking in relationships since and I kinda wanted to not be alone anymore. I ended up getting ghosted and while I didn’t feel too bad, my friend walks up to a chick and asks for her number and managed to get a date instantly. Now I’m fucking proud, but he wouldn’t stop flaunting how easy it was. And like how he feels great. He knew I just got ghosted by my crush and he knows how I feel, but he just kinda... idk. 

Tonight was the senior overnighter. The entire time he spent with this random chick and completely ignored me. I felt a tear in my chest. I wanted to go home and just lay in bed. He didn’t really care to me. I don’t want to be his friend anymore. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	398.0	146.0	0.0	0.0

I waited for them for 4 hours in 90F summer, humid weather. I barely browsed any of the stores because I was waiting for them in a cafe.

I called them and they told me they were at a friends house. They told me they were on their way now. 1 hour later no response. Mind you this is a 15 minute drive and where we live there is NO traffic. I called them again. They said they were coming to pick me up, not going to shop with me.

I got fucking pissed off and sent a bunch of messages asking them why they didn’t tell me they weren’t going to shop with me and having making me wait for 4 hours for them when I could have just rode the bus home or shopped by myself. Still no response!!! So I told them that I wasn’t there anymore and rode the bus home, ignoring all of their bombarding messages and calls on the way back.

Apparently they were still looking for me when I very clearly told them I wasn’t there anymore. Now they’re mad at me for not responding to my messages when they did the exact same thing to me. 

I waited for them 4 hours OUTDOORS. They looked for me for 20 minutes indoors.

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, I'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. I assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked Jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if I knew the reason they broke up. I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life.

So, a while ago, I was walking down the street with my friend. We noticed that, coming the other direction, was a professional looking woman in her late 40s/early 50s. We also noticed that she was engrossed in her phone and not, at any point, looking up to check her surroundings. We were fated to be on a collision course if we both kept going in a straight line.

As a matter of principle, I decided to hold my course. I was staring at her intently for about 10-12 seconds (whilst continuing to walk forward), waiting for her to look up and notice that we were there. I would have been happy to move a little if she had seen us but I chose not to. 

Inevitably, we collided. Only a brush of shoulders but it was enough to dislodge her phone from her hand. I didn't stick around to assess the damage but the sound of phone hitting floor and the mutterings of sadness I could hear from her were enough to assume the phone had some damage.

I could have easily taken a step to my left (she would have then cut through me and my friend) as it was a wide path but I didnt think I should have to move for someone who can't look where they're going.

byivm3	2019-06-09 10:24:11	Qyro	AITA for taking my wife's phone from her every night?	"My wife has had some serious missteps with money. We have a shared account where all the major things come out, but also have our own personal accounts too. I never dip into the shared account for anything, but often I have to use my personal finance to keep the shared account afloat. She has a number of medical issues she struggles with on a daily basis. To keep it relevant she suffers from fairly severe anxiety. This has led her down into debt and gambling, and dragged me down with her. I do my best to support her emotionally and financially, but at some point enough has to be enough and the line has to be drawn.

&#x200B;

She had a fairly routine surgery on Tuesday just gone. Her anxiety amplified her stress and she started down the spiral of debt and gambling again last week. We woke up one morning to find £100 of my money from my account had been spent on gambling websites. Apparently she had gotten up in the middle of the night and, off her face on medication, decided to do some late night gambling, forgetting it uses real money, and for some reason had my bank account details. She also had a couple of emails saying she had won £100, so I figured no harm no foul. However as the surgery got closer, I noticed more of my money disappearing from my account in £10 increments. All told that's another £150 gone from my account, leaving me with practically nothing.

&#x200B;

In reaction to these episodes she took all my banking details off all her devices and put a 5-year block on all the gambling websites she could think of. Nonetheless she suggested I take her phone from her at night just as a safety measure, and I agreed. The surgery came and went and the procedure went smoothly. She wants her phone back at night because her anxiety tends to flair up and it's her way of coping. She'll sit up in bed until the early hours playing low-effort games to calm her mind and send her to sleep. But I decided to keep her phone a little longer.

&#x200B;

It didn't help that a couple of days ago she went pay a bill manually and accidentally put the decimal in the wrong place, paying ten times the amount we needed to, and practically cleaning out our shared account. I had to put the £150 she had paid me back from her gambling back into the shared account just to cover food and bills this week, putting me back at empty once again. I trust her in many ways, but I'm not going to lie, my trust in her capability and responsibility with money is waning. As such last night I asked for her phone again and she got really defensive about it. She reasoned that there is no way she can gamble our money away again, that she's not nearly as stressed out as she was last week, and that she needs her phone to calm her down and send her to sleep. I said no and insisted she give me her phone to look after. Nonetheless, I do feel kind of bad about it, however necessary I feel it is at the same time. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	3386.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

byitfb	2019-06-09 10:15:30	ff0000yPlayerOne	AITA for telling my Mom to mind her own business about my spouse?	"For context, me/my spouse and my side of the family live 3K miles away. 

1. My spouse did not travel 3K miles to attend a 3-hr baby shower on a Sunday for my sister. I was deployed at the time, and in the process of moving back home with her family she forgot to RSVP. When she responded, my Mom told her she “would be lying if she wasn’t disappointed.” She’s still not over it.

2. While deployed, I encouraged my spouse to have fun and not worry about me. My wife has her own career. What she wants to do with her money and her weekend is up to her. My Mom felt her posting pictures on social media with her friends was incredibly disrespectful to me and my service while deployed (it’s not), stopped talking to her because of it while I was gone, and still isn’t over it.

3. I didn’t have a functional phone immediately upon returning from a deployment so I asked my wife to send a text to my family saying I arrived safely and would talk to them the following day so I could spend the evening alone with my spouse. My Mom sent my wife a text back saying “congratulations…you won. It’s not all about you”. I suppose my Mom thought it was a malicious attempt on behalf of my wife to keep me from contacting them (?). If anything, that’s on me I’m not sure why my Mom directed her anger at my spouse.

4. My wife is a germaphobe. It’s not easy, but she meets me halfway on this. My Mom believes this is a personality deficit I guess vs. an actual disorder and took offense at the answer when she asked my wife why she wasn’t eating a cookie from a communal tray in our own home while they were visiting.

5. My mom accused my spouse of being jealous of my sister for not liking/commenting on the FB posts of her child enough, believes she’s waging a war to keep me from seeing my family, and accuses me of doing nice things for my wife just so she doesn’t leave me (...incredibly offensive). Additionally, my mom has thinks my spouse had nothing before she met me, has everything now, and is ungrateful for it.

6. For reasons including but not limited to the above, my wife probably won’t join us on a family vacations this year. I don’t necessarily agree with her decision, but I understand why she feels that way and the bottom line is she’s an adult who can make her own vacation decisions. My Mom told me that I needed to do something about it. I don’t plan to. 

Bottom line is I told my Mom that my relationship with my spouse is none of her business, to keep her unsolicited advice to herself, and to stop saying negative things directly to my spouse.

I know deep down my Mom just wants the best for me, but she bottles up her emotions and creates fantasy scenarios end up exploding in an unhealthy way. It’s having a toxic effect on our family. At the end of the day I’m 100% content in my marriage. So I told her to stay out of it. Haven’t talked to her since (~ a week). AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
byit4t	2019-06-09 10:14:09	Loaded_Diced	AITA for refusing to pay my gf rent and financially cutting her off.	Where to start...this a post out of frustration but seeing as I could possibly be messing up my gf relationship with her parents, I've decided to come to you all. Basically my gf lives in the south and studies at my university in a northern city. Due to the distance from her house, more often than not, she is required to stay on campus for summer classes and research opportunities. Her parents have agreed to pay half of her $800  rent while she stays up north. A few months ago she had quit her job, so until she got on her feet, I agreed to cover the rent without any asking of being paid back. Ok...well recently I found out that she stopped attending class because she didn't do well on her first exam and hasn't been going for the last few weeks. In addition to this, some weekends I ask to come over and hang out with her, she says she cannot because she will be partying or having friends over. Originally i had no issue with this because i wanted her to be able to have fun and relax while she was away from home. But theoretically in paying part of her rent for her to party, lounge around and hang out with friends and not go to class. Her parents do not know I've been paying the other half of her rent, as they believe she still has her job. I've been thinking about just cancelling my card for her rent due to this, but I couldnt separate whether I was upset that she wasn't hanging out with me, or was I putting her foot down for not taking school seriously on someone else's dime.

I went to the kiosk and let the bloke know the pump wasn’t working and would it be okay to change to another pump, to which he said yeah, no problem. I filled up £25.00 diesel without issue on the other pump. When I went to pay, however the man presented the card machine with £28.50. I just laughed and politely said that I was only gonna pay the £25.00 as I didn’t believe I had got any kind of fuel out of the first pump. He proceeded to get very angry at me saying I was a thief ect. It didn’t really help that he couldn’t speak English so I was struggling to convey that I felt I was being ripped off and that the pump should have been made out of order. I gave him £25.

byio2w	2019-06-09 09:51:09	Throw_away_740	AITA for getting back at my sister?	"I’m using a throwaway because my sister knows my reddit account. 
     Quick bit of context: So I am 16F and my sister is 18F. For about a year now she has been teasing me about my underwear choice (sounds really childish, ik). She thinks that since I’m in high school I should be wearing more flattering types of underwear I guess but I like to wear simple briefs or bikini style. She and some of her friends she got to play along always make off-putting remarks about me wearing “granny panties” and trying to low-key embarrass me in front of my friends or boyfriend. At home, my sister has joked and given me a wedgie a couple times. 
     Well earlier this week, I walked into the kitchen as she and her friend were in there. They tried to make some joke about me and my sister mentioned how she gave me one not too long ago. When I made a snarky comment back she and her friend ganged up on me and sorta pinned me against the refrigerator and my sister pulled on my underwear and she ended up ripping them. She normally never takes anything this far and it actually hurt when she did it. She saw I was visibly getting frustrated as I’ve told her to stop doing stuff like that multiple times. Later that day when I tried to tell her how I felt and attempted to get her to stop, she essentially told me what she has told me the past couple times I brought it up; that it’s just a joke and she has done it before with her friends without problem so I might as well just play along with it. So I did exactly that. 
    The next day when we were in the living room, I ended up pulling her thong up and it tore apart a little bit. She got really angry with me and cursed me out calling me a jerk for it. When I told her how she has told me multiple times to just play along with it after I told her multiple times to stop, she promised she and her friends were going to get me back 10x worse and that I’ll deserve it. 
    So I’m wondering if I’m really the asshole here? I mean, she kept doing it to me and told me to play along with her little wedgie game. I’m legitimately nervous of what she might try to do back to me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byings	2019-06-09 09:48:20		WIBTA If I stopped making an effort with my friends?	"So, I've got two friends, we'll call them James and Bob.

I haven't really felt close to them for almost a year now. We're all early 20's.

I feel like I should stop putting effort into the friendships, for different reasons for each of them. 

James got a girlfriend a while ago, that's not bad, but frankly I don't like her and I don't/didn't think their relationship was healthy. (They've just broken up, kind of, it's complicated.) 

We haven't talked in a while, and last time we did, he got really drunk and cheated on his girlfriend. I may not like her, but nobody deserves that. He defend it by saying that she's probably cheating on him as well tonight. So, I don't think I want to be friends with him any more, I don't like the person he's become. 

Bob is a different kettle of fish. 

He's arrogant, opinionated and extremely competitive. I was alright with that for a while, I put it down to high school mentality. 

But he's still being so competitive, and I've talked to him about it, and he says that's the way he is, but I don't need him calling me up to compare how much we both earned at our jobs, and being called an bastard for out-earning him with fewer hours. Even if it is a joke, I don't want that. 

What tipped it over for me was splitting the alcohol. We were going to a party, and he offered to split alcohol cost with me. I told him to speak to my brother about it, since he was shouting me until I got paid. I spoke with my brother, and they'd talked about it, but hadn't ironed out the details and Bob had stopped responding to texts. So we got our own alcohol, and at the party Bob offered us shots of alcohol he had brought. (Fairly expensive stuff, he was trying to impress someone.)

I thought it was all fine until he told us we owed him $22 for splitting the alcohol he'd brought. That was half the cost, and while we did drink what was offered to us, it was nowhere near half. 

The way I look at it is this:

* He stopped responding before ironing out the details. 
* Didn't call to ask what we wanted, just brought something we would've never have gotten ourselves. 
* I feel like he did that on purpose. 


Sorry for the rant guys, but I feel done with those people, would I be an asshole for just letting those relationships go, rather than saying anything?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byin7m	2019-06-09 09:47:07	Nervesofsteel77	AITA for refusing to do the dishes when they would have just been cleaned again anyway?	"I want to preface this by saying this happened a while back while I still lived with my grandparents. My grandfather always had a strict way that everything had to be done, if it was done any other way it wasn't done correct, and that went for anything you can think of. My grandparents decided to give me chores for the time (which was understandable.) which mostly consisted of making the beds and doing the dishes.

&#x200B;

The problem with doing the dishes was every single time I did them, within an hour my grandfather had taken them all out of the strainer and had started washing them again, this went on for the better part of four years, it annoyed me but I never bothered to say anything. He always said it was because I didn't wash them correctly, while grandma would take his side, but my parents would always compliment me on how well I had done on them.

&#x200B;

Fast forward about another year I got sick of doing the dishes just to have them get done again, so when my grandparents told me to do them I simply told them no, my reasoning being because I did them yesterday, to which both of my grandparents said I was being rude by not doing the dishes, my parents took my side, noting that even if I had done them, grandpa would have just washed them again, they got into an argument for a bit and everyone went to bed mad at each other, my parents still think I was in the right, and my grandparents still think I was being rude.

"Wife and I are not on good terms, in fact, she was sleeping in the other bedroom when this happened. Our dog has been sick and she (dog) didn't wake either of us up before she let loose some stools in the master bedroom while I was asleep at 3AM. I woke up as it was happening. Got the dog outside. Got dressed. Went to the other side of the house and woke my wife up and told her I needed her help. We both cleaned it up. Equal parts helping, equal parts gagging (it was really bad). Though she was the one that ended up scooping it but it wasn't because I wasn't willing to, it just worked out that way. I was still getting supplies out and she started scooping it up before we even had a bag to put it in. Got done, I did a finish mopping after we both sanitized the floor while she went and checked on the dog and cleaned her backside up. 

Now she's upset because I didn't tell her thanks for her help. Of course, she never told me thanks either. I guess she just expects me to tell her thanks because I came and woke her up to help??

Me and this friend group go way back (8+ years) since fourth grade, and I dont think ill ever find a group I can click so well with. However, recently, everyone's been having a HUGE attitude and ego, i mean shit like they wont message first because its ""weakness"" and always replying with dry ass replies because thats how you show dominance (basically Harvey Specter's shit attitude on crack). Even my closest friend (we'll call him James) was becoming one of the worst. I would always be the instigator, messaging first, always keeping contact and treating everyone equally, but it became such a fucking chore to do so.

Soon enough I stop talking to everyone, I got caught up with exams, had a lot of uni application stuff and work to take care of (this was 1 year ago). We also barely met due to different subjects and timetables at school. I later got some advice saying its not worth it to hold grudges, and i tried to rekindle the friendship (usually being the instigator).

We have these end of year exams which decide which unis we go to (based on conditional offers) and then after that 2 months of summer, then its goodbye basically forever. We get a 3 week spring break 3 months before these exams, my parents were leaving the country and I had the house to myself. I try my best to get us all to do as much shit as possible (its our last year together), especially since the year before that James' parents also left for 3 weeks, and they all did so much shit every day and had a crazy good holiday, while I was stuck abroad in my home country (i saw their snaps and talked to them and shit). I tried recreating that, but we ended up going out just one time, where I had to basically drag their ass for that. And before you say ""what if they were busy"" they werent. I could see on snap and shit how they were going and they were free the whole time.

After this, i was fucking fuming. I came to the conclusion everyone should go fuck themselves. I ceased ALL contact and focused on my exams. After 2 weeks, james finally messages me, and i keep replying with dry 1 word replies or seenzoning, returning the shit treatment he gave me. I've decided that even after the exams im no longer rolling over for anyone, and here I am now. I spoke to another outside friend and he says that it's not worth it, that i should just enjoy the last 2 months i have with them, since we've been friends for such a long time, but i think that this shit is getting ridiculous. Even so, i have no idea what im going to do alone for 2 months in my final summer here. Im torn between feeling like an asshole for throwing away the long friendship we have over something trivial, and having some self respect to where they should fuck themselves.

For almost a year now, he's been doing some work on his flat, his girlfriend told me he bought the place and he's knocking down walls and stuff. Fair enough, as long as he's considerate we're all good.

It was alright at the start, I would see him bringing his tools up from his van in the morning as I was leaving for class and by the time I came back in the evening he was done for the day. But recently he's started finishing later, so when I get home around 6pm I can still hear him doing whatever it is downstairs which is annoying as hell, but some evenings I have work so then it's always quiet when I come home after that.

About 5-6 weeks ago, he started doing it on the weekends. Saturday and Sunday afternoon, that's fair enough. Late Saturday mornings, annoying but I'm up anyways so I just blast music from my speakers. It started to annoy me when he decided he wanted to start at 8am on a Sunday morning. That was about 3 weeks ago and he's been doing it ever since. So earlier I went down there and said to him that I don't care when he does it, just please try and keep it down early on the weekends because they are the only times I get to relax. He tells me he's busy during the week and he has to start early otherwise he'll never finish. I told him that he lives in a block of flats and needs to be more considerate otherwise people will start putting complaints in. Then he asks me what time would be considerate, I said maybe around 11-11:30am. He says that's too late and slams the door in my face and sure enough when I get back up to my place, he's still hammering away. It's so loud it sounds like it's actually coming from another room in my flat.

Anyways, I texted my friend about it and and she tellls me that I can't just go around policing people on what they do in their own homes, it's their right. I told her that's fair enough, but when you're being woken up early on the weekends after a long week, that's when it starts getting ridiculous. She said that I was the one being inconsiderate, expecting people to do what I say.

It's not like that at all. The guy lives in a flat, he has people living next door, above and below him. It's not fair that he thinks he can do whatever whenever just because he bought the place.

byij25	2019-06-09 09:27:49		AITA for not wanting to move back home with my boyfriend?	"My boyfriend and I have been living in the UK for about a year now. It’s the first time either of us have moved out of home, too. All things considered, it’s gone well, we never fight and we’re still madly in love ect. ect. We live with two other friends from home so we’re not alone, either.

Where were from in Australia is lovely if you’re settling down and want a quiet life but if you’re 22 it’s boring as shit. Same conversations with the same people at the same pub week in, week out.

Since being here, I’ve done a lot of standup (something that isn’t big at home) toured all over, I’m being booked for heaps of gigs, I’ve started writing for a magazine and am in the works of getting a sitcom made.

My boyfriend misses the weather and his friends. Fair. Wants to go home at the end of the year. Fair. I’ve agreed.

I don’t want to go home. At all. The only selling point is that now when he’s upset or sad, I won’t feel like it’s my fault for keeping him here. I feel like it will take strain off our relationship, whenever he complains about being here (a lot) it makes me feel guilty.
Other than that, at home I have no prospects and will have to go back to uni to be a primary school teacher... or something.

Also, because he’s unhappy I do all the housework, mainly in a bit to make it as nice as possible for him here. I’m not playing housewife at home though and I think him not pulling his weight will exhaust me. I’ve talked about moving out alone at home (I come from an abusive home and can’t go back to my parents) but he says he loves living with me.

He is the loveliest, sweetest, kindest person and I love him to bits and don’t want to lose him for following a pipe dream.
 
I mean, he came all this way for me, should I go back for him?

"So this past week I (17m) have been left at home with my (15f) sister while my mum has been away on holiday with a new partner. Everything had been fine for the first few days, we were both at school and generally kept out of each other's way at home. Friday night , my friend was having a get together at his place , which I'd spoke to my sister about , letting her know I'd be out that evening, saying to just order a pizza or whatever. 
  
She was fine about it , but when I got home (not even late mind about 10pm) I walked into the living room to see her with some random guy. I won't go into detail because it's gross for me to think about, but it's clear what their intentions were. I shouted at the boy to leave , which he obviously did straight away , and then I shouted at her for being irresponsible and sneaking around. I think I upset her because she started crying and said she was sorry and then ran upstairs. I sent my mum a message explaining what happened, and about an hour later my sister came back downstairs and asked me if I could not tell on her and that she wouldn't do it again. She seemed genuinely sorry, and she wasn't angry which would be her usual reaction to something like this. I explained that I just didn't want her to get hurt, and sometimes even with protection accidents happen. 
    
She doesn't know I've told on her yet, my mother just said she was gonna have a serious talk with her when she gets back. Idk whether or not I was in the right to tell her?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byie99	2019-06-09 09:06:03	throwaway72638102	WIBTA if I asked my dad to stop bringing his girlfriend around all the time	"Throwaway, because some people in my personal life  know my reddit account have absolutely no clue about my mother and I want it to stay that way. 

&#x200B;

For context, my mum passed away last year June when I was 17 from ovarian cancer. I also don't really know how frequently people hang out with their s/o's since I'm aro/ace and have absolutely no interest or clue about dating. My dad (50), since the start of this year has been seeing another woman. Who, I have absolutely no problem with, she's lovely and I'm glad my dad is moving on with her. My problem is that she always seems to be around our house, since the absolute beginning of their relationship. And frankly, as happy as I am for him, I am still uncomfortable being around her (my dad is very much aware of this). Most of the time, when she's at our house, I spend most of my time in my room, because I feel like I can't even walk around my house because, to me, there's a complete stranger there.

&#x200B;

My dad never even told me that he was dating her, she just started showing up at our house every other day, and at first I didn't want to say anything because I thought he would eventually tell me (and I didn't want to assume anything in case he was accusing me of anything and blew up on me), but I ended up confronting him about this after 2 months because I was so sick of him refusing to tell me anything. (It took me that long to confront him because my dad and I don't have a super close/intimate relationship and I feel like he never wants to actually sit down and have a conversation with me).

&#x200B;

We sat down, he apologized for not saying anything about it, and told me she was coming around so frequently because she was living with a roommate who worked from home, and it would be too awkward for them to hang out there. But in April she was going to move into a place that she was having built, and she would stop coming around as much. So it would be less awkward for me. Except she still comes over just as much (typically 4 times a week), and it still makes me very uncomfortable. 

&#x200B;

My biggest issue is that today marks my mum's one year death anniversary, and my dad and I went to go visit her grave today. Only for him to pick up his girlfriend and bring her back to our place for dinner. And this is kind of the tipping point for me, it just feels so wrong.

&#x200B;

A lot of my close friends have differing opinions, so would I be the asshole if I asked my dad to stop bringing his girlfriend around all the time (or suggesting they go elsewhere that isn't our house?), especially considering that she now has her own place?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Ok follwing Situation; She is my first and so far only gf. We have been together for close to 5 years now. We had some minor fights in this time(who doesnt) but overall i think things were good aside from 1 big thing which is linked to the situation at hand so it will come later. Right before the big problem occured she even asked me if i wantede to move in with her which i happily agreed to. Everything was good until i brought up the other big thing for some stupid reason. Side note she has a hobby that i only have minor connections to. The big thing was that about 3 years ago she confessed that she more or less fell in love with a different dude from her hobby. But not the i will leave you kind but the hey why not have an open relationship because i love you even more but wanna do things with others. Since i was widly in love and had absolutly no intrest in other women i felt devesated. We talked about it and i made it very clear that i would not be happy with that and that i dont see myself beeing okay with her  beeing with another dude. After mutch talking i reluctantly agreed for her to test it out with some restrictions and in a small scale like she can have 1 date with him and is allowed to kiss but nothing more. She acted like she was okay with it but didnt go through with it.

Now back to the present. I broucht that up for some stupid fucking reason. We talked a bit and after a while she confessed once again that she fell in love with yet another dude from her hobby(first dude moved away so hes gone), Once again she says i am more important to her then dude is but she ""wants to be close to dude"" aswell. And this is currently were we are for about 4 Months now. And the reason why I sometimes look through her phone is not becaue i dont trust her but because we both arent good in talking about what we feel. And she has a chat with 5 other girls from the same hobby and feels more confable talking about girls stuff with them. So i sometimes look at that chat to find out how shes thinking about the stuff without haveing to ask her directly which each time causes an argument and both of us to feel really bad."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byic2p	2019-06-09 08:56:04	AITA101	AITA for bugging my friend about not dating right after exiting an abusive relationship?	"  

Hi all,

My \[20M\] friend \[24F\] is homeless. As such, she's living with my until she can get on her feet. She's godmother to my niece \[2F\], who lives with me and is raised by me. My friend says my niece is the best part of her life -- conversely, she is my niece's favourite person. This is important for later. Additionally, my friend is a former sex addict. 

   
 

While homeless, she started dating a guy (April of this year). He tried convincing her several things -- such as to stop taking her anxiety meds and that I am at risk of beating her up (due to the fact I take antidepressants). There was a fair bit of emotional abuse. We had a lot of discussions about this, which she hated, and almost ended our friendship over it. When they broke up, she admitted I was right and that he was emotionally abusive. She said she shouldn't date until she's stable, and that when she does, our entire friendship group can meet him to give the thumbs up or down.

   
 

A fortnight later she met a guy \[33M\] on Tinder. They met once IRL, and started dating that day -- she didn't tell us until her lies became apparent. It's been about a week since then. In that time, he's trying to convince her to move to his place (an hour away) to start fresh without her old life (just incase her friendship group is a part of the problem). He also doesn't want to meet her friends -- he wants to protect her without interference.

   
 

We think her judgement is clouded and that she shouldn't be dating yet -- at least to wait until she has regular professional mental health help and a house. She thinks it's okay because this guy is going to 'save her from her life', and has retracted her previous statement about not dating. She understands that if she runs away she'll never see my niece again, and she says that sucks but it's a sacrifice she's willing to make. This is a complete 180 from her previous attitude, and I think she's being self-destructive.

   
 

As such, I've been bugging her to stop it with this guy and to see her psychologist (who has helped her with dangerous guys before). I believe she's emotionally vulnerable and that the last guy showed this quite clearly. I don't think it's unreasonable this is a similar situation. She believes if I am correct, it's her mistake to make, and that if I keep bugging her about this, she'll cut everyone off.

   
 

I am genuinely concerned. I THINK my idea is correct, but I honestly have probably been too forceful. I'm just not sure. She wants me to trust her judgement, but I feel it's clouded. AITA for being against this? Am I getting too involved? She has asked me to help her, but changed her mind, so I am unsure.

   
 

If I seem too biased, please tell me, and I'll try to elaborate a bit more fairly.

   
 

**tl;dr:** friend is homeless and vulnerable. Left an abusive partner recently. A fortnight later met another guy who is similar. Wants me to stop warning her about him."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Strangers ALWAYS come into my work and stay to tell me their emotional problems. I’ve done everything under the sun, to try and stop this. I establish boundaries and they stare at the line while crossing it.  
This girl who works at a bar in a near town, comes in and tells me I should work there because I have a “comfortable vibe”. I mention that I’ve considered that but I don’t want to end up dealing with drunk strangers emotional problems, and drinking sometimes = sad. She’s telling me that I’m being negative, it’s good to make a difference in strangers lives and basically she’s trying to convince me that I SHOULD work there/disregard my emotional well-being for strangers. I’m open about how much I don’t want to socialize and how much it drains me to carry strangers emotional burdens. She acted like I was heartless for being honest. I didn’t say it in a mean way, just an honest one. I used to like helping people, but I’m so drained. I can’t take on anymore emotional baggage. 
I’ve told other people about this story, and they reacted the same way. I looked up forums about this and found a bunch of answers from people saying things like “you’re helping people that’s what people like us are here for!” Or “it’s a blessing, be grateful!” And all of this other crap. So I HAVE to help people I don’t even know or care about, even when it takes a toll me?
I don’t want to be a free therapist for people I don’t even know. Therapists are getting $50-$100 an hour. They get paid a lot because taking in other people’s emotional baggage is a burden/ hard work. 

Am I seriously being negative? Tbh this makes me cry. Seemingly not many can relate to how much it drains, they think I’m an asshole for not wanting to listen to strangers for free, people think I’m being selfish. Strangers do this almost every time I work. I consider quitting my job over it.

This was days after she broke up with her boyfriend at the time. 

They haven’t stayed in touch since then, with communication being few and far in between. She now has a new boyfriend. Anyway, me and the guy have been spending more time together as we have a mutual interest in a combat sport.

My (31f) ex-fiancée (29f) and I recently broke up after 4 years together.  Recently meaning within the past month.  We have a house and a dog together and are trying to figure out our friendship and relationship.  We’ll still be cohabitating for the foreseeable future because of the mortgage and other reasons.  I’m not here for advice on that, though.

During the process of ending our relationship, my ex met someone and they are talking about starting a relationship.  This new person is in med school and is about to start a rotation which would cause her to not be home for at least 12 hours every day and she doesn’t have anyone to take care of her dog while she’s at work—no family around and no other options available.  She also lives in another state.

My ex asked me if I would be okay with her new love interest’s dog living with us during her time in this rotation.  I said no.  I’m not comfortable with taking care of this person’s dog and being one big happy blended family.  My ex said she would take care of the dog but there will definitely be times where the responsibility is solely placed on me.

I feel bad saying no because it’s not the dog’s fault but I can’t seem to get comfortable with the idea of being partially responsible for my ex’s new gf’s dog just because of my current living situation.  AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byi8xj	2019-06-09 08:40:14		AITA for never wanting to eat at uncle's house again?	"Bit of a backstory.

We live near our uncle's house. Aunt (uncle's wife) is kind of a hoarder. She hoards everything but mainly food. 

Once when we were in another city for couple of years she took every kitchen utensil from our home. She would hoard food in her refrigerator to the point of overflowing (we found sweets which had been in the fridge for one year). 

Because of our culture their home is considered main(as uncle is the eldest). Almost every family gathering happens there and throughout the years I have seen her being stingy with food and not giving enough to eat. 

It was their son's wedding. That day we were tired by evening. Uncle invited us to have supper there as there was lot of leftover food. 

We went to help in bag the leftovers (for neighbours and other family members) and there was this giant container of chicken which I noticed (leftover). 

Supper time. About half the family had food. Then I sit down to eat. Now the food is only non veg and among meat I eat only chicken. There is rice but rice needs something as side dish. 

I took some rice. I look for the chicken. She serves two pieces and leaves. I'm confused and anyway eat. I need more but she says it is finished. 

This makes me angry because I know that there is a lot lot left. My mum goes and begs to her. She says okay and comes with it. But I already finished my food and said I don't want it. 

I quietly clean up and leave. 

My (another) cousin notices that I left. I explain to her what has happened. She thinks I shouldn't be too mad at that and that I should continue to behave as if nothing happened. 

I said I have not even raised my voice or argued with her. But I am not going to ever eat at their place because I feel it is insulting. This has happened so many times now.

She says that I should let it go. I feel that while I can attend family gatherings I definitely do not want to eat there. 

After I left apparently aunt said that ""let her go if she's so angry"". She is saying that she had saved chicken for the next day .

My problem is that she lied to me about it being finished. If she had said the reason I would still have let it be. I am not a kid.

"So a little backstory: I met my best friend online at the beginning of 2017 & we've been friends ever since. We text every day, tell each other everything & essentially we're best friends despite the distance between us (we live in different countries). But trust me when I say that I consider him to be one of my best friends (and he says the same for me) and I would take a fucking bullet for him--I love the guy, he's my bestie. 

Now, due to the lack of financing on both ends and some other things, we were unable to meet up until these upcoming holidays. I'm finally going to see him this summer and I've never been more excited about anything in my life. It's  a meet-up 2.5 years in the making--you can see why I'm pumped. 

But before I get to finally, FINALLY see him, there's a... I guess a shared friend that goes to see him before me. Yes, I'm jealous. No, I don't think it's fair that someone who isn't even that close with my best friend gets to see him before me, just because they're financially able. 

I'm experiencing a bunch of emotions but I didn't want to be an ass towards my best friend. It's not like I don't want him to meet up with other friends, it's just getting on my nerves that I had to wait 2.5 years to see him while someone that isn't even that close to him gets to do that so much sooner. It doesn't feel fair to me. 

Obviously, I didn't dump all of this on my best friend. I just told him that I knew I would be sad I can't be there if I got any pictures or stories from that shared friends' visit. He said fine, that he won't say anything to me about that visit, but I feel like I'm the asshole."	No A-holes here	0	0	22.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

Me: Uhmm I'm not sure if I'm gonna be free
FWB: What do you have planned?

FWB: Ughh this is annoying, why don't you go fuck your friends then?

We’ve already had 3 mediated meetings, and can’t come to a compromise. I think she shouldn’t have her boyfriend over every single day, she thinks she should. She thinks I should keep the curtains open all day long, I think they should be closed when I sleep or nap. Fundamental differences. 

The only time any changes have happened are when I’ve posted an issue on my instagram, and she saw the post and got super upset. This prompted her to hang out with her boyfriend in other places, and to block me on social media, which is totally fine because I do NOT like this girl at all. 

I’m tempted to post something that she can see again. We have some mutual friends, so I know she will definitely see it, and I just can’t be up at 1 in the morning when she has her boyfriend over to sleep, or at 9 in the morning when she decides to invite him over and I have to change in front of him, which is super uncomfy.

"So last night me and my friend were chatting sharing memes the usual shit, my friend asked me when is my notice period is gonna get over since I mentioned to him that I am leaving my current job, I answered it's over so he followed it up with what's next? I replied I have another job lined up at so and so place,he kind of works in same domain but different role than me, this is where it starts to go downhill 

He says he knows all the companies in the said domain and this company's office isn't in my city,I said it's there and maybe he just doesn't know enough 

Then he literally said that don't fake it with some meta joke about topic of interest we share

I decided to pull a leg and said what if I decide to prove him wrong and show him the offer letter then he better compensate me it's all in joke I didn't plan to get anything from him

He is like sure man, then he tells me to name one person from the company over chat, at this point I decide to call him and said dude don't embarrass yourself man, you don't gotta doubt me with some meta jokes about topic of interest 

He talks over me telling me to spell the company's name because of my typo or something during text,he starts questioning me what the  company does?  Now this is the line where I lost my shit and I quote ""The attitude of the people at the said companies don't match with yours""  

I lost it and angrily said ""wtf does that mean? Are you are implying I cannot be at employed at said companies? With some more f words thrown in between"" and some rants that lasted around 60 seconds I guess


Dude disconnects the call and says over text that I am emotional and needs to calms down( which I agree is true) after that he badly apologies ""If you feel I was rude and arrogant...""  and that he never doubted my capabilities, I blocked him and cut off his attempt to call me

"I recently found out the gender of my baby and didn’t actually get around to texting some of my friends about it. I’ve been keeping this pregnancy pretty low key and don’t even plan on having a baby shower so definitely no gender reveal. Even now for the gender I didn’t really text anybody about it and would just let people know when and if I’d meet up with them as I just haven’t felt the need to make a big deal about baby related things. However, it was my friends birthday party tonight and since it was the first time seeing many of them since finding out the gender, I told them then and there while catching up and small talk. It just occurred to me now though that maybe my friend may not appreciate me sharing this news with her or our other friends during her birthday party..... could I have been an asshole?

EDIT: I’m getting a lot of YTA and noticed reference to a previous post. I’d appreciate if people could read my description of the night as I wasn’t exactly trying to “announce” it but it just came up in some conversations with people. I never brought it up to my friend until later in the night as I realized i had ended up mentioning the gender to quite a few friends and didn’t want her to think I told everyone but her, so mentioned it as a passing comment the next time I was having a convo with her. It was just a side comment :/. But after reading the said previous post about a baby announcement during their birthday, it made me wonder if by just even bringing it up to my friend it would’ve been an asshole move..."

We have been doing this for a few weeks and we were teaching him basic photoshop when i asked him if there was anything in particular he wanted to learn. He said ""yeah how do you draw realistic photos"" i asked him to get specific and he said ""that wierd ass porn japanese people draw"" and he chuckled, so i started laughing with him. 

Then i asked what specifically he had in mind and he said ""im not really into that, they draw some wierd ass shit"" and i agreed, he then said ""i swear they wouldnt draw wierd shit if we just bombed pearl harbour again"". This had my sides in fucking orbit, hes a pretty bright kid so i figured he was being ironic, and he knew pearl harbour was not in japan. He didnt. He then said ""bro that wasnt kek"" and it made me actually tear up from laughing so hard. Me and all my friends were crying on the floor.

This kid then got mad because he wasnt joking, and he infact thought we bombed pearl harbor, and that pearl harbor was in japan. He then told his special support person that we were bullying him, and we all lost our credits, even the credits for the work we had already done.

I really thought he was being ironic or i wouldnt have laughed, and even if he wasnt, idk how autism works but apparently he barely has it and is pretty much normal, plus he is far too old to not know anything about ww2.

Do not try an lecture me about having an attitude when you know literally nothing about how I may or may not be feeling at that particular time.

I will also be, as I always have, accepting responsibility for when I make mistakes or derail my life because it was my own fault, not blaming it on others. Because I can identify things that are wrong and help myself like an adult.

byhxgh	2019-06-09 07:46:16	CharrAnn	AITA for making my friend stay in during Pridefest?	"First off, happy Pride everybody!
Anyways, I'm from the east coast and I came to the Midwest for Pridefest. I'm staying with my best friend (we do this every year). Well, unfortunately, my body hates me when i travel. I get sick all the time, my stomach is extremely sensitive, my body is pretty weak, and I have the flu on top of it. It's pretty funny cuz this only happens when I'm not in New Jersey. Well, tonight was Saturday night and it's usually just a rave. Earlier in the day, I had to babysit best friend's little brother (who is fucking awful but I try to be nice anyways) because best friend ditched him due to sensory overload, which would be fine except I saw him with two people hanging out that he claims to not even like. I tried to brush it off and see the band I wanted to see anyways (She Wants Revenge) but I only made it two songs in before little brother started crying saying that he wants his bro and all that jazz. Unfortunately best friend had left the spot he was at because he was ""just walking around"" according to the text he sent when I asked him where he was. Then while looking for him, little brother wouldn't stop bothering me to buy him a $40 set of furry ears. I literally can't afford that, so I said no, but he just wouldn't shut up. Eventually I found best friend's mom cuz she was teaching a zumba class. I dropped the kid off with her and that's when best friend came back. He wanted to change into rave clothes for the gay night rave. By the time we get home, I'm exhausted. I'm beat. I'm throwing up in my mouth. My stomach hurts. My feet hurt. I'm dehydrated. Most of all, I needed a nap. So he told me I can sleep for 20 minutes and I did. When he came to wake me up so we can go back, I couldn't force myself out of bed without nearly puking. I told him I've been sick all day (which is true because his mom noticed it in the morning when we saw her to get little brother) and his brother fucking killed my energy. He was very mad because now he couldn't go (we take buddy system very seriously at raves for very obvious reasons. Really everyone should. Stay safe) and he didn't wanna go tomorrow despite it being a rave the whole time as well and him not having plans. I fell asleep and woke up a few hours ago to see that he told our group chat about this, which is fine, but he really made it seem like I ruined Pride for him and everyone agreed, which hurt admittedly. So I'm wondering if maybe I am an asshole or if this is just a case of bad timing, like i previously thought. I get Pride is VERY important (we're both gay and it's the only time of year we really get to be ourselves and not afraid thanks to the areas we live in), but I feel like maybe some things, like health, should be important too.

byhvmw	2019-06-09 07:37:51	ClumsyYeti	AITA for wanting to apply for minimum wage jobs against my family's wishes?	"I'm a late 20s F from the EU.   
I took a while (way too long, imo) to get my 2 BA degrees (double subject studies - 2 foreign languages) as it is due to pretty big issues with mood and anxiety. I have an unfinished MA which I'm hoping to get back to and finish in the next year/when I can afford to, but meanwhile I've been looking for work in my field (so mostly foreign language tutoring/translation - and related fields). I moved back to my parents house about a year ago due to financial reasons.  
I've been sending out applications for the past.. 6-7 months or so and haven't had any luck - nothing past getting interviews/""trial"" stuff anyway. There's 3 things working against me - lack of **formal** experience in the field, the unfinished (tho really only missing my dissertation - I passed every single exam) MA degree, and the fact that I live in a town with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. I've been going to CV/interview/job seeking advice workshops and  I meet up with an employment agency career counselor about every month or two.

Honestly I'm tired of sitting around at home doing nothing. My mental health is suffering, I have no financial freedom (any income is spent on food/gas/other living expenses). I'm BORED and feel so useless.

I've tried suggesting looking for at least part time or min wage work and my family is convinced it's ""beneath me/us"" and I'd be embarrasing them and ""throwing away my education"", and that I'm too old to do ""the work that no-education 18yo kids do"".  


And if I do apply to work in retail/fast food etc I can ""f\*ck off and move out and they're taking back my car (which is entirely in my mother's name as they covered about 2/3 of the price when we bought it - it was implied that it was meant to be shared between me and my mother but my mother has legit not driven since about 1995 - no exaggeration. I have issues with the car as it is as I wanted a cheap older car in the <2000€ range and family insisted on something almost almost brand new that was 5x the cost)""

I don't see the problem with working in a low income job since I don't see how it would prevent me from continuing the job hunt in my own field... while actually having a life and an income. They see it as a waste of uni/my degree. Will I be the asshole if I go against their wishes, considering it could seriously damage our relationship? Am I the asshole for moving back to my parents house in the first place?

My family isn't rich by any means, my parents are right in the ""average income"" bracket for where we live (my parents have kept the same job since the mid 80s, when Yugoslavia had scholarships/almost guaranteed employment for their vocation - they've literally never had to look for a job in their entire life). I do see how it would suck watching your only kid struggle through uni and then seemingly ""abandon"" their education but I'm at the end of the rope. I honestly don't know if I'm being the ass."

byhvf8	2019-06-09 07:36:49	Bfhehsbsb	AITA for ditching 'friends' that were going nowhere in life and hanging out with the popular guys?	"I made a pact at the beginning of summer break to spend these three months improving myself. Thus far my life has been a pretty huge mess: loads of stress, crashing and burning in relationships, depression and frustration with the general tedium of high school. I want to stop this from happening again or at least build myself up so I have the mental fortitude to deal with it.

I'm a firm believer that you are extremely influenced by those you hang out with. And most people I hang out with are going nowhere in life: I don't mean this as an insult, just an fact. I measure 'not going anywhere' not really by the situation of your life, but how you feel about it. To show what I mean, I'll compare myself to a guy in the he group named Andy: both our lives were gigantic messes. I want to change mine for the better, but he's just accepted, in his own words, that he's 'always going to be a loser'. I hate that attitude, so I've told Andy and my former friend grou in general that I won't hang out with them anymore.

Instead, I've been hanging out more with my school's popular kids: besides being popular, most of them are emotionally well-adjusted and positive and also excel at some hobby or club (sports, debate, art, music, etc). Hanging out with them, besides being fun, has inspired me to improve myself.

 Andy has taken offense to this, saying that I've sold out. I don't think I'm TA for hanging out with who I want.

I figured he was probably encountering some girl problems so I asked him what was wrong. Then he went on saying if people aren't interested in talking to you on dating app. They should just stop responding, replying with short answer is just wasting time. And saying ""dating apps are stupid and these women are stupid"" I told him I understand it can be annoying but he needs to accept the fact that everyone is different. ( He said he accepted it and not at all hurt by it, which isn't the true I believe) If he is not happy with the answer just stop replying and move on. He kept on going and defending himself. So I decided to assure him and basically told him that I understand chatting up girls can be hard. And he probably met a lot of girls online that are hard to talk to at the moment. But he has also met some wonderful girls online before. He told me: oh not many girls. Just one that is being unresponsive. LOL which I thought it is so ridiculous so being upset at something like this. He kept up complaining and trying to prove his point. So then I just told him: ""You need to stop acting like a 16 years old boy. That is half your age."" And he just exploded. Saying I am being extremely annoying and told me to piss off.

In my defense, I do think this is something very trivial and not worth putting your energy into it. (Especially it is only one girl that is giving him short answer) I have been on dating apps and I have met countless of people like that. You just move on. End of the story. I didn't want to feed him more negative energy and I certainly do not think it is mature to blame all the women just because there is one girl that is not being very responsive to him on dating app. But he thinks I was not empathetic at all and I was being an asshole not a good listener.

Well, since we have shared a bedroom for most of our lives, we have taken to chatting in the dark before bedtime until one of us falls asleep. During those nighttime chats, we say stuff that we would never say during the day. Not sure what it is about 11pm-1am but during those hours you just get really emotional and stuff, yknow? 

So anyway. During those chats, we've shared some pretty intense tea - which kid got in trouble during class that day, which boy we were eyeing, which best friend committed betrayal - you know the stuff. Naturally as we got older the things we talked about turned to future life plans, career options, university plans, we even talk about my abusive mom sometimes. So as a result, the material shared is sometimes very personal.

Every time she needs my advice on something I will try to suggest something, or at least try to comfort/side with her. Even if I'm seriously not even the least bit interested in what she wants to say, I at least pretend to listen and occasiomally say ""yeah"" and ""oh that sucks"" and the like. At least she feels like I'm listening. 

But on the contrary, every time I tell her something, she just says ""k"" or ""shut up I'm tired"" or just ignores me altogether. Basically quite cold towards me. This has only started happening recently and idk what to make of it. I thought maybe she's going through something and isn't ready to tell me yet, or perhaps does not want to tell me. That's fine, I respect that and continue listening to her tales of her life while shutting up about my own.

One day I was feeling particularly melancholy cos I miss my crush. Things got complicated between us and I had no one to tell so I thought I would tell her. Guess what, after my long and emotiomal monologue in the dark, she replies with ""K. No one needs to hear about your love life.""

Well. That was really rude and I had to stop myself from physically hurting her. I've started to think that the only way I can deal with this is if I gave her a taste of her own medicine. Maybe not say rude things like she did, but just ignore and give one word replies. It's asshole behaviour but I feel like I have to. WIBTA?

Because of this we don't get to see each other very often and so I make it a point to go visit her from time to time since she does not currently have a car or even a license. 

When we do hang out, it's usually an all day affair -- so we usually end up hanging out till pretty late. We had gone to the beach in a town about 30 minutes away from where she lives. So as our day ended around 9, I asked her how to get back to her place since she knows the area well. She directs me but accidentally sends me on the wrong freeway and we ended up driving about 20-25 minutes in the wrong direction. 

Midway through the drive she admits that she sent us the wrong way. Hearing this, I get frustrated and ask her why she didn't let me know earlier. She then gives me a half-assed sorry and does not offer any type of help with gas or even a thank you. Keep in mind this is usually the case when we hang out: I am the one who has to do all the driving and never receive any kind of gratitude for all of the gas and wear and tear I put through my car. I understand that mistakes do happen but to wait until we're about 20 -25minutes in the opposite direction absolutely confuses me. 

All of sudden she gets upset for calling her out on it and starts giving me the cold shoulder. I say I'll just look through google maps and the fastest way to get to her place is through a freeway that she says is dangeous and instead suggest we go the long way around. At this point, I am done and tell her we're going the faster route, if not she could take an uber home. She then agrees and tells me to just drop her off anywhere. I really didn't want to do this but I was exhausted at this point and would require to drive me an additional 3 hours on myself. I asked her multiple times that I do not mind dropping her off but that I needed at least a coffee but her mind had been set at this point. I left her at an In-N-Out (best burger place--don't @ me) and asked her one final time that I will drop her off but that we are taking the ""dangerous"" freeway. She gave me a no and I had no choice but to leave her at the restaurant.

TL;D: Hang out with friend who lives far away. After ending long day, friend takes me in wrong direction which puts an additional 3 hours of driving on me. I get frustrated with friend who does not offer help. She gets upset so she gets dropped off after her insistence an hour away from her home."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	119.0	16.0	0.0	0.0

This one lady kept inching her stool closer to me until she was very uncomfortably close. I firmly told her to please move away as I am getting uncomfortable. For some reason I got s free drink and a anonymous person got me another beer and I was so confused as I don’t know why anyone would do that. This same rude ass lady comes back up after she walks away and asks if she can have some because it was free and I was like wtf. I told her no because she was already being annoying. Since I was only gonna have one beer So I could drive I just gave the drink to another friend I was there with. I am 18 male and was told I was being too mean to her.

We had some issues with his family, and we drew back. Then just last week we agreed to have her stay there for a week. (With his mom and grandma) I have never liked his mom but I respect her for she raised my baby when I was in the hospital for the first year of my daughters life. Ok. Cool. They raised her when we couldnt for the first year, and now we got it. Thank you. 
Dude, our daughter goes over there with long, growing beautiful curls and comes back with mutilated hair. Its so bad. Its embarrassing. We were supposed to go to a birthday party tomorrow, but we wont be attending. I know what people will say. Other kids will make fun of her. Shes already socially anxious and needs more interaction with other children. I cant do that to her man. Its really *THAT* bad. 

I missed all of her ""firsts"". I wasnt well enough to be there so I missed so many beautiful moments. The walking, the talking, the growing. The last thing I had was her hair. I was adamant to everyone about not touching her hair. This woman hardly ever sees my baby anymore and now shes robbed me of my very last & final ""first"" of her baby years. Shes butchered her hair. My heart feels broken. I know this sounds dramatic and petty because its hair. But it feels deeper. 

My ex tells me to let it go. Hes talked to her and told her ""it wouldn't happen again"". He doesnt want me to make things worse. Im fucking livid, guys. Im hurt. I feel disrespected all the way around. I plan to call her tomorrow and tell her shes not to have my kid for overnights anymore. I plan to say a bit more than that most likely. Would I be an asshole if I went behind his back and handled it differently?? It feels like it could start a lot of issues but I just dont know what to do.

byhqdu	2019-06-09 07:12:54	CrazyTheKureiji	AITA for not wanting alcohol at my birthday party	"So my 16th birthday is coming up and my parents are excited. They want to throw me a big party to celebrate. I normally don’t do parties because of my anxiety and I just don’t like big parties in general but I figure since it’s my sweet 16 there’s no harm in it.

So today my parents and I were leaving a party we had with their friends for their daughters birthday party.
Just some background info, my parents and all the other parents of the neighborhood love to throw parties in their driveways/backyards which is fine, but they ALWAYS drink alcoholic drinks. I don’t care what adults do but they hype it up so much. They will go on about how good whatever they are drinking is and start cheering about it. Then when I ask if I can try it they all say no and get quiet. Fast forward back to the car my parents were still talking about how good whatever they were drinking was and started talking about bringing it to my party and the people they were going to invite (which were people I don’t even know) and abunch of other party details. I said something along the lines of “woah what” because they were planning so fast and they said “oh nothing” like I was budding in on their private weekend plans. I said “I don’t want alcohol beverages at my party” and my dad went off about how not everything is about me and I can’t control what they do, he yelled about how he was throwing me a party and I should be grateful. I told him I never wanted a party in the first place and he called me selfish. 

He was gonna take me for ice cream on the way home but he said he wasn’t going to and my mom took me instead. She told me every parent looks forward to throwing a sweet sixteen party and it’s selfish of me to deny them that. I went off on her about how I didn’t care about the party, I just don’t want alcohol and people I don’t know at MY birthday party. My anxiety would build up and I would just end up locking myself in my room while no one even notices I’m gone. My mom said I can just take my three friends and stay in my room but is that even okay if it’s my party? I’m also mad because she said she would invite the family who’s party I was leaving from during the car ride previously mentioned (who I don’t know that well). She said “just eat your pizza, open your gifts, and hide in your room like you always do.” I told her I just want my friends and family there and I’d let them bring alcohol if it was just my family because I feel like they are all just looking for a reason to get together and drink some more. She told me she would just take me and my friends out to eat and my dad and his friends could stay at home. I’m extremely pissed that I can’t change one thing in a party that I didn’t even want to have and I’m being called selfish for that? If everyone is upset because they can’t have alcohol at a party then they have issues.

So am I in the wrong?

byhq35	2019-06-09 07:11:37		AITA: For making comments about a frirnds smoking habits?	"My friend Jane in 2018 had been sober for two years her drugs of choice heroin and alcohol. She had spent a year in a residential treatment program and six months of sober living. In August of 2018, she started smoking weed again. I didn't make comments or criticism because she's 26 and at the time was working full time. She says she needs it for sleep because of nothing else works. She would sometimes smoke and drive or smoke weed on breaks at work.


She sees a therapist weekly and does not see a psychiatrist. Recently she quit her job because she said her therapist told her to ”take it easy.” she hasn't worked in eight weeks and thinks she can lie on her resume and say she worked longer at her old job. She says she wants to go back to school but hasn't toured any or seem to take much initiative. She said she's taking this summer off before the new semester. I know she smokes daily, but she gets mad at my comments and says she doesn't smoke that much.

She's a trust fund baby, so she lives off of it in a studio apartment in Southern California. She said her therapist approves of her smoking and says they are processing a lot of things right now. She has issues stemming from abuse by her brother and her parents doing her homework or revising it without her knowing making her feel stupid.

I made comments recently about how I was concerned about her smoking and not working or at least going to school. She doesn't need to do full time, but she needs some type of structure. She got super mad at me and is ignoring me saying it's not my place. She got defensive and said she's done a tone of research which I doubt.

Should I be concerned? Was I in the wrong?Am I the asshole?

tl;dr: alcoholic and ex-heroin addict started smoking weed and quit her job. I'm concerned, but she gets defensive at my comments."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
byhov3	2019-06-09 07:06:26		WIBTA if I told my aunt she's not invited on our holiday?	"I lived with my grandparents while I was an undergrad. They gave me a place to live and I helped them around the house. So I've got a pretty special relationship with them.

&#x200B;

My oldest aunt (65) has done a lot for my grandparents. She visits them more often than anyone, as she's semi-retired and lives nearby. 

But she's also bonkers. She can't read social situations well, especially other people's discomfort. She never wears fewer than four different brightly-coloured patterns at a time. She thinks she's developed a radical new method for 'curing autism'. She brings the cheapest thing she can find to family gatherings, or nothing at all. If there's any food around, like a salad or cake at a family lunch, she picks out and eats the best bits before it's served. She used to eat my labelled food out of my grandparents' fridge when I lived there. She tries to help my grandma by making 'anti-dementia' smoothies, which taste like a banana's anus after a turmeric colonoscopy. My grandma hates being forced to drink them. Basically my aunt thinks she works harder/helps a lot more than she actually does. 

&#x200B;

These days, my grandma is in a nursing home and doesn't remember anyone. My grandfather is 90. On New Year's Day, I asked him what he'd do this year. He usually says something like 'fuck-all,' but this time he said, 'Go to Queensland. What do you think?' I thought he'd be too sick to go, but I also remembered all the times he supported my lofty creative ambitions (like publishing my novels), so I told him he should go for it. 

Anyway, he took it to heart and has invited Mum and me on a trip to Queensland, where we all used to go on holiday as a huge family (about 30 of us altogether). I've just finished my Masters degree and Mum has got some time off work. My grandpa has been looking forward to it for months, and insists on paying for everything. His favourite carer is coming too, but we want her to have a good time and plan on sharing the work of caring for him as much as possible. We have one four-bedroom unit booked and one hire car for a week - just enough for the four of us.  


The trouble is, my aunt keeps talking about coming on holiday. And while my grandpa hasn't invited her, he hasn't exactly said no, either. He goes away on weekends in the country with her now and then, but apparently that's not enough for her. I keep worrying about what she'll do next. I keep imagining a parade of mad scenarios with her at the centre of all of them. My mum can't stand her sister, but won't say anything because she doesn't want to start a huge drama.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - my 90-yo grandpa is taking Mum and me on what is probably his last holiday, and I'm worried my crazy aunt will show up and make it all about her. The trip is next week.

byho3c	2019-06-09 07:03:06	Ajreil	AITA for letting my friend serve me lunch, then adding spices and extra ingredients to mine?	"A good friend of mine cooked dinner for me recently. It was a pretty informal setting, just a quick bite to eat while before we left for town.

The meal was nothing extravagant, but she put about 20 minutes into cooking it. It was a quick meal made from beef, noodles and tomatoes. Three ingredients, sautéed in a skillet and served on paper plates. 

It was honestly pretty good. I complimented her on her cooking, and said I enjoyed it.

After that I decided to tweak it a bit. I added chili powder, a couple of extra spices, and a drop of olive oil.

We've cooked together before, and she has always allowed me to help myself to her pantry, so this wasn't a problem. I was very quiet about adding spices, because I didn't want to criticize her cooking. I just quietly added a few spices to my second plate.

This wasn't my intention, but she took my tweaks as criticism. She said that doing so told her the original dish wasn't good enough, and ""must have been lacking."" To be fair, this wasn't just adding a bit of salt. The chili powder significantly changed the meal.

We didn't really discuss it after a quick two sentence back and forth. She expressed her frustration, and I said it was good either way, but better with a touch of chili powder.

I assumed the issue ended there, but she brought it up while driving a few hours later. Evidently she was more offended than I had believed, so I apologized.

Let me explain a bit about our personalities to help explain why this happened. 

I have a pretty utilitarian view on food. When I make someone a meal, I want them to enjoy it. If that means adding something extra, that's fine. Whatever makes the meal better for them.

My friend is a little more emotional. She doesn't respond well to feedback, which is why I didn't say anything when I added the extra spices. I also made sure to say it was good before trying anything else. In fact, I said that after my first bite before even considering adding anything else. 

Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: To clear up some common concerns:

1. I really did enjoy it the way she made it, and I was clear on that. I had a full plate and honestly enjoyed it before adding any spices. The original dish was good, but it could be better. 

2. The idea that improving something counted as criticism didn't even occur to me. I knew she didn't take criticism well, which is why I didn't do say anything negative. This isn't something I could have seen coming.

3. If I made food for someone and they significantly changed it, I honestly wouldn't be bothered. As long as they enjoy it I'm happy."	Asshole	0	0	16892.0	1870.0	0.0	0.0
byhnju	2019-06-09 07:01:01	oneanxiousho	WIBTA If I approach a donator who preferred to remain anonymous?	"I'm going to keep this pretty vague for privacy reasons. 

One of my parents died a few months back and it was a really hard time. I was living with my sister at the time, and I was financially supporting her. between rent and other bills, I couldn't afford a funeral for my parent. the cremation and actually moving my parent to a closer facility was hundreds of dollars. It ended up being a bit over $3k. I made a post about it asking if anyone would commission me for graphic arts or for creative writing (as I often take them through social media). I had my ko-fi link available (which for those who don't know, you can donate in incriminates of $3). I didn't expect much, but all of the sudden I look at my account and I had a $200 from one person. They decided to remain anonymous and left no name on the ko-fi donation. 

Ko-fi runs through PayPal and because of it, the donators name was available. I didn't realize nor was I trying to pry— I had thanked the anon person publicly since I didn't know who it was... till I went to check my PayPal for a different business matter,  and saw the name associated with the donor by mistake. It was a friend I had throughout middle school. They were a really cool person that I enjoyed hanging out. They were a bit shy and couldn't hang out much (strict parents), but after we went to different high schools we sort of split off. 

WIBTA if I approached them and thank them? Would it be an invasion of privacy because they chose to remain anonymous? Should I offer to pay them back in incriminates? This person gave a lot to me and I want to thank them for what they did, but they also decided to remain anonymous for a reason. I'm not sure if messaging them with the fact that I know it was them would be crossing a line or anything... It's been months and again, this person hasn't messaged me either. I get the feeling that they want to remain anonymous still but again, they gave me a lot in a time where I was desperate."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

byhkip	2019-06-09 06:47:11	GaMaLlama	AITA for giving my friend the cold shoulder?	"A little bit of backstory; I met this girl on tinder, we hung out at my place a few times, never went past making out but enjoyed hanging out together. I wasn't feeling anything for her romantically and could see she really likes me so I called things off before it got to a point where it's difficult to end things. She was cool with it and asks if we can just be friends, I agreed because I still enjoy her company. 

Now, this is relevant to my question; everytime she has come over to my place, she has stressed her curfew and made sure that she leaves at a certain time, not because she isn't allowed to stay out, but because they only have one remote for their gate so someone in her family would have to stay awake to open for her.

Anyway, so we went hiking together yesterday, came back to my place and hung out for a bit. I told her I was super tired from the hike so wanna hit the hay early because I'm also busy the following day and have to be up early. She said okay no worries then her sister phoned her shortly after that and asked her how long she will be, she said like 30 mins or so. So she asks me if she can do a tarot card reading on me, I agree but first asked, what about getting home in 30 mins? If we do this first, you definitely won't be home in time. She said no, it will be fine. I didn't insist, she is an adult and knows when she needs to be home. We do the card reading (apparently I'm going to be rich one day). Then I take her home. When we get there, we ring the bell, no one comes to open, she tries to phone a couple of times and no one answers the phone. Then she says, ""They must all be sleeping, I guess we should just go back to your place and then I'll Uber home in the morning"" . I didn't want her to sleep over at my place because I can see she still has feelings for me so I didn't want her to get any ideas and I live in a tiny place so we would have to sleep in the same bed. I obviously couldn't leave her there so she came back to my place. My issue is, she knows her curfew and stayed later knowing she might be locked out.

Now it's been a long day, I'm tired, it was a far drive to the hiking trail and back so I'm proper knackered and cranky. Feeling like I've just been manipulated by her, I was super annoyed so let my emotions get the better of me and just gave her the cold shoulder the whole drive back, went straight to sleep when we got back to my place and kept conversations short before she left in the morning because I needed to get started with my day. She wasn't leaving so I had to tell her to order the Uber, which annoyed me further because she knew I had a busy day ahead. So, reddit, AITA for getting annoyed with her and giving her the cold shoulder?

For context, I'm involved in student politics at my uni. Student political parties are extensions or offshoots of actual parties or movements in the country, with students joining whichever they agree with. The major parties at my uni are a socialist party (exactly what it sounds like), a centre-left coalition (think US Democrats) and the centre-right coalition (think US libertarians- socially the same as the centre-left, but favoring free markets). I'm a member of the centre-right, which is in charge (not to brag, but they came to power due to my campaign tricks). Anyhow, the joke in the party (joke as in everyone says it but everyone knows it's not true, which is why they laugh) is that I'm the puppet master. My best friend is the chairman of the party, I'm the one who convinced him to run and everyone else to vote for him, etc. I don't have any official position in the party, but essentially serve as a generalist: I write speeches, negotiate with the other parties, and do stand-up comedy. I basically don't want to be the leader because of the pressure, so I just do whatever strikes my fancy.

There's a girl who is also involved in the same party, let's call her Ana. I have a crush on her and asked her out, and she said yes. Some members of the other parties in the school newspaper attacked me, saying I'm 'using my authority' to 'force' a junior member to go out with me. I don't think that's true, considering I have no authority in the party to begin with. I even asked Ana if she only dated me because of 'authority', and she said no. I'm usually pretty good at spotting lies, and I think she's telling re truth.

I hit a strike and I was excited and I turned around and she didn’t notice I said “thanks for noticing my strike” and she said “oh sorry I was distracted”.

byhhxt	2019-06-09 06:35:43		AITA for wanting to cut ties with my best friend because she can’t stop talking about her workplace and her boyfriend who works there?	"Hey, so let’s start from the beginning. My best friend and I have been friends throughout high school, specifically junior and senior year. During senior year, we both got jobs in the restaurant industry where she was a hostess at one restaurant in the city and I was a food runner at another just 10 blocks down. She was definitely more excited than I was about working at a restaurant.

My best friend started to update me more on her workplace and everyone that she knew who happened to have connections to her sisters. I thought “that’s perfectly fine: we’re in different and new settings and it brings good conversation”. But she was ALWAYS talking about how she was able to drink with her coworkers and that they were very much in love with her as a hostess. By the 20th time, she was talking about the sous chef being deliberately flirty with her and asking her to fuck him? I was done with the topic. I was just weirded out that there was no sense of professionalism in her workplace. Yet I couldn’t gather the courage to call her out on her behavior. When I expressed that I was disgusted by the way people view her at work, she told me that. I just don’t understand because I don’t work there. However, this was the first time that she expressed that she felt confidence and truly happy and I felt that as a best friend, it would be shitty of me to lash out on her. I always told her to be careful and trusted her to make her own boundaries so I never really “laid down the law”.

It got worse when she broke the news that she was dating the head chef of the restaurant. I couldn’t even fathom the idea of dating a head chef because that just shows the unprofessionalism of the business. It was impossible to get anything in unless it was a response or reaction to something she was telling me about him. Every minute was about him and how she was so in love with him or about how she’d rather spend time with him than be at school. I became incredibly discontent with our friendship and at one point, I just said “We should really just keep track of how many times you mention him in one day because you talk about him a LOT”. She apologized and told me that I’m the only one she can talk to about him because no one else accepts it. I sighed and just kept letting it happen. She started skipping school to hang out with him and would sometimes suggest I walk her to her workplace so she could meet up with him. She would also tell me ALL THE TIME about how she just wants to be with him at that very moment, when she’s hanging out with me.

I’ve never been a big fan of confrontation. Even if I did confront her, I don’t know if she’d even take it into consideration. I find it hard to open up to her and I’m pretty sure that she feels as if I can’t understand any of the things she’s going through. I just feel as though it’s best to let the relationship go now that we are going to different colleges and leading different lives.

She returns from lunch and tells me she already washed my lunchbox and returned it on top of my locker. I step out of the office to check it out. This is where I notice the rubber seal in my lunchbox is missing. Meaning my lunchbox won’t close and the lid won’t seal. 

I return to the operations to confront her (i was honestly fuming at this point, i had no other lunchbox). 

She says she has no idea where it went and it prolly fell somewhere. I say bullshit since that part cannot be removed by accident. I tell her to look for it. She looks for it but tells me she cannot find it. 

I tell her, if you can’t locate it by tomorrow then you either pay for it or replace my lunchbox. She says, “it’s just a lunchbox cant you get another one?” I say, “it’s my only lunchbox! I will get another one if you pay for it.” Other people are looking at me and her at this point. We both return to work and she doesn’t speak to me for the rest of the day. But before i leave the office i tell her, “If you can’t find it then replace/pay for it.”

I told my parents about it and they were pretty mad as well. My dad had to give me his lunchbox just so i could have something to eat on Saturday (this means he wasn’t able to bring any food to his office and had to eat take out food). The next day at work, she doesn’t show up. 

I spoke to another co worker did tell me that I over reacted just for a lunchbox and to just get another one.

We're attempting to make new friends, but it can be slow going when you don't have any social networks. Last night my wife got home around 2 hours later than she normally does, but I figured she was probably out doing some chore. When she got home she started telling me about a friend she made. ""Good for her"", I initially thought, until I asked for more details. Apparently she started talking to another passenger in an Uber (let's call him Tony""). They were stuck in traffic and had an sizable chunk of time to get to know each other. The uber driver goes to drop Tony off at his place, at which point he invites my up to his place to ""continue the conversation"". To my horror, my wife accepted and spent the last hour and a half at his place.  


She can tell I was annoyed as she recounted this and asked what was wrong. I was upset that she went into a strange mans house who was most likely trying to hit on her. She said I was being ridiculous and that she was just making a new friend. I brought up that if he did try something no one would know where she was at. She countered that she was a grown woman and could make her own choices.

A majority of these events are held in a 3 bed beach house where up to 12-15 people cram themselves on (couches, air mattresses, recliners and on one occasion a tent, which I then had to Leave for my car because it was HOT. I know family is important, but does communal sharing of misery a caveat? Tonight, we get a bed—hard as a board...

This weekend is the last straw for me. It is her grandmother’s 85th birthday. She was recently diagnosed with stage 0 melanoma. If someone tells you you have the Big C no matter what stage you’d be scared. I oblige her  I tell her, We’ll go. We leave Saturday morning at 8AM, I made a wrong turn and it set us back. It brings my stress levels up a bit, but we made it.

She had told me, in weeks before, I would be able to relax since I don’t get to do that at home. Instead, I find myself decorating with a her nerd cousin, who is the sweetest guy in the world. He empathizes with me that coming time after time is crazy. We then find ourselves baby sitting 4 kids who are fueled on laffy taffy. One of whom stole 2 of my beers and said “[his] mom said ‘it was cool’.” Which of course turned out to be a lie. I tried to confront his mom about it, but my gf’s bro cousin said not to bring it up, at least not now, given it is grandma’s birthday—piss on that, it’s my alcohol that a 13 yo stole from me.

They tell us where to meet up, they’re loud and obnoxious at a pretty decently nice winery. The girlfriend is telling me to take pictures of the ladies all taking jack shots—grandma’s favorite. As people are looking at us at this decently nice establishment I’m mortified. Also, I can’t get anything to eat because we’ll be eating at the cottage for her birthday—I’m h-angry!

After an hour. we’re sitting for dinner her dad makes a tongue-in-cheek joke about me knowing all the good Asian restaurants in the city we live in...I assume he said that because I am Asian in a house full of German-poles. I’m cool with him fucking with me. but not if front of a bunch of people I don’t have that kind of closeness to, it sets a precedent for others to fuck with me even though I really don’t know who they are.

Then her uncle asks about my heritage/ethnicity I tell him about my mom and dad were immigrants and how my dad made his living as a Quality Assurance Scientist. He makes a contemptuous comment about my dad’s line of work. Granted my dad is an asshole, he doesn’t know that. My dad provided for us, made a shit-ton of money, and retired, comfortably. This is coming from a guy who is contract job hopping.

It’s about 12:00 the gf, aunt with the klepto son, et al. are in the side room loudly laughing. I want to get some sleep.

byhcht	2019-06-09 06:12:24	AITAThrowaway4749601	AITA for kicking out my mother.	"Hey Reddit.

I've always had a complicated relationship with my mother, who thinks that boundaries and privacy shouldn't apply to close family. Every time I set a boundary, she cries, and she pouts if I try to enforce them. A lot of my family looks down on me for setting them in the first place because they think I should be more grateful. For the record, I'm not doing anything I find unreasonable, for example, the last boundary I had to set was telling her never to rearrange any of my things. She knows that 3 strikes means she goes home.

On a recent visit, and with my father there, (they are still together) she started loudly talking about how annoying he was and about how he never listened. I cut her off and told her that it was inappropriate for her to talk about my father that way to me, and that if she was having issues, she needed to go to counselling or see a friend. 

Later on, she tried picking a fight with him in my living room over a movie to watch, and I told her that she was not to fight with my dad in my home. She pouted and said she couldn't help it, and I told her that wasn't reasonable, and that it was rude to fight in other people's homes. 

The next day, when we were out for a coffee, she started in on him again. I got up, told her I was going home, and that her visit was cut short, but that Dad was welcome to come with me. He did, and expressed gratitude for the break from the fighting. 

She called me when she got home and told me I was a nasty and ungrateful child and that I had no right to tell her what to do. I just told her we could have a conversation when she could be respectful, and hung up. Since then, other relatives have been texting me and telling me that I need to be more empathetic to her struggles wih my dad. 

I feel like I was justified, but the family is wearing me down, and the majority say I'm an asshole. So reddit, am I?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I went out last week with a couple friends and everyone got a little hammered. By the end of the night, my bff was acting a bit strange and while we were at a nightclub dancing, she suddenly disappeared. I thought she was with our friend at the bar getting drinks, but she apparently disappeared to be by herself. I went to find her and she said she needed to be alone. She told me she wanted to go home and since she brought our friend, she told me to text her and tell her to meet her at the car. She then disappeared drunk into the night. Worried, I texted our friend and told her to come find me since her ride was back in the car. 

She comes down 5 minutes later disappointed and says ""lets go."" Instead of going back to the car, she heads off to a bar we had been to previously in the night. Apparently our friend has texted her and told her she wasn't actually back at the car, but had gone to the previous bar. Annoyed, we went back to the bar and we literally bump into first friend. She doesn't say anything to me, but grabs second friends hand and literally leaves. I stand there shocked and realize I'm drunk in a bar and waiting on a ride. I text her and say that she literally left me drunk in a bar and no matter how wasted I was, I would never do that to a friend. She texts me back and says ""go home."" I start to cry being a drunk moron and go let someone buy me a drink to drown my sorrows. I find a place to be alone and drink.

My one roommate always talked about getting a dog and whenever the conversation came up I told him that I dont like dogs and would want to talk about it before he got one. In January I took a temporary position across the country but continued to pay rent back home since the position was only for a few months and my rent was cheap.
   A few weeks ago he called me to talk and mentioned he was thinking about getting a dog. My roomate is a great guy but he is so hot and cold about all life decisions that I didn't give this one any mind. I found out today through Facebook that he went and got a puppy and didnt include me in the decision even though I pay rent. I'm worried about the dog chewing on wires to my $2000 computer, xbox, and making a mess of any of my belongings. I also found out that this job will be extended for another year after a 2-4 week break where I will go home. My name is not on the lease and I'm pretty pissed he made this desition without my blessing. WIBTA if I gave him only a week or two notice before moving out when this job starts again and not paying any extra rent to compensate him for the trouble of me leaving early (which was my initial plan)?

byh96u	2019-06-09 05:59:12	ExtraCortex	AITA for posting a bad review about a restaurant?	"So where I live there's this special credit card given to military personnel who serve more than 3 years which provides 30% discount in a lot of restaurants.

One day me and a couple of friends decided to go dine in this fancy restaurant which we knew is acceping the mentioned card(it said so in the cards website). Upon being seated I asked the waitress whether they accept it, and she replied positively. I almost always do it when I go to new restaurants, there have been misunderstandings in the past. Anyway, after a nice meal, when the bill arrived, I gave the card to one of the waiters to pay for everything and couple of minutes later he returned saying that there has been a technical problem for about five days now and they can't accept the card. He said that they are willing to give me 15% discount instead. It seemed unfair to me so I asked him to call his manager. The owner of the restaurant came and said that he is sorry but they don't accept the card at the moment. My argument was that if we knew that they didn't accept the card we would probably order way less, or go to a different restaurant and that I souldn't pay for their problems. The owner got angry and said that it's not his problem that the credit cards site said that his restaurant accepts the card and I told him that I specifically asked the waitress when we arrived and she said they did. At this point he became super pissed and just shouted to one of the waiters to decrease the 15% difference from the waitresses tips and walked away. When a new bill arrived I told them that I don't want that pay cut on my conscience and I'll take the 15% discount and leave.

I don't think that the waitress sould have paid for that mistake even though she was the one who told us that they accepted the card. I am pretty sure that she was not aware of the issue and that's the owners responsibility to notify the staff of such things.
I was so upset at how things turned out and how much of a douche(in my opinion) the owner was that I decided to write a 1-star(out of 5) review on google detailing what happened. About half an hour after I posted the review the owner and a bunch of his friends commented on it calling me a liar, cursing me and telling me to remove it or to never come back again.

My sister said that I shouldn't have posted such a bad review without thinking it through because it can really hurt the business and it's employees. Up until that moment, I thought that that is the reason why google reviews exist, and that what I did was okay, but according to her I was the asshole, so I took the reivew down.

byh7b2	2019-06-09 05:51:02	Keaston_Stang	AITA for texting my bosses wife?	"Here’s a quick rundown..

Boss invited my girlfriend and I to stay in their cabin for the weekend, with him and his wife. 

(My boss) 
He parked his truck in the neighbors driveway. 
When he left with his wife for lunch, the neighbor came up to the cabin and caused a commotion about the truck being parked in his driveway. 

I told him I would move it, but I needed my bosses permission.  

I tried to call my boss, but had no signal. I texted him, 3 times. No response. (10 mins later.... neighbor is angry)

I decided to text his wife. She typically responds quick. 

“Hey, your neighbor is a little upset about the truck being in his driveway- can I move it for you? Just needed to ask you guys.” Is what I texted her. 


My boss calls me with a HUGE attitude and tells me that I NEVER text his wife regarding his business. And that this is my first and last warning. 

I was speechless. I apologized. He has NEVER acted like that before. ( I thought maybe the wife chewed him out?)

(I just wanted permission to move the truck)

When they got back- his wife was fine! She apologized to me for having to move the truck— and here’s the thing... she didn’t even yell at my boss or anything... she said she was just upset I had to do that.

Am I the asshole? I kinda felt like I undermined him at first but she was okay all in all....?

*Edit: sorry for the misleading title. This isn’t an affair related post, I apologize for my non-clarifications.

**edit: thank you all for your answers and advice. You’ve really helped me figure things out here. I’m gonna begin a job search (just in case things go south) and I’m gonna talk to my boss 1 on 1. Ask him why things went down the way they did, and try to separate my friendship from work with him. Wish me luck fiends. Keep on giving advice too! I could use it. And I’m thankful for you.


UPDATE:

I talked to my boss. Here’s how it went;

I asked him “I wanted to apologize for the truck issue this past weekend again. It’s been weighing on my mind a bit and I needed a little closure on something”

He says “Okay, on what?”

I reply “I’ll be honest, sir, I didn’t see this weekend as anything related to our professional relationship. I saw it as a friendship trip- unrelated to work. When approached by your neighbor, I felt it very necessary to contact you before he damaged or had the truck towed. Seeing as how I called a few times, and sent some texts... I thought the best way to get to you quickly may have been through (wife’s name). Again I didn’t mean to undermine you in any way.. I just needed permission to move the truck.. and I truly felt like there was a misunderstanding in the way both of us may have handled it.”

He says “I do not leave my ringer on, so I accept responsibility for that part. And I apologize to you. I was a little frustrated with the neighbor when I heard this news, and I also released some of that anger with you when you messaged my wife. I apologize for that as well. You did the only things that you could to help me out, and I completely disrespected you. It was a friendly-relationship Trip, and I acted as your boss... even more so, I was a bad one with unjust actions. I’m sorry, and I will improve my attitudes towards you.”


I feel as if he covered a good portion of my concerns, and he took ownership. It went really well. I’m still discreetly looking for work, but at a less serious pace. 

NOTE: I have learned my lesson and will not be attending a vacation with a boss ever again, and will keep it limited to a friendly dinner every now and then. 

Thank you all for your advice and support. Finding the words to say wouldn’t be possible without some of you. I’m grateful."	Not the A-hole	0	0	485.0	92.0	0.0	0.0

I recently realized that my friend who has an Etsy shop for custom, hand drawn pet photographs and house portraits has been tracing her reference photos almost entirely. I know that some people do not view tracing as cheating sometimes when it doesn’t involve ripping off another person’s art, but I guess it seems like it raises a moral dilemma when people do it and charge portrait prices for tracing the reference photo. 

I suppose I’m less angry than I am just upset that I’ve been lied to a little bit about this, but part of me wonders if I’m being irrational and this is something that other people may think is okay for artists to do. Especially since I suppose she does put a stylistic spin on it, but it kind of seems like that spin in this situation is just choosing to be lazy with drawing the tiger’s fur.

Anyways she has two sisters, both of which are really selfish..in fact her whole family is. 

Yesterday, I was asked to pick Cassie’s sister up we’ll call her Ellie. She was going to go out to bars about 30-40 mins away from where we live. I was asked to go pick her up at about 1130 because then she wouldn’t be getting home on her own so I agreed.

byh2cr	2019-06-09 05:31:31	schaweniiia	AITA for inviting my 13yo nephew to visit me abroad, but not his mum?	"**Background**: I (26f, moved abroad years ago) have a difficult relationship with my sisters. We had very turbulent teenage years and their hyper melodramatic personalities make it impossible to spend more than one afternoon with them without yelling. I admit, I usually take the bait and can't stop arguing with them, either. But I've realized I only get so upset with them while my life is otherwise pretty drama-free and I enjoy it. That, and a very unpleasant visit home early last year, caused me to let them know that wherever I end up long-term, I don't want close contact.

That is complicated by the fact that my older sister has two sons that she got as a teenager. Especially the older one, my godchild, is very close to me, something that was one of her favourite drama topics. She never liked it, but since we all lived together for a while, it just was like that.

**Situation**: I'll visit my in-laws next year who live in a neighboring country to my own home country and my mum will visit me there for a week and stay in their only guestroom. She suggested taking my nephew because he had a tough time with me leaving and I thought it would be cool showing him around a new country for no money since he could stay in a room with my mum and has never been abroad before.

I approached my sister, saying it would be fine if she said no, I'd understand. She told my nephew happily that he's going to come... With her, my other nephew and her boyfriend.

I had an issue with this because 1) the conditions were clearly communicated, she didn't ask me if this is okay, but instead just told everyone and expects my in-laws to cater to all of them and 2) I don't want her there because I told her I want little contact and I want absolutely NO contact between her and my in-laws as I'm frankly a bit embarrassed about her and my other sister and their constant drama. They behaved poorly in front of past in-laws and my current partner, so I'll never make that mistake again. I just thought it was a neat idea to see my nephew.

In the ensuing fight, I told her as much, she had an absolute meltdown and we're now on a no contact basis. Obviously, my nephew will not come.

I feel a bit bad now, I've hurt her. But I also feel like I would been taken advantage of here and that feels unfair. Am I the asshole here? Should I stay away from my nephew because I don't get along with her? I feel a bit lost.

So I found this nice Desley carry-on that my grandmother bought for me to use on this trip, and I kept it at her house as I live in a fairly small apartment. Then, today, I called her about borrowing a large suitcase, to check, as she has more suitcases than people to use them, and she told me that, not only, did I not need a checked bag, but that she would the carry-on that she bought for me to use on this trip. I talked to my sister about this and she said that it didn’t matter because she had bought it, and I would just like to know who is right in this situation.	Not the A-hole	0	0	316.0	17.0	0.0	0.0
byh0gs	2019-06-09 05:24:19	intoner1	AITA for wanting to go to disney world next year?	"Okay so I know this title sounds very first world problem but please hear me out. I (19f) went to disney world this year and fell in love, when leaving I made the decision that I want to go back. Now if that’ll be with a friend or by myself I don’t know but I do know I’m definitely going back, so since I’m working this summer I made a plan to save 70% of each paycheck to go towards the trip and everything. I’ve been talking to my family about it and extremely excited but my dad isn’t very happy over it.  But today it all came to a head.

I was talking about planning it and stuff and my dad suddenly says I can’t go. I ask why and he says I need to help pay for my books for school instead of “wasting my money.” Now, I understand this but I don’t see why I can’t save for my trip AND help pay for my schooling. If I have a job I’ll be able to do both, plus I have scholarships that cover the vast majority of my costs. 

I don’t have an issue with paying for my schooling, last year I spent upwards of 500 dollars on buying things for my dorm and such. I did rely on my parents for money during the school year, however because I wasn’t allowed to get a job. But this year will be different since I’ll be allowed to work and I will buy my own food and groceries and such. But anyways things came to a head when my dad said something that made me angry.

He said, “you’re not going to be wasting OUR money on a trip to Disney world.” That comment upset me greatly because how is it “our” money? If I’m the one working it’s my money, is he the one dealing with a three year olds temper tantrums in tandem with her newborn brothers incessant crying 15 hours a week? Is he going to be the one taking a job and dealing with studies when school starts? I did yell (which I regret) “how is it your money if I’m the one working?” And he immediately shut down and said, “I’m not going to talk to you if you’re going to disrespect me.” 

This resulted in a screaming match between him and my mom where he got mad at her for “not respecting him.” I went to my room in tears and now I feel like shit. Later my mom came to my room and explained their expectations on how I should contribute to my schooling but stated that as long as I’m doing that I can do whatever I want with the rest of my money. It’s completely understandable and again I don’t mind having to help pay, I just don’t understand why I would be barred from going on a trip if I’m meeting the rest of my responsibilities. So AITA?"

byh015	2019-06-09 05:22:37	CharmingFill	AITA for refusing to pay for dates at restaurants I don't like?	"About 2 years ago I decided I would no longer eat at restaurants that didn't pay their employees a livable wage and made them rely on tips.  I'll still go to restaurants that pay the $2.50 per hour or whatever for social obligations, but I won't order any food.  I'll order a drink or two, and still tip accordingly.  No one has really ever noticed, and those that do have never cared.  I started dating Brenda 5 weeks ago, and we've been on 3 dates at restaurants (10 dates total).

&#x200B;

We have 2 restaurants in town that are ""tip-less"" or ""tip-free"" (lets call them BBQ and MEX).  They both have great food, great service, competitive prices, but most importantly they pay their employees good wages and offer their Full-Timers benefits.  I want to support restaurants (and really all businesses) that think like this, so thats where I choose to spend my money at.  

&#x200B;

On our first restaurant date, Brenda and I ate at MEX.  Our 2nd, we went to BBQ.  Our 3rd, back at MEX.  When she asked me last night if I wanted to go out to eat at a restaurant, I said sure.  We got in the car and I asked if she wanna hit up BBQ?  She said no, actually, she wanted to try out this Japanese restaurant.  One of my friends was a chef there a few years back and always complained about the shitty owners and the wait staff being stingy/lying with splitting the tips.  I said sure, but I asked if she would pay.  She said I guess, unenthusiastic.  She got quiet for a few seconds then said, ""So when I want to pick the restaurant I have to pay for the date?""  I explained thats not the case at all.  I don't like supporting restaurants that dont support their employees and force people to tip.  I went into a few of my reasons why.  I told her I'd be happy to pay at BBQ or MEX (note, I've paid for all 10 of our dates so far, so I don't feel bad asking her to pay for 1 dinner) or I'd go with her to Japanese restaurant, but wont order food.  I'll just order a drink and enjoy her company.  Those options were unacceptable, as she wanted to eat at Japanese and didn't wanna be the only one eating.  So we went and she paid, begrudgingly, then asked me to take her back home (usually she stays over my house when we go out).  

&#x200B;

Today, she calls me and tells me that she likes trying out new restaurants, and if she will always have to pay just because I don't want to tip?  I said if its an unavoidable situation then I would still pay, but if a tip-free option were available I will only spend my money there.  She said spoke to her friends about everything and they all agree that my position is a red flag.  I'm either cheap or controlling.  I didn't know how to respond.

I feel like my mom have distanced herself from me ever since I turned 18, at first I understood because I was becoming an adult and needed to be independent. But, sometimes I want to hang out with her and talk about my day and all of that. Basically, a “mother and child time” or whatever is called. As a child, we used to hang out more. She would be with me, watch movies, play, teach me new things, and now I rarely see her, even though I still live with her and dad. I don’t see her often because I go to college and she because she has stuff to do. (She works at home and manages the household whenever there’s an issue like maintenance, and I help when I can) also she picks my sister up from school. We are both busy to be honest. But what I’ve seen, is that she prioritize my sister more. She’s 15 and well she gets to be with mom more.  

I remember inviting her to a fashion runway with local fashion designers, it was a beautiful event and I wanted to do something with my mom, so she could distract herself from work. But she said no because my sister wanted to go for an ice cream with her friends and my mom ended up being their driver even though she complained. I ended up going alone. I thought about inviting my dad but he is a very busy lawyer who goes to a lot of meetings and told me he didn’t like those kind of things. I felt sad and angry with my mom because I told her about the runway two weeks before and she agreed to go and I remember I was super excited. She came up with “why don’t you invite your friends?” 

I don’t have many friends... 

Only 4 and from those 4 there is only one closer to me, but she’s out of the country. 

Whenever I want to talk with her, she rarely pays attention to me or is distracted with her phone. I just feel like she isn’t taking me seriously. I talked about what I feel about her behavior towards me but she told me I was an asshole for being “too demanding” and that I should be grateful. I don’t understand...I miss her company and now I feel bad now. Like, yeah I get I’m 20 but I love my mom with all my life and I miss her company, things aren’t like before and I get that, but is it wrong?

My current partner used to have a huge crush on one of my close friends before we started seeing each other. He didn't share the same feelings and wasn't kind in how he rejected her. She's moved on since then but he still feels guilty about his actions.

Now onto current events

My friend is turning 18 and has invited all of our friend group (mostly male) to a party to celebrate. He has said +1's are allowed as long as we ask him first. Normally when this happens everyone +1's their partner and I wanted to do the same. 

So, I asked my partner if she wanted to go with me and she was very excited and wants to come. I asked my friends permission to bring a +1 and who I'd be bringing. He said if she is coming because of me then it's fine but if she is using me to get back to him he doesn't want her there.

My partner claims she's moved on and I trust her but I'm worried my friend is only saying what he did to make me happy (He does this a lot as he is very submissive) and I feel like I've thrown him aside in this situation. My partner being there could potentially ruin his 18th and I don't want that but at the same time he said it would be ok and she has moved on.

bygy04	2019-06-09 05:15:00	petrolbutler	AITA Fiancé accused me of punishing her by punishing my son... I don’t know what to think anymore.	"So some backstory of our situation. I have been home from work with my 3 year old son for about 2 weeks for some mental health issues. I’ve been seeing a therapist that tells me to be consistent with our son in his discipline and support things my fiancé says she needs help with to reduce my anxiety. 

Today was all about playtime while mom has been at work til about 2pm. She gets home and I’m grateful so that she can play with our son so I can get some things done uninterrupted. Instead she just takes a nap... for three hours. Disappointed, I continued to entertain him. 

Our neighbors brought their kids over and they were playing well and I could finally focus on my to do list. NOPE. My fiancé comes out and says “we’re done playing kiddo, gotta go to the movies!” He started crying and then she states “We’re going inside no matter what. You can listen, go inside and go to the movies or...  throw a tantrum, go inside, and stay home.” 

At this point he’s hitting and in full 3 year old meltdown. This continues until the time we were supposed to leave has passed. I tell him that he lost the movies for hitting mom, the time has passed and you missed it, but he can continue playing with his friend. My fiancé then blamed me for ruining her night even though she told him staying home would be the punishment. I followed through and tried to support her by listening and staying consistent. Now I’m called the asshole. 

In that time, me and my son went on a walk, had bath time, and put him to sleep with Toy Story, all of which she could have accompanied us in. I don’t know what to think of this or of myself. Am I the asshole partner ruining her life or am I trying to do the right thing for my son? Or is my perception fucked up somewhere?

I'm 14 and my dad owns a company, I usually try and help in the office. Last time, I finished a bit early, had nothing to do, so went on my phone like any normal person (I'm in an office, what else is there, not even internet for more than 2 PCs) and he got mad at me and i was forced home. now , he won't accept  help. Whatever, that's not my fault and I'm confused anyway.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, he mentioned that he had a friend coming to the office to elp him with social media influencing and accounts and SEO, all that stuff. My mom told me to go and I said sure, we won't be there until past 3 anyway. I was told 'You might get KFC', so then I realised it's around lunchtime. I'm cool with that. So today I went to the office to help him, and to listen to the friend. Now, I have an advert I made 2 years ago for them that they want shortened, so I agreed. It's a 30-45 minute job at worst.

I got to the office, got out my computer and started studying, cause I know his friend is coming at lunch time. then I get asked what I'm doing, and i say studying. He gets mad cause I'm not doing the advert which I was told about YESTERDAY; he mentioned it before, said they'll use new pictures and never sent me them. He asked why, and I said 'because I didn't bring my Mac', because if we're there (until 130, from 8 when we get there, even if I help him doing basic accounting (45 min) and filing (30 min) plus the video(45 min) it's 1000. Obviously I'm gonna have to listen, from let's say 1230. I decided to take my computer with my notes for exams etcetera (school laptop, my own) because I have nothing that I can do on my Mac, I don't even have study resources or books on it.

&#x200B;

My question is, AITA for not bringing the Mac to do his thing when I figured we'd be home by 2, or 215 latest, which gives me more than enough time to do his advert?

&#x200B;

I have tried for as long as we have had children to communicate to this guy in every conceivable format the things our kids are up to such as appointments, lessons, etc, and nothing works.  I have tried calling him and discussing it - he calls me back and says he was acting like he was listening but wasn't really and I can't expect him to answer calls and listen to me.  I have left voice messages - he deletes them.  I have texted him, he looses the texts.  I have forwarded on the emails from the groups and he doesn't like reading them.  I have set up calendar appointments and he doesn't look at them, and tells the kids I did it wrong.  I asked him sit down with me and so he can put the events into his own calendar, he did sit down with me and asked a million questions I thought we were settled and at the end he then told me to login to the calendar and double check everything, I didn't - because I got busy with the actual children and he screwed up the events and then blamed me because I didn't double check HIS calendar.  

He keeps missing the kids functions, doesn't support them in their events then blames me to the kids and everyone else.  

I figure that he is looking for a free secretary he can blame for his screw ups, and since I am no longer his wife, I don't have to be his secretary or blame person he can control.

 All the other parents, as well as myself read the emails and get the data we need and manage our lives without someone setting it all up for us.  

It is in the divorce decree that I share what is going on, and I do, but it doesn't say I need to maintain his calendar, so I don't.

When I was heading home, I texted him seeing if he wanted to do something around 10:00PM. He answered right away and said he would head over.

Within the 10 minutes that it took him to head over, apparently I passed out at the kitchen table. He arrived and texted me 4 times , staying for nearly 30 minutes to make sure I wasn’t just away from my phone.

bygrt7	2019-06-09 04:52:18	a_lam5	AITA for snapping at a man at the dog park who was ignoring his dog’s incessant humping of my dog?	"There’s nothing I can do about it now as I’ll probably (hopefully) never see him again, but  I have a problem with ruminating so I’m going to be thinking about the incident a lot. 

Basically I brought my dog to our usual dog park today, and there was an unusual amount of humping going on between many of the male dogs. My dog wasn’t participating but was the target of one dog in particular. For over 15 minutes, this far larger dog chased mine around, mounting him with his weight so that my dog couldn’t get away. 

At one point, my dog was getting mounted directly next to the other dog’s owner, and I mean within arms reach to him. Despite my dog crying and not being able to get away (my dog is about 50lbs and ~1 yr old, this dog was likely a bit older and had to have weighed at least ~120lbs), his owner simply watched it happen and didn’t make any attempt to remove his dog from mine or verbally accost him in any way. He simply watched. 

After about 20 minutes of watching this dog follow my dog around at the heels and telling myself “He’ll eventually leave him alone” and “The owner will step in one of these times,” the other owner kept looking the other way. 

I eventually caught up to the dogs and physically removed his dog from mine, but the dog was relentless. I looked up and the owner was standing a few yards away on his phone. I yelled “Can you do something about your dog!?” and he slowly walked over just saying his dog’s name and saying “Sorry about that.”

I ended up going off on this guy a little bit, telling him my dog is going to get hurt and he needs to keep a better eye on his. He went on saying “dogs will be dogs,” and “maybe the timid park would be better for you,” which just made me angrier. 

He ended up leaving, which I did not ask him to do. I simply said he should be more present with his dog. He made a total scene as he put his dog in his car, etc. Shortly after most people at the park left, probably because I made them uncomfortable. 

I know that I was in the wrong with taking it so far, but am I the asshole for getting upset about his intentional ignorance? He was watching his dog harass mine and chose to turn a blind eye. That blatant disregard for his dog’s behavior is what set me off, and he didn’t seem to think there was anything wrong with it.

She was and still is incredibly mean and abusive. She would throw out my belongings as a kid just because ""they were ugly"" shaved my head when I was trying to grow out my hair because ""I looked gay"", would scream and cuss on a daily basis, and tried to kill me... 

I tried to reconnect with her now that I'm an adult and things hadn't changed with her one bit. Still screaming, still Cussing, still hitting and questioning my sexuality... Cutting contact with her is obvious. But I'm thinking of doing the same thing with my dad because he was there for the whole thing. 

He would sit back and watch her leave me a bloody and bruised mess and if she asked him to join he would apologize but join in regardless. There's zero doubt he knew most everything and never done anything except tell me to ""wait it out"" or ""be patient"" that everything would be okay soon, ask if I was okay and leave for a few hours with me until things calmed down... I'm 22 and moved out now. I thought maybe things would be better and I was bombed by my friends saying things like I only have one mom... But today I tried to visit and no one opened the door. When I called she asked ""what the fuck I wanted"" and cussed me again. When I didn't leave fast enough she let her dog who hates me outside forcing me to give up.

No call or text from my dad, no asking what happened or anything so I called him only to hear ""she's just in a bad mood try again in the morning"" the problem... I don't want to try again only to be yelled at and insulted and I no longer even want to be around him for enabling this.

 I'll happily reconnect if he leaves her but until then it's no longer worth it to me. I feel like he picked her over me and.. It hurts. So I'm done with them both. I acknowledge he's a victim too. But he's a victim who has ways out and isn't taking them. We could have had a much better life, we could have both been happier and healthier if he would have gotten us out. Instead all he does is wait and take the bullshit. And I feel it's time I leave them both behind... I can't even text him because he tells her everything otherwise she searches HIS phone and picks fights with him.

Well, I have credit card bills due so I waited and messaged her in May asking if she could Venmo me my money and she said that she couldn’t even make rent that month so there was nothing she could do, but that I’d be the first to get paid when she can. Well, it’s June now and she still hasn’t paid me. If she really was just super tight on money, I’d understand. BUT I see her Snapchat stories and she goes out several nights a week, she’s constantly shopping for random things for herself like hats or books or clothes or whatever she thinks is cute that day. I know she easily could have saved up $200 to give me by now based on how much money she must have spent just going out regularly these past couple months. I know it’s her choice how she spends her money but... it’s really irritating at this point because I feel like she’s lying to me about being able to pay me back. I don’t want to ruin our friendship over $200, but I also have bills to pay and do need my money. Would I be the asshole if I mention this to her?	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

In the divorce, the judge decided that the cat would go back and forth with the kids. Since my kids were young, it was my job to care for the cat when they were at my house, which was 90% of the time. As they got older, I nagged and nagged them to feed the cat and change the litter box but that ended up being even more work than just doing it myself. My kids also would say that dad never made them feed or clean up after the cat when they were with him, which was utterly frustrating because he was caring for the cat (and our kids) one weekend a month at most and I was doing the rest.

The cat has passed and it was sad, but my kids are 15 and 17 now so it’s not a tragedy, especially since she was quite old. Lo and behold, my ex shows up at my house with a new cat! I said hell no to the cat, and told my ex that he had better own up to the kids on why we couldn’t keep the cat, because I was not going to be blamed for this cat being taken away nor will I bad mouth my ex to my kids and blame this on him myself. I do NOT want a new cat. This is a huge responsibility, and my kids are moving out in the next few years anyway. This cat is only 2. That’s like 10 more years of this commitment that I do not want, and I sure as shit know my ex won’t take care of it when my kids move out, and I’ll have to be the bitch that gave the cat away. At the moment, the cat is staying with my ex, and I told him that it either stays at his place or gets rehomed, because I’m not taking care of it. I offered to help my ex find a new owner, which I think is more than generous. My kids are pissed at me as it is for not taking the cat and taking care of it.

byglj3	2019-06-09 04:30:08	kwared	AITA for ghosting my friend who has developed mental health issues and abusive behavior	"I have known that friend for nearly two decades. Our paths have parted and we live far away from each other, but until now we kept in contact and called each other quite often.

&#x200B;

Several years ago she started developing mental health issues, and also became very abusive and manipulative. It was our common friends and families who noticed and called it out first. Most of them just called her crazy and stopped talking to her. Her boyfriend broke up with her for that exact reason and we all know it. I tried to be a good friend and support her as much as I could, but our relationship and phone calls became very one-sided.

&#x200B;

After a long time being away, she came to visit me this spring and I realized that things are way worse than I even thought. I am not an expert but I can see clear signs of borderline personality, swings in mood, crying a lot (very often over very small things). At the same time, she is very manipulative and showing abusive behavior, joking (or not?) about cutting herself, and often just being rude and saying things that really hurt to hear.

&#x200B;

Long story short: I ghosted her. I am not picking up her calls, I text her back sometimes that I am very busy at work (which is true), but I do not see our relationship as friendship anymore. I do not want to hurt her (I am one of a few friends she has left) but I am not interested in hearing her whining and things about me that I would never tolerate in any other situation.

Dated/engaged for 3 years before so it's not a new relationship. She's currently on deployment. We have 2 cars, my mustang and her jeep. I was using her jeep to drive for uber and wrecked it. Sucks, but it's fully insured so we can replace the car pretty easily. None of that was an issue, she was just glad that I wasn't hurt in the wreck.
Two weeks later we get the check from the insurance company so I can buy a replacement SUV. We were on the same page about replacing it with a new Jeep Compass. After I find out the Compass with all the features she wants in the car is out of our price range I tell her I'm gonna look at a Mazda CX-5. After some substantial car shopping I find a slightly used one with all the features she wanted. Or so I thought. I had sent her the link of the car I was going to test drive and she initially said she liked it. The last thing I was gonna ask her was if FWD was okay instead of a 4 wheel drive. Her internet gets cut off frequently, so she lost it before she could respond to my last minute question. The next day I go ahead and buy the car. It's great. Got a really good deal on it and I'm stoked because i think she might like it more than the jeep. Later that day she gets internet back. She freaks out that it does not have 4 wheel drive and is pissed that I bought it. She says she will not like this car and wants me to return the car. I don't want to do this. I offer her a compromise. I'll keep the car and drive it for UBER until she gets back, she can test drive it then and if she doesn't like it we will trade it in for an SUV that she does like. She refuses. She is unwilling to accept any scenario that doesn't involve me returning the CX-5. This upset me and I've told her that I refuse to return the car until she gets back.

The next morning she texts me and says “Just bought tickets for the concert for me and teenage daughter!”

I feel like it was a little ignorant of her to a) not reach out to be about tagging along and  b)if not that, maybe just not message me about it? And ever since then she’s been posting on Instagram every day about how pumped she is (when she hadn’t even heard of said artist last week.)

-DAD: It's been proven recently that people who have multiple hobbies and interests, and diversify their experiences are near the top in their field. You guys are on the right path, you-

MOM: Yeah, but doesn't everyone know that? When *I* was growing up, my family always told me to do a lot of things, and try new things. Everyone knows this already! It's nothing new.

DAD: That's true. It's just that the world has become oriented towards becoming good at one thing instead of widening your horizons.

MOM: Yeah, but everyone knows that already. Everyone has always told me the same thing. It's nothing new. You're saying it like it's exciting and groundbreaking, but it's not. -

This was immediately followed by her continuing to get more inflamed and upset, and trying to prove her point even when we had stopped. Everyone else got bored and anxious to just keep watching the movie. She then noticed and said that we were ""trying to stop her from asking questions and voicing her opinion"" and told us that we were disappointing because we weren't agreeing with her. She turned to me and we argued too.

MOM: I've sacrificed so much for you all, and for what? Don't be afraid to ask questions or be honest even if it upsets me. Tell me the truth. Why didn't you want me asking questions?!

ME: The truth is, we just wanted to get back to the movie. Nothing else. You made your point, but it feels like you're always trying to win when it's not even an argument.
MOM: You really can't even understand can you?!

ME: Oh, I think I do.

The aforementioned friend sent me a text today asking if I'd like to go to a music festival (sounds like MonAchoo) on Saturday and Sunday of next week. He has an extra ticket for those nights, and we live close by (<5 hours away). I've never been to a music festival before because I know I'm the type of person to get agitated from not being able to shower, not being able to pee at will, and my fickle relationship with large crowds. Yes, I'm a real delight! However, in this situation, we have VIP passes--place to stay/get away with AC and showers. I was ecstatic to receive the invite.
     I broached the subject with my wife this evening, and she was...apoplectic. She is steadfastly against me going as I will be ""doing drugs around girls."" Confession--I am a recreational smoker (as is my wife) and also like to partake in more exotic things from time to time (Molly, mushrooms, and very rarely--Peruvian Marching Powder). I have never cheated on a girlfriend and I'm not starting with my wife. Nonetheless, she is convinced that I--in 2 days away from her--will devolve willy nilly into drug fueled orgies with anyone having an ""innie.""
    I didn't take her response well. There were lots of harsh words exchanged. I told her that she obviously thought I was untrustworthy, and that any doubts I had about going were gone now on a matter of principle. To wit, ""You bet your fucking ass I'm going now just because you're being an asshole."" I told my friend I was in...and my wife has spent the entire evening crying in the bedroom. Obviously, we are not speaking.

"My boyfriend and I have only been together a little over 3 months. Things have been going well, we had some misunderstandings but overall we're both happy! The thing is, my cats have always been extremely important to me and they have been here far longer than he has. I dont feel like I should stop what I've always been doing, especially when it would both distress me and my cats (They are very dependent on me so it's definitely not ""just cats"".) I gave in to his demand the other night, and I say demand because he got mad at me when I tried to keep them with us, as in actually scolding me and threatening to go sleep at his place. I wasn't happy but I was tired so I just went to bed after cuddling them and closing the door.  


The next day I talked to him about it and I told him, next time if he wants to sleep properly he will have to use the guest bedroom so that way, I get to sleep with my cats and everyone is happy! It's not like we share my bed anyway, its way too small and he already has to bring one into my room.  


Some people would say that relationships require sacrifices, and I do make them. But this isn't something I feel I should have to compromise at all when it's my home, my pets. I'm extremely fond of animals whereas he's like ""Meh. It's a cat/dog"". He has tried to say I don't take good care of him only because of this one thing I refuse to do, and has also admitted to being jealous of the attention I give my cats. It's true that I spend more time with them than the average person, but I'm no crazy cat lady either. They're part of my life and I think he should respect that.
