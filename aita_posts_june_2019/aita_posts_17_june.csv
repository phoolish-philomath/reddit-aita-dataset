c1xfnv	2019-06-18 03:54:38	shawnruk	AITA If I refuse to go to my step-grandmother's funeral.	"I know step-grandmother really isn't something people say. However, she is my mom's father second wife. She is not the women who gave birth to my mother but was married to my grandfather before I was born. I did call her grandma while growing up.  

I want to start off by saying my family is simple small town minded people. I don't think they are intentionally racist or bigoted, but rather a product of their upbringing. Maybe, I hold it against them.

My grandma died today. I don't feel anything about it. I am not sad, nor do I want to go to the funeral. I haven't had a real conversation with her for 20 years. My family says I must attend her funeral and I am not going to.

I am gay to start off. My mother and step-father are born again Christians (nothing bad about that). However, my mom was ok with me being gay when I came out at 17. However, she had an affair and she and my step-father came back together with the help of their religion and church. Since then, she has not been ok with me being gay. I have distance my self from her and have not seen her in 10+ years. The final straw was when I was with my boyfriend of 6 years and she said in front of us, ""How do I know I won't like girls if I have never been with one?""  I cut ties.

I came out when I was 17. My mom was cool with it then (pre born again Christian). However, my grandpa and grandma were not ok with it and ask my mom, if I need to be baptized or if they needed to interview. At 17, I decided to distance myself from them.  It is the whole, leave them before they can quit my idea.

So grandpa died when I was 18. I went to the funeral as I was in high school.  I am 37 now, I don't want to see my family--my mom makes me sad when I talk to her and none of my stepfamilies actually likes me. 

However, I have grown up with guilt my whole life. It is instilled in me that is is always my fault. My Mom says if I love her, I'll go and support her. I don't want to, but I feel guilty.  I'm the asshole for being selfish. Going to see my family, will set me back and hurt me. Maybe this doesn't make sense to you. If you have questions, please send me a message."

c1xfmb	2019-06-18 03:54:29		AITA if I dislike my brothers girlfriend.	"My brother (23) started dating his girlfriend about two years ago. 
Ever since she became his girlfriend she’s always put unrealistic expectations on me to behave a certain way.
For example; my brother was being an asshole to my extended family (who he lives with) and I called him out on it saying “idc if you have a girlfriend but you need to respect those doing so much for you and spend time with them.” She got upset and started saying I disrespected her. I apologised to her even though I wasn’t talking exclusively about her but just my brothers behaviour to his family.  
Then on my 21st birthday a couple of months ago; I had my extended family, my brother and his girlfriend visiting for the weekend. I ended up doing her make up and getting her ready for my birthday dinner. And then her and my brother were really upset the whole dinner because they weren’t sat beside each other and instead opposite each other. She was also upset because she was on a diet and the food had carbs. It was a set degustation menu which my parents had already paid for. The whole weekend was horrible. 
Recently, our relationship has definitely improved and we try keep in touch here and there. My parents like her and I can tell my brother loves her. They FaceTime the both of them together every week and my dad really likes her as well. 

But I still find her overly controlling towards him and discuss this with my cousins a lot. We don’t think he is how he used to be. He’s a lot more closed off and when ever my friends visit he refrains from talking to them. Recently he unfollowed my best friend (who he’s known for 10 years) on instagram for no reason. He tries to convince me not to have my friends over when I call them. I can’t joke with him about anything because it always comes back to his girlfriend and I feel like he judges me for dating people and not being in a committed relationship. My two cousins (who live  with him) and I are all the same age and we have a group chat where we kind of talk shit. If she does something we usually mention it in the chat and have a laugh. I feel like a bit of an asshole for talking shit even though I know he’s happy but I can’t shake off my doubts about her.  

Am I the asshole for talking to my cousins about her? Does it make the asshole in my brothers life  for not liking her?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So basically some friends sometimes bring up theories about how governments lie to us about every single thing. For example :

They control weather without us knowing,
Moon and sun are not real, or not what we think they are,
The earth isn't flat (obviously) but it isn't round either,

And there are plenty of other stuff they keep bringing up and every time I destroy them with facts and pure logic and every time the conversation just ends up cringy and just uncomfortable in itself. 

Is it me who should just shut up or are they lost and I should bring them back to the real world ?

Edit : They are not joking. These theories they believe are completely serious, I can tell.
And I don't do this for fun, I just can't help myself.

c1xcxl	2019-06-18 03:46:03		AITA For trying to reach out to someone even if I (20F) wasn't sure if they wanted me to?	"Throwaway because I want to be able to delete it fast in case she sees it, because even after everything I really don't want to hurt her

**TL;DR - A ""friend"" of mine blocked me on social media platforms after I tried to reach out a few times after she promised me an explanation for hurting me for the past month. AITA for reaching out even if I felt like sometimes she didn't want me to?**

I had this friend during the school year and I developed feelings for her in the short amount of time I knew her. I knew she had just broken it off with her partner of a few months, and with some pushing from a friend, I told her I had feelings for her but I understood it was bad timing and I was fine with staying friends. She told me it *was* bad timing, but that she was glad I had told her and that we could stay friends

We promised to stay in contact over the summer but that fell through. I was hurt but let it go since I knew she and her partner were getting back together and I didn’t want to cause a rift

So I texted her about two weeks ago and tell her that I haven’t heard from her lately and that I hope she’s having a good. She messages me and asks me to lie about my feelings if she texted me that night

I was hurt by that I wrote her a letter and emailed it to her since I didn’t know how to get it to her without her partner seeing it. She messaged me the next day telling me that she had been lying to her partner and promised me an explanation 

I sent her a message telling her how she can get ahold of me since I’m not in the states atm. She doesn’t respond, so I send her another a couple days later checking in

Here’s where the potential AITA comes in

(This all took place over 17 days)

She still hadn’t responded and I felt so lost in this whole situation. I sent her another email asking if she was ever going to reach out, since she had promised me an explanation

I never got a response and just kept hoping maybe she hadn’t seen it. But she seemed so sorry when I told her I was upset and she told me she wanted to make everything right, and the person I got to know wouldn’t just ignore someone hurting like this

But then I saw her active on Instagram and asked if everything was okay. She didn’t answer and I eventually sent her an email apologizing for all of the messages. I said goodbye for real this time

I was always careful not to hurt her through my messages, as I just wanted a fucking explanation, and not to hurt her

I also made it clear in that I wanted to clear up the issues with our friendship, because I understand that she’s in a relationship. I even told her in one of them that she didn’t have to worry about the feelings anymore because I no longer felt that way

That was and will be the last message

Today on Instagram I noticed I had been blocked. She also blocked me on Facebook

c1xci7	2019-06-18 03:44:48		AITA for calling my BIL an entitled oversize baby?	"Backstory.... I am 17 y/o going on 18, my BIL, Rick is 35 y/o. Rick is a welder that travels across the country for work. About a month ago he came back to my home town for a project that will take a few months to complete.

When Rick arrive, my parents did what any good in-law would do, help him get settled in. Gave him pots and pans, utensils,  cleaning supplies, bed sheets etc.  

For the first week or so, my parents invited him for dinner. As it was responsibility to cook dinner for my family, I was fine with cooking extras for Rick since it wasn't that much extra work. And my parents who paid for the groceries never expected anything back from him.

Anyway, he settled in to his own place, live went back to normal. We did our own stuff and Rick did his own stuff. Or at least that's what we thought. 

One night, my dad received an angry phone call from my sister. She yelled at my dad saying how selfish we are. Scolded my dad  for not inviting her husband over for dinner anymore. That was blatantly untrue since we invited Rick out for dinner that weekend and my parents paid for eveything including Rick's meal.

As it turns out, Rick was expecting that my parents would continue providing meals for him for free and also expecting me to cook dinner for him. He actually told my sister that we left him out of dinner while he came to visit us.

The event that he was talking about was on the one day he dropped in uninvited. Not expecting a guest, I cooked enough food for 3 people. As we were just finishing our dinner, the door bell rang, and it was none other than Rick at the door. Dad told him we were just finishing dinner and if he needed anything. He just said he came over to visit, drank a beer from the fridge and left half an hour later.

Anyway, when I heard about what happened, I was got really really mad and offended. Rick thinks that he's entitled to free meals and have someone cook it for him.

I texted Rick right away and told him that he was an immature oversized baby. Told him that his entitled @$$ isn't welcomed at our house any longer. I was sick of him being a freeloader.

Well, yea. So now my sister is mad at me. She thinks I'm rude for disrespecting my elders. Entitiled brother in law wrote a passive aggressive Facebook status about how family should support one another and Gen Z not knowing manners.

Tldr: Called my brother in law an immature oversized baby because he felt entitled to be a freeloader."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Context: driving home and I come up on the back of a tow truck that was towing an RV.  On the back of the broken down RV was a bicycle that was being dragged on the ground.  We were going about 65 miles per hour but only the bikes back tire was really hitting the ground. 

There was a number on the side of the truck so I called and let the dispatch know.  

I thought I was doing the right thing and then a sinking feeling hit me... what happens if the tow truck company doesn't say anything about the bike.  The company could just tie the bike higher and then not mention anything to the owner.  The owner would have very little proof that it wasn't that way when the tow truck got it.

"For context I have been dating my girlfriend for a year who was in America during an internship and moved back to Korea a few weeks ago until she can return to America on a student visa. I am visiting her and staying with her and her mom for two months.

Last night my girlfriend and I were coming back to her moms place after a long day. We were two blocks from her home when she said she felt hungry and wanted to go into a restaurant next to us. I said my phone was dying and I need WiFi to make phone calls to America before it gets too late, could you eat alone while I make phone calls? She got upset and at first I was surprised then she explained she’s afraid of walking at night alone even if it’s two blocks and she thought I was being selfish. I apologized right there and said I’d eat at the restaurant with her. she then said she changed her mind and no longer wants to.

For the next hour or so she was in a really bad mood. I got frustrated and we ended up having an argument for 30 minutes. Eventually it cooled down but as I was making phone calls I heard her speaking Korean to her mom (who doesn’t speak any English) in a upset voice and she looked sad, I needed to take a shower so on my way to the bathroom I said “are you talking to her about me?” And then my girlfriend started getting really upset and we both somewhat raised our voices. after it settled I apologized to her mom and my gf translated for me. I went to my room and my gf comes in saying her mom is still angry that I was shut in my room (making phone calls!) and raised my voice in front of her (in response to my gf also doing so) and my apology wasn’t enough and I will have to try again tomorrow. She said sometimes it takes a week for her mom to get over things like this.


This is all because I had wanted to call home while my gf ate close to home. I even quickly compromised and apologized but because that wasn’t enough now her mom is also mad at me.

I do not attend my children’s sports games because I do not care and I think that they do not care. My mom attended my sports games and thought that my divorced dad was a bad parent for not attending my sports games, but I honestly did not care if she attended, until grade 12. I did not tell her that to avoid hurting her feelings. My mom also cared more than I did about my practices and like grades, it made me nervous and I exaggerated. My wife and others tell me that just because I did not care does not mean that my children do not care, but just because other children do care does not mean that my children do care, and it is not uncommon for parents to care more than their children about their sports games. I asked my children if they care, and I made clear to them that I will not be hurt, not to bias them, but so they do not lie like I did, and they said no. However, my wife and others think that they lied to not hurt my feelings the other way, but I do not think so. I drive my children and support them financially and academically and emotionally with advice, and I attend their championships if any, but honestly, their athletic performances at this age have less impact on their future than grades, and children’s sports games are boring.

c1xa1v	2019-06-18 03:37:16	Digmansam	AITA for asking my boss about the transition from intern to junior site suprevisor and using a friend who had just joined the company as an example?	"I am currently studying a 4-year degree in construction management. The course is structured to allow people to work 3 days a week while it is still full-time study (first 2 years) and only takes up 10 days a semester during its part-time phase (second 2 years). 

Next week marks the end of my first 2 years. 2 weeks ago a friend I meet at the course joined the company I work for, he originally told me that he was joining as an intern like my self. Then when he was introduced at the company meeting I found out he was actually a junior site supervisor. When I asked him about it he said that he didn't believe he was going to be a junior site supervisor until he started and it was announced at the meeting. He originally was very insistent that we should not discuss anything contractual and that we shouldn't let the company know that we knew each other.  His reasoning was that he didn't want us to get jealous of each other's contracts. 

Extra note - I only joined the company 3 months ago due to the previous company I worked at going into liquidation. As such I rushed into the company and didn't get a full run down the intern program. 

Heres the potential asshole moment. Yesterday I asked the boss that with my friend being a junior site supervisor if it was planned for me to become a Junior Site supervisor in the next few weeks with our uni transition coming up. My boss said that my friend was finishing his studies at the end of the semester (he still has the 2 years left) and that's why he is coming into the junior site supervisor role as you make the transition from an intern into a junior site supervisor at the end of the degree. 

I called my friend to ask him if he had miscommunicated with the company about what stage of his degree he was in with the information I had just found out. He got extremely angry at me and pissed that I would mention I knew him through uni and he knew I would go crying to the boss about why I wasn't a junior site supervisor as well which is why he didn't want to discuss contractual stuff. He hung up when I was trying to defend my self. The previous company I worked for made a transition at this stage of study so I assumed this would be the protocol at this company.  

AITA? 

I should note that I am currently filling the role of a site supervisor on the current site that I am on. So as far as I am aware ability in the role has no effect on this. 

TLDR: Intern at a construction company coming up to part-time study from full-time study. A uni friend joins the company as a Junior site supervisor. I asked the boss if that is planned for me with our study transition that is happening soon. Boss said that my friend had finished his studies (We are at the same stage of our course) and that why he was coming into that position. The friend is pissed at me that I asked the boss about it."

Suddenly, at 11 PM, I'm awoken for her yelling my name. She asks me to carry the laundry baskets down for her. I tell her (or yell at her)  it's 11 and I'm not in a good mood. She freaks out and says she does everything for everyone else and no one cares. Eventually I do get up to help her because in already awake anyways. 

She has been someone sick lately and she does walk with a cane. She wouldn't be able to lift the baskets without me. I am very upset that she decides to wake me up at 11 for that, despite her sickness

To try getting my ex friend out of our game my brother and his friends were killing him in-game but it didn't work. At this point the four of us were starting to get mad so I messaged him again saying that he really needed to leave but he still didn't leave. This thing went around for like 3 more minutes untill I said that if he didn't leave I would unfriend him (FYI this basically meant that I wouldn't talked to him because he was moving). His response was him saying that he didn't care. I said two more times that he really needed to leave or that I would unfriend him but once again he said he didn't care. So I unfriend him. After I did this the kid realized that I did that and started to asking why I did it. So listed everything that happened in the last 10 minutes but he answered with ""What does that even mean?"" At this point I knew he couldn't be reasoned with so I just stopped messaging him. On discord I unfriended him but before his sister could say that I was being an ass I talked about what happened but she still took his side.

c1x8jk	2019-06-18 03:32:32	Undriel	AITA for not eating suspicious food, lying that I did and causing the owner to get sick?	"I was living with my ex bf and his housemates. My patience is short as hell and I usually can't tolerate drama in a cramped environment that is supposed to be my home: it would make me physically sick. For this reason, I go about things by trying to be (big emphasis on trying) the epitome of kindness so nobody ever argues with me and I can live in peace.

I respect personal spaces, I always clean up after myself and I never complain about anything if I can help it. Sadly, my desire for privacy and respect towards other people is not always appreciated nor reciprocated, and I had the displeasure of being caught up in a fustercluck that caused one of my housemates to get sick for days.

This gal comes up to me with a jar in her hands, and tells me: ""My aunt made this fruit jam a year ago. It’s homemade, obviously. I was thinking of eating it. Would you try it for me? If it’s good, I’m gonna eat it as well.”

My first reaction is to accept the ‘gift’ and thank her, so I take the jar to my room, sit down and think. I am confused and taken aback. What the heck? Is she using me as a test subject or what? I didn't want to suggest that she should have stayed away from it either, because I didn't want to offend her or her aunt's cooking skills.

So, I carefully lift the lid and smell the jam. It smells good, really. Then I examine the lid and I notice this suspicious cluster of something dark that appears to be mold right in the middle of it. I close the thing and I tell to my bf to not touch it whatsoever. He’s confused as well, but he notices how irked I am and doesn’t ask any questions.

The next morning I wake up before everyone else. Welp, I think, time to be courteous again. I take the jar to the kitchen, throw the content in the trash and wash the container thoroughly, eventually leaving it to dry on the table for my housemate to find.

Some hours later she finds the jar and asks if the food was good. “Very good,” I lie, “we’ve both had a great breakfast. Thank you.”

I go about my business for some more hours and that’s it. In the afternoon I decide to have a snack and go back to the kitchen. To my surprise, there is another one of those jars right next to the one I washed, and it’s empty. Her bf tells me she’s now sick and he’s rushing to buy some medicine. To this day I fail to realize if the face I made was sorry enough or something akin to “oh really”. I honestly wasn’t expecting that.

I explain to my bf why our housemate is sick. I also tell him that I didn’t like how she just blatantly treated me as a test subject, and I suggest that perhaps she got what she deserved. He calls me an idiot for not having told her that I didn’t eat the jam.

c1x7zx	2019-06-18 03:30:58		WIBTA if I was mad at my ex-crush who was my former close friend for wasting time on my current exchange with a new crush?	"This is a sequel to my last post, which was about my old relationship with “Emily”. (EMILY is the code name for her).

So, now that I’ve gotten over my other crush I was looking forward on moving on. Fast forward a few months, and I met a girl that I developed a crush on. Since “Emily” was my close friend, who is close with my current crush I had decided to ask her for some advice. Instead of giving me the truth(which I found out later on) she decided to give me half-hearted advice that catered to her feelings. 
Since this “crush” was moving to CA soon I decided to try and make a move before she would move to see if I could possibly start dating. But, since “Emily” was close friends with her she wanted to avoid me hurting her feelings and so decided to defer me by telling my lies like she was getting annoyed by my texts etc so I wouldn’t be able to date her. I found that out so I completely gave up since pursuing her would be obnoxious and a waste of time if she was annoyed right? Guess what that wasn’t true. ONTOP of that she was also helping this friend to try and “get to be more like-able” for me which was really just her butting in and making things worse. “Emily” also told stories of our relationship in the past in-order to avoid her from repeating the mistakes that she did. But, since me and “Emily” have a controversial relationship, she could potentially have developed a negative opinion without me ever noticing.

LUCKILY, I got into contact with her again albeit it being late June and me having two weeks to try and get things to work. I’ve started but I’ve already wasted a lot of time because of “Emily”. I ended up telling “Emily” off by essentially ranting to her by telling her how much of an idiot she is and how she almost ruined everything for me.

I perfectly understand where she’s coming from but I don’t understand why she never told me why she was doing these things behind my back and lying to me.

c1x7x1	2019-06-18 03:30:43	cucxmber	AITA for not wanting to play Minecraft with friends after one of the members (and close irl friend) insulted my appearance?	"I honestly don’t know a better title. Fake names used and ages not revealed due to privacy, but we are just teens. 

Anyway, yes, we play Minecraft together on a realm I own. The people in the server are me, another girl, and four other males. we also have a discord group chat for it. We’d call, build, and adventure together regularly.

Me and 2 of the male members got into a call on Saturday. We were playing, but decided to take a break and mainly talk, myself playing another game. 

The conversation drifted somehow, I wasn’t paying attention to it that much, and then James said, “well, you know Bob (weird incel-y guy) looks at your legs whenever you wear skirts.”

James and Dominic began laughing, and I was a bit hurt but I chuckled a bit and asked why they didn’t tell me about it which Dominic said “it was funny”. I was still a bit upset, so I just told them to tell me next time. 

Then, James spoke again.

“You should actually probably stop wearing skirts, a lot of guys look at your legs.” I was upset again that they didn’t tell me, I thought we were good friends and he knows about insecurity issues I harbor. Then, things escalated a bit, I was still a bit hurt, but then it just turned to talking about things I should/shouldn’t wear/do. Stuff like, “Stop wearing jackets and shorts, it looks like you have no pants” and “your lips are so puffy it looks like two pieces of rare steak” James was mainly saying this, though Dominic laughed and agreed. I told them to knock it off because I was genuinely hurt.

I finally left when he said “Oh, and headbands, you can just see a pimply forehead and-“. I was crying at this point. We had been good friends for a while, so it caught me off guard. They pinged me to rejoin, so I took a deep breath and reluctantly joined.

They said they were sorry, but honestly, I didn’t feel like they meant it. They basically just “yeah, I’m sorry for that” and “I’m sorry” but I didn’t really feel better about it. They began making fun of how other girls at school dressed saying things like “well (other girl in group chat) wears shorter skirts than you”.

I just quietly said “you don’t have to make fun of other people to make me feel better” and left the call. I saw they were still calling an hour later when I saw a comedy YouTube video get posted in the discord chat.

I canceled plans for an event they would be at on Monday. I still wanted to join back, because I loved playing mc and talking with them, but I wasn’t up to it. I kept quiet about it and just played another game with the other girl in our group chat. I didn’t tell anyone else about what happened.

They pinged me to join a call today, but all I said in the chat was “uh” and I didn’t respond.

I'm a 17 yo dude, turning 18 in September. I graduated from a private college 2 months ago, and I have a diploma. I have a FT job and it's been 2 months since I joined, I'll be working till end of the year.

Even though I earn my own money, my mum is very conscious of me spending money and she doesn't want me to spend it unnecessarily. That is understandable, but my reason for working is because I want to earn my own money so I can spend it whenever. (Don't worry I save too !) 

&#x200B;

Post below

For a very long time, I thought about getting tattoos. I always loved tattoos as I see it as art. Since I'm an Asian and my parents are conservative Asians who are in their late 50's, they see tattoos as a sign of notoriety/gangsterism.

I've been thinking of getting a tattoo sleeve since I was 15, and I created some designs and I'm sticking with it after 3 years. I don't exactly see tattoos as a cool trendy thing, I do see it as art with personal meaning , including aesthetic features.

My parents are anti tattoos, but I really want to get my sleeve. I earn and save my money, and now I want to spend it after 3 years of consideration. In my country there's no legal age to get a tattoo, some shops need parental consent, some don't. However, I will be asking my artist about his age restriction/rules.

I feel like I'm almost an adult to make such a decision, and I feel like telling my parents I'm getting a tattoo \*instead of asking them for permission\*. I also plan to get my tattoo 3 days before my 18th birthday.

My father was an abusive *monster* to me growing up, to the point I still carry scars over twelve years after I was put in foster case (I live alone now, as I'm 23, turning 24 on the 30th), and I've had nearly zero contact with him since (I met him once about five years ago to see if it'd help my PTSD from the abuse, but he showed no remorse or even interest in my well-being, so I left it alone). However, I received a call from my old therapist during that time on that my father is dying of cancer, and wants to bury the hatchet with me before he dies.

Against my better judgement, I accepted, and met him in a public space. While he was wheelchair bound, he still didn't seem to show any regret, but wanted me to apologize for removing him out of his life, and that he wanted us both to forget the past so he could spend his last months with his son. I said no, and that I didn't want to ever see or hear from him again, and left. He looked heartbroken as I left though. I've been thinking about it since, and I wanted to know. Am I the asshole for ignoring his dying wish, or was I right to try to leave it all behind me and move on?

EDIT: Thanks for the support. I struggle with depression and tend to fault myself on these matters, so it really helps, seeing that so many people think I did the right thing."	Not the A-hole	0	0	231.0	12.0	0.0	0.0
c1x66l	2019-06-18 03:25:42	Usersnam3	WIBTA If I recorded an employee telling me what purchasing a warranty for a product from their store would entail?	"I'm a huge gamer, I've been playing video games for about 16 years now and its one of my favorite hobbies. So my reason for asking this question actually dates back to when I was a kid some years ago. When my mother gave me some money on my birthday to go buy whatever I wanted. I used to play alot of handheld, so think Sony PSP and the like. I decided to head to my local mall and pick up a new Nintendo 2DS, they were on sale at the Gamestop I was shopping at for about 90$ so I bought one.

When I got to the counter the employee asks me if I'd like to purchase a warranty for my 2DS and I asked him what that would grant me. He then proceeds to tell me explicitly: ""It means that if your 2DS breaks, within the duration of the warranty for whatever reason. You can bring it back for a new one."" I tell him yes and get the warranty. Some hours later in what I can only describe as a fit of stupidity I accidentally forget that I left my 2DS under the blanket on my bed drop my knee on the screen of brand my new 2DS and utterly destroy it. I was devestated but then suddenly remembered ""Whatever."" I think to myself, I have my warranty so it doesn't matter.

The next day I take the broken 2DS in to exhange it for a new one and the same employee now tells  me that ""The warranty only covers defects that occured during production, the warranty doesn't cover any damage that the product substains out of the box. I'm sorry.""

Now I don't know if the guy accidentally mispoke the day before, or if he was just taking advantage of the fact that I was a kid and didn't know any better but I didn't get a new handheld for awhile after that, but I eventually did buy two more needless to say-without any warranties. 


Years later though and I'm still somewhat salty about it. In fact, I haven't bought warrenties alongside any new electronics that I have acquired throughout the years because of this experience regardless of what the person selling it to me tells me.

But I just had a thought; What if in front of the entire store I pulled out my phone and turned on my camera whenever someone mentions a warranty and asked them if they'd be okay with me recording whatever they would be about to tell me? That way, if anyone tries to pull that same crap on me like before I could maybe try and sue them for false advertising. So Reddit, I ask you-WIBTA for that?

Edit× Thanks for all the responses everyone, you guys work fast! Apparently, I've fallen somewhere between BTA and NTA so I'm just gonna go on a whim and conclude that there are NAH. From now on I'm just going to continue not buying warranties or simply reading whatever paperwork a more important warrenty comes with. The experience I had jaded me towards warrenties because I thought I had been cheated but in retrospect I have only myself to blame for my ignorance since I took the cashier at his word and did not read my warranty."

c1x64r	2019-06-18 03:25:33	chaonimaaa	AITA for not going to church with my SO's family?	"I've been with my SO for 2 years and it's known that although my SO's grandmother likes me, she doesn't like the fact that I'm not Christian. I'm not religious at all and I know nothing about Christianity or any of its practices. 

Some background if you want:

The only religious experiences I've had were when I was in a Church school when I was in kindergarten (I remember nothing but singing and daydreaming, also different religion) and I was part of my ex-friend's quincenera party where we had to attend a church service all in Spanish. I am very bad at Spanish, I understood nothing, and no one told me anything that I needed to do that day. I was panicking for two hours straight, afraid of offending everyone if I didn't do anything right.   


Recently my SO and I attended a funeral for one of their family members. There was a priest and a religious service where we had to listen to some readings(?) and as well as sing. I assumed that I should just go with the flow, but then suddenly everyone was lining up in front of the priest and some of the people gestured me to line up as well. I panicked as I didn't know what it was for and no one really explained. I ended up having a white circular chip(?) being placed in my mouth no questions asked. I took part of some singing that went on (although very low; I'm very shy when people are around), but I guess this event was seen as an invitation to being open about religion. The following weekend, SO's mother approached me to ask if I wanted to go to church with them, she said it was alright to say no but I knew what my SO's grandmother would think. I politely declined anyway. I really don't like being put into situations like that as it makes me feel very uncomfortable. Later on my SO said the right answer was to go with them.

One of my friends who is part of this, has been dodging to meet up. I should mention he's a medical student. That's his excuse. Every time we try to plan a meet up to move the game forward, he claims his studying schedule is intense and can't meet until the evening. He has been saying he's studying for the Step 1 (apparently a major medical school exam). The day is basically over by that time and we only get about a few hours to work on it. Sometimes, he doesn't even meet up at all. 

&#x200B;

I feel frustrated because I believe he can easily switch his schedule around to accommodate since he literally has nothing else to do but study where as I have to go to work so I'm not always free to meet up. 

He's just at home, studying. We argued multiple times about this and we are currently not on speaking terms. I truly don't believe he is studying as much as he says he is. He claims he needs to study for at least 6-8 hours/day. He keeps telling us that once he takes the exam, his schedule will be free but I highly doubt that and all i hear are excuses. AITA?"

c1x4j1	2019-06-18 03:20:48	conflictedaunt	WIBTA if I distance myself from my niece?	"I feel like I shouldn’t need to ask because of course I would be the asshole if I did this but I thought I would ask this sub for judgement just in case.

I have a three year old niece. When my sister went back to work after her daughter was born, the whole family kinda pitched in the help with childcare so they didn’t have to use a daycare. Her mother in law and our mother each looked after her for a few days a week. Eventually, with my extreme reluctance, I was rope in to help babysit maybe a total of seven day a month, sometimes more. Some of those day were super long, like eight hour days and I did this for about a year and a half. Somehow I become my niece’s favorite person during this time.

But I hate children. I’m childfree for a reason. And I’m not exactly big on my niece either but I suck it up because I’m adult enough to play nice with a small kid to help out my sister. But lately, it’s become harder and harder to do this. I’m not her mother so I defer to my sister in every case but it seems like the more I spend time with my niece the more my sister thinks I’m doing things wrong. Or saying the wrong things. I have to police all my actions and my words just in case my niece takes it the wrong way or it doesn’t align with her parents’ parenting plans and I am feeling judged for not knowing better.

Like yesterday we went to the park together. I was with my niece on the jungle gym and we were climbing it together. I got to a point where I wasn’t comfortable going any higher and I said “I’m going to go down because it’s scary” and immediately my niece didn’t want to go up any higher because she heard that and started parroting it. And now my sister is mad because I traumatized her daughter and peer pressured her daughter into limiting her possibilities because the person her daughter looked up to thought it was too scary. Okay, I’ll refrain from commenting about things being scary from now on if it’s damaging my niece so badly.

Things like this seem to be happening more and more but I’m starting to wondering if it’s really worth it. She’s not my kid, I don’t actually have a duty to be around her if anything I do or say is bad. I don’t even like kids and the way my niece is so fixated on me drives me a bit insane but I can suck it up because she’s a kid and I can eventually go home. But lately, I’m starting to wonder why I’m doing this in the first place if it just makes me miserable. So WIBTA if I pulled away?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Last September my grandfather died of cancer and it was devastating for all of us but specially to my grandmother who spent 60 years next to him.

My father has 2 siblings that don't really take care of my grandmother, one helps to pay the bills (for what we are all thankful) and the sister, she doesn't give a fuck about my grandmother and never takes care of her.

Well recently was father days an as per usual my dad had to take care of my grandma and he asked to my cousin to call my grandma to see how is she doing since she was so sad as nobody out of my close family called her. My cousin answered my dad that ""my grandma is alive and it's going to be alive for a long time"" and see expressed how she didn't care about her. And I'm furious as I'm the only grandkid who sleeps at my grandma's to take care of her.

The thing that pisses me off the most is not the answer per se it's how she's a fake Catholic that goes to church every Sunday and it's trying to run for a position in the government and portraits this fake persona online where she acts like the next mother Teresa while abandoning an excellent grandmother, who expend the entire day crying and asking why is she being left since my grandpa died.

"So I was hanging out with my friend chickentit today, and we found a store near our favorite restaurant that was selling wheelchairs for a cheap price. And since we both have jobs, free time, and a passion for dicking around, we went in there. The cheapest one was $25. So we decided to buy it and do wheelies on it and stuff. ( Yes we've had prior experience and are actually quite good at wheelchair wheelies. We can even move and turn while doing a wheelie.) So we split the cost, and we walked it to chickentit's house to go do some stunts & whatnot. Then chickentit says to me, ""hey toast, let's go to the giant Hill 2 blocks from my house"" so we go over there and ride it down a bunch of times ( and yes, we wiped out a couple times) and all is well.

Now here's the thing.

I told my dad about this and he said what we are doing is messed up because there are people who need wheelchairs and can't afford them. And while I understand, he was encouraging us to give it away to someone who needed it. However I was like ""no, we spent our own money on it. We did nothing wrong and buying a wheelchair for our own entertainment for a cheap price. besides they were selling a bunch of other ones with similar prices. ($30-35)"" he still wasn't having it and said we were morally wrong to do this. I also told him that when we got bored of it we would give it to someone who needed it. But he said we should get rid of it right now, even though we made a completely justifiable purchase of something to entertain ourselves.

I feel like my dad's being kind of ridiculous about this. But am I really I'm the wrong for doing this? I mean I'm gonna give it away when I get bored of it. But still, AITA

My fairly elderly parents and I travel around the globe a couple times a year for 2-3 weeks at a time. This has been a long standing thing as we all really enjoy seeing new things and experiencing different cultures together.

I also travel internationally for work a couple times a year.
My gf is a bit older than I and currently cannot take the same amount of time off nor can she afford to go without financial assistance. She would also have to leave her teenage son and dog unsupervised for the trip.
My family and I have offered to help her but she is fiercely independent and refuses.

Recently the discussion got rather heated as whether or not I can remain with her or continue my travels.

c1wx9b	2019-06-18 03:00:02		WIBTA for eventually cutting ties with my parents? [16M]	"So I've got a kind of complicated situation. To summarize it, my current intentions are to cut ties with my parents as soon as I'm financially independent, because I hold a grudge against them for what's been going on the past few years. Here are my reasons:

The first one is on me; I have trouble caring about people in general - especially if I've had an experience with them that I still hold against them. Maybe I have trust issues; maybe I have a slight personality disorder or something; maybe I have trouble creating and expressing feelings for people due to lack of experience. The end result is the same.

The second reason is that I feel like they've kind of unintentionally neglected me - I don't know if it's because they don't want to admit when they know there's something wrong with me or if they're just bad at recognizing problems. I have (I think) good reason to believe I have un-diagnosed ADHD. I almost certainly had un-diagnosed depression for 1-3 years, and I still have some symptoms today, though most have either subsided or disappeared. Even if you don't know how to recognize some of these, the symptoms are still self-evidently problems: staying all day nearly every day on my computer, procrastinating assignments until the night before they're due, waking up in the middle of the afternoon most days, almost always in a bad mood, avoiding them whenever possible, not eating enough, etc. Yet despite knowing these problems existed, my parents did nothing about them.

You may be wondering why I didn't just tell them, or anyone else any of these things - the answer is the third reason. Every time I do something stupid (which isn't terribly often,) that they find out about, all they do is explain why it's wrong, not consider other perspectives, pretend they know why I did it and not listen to a word I say. Most of the time I recognize my mistake after I do it, but even when I try to explain my reasoning and why it was wrong they still don't listen to me and act like I did it for a completely different reason. Because of this I feel like if I told them any of my problems or thoughts, they would just think they understand when they don't, pretend to know what's best for me, and not listen to me: the person who has had months to think and research these things, and knows me and my situation better than anyone else. In any case, I was experiencing major, potentially life-threatening issues in my life and didn't even feel like I could talk to my own parents about them.

I obviously have my own opinions about the situation, but I do want to hear the reasoning of others'. Hopefully I've provided enough relevant information for you to make your own educated opinion."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1wwgm	2019-06-18 02:57:40	SpeedyboyAubameyang	AITA for telling my cousin that he’s short because he’s vegan?	"So I have this cousin who’s vegan/vegetarian(not sure what the difference is). He’s always been the “sensitive” cousin. Like I have a lot of cousins and we are all really close. None of us are really sensitive about stuff like we all roast on each other like cousins do but he’s the one no one really does it too because he gets offended. His parents are kinda like that too. They lecture the rest of us on how we should b vegan and other shit like that. 

All of us were outside taking a break from playing a game of basketball and were doing a  dunking competition. Since I was the only one that could actually dunk cousin M15 asked me M15 how I got so tall (im not that tall like 6’1-6’2) and cousin is like 5’5. I jokingly said something like “your parents sold you bruh u not finna grow eating carrots for breakfast, lunch, and dinner”. It was just a joke but he took it serious and got really upset and started screaming about how he’s healthier than me and more athletic because of how much better he eats. I didn’t wanna deal with him so I just said “ok lil tyke” (ig looking back that jus made him more mad). 

So later his parents came up to me to talk and I was like whatever my bad. But then they started showing me studies on being vegan n shii. They wanted me to go apologize and tell him that being a vegan is better for him, that he will grow, that I’m more at risk for certain diseases cuz of meat, and that he’s more athletic than me “in certain ways” (whatever the fuck that means) because of his healthy eating. Stupidly I started arguing wit them about how what they are saying is just isn’t true and I’m not gonna lie to him. My uncle started talking about how much being vegan helped him be an athlete and how in his prime he was prolly better more athletic than me and kept trying to convince me more. I couldn’t really believe what he was saying because it was making no sense. It was really annoying hearing that from him because he is basically a kid trying to say he was ever a better athlete than me (he was like 5’8 and not athletic in anyway). 

So I basically just ended up just agreeing with them and walking away because I didn’t feel like dealing with them anymore. When I talked to my cousin again I just told him straight up that “it’s his body and if he wants to eat meat he can and if he wants to eat only veggies he can. But in my opinion eating meat gives better results if you look at how his dad turned out and how I turned out but either way I don’t really ion really give a shit bc it’s not my body. “

Edit: I know being vegan prolly isn’t stopping him from growing. It’s most likely just genes. But I said it as a joke to him, I don’t give a shit what he eats but that doesn’t mean I won’t roast him for it like everyone else gets roasted for certain things."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	639.0	113.0	0.0	0.0

We both rent. We’re on the bottom floor and they’re on the top. They’re both self contained. The front yard is a shared area with car parks but I’m responsible for the front lawns. The back yard is just for upstairs and is gated and locked so I have no access.

There is constantly dog shit everywhere in the back yard, I’ve lived here for about 6 months and they’ve only cleaned it up a handful of times. We’re on the ground level and have heaps of windows that look out to the backyard. For some reason the dog always seems to go right next to the building and near our windows.

I’ve made complaints to the people we rent from and want the neighbours to clean it up everyday. It would take a minute or two. I don’t know if that overkill or not but I’m sick of the dog shit. 

AITA for telling someone to clean up after their dog in their yard. A few people even my wife have said I should just let it go as I’ve made a few complaints over the last months and nothing’s changed.

Also the neighbours had made complaints about the front yard as the grass was too long, which caused our rent to be raised."	Not enough info	0	0	32.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

&#x200B;

I have eight siblings, six sisters and two brothers. My two brothers and three of my sisters have moved out, I'm still stuck at home with two of my sisters. The other one perished at birth. This is important, because the situation revolves around some of them.

I'm the middle of my batch, my youngest sister is a jerk, and I'm really close to my slightly older sister. I will be referring to my younger sister as Jerkface (she's skinny) and my slightly older one as Goodsis (she's a little plump).

The conversation went as follows:

&#x200B;

The setting is me leaning out of the door, Jerkface on the porch and Mom is just off of the porch.

&#x200B;

Me: Hey, Jerkface, where's your glasses?

&#x200B;

Jerkface: \*gets up in my face\* Stay out of my business. \*shoves me\*

&#x200B;

**Me:** Ow! Mom, Jerkface just pushed me!

&#x200B;

**Mom:** Jerkface, did you punch OP?

&#x200B;

**Jerkface:** I lightly tapper her!

&#x200B;

**Mom**: Jerkface, you pushed her.

&#x200B;

**Jerkface:** Just because she got in my business!

&#x200B;

**Mom**: I'm the parent, OP. I will get in her business.

&#x200B;

**Me**: I'm just doing it since you're not acting like a parent.

&#x200B;

**Mom**: You're grounded from electronics for the rest of the night.

&#x200B;

Should I have said that? Was I the asshole for saying the truth? The next conversation was the next day in the kitchen.

&#x200B;

**Mom**: You know some of the sticks in the yard need to be picked up.

&#x200B;

**Me**: I'm sorry, who cleaned inside? Jerkface and Goodsis can pick up sticks.

&#x200B;

**Mom:** I'm not going to bicker with you.

&#x200B;

It didn't seem that bad, right? But then this happened. Keep in mind that Jerkface is skinny and Goodsis isn't. This is the same day around the dinning room table.

&#x200B;

**Jerkface**: Mooommm I think I'll have Goodsis's figure when I grow up.

&#x200B;

**Me**: What?

&#x200B;

**Jerkface**: I'm getting fat. (She really isn't)

&#x200B;

**Mom**: \*laughs\*

&#x200B;

**Goodsis**: You just called me fat!

&#x200B;

Jerkface just laughs, and Mom realizes she just has to parent again.

&#x200B;

**Mom:** That's a little mean.

&#x200B;

**Goodsis**: Well if you don't want to get fat then you shouldn't eat junk food, you don't want to get fat and ugly.

&#x200B;

**Mom**: Hey! No.

&#x200B;

**Me**: We were making a reference!

&#x200B;

Then we proceeded to get yelled at. I just don't get why we got yelled out when Jerkface was in the wrong. Or was I the asshole for saying the things I did?"	Asshole	0	0	17.0	8.0	0.0	0.0

Well, he finally got a job and had his first day of work today. After working a total of 8 hours, he says he's not going back.

&#x200B;

While I respect that he shouldn't be forced to do a job he ""hates,"" his field certainly requires you to ""work your way up the ladder,"" so to speak; it isn't expected that the first job he gets out of college is one he will love that also pays well.

&#x200B;

I think our difference of opinion on the matter stems from our upbringing... I feel upset because I feel like he gave up too easily. In my family, we've always had to work for what we want. I worked a couple minimum wage jobs in high school which absolutely sucked, but I needed to save the money to go to college, where I worked really hard and got scholarships. My boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to just get things handed to him and has never worked a real job before.

&#x200B;

I'm not **mad** that he quit so easily... I think I'm upset because this just adds to my fears that he'll never get a job and become the mature adult I want him to be, which has always been a point of contention with us. AITA?

I’m South Korean (born there), but I grew up in a US community that was close to being all white. It was pretty common for strangers to ask me where I’m from. When I was younger (high school age and below), I’d just tell them, somewhat begrudgingly. 
I have pretty mixed feelings about my ethnic identity; I’ve just always felt out of place. So whenever someone asks me where I’m from, it just reminds me of the fact that I don’t blend in.
I moved to a very diverse part of the country several years ago. I still get asked about my ethnicity, but thankfully not as often. 
When someone does ask me the dreaded question, “where are you from?” 
I tell them I’m from [city in which I currently reside].
They then typically ask, “no, but, where are you _from_?”
I tell them the name of my white hometown. 

AITA for knowing they’re asking about my ethnicity and intentionally avoiding that answer? I think I just want to deny them any satisfaction simply because I hate this question so much. I know they’re just curious and perhaps just want to start a conversation/fill dead air. I definitely feel like I’m being rude, but in the least awkward way I could think of.

"My dad and I went out to eat today (belated father’s day meal at his request) and when the bill came he expected me to pay. First off, I really didn’t want to go out to eat because I’m still (obviously) not over the abuse I experienced as a child. He was physically and mentally abusive to me and my mother (they’re divorced) and he’s never acknowledged/apologized for it. (I’ve brought it up several times but he just denied it. But I was there. It happened. The man needs to stop trying to gaslight me.)

He (and my mother) are so passive aggressive and their aggression has peaked as of late. I believe the reason this happened was because I quit my job (after getting a masters and working for a top firm in my industry) and am now a stay at home SO and pursuing other hobbies, such as learning programming. My SO has a good job and is able to support me so I’m grateful for this. Point is, I’m not costing my parents any money. Not a dime. 

Anyway, my dad is upset that I didn’t pay the bill. I never indicated I would. I did, however, wish him happy Father’s Day and get him a nice card. I just didn’t feel as if I should pay for the meal. Especially because when we were ordering he was saying, “get whatever you like!” (Which I didn’t.) Also, because I quit my job, he expects me to hang out with him all the time (he’s retired), but I’m still busy with my own life and hobbies and I really do resent him and his narcissistic mannerisms. 

And once I get home, my mom calls and we start talking and I casually mention my dad and I went out to eat and she immediately asks when I’m going to take her out to eat. The issues I have with her would take me far too long to unpack, but she is extremely entitled, has never made me a priority since she remarried, and puts all the blame for us not getting along solely on me. I just told her she was acting entitled and let her know I didn’t pay for my dad’s meal. I’m very matter of fact with her and it drives her nuts. Yesterday, she called me and when I returned her call, she was (for the third fucking year in a row) trying to get me to wish my stepdad (who I have never really gotten along with or recognized as a father figure) happy Father’s Day. I snapped and yelled that he wasn’t my father and that she needed to stop doing this. She just doesn’t respect my boundaries. 

I could have easily slapped down my card that my SO and I share and paid for the meal, but I don’t want to because I’m so angry. And resentful. And tired of being disrespected by them. I also feel alone because they’re not really there for me. Both are always too consumed with themselves (dad) and new husband (mom).  End of rant :)"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I’m gay, my boyfriend is bisexual.

I’m admittedly insecure and occasionally have jealousy issues. My boyfriend is insanely attractive and, while I’m not “ugly” by any standards, I’m nothing compared to him.

It bothers me that he can virtually have anyone of either gender. I’m afraid that he will leave me for someone else.

It’s always bothered me that he is also attracted to girls. I don’t really get it. Why is he attracted to other people (of the other gender) when he is dating me (who is a guy) ?

I’ve never really gotten the whole “bisexual” thing. Maybe I’m shallow.

We were watching a movie with another friend (his friend, who is a lesbian) when his friend made a remark (to him). She pointed out that one of the girls in the movie was “hot”. My boyfriend kinda shrugged and said that “she’s cute”.

I don’t know why, but that really bothered me. I didnt want to make a scene, so I waited until his friend left. We had already talked about him and his attraction to women. I’m not saying that he can’t be attracted to women, just that I personally don’t “get” it, and I don’t want to know about it either.

He apologized, said he forgot and that he was just responding to his friend. That’s understandable, but then he said that he “can’t just stop his attraction for women”. Which started a whole argument. I told him that he shouldn’t be attracted to other people when he’s in a relationship, he said otherwise.

He said that its okay to find other people attractive, just as long as you don’t act on it. I said that he only thought that because he was bisexual, and that all bisexual people think like that. He said that it wasn’t true, and I told him that he should just pick a side at this point. He is a guy, dating a guy, so he should just he gay. There’s no need to be attracted to women unless he has the intent to cheat on me.

I guess that made him upset, because he told me that he wasn’t going to talk about this with me and he left. I really couldn’t tell if he was mad or not but he just left. 

His sister called me a few hours ago and told me that I was being a jerk. This isn’t the first time this has happened. She said she doesn’t even know why my boyfriend is still with me, implying that I’m *always* a jerk.

Hes very much in and out of it. He's staying at my sister since she is closer and her family is out of the house. 
My SO and I started talk about taking a vacation over a month ago until all this happened. Bc me and my sister are trading out some watching him bc it's a full time job. My sister said she would be okay for a couple days if we wanted to go. We were talking about going for over a week before. 

We originally planned on leaving this Friday and staying until next Friday. But my sister needs me to stay this weekend. So I was talking to my husband about the change in plans. We had talked about only going if my dad was doing better. He doesn't want to talk a whole week off work even though it was the original plan we are just not leaving as earlier. 

I've been under alot of stress with my dad and dragging my seven year old back and forth. Plus sleep is really hard to come by especially on my sister's couch. So when he raised his voice I started crying.

I had been planning this trip by myself. He wanted to go but anytime I ask anything he would say whatever you think. Now it's a week before and we finally have everything planned he wants to change his mind.

He ask why I was crying. I said I'm tired of being like your mom. I've made all the plans, got the tickets, going to cook the food, pack the car, do all the driving and now you want to change everything.


Well that started a fight as you can imagine. I've been going back and forth to my dad, taking care of our son, cooking everyday, still keeping up with the bills and animals. I even started washing clothes and packing for our trip today while trying to precook for our week so it could all be done for every day.

c1wmq0	2019-06-18 02:30:13	brewerybridetobe	AITA for telling my best friend her boyfriend is cheating on her?	"(Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile).

When my best friend (24 F) started dating a new guy (23 M) none of her family approved because he had recently fooled around with her younger cousin and ended things badly. Immediately afterwards (same week) my friend got involved with him behind her cousin’s back, and they had a huge fight when her younger cousin found out. Anyway... I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but he gave off a weird vibe and seemed pretty arrogant. They didn’t seem like a good match, and I couldn’t see what she saw in him.

Fast forward a few months and she was head over heels and exchanging “I Love Yous”. We both share a mutual friend (24 M), who is gay and mostly attracted to “straight” guys (his words). He got on well with her boyfriend immediately... maybe a little too well.

He confessed to me that he had been messaging our best friend’s boyfriend for months and showed me some of the messages he’d received from her boyfriend, mostly sexting (naked/semi-naked photos, sexually explicit videos), talking about his past conquests with other men, and several plans for them to meet up when our best friend was at work/studying. I didn’t see many incriminating photos from my friend, he either deleted them before showing me or covered them up with his hand. He told me that her boyfriend initiated things, but wouldn’t come clean about whether they actually hooked up in person or not. Either way I thought it was a huge betrayal on our best friend because, to her knowledge, her boyfriend was straight and they were official/exclusive. I urged him to confess it to her, and that he wouldn’t be much of a friend if he didn’t. He eventually agreed but only if I came along for support when he told her. 

Well I did, and when we met with our best friend to tell her he didn’t do much talking, but showed her the messages as proof. She was pretty upset and said she’d have to talk to her boyfriend about it. Well I’m not sure what they discussed, because soon after she cut everyone who knew about the cheating out of her life (me, mutual friend and other mutual friends he also told), and is still together with her boyfriend nearly a year later.

So AITA for telling her, or should I just have ignored it and let our mutual friend continue what he was doing (he was attracted to her boyfriend and IMO would have continued messaging/hooking up with him... Maybe he still is?). I’m sad that she ended our friendship over it, but I don’t regret telling her the truth."	Not the A-hole	0	0	885.0	82.0	0.0	0.0
c1wmpu	2019-06-18 02:30:12	tohellwithdishes	AITA for babysitting my own daughter?	"Background: I have a six year daughter, Mary. Her father and I split when she was 6 months old, and we've had 50/50 custody ever since. 7 days/7 days. It was ugly in the beginning, but for the last 4 years, it's been nothing but amicable. We accommodate overlapping vacations, pick her up when the school nurse calls if either of us is at work, etc. My husband loves her like his own and had been in her life for 4 years.

Her dad called me yesterday as I was walking into work and said 'Hey, since it's the summer and I work 7am/~3pm, instead of paying someone else to watch her, would you mind if I paid the money to you and you keep her for me during the day?' I was a bit reluctant, but agreed because I could use the money for extra activities during the summer such as water parks, museums, an out of town trip to the aquarium that she's been begging for, all the extras I normally put off because they're out of our monthly budget. The money is STRICTLY for her. My own decision, not his. We have never had a child support agreement. The extra money certainly would help when an aquarium ticket is $88. 

I didn't get home until 11pm last night from am extremely busy shift. Think prime real estate in the center of downtown during the summer. So busy I couldn't get a moment to check, call, or text from my phone to tell him. I called when I got off, but he was asleep. I didn't think it would be something I would even have to ask. I've missed half of my daughter's life and he's seen me break down in hysterics over it. The deal gets me an extra 80 hours/month with her vs spending that 80 hours in a day care. It's not about money, but time. It's only for 2 months, but this time is so valuable to me and my husband KNOWS that.

He dropped her off at 630 this morning and when my husband came downstairs, he blew up. He said I'm being used as free daycare and now I'm a slave to his every whim and that he's now free to use me as much as he wants. He said he didn't want him knowing our address, but my daughter had told her dad our address when we made her memorize it and you can see our house from the street and she's pointed it out to him multiple times, which my husband knows about and had never had a problem with. Her dad doesn't come to the door, only watched her from the street to make sure she gets inside and calls me when he arrives to send her out. I didn't even get a chance to explain ANYTHING before he stormed out of the door. He hasn't spoken to me since 7am and locked himself in his room when I got home today. 

AITA here? Should I have woken him up to ask him if I could keep my own daughter an extra 80hrs a week? We discuss every decision beforehand, but I feel as though this is something that shouldn't even have had to be discussed. She arrives as he's walking out of the door and is gone before he gets home.

Edit: I did say 80/week. My bad, y'all. I meant 80/month. Watching her during his 2 weeks of custody.

Edit 2: Reading back, nevermind.

Edit 3: I didn't see it at the time bc I was floored by it, but I know why he's upset over it. Thinking back to other times, he thinks he's going to potentially screw me over by using it against me. Commenters asking for left out details made me think way far back. When I said it was ugly, I mean, it was UGLY. He was an addict and an abuser. He would say one thing and do another and throw it in my face, causing me a lot of pain. It took about a year, but he got clean and sober, got therapy (although he isn't currently going), and over time, we were able to effectively communicate. Eventually we could sit together at dance class and discuss upcoming vacations, school plans, basically how we were going to co-parent and split costs. Husband knows for an ABSOLUTE fact there's nothing to worry about with us. I show him our text conversations and don't leave the room when he calls. He doesn't know it's part of our custody agreement to ask me first, and honestly, I don't even think her dad does either. There's not a way to use it against me, as I told him via text as a back up using the money only for her. Husband has always been cautious with him and husband is a man who thinks 5 steps ahead.

c1wlq5	2019-06-18 02:27:26	sneakersqueak	AITA for making a dumb joke as a serious/casual question?	"I asked my wife today ""Do you think Miley Cyrus has a bush?"" and she got really upset with me. I said it in a serious manner but jokingly, which I do sometimes with random questions/statements like that. She got really upset and said ""What if I said to you some random guy has a small or large penis?"" I then told her ""I mean you can say anything you want.."" She just appeared to be vindictive in the sense she was gauging my reaction, and then proceeded to apologize right shortly after. This isn't the first time she has done this and I am starting to pick up the pattern. Typically in my friend group we all get a little rowdy and say stupid/silly shit that we all know is dumb, but she has always been somewhat uncomfortable or just like she doesn't want to engage. I just want to know if I need to stop this altogether even though I feel as though this is just me being dumb/part of my personality and has been for the 10 years we've been together. In retrospect I realized though she has seemingly ignored me and never says anything other than a sigh or something when it comes to stuff like that. I am worried because she grew up in a household with super strict parents that told her to basically never smile or make it look as though she is  having fun so it is making me feel like there is a lot of stuff that is unworked underneath and messing with my head.

c1wiun	2019-06-18 02:19:12	DenialWhammy	AITA School Finals	"Hi guys, new to Reddit here.

I don't like to give much background about me 
so I'll get to the point.

Today is the day before finals and I feel pretty prepared for it, so I decide to watch a little r/Slash before going upstairs and maybe doing some extra last minute studying.

My mom and dad see me, and raise their voices to tell them to give back the phone and to go back and study. Understanding their intentions, I give them the phone, and ask them to please keep their voices lowered (We kind of have a family problem and don't seem to manage 3 days w/o fighting). I then ask my mom and dad if they could help me with their finals.

Sounds reasonable, right? No, wrong I guess. My dad made a big fuss about how he is in the middle of dinner and how I shouls be more responsible in my studies and shouting at me for asking such a thing. I asked him if he could help me afterwards, but this seems to make the problem worse. My mom silently motioned for me to go upstairs, and my dad kept shouting at me.

I told him I'd ask the Internet about it, and he waved it off like I wasn't taking this seriously (which I am doing 100%).

I talked with him afterwards, and he says my attitude has been terrible. The thing is tho I've tried really hard for this. I went about 1 and a half hours on the internet today for a refreshment, 30 minutes at home before going to badminton class, 30 minutes on the ride coming from badminton class, and 30 minutes after dinner. I'm not so sure if watching yt after dinner was the right thing, your call guys, but if I genuinely ask for help with studying, I thought I would receive at least a polite no, but it's a big matter I guess.

AITA here?

I hope I'll get one reply guys, thanks for replying if you do.

Peace, DenialWhammy

Edit: For those of you who asked, I feel ready for the finals. Asking for help was just because they said last minute studying should be needed. I studied for each of these classes starting about a week ago, and I'm studying right now just for review. Thanks again!"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c1whkk	2019-06-18 02:15:33	Pinetree218	AITA for Basically Hating my Grandmother?	"My grandmother on my dad’s side (G) has always been one of the hardest people to understand. My nuclear has plenty of times they’ve had to deal with her shit and honestly, I’m at the end of my rope.

She’s always had favorites when it comes to kids. My dad has a brother and a sister (A=aunt, U=uncle) and he was the one that was mostly left out. He doesn’t talk that much about his relationship with G, but U was always the most favored. I’m not sure if A was too, but she seems to have a decent relationship with G nowadays, so I’ll assume she was. Ironically, U is an asshole and my dad is not. A is a sweetheart though. So is my grandfather by the way. I have no idea why he married her. G was nasty to my mom too but that’s died down over the years. Still, my mom prefers to spend as little time around G as possible.

When it comes to grandkids, there are seven of us and all but two of us (my cousin I’ll call L and me) are boys. L herself plays softball though. I’m not a boy and I’m not good at sports so I ended up the least favorite grandchild. She would hardly come to events for me unless my parents asked her to but would be there for my cousins. She would often compare me to them too. If anything, she just gives me money and calls it a day.

The final straw came when I was graduating from college. I was an honor’s student and had made the Dean’s List. G decided not to come to my ceremony even though my dad begged her to and my grandfather was dying to come (he has medical problems so he couldn’t come on his own). My college is five hours away so you could say that she’s just getting too old to drive that far. However, my cousins (U’s kids) live EIGHT hours away and she never hesitates to drive and see them. I finally had it and decided that she doesn’t care about me; at least, not as much as she cares about my cousins or my brother. I told my dad this and I could tell it really broke his heart. That was more for my sake than G’s though.

I’ve been holding a major grudge against G since. Any time she’s mentioned in conversation I immediately become hostile. Unless she is standing in the room, I don’t hide how I’m feeling. My parents have asked me time and time again not to hold a grudge against her and get upset whenever I ignore this. A part of me feels bad about my behavior though because I can tell this makes my dad sad. I know it’s me he’s sad for, but I feel like it could be in a bit of defense of his mother, even though he knows how tough she is to deal with. I’m also a devout Christian and one of Christianity’s most important elements is forgiveness.

My question is being asked entirely for the sake of all that I just mentioned; am I the asshole for being so hostile or should I be free to express my anger?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	250.0	225.0	0.0	0.0

I always take things she said with a grain of salt, however her parents were moving to another state. She asked me to take a week off work to help her move. While I wasn’t necessarily in a position to do that, I agreed since it wouldn’t cost much for me to go since her parents (sigh) were paying for everything. A week before I asked one final time if she was ready to move on Saturday and she said yes, so i kept my days requested off. Not even 4 days later, she tells me we aren’t going because she didn’t pack or do anything. I was furious. She knew the entire time that she was not going to be going. Yet she kept making sure I had these days off. Then, I not only missed out on over a weeks worth of pay, she said it was my fault for taking the days off in the first place. We haven’t talked since.

c1wh0i	2019-06-18 02:13:53	ephemere2012	WIBTA for kicking out my roommate for being annoying?	"I have a great apartment with my sister and roommate Jen. I was studying abroad this past year and subleased my room for 8 months. Since I wasnt going to be there, I let my sister and Jen choose their ""temporary roommate"".

They picked a guy who, while not a bad guy by any means, I also would never have picked. He talks A LOT and doesnt listen. Whatever you answer, he goes on ignoring it. He's always bragging, too. He doesnt read social cues, and has followed me while I backed out of a room, as i was trying to subtly end the discussion. I've figured out i literally have to tell him ""I dont want to talk"" or ""please stop talking"", but then he touchy the rest of the evening

The other thing is that he always has his door open onto the hallway and, though i dont think he's trying to be inappropriate, he always stares when I walk by, which makes me feel pretty uncomfortable, especially for the 5 steps between the bathroom and my room, when i come out of the shower etc. Not a bad guy, just not used to living with women probably. He also ""flirted"" with me in the beginning but I made it clear that was not ok and he has since stopped.

He does other slightly annoying things like leaving dishes lying around, never turning his fan off, etc. but I realize these would be ordinary roommate things from anyone else, they just annoy me because HE annoys me.

So anyways I only lived with him for 2 weeks last Fall and then left for 8 months while he sublet my room. I came back just as my Jen left for the summer, and so he took her room. It felt like the natural thing to do and made Jen's life easier, so i didnt question it. Now it's been a month, and I was thinking ""i cant wait for him to leave"", but Jen just told us she is not coming back. Our lease will be renewed on Sept 1st, so now is the time to tell the landlord who will be on it for the next year. The guy clearly wants to stay, and objectively it would make the most sense, I mean he will have lived here for a year at that point. But the thing is, once he gets on the lease, I will be stuck with him for however long he chooses to stay.

And I really dont want to live with him. He is obviously a good person who just needs extra patience, but I have a demanding job (long hours, emotionally draining) and I just feel on edge when at home, like I dont get to rest properly. The other night I just hid in my room the whole evening because I couldnt deal with him.

So I wish I could tell him, as kindly as possible, that we will be looking for another roommate and that he needs to move out on Sept 1st. I could blame it on not being comfortable living with a guy (somewhat true).

\*On the apartment: the reason I wont even consider me moving out is because I love the place and I am the one who invested all the work getting it set up before my sister moved in with me (and I bought all the shared furniture for the living room, kitchen, the dishes, etc). It's my home, but I dont feel comfortable in it right now."	No A-holes here	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

In an effort to not be too specific, let’s just say she’s suffered some major life changes in all areas including relationships, employment, family, and life in general.

About a year ago, she suffered a complete breakdown and was hospitalized. I think it stunned her as much as it did the rest of us. She’s been making big strides but she’s not “back” yet, I don’t think. 

For instance, everyday things still seem to be a challenge. Getting up on time, getting the kids to school, & showering regularly seems to be a struggle. But she’s maintaining those things to the point where they’re not publicly noticeable, I think I just pick up on them. 

Her motivation as far as our household goes is non-existent though. I don’t think she’s folded a single load of laundry, unloaded the dishwasher, or even picked something up off the floor in almost a year. If I don’t do it, it doesn’t get done. No matter how gross the house gets.

I work full time days with a long commute and have repeatedly mentioned how I feel like I can’t keep up with everything on my own. She says she will do better but never follows through. Am I the asshole for considering going on strike and seeing how it plays out?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1wgkk	2019-06-18 02:12:35		WIBTA if I told my husband he put me in an awkward situation?	"My husband and I have a 10 month old daughter. We've been having a hard time finding a sitter, but I should clarify I am the only one doing any legwork in regards to it. I'm the one who spent forever finding one who meets our needs, interviewing people, and giving them their schedule every week.

Recently I found a pretty decent girl. She's 24, and has been working for us for a few months.

My husband found out she's looking to go to college, and told her (when I wasn't around) about where I work -- I'm a manager for a corporate chain that offers free college education, even to part time employees. He's a good husband and asks about my days so he happens to know through conversation that I'm hiring at the moment, which he told her.

So he tells the sitter to apply, either for my store or another.

This really screws us over in many ways. First, we need her open availability for sitting. Second, I can't be associated with employees like this outside of work -- which he already knows, as we had an employee for a neighboring store sit for a time and it almost became an issue.

I was put on the spot by said sitter when I got home, because she excitedly asked me all about it. I said hiring depends on how this summer will go (which is true). I told her who to call about the college program to see if the courses even appeal to her because idk her major.

WIBTA if I told him I understand his motivation was kind (informing her about my company's pretty cool incentives) or should I just gracefully let it go with him, and direct her to another store? I know he didn't mean ill so I don't think he's TA, I just want to know if shitting on his gesture makes me TA.

She's going to be unavailable in the winter anyway due to family obligations, but having to plan for a new sitter already in August versus December-January is irritating."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1wfe8	2019-06-18 02:09:11	Thnk4thdimensionally	AITA for getting upset when my husband asked if I knew how to pump gas?	"My husband and I have been together for seven years, we met and got together in our mid 20s. I'll preface this post by saying we both started driving at 16, we both had cars in our teens and early 20s, and we know this about each other as we've talked about our old cars, driving trips we went on, etc.

We used to have a car when we lived abroad a few years ago (also where we met), for whatever reason most gas stations there would pump the gas for you and no one really did it themselves or got out of the car. I drove a scooter there too and the attendant always pumped for me even when I said I can do it myself. We now live back in the US and we got a car for the first time here in December. I've been driving this car to work every day for a few months, he uses the subway to get to his job.

Whenever we stop to get gas together my husband normally pumps it. Many times already he's said before we go somewhere together that we better stop for gas, and I tell him I stopped earlier when I was coming home from work and filled it up, and he's said thanks for doing it. He even asked if my credit card worked at the place near our house as his kept getting rejected for a while so he knows I've gotten gas alone.

Today we stopped to get gas and he mentioned we should get a drink, I asked him to run in to get the drink while I pump. He asked if I knew how to pump gas, I thought he was joking and said no, I have no idea. He said ""You don't know how?"" I asked why he was making this joke and he said he wasn't joking. I said ""You know I've been driving since I was 16 and that I've gotten gas by myself several times before picking you up."" He said ""Sorry, southern women don't know how to pump gas"" which is a reference to where he grew up, I grew up in Ohio.

I was upset but we went to the store together. He noticed I was upset but we continued talking about what we need to buy. On the way home he pushed me to tell him why I was upset. I told him I felt embarrassed that he thought I, a 31 year old woman who'd been driving half her life didn't know how to pump gas, and he knew I filled up the tank several times before picking him up. I felt like he thought I was incompetent. He said he just forgot and it wasn't meant to offend me. He thinks I shouldn't be upset since he didn't mean any harm. I agree he wasn't trying to hurt me, but it still hurt me and made me feel like he thinks I'm an idiot that he thought I wasn't able to pump gas. It's not like I just learned how to drive. We're both American so most places here are self serve. I've never seen a place here where someone would pump for you, I thought it was illegal or just never really done.

AITA for being upset about this? Is this a normal thing to forget for a minute with long term partners? Am I going to too far by feeling he thinks or was suggesting I'm incompetent?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	39.0	15.0	0.0	0.0
c1wfdp	2019-06-18 02:09:09		AITA for being hurt by not being invited to the ceremony?	"Disclaimer: I will never be vocalizing any of the following to the married couple or the parents.  I don't want to make them feel bad about their special day.  This question is just for my own personal growth.

My husband's young relative recently got married.  We were invited to only the reception.  We were told the ceremony would be immediate family only.  However upon seeing the pictures, it is clear that almost everyone who was at the reception was also at the ceremony which was in the same location right before the reception.  It might have been only immediate family there but most of the couple's friends were also there.

We arrived at the time on the invitation.  It was clear most people had already eaten and some of the food was almost gone.  It felt like we were walking in during the middle of an event.

We do have children but they are older and quite capable of being quiet and well-behaved during a ceremony.

I am a big believer in You-Do-You when it comes to weddings but I think I'd rather not be invited at all than be in that odd situation.  What do y'all think?

c1wddg	2019-06-18 02:03:21		AITA in this argument with my mom?	"I just had this insane dumb argument with my mom. For some reference I am 22 and finishing up my degree and living with my parents rent free. I recently found bug bites on my leg and was worried about bedbugs. 

I went to my mom to ask if she could help me look for them in my bed since I heard they are a nightmare if they infest a home. She refused to help me and she had gotten an attitude immediately at the question I had asked her again if she could because I really don't know what i'm looking for and she refused again.

 I got angry but instead of trying to argue with her I just went back to my room and tried finding the bug that bit me. She then comes into my room and I immediately tell her to leave I don't need her help, quite frankly because I was still annoyed at her reaction and I didn't want to argue with her and was trying to calm down.

 She then comes inside my room anyway and refuses to leave. I then continuously say to leave while she refuses and I just get more upset I start raising my voice. I try to push her out, not forcibly or even remotely with any force to hurt her, and she then says that if I try to push her again she will call the cops on me.

 She then goes on to say that I own nothing in this house and she can be wherever she wants, and that its not my room its hers. She then proceeds to sit on my bed and says she inst going anywhere because its her house and I cant tell her what to do in her house. 

She just left after about an hour of silence because I said I have to study for an exam tomorrow which is true. As she walks out she reiterates that the only reason she is leaving is because I have to study and that's it, and if i'm not studying she will come back with a pillow and cover and sleep in here. 

I think this whole argument is stupid but was I being the asshole here, and is this even normal for parents to react this way? she has been like that my entire life and I can't even tell if I am being the bad guy or not anymore. Any insight Appreciated."	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1wdb7	2019-06-18 02:03:11	MamaPuffin	AITA for not appreciating my friend leaving second hand stuff on my porch?	"A few days ago, my husband got home from work and walked through the door holding a large, full shopping bag and said, ""Why did Anne leave this stuff on our porch?"" I had no idea what he was talking about and I had been home all day and hadn't heard anyone knock. He knew it was from Anne because she had attached an invitation to her little girl's birthday party attached for my DD. In the bag was just random crap she apparently doesn't want-- a few items of kid clothes, a water bottle and chapstick with the logo of the company her husband works for, a single baby bottle, one of those silicone baking sheet liners... 

I text Anne and ask her if she had come by and knocked and I just didn't hear. She says she just left it because she didn't want to disturb us since I have a 3 week old and it was just stuff she found while cleaning. I wanted to be polite so I thanked her and RSVP'd to the birthday party.  

Well today, I open the front door and the wind is blowing and after a while, I hear a clatter of plastic on the porch. I look out and there were three plastic kid sippy cups that had fallen. I don't KNOW that she left them but I don't know who else would have. 

I don't want this to be a ""thing."" I don't really want her stuff and now I feel like I have to ""do"" something with the things she's leaving me. It doesn't help that she and her husband are significantly better off than us so it feels a bit like very weird and undesireable charity. I also don't like crap just sitting on my porch or that she's dropping by unannounced even if she doesn't actually knock. Somehow the not knocking part makes it weirder even though I understand she means well. 

BUT I also feel like I started this by once accepting some clothes and shoes that her daughter had grown out of while I was at her house. Nevermind that she tossed some random packs of tumeric in there too. And I did thank her the last time, which may have further solidified me as her personal Goodwill off-loading site.

I don't like this at all and think it's kind of socially inept but I also feel like I may be being an unappreciative jerk by thinking that. AITA for thinking this is weird? WIBTA for asking her to stop?"	No A-holes here	0	0	109.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

"A couple of weeks ago I was visiting my parents. They have a dog I usually  take for daily walks, so when his treat bucket ran out I decided to walk him down to the local mall to buy a bag of dried pig ears. While trying to find the the entrance that leads straight into the pet store, a girl about 10 years old approached me and asked if she could pet the dog. After a couple of minutes of petting and questions about the dog, her father came over from the parking lot. He didn't recognize me, but I used to be one of he's primary caretakers whenever he was admitted to the psychiatric hospital I worked at a decade ago. I know both his medical and criminal record well, and he has a long history of amphetamine abuse that has resulted in him being forcefully admitted to the psychiatric hospital due to drug induced psychosis almost every other month. He also spent several years in prison for causing multiple car accidents while using amphetamine, and naturally have a lifetime ban on driving.

Now, people do change a lot in 10 years, but not this guy.  He was shaking, face drenched in sweat, excessive chewing and tongue movement, pupils the size of dinner plates, basically all the signs of a large dose of amphetamine/cocaine/mdma. He was stimmed out of his fucking mind. He told me that he had borrowed an old convertible from a friend for the day, and where spending it with his daughter driving around in the area. He continued to ramble on for at least 10 minutes before I managed to leave and go into the pet store. There I got a fucking panic attack thinking about this idiot driving around with his kid in this deathtrap of a car while on drugs. I felt I had to do something, but before I managed to call the police I saw a girl I went to school with for 9 years that I know works as a police officer. Told her what just happened, and since this is a small town with just 7000 people and almost zero crime, she knew exactly who it was. She called it in while we went back outside to see if we could locate the car, which was pretty easy since it was the only convertible in the lot.

I then sat down on a bench on the other side of the road to watch this thing unfold. 30 minutes or so later he came back to the car with his daughter, and he was arrested while trying to pull out of the parking lot exit. The kid was ofc 
having a complete breakdown during all of this, and I feel I am responsible for turning what was probably a ""cool day with dad and his awesome car"" into a fucking nightmare.

A few days later I texted my old classmate on FB asking how everything turned out, but she couldn't tell me anything except that I had made a good call. Still feel like utter shit though.

Note: The fact that I knew about his prior drug abuse, time in prison and no license weighted heavily when deciding to report him, but I never gave this information to the police. I only gave them a description of what I experienced outside the mall."	Not the A-hole	0	0	46.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

It's basically all in the title, I had a $300 Garmin running watch that I bought with my money and my dad lost it when I gave it to him after he told me that it's not a good idea to wear it to cricket training. I have it to him and when I asked for it back he couldn't find it. He said he would replace it (this was 4 months ago now) and I've been reminding him on a monthly basis as he is forgetful. Today was my birthday and a replacement was his gift, I got pissed bc he should of replaced it anyway and he says I'm ungrateful. If it matters we are middle-upper class. Aita here?

c1w1y8	2019-06-18 01:32:01		AITA for being pissed that my kid went camping with my family and came back sunburnt?	"Okay - so I am kind of fanatical about sunscreen, I will admit that.  

This last weekend my parents, and my brothers family (him + wife + 2 kids) all went camping.  We were invited, but we weren’t free, so they offered to take my youngest son with them (he’s 6). We were super grateful, and I was excited for my son to have this experience.

My parents, and my brother and his wife all know how strongly I feel about the kids wearing lots of sunscreen.  We have been on many vacations together where they have seen me constantly slathering my kids up throughout the day.  I just really don’t want them to get a burn.  There is skin cancer in our family, and I’m scared of it.  Plus it hurts.

My mom, is very paranoid about allergic reactions (rightfully so, it’s fine), but she reminded me literally 5 times to remember to pack my sons Epipen. She even called me about an hour before he left to remind me, so at that time it sorta jokingly said “and remember mom - I’m paranoid about sunburns, so please make him wear lots of sunscreen!”.

My sister in law is a pretty diligent sunscreen applier, and her kids have never had a sunburn, as far as I know. So I had confidence that she would be there and would look after my son as well.

We’ll sure enough, after the weekend - my son comes home with a moderate burn on his face, and a fairly bad burn on his neck.  My mom didn’t say anything to me about it.  My sister in law said “I’m sorry about the sunburn! I put sunscreen on him every time I put it on my own kids, I seriously don’t know what happened”.  Her kids were not burnt at all (and they’re equally as pale).  

AITA for being pissed!? My husband thinks I’m majorly over- reacting, and that I should be grateful they took our son camping.  I am grateful, I just feel like they all knew how important this was to me, and they disregarded it.  The way I see it, my son was injured (in a preventable way) in their care, and they’re being very flippant about it.  

I’m annoyed that my mom didn’t take my wishes seriously, even though I explicitly expressed it to her.  I’m annoyed that my sister in law somehow managed to keep her own kids from getting burned, but obviously didn’t take the same care with my son.

"My husband and I have been married a year but together almost a decade. His dad is generally well-intentioned but has a history of making inappropriate comments to his daughters-in-law. He told me ""your tits look good"" on my wedding day and made a reference to me giving him head when we returned from our honeymoon with a souvenir skull as a gift. It made me so uncomfortable that I asked my husband to talk to his dad about it and we all talked and worked it out. Anyways, I found a breast lump and when I told my husband and asked him to respect my privacy and not share anything outside of the two of us until I knew more about the prognosis. He agreed. A few days later I got some abnormal imaging results and ended up needing a biopsy that same day. I called my husband to update him and he left work early to meet me at the appointment. It was a sad and scary day and we went home to wait for the results over the weekend. My husband hung out with his parents that weekend and I asked him again not to share anything with them. He agreed and said of course he wouldn't. Everything ended up being fine, totally benign.  I'm a medical professional and very private in general. I reluctantly told my mom and my sister once I found out everything was okay, but decided not to tell my dad because we're not super close and he didn't need to worry. I asked my husband again not to share anything with anyone else. He agreed and said of course he wouldn't. My husband went on a trip with his dad for Father's Day and I had a feeling he would end up spilling the beans to his dad after some beers. When my husband returned from his trip, I asked him if he told his dad anything about my breast lump. He tried to avoid answering me but eventually admitted he told his dad THE DAY OF MY BIOPSY on his way to meet me at my appointment. My husband then got mad at me for not understanding why he needed to talk to his dad about it. My husband's mom had breast cancer 20 years ago so he felt like his dad would understand how he was feeling. Which I understand, but DUDE I had asked like 5 times not to share info about my breast with his slightly skeevy dad. He told me he wouldn't say anything to anyone even after he had already told his dad. My husband doesn't understand the big deal. Am I the asshole??

She's told me not to apply for In-N-Out, which lead to a fight between us. I've tried to argue that it is a real job with real potential to move up in the company, but she simply doesn't want to listen.

C=Cousin

CL=club

2 weeks ago, C & I decided on meeting his friends in the city. We were in between going out CL’ing or going to bars. I made it pretty clear that even though I wanted to go CLing, I dont have the money for it. I definitely acted excited for a CL night so that’s where I might be TA but I also made it clear it’s just a fun idea & not going to happen. Plans were unclear in pregame, but right before leaving I asked him for final plan since its his friends. He said bars. I had $40 in my wallet. I said cool

In the city we taxi to his friend’s house. He paid for the taxi. He texts his friends & takes a call. He hangs up & says “Never mind we got a table at the CL”. I say “Damn I only have $40. I thought we were going to bar, not CL”. He says “Don’t worry. I got you”. Im thinking thats a lot of money & I feel bad about it but he INSISTS its no big deal. I offer to give him all the money I have but he says to keep it. We get to his friends house. They offer me a line of coke for free. I say yes. We go to the CL

$300 per person for the table. Fun time

Outside were talking. He tells me “thanks for coming out. Tn was fun”. I say “I still really feel bad about not paying for anything tonight” but he says things like “Youre my C. Its all good”

2 weeks pass. I guess he wasnt ok with spending money on me because he asks me for $200. Im thinking “I thought you said it was cool. I’ll give you the money but it’s $200 I wouldnt have spent if you didnt change plans last second”. So Im annoyed but I pay him. Not the first time hes done this to me & others

I complain to my mom about the situation

Mom texts my sister who is hanging out with C at the time “Please pay for your own stuff & dont let C ‘pay’ for anything”. Basically implying “don’t let him pretend he’s spotting you with an expensive bill but he’s going to ask for money later”

I talked to my sister about this too so I’m guessing she explained to C what I said & because it came from my mom, C probably figured out I talked to my mom about the CL

C comes home with my sister while Im in bed & says to me “youre a snitch” & closes the door. Then to my sister he says “I love your brother but when he does shit like this, hes such a faggot”

Hes mad but I brush it off. I feel guiltless. I didnt rat him out, I just vented to my mom & he got his money. In the morning I get a text. “Were not hanging anymore, youre dead to me. Dont text me”. I don’t text him because honestly Im annoyed with him as well. Like I said, not the first time this has happened

I talked to my sister about it for a little & she says that from his perspective, he wishes I would be more appreciative & say thank you. He gave me free coke & basically $100 off for a table at the CL. From my perspective, I got tricked into buying a table at the CL & have no idea what I “ratted him out” about. I never mentioned the coke

Me and A never were best friends or anything but we got along well enough, made the occasional joke or two and that about sums up our precious relationship.
     One night, A was having a bad time, his Grandma was admitted to the hospital and he eventually told us about that. I was trying to be a true gamer and just sent a nice, simple ‘F’ to pay respects.
     It’s safe to say he did not appreciate this. He went off calling me an asshole, cunt, pussy, f*ggot, you name it. I wasn’t having any of it, I don’t really care for insults, but if they’re insulting me for no *good* reason, then that’s just completely ridiculous.
     We argued some more, he insulted me and made fun of things that I was insecure about, I defended myself and repeat until I whip out the good ‘ol mematic.
     Here’s the ‘bad’ part, I made a meme that had the caption “When Your Grandma Has Cancer And Has To Be Admitted To The Hospital” and it detailed a picture of a salt shaker, meaning he was salty.
     Apparently that what I did was ‘despicable’ and ‘hateful’ and I really don’t think what I did is that bad,
     I just made a meme that targeted something he was sensitive about because he was targeting my sensitive spots.

"I live in a complex of several townhouses, over the last few months someone has been smoking quite a bit of very pungent pot. It’s so strong that it completely fills our first floor with the stank and is still quite noticeable in our child’s room on the second floor. It’s to point that we can’t leave our windows open at night because our house will stink. 

For a while I could only say for certain that it was reasonably close to our house, I had no idea who specifically it was. Pot is illegal in our state and I have 0 issues with someone who’s not bothering anyone doing it in their own home. So I really don’t want call the cops. I did however call the office and report it hoping that they would send a letter or something out to scare the person and get them to cut it out. Again I don’t want to get someone arrested I just want to be able to keep my windows open and not have my kid exposed to it. Apparently the office either didn’t act on  my complaint or the people just don’t care.

Tonight I was outside and saw who was smoking. It’s our neighbors who have A few pit-bulls in complete violation of the the lease. I’ve put up with the dogs because they’re usually kept inside and I was trying to  not be a complete ass even though I’ve got very valid reasons for not being happy with that breed. 

Now if I’m conflicted, if I report them again I’m going to report them for everything. This should be enough to get them kicked out. I don’t want to get someone evicted but on the same side I shouldn’t have to put up with this. Secondly if my complex ignores the complaint again, my only option is to escalate it to the cops and I’m really not sure I want to do that."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We have been dating for awhile now and she’s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn’t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn’t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn’t eat much since she’s smaller but I didn’t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can’t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me’s so often though since she’s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don’t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she’s always making sure I’m taken care of and comfortable. I don’t know if I should just suck it up because she’s not taking much from me and if I’d be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?

Edit: wow. I think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. My gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought “haha this reminds me of me and JoyceManner!”, saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me.

I think this whole thing is absolutely ridiculous. It’s my damn console, I shouldn’t be forced to give it up for hours at a time just because my sister decides she wants to play.

I even recommended her asking for her own console since our birthday is coming up, like a 3DS, but my sister shot it down because she “isn’t a seven year old” and my mom says it’s too expensive, even though you can get one on amazon for a little less then 40 bucks.

So since I was 11 (I’m now 18f) was apart of this community online where a bunch of people kinda just talked with each other and we kinda became friends. It’s like one big group chat. There’s this one guy on there, let’s call him Mike. I just met him last year. 
When I graduated high school last year I left this community. Overtime it became toxic and full of drama and just overall bad vibes. So I thought it was a perfect time, I deactivated my account and left after speaking about it a couple times in the chat. I have put out my info and said if anyone wants to contact me they’re free to. 
Only one person did, aka my best friend on there. 

6 months pass and I had only reactivated my account twice to get a photo from there (I couldn’t find it in my gallery) and then the second time was with my best friend to look at old memories of us from when we were kids. After 10 minutes of us going down memory lane I just kinda left my profile open and left. I opened it today to talk to some of the people there and wow the atmosphere had changed. I didn’t know how to talk to anyone or even include myself in anything. People had been exposed for preying on younger members, some people being manipulative, etc. I saw that Mike was online — having talked to him once or twice I popped in to say hi! I missed you, and low and behold he goes OFF on me. He starts saying that I’ve been back “several” times and have never contacted him or “breathed in his direction” now. He started being mean and I felt attacked. Me and mike were never really that close, to be honest, an occasional laugh at each other’s jokes, talking about a band we both liked. We were ‘friends’ but we weren’t best friends. I didn’t know what to say so I said “I’d explain myself but I doubt it matters. My bad for reaching out. Won’t try to again”.

c1vue6	2019-06-18 01:10:28	stlbilly	AITA For eating the last slice of left over pizza that just so happens to be my GF's favorite pizza on the planet.	"Context: We recently visited her favorite pizza place back where she went to college. She truly loves the place as it does have awesome pizza and she worked there for a couple of years during college. This place isn't that close to us, roughly a 90 minute drive from where we live. This is our 2nd time going since we've been dated. We each got a small pizza, and  also got two half-baked pizzas to freeze and eat at a later date. We each eat half of our small pizza, thus leaving 4 pieces (two slices remaining for each person) to get boxed to take home.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 50-ish hours...

&#x200B;

Her last piece has now sat uneaten and has hit the 2-day mark. At no point during our relationship has she ever eaten two day old leftovers. She leaves for an appointment, and boom...I destroy it. She comes home hangry, looks for it, and now I'm the bad guy. I try to defend myself saying ""you never eat two day old leftovers"" to which she reply's ""Why didn't you think I wouldn't eat my favorite pizza on the planet!?"". It's worth noting we both work from home and that pizza could have been eaten at any time.

&#x200B;

So here we are, both now hangry (well, me slightly less hangry), and giving each other the silent treatment.

"I just started a new job that’s basically manual labor for 8 hours a day: moving tanks of concrete solvents and removers to a wooden pallet via buckets. Most of the people I work with are either convicted criminals or recovering addicts (except me and those related to me.) However my boss is neither of these. He apparently owned a bar in town, so he knows business a little bit.

John was just recently promoted to production manager and I think the power is starting to get to his head. My room mate, who also works there, was just recently belittled when John started making fun of how he talked, “Sounds like (room mate) hasn’t even hit puberty yet, sounds so squeaky.” (He went on a few more zingers and walked away). He makes fun of my brother for his weight and keeps saying, “You’re not 6’4 because I’m 6’5.” He’s constantly making fun of David for being there the longest and calling him lazy (though he’s not wrong, but the guy is 61 years old.) He used to make fun of me and how I’m too skinny, but I learned quick I had to just roast him back and he’d stop. Overall, he acts like a douchebag and throws his size around at anyone who thinks they can “stand up to him.” 

This “manager” is employing bully tactics to get his employees to fall in line. He often says something like, “You can’t be friends with your employees. Its like parents thinking they can be friends with their kids.” He promotes fear over love in his leadership. 

He does have a boss, however, and I was considering going to him to tell him what John has been up to as his productions manager, but I want to make sure I’m not the asshole first, just in case he got demoted. Am I being too soft?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1vqs5	2019-06-18 01:00:48	Askin_j	Aita fit wanting to work overtime	"    Ok basically we have two kids one is nine the other is one year, I work a full time job, my wife stays at home. For the longest time she never had a driver's license until last summer, we make good money, but its hard to save up for a car. So recently I was offered a chance to work over time on the weekends, and its incredible money. 

In the past I would pass up over time solely because I wanted time with my family, or because im a human and need time off. I also feel bad because my wife stays home and doesn't have any transportation, I recognize that it sucks, and she needs time away for mental health reasons. 

So since she has her licenses now I decided that maybe with all the overtime we could save enough to have a down payment on a car in a few weeks. At dinner tonight we talked about it, and she was making me feel bad she would be at home with the kids all weekend. 

Since I started to write this we talked more, but I can't help but feel like we would both be making sacrifices and their would be a means to an end. She could have a car to do whatever during the day, and even after school starts back up, it would be whole new world for her. Thanks for reading this, and im not in any way trying to bash my wife, I love her and feel for her, I know its a never ending full time job that's often thankless, I just some unbiased input, thanks."

Okay the current bus is filled with disturbed kids and it makes me feel horrible because seeing a person within that frame of mind permanently wondering what they are thinking just leaves me stunned, 2 kids yell every couple of minutes 1 kid likes to repeat that ""he's the boss"" and ""hush or I'll punish you and put you in the back"" Jesus Christ what the hell man...

My brother is the opposite, everything makes him bored and because of that he's always looking for a new thrill. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, it's what makes him happy and I respect that. My brother, however, does not feel the same. He says he worries about me because I never get out. I tried to explain to him that going out everyday and being surrounded by people like he is all the time would make me miserable, he doesn't understand.

Note that this isn't a one off thing, it seems like every time we talk now he goes off on this. He's blamed my behavior on my depression, said he hated how ""content"" I was. I work on my art for hours, every day constantly trying to improve my technique, if there's anything I'm not it's content. 

It would be a nice thing that he's worried about me if he hadn't proven time and time again to always have alterer motives. I really don't think my brother cares about me, I think he preaches to inflate his own ego. That being said I might be wrong.

We were arguing about it again, and I abruptly ended the conversation by saying he needed to learn to empathize with people and that our mentalities were just different, that's all.

This doesn't seem like much without the context, but my brother has had extreme difficulty with empathy his whole life, we all know it, he knows it, he's never addressed it. I guess he's scared to. I don't really feel that bad, what I said shut him the fuck up and let me exit the conversation without another word. Though I might just be blinded by anger, AITA for saying that?  


Note: I know there are some issues with my life style and I'm working on them, I'm trying to exercise more along with trying to get more sunlight, my brother's points are only to do with my social life, I also have friends just a tight nit group that I'm very close with."

c1vn0w	2019-06-18 00:50:17		AITA for not wishing my dad a Happy Father's Day?	"CONTEXT: I am gay and I came out to my dad about a year ago. I knew he would struggle having a gay son, but I thought he would come around by now since nothing about me has changed except for the fact that he knows I like boys.

SINCE THEN: After coming out to my dad, he told me he thought gay people are weird and that I was unnatural for being gay. He has gone as far to tell me that I'm gay because our family has a history of bad genes and used homosexuality and incest as an example of the bad genes that our family carries. I ignored these comments because I knew they were coming from an ignorant place.

3 MONTHS AGO: My dad and I were hanging out while I was reading a story about a guy that got disowned and kicked out of his parent's house for being gay. I began telling my dad this story and was going to thank him for being accepting of who I am, but before I could finish, he cut me off. He began telling me that I have a problem and that I am not natural. I asked him how could I have a problem if it can't be fixed? He replied by saying that a kid can be born with down syndrome, but you can't fix down syndrome. My dad was drinking when he told me all of this, he's an alcoholic, but it really hurt listening to him tell me that being gay is comparable to someone that has a mental disability.

A COUPLE DAYS LATER: After that night, I avoided my dad. I was really hurt by what he said and didn't want to be around him. In the following days, my dad and my mom got in to an argument. I don't like when my parents fight in front of me, so I usually intervene and tell them to stop. He was sober, so I took the opportunity to call him out on what he said to me the other night. He denied everything he said. He's struggles admitting when he's wrong. Now the argument is between my dad and I. He finally admitted to what he said and that it didn't matter what he said while he was drunk because he was that kind of person all the time; even when he's sober.

SINCE THEN: I have not had a conversation with my dad since that day. Every exchange we've had since that day has been one word answers or simple phrases. He has not apologized for what he had said to me. My mom suggested to my dad that he should talk to me, but he refused because he believes did/said nothing wrong. It's been so long that my mom thinks I should just get over it and that I shouldn't take my dad's words to heart because he always says stupid stuff. I should just tolerate some of the shitty things he says to me because he's my dad and I should be happy that I have a dad because there are much worse dads out there and some who don't even have a dad. So I have now become the ungrateful one in my parents eyes for not getting over the homophobic comments my dad made to me months ago.

The best man decided to not invite me to the secret bachelor party due to an injury and the partying environment . I had to learn to walk again and require a brace in my shoe to do so now. I wasn’t invited because there would be drugs and alcohol, (something I have to be careful with) and it would be difficult with my injury. 

I ended up healing really fast and I have had a salaried job for months that I’m kicking ass at. I have also been sober. The groom called me up saying he felt guilty because he was so proud of how I turned around my life and that he didn’t want me to “see snapchat” and think they went without you behind your back. 

 I told him it was no big deal, that I understood the best man’s decision to not invite me. To be fair, I was stuck in bed for months and in severe pain so I know the decision was made in good faith. The groom didn’t know till last month when he was told the details of his bachelor trip.

AITA for being upset for not being able to get the option to go on the bachelor trip? Im healthy and financially stable and the groom didn’t know I wasn’t invited till the trip was already booked.

It is one of the worst towns in terms of crime in the state we live in. We moved away when he was 12, to a very rich town with a very good school. He complained about the lack of diversity in his new school(he is indian), but his father and I ignored him and thought he would get used to it. This town me moved to is pretty much always in the news for a racist incident, but we thought he would be fine because the racist incidents were usually towards black people, not indian people. Also, we need to move to this town because the school is very good. In the beginning of this year, before school started, he was begging us to move back to his old town. We said no. Over the course of the year, he would ask to hang out with his friends from his old school, but we would say no. His father and I think he should be hanging out with people who will actually go somewhere in life. Friday was his last day of school.  Today, he asked me if he could hang out with his best friend from his old school next thursday. I said no. I explained to him how these kids who grow up dirt poor in neighborhoods with a lot of crime will never be anything in life, and he should be hanging out with people who will end up doing something in life. I also explained to him that there would be no parental supervision, as this kids parents are probably trashy, uneducated people who do not care about rules. He told me that his friend was a straight a student, and that his parents were really smart people who had gone to college. I told him he couldn't go anyway, and he got very angry. AITA?

"I see a lot of posts on this subreddit where the answer to a lot of questions along the lines of ""AITA for not wanting to see/reconcile with my child as an adult for (reasons)"" is a resounding yes, you're the asshole, stop punishing your adult child. 

I disagree with this for two reasons: 

1. If the roles were reversed and the child didn't want to see their parent for whatever reason, the answer is usually always ""just because you're blood doesn't mean you owe them anything"" and people seem to respect that even though you are related, if you don't want to see someone, you don't have to see them. Even if they're your parent. 

2. Surely, if the parent does not want to be friends with their child, it would be better for the child's mental health for them both just not to see each other? Instead of the parent forcing themselves to be around the child and possible resentment or discomfort passing to the child and affecting their mental health worse than if the parent just wasn't present to begin with. 

I say this as a pregnant woman who would never refuse to see her child, and as a child who has a good relationship with her Dad and his fiancee, but hasn't seen her mother in years due to personal choice.

c1vj6w	2019-06-18 00:39:24		AITA for being frustrated with my friend for exposing me as something I am not (Weaboo)?	"Firstly, as a pre-warning before you continue reading this, this is a dumb subject (anime) for this subreddit, but it has been bothering me. I’m sorry if it is not suited for this subreddit. 

I am a teenage girl, and I think I could call myself a hardcore anime fan. I have one friend - let’s call her S - at school that knows about this (casual anime fan herself), and today she decided that she was going to tell one of our other friends in my ‘friend group’ (people I am allowed to hang out with)  about this. So S decides that she is going to tell this person test I am a weaboo, and that I try speak Japanese and that all I do is watch anime and so on. If you don’t know what a weaboo is, it is a term that usually describes (this is not an exact definition, just my knowledge but it’s pretty accurate) someone who is overly obsessed with Japan, Japanese culture, and anime etc. Traditionally, they stereotypically insert Japanese into every sentence, go on about anime all the time, and don’t stop being cringey about how Japanese culture is superior to others. 
While I would say that I am a huge fan of anime, I by no means talk Japanese or intensely idolise Japanese culture in an obsessive way. S doesn’t even talk to me about anime that much, so I don’t know where she came up with this from. 
So we are standing there at school, and S starts rambling on to this friend of ours about how I am a weaboo and how I ‘speak Japanese all the time’. Said friend asks what a weaboo is, and S explains it similar to the way I did above, saying that I am that. There I am, hurriedly trying to make excuses as S is literally trashing me and talking in a serious, non joking way to them while this friend is just looking at me weirdly. I kind of brush it off because I don’t want to jeopardise my friendship with S over a small thing, as this is the only ‘mean’ thing she has done to me. I say ‘mean’ because the way she was explaining it was quite rude and when she was saying my name it was like she was disgusted.
Anyway, so I try to brush it off. Fast-forward to when I am home from school, and after pondering it and just getting myself more worked up I drop S a text message asking if she was joking when she ‘exposed me’. She said she wasn’t joking, meaning that she was completely serious. This just made me more upset because at this point I don’t think the friend that she told this all to will think of me the same again.

I am sorry for anything that does not make sense. I know this is really dumb, and I just read over it and realised how stupidly immature it sounds but I just want some closure/reassurance over whether I should be frustrated with her for doing this."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

However, my mom has a 95-pound shepherd mutt who’s been nothing but problematic... As a puppy, he was great. Social and sweet, but somewhere along the line, something snapped in him. He is friendly to his family, but will growl and bark and snap in crowds. 

Things took a turn for the worse two months after I had my son. We went over for a visit, and before we could even take our coats off, this dog shoved past us, put his nose into the car seat, and snapped at the blanket covering him. We left immediately. I was under the impression the dog would have been put away before we came in, but even after he had been locked behind a gate, he was growling and trying to get past it.

My mom recently moved into a larger home, and insisted we try to come over one more time. She had him behind a heavy duty gate. I was bouncing and playing with my son, and he was squealing. The dog started up again, snarling and barking. My mom told me to... stop playing with my son and be calmer... being calm and quiet isn’t exactly in a baby’s skill set.

A couple weeks back I suggested to my mom that maybe she should rehome him. This dog is taking over her life. She says she can’t be away from home more than two days in a row because it will upset him. The dog will attack her other two dogs if they get more attention than him. She has spent over $1000 on his medicines and psychiatry appointments for him (I kid you not... A dog psychiatrist.)  She previously put him through a $500 training course.

I understand loving an animal, but this is extreme. My mom, sister and father vehemently defend their decision to keep the dog. Saying that no one else would take in a dog with special needs, and that he’d inevitably be put down. But I think if he had a house where it was just him, no other pets and no kids, he would be much happier. And if not... maybe he should be put down if he’s that much of a threat to people.

I don’t want to take my son over to their house anymore at this point. Am I the asshole for telling my mom that the dog needs to go?

EDIT: The dog has injured her other pets in the past as well, including tearing open one of her dogs eyes, breaking another’s legs and trying to bite her parrot.  (More in comments below.)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	10.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

I moved to another country and my apartment was empty so I allowed him to move in without paying rent with the condition of not redecorating it because it was still mine.
He redecorated immidiately because he is a designer.
When I came back to visit for two weeks I noticed that my room was redecorated and full of arts and crafts on every piece of furniture and there was no place for me to put my clothes so I kept them in the suitcase.
Sunday night I got anxious and moved his arts and crafts out of my room and I created a mountain of papers and decorations that felt like living with a hoarder, being myself a minimalist, so I put that on the street because I couldn’t find a place for it in my tiny apartment.
He got furious and my entire family sided with him and called me an asshole because I could have asked him nicely to stop hoarding my apartment, as if hoarder would listen when you just ask them nicely.

I gave birth 15 months ago to a beautiful baby girl. She’s always been hairy. It’s nice in a way because she was born with hair on her head and she has really full eyelashes. But she also developed a  unibrow. It was light at first. But over the last 4-5 months, it’s gotten fairly  prominent. 

For aesthetic reasons, I decided to pluck it while she slept. If she woke up I would stop. I managed to get it all off in a couple days. 

I didn’t really think of this as being a bad thing. But a fellow mom friend of mine (meaning a friend IRL) stopped by for a “play date” a few days ago. She’s an extremely observant person and she mentioned my daughter’s eyebrows. I was honest and said I plucked the middle while she slept. She had this horrified look and said she was surprised that I did that. I didn’t really know what to say, but obviously I felt a little insecure about my decision after that. 

I’ve talked to my husband and he says I’m overthinking this, but I don’t know. 

Honest feedback welcome, obviously.

**Edit for emphasis: As I said in my post, my daughter is 15 months. Over a year. The hair darkened in the past few months but that is not her age. Not that it really matters but I keep seeing people call her a newborn and an infant which she is not.**"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Her bf started doing  suspicious things that led us to think he was about to try to get custody of their mutual child.  Husband warns me of what he observed,  I warn sister. 
Sister verbally attacks me and husband, he calls her a bad word while walking out the front door.  She takes fireplace tongs outside and hits him repeatedly.  He gets them out of her hands,  she keeps attacking,  he gets her on the ground with hands behind her back. 
Police called, my mom begs him not to press charges since bf would definitely get the kid.  So he doesn't. 

We move out. Her bf filed for custody,  but they ended up dropping the case and getting pregnant again. She cuts me out of her life. My father's side of the family is told by her that he beat her, so they all cut me out too.

She was willing to send a group text to brag about her new jobs, or to ask for favors but won't reply to messages or anything

2.5 years later, I've sent letters,  messages through family,  etc, but they keep saying  shes ""not ready"" to see me or talk to me.

Today I get a message from our mutual sisters to come visit her,  because she's 'in a good mood' 
I say Husband will be home soon, we will be there. 

I get told,  no, not him,  she doesn't want to see him.

his eldest kid who is 7 years old has started acting more girly (he is a boy) and I worried that my brother could do something.

But when I was 7 years old I used to be really close friends with a kid who (from what I remember) had autism. 
We used to walk around the field during recess and lunch looking for cool rocks and talking about dinosaurs and stuff like that. 

Our school had 3 different playgrounds, one for grade 1+2, one for grade 3+4 and one for grade 5+6. One day the swing set at the grade 3/4 playground was free so I took my chance to swing because I was in grade 2 and the 1/2 playground didn’t have swings. 
While I’m swinging my friend comes up to me and asks if we can look for rocks and I straight up told him no because I want to swing. 
I don’t remember ever hearing from Him again after that.

 I come close and ask if everything is alright before he walks inside. He did come back out later to grab something from his car but all I did was look over to see if he was going to take another picture or recording. We've never had a problem with this neighbour before.


I was on the phone with my mother and she said ""just leave it be as he's looking for something to complain about."" But just him coming out taking a picture without telling me what the issue was isn't sitting with me. I'm planning on going over and saying exactly this

He began to tell me that his roomies told him he had until 9pm to pack everything and gtfo from the apartment because he didn't clean enough, in his defense he said that he spent a most of the time out and rarely slept at the apartment and that he didn't clean much often but he certainly did. I didn't care about the details and offered him to stay at my apartment for a while until he got another place to stay, he was a bro in need so I wanted to help.

Then I knew why was he kicked out.

My apartment is small and a bit messy, not much tho, but with him in living there crumbs of bread were everywhere, he had a lot of his stuff spread around and another things.

Eventually he found another place and left, he asked if he could pick up his thing another day because he was unable to carry all at once, I thought it was ok but I didn't realize hlw many of his things would be around here, some bed sheets, boxers, gross stuff like dirty used socks, and used q-tips (wtf dude)

After he left I cleaned the house and put his things in a big plastic bag, the next week u asked him when could he pick up his stuff, and he would say one day, when that day arrived he would say *oops I forgot"" and move to another day, this would continue for a while. Finally he stayed at my house onde night after a party and picked up some of his stuff, buy still left a lot.

The days passed, became weeks and he only showed up one day to pick up one specific item, I told him "" you motherfucker take everything that is yours"" he said he couldn't because he was going to X place, that he would be here on Saturday, that day came, didn't show up, then he said Monday, same story, so I told him that of he didn't came this week I'll be throwing away his shit and giving it to the homeless."

c1vaog	2019-06-18 00:16:25	away_thy_ist_thrown	AITA for being terrified/disgusted by little kids?	"When I was in middle school an autistic kid yanked my glasses off my face and I just quietly asked the person taking care of him to get them back for me. They opted to finish what they were doing first (like 5 minutes) and then go find the kid and convince him to give the glasses to her (like 10 minutes). I was terrified I would be called out for being mean to an autistic kid (I wasn’t, I was just standing there waiting for someone else to give me a bag of soil for Enviro Science farm and the kid walked up), and I’m also nearsighted so I couldn’t really see a thing and felt vulnerable. When I got the glasses back there was a big streak of snot over one lens (btw, I was a germaphobe too!) and I could hear/sorta see the blurry outline of the kid laughing at me from a few feet away. I opted to put it in a ball of napkins and deal with blindness instead of touching it and cleaned it best I could when I got home.

Fast forward to now. Anytime I see a little kid I feel like they’re going to grab/break my glasses or hurt themselves in my presence and I’ll take the blame for it. Or they’ll break something or do -something- out of my control that I won’t know how to handle. Anytime a little kid grabs my arm or something it feels cold and sweaty and slimy and I just imagine them swiping snot off onto me.

Two of my older half-sisters brought their little kids today and I just hid in my room the entire time they were here. The kids were loud and actually broke a few things and that didn’t exactly help because I convinced myself that my hiding was justified. Even when they left I stayed in my room until my mom called me and told me to eat. I can’t touch anything now. I can’t eat anything that isn’t sealed. I feel like a coward and a jerk for being scared and disgusted by my family’s kids. My mother told me how my sisters felt I was being stuck-up and that I must hate children. I don’t -hate- them necessarily but it’s a perfectly reasonable conclusion to jump to seeing as I only saw them once and then ran back to my room ASAP. 

Little kids are the only things that make me go into germaphobe mode again.

My family intentionally did not tell me my aunt was hospitalized until only a few hours before she passed.

For context, I moved out of the country last August for a work opportunity. I knew my aunt, who was like a true second mother to me was not in a good condition because she had recently started living by herself and her piece of shit son never helped her. But not to where she would pass.

Only a few weeks after my move my family called me to tell me my aunt had been in the hospital for a day or two and she had slipped on a coma. Shortly after, she passed and they called me after.  I could not take a flight back because o had no money or time off from my job.

It has taken close to a year to process this; but it has just come to my mind that they purposely denied me the chance to talk to her or say goodbye at least on the phone. Their reason for not telling me until the end was that I was dealing with the stress of moving to this new country. But, I feel completely betrayed by everyone in my family. They knew how much she meant to me and how much one conversation or goodbye would mean to me.

&#x200B;

So I've got this friend that I share a few college classes with. He sits next to or behind be in all of them. When the weather starts changing, he will bring in a box (or usually a few of those small travel packs) of tissues and blow his nose during the class session. This doesn't just happen once or twice a class, though. I have counted before (because I've been so disgusted and distracted by him) and he will sometimes blow his nose 20-30 times in a 50-minute class session. He goes through a pack of tissues and will put the dirty ones back in his bag, presumably because he doesn't want to get out of his seat to throw them away because he doesn't want to disturb the class. Sometimes it is so distracting that I just want to tell him how disgusting it is to hear him constantly blowing his nose in the middle of class while the professor is teaching and students are trying to listen. I've always thought that surely I'm not the only one that finds this gross, but I haven't actually discussed this with anyone. I always figured it was just one of those things that goes untalked about, but everyone agrees is disgusting.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, he can't help that his nose is constantly running, and leaving class every few minuets to blow your nose in the bathroom is unreasonable because he needs to be present for the lecture, so what can you say? I've also started second guessing myself. Am I the only one that finds this gross and rude? I know he can't help it, but damn, there is a class going on and he is the only one in the room doing this. Do I just need to chill the fuck out and let the man blow his nose, or do other people see this as rude as well?"	Asshole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"Dead r/AmITheAsshole , I'd just want a third person POV on this matter because it's been bugging my mind for quite a while.

My father used to be a very kind man (imo). He'd treat both me and my sister with warmth and love. He used to always read bedtime stories to us, take us to family outings with my mother and was a really fun father in general.

When I was about 10 things started to change. Long story short he stared to argue alot with my mother. His reason was that he'd been extremly stressed with work and didn't agree with my mother. I'd hear them arguing daily. This is when he stared to spend less time with me and my sister.

When I was 13 he started to project his anger on me and my sister. Long story short he gave me a very low self esteem, I was emotionally and mentally not well. I dare say it was the lowest point of my life. 

When I was almost 15 my father decided to station at another countrt because of work and his medical condition. This I understand that it's not his fault since he would now take his time to travel and see us a a couple times each year. 

When I was almost 16 I recovered from the lowest point in my life so far. After I left my father i started to harbour hatred for him and had no wishes to ever see him again. When he vists us I'd ignore him and give him curt replies. Sometimes I'd talk back at him occationally but I will not raise my voice. When I do talk back at him he'd always tell me ""you have no right to speak to me like that I'm your father"" but the thing is he hasn't been acting like one for the last few years. I had the courage to ask him why he projected his anger at me. He told me this:

""It saddens me thinking abt it. I love you just as much if not more. At the time when I scolded you it was ripple effect from urging with ur mom. I always wanted all of us to live together like every other families. It was ripple effect. I hv regretted for a long time. It weighs very heavily in my heart. I was equally hurt. You are always siding ur mom not knowing the whole truth which you need to at times. Right or wrong there are always 2 side of a coin."" 

Why would I take his side when he affected my emotional health and mental health negatively?

Yes, he does wish to make ammendments with me however I do not wish to. I still treat him with respect but I just dont see him as my father anymore. I have never raised my voice against him. I haven't been projected my anger towards him. As of right now I don't feel any hatred towards him. When he asks about how im doing and how my studies are, I'd reply along the lines of ""yeah Im fine"" ""yes exam period is starting soon and I'm prepared"" but i don't try to continue the conversation.

 I have forget the horribe words he's spoken to me and acknowledged that he's regretful of his actions. I speak to him normally and I do show respect for him.

c1v3za	2019-06-17 23:58:13	Temporary2139	AITA for changing my mind about ending a friendship?	"I had these 3 very close female friends, let's call them C, P and H (I'm 21F) who I've known since childhood.
I went through an abusive relationship, he read all my messages and bullied me to stay at uni and never see my friends. (He would get violent with me for talking to them). 
My friends told me I wasn't pulling my weight as a friend. Obviously they didn't know what I was going through but it was really painful and I only had my abusive boyfriend telling me I wasn't bad (ironically) so it kind of meant I was further isolated.

After I left my ex, I was in a bad place and had a lot of feelings about my traumatic experience. I didn't go into gory details but I talked to my friends on our group chat (where we talked all the time) about how I was feeling; I guess I just wanted their sympathy. We always told each other everything. 

They started to not respond to my messages and would often leave me on read.
They told me that I should get counselling (I had) and that they didn't want to hear about my stuff anymore. I understood that they needed to take care of their mental health but it was difficult to hear. 

I wanted to be honest and tell them that I had found it tough when they said I wasn't being a good friend. 
We had a falling out, but I wanted to patch things up so I decided I was still going to C's birthday party. 
A week before it, she texted me and said she didn't want me there, that she wanted to have a nice party. I said that was rude and she said I could think that if it helped me.

A year later, things haven't improved much. I've been diagnosed with PTSD so I'm rather anxious a lot of the time and I kept thinking that C had hurt me but I didn't know how to deal with it. 

After a lot of thought I messaged P and H and said I didn't want to be friends with C anymore. I explained my reasons in as kind a way as possible. After, I realised that I actually didn't want to end the friendship with C - somehow telling them had made things clearer. 
I told P and H this - H was delighted at the news. P asked why the quick turnaround, I was honest, said I'd had a new diagnosis and realised I needed to reduce the stress I was putting myself under. She did not reply.

I asked if I could visit with them at their shared house over the summer.
Now I've had a message from P saying she doesn't want to be close to me again because she didn't like how I could 'so easily' decide to stop being friends with C. Also, she told C that I had been thinking about ending the friendship, even though I didn't want her to. It was anything but an easy decision - I am an anxious person so I thought about it for months before I acted. I've been an emotional wreck since I got that message earlier today. I have known P since I was born, I can't imagine life without her. I feel so guilty, my mind is racing. AITA?

We used to live in a real big city, similar to Los Angeles, so there's a lot of people here. I still live in the big city with over a million people in the population, but my friend has since moved to the east in a reaaaal small town with maybe 5,000 people in it? Now when living in the city, she slept with a lot of different people. I don't have a problem with it, she takes care of herself and gets tested. My problem is the details she gives out in a group chat. Things like, ""He was cute, but too short."" ""I liked him, but I don't think he likes me."" and if she decides to stay over the night, I'll wake up to messages like ""He didn't know where my clit was."" ""His dick was too small for me and I didn't cum."" Since moving away, it's changed to ""My vibrator broke and I cried."" ""These small-town boys don't know anything about fucking and how to make a girl cum."" ""So and so back from the city was really great at fucking but he didn't want a relationship with me, what a fuckboy."" It's really starting to get to me, because I just don't want to hear about other's sex lives. It's none of my business and I don't want it.

The reason I borrowed his car is because my car wouldn’t have made the trip and his is much newer. 

Today we returned  each other’s cars and the first thing I noticed were TWO chalk marks on my tires. For those of you who may not know, this is a method for parking enforcement to check if a car has gone over the time limit in a parking area. I preceded to ask him if he got any tickets and he said he didn’t because he made it back in time. Once I got inside my car, there was a lot of trash and drink stains everywhere which really frustrated me because I actually took the time to clean his car (including his mess) before returning it to him.

c1v12t	2019-06-17 23:50:46	ragdollnamedluna	AITA for wanting my mom to decide if she wants a new phone or not?	"My mom is on my phone plan. She takes advantage of a $5 discount for being a secondary line, and we share 8GB of data (she doesn't use much of it). Our lines come up for renewal on alternating years (important). Also important, she hardly ever uses her phone. It sits in her purse for days on end and she only takes it out when she realizes she's missing getting texts on her iPad because her phone is dead, or when we're out and I call her. As a result, her battery health is still above 85%, even after 4 years. It's an iPhone SE.

Last summer I wanted to try out the new Galaxy S9 and I was going to buy out my contract to do it. My mom said she was fine with her phone and didn't need a new one, so I could have her device upgrade. I made sure she was okay with that and accepted, and she could have mine this year. I ended up selling my old phone and making a small profit on the whole exchange.

Now my line is coming up for renewal. I asked last week if she's looked at the new line-up and if there are any phones that she's interested in. She said no she hasn't. Today I asked again, and told her that my line is up for renewal in 2 weeks.

She flippantly asked if I wanted it, and I was honest. I told her that if she wants it, it's hers, but if she's still happy with her phone, I'm just going to sit on month-to-month until one of us finds a phone they like. But I would like her to make a decision so that I know whether or not I'm renewing my contract now or later, and whether or not I can take a look myself at the lineup.

Now she's basically determined that I'm selfish for asking her to make a choice.

c1v0tw	2019-06-17 23:50:05	Trashaccount13131313	AITA because I won't ride roller coasters?	"TL;DR My fiance is mad at me because he sees me not going to a theme park as a direct insult to his love of being an adrenaline junkie. 

I've had of fear of riding rollercoasters ever since I rode one when I was about 12 and wasnt buckled in correctly. I slid from my seat and hit my head in the side of my seat. I needed up cutting up right above my eye pretty bad, had to get off the roller coaster with blood all over my face and clothes. Paramedics where called and I had to go through the process of getting fixed up, doing a report, and going to the doctor afterwards. It was horrible, I ended up with a nasty cut but that was about it. 

Now my fiance is an adrenaline junkie and when we first started dating he asked me to do a pretty easy one. I agreed but ended up backing out. He says I strung him along which I did, I've apologized, and have never done it again. But he says the only way for me to redeem myself is for me to go ride the original rollercoaster I backed off from riding. He asked me to go skydiving for his bachelor party and I said no and he immediately took it offensively. Saying that he felt more ready to jump into a life with me but he wasnt sure i was ready because of me saying no to skydiving. Saying that doing stuff like riding roller coasters and skydiving would be more meaningful if I did it too. Hes comparing my commitment to us as a couple to my willingness to face my fears. 

Im frustrated and mad because I've never stopped him from doing anything like that. I was hesitant to agree on him skydiving right before we get married and even said ""what if you die"" because it does cross my mind but I've never forbidden it nor would I. He keeps telling me I need to do it for him or for us but it's a huge fear of mine and I'm honestly terrified. And I think its completely unfair for him to connect how much I love him to doing something adrenaline related. 

other things he said to make his point was that its important to him that we do this specifically. Otherwise he feels like hes ""on an outside cave"" where he can be near me but not be ""inside"". Like not doing this for him would mean that I always keep him at an arms length.

&#x200B;

Backstory: Me \[53/m\] and my wife \[49/f\] made the tough decision to kick out our adult son \[25/m\]. This is not without reason, and we have given him multiple notices and enough time to sort things out and save money, find an apartment, devise a budget, and figure out what he wants to do. He went to a local college as soon as he finished high school, but dropped out after 2.5 years after switching his major three times: from graphic design, to accounting, to biology. After dropping out, he worked at a local deli department for about two years until he was fired. Our son has ADD, but is otherwise incredibly bright and friendly. At times he gets overloaded and has had many incidents of not properly filling out customer orders or being too slow. Me and my wife sympathized and encouraged him to look for something else. This was three years ago, and our son has not worked at all. He has not put even the slightest bit of effort into finding a job or returning to school. He has become overweight and spends all his time in front of the computer or playing video games. It got to a point where I had to sit him down and explain that he needs to look for a job, because me and my wife are planning on downsizing to a smaller house and will be unable to support him. He never took our conversations seriously. My wife would talk to him several times a week about job applications, only for him to go ""Oh, mom..."" and ignore her. I've sat him down, and tried to reason with him. I was willing to give him a few years to save up money so he would have a safety net to fall back on, but still nothing. He claims to suffer from depression, and while I can see that, I felt that it would be better for him to try and face the world head on. He's seen psychiatrists, has been on multiple medications, and will need his own insurance next year. I became so frustrated with him that I finally felt enough was enough. I woke him up, packed his bags, and drove him to a homeless shelter. I told him that he needs to find a job, and that me and his mom would not let him back into the house until he has one. I gave him all the essentials: razors for shaving, soap, deodorant, toothbrush kit, and etc. I kept his belongings in storage and would unpack them if he came home.

It has been over a month, and we hadn't heard from him or seen him. He has no friends that we know of, so we thought it was unlikely that he would be staying with anyone. I then receive a call from of our neighbors, who then told me they saw our son, with a scraggly beard and unkempt hair, walking around aimlessly near a shopping center, before hunching himself over beside a building. I cannot believe what I heard. I drove back up there to check if he was still there, but I couldn't find him. He has no phone or means for us to contact him. I am now feeling extremely worried that this was not a good decision. Am I the asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c1uzxt	2019-06-17 23:47:34		AITA for cutting off my aunt and not attending my grandma's birthday party?	"Throwaway because this is a personal matter. And sorry in advance for the long story.

My aunt is a horrible human being. She is the phoniest person I have ever met. She acts all nice to your face and will badmouth you behind her back to my grandma. I love my grandma, but she can be very manipulative (think Marie Barone) and always takes my aunt's side. My aunt is also super lazy. She has two kids and basically dumps them off on my grandparents a lot, even though she doesn't work and is married (to a lazy alcoholic), and complains about how ""tired"" she is, even though all she really does is get her hair and nails done. (For reference, I'm 21 and she's only ~10 years older than me, so in a lot of ways she's more akin to a cousin than an aunt.)

We've never gotten along that well, but on a recent family event it got kind of ugly. Her kid was licking a serving spoon and repeatedly putting it back into the dish. She just sat there like nothing was wrong. I usually bite my tongue, but in this instance I told her that she should tell him to stop because it was disgusting and unsanitary. She then tried to make me out like the bad guy and told me that I ""shouldn't have kids if I can't handle it"". That was the last straw. After that, I walked out of the house and vowed that I would never see her, her alcoholic husband, or her bratty kids ever again. (Her and her husband are typically drunk at most family events and it only adds to my dislike of them since they make stupid comments.) I had considered cutting them off when I moved out of my parents' house, but this cemented it for me.

I stopped attending any family event that she and her kids were at, and it seems to be a positive choice thus far. (She drives me crazy, and I have had mental health issues in the past, so I try to remove any ""toxic"" things from my life when possible. One time a couple of years ago at a different family event, she insinuated that I was making fun of her behind her back and cried to get attention. I, in fact, wasn't talking about her or any family member for that matter.)

Next month is my grandma's 75th birthday, and my mom assumed I would be going to her party. I told her no, because of the above reasons, and she told me I was being a brat. My mom has never gotten along with my aunt either, but she said I have to 'suck it up' for my grandma. I know my grandma will be upset that I'm not attending, but I just can't bring myself to be around my aunt.

During one of our games two guys came and wanted to join us. I’m not a darts pro or anything but I’m better than the average player. To not ruin the fun for anyone I didn’t try my hardest and just tried to have some fun. 

After the game was finished one of the other people starting ranting about how much better he was than everyone in the bar. It was kind of funny for the first 45 minutes, but after that I got annoyed and asked if he wanted to play again but for money. The bet was the loser pays $200 and pays for all the drinks the four of us had consumed. 

After I had won but the other guy started yelling that I hustled him and he wasn’t going to pay and a few other not nice words. 

I frequent the bar we went to and the owner said I could come back tomorrow to pay my tab because he was making such a big scene. I came back the next day to find out he had charged the entire order to his card. My friend thinks I was wrong for making it about money and just not letting it go but I was just drunk and fed up.

c1uy7r	2019-06-17 23:42:56	ta_nomoneyguy	WIBTA if I didn’t help my wife with our financial obligations because she gave money to her sister (my SIL)	"

A little background info first:

My  40+ y/o SIL lives with my wife, me, and our three children. She moved in with us approx. 7 years ago because she had some serious medical problems, serious as in she was in an induced coma for about 3 months. We let her move in so she could be taken care of while she recovered and got back on her feet. She was back at work full time 3 years ago.

Since then every time my wife and I talked about telling her it’s time to find a place on her own, something would come up that has extended her stay. For example, she was being garnished for her medical bill (she has since claimed bankruptcy so that isn’t happening anymore) and another time she lost her job. She did move out once with her BF of 6 months just to break up with him and my wife let her back in (without consulting with me cause she knew I’d support her decision anyways).

So now, what has been happening is SIL won’t have the money to pay us rent/utilities/food etc. it has happened about 3-4 times in the past 1-2 years. What ends up happening is my wife says “husband, SIL can only give us $400 instead of the $1000” so wife and I take $300 out of each of our own pockets to cover her. It does put a hinder on what we can and cannot do for ourselves and our children. Also I want to put out there SIL make more money than wife or I. I have spoken to my wife about this on several occasions and it just ends up in a fight. Her argument is we don’t have a choice but to cover it because our mortgage and childcare need to be paid. Which is true, but in my head I’m like “yea, but I don’t have to cover it, she’s not my sister” I’m pretty non-confrontational so I don’t put up much of a fight.  

So here comes the WIBTA part...

I want to tell my wife I can’t cover it anymore, not that I won’t cover it, but I can’t cover it anymore. But if I do that then the whole $600 is left on my wife to cover. Since my wife can’t seem to pull the trigger to have her sister leave, I’m thinking hurting her wallet would. If anything, at least I’ll have extra spending money for me (yes, selfish) and our children. Now, i do understand if she isn’t there then we’d have to cover the whole $1000, but I’d rather do that then pay for $600 and have my SIL live with us. I do want to support my wife in anything and everything she does, but this doesn’t feel like I’m supporting her, feels like I’m supporting SIL. 

I’m feeling this would fall under ESH, but hoping to get a NTA. I’ll continue to help with a YTA or ESH."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She invited her father and his wife to come stay with us - for presumably one night only. However they stay two of the three nights we are there. To top it off, we’re in a really cute Airbnb cabin with one main room and one loft. My in-laws ask that since they have their dog and are older if they can take the main room and we take the loft. Am I the asshole for getting irritated with my wife for not telling her dad to pound sand and only stay one night? Not to mention, his wife is mildly annoying.	Not the A-hole	0	0	26.0	7.0	0.0	0.0
c1uxul	2019-06-17 23:42:01		AITA for not talking to my mom after she accidentally ruined a deer head I was going to mount?	"Before I start the story, I want to say that I'm autistic and because of that I become very passionate/fixate on things. I'm not using that as an excuse, it's just for insight as to why I reacted so severely and blew stuff out of proportion. I'm also a minor, that's why my mom is involved. 

So, my uncle gave me a dried up deer head because I mentioned to him how I wanted to mount a deer skull. I was ecstatic to get one and couldn't wait to start to clean it. I was going to clean it basically by pulling it in a bucket with water, and it would rot in the water. That's not really important to the story, but it explains what happened. 

The head had some of the neck attached and wouldn't fit in the bucket. My mom was helping me (grabbed the bucket from the garage for me) and suggested that we saw the neck off, since it was dry and couldn't be cut off easily. I said I could hack at it with a knife, but she insisted it would be easier to saw it. 

When we actually got the saw and were going to start, I noticed it looked like she was placing it a bit too far up, meaning it would cut into the skull. I said that too her, and she pointed out how the skull was ""up there"" And gestured farther up the neck area. So we started sawing. 

When we were done, I saw that about an inch of the back of the skull had been sawed off (she noticed as well) , and freaked about it. I ran to my room and stayed there for a good 20 minutes trying to compose myself. My mom was knocking on the door once in a while, telling me to come out so we could continue, ect. I asked her to stop and she did after a bit. 

When I came out I didn't really talk to her, besides answering her small talk with one or two word answers. She stopped talking to me a bit after starting because of this. I could tell it made her sad that I wasn't talking to her, but just didn't feel like talking to her, because I was still sad/mad about the skull. 

So I'm wondering, AITA for not talking to her? I feel bad about it now (a few hours after it happened), but my emotions are still kind of out of control about it, so I don't want to talk to her incase I have another little breakdown and make the situation worse."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

When we were younger we were much closer but as we got older he seemed to change, there were multiple occasions where he would alpha me and talk down to me or throw me on the ground as I was a small dude until i was like 20 and started getting into bodybuilding. 

It's been a pretty common thing on my part to agree to hangout then get second thoughts and ghost him without responding to his texts. The most recent time I didn't ghost him I went to his house which was in shambles, you couldn't see the floor it was so dirty. He had no windows and i was very uncomfortable being in a dirty place like that, but that wasn't the worst part, he pulled 4 kittens out of the closet and started beating them with magazines to ""Train"" them. This made me very uncomfortable so i faked a phone call and said i had to leave.

Most recently he asked to hang out and i just didn't respond so he flipped his lid and said ""You know what, we aren't friends anymore. You always do this, you're a huge dick, Fuck you etc.""

c1uw80	2019-06-17 23:37:29	ComfyMatress	AITA for being angry at my sister for using our slow internet to stream videos knowing very well everyone else suffers because of it?	"Okay to set the scene I (19m) have a brother and sister(14f). All 3 of us have a console that we individually use to play games. Our internet can handle this. We hover around high 80 ping when we are all connected and playing. HOWEVER our internet can’t for the love of god handle anything to a simple tab on google. If someone is playing and you do a google search BAM your ping shoots up to 500 then drops back. If someone plays Spotify on their phone then expect a constant 120. Now, if you stream a video like on YouTube or Netflix then don’t expect anything less than 900.


You might be thinking then how does anyone in the house ever watch or listen to things? Well my family has this phone plan where we have unlimited data (which gets slow after we go over a certain limit and doesn’t charge extra for it). The entire family shares the same data. So me, my brother, father and mother had phones with this data plan. My parents however don’t use Netflix and YouTube as often as the average human being today. Their main entertainment is tv.


So that’s the situation for the internet. Now for 3 years my sister has had this iPad to watch YouTube and play games on. This iPad has to really on a WiFi network to access the internet. You might see where this is going. So her main connection was our home WiFi which is fine when no one is playing. But the moment anyone gets on that person can’t play AT ALL. The workaround for this was connecting her iPad to a phone Hotspot(reminder the data on the phone is unlimited). Simple right? 


But for years she continually “forgets” to use it. And when I tell her to connect to the hotspot she gets mad. It’s like a clockwork. 6 out 7 days of the week this happens. And it’s a hassle just to make her comply. You might be asking “what about you? Don’t you forget sometimes?” And the answer is yes I do but RARELY. If I want to work on schoolwork while she is playing SHE expects me to use the hotspot on the computer (which I do with zero to no resistance) or else she threatens me to use the WiFi when I play.


Now she just got a phone a week ago (which is included in the same data plan mentioned above) and has no excuse to accidentally use the internet. However, today she started to watch Netflix on her smart Tv making me lag and refused to stop. 

Now I know I don’t pay for the internet so I can’t completely make her not use it. But the fact that both me and my brother use phone data to not make her lag while she does whatever she wants is driving me insane. 3 years of dealing with this and I’m just done. 


Today I yelled at her for her ignorance and unwillingness to watch her show on her phone or iPad while both me and my brother were playing. She doesn’t comply and my parents ground her but she reverts to the same habits in no time.

She constantly yells at me that i have no common sense and that I am stupid and all sorts of other insults, but when I talk about my self esteem problems she goes on a rant about how it is and American thing and I need to get over it. One time she even told me she wasn't going to come to my pity party.

c1uva7	2019-06-17 23:34:58	Atheist-ExChristian	AITA for refusing to let my parents track my phone?	"I’m an 18 year old who’s about to go off to college. My parents still pay my phone bill and have been pestering me to turn on the Find My Friends app for years. I really don’t feel comfortable having my location tracked. I refuse to give my location to any app that isn’t maps. They know how uncomfortable I feel but refuse to listen to me.

For context, I’ve had Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) my entire life and am a computer geek. I had a similar experience to this one when I was in middle school and parents having access to their kids’ grades 24/7 became the norm. My parents would watch my grades so closely that I would have panic attacks when one of my grades dropped below an A. When I was 14 I started receiving treatment for my anxiety and my therapist told my parents to stop. My mental health immediately improved. The point is, because of my experience in school I feel incredibly uncomfortable having anything tracked and having my privacy compromised.

Going back to being a computer geek, I’m also worried about a potential data breach. I know all too well how easily this could happen. After the Equifax breach, I can’t trust any company to keep my data safe. My parents don’t seem too concerned about it.

I’ve tried to talk it out with my parents but they refuse to listen. They know how anxiety-inducing this is for me but they still insist on it. I understand that they want to keep their baby girl safe, but at what cost? I feel that having my location tracked violates my privacy and compromises my location to potential hackers, but they don’t listen. Sometimes it feels like they never listen to me until it’s too late. I’m trying my best not to come across as a bratty kid to them. I appreciate all they do for me and I know that their hearts are in the right place, but I don’t think tracking my phone is best way to keep me safe.


Edit: [to all the people saying I should just get a job](https://imgur.com/a/pB6QtZm) to pay for my own phone plan, I’ve been trying. I have a disability that makes it difficult to hold down certain jobs. I’ve been looking into getting a low level IT, programming, web development, or graphic design job, but it’s hard to find one because of my lack of degree and work experience and because I’m moving away to go to college in a couple months.

"A local sporting goods store hosts an annual clearance event just before Thanksgiving. They sell unused items as well as their rentals (bikes, snowboards, etc.) at a massive discount (>50%). I needed a mountain bike so I checked the day before to see what was available. There were only two of what I needed, and the policy is whoever gets to it first gets it.

I showed up about 45 minutes before the official start in order to have a decent chance. They had separated of a section of parking about 40' x 150' and left an area about the same size open for people and cars. There was a small group of fewer than ten people standing by a table set off to the side, and the parking lot was divided using some orange traffic cones. I stood along the cone line instead of with the group. Over the next fifteen minutes, it gradually became apparent that that a line was going to form.

By this time there were about thirty people, so I definitely wasn't going to get in line, because like I said - I needed the bike. I stood at the front, in two car lengths of open space, and not a single person left the line to join me. When it was clearly at least 150 people, I got nervous and asked an employee if I had to be in line. She said no, so I didn't move. The line grew to well over 200 before the event started. They rang the bell. I speed-walked to the far side and got the bike. It was 100% worth it and I'd do it again, but I did feel uncomfortable anyway. I felt like TA, but I don't think I was.

For what it's worth, I had a legitimately good reason for calling the bike a 'need' but didn't put it in here because some people will judge you for an act rather than your motivation, and that's what I'm hoping for. I'm counting on you."	Not enough info	0	0	2139.0	87.0	0.0	0.0

"My mom (F51) and I (M17) were at my ceremony this evening when my she made a weird comment (which was audible to the people around us) about another person. She said, and I quote, ""Wow, she looks absolutely nothing like her mother!"" in a loud voice to the point where the people around us heard it. I saw a few people staring at her. She is not native to the States and speaks broken English at times, so I decided to inform her that saying that out loud could be taken as disrespectful and/or distasteful.

I told her that what she said was a ""little bit distasteful"" after we got in the car and this led to her going ape shit on me for the next 30 minutes. She told me that ""All those other parents in there are 500 pounds, drink alcohol, do drugs..."" trying to make herself seem like the victim, and ""Nobody there treats me the way that you do"". I had no bad intentions and did not intend for my comment to be vitriolic in the slightest.

She said that ""I would turn on her the instant I got"" and that ""nothing I ever said was good about her"", which is not true. She has called me one of the best sons in the past and said many positive things about me, but here she is now calling me ""the worst"", a ""piece of shit"" and pretty much every insult that she could think up at the time.

I continued driving and she told me to pull over, so I did. Then she decided to bring up my abusive father in the past, and said ""I know one day you're going to go back to him if he does something nice for you.""

I told her that bringing up my abusive father is just as hurtful as when she brings up my stepdad's ex-wife when they have their arguments. She frequently does this when they have arguments.

She refused to acknowledge that saying these things are hurtful to me and started trying to play the victim. She blew her top after I brought up her husband's ex and threw food all over my car and punched the window (while I was driving mind you). She told me all of the things that both her husband's ex and my abusive father did to her in the past and tried to make me feel guilty for making the comparison. I told her that I didn't want to hear about any of it but she did not listen.

I told her for 5 minutes straight that I did not intend to ""throw her under the bus"" (her words) by telling her that what she said could have been distasteful, but she continued to yell ""SHUT THE FUCK UP"" every time I tried to reconcile with her. She told me ""I'm not your mother anymore"" and ""Go back to your father, he'll do everything for you.""

We got home and she drove off while my stepdad was sitting on the porch. I have no idea where she is now. My stepdad asked me where she was going and I simply told him ""She has to go do something"" so to not start aggravate anyone else.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years, so I guess you could say things are serious. We’re definitely ready to take this step.

The last guy who rented this place destroyed it, the landlord redid a lot of stuff after that guy moved out and before my boyfriend moved in, but not everything got redone the first time around, some things need redone because they’re gotten bad over time, and my boyfriend hasn’t always been on top of general upkeep of his house. There’s a lot of stuff that needs fixed if I were to consider this “home”, I’ve suggested to the landlord that I could help out with getting things fixed up (I’m pretty handy) if he could provide some money or help if i needed to hire someone to do something. But the landlord has always been kinda wishy washy, not just about this but a lot of other things. Also because landlord and boyfriend are step brothers, they don’t have a formal lease, and this probably wouldn’t change if I moved in, which I’m uncomfortable with and have expressed as another concern to my boyfriend.

Recently my family has been going through the phase of worrying about money so we're being extra careful: I haven't had anything fun day outs for around 4-5 months now.

I was fine with this but recently my mum has been going to the theatre every other week with either the rest of my family or her friends. This sucks because I haven't gone to any but maybe she wants time alone? Not sure. 

Anyway, so her and my brother have been doing so many things just in the past 2 months, to list a few:
Went to 3 musicals
Take that! Band tour
Hugh Jackman tour
Graham Norton
List goes on and on.

It really sucks being left out but like I said, I've sort of just accepted it.

Now, I just keep asking my mum to do something with me because I'm jealous of how much fun she is having when we're suppose to be saving money.

Some of the things I've asked to do:
Go to cinema and see movie
Go to a restaurant
Go to a theatre performance I've wanted for ages.
Day out at the beach

Every single one has led to my mum getting really stressed and tell me about how we have no money and we cannot do anything which makes me feel really bad and think I'm an asshole, but at the same time she'll do this then 2 days later go see another musical.

It makes me feel really guilty, then I get mad when I see her at a musical.

As I'm writing this, they are driving back from Graham Norton and I'm just feeling left out like normal

"Awhile back, a friend \[22F\] of mine \[21F\] named Chelsea cheated on her long-distance girlfriend, Vivian \[24F\], of two years. When Vivian found out, they broke up. Chelsea moved in with the guy she had cheated with (Tyler \[21M\]). I was never very close friends with Vivian, but she was taking the breakup pretty hard (I knew because she was posting about it on facebook) and so I checked in with her to make sure she was okay—I messaged her on discord where she ranted at me for awhile about Chelsea. We talked for awhile until the emotions stopped running high, and kind of bonded over some shitty stuff Chelsea had done to us in the past. For the next few months, we would talk very occasionally just to say hi and chat about school and work and stuff.

Meanwhile, Chelsea and I had stopped talking. The falling out had been a long time coming, but the final nail in the coffin was the fact that it had been I who accidentally told Vivian about the affair\*, and Chelsea stopped talking to me after that.

A month or so later, I started hanging out with a group of friends from school. Tyler was one of the people I'd see on a regular basis in that friend group. We never saw each other outside of the group, but we were friendly and TBH he's a cool guy. One day, Vivian asked me about my friend group at school, wondering if she might know any of them. I admitted Tyler was one of them, and she blocked me on all social media immediately after telling me that she was uncomfortable being friends with someone who condones adultery.

I guess I'm wondering if I should have cut ties with Tyler and refused to talk to him just because of my connection to Vivian. Am I the asshole here?

\* What happened was that I told Vivian that about how Chelsea had been spending a lot of time out with Tyler, and from that, Vivian suspected Chelsea was cheating. When she confronted her, Chelsea confirmed that she had been, and that led to their split."	No A-holes here	0	0	2.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

1. The biggest thing that irritates me is that he always touches himself. Like everytime that we sit somewhere, his hand is on his dick. Sometimes it's just on his dick, but some goddamn times he starts playing with it in front of both me and my sister. And I don't know if this is what you just do when you get older, but it has irritated me for quite some time, sometimes I would just leave just so I don't have to watch him do it. And recently he started doing it in front of other people, whether it's in our home or when we go to someones house.

2. He picks his nose all the damn time. He says there's nothing in there and that he's doing it because it itches, but I've seen him a couple of times after pulling his fingers out of his nose, sliding his hand slowly to the side of a couch and then just shooting something from his fingers. Again I don't know if this is a habit of his or if he's faking the whole family."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1umzi	2019-06-17 23:13:41		AITA for trying to move out?	"So for story:

I'm autistic, 21, and have been trying to get my life together and out of this house where so much shit goes on. I just want to be away from my family and live on my own so I won't have to deal with anything.

I have a part time job, have been saving up money for rent near my college (unfortunately they don't dorm), and have been educating myself using Khan Academy and other online education services.

My parents and sister don't want me moving out because they think I'm immature. And I kinda am because I'm autistic and have social issues and kind of a strained relationship with my family. There's quarrels at least once a week because someone's being a little shit (usually me) and everyone else gets entangled. But I don't see why that should prevent me from moving out.

They think that the behaviours I do at home will carry on into my adult life and will cause me trouble. They don't realize that when I'm alone and undisturbed, *nothing happens. Nothing.* And that it's my job as an adult to not do that stuff.

I know not to do that stuff at school or work, but they don't trust me.

Yesterday I tried to move out but my parents caught me and my sister (27 and lives here due to her mental issues) agreed that I'm not ""stable"" or ""mature"" enough to move out and as such they took my keys and parked their car behind mine so I couldn't get out. Had to contact my landlord and explain the situation.

Now he spends a lot of money driving down to me as I can’t drive yet and he lives about 80 miles away. His birthday is coming up soon and I offered to buy him a pizza since I can’t really do any last minute shopping and I thought it would be a gift he would enjoy. I told him about it but asked anyway if he wanted a different gift. He asked for two pizzas, the thing is, I have about sixty dollars right now and not to be rude to him, but I would like to keep some to spend for things I might need in the future. I know pizzas aren’t that expensive but it’s not like I  work and get paid and sixty dollars is a lot to me as I’ve never had that amount of money at one time.

c1umjm	2019-06-17 23:12:35	thegoldenostrich	AITA for threatening to call the cops on someone whose dog was left in the car for 4+ hours?	"This happened last week, on a day that was reaching to 89 Degrees Fahrenheit with not a cloud in sight. I work at an office building that has its own private parking lot, most of the spots are under direct sun, including the car the dog was left in.  This lot has parking attendants who sometimes stroll around the lot, but they usually chill at one spot. 

&#x200B;

I was on my pre-lunch stroll and noticed a guy walking pass a car, throwing his hands up saying, passing one of the parking attendants ""my god, its like 90 degrees out, and theres a god damn dog in the car"".  I walked over, saw a black SUV, with the windows rolled more than halfway down, was a pitbull, heavily panting.  I was able to catch a parking attendant who was coming from the other side, pulled him over, and pointed at the dog and the car telling him this is not okay. I told him we need to contact the owner, move the car, or let the dog out somehow. He told me he will need to contact his manager and said the car belonged to the caterer inside who has been there since 11:30AM (this happened around 1:30PM) . The caterer also brought along his wife and kid who was chilling inside AC with him. 

&#x200B;

I went in the building with the parking attendant and notified the caterer. The caterer said its not a big deal and that he is leaving within 5 minutes. The parking attendant wanted to let it go, but I stood firm and said no, the car needs to be moved into a shaded area or taken out of the car under a tree to cool off with some water. I mentioned he is panting really hard too, caterer proceed to say hes just happy to see people passing by, and that he will be leaving in 20 minutes now. I said he needs to move it now, and he ignored me and said I don't care about it. I proceeded to say firmly that I do not mind calling the cops unless you move your car and the parking attendant started to panic a bit. The caterer said really? and I said really, and a couple of more back and forths, the caterer reluctantly told his wife to go move the car. They were not happy at all and it was an awkward situation for the parking attendants. 

&#x200B;

After all this, my coworker said I was TA because the caterer was just trying to make a few extra bucks and I probably scared him for threatening to call the cops."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	33.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

Apparently he thought I was overreacting and being shady because I didn’t clearly tell him I used that model before despite the fact he clearly saw me use him in the rp chat. I never found it to be a big deal but then he started to deflect most of his personal issues onto me. So far as to say “ I have no life and no friends” all because it seemed like I talked to him constantly. Although I have Autism Spectrum Disorder and it’s hard enough for me to be social with people even if I’m a high-functioning autistic. On top of that, he says I make everything about me when I hardly share my personal life with him but I was there for him when his mother teased him about being gay and the fact that he hated his job because he doesn’t work enough hours.

c1um5n	2019-06-17 23:11:35	Habtrashery	AITA for advising my dad to stop hosting the deprived kids of his neighbourhood?	"My father looks after his two young grandkids, my nieces, 6F and 8F. They have a lot of 'friends' in their neighbourhood which is a very poor and deprived area. No parks or good areas for the kids to play. Lots of these kids have large families who have little time for them or parents who are pretty shitty. 

My dad pretty much opens his house to these kids. They wander in whenever, they don't knock and they use the garden when he isn't home. They help themselves to the cupboards, and to my nieces toys. There are almost no boundaries. Up to a dozen 6-12 year old kids are in and out of his house all the time. I'm saying all of this upfront so you understand why this is a debate. 

I don't think he should do this and while I think he's great for trying to help these kids, the cons are too big. 

Reasons why I don't want him to keep doing this:

1. Before he had the girls there was a girl from down the road who was very similar to the friends. She'd come over whenever and there were very few boundaries. She eventually was banned from the house after it turned out she had been stealing money from my father. £10s and £20s at a time which he dismissed due to age and bad memory. 

2. A few of the 'friends' actually bully my nieces in their own home into giving them the best toys and other things. They aren't actually friends with the girls and see my fathers house as a free hangout. 

3. As I mentioned, there's a fair few of these kids and my father is elderly and ill. He can't always watch them even when he is home and they come into his property even when he isn't there. What happens if a kid gets injured on his property? Is he liable?

4. He's an older man whom some of the parents have never even met, who has kids in and out of his house with no supervision. Rumours can be nasty and the estate that they live on is rife with vicious gossip. 

So despite these kids having nowhere else to go, I still think my father should stop hosting them. He thinks I am an asshole for saying this and his sister (my aunt) takes his side. My sisters (his other daughters) take mine."	Not the A-hole	0	0	93.0	22.0	0.0	0.0
c1ulmi	2019-06-17 23:10:13	darkvulture37	AITA for walking out on my job?	"On mobile so sorry for formatting. 

For background I worked as a dishwasher at a small restaurant near where I live. We’ll call the general manager Mitch and the owner of the restaurant Jack. 

A while back, I heard from a friend in the kitchen that Mitch had referred to me as a whiny little b*tch to some others because I told him that there were certain days that I preferred not to work. 

Because I started a new and much better job soon, I went to Jack and told him I wanted to put in my 2 weeks because I was tired of coming in only to hear about how my boss talked about me behind my back. He convinced me to reconsider, and I decided that I might stay for the extra money. Fast forward a few days later. I decide that with my new hours I want to work less at my current dishwashing job. I go to Mitch and ask if I can work fewer days, and he says he’ll consider it. The next day, I come in and I’m off the schedule completely. I ask Mitch if I’m done after that day and he gets irritated like I’m wasting his time and says that “I was gonna put in my 2 weeks anyways” and “I already have the other job”. I wanted to get out eventually so I decided I would professionally handle my last day. I go and collect bus buckets from around the restaurant, and of course they’re all full because the guy before me wasn’t doing anything. I tell him that is my last day just so he knows and he says “honestly I couldn’t care less” 
At this point I’m upset that I have to deal with his crap and I know he was waiting for me to come in and do it all but it’s no big deal.  I start spraying stuff off when Mitch comes back to my station and starts yelling at me about if I’m going to stay and do my job or just be mad and keep telling people I’m leaving and leave now. Sick of him being condescending, and realizing that there’s nothing he can do about it, I decide that I’m gonna get my stuff and walk out and whatever happens is his and the other dishwasher’s problem. He told me not to use them as a reference which I definitely wasn’t planning to at that point.

c1ukjc	2019-06-17 23:07:21	evazetv	AITA for how I'm handling my girlfriend's accidental pregnancy?	"I'm 24 years old, and so is my girlfriend. We have been dating since we were 20.  We are both in different universities with about two years to go.

We have talked about marriage and kids many times, and I do want kids - just not yet. Neither does she. She wants them before she turns 30, and while I would probably prefer being around 32 years old, I'm not totally sure about any of that, as I have no idea what my life will look like in 5 years. Most importantly, I want to make enough money to buy us a bigger apartment and afford all the healthy and organic groceries, and stuff like vacations etc when the kids get older.

Additionally, I have always been scared of accidentally impregnating somebody and them keeping the baby against my will (only the women decide in Denmark), so I have vocally said, several times in the last 4 years, that if she ends up being pregnant by mistake and decides to keep it against my will, I would break up with her, and not act as a father to the child (but of course still pay child money)

Ok. So she got pregnant. I instantly assumed she didn't want the baby, and she said so, and we have been to the doctor together, and she's going to a gynocologist this Wednesday to get a medicinal abortion. Meanwhile, she has told all of her girlfriends what's going on, and they are telling her that I'm an asshole for being ready to leave her in case she decides to have a baby that I don't want.

Other than that, I feel like I'm as supportive as possible (to me, this is actually a really good thing because it means we will be able to get pregnant when the time comes). I asked her if she wants to keep the baby several times and she always says no, but I also have a feeling she sometimes contemplates if we should go for a baby right now. In my mind it's just not worth it to get a baby because we slipped up - it should be when we are ready for it...

Am I an asshole?

edit: Removed a misplaced ""no matter what"" that was bugging me when I re-read it

edit: I should maybe clarify. I haven't made the threats after she got pregnant, but I have several times before. And I know she knows and she remembers, as she has talked with her friends about it today

edit 3: I forgot to mention, one big reason we have had this chat beforehand is that her older brother accodntally got a girl pregnant as a ONS. She told him she had an abortion, but apparently she didnt have it. Now they got two (albeit very cute) twin daughters, is still with the girl even thoigh he clearly doesn't like her, and his software career is pretty much fucked because she's a stay-at-home mom that doesn't give a shit about the kids. I don't know what this has to do with anything but I guess it's backstory."	Not the A-hole	0	0	941.0	117.0	0.0	0.0

I go there to get a couple of breakfast tacos once in a while.  I used to tip but once I saw how much the starting wage was, I stopped.  I have worked in food service and I only expected tips if I was waiting on a table and making less than min wage. I have worked a job in this city that required some medical training (college classes) that paid less and we did not receive tips. My friend that was with me last time I went through the drive though thought I was an ass for not tipping.  I think they are already getting paid a decent wage to work a drive-though. To be clear I tip at least 20% at places if I am sitting down for service. This is different in my mind though because they are making a livable wage and not having to cater specifically to my table.  Am I the asshole?  What is the proper etiquette  ?

c1uifz	2019-06-17 23:02:04		AITA for not wanting my father to know my wife and I receive government assistance?	"I'll try and keep this short.  My wife and I are in a temporary financial rut.  My wife lost her job and I don't quite make enough to support us alone yet.  I am contracted to receive a promotion in 6 months and with that promotion we will be in much better shape, but in the meantime we have started receiving some government assistance to help cover groceries in the meantime.  I want to make it perfectly clear here that even before we used this program I have never been against social programs like this to help those who need it.  It is nothing to be ashamed of.

The issue is that my father is very against ""government hand outs"" as he calls them.  Every so often when we are at my parents' house he will get on political rants.  My wife and I are pretty different from in politically in almost every way so we tend to just smile and nod to avoid causing conflict as it doesn't go anywhere with him.  My mom has expressed appreciation for not arguing with him as she doesn't like to be around arguments.  

Well during one of his rants my father started groaning about ""welfare queens ruining this country"" and spewing hate towards ""parasites"" that abuse the system.  My wife became visibly upset so I ended the visit and took us home.  My wife says she wants to confront my father and tell him we are the ""parasites"" he hates so much to see what he'd have to say to that.  I told her it would be best to just avoid the subject and not to start a big fight which would inevitably break out.  

I suggested that we just reduce the amount of contact we have with my parents and that I'd work on a way to better move conversations away from politics so this stuff doesn't come up because I'd rather keep things as peaceful as possible for my mother's sake as fights and conflict stress her out horribly.

My wife says I am being a coward, but really I just don't want to fight.  Even if she does tell him and starts the fight it won't go anywhere except to upset my mother and start several shouting matches.

&#x200B;

When scheduling our wedding, my fiance and I finally landed on a solid date that everyone could attend on both sides. Put money down on non-refundable deposits for venue, food, etc., and got our invitations made. Shortly after, my grandmother and mother bring to my attention that extended family one state away (we'll call them AF) might not be able to attend, due to a surgery being a few weeks before that date.

&#x200B;

I fell on my sword. I really, *really* wanted AF to be able to attend. I adored them, and felt like we were very close despite being a state away. So, as frustrated as my fiance and her family were, we moved the wedding back 4 months. Long story short, after our invitations were sent, my cousin (not part of AF, lives in the same area as us, semi-important detail) got engaged and quickly set her date to 2 weeks before ours.

&#x200B;

AF told us they'd be there, so we set out a table for them and paid the caterers for the food, etc. They simply didn't show up. They never called, never texted, and I actually haven't had a real conversation with them since. However, they of course went to the wedding 2 weeks prior to ours.

&#x200B;

AF had a wedding (in their state, of course) not too long ago, and I did not attend. I wasn't actually even formally invited -- they just told my grandma to invite me. I legitimately felt like there's no way they *truly* wanted me there, on top of being at least a bit bitter. I must say, though, at least I had the decency of being upfront and telling them I wouldn't attend (a courtesy I did not receive). So here it is, **am I the asshole for not attending the wedding?**

&#x200B;

Mildly amusing bit of ""karma"" below for anyone interested. Not relevant to the question above.

&#x200B;

The cousin who set her date to 2 weeks before ours has a sister who just got married. About 2 months before her wedding, her future brother-in-law and his fiance set their date to a week before hers. I can understand her being a bit upset, after all, I know how that feels (and of course, *she* wasn't the cousin who scheduled right before our wedding). That side of the family were, of course, infuriated. They couldn't understand how someone could possibly be that rude. I found their reaction a bit amusing, considering the circumstances :P

&#x200B;

Edit for clarity:

I left some bits of info out to avoid posting a massive wall of text. I wasn't formally invited, however, if you ask them I was. They proxy-invited me through my grandmother. My question is the result of being hounded (by my grandmother) leading up to the wedding, and snide remarks after the wedding."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1ui68	2019-06-17 23:01:26	Simi_Grimm	"AITA for hating all these ""family gatherings""?"	"Background: So I'm the youngest of 6 kids... Just for starters... My oldest sister is pushing 60, and I'm only 30. All of my siblings have at least 3 kids, and not only do I not have any, I don't like kids. Especially kids in this day and age. But this is nothing new, I didn't like kids even when I was a kid... I'm also VERY Irish/Scottish, so I burn like a slug on the sidewalk. (it's important later)  


So about an hour ago I was reminded of something awful, I was invited to yet another family gathering this weekend. It's one of my siblings kid's 8th grade graduation party... Now call me an asshole, but I never got an 8th grade graduation party, hell I didn't even get a high school graduation party. So that right there makes me a bit salty. 

The other issue is that this is the 6th family party that I've been invited to since new years! (Not counting new years mind you) and every single time someone has a party for literally anything, they expect everyone to bring presents for all the kids. I'm sure you can do the math on how many kids that is...

So over the past year I've been busy with my own life, and I've been just avoiding these things like the damn plague, but my mom still tries to guilt trip me every time I say I can't make it to yet another party for a arbitrary event. (I'm not counting birthdays, and Christmas in that statement)

So I have missed pretty much every party since late last year. So now my mom is trying to preemptively guilt trip me by saying ""well a bunch of people said they couldn't make it last week"" Like that's some how my problem. 

Another reason I don't want to go is because it's outdoors, at a state park. So no tv that I can watch while my family blatantly ignores me (which they do every single time because we have nothing in common, and they think what I'm doing with my life is stupid), no wifi so that means I'll be burning through cell data keeping myself from dying of boredom, and even if I some how find SPF 3000 I'll still end up with a horrible sunburn, which makes me physically sick for days. Not to mention the constant negging from pretty much all my siblings, plus the constant ""well when are you going to have a kid/loose weight/get a real job/insert the other 9 million things they find to bitch about?""

So yeah... I really hate these things. It's made even worse by the fact that my husband hates these things too, so I have to go by myself every time.

&#x200B;

I also do have this very childish thought that runs through my head about ""well I didn't get a party/presents for this, why should you?!""  And I fully understand that it's not the kids fault, but I do find the whole thing extremely annoying.

It was up and down with us for those two months between fighting and tolerating each other.

&#x200B;

Today I saw her on Tinder, so I figured I would try and talk with her and let her know that I plan to go on dates and move on to be sure we're on the same page. She told he it's extremely fucked up that I'm wanting to do that while I'm still living there when I'm leaving in a very short time.

"During our hiring process, we interviewed a number of promising applicants and narrowed our selection to two candidates. This was a public relations type position, so we were looking for applicants who are social media savvy. The two final candidates were both well-qualified. 

Candidate #1 presented himself well (think your typical white male news anchor). However, his only viewable social media accounts are linked to his current job, while his personal twitter account is private. 

Candidate #2 also presented himself well. However, in addition to his work-related twitter account, he also has a personal twitter account we could see. Scrolling through his account I could see some of the LGBTQ advocacy work he has done in his personal time, some of the events he organized for previous Pride parades, cultural things he has done with the community (he's from a minority background), the athletic events he and his partner have participated in, and some of his interactions with people on his personal twitter account. Honestly, seeing this personal side of candidate #2 made us feel like we know him better and want to hire him more. 

So we sent the social media information to HR to make sure we can incorporate what we learned about candidate #2 from his personal twitter account in our hiring decision (also just to have a document trail). We didn't give candidate #1 a chance to respond to this but we basically decided on candidate #2. It does feel like we punished candidate #1 for keeping his social media private, but the fact of the matter is being able to learn more about candidate #2 tipped the scale. Are we the assholes?"

Now let’s make this quick since I only have 3000 characters to use. Let’s start here. Me and my mom are big procrastinators! For example the dishes. It had gotten so bad we ha fruit flys for MONTHS. They did go away till we moved out which hasn’t happened yet. I also barely saw my mom an hour a day. She was always out with these random friends I knew nothing about and she still refuses to tell me. Because of this and me having to go to school it makes barely any time for us to be together. It also became more about herself than me. It was her 1st friends 2nd me 3rd. Eventually she stopped working. Didn’t get fired or quit. She never tried for another job just didn’t do it. Because of that we barely made it from month to month. One day she told me we were gonna move and it got me excited. On the day before my birthday she told me she didn’t get the apartment and I was gonna live with my dad. My dad picked me up and his friend gave him money to take me out because IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY!! It had been about a month and now I go to school and live hours away from where I used to. I haven’t talked to her since. My mom and others have told me she has depressions which makes some sense.

c1uaak	2019-06-17 22:41:29	throwaway84530	AITA for telling coworker she is a controlling hypocrite?	"I have this bud at work named R. He works there, along with his fiance and his brothers fiance. Recently, probably due to the stress of an upcoming wedding, R and his fiance have been arguing at work a lot. He usually tries to stop it but she can be relentless. She routinely attempts to bring the rest of the workplace into their disputes, often by insulting us.

Now, R has been making an attempt to get to know his brothers fiance. They have some common ground, and a few weeks back he spent about 30/40 minutes in our downtime talking with her and planning a get together with his brother and their spouses. He can be really really talkative. He will totally space out on what's going on around him and just keep talking. The whole time he is in the other room talking to her, his fiance is just mocking him and talking about how hes flirting with this chick, etc. This is important, because now R is off on a business trip for a while, and she has still been bringing up this incident in his absence. 

So, we have this new hire at work who she instantly bonded with, so to speak. She has been spending a lot of time talking to the guy, going to lunch with him, going over to his house, etc. Meanwhile, she keeps bringing up the incident a few months ago with her fiance, R, and his brothers fiance. Well, yesterday I lost it, I was tired of hearing her talk shit, and she isn't my friend, so what did I care? At least that was my thought process. So I told her exactly what I thought when she again brought all this shit up in front of us (her coworkers). I told her, basically, that she was a controlling hypocrite. That her fiance R spends a little while making friends with his soon to be sister in law, and we never hear the end of it, but the moment she makes a new friend, she can do all kinds of stuff without it being labeled as flirting, or cheating, or emotional cheating (these are the things she usually says about R and his brothers fiance). Well that was it. I have definitely made an enemy, which I'm okay with. 

But I brought this up with my friends and family and they are pretty split on what I did. So I have been reflecting and now I'm debating whether or not I should apologize to her. I hope this all made sense. So everyone, let me have it. AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1u94q	2019-06-17 22:38:32	KhabaLox	AITA for taking a day off work while my wife and two son's were out of town visiting my mother?	"I recently started a new job where we have ""unlimited"" vacation.  As long as you get it approved by your manager, you can take as much time as you want.  I haven't been here long enough (<6 months) to see how much people take, but I report to the CFO with a Director title so I can probably take 3-4 weeks without too much trouble.  We are taking a 2 1/2 week vacation with my wife's extended family (~30 people total) at the end of July, which I got approved just after I started.

My wife has scheduled two other trips for the summer: one week at my mom's and one week at my dad's.  Since I just started my job (in March) and I already had 2.5 weeks scheduled off, it was agreed that she would take the kids herself.

Because I work in the finance department, my work is somewhat cyclical on a monthly basis (bulk of my job is preparing the financial reports and decks for management and owners), so while Accounting is finishing up closing the books, I'm not as busy at other times.  On the Friday before they left (on a Sunday), it was clear that the following week wasn't going to be too busy, so I asked my boss for Monday off, which was granted.  On Sunday, before they left, my wife asked me to take a package to the Post Office to buy postage and mail it.  I told her no problem, I'm taking Monday off so I can do it.  She got very upset and brought up the fact that I didn't take days off for the boy's last day of school (4th and 5th grade, so no big graduation ceremony or anything) and a few other events/days (I can't remember what specifically she called out other than last day of school).  She said I was being selfish for taking a day off when they were out of town rather than when they were in town.

To be fair, given my position and the relationships I've developed with the CEO and CFO, I could probably take almost any day off outside of the week leading up to the monthly Board/Exec Committee meeting where my deck gets presented, though I might have to work longer hours leading up to it to get whatever projects I have done.  That said, I just wanted to take a day off to enjoy some alone time playing video games in an empty house. Am I an asshole for not taking a day off here and there to spend time with the family?"

c1u5nr	2019-06-17 22:30:18		AITA for cutting a friend off after she got back with her boyfriend	"so... needless to say, my friend has had a pretty turbulent relationship with her boyfriend. they’ve been together about seven months, and have broken up twice. 

the first time they broke up, was because he called her fat and said he wasn’t physically attracted to her anymore. after that break up, i was there for her. she was understandably upset it went down. the kicker was that they got back together the next day. first of all, why would you want to be with someone you aren’t attracted to, and why would she want to get back together with someone who called her fat? 

however, despite all this, i stayed friends with her. whenever we would hang out she would complain about him for 90% of the time we were together. they broke up again for about a week because he would never make time for her. he would have plans, and then cancel them last minute to do something else. they are now back together and i’m kinda over it.

my reasons for cutting her out are:

1) i don’t always want to hear about relationship issues. i help when i can, but when it takes up 90% of our time together, every time we hang out together, it’s tiring. 

2) i blatantly told her i did not want to hang out as a group. every time i try to make plans, she tried to include him, despite me telling her i don’t wanna hang out with him. 

3) she is always having issues with him. no matter how much advice i give, it gets ignored.

I’m now in a relationship with my current girlfriend and it has been almost perfect so far. She’s kind, free-spirited and loving. She also gets along with my kids which is most important for me. 

Anyway my girlfriend’s birthday is coming up. I asked her what she wanted and at first she said she didn’t really want anything, but I pushed. 

Lo and behold she really wants to go skydiving. I decided to bite the bullet and take her. I wasn’t planning to share any of this with my ex wife out of sensitivity. But stupidly I didn’t tell my girlfriend to be discreet (she and my ex never talk so I didn’t think it would be an issue). However, my girlfriend told my youngest daughter about what we were doing and my daughter (who can’t keep anything in longer than five minutes) told my ex wife.

Family wedding, we all went out to a sports bar during the empty time between ceremony and reception.  I’m 21, my older sister is 24, and my oldest sister is 27.  When I walked in my oldest sister told me she didn’t like her drink and asked if I wanted it.  I said yes and took it and sat down and started drinking, and my other sister tried it as well.  After about 10 minutes the bartender came over and asked for my ID, but he seemed sort of upset and snappy  at me already.  I thought he assumed I was underage and he was pissed off and preparing to throw me out.  He scrutinized my ID as if he didn’t believe me and then scoffed and handed it back.  I felt like this was rude but I thought it was over so whatever.  

He then asked for my sister’s ID, and she said she didn’t have it on her.  I didn’t know this, and I know she’s of age, so I didn’t see any problem with letting her have some of my drink.  The dude got very upset at us and snatched the drink from me and threw it out.  I was surprised and felt like he was sort of overreacting since I knew this as a misunderstanding.  I was mad at him for the way he was acting so I got mad and angrily told him that that was MY drink.  He was angry right back and said “Yeah I’m not getting my bar shut down. You can buy another one if you’d like.” I said absolutely not and moved away.  

It bothered me all day and I can’t let it go.  I know he was in the right to take it because of my sister but I felt like he was way too angry over the misunderstanding and seemed to assume I was trying to be sneaky.  I know that to me, we were doing nothing wrong so this guy’s anger and snappy-ness was out of nowhere and made me angry.  I also know that to him, he was doing his job and was pissed off at the people who jeopardized his job.

c1u0zx	2019-06-17 22:19:37	pinto999	AITA for moving my roommates wet clothes out of the washer and into her hamper where they got ruined from flooding?	"Details:

Like every weekend, one (or two) of my roommates throws his/her clothes into the washer/dryer then yeets out of town for the weekend. So when I wake up early saturday morning to do my own laundry, I find that both the washer and dryer are both already full and no one is home. I text Jane a friendly ""hey are you doing laundry?"", obviously inferring to come get your shit out of the washer. Jane says ""oh sorry i'm gone for the weekend you can just move it"", so I move her dampish clothes out of the washer and into her hamper on the floor, then load mine in.

I'm a dude so I'm skeptical about putting women's delicate clothing in the dryer because my sister used to always yell at me for doing that and ruining clothes that weren't meant for the dryer. Either way she said to just move them, so whatever.

So I do all my laundry and the next day she comes home, then the following day she sends me this exact text, word for word:

""Sorry I should have clarified to not put my wet laundry on the ground...? Usually putting it in the dryer is standard practice. At the very least you could have told me you left my clothes on the ground (that got soaked/dirty when it flooded in the basement).""

So we got some rain and apparently her clothes got all soaked from the water pooling in the basement and she blames it on me for not putting her clothes in the dryer. I responded saying basically ""hey maybe don't throw all your shit in the laundry then bounce for the weekend, obviously I was not expecting the basement to flood and yes if you would've just asked me to put your clothes in the dryer I would've done it, but you didn't."" (I didn't sound that nasty when I said it).

I also said I'm kinda sick of frustrated with finishing three other people's laundry anytime I need to do my own, since this is a common occurrence and I NEVER leave clothes in the washer/dryer for more than an hour after they're done.

I'm genuinely curious if IATA in this situation, she works in corporate and apparently these were a bunch of really expensive clothes that got ruined. Obviously you're only hearing my side of the story so take it as you may."	Not the A-hole	0	0	55.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

Our first year, Grace unfortunately ended up doing pretty poorly in her premed classes. Still determined to be a doctor, she started putting in more time and effort into her studies. I on the other hand, excelled in my premed classes. I offered to help her,and we often studied together, but she really struggled to understand the material. She hired private tutors, studied day and night, but nothing seemed to help. Even though her grades did improve from freshman year, they still weren’t high enough to be competitive for medical school. During our sophomore year, she decided to switch to nursing. She was eventually accepted into our schools nursing program and has been doing great in the program. I’m really happy for her, and am glad she’s found the right profession for her. 

Recently, I was accepted into medical school. To say it was the best day of my life doesn’t even come close to expressing how happy I was. This has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. Naturally, she was one of the first people I called when I found out, but her reaction really surprised me. She told me that going to medical school is a huge waste of time, and that the future of medicine is nursing. That nurses are the real heroes of medicine and that doctors don’t really care about patients and only the money. These comments really made me upset, and I just asked her why she couldn’t be happy for me when she knows this is what I’ve wanted for a long time. She said she was just being honest. I left it at that and said I had to go.

The next day she called me again and said that she was sorry for hurting my feelings, but she wanted me to know the truth, which was that I would be better off going to nursing school. She said nurse practitioners learn everything a doctor does in 2 years, and that medical school is a huge waste of time and money. I got really upset and told her that I don’t appreciate her comments, and that she doesn’t know what she’s talking about. That nurse practitioners do not learn everything that a doctor does in 2 years, and to say that is an insult to doctors. I also told her that her earlier comments about doctors being in it for the money  were extremely disrespectful considering most doctors go in to enormous debt, give up 11-15 years of their life to train, and undergo massive amounts of stress all to help people. She called me a pretentious asshole and hung up.

c1u0e1	2019-06-17 22:18:12		WIBTA for ruining my friend's relationship by telling her BF the truth?	"We had a houseparty, Sarah was there. The night progressed, after consuming a lot of weed and alcohol, I woke up in the morning with a broken toe, remembering very little. 


The next night we were going to meet up with Sarah, her BF and a couple of other people. She then texted me if I remember what happened and I didn't know where she was getting. I thought I said something rude to her, and I knew she got mad at me for stuff like that, so I just thought we will meet up in a couple of hours anyway and talk. 

So we meet up in the evening, I ask her what's wrong. She said it's nothing, they just had an argument with bf. We sit down and 30 minutes later, Sarah goes away with her BF and they talk in another room. 

Then she comes back, comes up to me and says that we have to leave. I didn't know where she was getting at and I asked her why. 

She claimed that the previous night we ALMOST had sex and that I was the one who was pushing her into it. She said it as if I forced her into it and she couldn't do anything about it because she was so wasted. She said we didn't go as far as actually having sex, but there was kissing and touching in intimate places involved. 

She told this to her boyfriend, and he said that I need to leave or there will be a fight. So I left, puzzled, I didn't know what to say, I didn't remember doing anything like that, and my friend who was there the previous night said that we had the opportunity, but Sarah certainly wasn't in a state where she couldn't have said no, in fact, I was with Sarah for mere 30 minutes one time during the evening, alone. 

Disclaimer: we are all underage for both alcohol and weed. 

Now Sarah's BF hates me, obviously. He is very against binge drinking and weed, and would probably break up with Sarah for just smoking. 

I have to clear this up, so my plan is to tell him, that we did smoke weed (Sarah didn't mention that part to him), and that he can ask everyone at the party and they will tell him that she wasn't in a state where she couldn't have said no. After we spent those 30 minutes, just the two of us, apparently - we went back to the others and the people at the party claim that she was as cheerful as ever, she didn't look like someone who got abused. God that sounds horrible to say. 

Also, Sarah has a past of hooking up with guys on parties, I have seen her do that many times, and she also tried doing it to me a couple of months ago, and I managed to tell her that I wasn't interested. Her boyfriend knows none of these. 

I believe Sarah wanted to cover up whatever happened between us that night by saying I forced her into it. It would be a nasty thing to do. That is only my opinion tho, it sucks that I don't remember. 

So, WIBTA if I told her BF everything, the complete truth? (this would probably make them break up). Even if he still hated me I want to get the truth out there because these lies all just cause a mess."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1txc7	2019-06-17 22:11:41	not_cinderella	AITA for not wanting my brother to come on vacation?	"I'll be graduating university next year, and have been saving up money since my last year of high school to go on a post-grad trip somewhere I've never been before.

&#x200B;

I really want to go on a cruise, like in the Mediterranean but unfortunately the laws are if you're under the age of 25, you can't book a cabin on a cruise line (pretty sure it's to discourage drunken college kids and their friends from booking cruises) so sadly I had to forego that idea and think of something else. I was planning to go alone because most of my friends are older than me by a year and already working so they can't get time off.

&#x200B;

Yesterday my mom came to me with a suggestion: she and my dad book the cruise cabin for me and I pay them back, and then she and my dad go on the cruise with me. I'm super close with my parents and honestly don't mind this idea at all. I'd probably feel more comfortable with them there anyways so I said yes I would up for that.

&#x200B;

The problem: my mom thinks we should invite my 31 year old brother (who lives at home as well) to come too. I paused when she said that and immediately began rethinking the whole thing. My brother and I don't really get along for a lot of reasons, and for reasons I won't go into detail here, having him tag along would honestly ruin the trip for me. He's not disabled or anything like that, he's just... a hard person to get along with.

&#x200B;

I told my mom how I felt and explained why, and while she understood and agreed we would probably be less stressed out on the trip if he didn't come with us, she said it wasn't fair for us not to invite him. I told her I understood but in that case, I wasn't going on a cruise at all then. I feel like this is MY post-grad trip that I will be paying for and I'm okay with my parents there but not my brother. I wasn't even going to invite my (34 year old) sister (who doesn't live with us) who I actually do get along with. I told my parents thanks for the offer of the cruise, but I was going to be planning a different vacation then.

&#x200B;

They were pretty disappointed, so I feel like the asshole but at the same time, I just don't think I could handle going on vacation with my brother, especially on a cruise when we're basically stuck on the ship most of the time except when it's in port. I couldn't easily avoid him. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	373.0	334.0	0.0	0.0
c1txb7	2019-06-17 22:11:37	ylisilanna	AITA in these mother daughter quarrels??	"I am not coming here for approval, If I'm really the crazy one being the asshole I want honesty so that I can change my behavior, but I think living with my mom for so long has just driven me so crazy that I don't really know what's out of pocket and what's not- I need an outside perspective so bad. I was always a bit of a messy kid, could never keep the room totally neat but I did try and that is always the causation for our problems.

My mom would pick fights with me starting when I was about 10ish, this included definite emotional/physical abuse because she was screaming words at me that no 10 year old should ever hear, for situations such as the following specific examples:

\-Some papers being out of a folder in my backpack (threw the contents of the bag and the bag at me and then started hitting me

\-I had fell and on my way down scraped the side of my leg and was bleeding, she was mad that I was jumping off a desk with a sharp edge- understandable, but if I'm already bleeding does that constitute smacking me in the face at that very moment?

I have other examples but the most important thing to remember with those is that both were from when I was 10 years old. It has only gotten worse. I am 19 now which is why I believe she stopped hitting me because she knows id call the cops, but the emotional abuse continues. She does it when my dad isn't home so he barley ever believes me. Shell tell me things like Im worthless or that I'm a pig because my room is never perfectly neat or that I should just leave already because no one wants me at home anymore. She uses curses in between those sentences but I won't include those. I used to fight back which Ive realized is not the answer because it just gives her more reason to come at me so I stopped a while ago. It continues, The worst part is that afterwords two things may happen. I will get blamed for an argument she started and she will start crying to my dad, or she acts like nothing just happened and she didn't just go batshit crazy on me- I can hear her laughing while I'm crying in my room from the hurtful words.

So today I realised that I felt like I couldn’t take these games at my own pace, specifically wanting to explore and whatnot while he wants to focus on objectives and missions which is taking the fun out of it for me just a bit, he’s not adamant about me not wasting time in the slightest, but I feel like I’m postponing the parts *he* enjoys while I do this so I end up rushing regardless.

No arguments arouse out of me expressing this since we both know it’s just a game and we want to both enjoy it, so I asked to play most of this content by myself for the first time.

He was a bit bummed out since we’ve played through quite a bit together already but saw no problem with it, but now I feel pretty guilty since we rarely find games to play together that I also like.

I met this girl around 4 years ago when she moved to new Zealand from America, while in new Zealand she met an amazing guy who had also moved from America. they got together and have found out they are having a baby. 

it's a boy and they have been discussing baby names, they settled on a very samoan name, nobody in there family is samoan and they have no ancestral ties to samoa. it's also very commonly used for samoan boys so I could easily see people assuming he is samoan just by his name. I also think it's not ok but that's my opinion. 

she posted on Facebook asking people what we thought of her baby name and I told her that I found it dumb that she is not samoan but picked a samoan name. I also told her that I find it incredibly unfair to force your kid to have a samoan name when he is not samoan. some people agreed with me. I then get an angry message from her telling me how rude i was and that it's her baby name and how much she loves it.

My boyfriends mothers best friends daughter is getting married in September.

They have known each other forever, and, are off course good friends with the family.

I have met the mother and daughter a few times and like them both well enough. I was not surprised when me and boyfriend got an invite to the wedding (I was named, not just a +1) but I was a but surprised to get one for the bridal shower, sense we have only met a handful of times. 

But I think cool, I like this girl, and even if she only invited me because of obligation i don't mind going.

So today me and my boyfriends mom were talking about the wedding shower (Which is in three weeks) and gifts, and she asked me if I wanted to go in with her. I said yes I would be happy to.

The bride to be wanted a 150+ flatware set. So it came to about 40 dollars each. (Me, Boyfriends mom, Boyfriends two sisters)

I thought all was good until i got a group text. One of the sisters thinks it is ""cheesy"" for us all to go in on one gift, and that we should all get her something else as well. But i looked at her registry, to do that would be another 40+ bucks. (She does have cheaper stuff, but they are all like sets of 4 or something, and I don't want to just get her two out of set)

So now she wants this to end up being a 80+ dollar venture (Probably 100+ after shipping) and this is just the shower. I still have to get her a wedding gift (not to mention a dress and everything else but I understand that is on me).

So reddit, what do you think, WIBTA if I did not get a second gift and just went in on the family gift?

(Also as a side note, the daughter in question still lives at home, she pays her own bills, but she is certainly not dealing with other responsibilities. Also she is a cop so she makes a pretty decent salary.)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	646.0	130.0	0.0	0.0

" A year ago my best friend was engaged and asked me to be his best man to which I happily obliged. This guy and I have grown up together and lived together over the years. He found his girlfriend who ended up being amazing for him and I was so happy he found someone to love and start his family with. 

As the plans got going and all the groomsmen had been picked.(there were 7 of us) the groom to be (Doug) asked about his bachelor party. We live 3 hours apart and had to plan over the phone when we could. We also worked opposite shifts. The other groomsmen were also busy with life and work. Most of us groomsmen work blue collar jobs and had trouble getting time off for the wedding let alone a bachelor party.

The real problems ensued when Doug only wanted to go to Indianapolis. There we bars and things he wanted to do which wasn't a problem until I was tasked with planning the while adventure. After about 2 weeks of the runaround on the phone from the groom and the groomsmen I sort of gave up. I had no direction to which go and also had no idea how to plan for 7 people to make this happen. When I told Doug how it was going he blew it off and said it was ok we would do something after the wedding for his bachelor party.

After the wedding we barely stayed in touch to where we only talked at holidays. He recently came back to our hometown and we had a really nice lunch and got caught up. He asked what I was doing this coming September on the weekend of my birthday. I told him I might be planning on going to a baseball game out of town and to get away because me and my significant other have not been on any sort of vacation since she had heart surgery last October. He told me I needed to cancel that and take him to Indy for the bachelor he never got.

My wife and I have been together for 15 years, married ten.  Before my wife and I met, I fathered a child (my wife and I met a month before the child was born) with a woman I met in rehab.  The woman had multiple partners and I had doubts the child was mine.  Nevertheless, wifey and I started our lives together and were happy.  Fast forward 5 years and the baby mamma relapses and goes to jail at which point I was contacted by the state and asked to take a paternity test.  

&#x200B;

The child is mine.   

I never told my wife that there was a possibility that I had a child I'd never seen.  

I was mandated to pay child support.  

I sued for custody of the child and lost even though the mom is still on drugs, homeless and a 4 time felon.  

The wife and I went through two marriage counselors and a trial separation due to the drama.  

&#x200B;

During the time my wife and I have been together, her career took off and mine peaked and then crashed about 4 years ago.  We had been neck and neck as far as salaries go until then.  My company reorganized and my position was eliminated.  I was forced take a job at a non-profit with low pay.  Currently, she makes $160k per year and I make $40K per year BEFORE $800 per month child support.  

Here's the asshole part...

I deposit $700 of my $900 bi-weekly paycheck (net)  into our joint account for my share of our expenses while she deposits less than a third of her pay into the account.  The joint account leaves no room for extras as the expenses are counted to the last penny.  We have no joint savings account or any other kind of marital finances (not even life insurance).  I feel as though she's holding a grudge against me because of my past mistakes.  Our marriage has healed in every other area but finance is still a sore spot.  She thinks the state will garnish her paycheck or freeze our bank account even though my attorney told her that none of that was possible.  I don't know what she does with any of the money she earns.  She criticizes me every time I buy a pair of socks.  If I need new underwear, it takes an act of congress to get $15 from her just so I can cover my bare ass.  

I think that it is unfair that I deposit 80% of my pay yet she deposits only 25% percent of hers.  As a result, I'm driving part-time for a ride share service so I can have a little pocket change.

We arrived too early. At around 8 AM when my test was at 11:40 AM. My mother was nauseous on the way and vomited once. But she was fine. We found the IELTS testing center and we were able to use the restrooms.

Of course. The employees there identified us.

But since I had 4 hours or so left until I can do my test. We started walking around. But since it was still relatively early in the morning there were barely any shops or stores open... Well... Except one gaming internet cafe.

I go in. My mother agrees that I just sit there for a while. At least an hour or two. So I start looking around and to my shock the place is actually pretty nice. I sat there and started playing CS GO.

Now something you should know about CS GO: It's highly competetive and if you disconnect your accounts gets a cooldown and loses some (Trust) factor. This trust factor plays into putting you with more respectable teammates with a similar rank.

I really care about that.

I have been playing for around 40 minutes now when my mother comes into the internet cafe. Which was weird for me because she was supposed to walk around or go to a cafeteria. Our meeting place would've been the IELTS testing center.

She tells me I need to go out. But the match was 10-9 to our team (16 rounds won and you win the match)

It would've taken me 10 minutes to finish the match... But my mom stuck around. Telling me I need to go to the IELTS building with her.

I ask her why. As there was no real reason for me to go and risk a cooldown. When I can just play 10 minutes and get up normally.

She said she needed to use the bathroom. I told her to go to the IELTS center and use the restrooms there. It's literally down the street. She said she couldn't because she wasn't the one taking the exam. But the staff already knew her. No one would stop her from using the bathrooms.

I told her to leave her things with me but she wouldn't. She just sat next to me waiting for me. I just told her to go. She's been here before.

The good Samaritan working the cafe decided to turn my computer off after seeing the sad humanitarian scene of this kid ignoring his mother telling him to do his IELTS test.

Decided to be a good man and help this poor mother.

It was 13-12 when he turned off my PC. 

We went to the IELTS test center. And I waited 3 fucking hours I could do my test. All because my perfectly-abled mom wanted to use the bathroom. And mistakenly thought that she wouldn't be allowed.

McDs does not appear busy.  But to be on the safe side, I ordered a normal menu item - a quarter pounder meal.

I've had a lot of orders screwed up, had to wait quite often, but that's when I order something like a grilled chicken sandwich, or a lot of food to take back home. I'd like to think those were random weirdness, but now it's become a pattern, and I was really aggravated by this. ) 

She got snippy with me, said they can only cook so many at a time, take slot #3 and wait.

I almost asked for my money back, but decided by the time they got a manager around, got my money, it would take 5-10 minutes.

My food was out before I could get parked. I feel like they gave me someone else's order that was the same, just because I griped, so that made me feel kinda bad.

Was I an asshole for finally getting enough and saying something to them though?  Yeah, I know - you knew the possibility of a fubar or a long wait, but you went there anyway... but it really was the nearest option that I thought could keep me on schedule and ahead of the inbound storm."

We were on vacation and came across this person who did free cartoon portraits of individual people. Based on the ones she had as examples, she drew really exaggerated pictures: some had ones with really large noses and eyes, others with small faces and big bodies (not saying those are bad qualities, just trying to give a visual).

My mom insisted all of my family get one done. I polietly refused and explained that I just didn't want one because of the fear that my self image could become worse than it already was.

My mom got really upset and didn't let either of my sisters get one done despite them being all for it. I told her that they could get one done but I just didn't want one. She made all of us leave the area empty-handed.

I think it was really unnecessary to not let my sisters get a portrait done, and I also think her response to my request to not get this portrait done was also unnecessary. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	7.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c1ts16	2019-06-17 22:00:13	hayb8lle	AITA for my work check bouncing/all the confusion afterwards?!	So here’s the deal. I started a new job end of April. On May 31st, payday, I told my boss I had lost my paycheck from the previous pay period. He says he will handle it on Monday with the bank and get me a new copy but 30$ would be deducted from the original check. I take my first check, the second check (the reprint) and my check from May 31st to the bank. I deposit all. Today I go to deposit my check from this last Friday and ask for my balance and it’s 257$ in the negative. WHAT!? Turns out my check has bounced. I call my work and let them know the check they’ve given me has bounced. My boss let’s me know this is a large accusation. And that he can’t possibly believe it’s true. He calls me back and says that the reprint has cleared and that the check that bounced was the original check I told him I had lost. He immediately starts giving me a lecture about how poorly this reflects on me. Asking if I knew I had requested a new check when I really hadn’t lost my check at all. And letting me know how other people such as the payroll lady feel about this accusation and “what I’ve done.” I immediately apologize because I’m so stunned and begin to start wondering if this is what happened? He says we will just talk about it next time I come in and angrily hangs up. I’m like in tears at this point & I feel like a fool. So I start going through my paystubs, I’m suppose to have four by now. I realize I’m missing one check stub from the end of April/beginning of May. As I look at the reprint second check and the third check I realize they have the same check number and wouldn’t ya know it are 30$ apart. At this point I’m like that Charlie day meme staring at all the crazy photos on the wall.. and realizing that instead of printing my lost check they’ve printed my most recent check and I not realizing they were the same because of the 30$ in price deposited them together with my first check. I’m still missing the lost check. I take all this information and go into my work to talk to my boss. I explain to him that on May 31st I asked him for a reprint of the previous pay periods check. He says “Yeah I gave you that” I try to explain that if I asked him for a reprint of the check from the previous pay period why would he give me a reprint of the check I was receiving that day and clearly had in my possession?! He makes like a huge sigh and explains to me how mad the payroll lady is and that this is clearly my mistake. I apologize for not being more specific and volunteer to apologize to the payroll lady, again, but still explain that I’ll need my check reprinted. He explains that it’ll cost me another 30$ to reprint. Mind you I’ve been incurring overdraft charges to my account from the check that bounced. I leave the office feeling like am I the fucking asshole or is this guy ignorant?! Ive been made to feel like I’ve caused some huge shitstorm now.	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

I went to a barber.. parked my bike outside and a man was standing smoking. I went inside and later he came in and sat. When a chair was free, he got up and got his haircut first. I told the barber that i came in first cause to my understanding its always who get in the store first. Same with ques, like if the person leaves the que then they lose the spot. But the dude started raging and wanted to fight and started cursing at me saying ""he arrived first but he wanted to smoke"". ofcourse i threatened to call the police if he makes his moves. The barber then calmed him down and asked me not to call the police to avoid shit. I kinda felt bad about acting up over such a petty situation so i tipped the barber. So Guys.. in such situation am i the asshole?. Really im open to anyones opinion to avoid petty situations like that in the future/or to stand my ground if im right.

Much thanks!

Edit: I was not pissed until he cursed at me. I then said I'd call the police. Yes he's bigger and could've knocked me out with one blow so i couldn't think of anything else but telling I'd call the police.

c1tq7u	2019-06-17 21:56:04	mobe2019	WIBTA if I take my new kitten back to the shelter?	"I adopted a two and a half month old kitten three days ago and I’m already regretting it immensely. It wasn’t really a reckless decision, I’ve been moved out of my parents place for four years and it’s always something I’ve thought about. I love animals and adore my parents’ dogs. But I’ve never had a cat or lived with one, and I’ve never really been around kittens. But I’m an animal lover so I thought it would be fine, and I could be a better owner than to a dog because of my work and college schedule. 

Last Monday I moved into my own apartment (no roommates or their dogs) and on Friday I said “fuck it I’m getting a cat.” My kitten is very cute and sweet but I was not prepared for how needy he’d be. He insists on sitting on my face and purring 24/7 and following me from room to room. Also he’ll only use his litter box if I’m in the same room as it because he CANNOT be away from me for a second or he’ll start meowing his head off, otherwise he just pees right next to me. I’ve been cleaning the litter box 3-4 times a day and my apartment still smells like cat. I always thought that cat houses had that smell because the owners weren’t diligent enough, but nope, they all smell like that. I’m quickly coming to the conclusion I’m just not a cat person. 

I always swore I would never be the type of early 20s fucker that recklessly got animals and disposed of them and I feel like that’s what I am. This cat deserves better and idk what to do. He’s so sweet and I wish someone I knew wanted him, but they don’t. 

AMITA if I take this cat back to the shelter?

Edit: I’m glad so many of you called me out, I needed it. I was having post adoption anxiety and truly didn’t understand how needy kittens are, but we’ll make it work. Him and I are going to have to figure it out, but I don’t see me getting rid of him in the foreseeable future. Thank you from Chicken (chicken the kitten) and I."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I’m 19, in the first summer after college. I’m desperate to avoid student loans so I’m working 60ish hours a week this summer so I don’t have a lot of free time. On average so far since the end of school I haven’t had a day off. I live with my sister (rent free, at her insistence) and her kids for the summer. I’d promised the kids I’d take them to see picahcu on my first night off. 

Last summer I met this amazing guy who is 24 and in training to fly F-18s for the Navy. We stayed in touch over text and social media but I haven’t seen him. Today he texted me that he was home for a week and wanted to know if I could go out with him. I told him about the date with my niece and nephew and he said “please don’t cancel with them, that sounds really important” (swoooon to not being selfish). But then I started calling all of my jobs and there is almost no way for me to get another night off this week while he’s here in town. 

I love my niece and nephew so much but we’ll have other opportunities to go see a movie but they may not understand in the short term. But as it looks now this may be my only night for the next few months to go out with this massive crush.

c1toby	2019-06-17 21:51:42	Tunksten69	AITAH? Moving out while roommate is abroad	"I am a student in my early twenties. I have been renting a room from a person I vaugely knew at the time. However, I have a girlfriend, and I found myself spending more and more time at her place. We had vague plans of getting a place together, but didn't plan a date for this. However, last week a room in the same corridor as my gf became vacant and I got it. I told my roommate as soon as I knew I got the room.

Here's the catch: My roommate had just moved abroad for a few months the moment I told her I was going to move. She mentioned she was going abroad months ago, but didn't tell me the exact date. She also didn't remind me in the weeks before she went. I only found out my roommate was flying out a few days before, because a mutual friend told me.

When I told my roommate I was moving out, she started telling me she can't find another roommate while she is abroad, and that we had agreed that I would tell her if  I was planning on moving before she went abroad. But we never agreed to that, though she may have mentioned it casually. She also got mad because supposedly  I had promised to water her plants while she was away. She also started telling me how hard her life had been the last few weeks (glass in her foot, bruised finger, infected lung, fights with her mom) and how upset she was by me moving out on such short notice on top of that.

I got super mad by her response because I felt like she was guilt-tripping me. Pissed, my gf read through the rental contract my roommate had made and found out I have most likely been paying too much rent because the gas/electricity/etc. costs are very high. So I sent my roommate a stone cold email telling her that I want to see the bills for proof, or that I won't pay last month's rent. 

I know my roommate doesn't have much money to spare after moving abroad, but I'm not exactly rich either. AITAH?

edit: Sorry a bit late. She send me the bills. Turns out the numbers do add up. I apologized and  said I will pay the extra month rent. She did get really mad at me and started blaming me for a lot of small things that happened a long time ago. I think I will cut ties with her after the contract ends."

c1to6j	2019-06-17 21:51:21	galaxysoul1	WIBTA for telling a guy to stop spending my money and being lazy and insecure?	"I am 21F, and I am almost official with a guy (24).

Known him for a few months, and he seemed fun. I am about to get my degree, and he is currently unemployed and has no degree. I only point this out because this is a very sore subject for him.I have no issue with this. 

He lost his job a month after we met and has been basically unemployed since then. He works parttime but that is only two days a week he says it doesn’t pay much.

We’ve been on a couple dates &I always prefer to pay for my food, & if I do have extra money at the time, I don’t mind footing the entire bill. However, he has become very expectant. He even used the fact that he paid for the first date to pin the costs of a later date on me. I don’t mind this, except he keeps making it seem like my plans for this date have to be HUGE, or it will be disappointing. Some new costs have taken a large chunk out of my monthly budget, & I have begun to not want to go out with him because of the financial pressure. (Again, I don't mind paying for myself and I have paid for him at certain times.)

I admit that my parents do have money, but I don’t demand more than they give me. So I have that allowance and my tutoring income. it really is more than enough for me. He keeps making it seem like his loss of income means that I should be willing to support him or pay for things. He constantly makes comments like

“It would be so cool if you sent me some pizza right now.” Or “buy me this”, along with a pic. 

“I really feel like eating (insert restaurant) but I’m low on funds”.

Every time we go out, and he always wants to go to expensive places, he always only has like five dollars with him. He thinks money is a non-issue for me, so he feels entitled to spend mine. He isn’t making an effort to find a new job, and always talks about how difficult his life is and how he doesn’t have any opportunities. All he has done is message a couple friends & ask them if they can help him out with a job.

He also gets incredibly jealous of my male friends, especially when he finds out that they bought me food or took care of the bill when my friends and I go out. He seems to be feeling inadequate but I don’t think thats my fault.

Also,instead of congratulating me on any achievements, he just compares his own life to mine and laments over his own downfalls. He uses his insecurities to try & make me feel guilty for moving forward in life.

I have come to a point where I want to tell him that he should really try & find a job, that my money is mine & that he needs to deal with his insecurities without dumping them on me to make me feel guilty over my successes. WIBTA if I did this? I dont know if im just being ridiculous. I care about him but I cant deal with him

I also cant just ditch him because he says he is depressed & without me his life is a “dark place”. I dont want to cause any emotional problems for him because he does have the potential & mindset to do something drastic.

First, I feel more like a bag of jokes then q real friend in the group, and anytime I call them out on stuff, they always back themselves up and never own up to their faults. That's besides the point.

They posted my car on Offer Up, and I started getting texts and calls from people about it. I had to tell people it was fake, and people got mad, and threats were involved, yet I still don't know if it was all them just pranking me, or actual pissed off people.

The worst part is, this lead to a scammer attempting to steal all my passwords, info, regarding banking, my emails, everything. It happened because they tried to login to my Gmail account, that has all my info, and I got an alert, and was sent a Google verification code. The scammer then used the fake car ad to ask for that code to prove I was ""real"". I saw right through it but it's the attempt at all my info that scared me. 

At this point, I gave my closest friend in the group my take on how fucked up this is. I'm super pissed and now they are saying, ""Hey are you so mad, it's no big deal"".

Note: The car is my parents, in their name, and in the message threats, my dad's name was used.

c1tlzk	2019-06-17 21:46:17	amberanthropophage	WIBTA for asking a work colleague and former friend to stop contacting me outside of work?	"I work with a former friend and roommate. Before we were roommates I would say we were very good friends. I certainly trusted this person, which is saying a lot because I don't let very many people into my life. We had shared a lot of thoughts and experiences as close friends and colleagues as we were in the same field.

 Our roommate relationship ended about a year ago when they gave me 30 days notice to move out (we live in an urban area with very high rents which require large deposits). Things had seemed a little weird for a while before that, but it took me a long time to realize that they had misrepresented the room situation, had lots of trauma from past relationships and issues with boundaries and space. I tried my best to keep the move out civil, though I was frankly pissed. 

I made clear my plans for move out via text, confirmed that I would be repainting my room (even though by law in our city, that is the landlord's responsibility), confirmed when my deposit would be returned, etc. 

They preceded to do several petty things, keeping portions of my security deposit, accusing me of breaking or stealing items in the home (just, no), ignoring a simple request to return an item I forgot in the home(they live 10 minutes from our shared work, so it would not have been a significant hardship). The tone of all their communication was just mean and misguided and I struggled to remain logical. It hurt a lot that this person was willing to give up several years of friendship over a couple of broken plates. 

In the end, I felt our friendship had ended. In hindsight I realized I had made an error in trusting this person and that they did not care about me. 

At this point we still work together, though not closely, so I do my best to simply ignore this person and be professional.

Sorry for the long read, here's my question:

A manager reached out to me and this person to do a small employee presentation because we are part of a volunteer education group in our company. The other person I work with, bowed out of the group about a year ago and has not participated since. They were the first person to respond and agreed.

Now I feel angry, as I have worked hard in the group this past year and participated a lot. I doubt this person is even up to date on the training materials. 

Today they texted me on my personal cell phone asking if I have done any work on the presentation for tomorrow. (The meeting is in fact next week). 

No one else at work even has my personal cell phone number as I do not give it out to my colleagues, preferring to keep my personal life separate. 

It's hard for me to see if I'm acting logically, because as much as I hate to admit it I think I am still hurt and angry about the way our friendship ended.

I'm 15F, going into 10th grade. My mom, who is trying to get in touch with the mother of the girl I used to be really close with, she is 13 at the moment. Her mother is going through a tough time, recently divorced, lost a few jobs, failed child certification and is facing false accusations at her work. She is not getting any money in because of her injury. I've known her mother and the other girl for 7 years, we used to be so close, until she had to move in someone's basement because she couldn't afford the condo fee. After living in a few basements, the girl, let's call her S, goes to her mom's on the weekends which is a storage unit. She has seen some gross stuff there such as a guy shitting all over the floor, drunk, and rolling in it. Poor girl. Anyways, my mother wanted to invite her over, last minute and at random without warning. I got pissed with my mother because I am not in the mood to do anything. She should have checked in with me in my opinion, you can't just invite someone over at random without letting other family members know! It's awkward with the girl since we haven't talked much in the past 4 years. There's nothing to talk about , she's going on about boys and crop tops, while I'm trying to find ways to pass my upcoming AP and IB tests. She's more social than I am and we have different opinions on things. 


Am I the asshole for getting angry with my mother for not asking me first ? She may be my mother,  but she should still talk to me first and see if I wanted to hang or not rather than pushing it"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So I thought he was a prankster and I would prank him back. So I created an excel workbook with some code in it that basically doesn’t let you close it. You have to force close it with task manager or go in developer and delete the code. Every time you click x you get a message box saying “imagine if you couldn’t close excel :^)” along with making the user e mail themself “Why are you talking to yourself??”

I thought she just wanted me to chat with her during the traffic, so i told her I’m actually at the gym, I’ll call u back later maybe send me couple voice messages? She cuts me immediately.


I call her after I’m done, no response. Sent her a message asking her if she’s in class yet, and she responds 1 hour later saying she is late and just super aggressive language and saying that I don’t care, what if she was in an accident blah blah, I would never know if she died, etc. 


Apparently she wanted me to google search for her whether there was an accident or just traffic , what to do etc, because she didn’t want to surf the internet on her phone on the road. But she didn’t tell me that in the call (blames me to not care enough to ask) I honestly assumed she just wanted to chat, and if she wanted to take another route, she could always use Waze.


I explained to her my rationale and situation, but she wasn’t taking any of it and just full on bashes me and deletes me. I was a bit angry she  would make this situation sound so bad so I couldn’t keep it all smileys, but def no shit talking on my side.

&#x200B;

If there are a ton of cars waiting to fill up I will get my gas, then drive across the lot to a parking spot, park, then walk into the store portion to get caffeine, maybe a candy bar or whatever. If I am there and the place is dead I will sometimes leave my car at the pump while I run in. Since there aren't many other customers there there are no lines for pumps and my conclusion is that nobody cares.

&#x200B;

But this morning...

&#x200B;

I was one of maybe four or five cars fueling up - so over a dozen unused pumps. I leave my car where it was and run inside. I come out and there is a commercial van waiting behind me, driver. There are still over a dozen unused pumps - the two bays on either side of me, so maybe ten feet away to either side, are both unused, with the gas nozzle on the same side. Instead of pulling behind me and getting pissed they could have gone to either pump and had no waiting. (I considered the possibility that they pulled in behind me so they would have an excuse to stay in their van for an extra minute or three, but how plausible is that?)

c1tdpx	2019-06-17 21:27:15	Throwaway14088041	AITA for asking out my best friends crush?	"Throwaway because people know my real reddit account. Names changed. There’s me (23M), my roommate and best friend Roger (24M), and the girl Gwen (23F). Roger and I have been living together as roommates for around two years now. I’m more of an anti-social type of person, with him being more outgoing. I’ve never really had romantic relationships. He’s been in a few different relationships and he always seems interested in three to four different people at any given time.

&#x200B;

Recently when hanging out with a bunch of other mutual friends, I was introduced to Gwen. She’s friends with most everyone who was there except me, so we chatted a bunch. It was a good time, but nothing really interesting happened. I know that Roger has been interested in her, going out to do stuff with her, but it hasn’t really been going anywhere. For my part, I didn’t think anything of the interaction until a few weeks ago.

&#x200B;

We’re all hanging out at a pool with a smaller group. Alcohol is involved, but nobody is really drunk. We’re playing “Never have I ever” and I come out with “Never have I ever kissed a girl”. She looks over at me though and says “Really? Not even once?” and I just reply with it never ended up happening to me. To my surprise she swims over and kisses me with a semi-long actual kiss. After  I just kinda awkwardly say “Welp, I guess I can’t use that one anymore” laugh, and move on. I’m not one to jump to conclusions, so I just assumed she was being kind, though I did appreciate it. Later, we’re playing Truth or Dare and it’s my turn. I go with dare, and she dares me to kiss her. At this point I’m like “Okay, I’m still not convinced there’s any real attraction here, but now I’m on the fence”. So we kiss again and the night continues as normal. We talk some more and exchange facebooks.

&#x200B;

We start talking on facebook. Conversation goes well, and I ask her if she would want to go bowling with Roger, me, and another mutual friend. She agrees, and I go to set it up with the other two. Roger immediately gets suspicious of me, and asks if I have any plans of trying to go out with her. I reply honestly with “I don’t have any plans, I just like hanging out with her.” He proceeds to jokingly say he’d “kill” me if I do anything, that I’d be breaking the bro code, and that he’s been trying to go out with her. I laugh, say she’s free to go out with whomever she feels like. He’s not super happy about that, but drops it.

&#x200B;

Bowling goes well, and everything was smooth. Next day I decide to see what level of interest she has by asking her if she wants to grab some food. She agrees, and we set-up a time for later. This is still a phase for me where I’m not sure if she wants to be good friends, or anything more. I just like talking to her and want to see where this goes. But I do feel like I’m being a dick to my roommate by asking her out and pursuing this while he expressed that he was interested.

c1tdjk	2019-06-17 21:26:53		AITA for not walking my dog every day.	"I am currently living with a friend out in the “boonies” between living situations. She owns a lot of land and rents it out to people with horses. There is a complete barn/horse section that’s really beautiful. People even ride a trail on her property.

Katie (the friend) used to raise goats and pigs, but stopped when her boyfriend moved in. He turned the old corral for the goats (about half an acre of land) into a dog run. He breeds cattle dogs and trains them. 

Right now he’s between litters and training a few dogs. So my dogs and Katie’s dogs chill in there most of the day. They run around to the point of being exhausted every night. There are about eight dogs total (outside of the trained dogs who have a different corral). 

The only place to walk the dogs is a trail with rattle snakes. I spend all my time with my dog that I can but have never felt he isn’t getting exercise chasing sheep dogs around all day and swimming in their pool. 

But my sister had complained it’s not good to leave a dog “locked up all day” when in reality the dogs get more exercise on the farm than they did when I lived in a duplex.

So what happened was I bought him the game so we could play together. In fact he asked for the game, so I had no clue he would be mad about it. So what he did next was type in the ending for the game. when I asked him to stop he then proceeded to copy and paste it. So I warned him to stop or I would be blocking him.

c1tbfq	2019-06-17 21:22:25	20menwhomadeaslip	AITA for not giving my dad a Father’s Day gift after he wouldn’t play my music at my grad party?	"Right off the bat, I know this sounds extremely entitled and bratty of me, I’m just trying to see if I’m at least somewhat justified here. 

So my parents and I have been planning a grad party for me graduating high school. Not super expensive, but still, a few hundred dollars was involved. My parents also told me to make a music playlist of my favorite songs to play at the party, which I actually got really excited about. (The final playlist I made was twice as long as the party was gonna be). I showed my dad how to play the playlist, and he was all ready to play it

My dad and I both love music, and he knows how much music means to me. Unfortunately, once the party started, I noticed he was very obviously playing his own music. I went up to him and said, “Hey dad can you play my music?”  As he was showing another dude his speaker setup. He pretended like he was going to, then said “Nah I don’t think so.” Laughed, then went back to talking to the dude. I was pissed, and went back with my friends and had a great time.

About an hour later, he yells out that I could play my music now, to which I say “Nah I don’t think so” and continued hanging out with my friends. He’d already been rude to me, so I didn’t really talk to him for the rest of the night. When we got home I thanked my parents for the party, and said I had a great time.

The next day, my dad called me out in the backyard to work on the deck. About halfway through, I told him I was hurt about what he said  yesterday, and that I found it pretty rude. We talked about it a bit, and he apologized, saying “even adults can be selfish sometimes” which sounded a bit off to me. 

I was still annoyed at him, so, like the title says, I didn’t get him anything for Father’s Day. That night he started complaining to my mom about how unappreciative I am, and how I couldn’t even let that go. “Wow you couldn’t play your music, big deal, meanwhile you didn’t even get me anything for Father’s Day, you know what? I’m not gonna go to your college orientation. What am I getting out of it?”We all bickered for a bit until my dad and I stormed off. Now we’re barely speaking.

Am I The Asshole? I know it was rude of me, and my dads not a bad dad by any means, but I just felt oddly offended by the whole ordeal.

TL;DR: my dad didn’t play my music at my grad party, after knowing how much it meant to me, and even though he apologized, proceeded to go back on it and call me unappreciative and said he won’t go to my college orientation."	Asshole	0	0	71.0	43.0	0.0	0.0

c1ta5y	2019-06-17 21:19:34	MajesticallyAwkward6	AITA for breaking up with a guy because he wouldn’t discuss serious subjects due to his anxiety, didn’t appear to accept my physical disability and we only kissed 4 times in 8 months	"First post ever so apologies if I break any rules or format something wrong etc

Background first, I’m (30f) chronically ill following a serious car accident. I am in constant pain and suffer severe fatigue as well as having PTSD, I rarely leave the house and when I do, I’m in a wheelchair and it badly takes it out of me. I have to rest for days after, I can manage 1to2 social things a week

A year ago I decided to try and improve my social life + try dating, I met X (30m) on a dating site. X had never tried dating at all and had good reason that had left him with terrible anxiety over relationships, but was also trying to better himself. So we went out for dinner and this continued almost weekly for 8 months.

My doubts started when we finally got around to adding each other on Facebook at the 3 month(ish) mark. I found a post he’d posted about a year before we met that stated he was asexual. In the whole 8 month period we kissed 4 times. Several times during the 8 months I tried to ask him about the Facebook post, or how I could support him into progressing physically and emotionally with the relationship or about what he wanted for the future/what we were (in a relationship or not, exclusive or not etc). Every time I brought up any of this he’d either immediately change the subject, ignore me or literally run away. I put it down to the serious anxiety he had and let it go over and over again.

One week he messaged me every single day asking “what are we doing on date night” and getting the same answer (I’m too sick, plus I’ve got my daughters sports day and a community event where there was going to be a memorial for my Nana who died in July). By the 4th day I snapped that he wasn’t listening to me and taking my issues into account and that I needed some space to think. Which he did give me.

A week later I call him to tell him I had decided this wasn’t working and I didn’t want to continue trying to make something work that didn’t seem to be progressing at all when he wasn’t prepared to communicate. His response was “fine, but I advise you to be more direct with your next partner”. This shocked me and I just said “ok” and hung up. The whole reason I felt I had to end things was because he refused to be direct with me at any point, and I had no idea we were “partners” because he refused to have that conversation multiple times. 

I really agonised over that decision because I really liked him. But on reflection I felt kind of like he was using me as an experiment to see if he was asexual or not. He didn’t do anything that upset me on purpose, it was the anxiety. But he still didn’t get that I couldn’t always fit his schedule.

AITA? Should I have stuck it out longer?

I find it pretty gross that she's pushing her stance onto children on the taxpayer's dime and her twitter feed is FULL of the worst parts of pro-choice garbage.

c1t9gs	2019-06-17 21:17:59	VacaTHrowsWay	AITA for telling my husband not to invite his friend on our trip	"Our friend's 40th birthday is coming up in the fall and we (my self, my husband, and birthday girls husband) have planned a surprise 4 day trip to Vegas to celebrate. We asked her for a list of friends to invite to a ""birthday party"", we booked our flights/hotel, picked out some group things to do along with lots of free time for her to pick where to go and what to do, and we made an invite with all the info and passed it out to her list of friends to join the four of us if they are able to. She still doesn't know about the trip, we are planning on surprising her once we've got more details planning and confirmed all the bookings.

A couple days ago my husband got to hang out with a close friend of his who lives very far away from us and mentioned the Vegas trip and said it would be fun to have him there, he should totally come too. My husband tells me to send the info over to him  and I'm a little surprised at him and say ""You can't just invite someone to her birthday trip, that is weird. Why would you invite him?""

He thinks i'm making a big deal out of nothing and that it will be fine. His stance is that Birthday Girl and her husband have met this friend before and they all instantly clicked with similar personalities, and it would objectively be a fun group to be on this trip with.

I agree that this friend is a great person and a lot of fun, but i can't shake the feeling it will come across weird and take away from her birthday. He wasn't on the list of people she thought of when it came to celebrating her birthday, and we should be focusing on making it a fun trip for her, its not meant to be a gathering of people my husband and I would have fun with in Vegas, that could be another trip later.

Also, neither one of us used this point to aid either side of the argument, but the birthday girl and her husbands portion of the trip (flights/hotel) is being paid for by us as a birthday present to her. The entire trip was our idea and we had approached her husband (who is also our good friend too) with it.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for not wanting my husband to invite his friend? Is he the asshole for assuming it is okay to invite him? Are we both missing a bigger picture here?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for your perspectives. This is definitely not the hill I want to die on, and I care about everyone involved here and want no hurt feelings or tension. I'm going to let this one go but I will have a conversation with my husband about how I know he is excited and yes he is right that this will be a fun group to go with, but to please not invite anyone else without consulting me or at the very least the birthday girl's husband first. I will also give the birthday girls husband a heads up and make sure its alright that this other friend might attend (he hasn't even said yes, this was just an invitation.. so yes i think i got a little ahead of myself here too). I'll make sure she feels special and like this trip is about her regardless of who else is there."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1t9db	2019-06-17 21:17:47	CallsignTheShark	WIBTA if I asked my GF her symptoms and to wait to go to urgent care?	"Things happen, and my gf believed she got a UTI about a 2 months ago, she waited a few weeks to go to urgent care(doesn't have health insurance so hospitals are a no-go), and at that point she was living with her parents and was able to pay for her visit then. The only symptom she told me about was frequent urge to pee. She didn't have to describe symptoms to the nurse so I never knew if there was anything else. The doctor came in, shamed us for being sexually active, and then said that there was an abnormally high amount of white blood cells in her urine leading him to conclude that she had a UTI. She took her antibiotics as prescribed but we continued to have sex throughout the process and as far as I knew, things were a-okay.

Since then, she has moved into my apartment with me, and I have become the supporter of us. I have been working full time hours and going to class just to make ends meet. I'm not trying to gain pity, I am trying to explain that money is tight and I need to make dollars stretch. Last night she tells me that she needs to go to urgent care again for a UTI but  she has been unemployed since December, so I would have to be the one who pays up. This wouldn't be an horrible except that I have a limited amount of withdrawals from my savings each month and I have hit my limit already. I have had a few emergency payments this month and my GFs car was towed so it has been a rough month for me financially. On top of all of this, my car is requiring a jump every other time I drive it, and it's not worth fixing so I am also faced with buying a car.

Today she tried to initiate sex, and I told her that we needed to wait until she was healthy because I can't afford to pay for a third urgent care visit. She immediately was livid and told me that she was upset that I thought she was disgusting. We have been barely speaking all day, and now I'm sitting at work still a little irked. I know that she knows her body better than anyone, but she is a huge complainer (will yell 'OUCH' if I drop something as light as my JUUL on her leg.) She also believes that because my parents are rich, I have nothing to worry about money-wise, and told me yesterday that I ""don't really have to worry about money at all bc my parents can save me if I'm ever in trouble.""  I will have no money left after this visit for the rest of the month because my paychecks all go to my savings account, and I don't have enough cash on hand to pay for gas and groceries.

I already told her I would pay for the visit, so I won't back out of that, but I am getting very frustrated with her disregard for my financial situation. WIBTA if I asked what symptoms she is having and asked her to wait until she experiences something more indicative of a UTI than having to pee a lot? Obviously if she is experiencing any kind of pain I will take her immediately, but if she just has to get out of bed to pee ""more than usual"" I think that she is okay to wait."

Anyways a new girl got hired and to make the story short, she does NOTHING and when the manager is around they go in his office and lock it, I know because I am a training supervisor and need to get in to count the drawers (been training for 8 weeks when it's only 4 weeks without a pay raise, pretty much doing his work to close the store) they take a while to open and it's always them two in there. Anyways he has been very unfair to everyones hours and giving it to her, while everyone complains that she doesn't help at all instead dissapears most of the shift.  The assistants don't get involved but know something is up. The next day the next crew has to finish whatever job she had for the day. 

Anyways time for inventory, which is done at 5 am by store managers/assistant managers ""only"", he made me and an assistant manager do it all. He comes in at 8 with the girl and go straight in the office and do not help at all, we stay there doing that almost all day. The assistant manager tells me to mark things very low to screw him over, so I do, especially the expensive things. A couple of weeks later the district manager comes in and has a talk with all management because the store lost a lot of $$. The store manager ends up getting fired and the assistant gets promoted... Now I feel bad that I helped the assistants agenda, but he is a way better manager after all. As soon as he got fired the one girl ended up quitting, last I heard that manager hit rock bottom and his wife ended up divorcing him. He got depressed and was the last anyone's heard of him...

c1t8j1	2019-06-17 21:15:56	DatGuyNerd	WIBTA: If I told my aunt to stop babytalking to me?	"My dad, my brother and I have lived in my uncle's and aunt's house since I was like 6 years old because a divorce, and my mom got to keep the house.  
So my aunt, since she had no children, started to babytalk to me, you know, misspronunciating words and using a very very VERY high note tone, you know, as if I was a baby or a pet.  


I'm now 24, almost 25. She still talks to me like this, she has done it for almost 19 years non-stop, infront of my friends, of my family, and to be honest I'm getting pissed at it. It's embarrasing, she talks to me as she talks to my cat. Hell, she even treats my 6 year old nephews in a more mature way that she treats me.  
I know she sees me as her son, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that she gave us a roof and everything, but it's stressing me out so badly. I get home from work and she starts talking to me in that squeaky voice and immediately drives me crazy.  
My dad already knows this and he agrees with me, he noticed that it pissed me off by himself, but for some reason my aunt won't see it.  


Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop with the babytalking? I'm a grown man, and I never said a word because I was trying to be respectful and waiting for her to realize I'm not a kid anymore, but it's been 19 years."	Not the A-hole	0	0	22.0	18.0	0.0	0.0

c1t7ui	2019-06-17 21:14:26	RaBbEx	AITA for asking my dad for financial support?	"So my dad and I don't have a real relationship, since my mom moved out of country when I was 3 and they were already splitted up before I was born, I only had 3 times in my life real contact with him and that was with 11, 12, and 14 where I did vacations with him in my birthland.

We kinda stopped having contact after that without real reason( so we both are bad with phone calls and we had a language barrier since I was really bad at spanisch and did not have good English skills)
Over the past 19 years if my lofe he payed like 1 year of child support and stopped it after that.

As of now, I'm about to start college and will be moving out, while being able to kinda live with what I have it would actually be a huge financial help if he would pay some support and through my mom I came to the idea of actually asking him. For it.

So I need to say that I am really a bit unsure about asking him, since Its difficult to not have a tad of expectations and I kinda know that with him denying that (he is really good earning and I am not really asking for much, like 500€ and he is earning 10k+) I would feel hurt by it, and I would kinda cut him off entirely after thatin my mind. (even if it's understandable that he is not willing to pay someone he barely knows money, even if it's his kinda like son) 

But I can't help myself justify me asking him for money, since through something like 3 years of absolute no contact without feeling like I am in the wrong for that

So AITA for asking him to help me fund my bachelor?


Edit: visiting him in any way Is more than hard since i would need to fly from Germany to Chile and that would cost me around 1400 euros

And we did not have any stress between us before, and nobody really cut the other off (I would suppose?well atleast I did not)

&#x200B;

So I've been friends with this guy, call him ""Alex"" for now. So Alex and I have been friends for 4 years.  We both smoke weed but I never drank or did anything else, not even coffee or cigarettes, but he would smoke and drink. Never was a problem and he was always chill. 

&#x200B;

Everything had been pretty normal so far and Alex had never done anything bad to me.  So one day Alex came by to play some ps4 and hangout for a bit. I got a text in which I had to meet my sister and would be back in an hour. Alex said he would keep playing some game and I saw no problem with it. I've left him alone in my room/place multiple times with nothing wrong. By the time I got back I noticed my ps4 with my games and controller were gone. I thought he took it over to his place (bigger TV) but no matter how much I knocked there was no answer. I tried getting a hold of him for 2 days and I was getting increasingly more agitated and angry. I found out from one of our mutual friends that he went over there to borrow $ for some hard drugs cause his uncle passed away a week earlier. So I messaged him and told him im sorry about his uncle but he better not have sold my ps4 for drugs. He simply replied ""sorry im an addict"". I've tried to get a hold of him at his place but theres never an answer. 

&#x200B;

Im pretty pissed that he chose to steal from me and not own up to it but some of our mutual friends have said that I should be more sympathetic towards him. That hes having a rough time and simply made a bad choice. Im not too sure what to think. AITA for not being sympathetic towards the friend that blatantly stole from me the moment I looked away?

c1t5u4	2019-06-17 21:09:38	orions_belch	AITA for leaving my sister alone in nyc?	"UPDATE: so she met me for pizza and when I walked in, she acted like nothing ever happened and asked me what we were doing for desert. I think I might overthink things as I’m not used to “bickering” like she is. Usually my arguments are infrequent and very severe.  I was expecting a ESH to be completely honest.  I’ve had some anger issues in the past and have been very hesitant to allow myself to get mad over anything as I continue to try and improve myself (i.e is this something I should be angry about or is it something about which I am overreacting?) so I really appreciate yall’s outside perspectives.

ORIGINAL POST: So for some context, my sister (19) has been known to be a manipulator. She frequently moves the goal post and uses guilt to get her way in my mom’s household. If someone calls her out on it, she will gaslight them etc. basically just a poster child for manipulation tactics.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, I (22f) am a very prideful, wary individual. I have admittedly taken things too far in the past reprimanding someone when they “try to pull a fast one on me.”

So, my sister and I have been in NYC for the past week. (Long enough to learn the public transportation system) and I wanted to hit a specific place for food before it closed for the evening. She said she needed to go back and change shoes (she was wearing heels) which made me a little nervous about getting back to the restaurant in time but a sore foot is a sore foot so we went back to our place with the intent of just changing shoes. 

We get back to the place and she takes her extensions out, brushes her hair, wipes her makeup off, gets in the shower, showers for about 20 minutes, gets out, and lays in bed. I ask her to get dressed so we can go or I was going to leave her but she decides to hang out in bed a little longer before getting dressed. She puts her hair up and I go use the restroom and come back with key in hand to find her opening her makeup bag (she said she wouldn’t do her makeup as it takes forever in order for me to agree to waiting for her to shower) to put her face on. I told her that I was leaving, waited a couple minutes, and shit I left without a single word. I was angry with her for trying to treat me like she treats (and gets away with treating) our mother. She’s sent me a line of angry texts guilt tripping me, saying it was going to be my fault if anything happened to her, telling me I ruined the trip etc. 

This is her first time in nyc and while she knows the transportation system, she is not very self sufficient and part of me feels like a total scum bag for leaving my sister alone in NYC when our home is 3/4 of the way down the east coast. I just didn’t want to allow her to start pushing my boundaries and taking advantage of me. I’ve been working on reeling in my reactions to people’s disrespect and I am not sure if I over reacted on this one or if I did the right thing. I’m filled with a mix of anger and guilt at the moment.

c1t5pf	2019-06-17 21:09:22		AITA for criticizing my friend’s poor choices in life?	"My friend is one of those chronic complainers and she always complains about how hard her life is and how broke she is. Mind you, she only has insurance to pay, phone bill, and $200 for monthly rent at her grandparents’ house (but they recently agreed to reduce that). She also has two jobs. She was given a $10K in student loans and she spent all of it on stupid crap, then ended up dropping out of school, so now she’s $10K in debt. If she hadn’t spent all of the money, she could’ve sent it right back to the government and she wouldn’t be in debt. So she’s trying to pay it off but is still very picky about what jobs she wants to work and will find reasons why she might not like a job even though it’s higher in pay and full time. Now she blew $5000 (on credit, digging an even deeper financial hole for herself) for this book she wants to self-publish because she thinks she’ll magically become famous and make a lot of money from it. For years she’s been telling people she’s a published author even though she hasn’t published a single book. 

Since I’m the one who has to hear about it all the time, I decided it’s time to be real with her. I told her that it’s her fault she’s in debt (she blames her family for pressuring her to go even though she’s an adult in her mid 20s), that it’s her fault she spent all of her student loans. And now instead of being patient and getting a job that will actually make her money, she’s taking out thousands of dollars of more loans for a book that may or may not become a success. I told her that I hate to see her constantly dig a deeper hole for herself due to her poor choices and spending habits, and she’s not moving smart. 

Well, now she’s pretty angry with me now. I really didn’t want to offend her. It’s just that I’m the one who has to hear her complain about her life and financial issues all the time and I thought maybe I could knock some sense into her. I hate to be the friend that just agrees and supports you no matter what.  AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I’m almost 19 years old My parents divorced the fall before I graduated from high school, and I don’t live with either of my parents right now. The reason why my parents got divorced was my dad cheating on my mom. I was depressed for a while after that. 
I blame my dad 100% for turning my entire life upside down. My mom basically turned into a different person once she found out about his unfaithfulness, and so did I. He didn’t put up a court fight over who got what in the divorce or anything, but it’s not like either of them could afford to hire lawyers for a long court battle anyway. 
I found out later that my whole life had been a lie. I thought that I was part of a happy family, but instead my parents had been having issues the entire time they were married and my dad had been putting a financial strain on us by siphoning off money every time he cashed a paycheck. 

Since the divorce he has been acting strangely kind toward me and my sister. He tries to spend a lot of time with us (something he didn’t do much before) and he takes us out to eat and to see movies pretty frequently (also something we didn’t do much before). He’s apologized for what he did and he’s already said that he couldn’t make it up to me but he would try. That’s the background within the limit. 
Anyway, yesterday was fathers day and I didn’t get him a present or anything and I didn’t see him at all. I don’t think he deserves anything after what he did and I don’t quite buy the whole “nice dad” act yet. To me fathers day is just a day to remember how mine destroyed my family. Maybe I’m being too bitter. Maybe he deserves some kind of recognition that he’s my dad. I don’t know. 
AITA?


Edit: everyone seems to think that I avoid my dad all the time. This couldn’t be further from the truth. I see him several times a week, talk to him, hang out, ect. I try to let him bond with me and get closer. I ONLY AVOIDED HIM ON FATHERS DAY. I had some guilt over it, and I’m wondering if I should feel guilty."	Not the A-hole	0	0	42.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I had just gotten to my boyfriends house. We went into his room, and we were talking and as I was in the middle of talking he walked out and went to the bathroom. This annoyed me, and when he came back I told him I felt like that was super disrespectful and rude of him. He rolled his eyes and played on his phone. After that I asked him numerous times if he could stop playing on his phone and just have a conversation with me (he didn’t).

I told him he had been super rude and I wasn’t sure why he wouldn’t just apologize and we could move on (I tend to have to ask him for apologies when he hurts my feelings). He rolled his eyes and said “sorry.” I told him that wasn’t genuine at all, and he said “If you apologize for being a bitch i’ll apologize for whatever it is you’re upset about.”

After that I asked him one more time to please get off his phone to talk to me and he threw his phone across the room, stormed out, and slammed his door.

c1t3lr	2019-06-17 21:04:27	anonymous_posts	AITA for asking a teacher hosting a class election if an election opponent was cheating.	"Some background:
This was back in 5th grade, so it was a long time ago. The librarian decided to create a senator election for both 4th and 5th graders in which each grade would have an election to pick two representatives for per grade. There was a set of rules, however the only one I remember and that is important to the story is that there is no bribery to gain votes.

The story:
So at the start of the election everyone running could place posters in hallways and make speeches during select times. However, it escalated from this when this girl I’ll call Sam(not real name for obvious reasons) decided she would hand out candy to the class with her campaign slogan attached. Both my friend and I were running in the race too as allies (Sam also had a alliance with someone). We both thought it violated the rules of the election and decided we were going to ask if the candy violated the rules. (TBH we hoped she would get in trouble cause she was a teachers pet and got on our nerves, plus we were at a disadvantage because the number of girls outweighed the number of boys in the class.) We asked the teacher and he said to our dismay it didn’t violate the rules. However, this is where the real drama starts.  It turns out that a girl who was friends with Sam heard us telling the teacher about the candy and started spreading that both my friend and I were trying to get Sam in trouble. I decided I would deny the claims but not go any further in trying to accuse Sam for bribery because I didn’t want people to go after me due to her popularity any more than they were. My friend on the other hand included that he thought she was bribing people in a speech of his and this sparked outrage against my friend. Long story short, my friend lost early in the election and I made it to the primary. We both made a deal before hand that if one lost before the other they would be vice-runner/campaign manager to the one still in the race. So with my friend being allied with me I was pretty screwed because the majority sided with Sam in the whole scandal. This lead to my loss, but I’m still surprised I made it that far in the race.
So, am I in the wrong for accusing her for bribery, but then lying when asked if I made that accusation?

He gave me so much freedom and didn't influence my opinions, that I had began to see that my best friend is kinda toxic.

EB = The ex boyfriend and TF = Toxic Friend, I shouldn't have to abbreviate me.

Anyways, I never have been great at confrontation. So I feel maybe I could be the teeniest bit of an AH. I never said anything I just... avoided making plans with her. She would accuse me for ""ditching her"" when we one: didn't even have plans and two: I already had plans with EB. There were a few times we actually ended up making plans, which I thought were actually plans. But then I would see that she was at her boyfriend's or he's over and she knows I'm not a fan of being a third wheel, . I've made it clear but then she says ""but I use to third wheel you and EB all the time."" To clarify, I always told her I didn't like to have a third wheel, I thought of it as an invasion on mine and EBs privacy. Lets bring this story up to today's date, shall we?

So today I had sorta confronted it after we had made plans to have a sleepover at mine for the weekend, and I was coming home from a city that night, so I said yeah, sure. I didn't have plans. And at this point, I expected her to not show up. She didn't, what a surprise. I let it go. Now here's the tricky part, she does online school so she can work throughout the day and I actually have a schedule. I gotta go to school, and she always asks if I want so skip and hangout. I don't want a detention, right? I say I can't and she just says ""ok."" Expected reaction, so anyways today she sent a few ""best friend memes,"" about partners in class or that ""when your best friend get's a boyfriend memes.""

Guess what I said?

""Can't relate lmao,"" TF said ""oh?"" as if there was no reason for it. Then I confronted her about it. She threw ""you always ditched me for EB,"" in my face. And no I didn't. I just always had plans with EB before I did with her, and when me and TF did actually I would walk out the door and notice she had cancelled without telling me before hand.

So at this point, I don't know if I'm the AH because she seems to believe I have no reason to be upset. Is this TF's way of giving me back ""Karma,"" am I overreacting, or is it time for me to find a new best friend?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	36.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

My grandma is not a bigot, but Donna defiantly is. She is very religious and anti gay etc. I was wearing a Black Sabbath shirt the other day and she complained. I brought my girlfriend over and closed the bedroom door and she complained. I called god “the big guy in the sky” and she said I was flippant. I’m not a religious person and I don’t give a shit about Donna’s opinions, but her nagging is annoying. 

I complained to my grandma, but she wouldn’t kick Donna out. So I decided to act outlandish in hopes of making Donna want to leave and stay in a hotel. I made fake sex noises when my gf and I were just chilling in my room.

c1t13u	2019-06-17 20:59:05	confusedindividual90	AITA My [M24] girlfriend [F23] got upset because I don’t like tattoos.	" 

Hello Reddit, I was wondering if I am the asshole in this situation:

I have never liked tattoos (I don’t have any). I really don’t mind if my friends, or anyone gets them, but it’s a preference that I don’t date women with tattoos. My girlfriend knows this (because we’ve talked about it before), but lately she’s been pushing me to “accept” that she wants one.

I told her that of course it’s her choice, because it’s her body and her life. I have no control over that, but, since *she asked for my honest opinion*, I also let her know that I find them repulsive. And to be frank, I probably wouldn’t find her as attractive anymore, and would have difficulty taking her seriously as a potential life-partner (call me shallow, but looks do matter).

She got angry, and tried to make me feel bad about not liking them. Arguing that I was too conservative and such a view was counter to progress and yadda-yadda-yadda.

My stance was: look, you asked me for my opinion. I gave it to you. I admit I have no control over what you do, but to try and guilt me into feeling bad for not liking them is silly. Just because you like tattoos and I don’t doesn’t mean I’m evil.

So am I the asshole here?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c1t0az	2019-06-17 20:57:13		AITA for being mad at a friend when he went behind my back?	"On mobile, excuse the format.

I had liked this girl for a few weeks when a friend of mine who is close to her and me told me she was interested in me. Call him CF (close friend)

About two days later I asked her to lunch. She said yes. CF spent the next few days before we went to lunch teasing us whenever we were around him.

The day we went to lunch went smoothly, and after CF told me to keep texting and talking to her to show I was still interested.

That Saturday CF me the girl and 3 mutual freinds  hung out, before hand CF non stop told me to try and kiss/make out with the girl that night. I was feeling quite confident so I decided I'd try.

But it went down hill when one of our friends started crying. None of us knew why so CF and the girl I was into decided to walk her home and talk about it. So me and the other two headed home kinda worried. 

Three days later the girl I was into decided to drop the good ol' : I don't like you like that. I was baffled, from what CF said, she quite liked me the few days before as he non stop told me to keep going for her, so I had no idea why she said she wasn't into me.

Respecting her choice, I kinda distanced myself for a few days and talked to CF, but didnt get much.

That Saturday a mutual friend of all three of us (the girl, CF and I) had a party and we were all invited. During the party I talked to them both casually, untill I see them basically tongue fucking eachother in the corner. I was a bit surprised as it was 4 days after she told me she didn't like me but I couldn't be upset as it's her choice.

That night I find out that the Saturday when they walked the crying freind home, they made out inront of her place, and that was why she broke it off with me.

I'm in complete shock at this point as I've just found out CF hooked up with the girl he knew I was into three days after we went to lunch, lied about why she broke it off, didn't tell me after, but instead told a bunch of mutual friends who I found this out from.

I call him later that night fuming, I wasn't upset that he had gotten with the girl I was into, but because he did it behind my back, told everyone but me and encouraged me to pursue her when he knew it wouldn't work out. He said it was because she didn't want me to know and that he didn't want to hurt my feelings. I acted as best as I could over the phone call trying to understand why he did what he did, but was fucking livid after.

I've gotten some support but also a lot of shit for being mad with him, as 'It's his choice' and 'they owe you nothing'.

I'm not mad at the girl at all and have had some chats with her, but have been avoiding CF for a bit.

TL:DR My friend who helped me get a date with a girl goes behind my back and hooks up with her without me knowing while encouraging me to go for her, knowing it wouldn't work out. I am getting a lot of shit for being mad at him"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

For reasons I won't put on here, he ended up divorcing my Mom, and I'm told the situation during and after was quite ugly. I don't really remember a lot from that time directly, since I was so young back then (currently 23M now), but I remember that I felt unsafe around him. He'd play pranks on me that I just didn't understand and took harder than he meant them, he'd put me to work on his farm for hours (still does), he'd fight a lot with his second wife (I think... again, it was a while ago), and he'd often put me in situations where I was unsafe (i.e., I almost drowned once, and almost got poisoned eating bad berries, and almost got stung by a swarm of angry bees, et cetera). On top of that, he really didn't know how to relate or talk to a kid, and had me watching movies like THE MATRIX and the animated WATERSHIP DOWN while I was still in single digits. I just never felt like he was a real father to me. I hated going to his place, as per the custody agreement, and eventually stopped going more than maybe three times a year. When I was older, he'd also go on about the end of the world, and how the government was controlling everything, and we had to live off the grid to not be brain-washed sheeple. It was... hard. He never really did anything to try and make things easier for both of us... I don't think he even gets how he came across. He wasn't there to teach me to play catch, or help me with relationships, or do most of the rites of passage an American boy goes through with their fathers. Things got better after I became an adult, but then he got weird again after he married his third wife. He didn't tell me he married again until after the fact, like he was trying to hide the whole thing. He wasn't there for my college graduation. And even now, he keeps trying to indoctrinate me into his weird cult of conspiracies.  He claims he's done everything to try and get me to be around more... but the one thing he's never done is try to get to know me and respect me for who I am, rather than trying to change me into him. He's the last human being I want to be like, and I'm honestly afraid to be a father myself, because I don't want to put my hang-ups on a child the same way he seems to try to do with me. I don't know... should I be more forgiving of him? He's not right in the head, so it's not like he knows what he does. I'm trying to be better, and not just cut him out, but... I can't stand being around this man. I don't even really see him as a parent. I don't know what to think.	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1szzi	2019-06-17 20:56:29	SD_Native760	AITA for getting into a heated debate with someone about women claiming fathers day as well?	"Before those you start bashing me about gender and all that, actually put yourself in the position with an open mind. I am fully aware that there is a significant proportion of single mothers out there and give them tons of credit for the work they do. Raising a child isnt easy, let alone doing it by yourself. However, as a father who is deeply involved in raising my child, I feel that women should stop the nonsense of saying that they are entitled to fathers day as well. My reason being is that it takes away the meaning and purpose for us that actually appreciate that we get a day to get appreciation shown to us for what we do to provide and co-raise our kids. When I see Facebook posts from single parents who are women that say ""guess I get to celebrate being a parent twice,"" that really irks me because it isnt a second celebration, they had theirs. I have yet to see any single dads with custody say they get mothers day as well and with this whole gender equality thing going on in society today it's easy for men to plead that case but they dont. Maybe they do and I just dont see those posts but I haven't seen any. 

To go into my post title, yesterday I was out with my family and overheard two women near us talking about that they deserve to celebrate both mothers and fathers day because the baby daddy's for each of them left. If it was a simple comment i wouldve just left it but the way they were saying it was in an entitled tone like they ""had"" to get both just because they were a single parent. It's hard to explain but it rubbed me the wrong way and I made a comment. To save time, it went to a heated debate and the two women left cursing me out. My SO agrees with me but said I maybe took it too far. She want embarrassed or anything, just told me that I should've just left it after a few back and forth comments but other than that didnt care.

AITA for thinking that fathers day should be left only to those who actually act as a father to their kid(s)? 

Just to clarify, I'm not sexist, prejudice or any of that nonsense. I do commend single parents everywhere because it's not the child fault. This is not about being insensitive to ""gender roles"" or any of that either.

EDIT 1: Apparently some had a hard time reading so I'll mention it again. This was not to bash single parents as some of you felt I did even though it was mentioned twice. And for those that ask why I'll say it from a fathers perspective. As a parent, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, you cant sit there and say that the other 364 days of the year your kid(s) actually show appreciation like they do on those days. Also, I can tell by some that this struck a personal accord with you if you happened to have a man walk out on you, you have my sympathies truly. Since most I think dont fully read, this is not to take away from single parents and just FYI again....I am a father."	Asshole	0	0	559.0	35.0	0.0	0.0

c1sz5y	2019-06-17 20:54:43	farthanon	AITA for cutting my grandmother out of my life?	"This is the second time I'm trying to post this, as apparently the character limit is 3,000 (a *lot* of history here).

All my life, my grandma has shown my sisters preferential treatment. She's taken them and my mother on two trips to NYC, San Francisco, and a ton of concerts and plays, all on her dime. I've been excluded from nearly every single trip (got to go to one concert) simply because I'm ""a male and would complicate getting ready every day"". 

My grandma has also forgotten my last two birthdays. While my sisters get $200 each, I don't even get a text. I've been vocal about this sort of treatment my entire life (28 now) and I've always been told that it's just a ""girls trip"". My mom agrees that it isn't fair, but says she's not going to punish herself and my sisters by telling grandma that they're not going without me. 

Well last October I finally got to go. There was a concert an hour and a half away and they invited my wife. After arguing for a while about how unfair it is to exclude people, I got to go. I was willing to pay for my room and ticket, but grandma covered that for me. I was extremely grateful and made sure to tell her how thankful I was multiple times. 

But the big issue happened a couple months ago. My wife is a Disney fanatic (something she shares with my older sister). We found out a week before they left that the usual crew was going to a Cinderella musical (or something like that). But this time my wife wasn't included. When I asked my mother why she was left out, and if they'd even talked about it, I was told that it was discussed and ultimately, my grandma didn't want to include her because it's a ""mother-daughter trip"". I can't help but think that she was left out because grandma didn't want me to ""pitch a fit"" again and include me.

It was at this point that I decided to cut her out of my life. Like I said in the first line, there's a lifetime of instances where she treated me unfairly and left me out of things. The excuse was always ""it's a girls trip"", but now she wants to change the rules. My wife was devastated by this. Her sister passed away 5 years ago and her mother was quite honestly a terrible mother with a host of issues that lead to her being raised by her dad. She never got to go on mother-daughter trips and now my grandma wants to exclude her as well. Without my grandma's money, it's extremely likely that there will be no ""girls trip"".

I fully recognize that she's free to spend her money and she sees fit, I always have. And I've always been willing to pay my way on these trips (ever since that was a possibility, at least). But I also think I'm right to cut out someone who's brought nothing but heartache into my life as well. My mother strongly disagrees with me and says I'm being selfish."

So after several months of a tumultuous sexless relationship we decided with my (now ex) gf to break up a few days ago.

It went pretty well and we stayed mostly cordial, but for financial reasons we have to keep living together for the weeks to come. 

I got offered to join in with a couple for a threesome last night and decided to go, coming back home early this morning.

But I believe since we're not a thing anymore, I can do whatever I want it's none of her business who I have sex with. 

So, is it disrespectful? Am I the asshole?

I believe this is caused by experiences from when I was younger. Whilst heavily depressed around the age of 14 and 15 my grandparents had to move in to our house temporarily ( about 6 months). During this time, my dad and I had an awful relationship, often we would end up in shouting matches and he would punish me in some way. (I should state he was never ever abusive and I really appreciate him now.) Usually, these shouting matches would either start at or be caused by something at the dinner table. Now, both my grandparents jaws are pretty awful and cause them pain. Due to this they chew VERY loudly. I believe this negative connection with eating dinner with my family and them chewing loudly culminated in me struggling to cope with chewing sounds.

Back to today, I was sat in the car with my mum where she was chewing gum quite loudly. I considered asking her to quieten down or to stop entirely, however, we'd had a negative start to the ride so I thought she might view it as me being confrontational for the sake of it and I didn't want to upset her anymore than I had. In the end I opened the window and turned the radio up to drown the noise out a bit. (It didn't work) 

I decided against mentioning it as I didn't want to upset my mum but in the future WIBTA if I did ask my mum or other people to chew quieter? Or WIHBTA if I had asked her to chew quieter?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	6.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

So basically I moved to a new city last year and I work with 4 other friends, one of whom I had a complicated history with. We had tried to work things out initially but I'd come off an emotionally taxing relationship, we tried again but she backed out. Eventually we agreed that we should shelve this and come back to this in the middle of the year. 

Fast forward to now, and she's told me that she's going out with one of my mates from our group. Obviously I was shocked, but our discussion was amicable, I made it clear that I still had feelings and it wasn't her fault and I said that I understood that she doesn't have an obligation to feel the same for me. You can't control if you like someone and honestly if two people like each other who am I to interfere. I wished them well and made it clear that I'd be leaving this group for a while.


Now here's where the issue arises, basically I was supposed to move in with these guys and we were on the verge of selecting a place. However it must be noted that we all have our current respective tenancies running normally and it can be extended without any trouble. We have also not placed a deposit or made a payment towards the new apartment. So I figured that we would be ok staying back, turns out I was wrong. 

So my friends are unhappy that I've refused to move in, and my friend (who's now dating my mate) is saying that she doesn't want to lose a friend and that I have enough time till next month to process this information. I know myself well enough, and I know that seeing my mates together will affect me mentally. 

I understand that I'm backing out of a commitment, but no one's losing out financially and my mates live together anyway. If there were no other way I would've moved in even at the cost of my mental health, but if I know this will affect me I don't see why I should be expected to comply. 

I spoke to my best mate and my cousin, my best friend believes I should prioritize my mental well being. However my cousin outright called me a terrible friend, she said that if this is what's made me back out then I didn't really care for my friend all along. 
I've been a good friend to my whole group all this while and they say as much themselves, however they say that I'm being difficult now. I told my friend that given our history together, if she were dating an outsider I would've been ok as I could recover on my own time. But I honestly don't see how dealing with this on a daily basis would help any of us.

c1stpv	2019-06-17 20:42:21	badgrandmaproblems	WIBTA if I stopped letting my mom babysit my son?	"My husband and I have decided that we no longer feel like my mom is capable of watching our son due to some recent events, so we plan to stop letting her watch him by herself. She would still get to see our son often, but only when we are in the same room together.

We used to let her pick him up from daycare, but then one day I got a call from the fire department because my mom had been incapacitated in the grocery store bathroom due to, as she calls it, “gastric issues.” Our son (who is almost 2 years old) was with her at the time, and we were all vey lucky that he was well behaved and did not try to crawl out of the bathroom stall and run off while my mom was stuck on the toilet. It was at this time that my mom revealed that these gastric issues are a recurring, unpredictable problem. She confessed that she had been working with her doctor to try to figure out what the cause might be, and that she did not want me to worry. We decided at that time to only let her watch our son while we were very close by (like outside mowing the lawn while she was inside reading our son books) and we have been checking in on her often. She is also not to drive him anywhere. When we told her this, she was very upset and defensive, and while she did not call us “assholes” (because she doesn’t say that about anyone, really) she expressed that she felt we were overreacting and punishing her.

Since then, we have had a couple of incidents that have occurred while my husband and I were close by, but out of sight. One day, about a week ago, my mom went to pull something out of the oven while our son was standing nearby, and he touched the inside of the oven door, burning two of his fingers. My mom said that she thought he was far enough away that it would be fine, and she apologized and said she felt terrible. The burns were not bad enough to go to the doctor - just a couple of very small blisters that appeared the next day. Then yesterday while we were at a family gathering my mom offered to keep an eye on our son while my husband and I played horseshoes. After just a few minutes I heard my son crying and went to check it out. He had fallen down a couple of concrete steps and skinned his knee up pretty good - enough so that he spent the rest of the evening crying and pointing to his scrape, saying “ouch,” (which is unusual for him). At the time, my mom was sitting in a chair up on the porch, about ten feet away from our son when he fell. Again, she apologized and said she felt bad. Today he seems fine, and has been crawling around on his knees.

My husband and I agree that both incidents could have been much worse, and worry that next time it *will* be worse. We also feel confident that my mom will take a stance of “accidents happen” and will think we are assholes for restricting her time with our son even more because of a few “minor incidents.” 

So, would we be assholes if we don’t let grandma babysit anymore?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

All her life she’s managed to get people to do things for her for cheap. She has money, and has always been pretty well off, but she’s very stingy. She’s a very nice woman, but stubborn, and wants things done her way. Up until a few years ago she could move mountains, but recently she’s been slowing down a lot due to a minor heart attack and arthritis, so obviously she can’t do a lot of the things she used to could do.

Over the past couple months she’s asked me to do big stuff like build a fence, build a shed, build a gazebo, etc. along with other random time consuming tasks. I could theoretically do these things but it’s not something I’m good at or have ever done. I always ask her how much she would pay me and her answer is basically I wouldn’t be doing it for money but for her. I love her, but I don’t have the time to do something I don’t know how to do for free. And my advice is for her to get it done professionally, but she will not go through with it no matter how much she wants it done.

c1stc8	2019-06-17 20:41:29	GirlWhoCried_BadWolf	AITA For underrepresenting my niece on my picture wall?	"Relevant info: I (30F) watch my stepdaughter's daughter (so my Granddaughter) 3-4 days a week and my Niece 1 day a week. My mother-in-law has custody of Niece. I have an ok relationship with Mother-in-law but we've had some clashes in the past and I currently only ever see her when she's picking Niece up. My Stepdaughter and I are very close, her mother passed away and I've been in her life almost 10 years now, she also lives a few houses down and is at my house more days than not.

&#x200B;

Situation:

&#x200B;

We recently did some remodeling which required then repainting our living room. Since I had to take all the pictures down anyway, I decided it'd be a good time to update the pictures and add some more. Obviously, a majority of the pictures are of the people who live here, me, my husband and our 5-year-old. There is about an equal number of pictures of Stepdaughter and Granddaughter.

&#x200B;

I included one picture of my husband's side of the family, which included his mother, all his siblings and their spouses and children. For my side of the family, I had a picture of all my sisters and one of me and my mother.

&#x200B;

On Friday, Mother-in-law saw all the new pics up and took a minute to look them over. She didn't really say much and then we got Niece's stuff together and as Mother-in-law was walking out the door she stopped to ask me about a schedule change and then threw in at the last second ""I'm surprised you didn't put up more pictures of Niece."" I must have looked confused because she went on, ""She might think you're leaving her out since you have so many pictures of Granddaughter but none of Niece and you watch them both."" I pointed out that Niece was in the pic of Husband's family and she said something along the lines of ""I have some nicer looking pics of Niece that I'll send you.""

&#x200B;

Husband is very close with his mom and she apparently called him. This part is based on what my husband told me, and he's terrible at relaying convos. She told him that she was disappointed/surprised (he used both) that I had a pic of just my mom and me since we aren't that close, but not a picture of her with Husband. She also reiterated that there should be more pictures of Niece. Today she sent me some ok snapshots of Niece with no other message.

&#x200B;

I worked really hard putting all these pics together and I really don't want to change it. I want to just ignore the whole thing but I know she'll be here again and will notice they haven't changed. I did tell her that I'm putting single pics up in my daughter's room, with all her aunts, uncles and cousins.

&#x200B;

So am I the asshole for not making my Niece as prominent on my picture wall as Granddaughter since they're both here regularly? WIBTA to refuse to change them? WIBTA if I don't find/take a picture of Husband and Mother-in-law? I don't want to be hurting a 3 1/2-year-old's feelings, I'm less worried about Mother-in-law but will totally change them if I'm the asshole here."	Not the A-hole	0	0	499.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

c1sswo	2019-06-17 20:40:30	MrNosh	WIBTA if I asked my family members to help me avoid another family member?	" 

Growing up my mother’s side of the family was all really close. At one point we all lived across the street from one another and constantly had big family meals and get togethers.  My cousins were more like siblings and me, being the oldest grandchild, was often seen as the “big brother” and role model—especially for young cousin “Jane” we’ll call her.

Handful of years ago I went through a really bad breakup and moved back to my hometown.  Jane offered me the spare room at her apartment because 1) she knew I needed a place to stay and 2) needed help with rent and bills because her boyfriend “John” kept spending all of his money on pot and pills.  Eventually his drug using caused them to break up, and my cousin suggested her and I get a new place.  I said sure because I knew she couldn’t live alone with the income she was making and she was family.  The day we go to move however, she tells me that John is staying with us because his place fell through and he had nowhere to go.  She didn’t ask me about it or get my okay for it.  She just declared that it was happening and that was that.

Less than a week after we move in and she leaves on a Summer trip—one she takes every year—to the family cabin a province over.  While she’s gone John—who agreed to a strict no pills or hard drugs policy while he stayed with us—started inviting people over and all they did was hard drugs.  Coke.  Pills.  You name it.  I told Jane that I was about to kick him out, but she convinced me not to and that she’d talk him.  It didn’t work.  So I called a buddy of mine on the police force to come have them removed.  Couple days later and he shows up with his brother and they both threaten to kick my ass and, his brother—who’s got some serious issues—threatened to straight up kill me.  I left the apartment and stayed with a friend.  I told my cousin that it was either him or me…she chose him—they now have a child together and he’s still snorting shit all the time.

I ended up moving out of the city and haven’t talked to her sense, though her sister says she still asks about me.  I’m going to be visiting my hometown again in a couple months to be the photographer at a friend’s wedding and want to introduce my new girlfriend to some of my family, but I don’t want Jane to know I’m going to be in town nor do I want to see her.

"First off, my brother just recently started to see a woman with 2 teenaged daughters (15, 13), and she allows them to smoke and drink.  I don't judge, as long as they aren't doing it in front of my nephews I'm not their parent.

However this weekend my brother has his 3 sons (8, 11, 13) at his girlfriends grilling out, adults having a couple drinks. Girlfriends 15 year old had 2 Male friends over at the get together. I noticed that one of the teenagers was smoking a cigarette, and pretending like he was going to burn my 11 year old nephew. I told his dad, and he said if the nephew was bothered by it he would have said something. But I mean to me the adult that made me feel uncomfortable.

Fast forward a few hours, I go inside and one of the teenaged friends is sitting on the couch with my 13 year old nephew smoking a vape pen, and I became enraged, yelled at the kid that he better not have gave any of that to my nephew and that he needs to put that shit away around the kids I know because they are not going to end up like how I did, an addict felon, on my watch.

Brothers girlfriend said I had no right to talk to her guests that way and kicked me out. My brother hasn't talked to me since either. I mean I feel like I was probably an asshile telling at a kid, but I feel like I was somewhat justified, and just want some non bias opinions."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I met this girl, let's call her Kit, via a sports club. I started talking to her via Instagram (sorry, I'm a normie, I'm trying to cut it down), then moving on to Snapchat and finally getting her number.

We went on two dates. Where on Whatsapp and Snapstagram she was really nice to talk to, the two dates were awfully awkward. We barely talked and she didn't look as happy as I figured she would, considering how nice our contact on social media was.

Anyway, I decided to just cut out contact with her because, obviously, she wasn't interested in me. Simple.

But not very long ago she asked me how I was and she starts getting all warm again.

c1sqj6	2019-06-17 20:35:12	TodakaYasumi	AITA for yelling at my dad to shut up while being in a panic attack?	" I'm a 16 yrs old South-East Asian, had symptoms of BPD but not confirmed because therapy services here sucks and prejudice on mental issues in SEA,had panic attacks and breakdowns recently. 

Night, I was checking over my plans for the week. I'm building a habit of keeping my to-dos and plans in place so I don't freak out,but my mom arranged for a belated Children's Day meetup without notifying me in advance, which time overlapped a skill workshop I'm attending, so as a result, the little change threw me into a panic attack, I started to breathe heavily and asked if I can not attend. She said no and I was on the verge of crying so I took the plastic plant on my table and started cleaning it to calm myself down.

My dad however, urged me to get to bed early so I went to bed, still heavily breathing. My dad heard my breathing and he growled ""The fuck did I do to you that you are crying?"" and started cursing. Lights were all off so he didn't notice that I'm in a panic, but the last time I was in a panic attack before him, he acted the same - cursed me and called me a whore. My mom knew I was in a panic so she tried advising my dad to stop cursing and hear me out why I was in a panic. 
But instead my dad didn't stop the cursing and started to curse even worse, telling me I'm a liar since birth and I'm only throwing tantrums to back up my pathetic arse, acting the victim to impose him stressing me out all the time. Both started quarelling and I yelled ""Dad please shut the fuck up and let me listen only to mom!"". Dad still insisted on my fault for being an a-hole to him while I was curled up and shivering, crying and couldn't breathe in my own bed. 

Note that I only trust mom with telling my fears. My dad was someone who barely existed in my memory of my first 8 years of life since he only visited me in the weekends but for an evening then left, he could have changed work places earlier, but instead he was living under the same roof with his younger sister's family, and spent time taking care of my cousin in place of her dad working overseas, my grandma revealed. 
He is no listener but command things in house, get my mom shouldering his car debt, his debt with my mom's youngest sister and now he had recently made another debt for mom by lending money to another cousin of his, while we are struggling to make ends meet for my classes' fees along with my little brother's. Past action, but the first thing I remember of him when I was 8 years old was him beating me up for breaking a plate, and he gave me beating whenever I make a mistake until I was 12. Beatings is an commom form of education and parenting in the South-East Asia.

c1sqbx	2019-06-17 20:34:47		AITA for being angry my SO gave me a gift for my birthday?	"So my birthday was just yesterday and I’m sort of feeling bad about how everything played out... TLDR on bottom since I’m long-winded. 

Basically, me and my long-time girlfriend came to an agreement somewhat recently (before Christmas) that we would not be giving each other gifts for holidays/birthdays. 

We can go on outings, have a nice dinner, see a show or something, but both of us realized finding material gifts is very stressful and we don’t want either being disappointed or have to return it. 

Especially since I have a habit of giving extravagant gifts and my girlfriend feels like she can’t reciprocate. I totally understood and it was a mutual agreement.

Anyways, on to the situation at hand. 

Me and my girlfriends birthday are only a couple weeks apart. We had a celebration with friends a couple weeks ago, they gave her some gifts, I made dinner. It was nice, we had a great time.

Yesterday, we did something similar for my birthday. She made dinner this time, same sort of deal with all our friends around (we met in college and have the same friend group). A couple of close friends gave me a bottle of wine and a coaster set.

Then my girlfriend announces she has a special gift for me. I felt kind of nervous and said something along the lines of an awkward, “like a special dessert?” 

She laughs and says no and then brings out this box. For half a second I felt like she was gonna propose or something, and almost freaked out, but I noticed the box was a little large for that. 

She had me open it in front of everyone and it was a diamond studded bracelet. It looked very expensive. All my friends seemed impressed. I liked it but suddenly felt very embarrassed because I got her nothing for her birthday.

I didn’t make any sort of scene there. Just said thank you and then the party ended soon after. I was pretty angry, probably unjustly for a gift, but I felt very very uncomfortable about this. 

Later when we went to bed she noticed I was quiet and asked me what was wrong. 

And I told her that I was very upset and angry that she got me such a nice gift when we both agreed to get nothing. And I said that I felt like a jerk in front of our friends who knew I got nothing for her.

She said I was overreacting and said that she was just making up for all the nice gifts I’d given her in the past. I told her I didn’t feel right about this and wanted to get her something for her birthday two weeks ago.

Then she got angry saying that I have to “out-shine” her which was not my intention. It was a very cold bed that night. 

Now she’s at work and I’m not sure how to fix the situation... I know I made her feel bad but I still feel like I have a point. So reddit, am I the asshole? 

TLDR me and girlfriend have agreement to give no gifts. she gave me very nice gift in front of all our friends, who knew I got her nothing for her birthday a couple weeks ago. Felt angry. Told her. Now we’re both cold shouldering .... and I’m feeling bad"	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

NOT HUSBAND!!!) I've known this guy since I was 5 and at the start he was generally nice but now he's become a bitch. He always tries to get on my nerve, always tries to control me, always is going off at me for things that don't even concern him. By this point I hate him, he has lost any permission to tell me what to do and even come in my room, even though he still \*EVERY DAMN EVENING\* comes into my room to say Hi after getting home from his 5h of work (wow provides so much for us, 5h a day. Meanwhile my mum works 12h everyday of the week while he gets Sundays off) and he doesn't even knock. On the 15th I went home to Lithuania, and he's been tryna get in touch with me to ask me how I've been since the second I got internet. Whenever we EVER talk its ""How are you, what did you do, miss home? When are you coming back? What did you do?"" small talk (which I hate) and always repeating himself, always wasting time which I could be seeing family and always \*ANNOYING ME\*

So Ive been ignoring him calls and the last time I messaged him was on 16.06 at 13:15 saying Im busy, evne though I was eating ice cream at the time.

Am I the asshole for ignoring someone who pisses the literal hell out of me?

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are saying I'm being a typical teenager and while yes I am still a teenager and I do tend to hate everything, I have never had this problem with anyone. I have never had such hatred for someone as much as I do for him.

He is the type of person (agreed throughout my whole family) that goes out of his way to make things worse for everyone and best as he possibly can, literally \*YELLED\* at me for leaving lights on in my room when I rushed in the car to take my dog who was in extreme pain to vet. My mum literally said ""What in the hell is wrong with you? She was in such a panic and the fact that Popi looked like she was dying cancels out forgetting to turn off the light."" I'm also not comfortable sharing much about this but he has insulted my biological father in front of everyone after getting drunk, insulted my sisters biological father (We have different fathers) and has also accused my mum of cheating for having a guy friend.

Now that you know more context, I hope people might change their minds but if you all still thing im an asshole I completely accept that and might eventually consider talking to him... maybe.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: My mother is completely aware of my strong hatred to him and she is the person I vent to about him.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: Holy crap lots of edits- I am not a spoiled teenager. Firstly due to our financial situation theres no time for me to be spoiled, and I actually enjoy giving rather than getting. Please don't think Im this girl that doesn't want some random guy being with my mother. I want my mother to be happy, I want my other to have a partner but I either want him to change or I want to change him with someone else. My mother isn't happy with him, but she loves him.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: He's not checking on me, if my mother needed to check no me she'd call me, shes aware of my hatred for him and wouldn't send him to me to annoy me more. Also have I mentioned he doesn't knock? And we are aware I do need to change clothes."	Asshole	0	0	5.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

"Background: This concerns my Best Friend (BF) of 20 years. We are like brothers but he moved to a different state 5 years ago to be closer to his wife’s family. He has been married to his Wife (W) for 9 years and they have a 6 year old child. I am godfather to the child and love her very much. BF is a very wonderful man, he’s a gentle giant (6’4” - think a more talkative Hodor) and has always been a beta wolf who just kind of goes with the flow. His Wife is a small woman (5 feet) quite attractive. W is, in my opinion, kind of a horrible person. She has a masters degree in her field but hasn’t worked in 8 years because she has “anxiety” and BF makes a decent living at a software guy for a large shipping company, enough for them to have a comfortable middle class life. W is a stay at home mom (her choice) but she doesn’t really take care of the house, doesn’t cook, doesn’t clean, and makes BF feel guilty about doing anything for himself. Example: he has to pretend to be working overtime just to see a movie by himself after work a couple times a year. Every minute of his time has to be accounted for.

Getting to the point: About 6 months ago W cheated on my BF. W did not come clean but BF discovered iMessages synced to her iPad where she was saying romantic things to some guy she knew in high school. She was lying and staying out until 3 or 4 am saying she was out with her college-age sister, but the sister wasn’t informed of the lie and so told BF the truth when he asked about W’s whereabouts. W tried to lie to BF about it but she eventually confessed, but said nothing sexual beyond kissing ever happened (I don’t believe this.) She told BF that she didn’t love him anymore. And at one point hit him with the iPad as he was reading texts she had sent to the other guy. She then suggested that even though she hit him if she called the police HE would be the one going to jail. Things went to shit and BF and his W were preparing for a separation/divorce and were in mediation when W realized that due to her state’s new laws, she was only gonna get 3 years of spousal support and ZERO child support because BF was demanding joint custody. At this point W totally changed her tune and wanted to reconcile. Because my BF is a pushover and he wants believe she didn’t fuck this other guy, he took her back. For the past 6 months they basically have just been living on auto-pilot. I’ve heard my god-daughter can tell that things are not right, that mommy and daddy are cold to each other. W still nags him about everything and generally treats him like crap...and as time passes her “guilt” from the infidelity dissipates with every week. In a phone convo with BF I recently told him that his W is dogshit and that he’ll continue to be miserable as long as he keeps her around. He didn’t expect me to be so blunt and things have been a bit strained since but on some level I think he knows I’m right. I’m very close with his family (they still live in my state) and they pretty much believe what I do. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	787.0	64.0	0.0	0.0
c1snq5	2019-06-17 20:29:10		WIBTA if I told a friend to stop using Congolese war orphans as props?	"Longtime asshole connoisseur, first time poster.

So I have this friend, let's call her Jessica. I don't want to get into too much detail about who she is or what she does, but we are not close. We are Facebook friends and talk a lot about animals since we're both kinda crazy about them. We only hang out when we are hanging out with other friends. We're both of Middle Eastern background.

So recently, Jessica moved to DR Congo, Kinshasa. She's there to work with Congolese war orphans through an NGO. I don't know how long she'll be there or what specifically she's doing with them, but I'm starting to really get annoyed by the way she's posting pictures of these kids on Facebook.

Look: I'm all for going to help orphans in the Congo. But her stream is basically nothing but pictures of her, surrounded by Congolese kids, saying things like, ""OMG! Look at them! They are so miserable!"" or, ""They are effectively starving and dying on these streets."" Or, ""OMG! The neglect is too much. I can't hold back tears talking to these orphans."" Or, ""They are starved for affection. Just wanting to touch and hug and get love."" This is btw the exact kind of language that she uses when talking about abandoned pets. (Some of you who work with animals can probably attest to this use of such language).

Not a single kid is named, btw. Ever. They're just there to stand all around her while she talks about how HORRIFIC their suffering is. There is no context. She isn't asking for funds. She isn't asking anyone to come join her or her NGO in helping these kids. They're just there while she speaks of their ""unspeakable"" suffering. It's really making my skin crawl. I feel like if you want to go work with disadvantaged children, by all means, go ahead and do it. I admire and appreciate people who do that. But it is disrespectful as hell to post pictures of them constantly, not using names or telling stories that have a point, talking about their progress or background or life story or anything else for that matter. Just, ""Hey, look! Black kids. Starving and dying. SO SAD! Also, I'm here holding back tears because this is so hard!"" I feel like what she's doing is the wrong approach. She should tell their stories, mention their names, give background, what are they doing with their lives, what are their goals and dreams etc. Not this, ""OMG! STARVING CONGOLESE ORPHAN! I'M HUGGING HIM OMG!""

So, reddit. WIBTA if I confronted her gently and very nicely explained to her that what she's doing is disrespectful?

c1slaa	2019-06-17 20:23:40		AITA for telling my boyfriend he needs to step up?	"So, my boyfriend (m24), who we'll call John, got a whippet puppy 6 months ago (who's now 8 months). For context, I (f19) have a 2yo whippet x border collie from a puppy. Let's call me Jane (original, I know). Also, we live together. 

Now, his puppy has separation anxiety and a small group of behavioural issues that I firmly believe my boyfriend has caused through laziness and ignorance etc. His puppy has started affecting my dogs behavior. He has never barked at other dogs but since the puppy barked constantly at anything that moves, my dog has started and it makes me angry because it affects my dog, he also has started growling since he thinks the puppy is scared. Again he never growled until the puppy came along. Basically, I walked my dog and his and the dogs went racing towards someone who was terrified of animals. My dog brushed her then came running back, the puppy launched at her and made her have a panic attack and her partner started shouting at me. The puppy also started loudly barking at another dog (a rescue it turns out) who got so scared it wet itself. When I got home I shouted at my partner because he thinks the puppy is perfect for what he wants and won't put in any time to train it, only feeding and barely walking it. I know he struggles with depression but I think he should step up. I've been where he is but I still did the bare minimum for my dog and he isn't even doing that.

I don't want to compare the puppy to my dog but he was 100x better at that age, but I can't get John to put the effort in. I'm at the stage where I have to do nearly everything for the dog and having to start retraining mine because his behaviour is effected. I don't want to be selfish but I'm beginning to wonder if his dog should be rehomed since I feel I do nearly everything for it.

Tldr: boyfriends dog is badly behaved due to lack of training, walked it, it was awful and I yelled at depressed boyfriend."	Not enough info	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1sksc	2019-06-17 20:22:31		AITA for ruining fathers day?	"So to give you some background I live in the same town as my parents. My relationship with my mom is very strained but I get along with my dad great. My mom gets upset if I don't come over at least once a week to check in even though all we do when I go over there is sit and watch TV and barely talk. They also never make an effort to come to my house even though I have invited them multiple times. 

Anyway the plan was to go over for Fathers day and just eat dinner with the family. (My older sister also lives with my parents). My dad doesn't seem to care too much about holidays and didn't know it was fathers day until we told him Saturday.

My roommate is from the East coast and doesn't have family anywhere close so I thought it might be nice to invite him. I called my mom to see if that was alright and she got weird about. I said it was fine if she said no and didn't want to cook more or wanted it to be just family. She said ""yeah I'm really not okay with that"" in a super weird tone so I said okay that's fine and got off the phone. I text my sister to ask why mom was being so weird and she said ""Your roomate is annoying and no one likes him""....

My parents have both only meant him once for about five minutes each so I was a little confused and highly irritated. I knew if I went over and stayed for dinner it was going to turn into a huge screaming match. I brought my dad the card I got him and asked him if he would be upset if I didnt stay for dinner. He said that was totally fine he understands. I go to tell my mom that I'm not going to stay for dinner because I don't feel good. She starts to try to talk to me about the whole roomate thing and says she doesn't personally care but she knew my sister and dad didn't like him so she didn't want him over. Knowing my dad I seriously doubt he had an opinion on the matter unless maybe he didn't feel like socializing. At this point my sister chimes in and is talking about how annoying she thinks my roomate is. I tell her I don't really care what she thinks because she hates everyone. (She has maybe one friend other than me and literally hates everyone). 

At some point of me trying to leave whilst arguing with my sister my mom said bye and that she loved me. I did not hear her so I didnt say it back. She texts me after I leave that the fact that I didnt say I love you back to her is really fucked up. I text her back and say I didnt hear her because I was busy arguing with my sister. She never texted back. 

I have no idea what happen after i left but based off passed experiences my mom probably got super pissed and started screaming and never cooked dinner. I hope they sat down and had a nice dinner without me but i seriously doubt it. I feel really guilty because my dad got caught in the middle of all this and he had to stay and probably listen to my mother and sister argue all evening.

I (27M) have been dating this girl (20F) for a couple of months. We met last year in July in a class and became friends. We hung out every day after class and we would just chill at her apartment and talk all night. Conversations with her are just effortless and I have no doubt in mind that she cares about me. She's so sweet, kind, funny and she's absolutely gorgeous. 
I feel at home with her. 

We finally started dating in January and things have been going great. I see her about once or twice a week, 3 if we're lucky and we text all the time. We haven't had any fights and any possible conflicts were resolved quickly with great communication. 

We watch so many tv shows and movies together. We just sit on her couch in her apartment and watch a shit ton of stuff on tv. 

I've struggled with a depression for a long chunk of my life but around her I've begun to feel a little better. She constantly reminds me to love myself. My world is just better with her in it.

But this past Friday, I celebrated my brother's 22nd birthday and for some reason it hit me. My little brother is younger than my own girlfriend. All of a sudden all these thoughts kept pouring into my head.

I suddenly feel like I'm holding her back from enjoying and experiencing her youth. I want her to date other people her own age. I also now feel like the creepy older guy. It's really hard to explain but it's just that now it feels inappropriate and I don't know if I can continue the relationship in good conciousness.

When I was 22 I dated a woman who was 30 and she broke up with me for the same reasons. When I was younger I didn't get it but now I do. 

I know that I should've taken the age difference into consideration when we first started dating. But I was in a bad place and she's just so amazing and I thought I was okay with it. But now I realize that I'm not. 

I really adore my girlfriend, shoot I might even be in love with her. But I just don't know if I could continue the relationship.

About a month ago my godmother asks me what day I graduate from college. I tell her, and two weeks later I get an email saying she booked a tour/trip to Italy for us next year (2020) from July 8th-August 6th. She did not ask if I wanted to go do this and also expects me to pay for my flight and trip insurance. It’s not so much that I don’t want to go; it’s that I don’t want to spend a whole month of my last summer with her (65 y/o) while my friends and parents do other fun things. I also don’t know what I’ll be doing yet after college so I think it’s a big commitment to make because what if I get a job that starts in July?! Then, she drops another bomb saying we’re spreading her husbands ashes over there so now I feel even more guilty. Pretty sure she’s paid off like half of the trip already but it’s not for another year...so am I the asshole if I back out of the trip now or am I just ungrateful?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The next morning I woke up to her crying, she said she was in a serious relationship and our hookup was a big mistake. I instinctively apologized, but she insisted it was all her fault, and I had no reason to apologize. I gave her my word that I will keep quiet about things, and this would just be our secret.

I've kept my word for years. I never said nothing to anyone, I've actually almost forgot about it myself. 

About a month ago, I was scrolling through Facebook when I seen something that shook my whole world up. I seen a picture of my daughter sitting on some random guy's lap. After a doubletake and a thorough inspection, I realized this was not my daughter. I realized that it was my old friend's husband and their daughter.

The resemblance is uncanny those girls are almost twins. The math adds up and, my thoughts have been driving me crazy for a month now. I want to say something, I feel like I need to know the truth. I need to put my mind to rest. I don't want to break a family, but after my mom passed away, I found out that me and my children are at high risk for colon cancer. If she is my child, I feel like this is something she needs to know.

EDIT: If I found out she was mine, I would most definitely want to be a part of her life. What kind of man would I be if I didn't? I agreed to keep her infidelity a secret, I never agreed to let another man raise my child. 

I feel guilty, because the two of them look so happy in that picture. I would hate to spoil the relationship between those two. I couldn't imagine if I found out my daughter wasn't mine.  But at the same time I can't imagine missing out on my child's life."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

&#x200B;

I'll try to keep this short.

&#x200B;

About 5 months ago, I \[16M\] got a crush on this girl \[17F\]. Let's call her G. I knew that I couldn't just ask to be her boyfriend, so I decided to try to be her friend first before moving into dating mode. (We knew each other before this BTW.) Basically, I followed her around for 5 months and hung out with her before school and during lunch. I tried to get her to come over to my place so we could watch a movie together (with other friends) or whatever. She always said she was busy. Looking back, she probably was trying to avoid me by saying she was busy, but I didn't take the hint.

&#x200B;

About a month later, I was talking with G, and asking if she could come to my place to watch Star Wars. She then proceeded to tell me that she had a date with her boyfriend. I was crushed, but she never mentioned it to me before. I was a bit suspicious, so I asked one of her other friends if G had a boyfriend. G's friend said she didn't. I then thought G didn't want to be friends with me, so I then avoided her for a week, because the way I saw it, she wanted to be left alone. After that, G texted me, asking what was going on. I told her that I thought she didn't want to be friends with me because she was always saying that she was busy, and she got really mad at me. She said that she was always really busy with studying for the SATs, and with track and field. I told her that I was really sorry for doing this, and asked her what I could do to fix this. She then told me to have a good night, and that I'd see her tomorrow.

&#x200B;

She hasn't talked to me since. I really want to date her, or be friends with her, even.

c1sdky	2019-06-17 20:06:13	PoopyPantiesRound1	WIBTA If I make my husband tell his employees they are not welcome to stay at our house?	"A little back story first.  My SO is an owner of a construction company and employs several dozen contractors in about 5 cities around the state.  From time to time he needs help in our city and on those ""one off"" situations where employees of his are driving in from out of town (approximately 1-2 hours away) he offers our place for them to stay since we have an extra bedroom.  I will also say that 9 times out of 10 these employees are friends of his.  There's a few times where it has been a surprise where he just walks in with one of the guys which leaves me running around the kitchen trying to figure out how to adjust dinner to accommodate and extra mouth to feed.  Last week he had to go out and buy his worker dinner because I just didn't have enough.

&#x200B;

Now, I am more than happy to give them room and board for a few days on those one off's.  I get it, business is tough and whats good for the goose is good for the gander.  When business has been rough before there was a time when we had a different worker living at our house free of charge for up to two months.  This went on for about two years.  I felt like I was being taken advantage of.  After I had about enough of that we compromised with a one week maximum.  Now, I will say that after I put my foot down my SO agreed, apologized and then the workers got hotels, stayed at friends' houses, etc...  

&#x200B;

Now to the situation we have currently: Last Monday family came into town to stay for a couple of days.  I heard that my SO's worker, Michael, was in town as well staying at another coworkers' house.  I'm just glad it's not mine at this point.  Wednesday I received a text from my SO as I am driving home from work stating ""Just FYI, Michael is at our house right now.""  I had no problems with that, workers come over all the time to pickup parts.  Nope, it turns out that Michael was staying with us Wednesday night and Thursday night.  My first thought was, ""Why in the hell now that family left does he need to stay with us?""  Apparently he had been sleeping on the other coworkers' couch and it just wasn't ""ideal"" for him.  I was irritated but the week went okay he was one of his friends so it wasn't too terrible of a time.    

&#x200B;

Now let's fast forward to today, the power is out in my office building so they sent us all home for the day.  I pull up to my house and see Michael's car in the driveway and I am fuming.  I want to take back the compromise, I am just DONE with this.  I'm done feeding these guys for free, I'm done cleaning their dishes, I'm done letting them stay at my house for free, I am just done.  My SO is being highly inconsiderate about letting me know in advance when his workers are coming up here to stay with us and I've just had enough.  They all need to grow up and pay for a hotel room for the night.  I am just over this whole situation.

c1sa6f	2019-06-17 19:58:43	safdaces	AITA for asking my roommate to cover the full deposit for her and her boyfriend’s cat?	"Just to clarify, I am 18F and she is 20F. We’ve lived together before and are moving for the sake of location (price is higher than where we are at currently). 

We’re looking at a place that’s around 800 a month. It’s a low-income and the reason I’ve been very keen on the place we’re supposed to be moving into is because it is two blocks away from my school and a 5-10 minute car ride to her work vs the 30 minute commute we both make right now. It is a beautiful place and we are very excited. 

To clarify, neither of our partners are going to live in the apartment. It is just the two of us and we’ve established that should either of our boyfriends move in, we’re split utilities given however many people are living there (right now 2, but if the SO’s move in either 3 or 4 ways) but keep rent 400 and 200/200 for those sharing a room.

I’ve been getting down to the splitting of costs with her over text. The place we’re moving into allows pets with $200 deposit and $20 added to rent a month. I don’t have any pets right now, and she is looking into adopting a cat with her boyfriend, who will not be moving in as of right now. I’ve told her that if she is bringing the cat in, her boyfriend and her should split the deposit and I’m willing to help cover the $20 monthly and include it in the cost of rent.

She seemed a little offput and just responded with “me and [SO] will talk about it”

Obviously I will be around the cat, but I don’t think I should pay the deposit as it’s not my cat. There are two animals allowed in the apartment and should I look into adopting an animal, I’d offer to pay the full deposit for the animal.

"Saw the post about the woman informing the restaurant about an apparent underage customer drinking a margarita and it reminded me of something I did a few years ago. Wondering retrospectively if I was TA.

I was in town in the morning running some errands, near a main school I know pretty well. I have worked at a good proportion of the schools in my area as an enrichment/outreach teacher, and while I never taught at this school in particular, a lot of people in my professional circle have done, and some of my friends and family members went there when they were kids. 

While I was waiting outside a pharmacy for it to open, lots of the school kids are passing me on the main road (it's right before the first bell.) While I'm stood there, I see a young boy in the school uniform, with two girls, openly take out a pack of cigarettes, light one and begin smoking. I say ""young"", I mean he was year 7 or 8 (between 11 and 13.) At some point he sees me watching him and tells me very casually and politely that the pharmacy won't open for another 15 minutes. I tell him I know and I'm fine waiting and keep watching him and his friends as he walks down the road (which is a main, busy road), smoking the entire time. I decide then to take out my phone and call the school to tell them I had seen one of their young students smoking. I do that, and give a brief description of the kid to the receptionist.

I can't say exactly what it was that bothered me so much. Maybe it was because I knew the school pretty well, and work with kids, or because he looked so young and was so flagrantly open about smoking right before first bell, on the main street, right down the road from the school, but I remember feeling a bit ""am I really going to be this person?"" when I made the call, and seeing the post today from the restaurant made me think of it again.

c1s8ww	2019-06-17 19:56:01		AITA for telling off a person about a mutual friend when he/she approached me about what to do about this mutual friend	"So a couple of hours ago I got a few messages from a friend, let’s call her Y, that is concerned about a mutual friend let’s call him/her X. We are basically the people closest to X besides his/her SO. 
X has been having some mental issues for a long time now and every now and then there are a lot of bad days. On these days X is very negative and I would even say aggressive. Y had pretty much been getting shat on on a daily basis by X the past few weeks. All verbal stuff, no name calling and such but shiiish X sounds aggressive when X throws a tantrum. 
Now Y is definitely in the right to dislike that or have something to say about that.
So Y messaged me asking to talk about it and if I could not mention this to X, sure np (both not on reddit btw). She then proceeds to label what is wrong with X and all the mental diseases she finds applicable. Let me add Y is knowledgeable about this stuff. Eventually Y arrives at wanting to escalate the situation and where I respectfully disagreed with Y before, saying i think it’s a behavior thing and the fix would be hard work, lots of thinking and us providing her with situations to “practice” in, doing fun stuff and not doing it ax’s way. I now told her off about it. Told her she is trying to wash her hands for the obvious recent fight they had and that she only came to me because X wins these standoffs. Proceeded to discourage her from trying to help X since this is how she thought about  doing it and that if one wants to escalate against X, I’m the last person one should talk to. 
The thing is, she’s right, X sucks sometimes and definitely has some mental issues, but I don’t really care about how that affects Y. I treat X like spouse and would choose his/her side pretty much regardless. Being a massive A, isn’t enough. It kinda feels like Y is trying to get back at X for the tantrums to me. Y was hurt by my mistrust in her intentions.

TL;DR friend X with mental issues is a massive A sometimes, friend Y wants to escalate. I told her she shouldn’t in a barely friendly fashion and she is hurt by my mistrust.

I have a best friend we'll call Collin. Collin and I are both members of the LGBT community.

Collin is comfortable using and hearing slurs directed at LGBT people (f*ggot, dyke, tranny, queer) while I don't like being called any of these things. However, I am only really bothered by his use of the F slur, f*ggot. I don't like hearing this word because I don't like being reminded of the times I've been unironically called this and it's a slur and I don't like it and I don't want to be called by it. I don't really need a special reason to be honest. Collin very frequently uses this word.

The thing is, I am told by other people that the F slur is only directed at and used against gay men and so it shouldn't effect me to hear it. I'm not a gay male, I am a straight transgender male. I'm told that since I'm straight the word shouldn't effect me.

Also, free speech, I get it. But I'm wondering if it would be assholish to ask that he refrain from using the word around me. I feel it's not all too much to ask, even though he's gotten way too comfortable with it as I've let it slide for a long time. And by the way, he's not a gay male, he's bisexual. Probably doesn't make any difference but since everyone tells me it's specific to gay men I thought it would be relevant.

My wife (who isn’t catholic herself anymore) comes from an ultra-religious large catholic family. I’m currently on vacation with them and, in a word, it’s been miserable. 

We don’t really do anything. To give you an example, yesterday we drove an hour one way to go to a 1.5 hour long Latin mass and then spent the rest of the day grocery shopping and not doing much of anything. 

Even when we went to an amusement park, we rode two rides and spent the rest of the time standing around in the sun.

In the evenings, there is a mandatory rosary for everyone. 

The worst of all is her mother who really doesn’t care what the group wants to do and just bosses everyone around. 

This is supposed to turn into an annual vacation thing. Reddit, I can’t. 

I told my wife, “I don’t care if you divorce me, I’m not doing this again.” 

She got really mad. And said that her parents paid a lot of money for this vacation to make it nice and that I was one of the most selfish people she knows. 

So, am I the asshole?


Edit: I accept my judgement. I apologized to my wife for my comment. It came from the frustration of the moment but that’s not an excuse. 

We ended up having a great talk about it.

My wife shared with me that she also isn’t having a very good time but she’s also really disappointed since she was hoping this vacation to go differently.

I live in a city about 20 minutes away, so I went to visit her a few weeks ago and I was supposed to meet her boyfriend of 6 months. I was meant to stay the night at her place.

When I arrived, we went to the frozen yogurt place where we planned to meet up with her boyfriend. She got a text and he said he was running late, then asked if it was okay if he was bringing friends along. She got all excited and I felt uncomfortable. She’s talked about this group before and from the description, they’re rowdy, loud and while that’s fun for some, I’m an introvert (which she knows). She said “I’m telling (insert BF’s name) to bring them” then as she was typing it out, I think she saw that I felt uncomfortable and asked if that was okay with me.  It seemed like a done deal either way, so I said “It seems already sorted out.”

A half hour later (and friend wouldn’t let us get our frozen yogurt without them), they finally all show up. As expected, they’re loud, rowdy and kind of obnoxious. I think the lady working can see I’m uncomfortable because when I go to pay for mine, she asks if I’m okay and I explained the situation. She said that was pretty crappy of my friend to do and I silently agreed (friend wasn’t nearby). No one really talked to me there, my friend tried to integrate me but it was awkward.

Afterwards, they invited all of us to one guy’s house for video games. Friend said yes and since she was my ride (I had take transport to her city), I had no choice. Off we went. They all played video games (not enough controllers for everyone), friend and boyfriend were being all lovey dovey. I sat with the guy’s cat for over an hour, feeling weird.

Finally, we went to my friend’s house. Her boyfriend had followed and my friend gave me a look when I didn’t realize they wanted alone time to say goodnight. I quickly ran inside and got ready for bed. I went home the next day, her oblivious. A few weeks later she asked me to come hang out with them again, I declined and requested that the next time we hang out, it be just us. She asked why and I explained how uncomfortable I was the first time. She said that I shouldn’t have expected it to be just us and the boyfriend, even though those were the plans we made. I tried to explain that big crowds like that make me anxious, but she said that I just wanted her to myself and ended the call.

my family started being quite an asshole towards
me a couple months ago. It started of with a
bunch of small things like making me the butt
of his jokes and things like that, and I just forgot
about it. Then he started making me feel bad for
him not being invited to things even tho we did
everything together so I didn't think to ask, Id
ask our friends who are normally busy. He then
took to asking me out then going out with other
people instead.

But this is what really hurt our friendship, we
both plan on starting a small business together
within carpentry and instead of seeing me as a
friend I felt like a competitor, so that got taken
from under me, for him to follow up by tell our
friends that ""he has so much shit on us"" that hurt
the most. My trust for him at that point was gone.
I then find out he's slept with one of my
best friends, someone who was expecting a
relationship to form, just for him to kick her to the
kerb.

He tried turning friends against me, in minor
ways but ruining their trust with me nonetheless.
Anyway I've spoken to him about all of this and
he apologised told me it would stop, it has. He
kept trying to apologise more and I told him
that's its done and sorted, I'm not going to hold it
against him anymore but I just can't move passed
it, I can't trust him and I feel like I'm going back on my word. 

This is probably a mess to read, I apologise
there's things missing from this that he did but
it's already long enough, AITA for saying I forgive
him when in reality I don't know If I can?

TLDR: Best friend started being a dick to me and
betrayed trust; I confronted him, he apologised
and I said I forgive him even though I don't."	Asshole	0	0	232.0	27.0	0.0	0.0

"The subdivision my parents live in is mostly older retirees, but the rental home next door recently had a family with a bunch of kids move in. The kids have been a massive pain in the ass. Our backyard security camera caught them climbing over the privacy fence, jumping on the roof, and going into the yard to get a ball, instead of just knocking on the door and asking my parents for it. We've found BBs that popped holes in the inflatable pool and landed in our dog's water bowl. They were shooting at each other with paintball guns and popped one of our trucks, leaving a few dents in the door. My parents tried talking to the parents and mentioned going to the police with the camera footage if it kept happening, but all that did was stop the kids from doing anything in the camera's field of view.

When my dad was in the hospital, I spent a few days watching the house and taking care of the dog. I pulled up and saw a green trike sitting in the lawn. I got a closer look; it was one of the sturdy, metal frame ones with big bike tires meant for older kids, one that I'd seen the kids next door riding whenever I stopped by to hang out with my family. 

The entire yard is fenced in, except for a part the width of the driveway. It's a narrow drive, and my parents' trucks were parked there, so whoever came by had to squeeze past the trucks, dump the bike in the yard, and get back out. I checked the truck and noticed a scuff mark on the bumper that could have come from the handlebars.

 I looked over at the neighbor's house, and none of their cars were home; plus it was mid-morning during the school year, so I figured none of the kids would be there either. At first, I was just going to drop it on the curb, but my emotions were already running high from stress over my dad being sick and all the other crap they pulled since they moved in. I went back inside, grabbed a marker, wrote ""FREE"" on a piece of paper, and taped it to the handlebars. I parked the trike on the curb, where I could see it from the living room window, and waited. About an hour later, a random truck passed by, backed up and parked in front of the bike, and a guy got out and threw it in the bed, and left.

Later that night, the kids' mom was knocking on the door. She said her son left his bike in front of our house on the sidewalk, and asked if I had seen it. I told her no, nobody had been home the last couple of days, but that I didn't see one when I got there that afternoon. She didn't seem happy, but left without any other questions.

I told my parent about it at the hospital later; Mom said it was kind of a dick move, and Dad thought it was decent payback for all the crap the kids pulled. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	142.0	62.0	0.0	0.0

This dog was on its last legs 2 years ago when I last saw her. At that time, the dog was barely able to walk, couldn’t do stairs, had trouble eating, didn’t always make it outside for potty time, just generally looking like an old dog starting to have some trouble. She went the extra mile though, and took good care of the dog. 

I recently reconnected with my friend, and she told me the dog was still alive, and would love to see me. We went to her house, and I SWEAR, I just about broke down. The poor dog can not walk (she carries her inside and outside, and holds the dog up most of the time because it can barely stand), the dog can not eat or drink well, she squirts stuff into the dog’s mouth after she packs towels under her head to minimize spillage, and she holds the dogs head up to eat/drink, (I don’t think the dog is able), the dog is missing patches of fur, and I didn’t get too close, but I think there’s an open wound. The dog was NOT happy to see me, the dog didn’t notice I was there. The dog looks like death. The worst thing is the SMELL! You smell the dog as soon as you walk in the house. I have NEVER seen anything this bad. 

I guess I shouldn’t have said anything?? But of course, that message didn’t make it through my thoughts at the time. I told me friend what I thought. That this dog has no quality of life, seems to be in constant pain, and that it seems to be cruel to keep her alive.

Reasonably I'm upset, so I told him I can't stay in a relationship if he can't promise to stop and can't promise this will NEVER happen again/he will stop contact with the girl. He can't promise the latter two things.

c1s0u9	2019-06-17 19:37:28	hankprot	WIBTA if I (30F) confronted my friends about sharing personal information when I asked them not to?	"  

My supervisor was placed under investigation for harassment and just generally being an asshole to people. Many people at the company had reported him including my friends Julia, Rose and Harriet. It was a very stressful time for all of us, but we bonded considerably over the situation. We all became close and spent time together outside of work on several occasions.

Over time, the investigation became the only topic of conversation. Talking about our supervisor became an obsession in the group. I tried my best to stay neutral, but I knew it wasn't healthy so I discussed my concerns with the other girls. I said I felt that it was unhealthy for me to talk about the supervisor all the time and I felt like we were stalking him by searching social media for him and his family. I said that I knew it was frustrating that the investigation was taking time but that it would be better for us to try and move on and wait to see what happens.

Everything seemed to be going okay until a few months later when Julia lets us know that she wanted to release the report that was put together by HR. I tried to be tactful about the situation even though I disagreed. My reasoning was that many other people were involved in the investigation and they shared very personal information so if she was planning to share that with anyone that she should obtain permission from everyone (even though no names would be provided, I felt uncomfortable since when everyone reported they were told it would be confidential).

We didn’t argue but it was clear that I was the only one in disagreement with her decision. After this, communication between us dropped off. Julia and Harriet slowly stopped spending time with me (they stopped inviting me to things and kept saying they were busy when I would invite them). This was strange because we had been talking/texting/hanging out nearly every day. Despite reaching out to Julia and Harriet to see if they are okay, I stop hearing from Julia completely and Harriet only responds briefly when I contact her. Since we all have new assignments, I don't see them at work either even though we all still work at the same company.

A month goes by, and one day people start approaching me at work because of the report, it mentions very personal information without names so nobody knows how involved I am and they are expressing concern for me and making assumptions about my involvement, which is especially awkward because I didn't even know the report had been released. 

I feel pretty offended that Julia didn't think to give me a heads up about sharing the report. I want to confront both Julia and Harriet about all of this. They never said that I upset them but their actions are making me feel like maybe I am missing something. I'm also afraid if I do confront them that it won't go well, since I am confronting them to let them know what they did was wrong (in my opinion) and I’m not sure I even want to continue the friendship.

c1s0pq	2019-06-17 19:37:12	Ospinra	AITA Would my mom be the asshole for kicking a homeless person out of her restaurant?	"Sorry if the title seems confusing but I originally had the title as WMMBTA (Would my mom be the asshole) but the mods won’t let me have that title. 

So recently I visited my mom’s restaurant while I was in town. It was in an urban area so there were a lot of homeless people on the streets. I sat down at a table with my mom and we discussed things, when a homeless man came in with a bag. He walked to the bathroom and that’s when my mom saw him out of the corner of her eye and she started yelling. She screamed for the police officer, a good friend of hers, that was present at the time to kick him out. And he did. The homeless guy had old clothes in the bag and wanted to use the bathroom to clean himself and wash his clothes real quick. After that incident, I felt really guilty and felt bad for the guy. Especially after looking at his face while he was being told to get out. He didn’t resist or say a word, just quietly left with a sad look of sorrow on his face. My mom has this mindset that you shouldn’t give to the homeless money, only food in some cases. She thinks people are homeless because they are lazy and just won’t work hard enough so they take the easy life by asking for money everyday. I asked her “do you think people enjoy this life?” And she says “homeless people don’t mind picking in the trash for food.” She has this mindset because she and my dad were born poor and worked for every penny they got to be this successful. And right now, I don’t know if she was right to do what she did. Is she the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0	10.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

She gets paid well but has a long commute and works long, late hours.  Her drive is upwards of 4 hours depending on traffic (this is not wildly uncommon for the area, due to housing prices etc).  Her ex's apartment is between her company and our apartment.  Her ex, whom she is still friends with, offered to let her crash at his place, since he has a whole extra guestroom, if she gets too tired between driving from work and home.

&#x200B;

She has taken him up on this multiple times.  She has recently started liking more of his photos on social media, including one of him showcasing his new -pack abs and left the comment, ""daaamn!""

&#x200B;

I told her I was no longer comfortable with her crashing the night there in his guestroom, and she is currently mad at me, stating that I would rather her get in a car accident (due to tired/groggy driving) than let her sleep in a place I am paranoid about something happening.

She says that she meant it to be asking how I felt about it but when she phrased it “I feel bad because we were going to do something” I felt like she was saying she felt bad because we weren’t doing anything anymore and she was going to do something with her friend. 

She said that we technically didn’t have plans yet and that it’s “unfair for you to make me feel bad for hanging out with someone other than me.” But I feel like it’s unfair for her to make plans (although ‘technically’ not) and then cancel to go hang out with another friend. 

So... AITA for being upset with her for kind of making plans with me and then telling me later that she wants to hang out with her other friend instead?

We are both working professionals with a ton of student debt. My girlfriend and I own a dog, which stays in our apartment, and my mother owns a dog who sometimes shows aggression to other dogs. My dog and mother's dog get along very well, however.

My sister visits with her partner about once a week and brings her small dog with her, which results in my dog and my mother's dog being locked up in our apartment, coordinating potty-breaks/walks so the dogs stay separated, and feeding mom's and my dog separately since one has allergies, etc. My GF works remote and odd hours so sometimes the doggy babysitting interrupts her work at home, as well. 

That is annoying enough, but recently, my mom's dog got out and attacked my sister's dog. Thankfully none of the dogs were seriously injured, but it was a pretty scary close call. My mother is a pushover when it comes to these things, but I asked my sister to no longer bring her dog. I don't want to be responsible for anyone's animal getting injured. She responded 'Mom is fine with it. Butt out.' She has continued doing this and thinks I am being an asshole. Am I in the wrong here? 

Additional context: 
1. No one brings their animals to their apartment because it wouldn't be allowed. 
2. They sent their dog to a trainer so it is fully kennel and potty-trained. There are no concerns about leaving the dog alone at their place as they both work and frequently do this, anyhow. 
3. Also, neither my sister or her partner have thanked us for doing this. It is just expected that we do it."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1rxwv	2019-06-17 19:30:51	yazz9	AITA for not wanting to see my other half tonight ?	" Here me out , explaining the subject here :

 

Bit of a back story – my other half and I, have been together for over 3 years now. After a year, he moved in with me (I live with my mum as she is a single parent and I take care of her). Due to some complications with my mum, he recently moved out and rents a room out not too far away from me.

Now we went from seeing each other every day, falling asleep together etc to seeing each other every other day due to my work. I recently had tonsillitis and I’m on a course of antibiotics which made me extremely tired and weak. 

We haven’t seen each other for 2 days as I was working my weekend shift which is a 9,5 hour shift , I finished work yesterday and went to see him straight away, we watched a film and spoke a bit but half way through the film I fell asleep as the antibiotics really are getting the best of me plus a 7 day week with my weekend shift. I woke up this morning to find him being “in a mood” with me for falling asleep as he missed me and wanted to spend time with me. May I add that he is currently not working and has time to do things so as soon as I’m not at work, he would like me to come to his and ideally sleep over. I normally am ok with that but the past week with tonsillitis and work is really wearing me off. He asked me to come over tonight but I’m really not feeling well cos of the illness, I explained that to him as politely as I could be he got mad at me and said I don’t want to see him and spend time with him recently (only because I’m ill).

Am I the A-hole here for being selfish and wanting to get better and neglecting him? I need an opinion from other people looking into this situation. Thanks, I won’t be offended lol."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1rxh0	2019-06-17 19:29:51	Milka888	AITA for getting a ride operator at a childrens’ amusement park fired?	"Since my kids (6 & 8) were really little, I have been taking them to a local children’s amusement park. It’s a really little park, with maybe 10 or so rides. They love it there, and over the course of the past few summers we usually go 1-2 times a week.

We were in line for the log flume ride when my son asked if he could go to the bathroom. I said yes, and let him go on his own since the bathroom was in my view. Even though there was no line, he took absolutely forever (as he often does), and I was concerned he wouldn’t be back in time to board the ride. When he finally got out, he walked back at a snail’s pace, and I called out to him, “Come on, let’s hurry it up!” When he continued walking slow, I called out again, “Pronto!” and clapped my hands a couple times.

Immediately after I did this, I heard a long, fierce growl from the ride operator/boarder who was standing nearby, and he began muttering all sorts of obscenities (fuck, shit, son of a bitch, goddamn) loud enough for people in his vicinity to hear. After a while of doing this he angrily mimicked my “pronto!” and clapping; which indicated to me he thought I had been saying this and the “hurry up!” to **him**.

I told him politely, “Sir, I wasn’t saying that to you. I was talking to my son.” He gave me an angry look, indicating he didn’t believe me, and kept on grousing. As he boarded my kids and I he continued scowling and muttering, and I said to him again, “Sir, really. I promise I wasn’t saying that to you.” Again, he clearly didn’t believe me. We went on the ride, and when we got off, he flashed me another horrid scowl and gestured angrily towards the exit.

That night, I sent an email to the manager/customer service contact provided on the amusement park site detailing what had happened, and received a response the next day apologizing profusely, and offering free tickets for a day. The next couple times I went to the park with my kids, I didn’t see the guy there (I’d seen him there most days the previous two years), got a bit concerned and when I saw the lady I recognize as the assistant manager walking around, I asked her if he was still there. She told me he’d been fired last week.

I feel sort of guilty about getting the guy fired. That wasn’t what I expected or was hoping when I sent the email, and I’m of kind of wondering if I made too big of a deal. I can see why an employee would be really mad if they thought someone was yelling “hurry up!” to them (even though I wasn’t). Was I in the wrong?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So for context he married a girl who is from Russia for the explicit version of her getting her USA citizenship, from what I know there is a monetary incentive for him in this arrangement. normally i wouldn't give two shits about this and let live. But one of my closest friends got married to a girl from Brazil and its been a huge pain in the ass for them proving that they are in fact a couple and not trying to scam the system so she can get citizenship. 

My coworker who got the green card marriage is very vocal and honest about it, so its not like its really confidential info. from what Ive gathered his 'wife' comes from a middle/ upper middle class family in Russia. The way he talks about her is grating on me too he keeps talking about how good of a guy he is because he's never made/asked her to have sex with him. along with making degrading comments all the time.

We mainly just help the kids out with studying and understanding concepts prior to tests to help prepare them. The specific HS we tutor at is rather poor and decided at the beginning of the school year last August that they could barely afford to employ us for a measly 6 hours a week at minimum wage. I know what you’re thinking, just get a better job but I’m seriously considering becoming a teacher and if I were to, I would love to work at this school so I’m trying to increase my reputation. 

Anyway, my one coworker is extremely unreliable, not showing up with no explanation for maybe a day every week. This wouldn’t be a problem if I weren’t the only coworker and all of the responsibility then fell on me, I’m not able to help all the kids, days (or even hours) before a test and they get bummed out after getting unfavorable scores. 

Now, here’s where the big issue presents itself. At the beginning of the year minimum wage was increased by a dollar which might not seem like much but with our tight budget we found out we wouldn’t be working the last two weeks - making me miss out on 12 hours of work that I really enjoy and of course the money that comes with it, not to mention the kids have finals coming up and could really use us. 

Remember how I said that my coworker doesn’t show up? Well he still writes that he shows up on the time sheets that we turn in at the end of every month, getting paid for the days he wasn’t there. I don’t consider myself jealous of them even when they “work” an hour or two more than me because I truly do enjoy this job but simple math will tell you that he’s taking money out of the budget that could have gone to me working at the last two weeks of the year. I’m all about sticking it to the man but I feel like my coworker is just directly screwing me over. At this point I was upset and told my boss to keep a close eye on his time sheet to make sure it’s true as my coworker fudges the numbers (writes that he shows up when he doesn’t ) every month.

EDIT: We WILL end up being paid for the last two weeks which sounds good but apparently it’s coming out of the kids leftover banquet fund that they spent the year fundraising for.

c1rr9s	2019-06-17 19:16:13	valentine_artist	AITA for getting mad at a girl who copied my tattoo and refusing to tattoo her?	"Throwaway for professional reasons.

I (24m) am a tattoo artist with quite a large following online. For those of you who aren't really into tattoo culture, a big issue in the community is tattoo copying. This is essentially when someone takes a tattoo someone has, and gets another artist to trace the design and get it on them. This is seen as stealing within the community (as designs for us are sold) and is incredibly disrespectful. Any decent artist will not copy a tattoo. I've spoken a lot about this online, as it happens to me a lot, as well as other artists I know.

Last week I had a woman come in for an appointment with me. She was heavily tattooed (I mention this because I think it makes it less likely that she didn't know that tattoo copying is wrong) and two of those were stolen designs I had done on another client. One of them was meaningful to the client, the other was a flash design I did. She showed me the tattoos after I finished designing the tattoo for her that she was getting that day. The conversation went something like:

""I saw these two tattoos on your instagram and had to have them. They're actually done really well and were a good way to tide me over until I could get to you""

""Uh, thanks? Just for the future, most artists don't appreciate it when you copy their work. Those tattoos are supposed to be one-offs.""

""It's a compliment though, really""

""Haven't you ever heard of this issue?""

""Yeah I've heard all the drama about copying tattoos, but I don't see why it's an issue. I wouldn't care if someone copied mine so, who cares.""

That's when I got quite mad. I told her that not only is she acting very ignorant, she is disrespectful and essentially stealing my artwork (she hadn't changed either of the designs at all). I told her to get out of my shop and not to return, as we don't tattoo people who don't respect the industry. I also didn't refund her £100 deposit as she still spent time in the studio getting a design drawn when I could have had another client.

She left a review saying I'm an asshole. The rest of my studio agreed with me on the issue, but we all agree we can see how someone outside the industry might not agree. AITA?

&#x200B;

Update: just to clarify, the deposit was for the design itself. It was a large design that was going to take up her whole thigh, so it took a long time to draw up. I could have had another client in that time.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you so much for the feedback. There's a lot of debate in the comments so I just wanted to give a brief, general overview of what is generally seen as stealing when it comes to tattoos:

Stealing:

\- Taking a picture of another tattoo to an artist and asking for the exact same thing, with no changes.

Not stealing:

\- Getting a pop culture tattoo. A large corporation cannot tattoo you and you are therefore not taking away potential income from anyone by taking a picture of Mickey Mouse to a tattoo artist.

\- Taking inspiration from other tattoos. Taking pictures of tattoos to your artist and saying 'I like this, can I get something similar/with a few changes?' is fine.

\- Buying a design from an artist (tattoo or otherwise) and asking an artist to tattoo it on you.

\- Getting permission from the original artist AND the client with the tattoo (although finding an artist who will copy another's tattoo is generally an indication of their quality)."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1rpo0	2019-06-17 19:12:31	nebslol	AITA for not saying “Happy Father’s Day” to my grandpa?	"I apologize in advance for formatting issues. I am on mobile. 

I have been dancing for about 11 years and I absolutely love it. The dance studio I go to doesn’t compete; we dance because it’s fun and we love it. This dance studio is very accepting and overall a very friendly community. When a new person joins the studio, we do not hesitate to welcome them and make them feel right at home. Most of the teachers at the studio are apart of or supporters of the LGBTQ+ community. 

The owner of the studio is gay and has a husband who also works at the studio. They got married in 2014 (when gay marriage was legalized in my state). When my grandpa found out that the studio owner got married to a person of the same sex, he suddenly stopped coming to my dance recitals. Back then I was younger and thought nothing of it (my thoughts were “Oh he must have work that’s why he doesn’t come to my recitals.”), but as I got older, I started to become more aware of what the LGBTQ+ community was. I also found out that my grandpa doesn’t even work on weekends (the show days are Saturday and Sunday on the weekend of father’s day) and he would leave every time I had a to go to my recital. 

Him not showing up to something that is really important to me hurts because 1. I’ve been dancing for the longest time and suddenly he doesn’t show up to the shows and 2. I’m apart of the LGBTQ+ community myself. This morning I kind of snapped on my grandma (G). The conversation went like this: 

𝗚: Did you say happy father’s day to Butchie (my grandpa’s nickname)
𝗠𝗲: *silence* 
𝗚: How did you not say happy father’s day to someone that lives in your house? That’s really hurtful. 
𝗠𝗲: It’s also hurtful when your grandfather doesn’t show up to your recital because [owner of dance studio] is gay. 
𝗚: *silence* *walks into living room*

That’s when I knew it was true. That’s when I knew he doesn’t come to my recitals because he’s anti-LGBTQ+. My family often forgets that I’m 15 and not 5. I have a better understanding of the world more and more everyday and it seems like they’re not catching on. I guess I was just too mad at him to say “happy father’s day”. If he doesn’t support the studio owners sexuality, he certainly won’t accept mine. 

So, am I the asshole?

Edit: I left a few details out (which I’ve responded to in the comments). Yes, I have tried talking to him but he shut it right down. I just stopped trying after that because he’s stubborn. It’s also pretty sus that he stopped coming to the recitals as soon as the owner got married. I also over heard him talking to my grandma saying “I’m not going to sit there and watch f*gs prance around on a stage”."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I’ve been best friends with this girl (we’ll call her E) for around three years now, but last summer she moved to a city about an hour away, so we can’t see each other very much. 

I don’t have my license yet, and neither does my other best friend. (we’ll call her V) We’re a trio and have been for about two years, I knew V longer than E. 

V and I made plans with E to go up to her house this week, (these plans were made around a month ago) and E was perfectly fine with it and we started to talk about all the things we could do since E lives on a huge property with a lake and lots of land. We always have tons of fun together when it’s the three of us. 

Yesterday, E texted V and I to let us know that a few of her new friends from her new school were going to be hanging out with us two days during our four days together. She didn’t even ask us if that was okay before making the plans. 

Now, that wouldn’t sound like such a big deal, but E’s friends treat V and I like we are white trash. We’re from a more ghetto city, while E’s city is very upper class and the majority of the kids at her school are rich.  V and I are definitely not white trash, we both live in very nice homes and our families make great money, but in our area that’s not very common. 

At E’s birthday party in February, E blew both of us off completely while only talked to her new friends. Of course, V and I were upset and decided to just hang by ourselves the entire time. It was brutal, every girl there talked about how trashy we are, how we don’t belong, etc. I even heard a girl refer to me as a whore during the party. 

We explained to E how we felt uncomfortable with her friends coming over, and that it would be more fun if it was just the three of us. E was pissed, calling us selfish and saying we’re being assholes.

c1rnds	2019-06-17 19:07:25		AITA for not wanting to talk to my mom after she refused to help with college expenses and told me to drop out if I couldn’t figure it out?	"Basically how this started was that I dropped out of high school when I was 16 because of my complications following the brutal divorce of my parents.  Later, I got my GED, built a successful construction career, entered into the real estate business and now have financed my college career up to my AA which I am about 2 classes away from achieving.  Here’s the problem:

In order to complete my bachelor’s degree, I have to attend the state university which means I have to move to a new city.  This isn’t a problem emotionally, but I can’t afford it with the job I have (part time due to school $11.50 an hour, had to stop real estate full time to work on my degree).  I am currently attempting to get back into the real estate business to help finance this move, but it’s going to cost about $1500 which I currently just do not have and will not be available for a while without assistance.  When I asked my mother (40 year old nurse) for help with rent while I try to get a better wage or get into real estate again, she got mad and basically said “well I figured it out so you can too.  I raised you and your sister by myself on $5 an hour and still went to school” which is fundamentally untrue.  My father financed her degree and worked construction 60+ hours a week to supplement the income and maintain the home that my grandparents had bought for my mom and dad following my birth.   She then told me that “well maybe you should just quit school and go back to work if you can’t afford it”.  The reality is that I simply am asking for her to split a $300 subsidy with my father (he has agreed already) in order to bring my rent down to an affordable level considering my current wage.  Tuition is not an issue as I have student loans, but rent prices where I need to be living near exceed $1250 for small apartments.  When I pitched this to her she said “I would give it to you but you wouldn’t appreciate it you would probably just spend it on clothes”.  Which is just simply non-sense.

I feel that I’m being left kind of high and dry with no explanation.  I don’t think I’m asking for something extravagant, and especially considering that this is something that would enable me to better my education and career and that my father has agreed to split the bill.  Am I the asshole for not talking to her because of this?  I feel that if someone is going to compare apples to oranges and then insult me over asking for help, then I have no interest in talking to them."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1rnav	2019-06-17 19:07:14	ocd_coder	AITA for not wanting to participate in sports because of a slow team mate	"So every year my social group go out to the park and have a family day. This usually consists of food and games and lots of sports.

I really enjoy volleyball and have played for a long time but when everyone is playing I choose not to play. And this makes people upset. 

There's a slow person in our group, that we will call Dave. He's not autistic or low functioning, just different. Dave's a sweet guy who always wants to participate but he's not very sporty and doesn't have much hand-eye coordination.

When we play Dave always wants to play and nobody would ever deny him a game. That's not a problem. Everyone should play and have a good time. 

I am competitive and want to play to win. Dave may get placed on my team and if he is, the opposition will make sure to force errors out of him for easy points. 

I don't mind losing if I know I played my best, but when Dave is playing, on my team or on the opposition's, I feel like the game becomes less serious and I feel like I'm wasting my time. 

Knowing myself, and without telling anyone my feelings about playing with Dave, I choose to not play. This prevents me from getting frustrated and allows me to enjoy the day with the families. I also will only decline to play if I know that there are enough players to continue without me.

So AITA?

Edit: the guys we play with can at times be competitive, even though it's a family day. The usual trash talk ensues as one would expect in a friendly sporting competition. The trash talking also riles me up and makes me want to play well with a team that is capable (this may be a failing of my character, but it's one that I understand and am willing to deal with) . Dave's character and traits are well established in the group and he is like family. Everyone accepts him and I do too. But I can't control the other players who will take advantage of the fact that Dave is a weak link in the team. Also there are many activities to take part in during the day, so I do feel like it's wasting time if I can spend the time having fun with other activities."	No A-holes here	0	0	10.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

They have no way of knowing if someone left it there or if some idiot threw it down while they were passing by but yet they're going to charge the person whose door it's in front of.

You're not allowed to have a grill outside, you're not allowed to have house plants in front of your door, oh and and don't expect your kids to have a normal childhood if you are going to live here. They aren't allowed to play with sidewalk chalk, they aren't allowed to ride bikes, they aren't allowed to skateboard oh, nothing. Basically they aren't even allowed to play outside. Like I've seen them throwing a football around and such but nothing other than that. I think it's ridiculous. I don't even have kids and I still think it's ridiculous.

What's the big deal about kids riding their bikes or playing with sidewalk chalk? Sidewalk chalk goes away with water. So now all of a sudden my roommate just told me that the manager of this place is upset with me for posting a negative comment on Facebook about this. Well I'm not retracting it. It's the truth. If they don't like it then they should change their ridiculous rules. Let's not talk about how I've been approached three times now asking if I wanted to buy dope and how somebody else left a negative review talking about how their friend was robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot and how I heard automatic gunfire one night.

But yet I'm the asshole for telling the truth about this place and warning people not to come here because not only did all this other stuff happen but now they're raising our rent another $50. They never fix anything around here. If your air conditioner breaks in the middle of summer than God help you because they're not going to fix it in a timely manner. I've put in maintenance requests in it his taking them as long as two weeks to come fix the issue. But yet they want to get mad at me for posting about it. Also, the place is infested with roaches and I'm tired of it. I've learned not to leave any open food unattended for even two seconds because I have literally seen these little fuckers dropping down from inside my cabinets. It's disgusting.

 I'm about ready to just break my lease and move out of here. So am I the asshole for posting the negative comment? If they try to throw me out of here based on that then I can sue them because it's illegal. They'd be trampling on My First Amendment right to freedom of speech."

I can't recall the exact wording but it was along those lines. I blew up at her and told her that was extremely hurtful, and humiliating to be extremely obviously removed from a photo (she had even posted the full uncropped one while we were together) in front of all her friends/followers. But she and all of her girlfriends told me that she is strong and independent and she can do whatever she wants, and she liked the picture of herself so she was free to post it. I gave up and the picture remains on the website.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today, she has posted another picture of what used to be us together, but I've been cropped out. It made me really upset, so I sent a screenshot to my friends. They basically told me that it's shitty, but she can post whatever she wants if she liked the picture of herself. I've already unfollowed her, but our friend group is so close knit I'm sure I'll hear about the next incident whether I want to or not.

So it's been a few years since I've been in regular contact with these friends of mine. For some backstory, I was classmates with these guys and the class had only a few of us in it so we always were quite close? Like we would hang out sometimes and even study together. Even after graduation, we met occasionally for special occasions. 

During the time I knew them, I was kind of in a depressive phase where I constantly wallowed in self-doubt and self-pity. I even considered taking my life a few times. I never really made it clear to them but I think they understood what I was going through. During this time, I always doubted the sincerity of our friendship and sometimes I believed that behind my back they would be talking shit about me. I thought this way because they had shunned one of my classmates too but they never made it too obvious. So by that logic, who's to say they didn't do it to me?

Recently I had an epiphany and did some re-evluating on my relationships. I managed to get out of my depressive phase which is great and all but I came to a conclusion that my friendship with these people had not been what I initially believed it was. It hurts me to say this but it feels like I barely know the 'real' them and at best, I can only say we're acquaintances. 

We met again recently and I realised that I couldn't fit in with them or have conversations that truly resonated with me. I felt out of place. I also know that they've kept contact with each other but I've not exactly been in the loop and it kinda sucks. Now, I've been making up excuses that I can't meet with them but in all honesty I'm just too awkward to want to meet them and I'm not really too excited to see them either. This is vastly different from how I feel when I'm with my close friends.

Just a few days ago, one of them invited me to hang out for a party. Being me I made another lame excuse. This time, I was met with a not so happy response from the person who said something along the lines of ""This again?"" And ""so and so will be disappointed"" before passing it off as a friendly joke.

&#x200B;

Okay, so this is still kind of going on, because people are percistant.

&#x200B;

In Denmark, we have ten years of manditory school, and I am just finishing my final year (Yay!) and just finished my last exam. Now, I made tons of notes for this exam. It was math and I did countless hours of work that earned me a very nice 10. (Our scale goes from -3, 00, 02, 04, 07, 10 and 12).

This was a group exam in oral math. My group really dislikes me, to say the least. They are now claiming that I am stealing their notes and did no work and that all of my notes were made with help from them. None of them were. Now they are annoyed that I do not want to share all of my notes with a classmate that never does any work and always just copies from other people so they can, ""make sure the answers are right"".

I politely told them that:

1. Maybe they should start off by telling me that, rather than sending messages like ""It's urgent"" ""Come on"" ""Stop ignoring me"" and not telling me what they wanted from me before 30 minutes of messaging was finally done.
2. I don't currently have my notes, because I am out eating sushi with my family to celebrate finalising my madatory schooling.
3. I don't feel comfortable giving out my notes to anyone. No matter what.

&#x200B;

I may have gotten less polite as time went on and threatened to throw my notes in the garbage, and that was definitely wrong.

I just wonder if I'm being unreasonable? Should I just send the notes anyway now that I'm home? Or should I stand firm and not send them my notes?

c1rgsm	2019-06-17 18:53:21	laidback_hoser	WIBTA if I reported my relative-in-law for disability fraud?	"So, full disclosure, I have personal beef with this in-law that dates back over a decade as they have always tried to exclude me from the family and stir up drama by talking behind my back (which is fucked up because I was still a shy teen looking for acceptance and they’re 5 years older), etc . This really ramped-up my anxiety and affected my self confidence. 

This is why I think I’m probably TA since there is definitely a vindictive part of my intention.

However this person has always tried to find a way to get hand-outs. Has never put much effort into any job (not showing up/calling-in frequently, mouthing off supervisors, gossiping about coworkers) and so has gotten fired often. Has turned down jobs because they had to get up too early. They got their schooling paid for by a gov’t program, got some part time work for a few years (shift work but they refused all the inconvenient hours like evenings and weekends) and then, soon after starting to complain about not liking the work, filed for workers’ compensation for a “back injury” that was actually a foot injury that happened at home. So this wouldn’t be the first time this person has defrauded taxpayers.

For the past year or two, they have been on a disability pension for fibromyalgia. This person has since offered to watch my children “anytime”, dances all night long at weddings and parties, lifts heavy boxes of craft supplies all the time. I understand that fibro means there are good days and bad, but I have yet to see them have a bad day during anything fun or self-serving. Furthermore, if you can babysit a baby and a toddler “anytime”, can’t you find work as a childcare provider!?

The clincher: Recently, this person has started a small online business on social media doing some custom crafts. They have actually said to people that if they want something, they must go to their “business page” and not their personal one or it could affect their pension if they’re caught. So they aren’t declaring that income. It probably isn’t much money, maybe 100-200$/month, for now, but it’s only been a few months. 

As an honest taxpayer who paid for schooling with loans and worked many shitty jobs to get to the half-decent one I have now, this doesn’t sit right. Many people are actually severely disabled and rely on those funds. They should go to the truly needy. 


The attitude of people around me have is that I should mind my own business and let the chips fall where they may. I feel ill every time this person shows me their new “creation” (usually stolen from other crafters on social media). So AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	989.0	19.0	0.0	0.0
c1rg16	2019-06-17 18:51:43		AITA for “harassing” my uncle because I would like to meet him and he doesn’t want that?	"I come from the “trashy” branch of my family. Mom is mentally ill and abusive, dad spent 20+ years in prison, both are junkies and first cousins. I was born in the middle of drugs, violence, mental illness and incest, yet I somehow did good for myself. I’m 24 and I just completed my PhD (2 years ahead!), despite being the first in my side of the family to ever complete high school, much less college. I have a very bad relationship with my parents and siblings, I’ve been independent since I was a teenager, I have a good job.

My regret comes from my uncle (dad’s brother). He is like me, coming from a shit family but rising above his station and becoming the CFO of a rather large corporation all on its own merit. He is very much a family man, he gives $10,000 to each of his nephews and nieces every year because he doesn’t have kids himself and he actively participated to raise them. My branch of the family (my parents, my siblings and me) are the only ones excluded from it. For good reason, because my parents stole a lot from him for drugs, they were usually rude to my uncle and the last time he saw my father, dad threatened him at gunpoint to steal $20k.

But while I respect his hatred for my parents, I feel unjustly punished. All my cousins are homeowners thanks to his gifts, they all live pretty great lives while I had to live in poverty and crawl my way up with no support. Now that I “made it,” I would like to be judged on my own merit. I would accept it if he doesn’t want to give me the $240,000 I would have gotten from him if I were born in another branch of the family, but I want to hear it from his mouth. I also mostly want to have a relationship with my uncle, because my entire life, despite never meeting him, I considered him a role model to motivate me to get out of my family’s hole.

I tried to contact him through cousins who see him often, through mail, etc, but he always ignored me. I eventually went to his house and rang the bell, but nobody opened the door although he was home. Finally, I went to his workplace and talked to his secretary, but I was told that my uncle was locked in his office and that I had to vacate the premises or the cops would be called. I just wanted to talk to my uncle, for god’s sake.

After that, I received a mail from my uncle, essentially telling me that he considered me trying to contact him and showing up at his home and work “harassment.” He demands I stop or he’ll press charges. I was never told to back off before what feels like the nuclear option, and I never did anything to warrant him treating me so badly (even though i’m related to people who did). I will drop it and stop trying to see him, I guess, but was I wrong to try and meet my uncle like I did?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I am a 17 years old about to turn 18 and a choice I need to make is if I should stay in contact with my uncle or not. For the point of the story my uncle will be Bob and my cousin will be Jim. 

When I was 6 or 7 my dad told me I won't be seeing my uncle Bob anymore because he ran away with his new girlfriend. It was tough for the whole family because we all respected him and thought of him as a good dad. He signed away his rights to his son Jim who was a year younger than me. Jim was crushed, he developed a fear of relationships (except for his mom) because he was afraid everyone would abandon him. He grew super attached to his mom because he didn't want her to leave him too. It was tough because he got super quiet and never talked to anyone. About 4 or 5 years later Bob moved back to Maine and got in contact with his parents again. Jim's mom immediately cut contact with my family. My dad told me what happened and informed me that next time I go to my grandma's house Bob would be there. I was reluctant to see him but my dad forced me because ""he's family"", when I got to my grandma's Bob was acting like nothing happened like he didn't disappear for 5 years. It made me mad because of how bad be hurt Jim. At that point I decided I want nothing to do with Bob. 

It's been 5 years since Bob first came back and my opinion hasn't changed. I'm about to turn 18 and I'll be going to college soon, so my dad won't be able to force me to have contact with Bob. I want to tell my grandma that when I come visit her I don't want Bob to be there (I moved to North Carolina a couple years ago so I don't see my grandma that often) it's going to crush her because she has become close with Bob over the last 5 years. I can only see my grandma once a year because she lives 2000 miles away so when I do she likes to do things as a family which means Bob is there. 

Today I went to lunch with my mom and explained how I've been feeling to her and told her what I want to do. She told me that even though she isn't a fan of Bob that he is family and deserves a second chance. I don't know if I can give him a second chance after what he did to Jim. To me abandoning you kid and then coming back and acting like nothing happened is unforgivable. 

I'm sorry if this is poorly written or explained if you have any questions or want me to clear something up let me know in the comments.

c1rdj5	2019-06-17 18:46:02	needalonetime101	WIBTA if I kick my boyfriend out of my apartment?	I’m a long time lurker of this thread, but this is my first post. Using a throwaway and mobile. So my boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years. I just finished graduate school and he’s in that weird limbo stage of life where he’s trying to figure out what he wants to do. He’s currently unemployed looking for work and living at home (just for the record, unemployed and living at home doesn’t bother me. I know he will find a job and be successful soon). Fortunately, I was lucky enough that my father rented an apartment for me for a year so I could go to grad school full time, so I don’t pay for anything involving the apartment except groceries. The apartment is a studio. Since I moved in, my boyfriend would come and go and everything was fine, but recently within the last month or so he gradually ended up kind of moving in with me. He has been staying with me every single night and goes home once a week to get clothes. He comes from a bad home life —low income family, lives in a two bedroom apartment with four other people, and other family issues. He also doesn’t have air conditioning in his apartment and it’s the summertime. He helps with groceries and household chores, but the apartment is so small. I’m starting to go crazy because I can never be by myself. It makes me happy that my boyfriend looks at my apartment as a safe and comfortable place and I’d love to actually move in with him one day, but this apartment is too small for the both of us. I would have no problem asking him to go home if home was somewhere he was comfortable, but I feel like an asshole if I do because of his situation. Just for the record, my boyfriend isn’t some mooching scum bag, he just prefers staying here. Like I said before, I don’t pay the rent, he helps with the groceries, and we’ve been dating for 4 years and have talked about getting married and moving in together in the future.

I am 21 (m) and my ex is 23 (f). Last year me and my girlfriend of 2 years broke up due to several small reasons that built up, we were both mature about it and were still friends afterwards after a few months, and today we talk a few times a week. Some of the things we talk about are work, friends, events, etc., and sometimes bring up people we were talking to. 

I never like hearing her talk about other guys and she obviously doesnt use details or anything, but sometimes she does say they slept together or heavily imply it. Well after 2 of her fwbs went bad and we had a talk about our relationship and we decided we arent meant to be together, I asked her if she would stop mentioning guys when we talk.

 I understand that friends talk about stuff like that but the extra layer of when we dated and the uneasy feeling I get hearing about it I asked her if she would just try to talk about anything else. I know I'm being irrational and that is what friends talk about but I dont enjoy talking about it and I dont like feeling uneasy when talking to a friend. 

I dont want her back, it's not jealousy, and I've told her if she honestly starts to date someone she can talk about it. In her defense when I do bring it up she says she will, but after about a week or two I start hearing about guys again that I know shes slept with due to prior talks and she says they're just friends now.

c1rdhx	2019-06-17 18:45:58	MaggsToRiches	WIBTA if I reported a homeless person sleeping at the bottom of the stairs, partially blocking the exit?	"I live in a large building in a major city in the US. Like most big cities, we have a significant population of homeless citizens. Many of them live in my neighborhood. 

The building has a primary entrance with a front desk, and two fire exits (exit only). I use the fire exit near my apartment almost exclusively during the day as it saves me a full city block walking from the primary entrance to the main street. I’ve been using this exit for a year without issue. For the past two weeks, a man has taken to sleeping on the landing outside of this fire exit. The first time I opened the door *hard* (it’s a heavy steel door), and was startled to hear someone cry out. I could see a pair of feet. (Note: you cannot get back into your floor after exiting to the stairwell, there is no option except to exit.) So I said “I’m sorry, excuse me, I have to open the door.” He didn’t move, I pushed the door as gently as I could and squeezed out. He yelled some profanities at me and I walked away. It happened again the next day....I had completely forgotten about the interaction until I opened the door on him again. With the exception of a couple of times, he has been out there for almost two weeks. I feel both sad and annoyed every time.

My concerns are: his safety, my safety, and fire safety. 

My hesitations are: wanting to treat homeless people with compassion and respect. Not wanting to add another layer of hard living to someone who has staked out a spot for themselves.

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I reported him to building management? I would imagine that would result in them going to tell him to move or them having the police tell him to move. Both orders may only be temporarily followed. Should I just use the main entrance and not complain about a longer walk when I should be grateful for having a home?"

Power and Internet/Cable are under my name and I give her so long until I cut cancel it all. She takes that time and I hold my word.

I gave her all the information she needed to remove my name from the power and the internet/cable contracts.

One month later, I am still getting calls to my phone from power and cable/internet about different things, meaning my name was still on the account. I told her she had one more week.

c1rcru	2019-06-17 18:44:19	billyeo	AITA for not siding with my gf in an argument	"hi guys, first time posting here and apologize for the grammer. 

So this happened around two summers ago. Me, my gf and her sister along with a group of friends planned a July 4th picnic at a state park. We got to the picnic area at around 10 am and saw that there were already a lot of families there. Most of the picnic benches were taken but we eventually found one with a single guy sitting on the edge of it. He seemed to be apart of a larger group and they had already claimed 3 benches for their own (those benches werent full and had plenty of room). We asked him if we could take the bench since they already had 3 benches and he was sitting alone on this last one. He said no and that he was holding it for the rest of the group and they were going to arrive later in the afternoon. Since we were here already and the state park rules says that people cannot “hold” benches, we asked him politely again if we could take it. He started to get annoyed and said his group would be here later. We were pretty livid and another family saw what was happening and joined us on asking if he could let go of the bench. He still said no so we decided to call the state police to have them settle the affair. Soon people from both sides were arguing back and forth and it started to get a bit nasty( verbally). Our side said he was greedy for hogging the table while their group wasnt there yet and his side stated that since they got here first, it was theirs. My gf and her sister started cursing and some mean exchanges were made. I told my gf to stop cursing and to stop using foul languages and she was shocked that I wasnt on her side. I said that we didnt need to get nasty with the arguing and could just wait for the police to settle things. 

 Eventually the state park police came and reinforced our statement that they couldnt hold benches but that we should all stop bickering since it was the fourth of July. Seeing that this one guy was hogging the last table and all the other tables were taken, they made a few calls to have some more benches bought in. The benches were soon delivered and then everyone had their benches. 

However my gf and her sister were pretty pissed with me for not siding with them and arguing against the group. (i was pretty quiet).

&#x200B;

 Alright, so before I start I need to explain a few things.

&#x200B;

I and my Grandma didn't use to live together, in fact, we lived around 2 hours apart. We used to get along quite a long and I called her every time I got upset at home due to the nightmare of a family I had to live with.

&#x200B;

After a while, I fell out with my Mum and her new boyfriend (2 years older than me at the time) and left home. My Grandma brought me in and let me stay with her for about 4, going on 5 years now. I helped around the house as much as I could but when it came night, it became quite hard to be friendly.

&#x200B;

So, here is the problem.

&#x200B;

Over the last few months, my job and friends have made it so I'm waking up and going to bed in the CST (Texas) Timezone, even though I live in the GMT (British) Timezone.

&#x200B;

Because of this, I tend to be talking to people around times like 1am-5am, sometimes later, and even though I try to lower my voice, I sometimes lose track of why I was being quiet and continue speaking in my normal speaking voice.

&#x200B;

This has led to more and more problems overall and I'm unsure how to deal with it. This morning an event happened...

&#x200B;

I was woken up at 9:30 am due to the sound of pans being hit together, music with bass speakers being played at the highest they can go and other noisy sounds. I later found out that the reason she was doing this was to get back at me for keeping her up and only letting her get 3 hours, even though I didn't even know she could hear me. Last night was a really late one so I didn't even fall asleep until 8:00 am GMT, so being woken up at 9:30 am instead of my normal wake up time, 2 pm was really bad for me.

&#x200B;

I guess the real question here is.. am I the asshole or is my Grandma?

c1rain	2019-06-17 18:39:07	throthrowthrowyaboat	AITA for refusing to do extra unpaid work for my boyfriend’s family business?	"My partner Joe* and his brother Andrew* inherited a business from their dad a year and a half ago. I’ve worked there part-time since then, Andrew’s wife Ellie* has been there a bit longer than me. The two of us do the accounts.

Joe and Andrew have worked there for years when their dad was the boss so they know the business, but having just taken it over the finances aren’t great. Joe broke the news to me that mine and Ellie’s hours would need to be capped at 10hrs a week, which wasn’t a surprise to me. I said I completely understood and that I’d get a second job.

To clarify; reducing my hours, while it sucks, isn’t the problem. I love Joe very much, I know how hard he works and I consider his family my family. I’m very willing to work less hours when they can’t afford to pay as much wages right now.

The problem is this: today, Andrew told me  that Ellie would be working around 15 hours a week despite only being paid 10, and very heavily suggested I should do the same. I told him flatly I wouldn’t work hours that I wouldn’t be paid for, that I’d work ten hours a week to match my pay. When I said this he tried to guilt me, essentially implying I had familial obligations to work for free. He then said that if it came to them needing to let someone go, I would be “the first one out the door”. Again, I already knew this, my role is the most expendable out of the 6 people here, but in this context felt like a threat.

Im not conflicted about being upset with the way Andrew spoke to me and how he approached the subject, he was for sure TA there, what I’d like this sub’s opinion on is whether refusing to do the extra work unpaid makes me TA, or is he TA for wanting me to. Joe is on my side with this, but Andrew and Ellie clearly think it’s expected. Joe pointed out that the other two members of staff, Mike* and Rob*, would never be asked to work a third of their hours unpaid and would probably walk out if asked, but then neither of them are family.

To add to this, they put me and Ellie on a finance course. Andrew apparently said to Joe that it annoyed him when I said I wouldn’t work for free as they paid for the course. While I’m grateful they did, it was never said it would need to be paid back. I thought they’d done it so we’d be better able to do the work. It’s worth pointing out that Mike and Rob have also been sent on training courses. They were not expected to pay back those costs but was considered a business expense.

This could cause a lot of problems between the brothers. Joe is fully in my corner with this and is angry with his brother, but Andrew’s made it clear he thinks he’s done nothing wrong and that I’m the unreasonable one. AITA?


TLDR: Boyfriend’s brother thinks I should work 15hrs a week while only being paid for 10hrs as we’re family and they paid for me to take a course.

(*Obviously, names changed and using a throwaway)

EDIT: ok, apparently this is an obvious NTA and I shouldn’t feel so worried.

I've always wished him a happy father's day. He's been a part of my life since I was 7,but last summer he told me that he was losing interest in my mom and instead found me sexually attractive and asked if I was interested in going anywhere with that.

I was horrified. I haven't told anyone else in my family about it because he immediately apologized and he was drunk and it's never been brought up again. But the way I figure it is if he doesn't see himself as my father which he clearly doesn't then I shouldn't wish him happy fathers day. It's my only petty revenge for doing that to me.

But AITA? My family is giving me a hard time for not saying anything. He hasn't said anything about it.

Where the trouble started is when my hometown friend, Mark, brought his wife, Cassie, to one of my parties where she met one of my newer/distant friends, Alex, who was there with his longtime girlfriend, Delilah. (All names are a little fake to cover my own ass here). Despite being at the party with their SOs, Alex and Cassie really hit it off and spent all night talking to just each other, no one else. A lot of people made comments to me about them. It’s obvious that they had extreme chemistry and an immediate connection. Everyone who saw them talking could tell there was a real spark there, but nothing came of it. 

I found out later that Delilah had confronted Alex about whether or not he had feelings for Cassie, and they got into a huge fight about it but eventually reconciled. Ominously, Cassie told me later that week that she and Mark were going to start attending marriage counseling at his family’s church. She didn’t mention Alex but that was the only thing I could think of when she mentioned the “problems” she and Mark were going through. 

Fast forward 6 months, the same thing happened 2 more times, Alex and Cassie had 2 more long, intimate, isolated talks at parties. I just found out that Cassie and Mark separated shortly after the last party, and have reached the point where they do not believe the marriage can be saved and are going to file for a divorce. 

I was having lunch with Alex the next day and for whatever reason, I mentioned that Cassie is getting divorced. I don’t know what reaction I expected, I just felt like if the roles were reversed, I would want to know, so I told him. He initially acted indifferent, but the next day he frantically called me because he broke up with Delilah after a huge fight over laundry and he doesn’t know where he’s going to live now because she threw him and all of his stuff out of her apartment. 

So now Alex needs to find a new place to live, and Cassie isn’t even fully divorced yet or even aware that Alex is available. He thinks it’s fate and it will all work out. I kind of agree but I didn’t think he would dump Delilah less than 24 hours after I told him about the divorce. I feel like I’ve set a chain of events in motion that has so far only negatively affected everyone involved, and even if Alex and Cassie wound up together, I’ve still hurt an equal amount of people to the amount that I would have helped.

Stepsons’ mom wants him to skip a birthday party to help his uncle reunify with uncle’s son. I don’t think it is fair that Stepson has to miss something he is excited for to fix his uncle’s mistakes. 

Edits: Due to the comments of initials being hard to read, I am trying to reword this. 

Background:
My Stepson is 10. His Uncle (stepson’s mom’s brother) is an addict in recovery, but lost custody of Todd at 1 yr old. Todd ended up in the ER for Dehydration, while in Uncle’s care. Todd’s maternal grandma, Anne, retained full custody.

Stepson the only person in his family who has had consistent contact with Todd since this occurred. I have attended church with Anne for 20 years, and the two kids are close in age. They are friendly, but don’t hang out outside of church.

Situation:
Uncle has been fighting for custody. He was recently grated visitation. They have meet a few times with a reunification councilor and are now progressing to spending time together outside of the counselors supervision. The counselor has requested that my Stepson along with Uncle and Todd for their first outside visit or two, so that Todd can ‘learn to trust’ Uncle (his dad).

Yesterday (Father’s Day):
My husband, Stepson and I are at a large outdoor event. My husband gets a text from stepson’s mom

Mom: what does your schedule look like the next couple of weekends with Stepson. The reunification counselor wants Stepson to be part of the next visits ...(see above). It should take about 3 hours. 

My husband turns to me to ask about the schedule. (Side note: Husband and I split household tasks fairly evenly- physical and mental/emotional tasks- and I handle the schedule. Stepson’s mom knows this, and sometimes texts me about schedule stuff.) Husband doesn’t want to deal with Stepson’s mom on Father’s day so I text her back.

Me: 6/22 Stepson has a baseball game in the morning and His Friend’s birthday party. 7/6 we have plans at the lake. 7/20 Stepson is free. 

Stepson’s Mom: this needs to happen sooner rather then later or it will hold up the remainder of the reunification process. 6/29 I have Stepson, but he has baseball tournament all Day. Stepson may have to miss His Friend’s party because family is more important. I will just talk to (my husband) about it and we will figure it out. 

Me: What is the latest appt time? Maybe it can happen after the party. Stepson shouldn’t have to miss it. Both Stepson and His Friend are excited that he is going. 

Stepson’s mom: it is not an appointment. It is between Anne and Uncle to work out the time. Like I said, he may have to miss it. I will just talk to (my husband) to figure it out. 

Me: We can make it work 6/22 at 4 or 5pm, or 7/6 first thing in the am.  

Stepson’s mom: it is up to Anne when it happens and it will have to work because family is important. I will just talk to (my husband) and we will figure it out. 

The problem:
- My point of view- Helping Family is great, but Stepson should not have to miss a birthday for His Friend he is looking forward, in order to help fix his Uncle’s mistakes. 

- Husband’s point of view- who cares if he misses one birthday party, let’s just get it over with so Stepson’s Mom will leave my husband alone about it. 

- Stepson’s Mom’s point of view- Family is more important."	Not the A-hole	0	0	13.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

"Edit: There seems to be a loss in translation and some context missing due to parts of the conversation being in a foreign language that doesn't translate to English completely. The part where the dad started speaking in Tagalog he was using highly offensive Tagalog curse words towards me as he talked shit about me to someone else. That's why I reacted the way I did. I apologize for the misunderstanding.


Fixed and reposted due to going over the character limit.


Not sure if this belonged here or r/entitledparents but I'll post it here for now.


I was at Jollibee (a popular fast food place from Philippines that made its way to America) in Virginia Beach for lunch since I haven't been there in a while. I got there a little past 1PM and placed my order at 1:19PM according to my receipt. It was super packed since it's Sunday and it's usually packed on Sundays so I expected my order to take a while to be ready. After waiting for an hour the beeper they handed me finally went off meaning my order was ready. As soon as I got back to my table there was a kid sitting on my seat so I asked him nicely to get off my seat since I was already sitting there. He got up and left. After he left I realized I forgot to grab utensils and napkins so I got back up to grab them. As soon as I got back to my table and sat down someone who I assumed was the father confronted me and the conversation went like this:


Guy: You just bullied my kid. How dare you?


Me: Huh? What are you talking about? I didn't bully your kid.


Guy: Yes you did. You just told my son to get off his seat.


Me: Yeah because that was my seat. I've been sitting here for an hour waiting for my order.


Guy: No you weren't.


Me: Yeah I was. I've been waiting here for an hour.


Guy: Nobody was sitting there.


Me: I only got up to pick up my order.


Guy: Whatever.


He turns around and starts shit talking about me to another patron in Tagalog. I guess he thought I didn't understand Tagalog because I spoke English fluently with no noticeable Filipino accent. Dialogue within [here] is in Tagalog but written in English due to character limits.


Guy: [Can you believe this guy? He just bullied my son.]


I lost my cool at this point.


Me: [You're gonna talk shit about me to someone else and cuss me out in Tagalog? Say it to my face bitch! What? You thought I didn't understand what you just said? Not only are you a liar but you're an asshole too.]


The other patrons paid no attention to us but his jaw dropped at my response. I was so put off at staying there to eat by this that I went up to the cashier and asked for to go bags so I could pack my food up and leave. The father and his kid were still there since they were in line waiting to order. As soon as I got up and packed my food:


Me: Next time if you're gonna lie about something don't make it so obvious.


Guy: Chill out (in a really sarcastic tone).


Me: Go fuck yourself you fucking prick. Lying ass bitch.


After that I left to go to Red Ribbon (Filipino Dessert Place) about 15 minutes out so I could cool off on the way there and pick up some desserts for me and my girlfriend before heading back to her place. AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	69.0	4.0	0.0	0.0
c1r8rg	2019-06-17 18:35:02	ddopTheGreenFox	AITA for relying on my friend so much?	"Hey, this is my first post here and wasn’t sure if fits, so apologies if this is the wrong sub.

I’ve only got 3 close friends, and any other friend are very distant and I don’t really talk to any of them. Out of my 3 close friends (2 male 1 female) only the female is really any good at listening to personal problems and talking about them. So she’s the one I go to when I’m feeling down. 

About 18 months ago I was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder and panic disorder, after trying to end my own life (reasons why don’t matter for this). This came as a shock to everyone because I had never mentioned how bad I was really feeling.  Although I’m in a stable condition now thanks to a lot of meds, the months following my attempt were definitely not easy. 

I was put in a mental hospital (can’t spell the long word that starts with p 😅) for 3 months and after I got out no one new how to act around me because they were afraid of saying something wrong. 

But once I did get out I spent as much time as possible with my female friend since she was the only person I felt I could talk to. But because I’d never really talked to anyone about anything I ended up talking to her about some kind of emotional problem 2 or 3 times a week. And she did help. But not once did I consider how she felt through all this. I only realised when one night when I was staying around her house for the night I had a pretty bad panic attack and she, although trying to hide it, was crying. I didn’t say anything about it that night and before I could say anything the following days one of her close friends (I only knew her by name) msged me telling me to leave my friend alone. This is when I really realised that all the texts, calls, conversations and panic attacks I’d had were just too much to dump on one person. 
For months I had been relying on her and her alone for emotional support, and I never realised it would effect her. And she’s one of the nicest people on earth so ofc she wouldn’t say anything to me, because she new she was my only real support. All of the texts, call, panic attacks and so on all happened over the last year or so. And I’m only realising now what I’ve done. So AITA for relying on her and only her? And AITA for not realising how she felt through all this?

Side note: sorry if things are spelt wrong and/or punctuation is bad. I’m new to this sub so if I’m in the wrong sub just let me know and I’ll remove the post 🙂

Edit: I’ve read all the comments up to this point and it’s clear I’m the asshole. Tbh I think I’ve always known, but it certainly helps to hear it from someone else. So thank you everyone who took the time to read and comment on my post. 

Some extra info which I forgot to mention:
Although I did burden them a lot and put them in a horrible position, it wasn’t all emotional drama. We spent a good portion of time together and would often go out and do things. We went to a local costa every Saturday morning and it was always a good time. Although I’m an idiot for not noticing the bad, I know we had a lot of fun together as well. 

Also, although I’m not sure what they’re actual job title is, I saw someone weekly once I got out of hospital and now monthly to talk about how I’m feeling and any emotional struggle. I relied on my friend so much instead of the pro because I simply didn’t find them very helpful. They were always kind and listened, but I never felt I was understood. Where as I felt my friend did understand a lot more. And the way she says things has really changed my perspective on certain things which I thought were set in stone.

I have already apologised to her many, many times and I’m still trying to repay her for helping me, and for what I’ve done to her. Like I said she’s the nicest person I’ve ever met so she told me I don’t need to to repay her. At the moment the debt is being paid by me always paying for coffee, but I’m trying to do a lot more than that in the future."	Asshole	0	0	49.0	18.0	0.0	0.0
c1r8ob	2019-06-17 18:34:49		AITA For being mad at my brother for crashing a motorcycle	"I'm 20 years old and live with my GF, I try to be a centrist and as logical as I can in situations as I don't like arguments at all.

&#x200B;

My 21 year old brother has always been less mature, but hey he's my brother so you learn to deal with it. He's decided to get a motorcycle after I had one for a while, but he has ADHD and has always been cocky when riding it, so I was worried about him riding it on the road. Lowe and behold, he was pulling a Wheelie, on the road, with an unlicensed motorcycle and no gear, other than a helmet and crashed. 

&#x200B;

He's in hospital as we speak, my mum is there caring with him. I would never say this to her, she is clearly very upset. I am also upset as it's my brother and he's properly in hospital, tied to a bed with blood everywhere, but he's alive and at the end of the day it's just cuts and bruises. Of course, very traumatising, but he's alive. 

&#x200B;

Now, I was on the phone to my GF and I was explaining everything to her, I mentioned ""I'm also worried he might lose his job, he's on probation and technically they can fire him without an excuse, they might be annoyed if he can't go back for a few weeks"". Keep in mind I'm still upset, but I try to be logical and I am quite angry at him (I think it's selfish of him to ride a motorcycle without gear and start pulling stunts, when he knows it'll affect his family if he comes off.)

&#x200B;

Instantly my GF goes ""Stop being so inconsiderate, he's your brother show some compassion ffs"". I was in shock, I'm clearly upset, but he's alive and I think it's important to express concern about his new job, which is a warehouse job, which requires movement and he's on probation and he has bills to pay (he lives with my parents, who are lower class and the lack of income will also affect them big time!). I only said this to my GF, not to my family and I never would have.

&#x200B;

Personally, I feel like my GF completely misread my emotions and flipped out at me at a time when it isn't supportive. She seems to assume that I didn't care about him at all. Of course I care about him, but I am also very angry at him as he brought it on himself completely, it's hard to completely sympathise with someone when they consistently (like 2 years) road a motorbike in an unsafe way and you've told them this time and time again.

&#x200B;

I feel like my GF is the arsehole for flipping out at me, even if she misread my emotions. No matter if I was coming off that way or not, I felt it was wrong to flip out like that when she couldn't be sure how I was feeling.

&#x200B;

Am I the arsehole, for being concerned he may lose his job and being mad at him, or is my GF the arsehole for assuming my emotions at a time when it didn't feel suitable."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1r4q1	2019-06-17 18:26:09	This_Aint_No_Picnic	WIBTA if I reported my new boss to HR?	"So basically, I had to go to court because of a traffic violation (no registration but insurance on a military base). I didn't realize my registration was expired, and got pulled over for a taillight. It sucks, but whatever, live and learn.

This was a couple months ago, and my court date is this month. I thought it was last week (12th), so I used up a 'personal obligation day' to go to court. It was approved, great. Get to court, am there for a couple hours before I see a small sign that says 'traffic violations, see clerk'. I went to the clerk, and she said that I still needed to see the judge, but that it was for next week (19th). Crap, well, I had some running around I needed to catch up on anyways (blood work for a doctors appointment, tire shop, meeting up with someone so I can grab straw for our garden, etc). Because I had the day off, I did my running around. 

I get to work the next day, and I tell my boss that the court day was actually for the following Wednesday, and that I would use up a vacation day now (out of POD's) to get it sorted. She said she wouldn't approve it because we've had internal compliance issues lately (work at a bank), and that she's away on a manager's meeting Monday and Tuesday, and because I would need that day off, she wouldn't approve it. I explained to her that it was a court date and that if I didn't go, I could have a warrant for my arrest. She said that she didn't care what I did on my day off, but that she wouldn't approve it, but I was arguing that it wasn't like I was going out or anything, *I was going to court*. We came to a compromise that I would have to be at work an hour and a half early *in case* there are any deficiency's I need to report on. She asked if I thought it was fair, and I said 'No, but that's fine, I need to go to court.' and she just mumbled to herself as she went back to her office. I've been wanting to quit lately, but I can't until I go to school in January, but I almost handed in my keys, I was that pissed and in disbelief.

I want to report her to HR because I shouldn't have to pretty much beg to get a day off for court. A trip somewhere, or *literally anything else*, I can get, but this is a legal issue.... WIBTA if I did?

Edit: To add a couple more details.

Edit 2: I never had a chance to pay my fine because I never got a fine. Because I was pulled over on a military base, it's an automatic court date. I've had traffic violations in the past, but I've paid them every time and on time. I also renewed the registration for two years on my truck the very next day.

Edit 3: Did not know you could ask or file to reschedule a court day. This is my first (and hopefully only) time I need to go to court. Because of this, I'm self-judging by saying ESH. She's being unreasonable, but I guess I didn't exhaust all my options (even though I didn't know they existed). I'll hold my tongue, but man, the sweet release of leaving this hell hole at the end of December is going to be *so fucking awesome*."	Asshole	0	0	386.0	35.0	0.0	0.0

c1r1xi	2019-06-17 18:19:54	measlymeadow	AITA for leaving a restaurant without eating?	"Title may sound confusing but here we go:

My husband and I were visiting a town that wasn’t the nicest but has one or two fun attractions that our town does not. Usually when visiting this town we go to our “usual” restaurant that we know is safe and has good food.

However, we decided to try a different restaurant who’s menu looked interesting and like we would enjoy it. 

When we arrived it was a shabby building that looked a little sketchy. We didn’t want to judge from the outside and went in. It was incredibly messy, the ceiling was covered in (moldy?) water stains there were bundles of cords hanging out of the wall- you get the picture.

We ordered waters and an appetizer.

15 minutes pass and we order entrees.

10 more minutes pass and we haven’t gotten anything, and the waiters start fighting with the cooks through the window. One waited runs into the back and more yelling ensues.

I generally felt very uncomfortable and not safe eating the food prepared in the kitchen.

My husband told the waiter we received a phone call and had to leave. Luckily the kitchen hadn’t even started ANY of our food yet.

We left and ate at the other safe restaurant.

Tl;dr: AITA for ordering food and then leaving the restaurant before it was made because the conditions made me feel unsafe?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	100.0	14.0	0.0	0.0
c1r10h	2019-06-17 18:17:57		WIBTA for reporting my tutor to the IRA?	"So just to clarify I don't live in America and I wouldn't be reporting them to the IRA but it would be the equivalent agency in my country. I've changed countries for sake of anonymity. I've also left out other details for the same reasons since I believe this tutor is pretty active on reddit.

So I'm studying an unnamed degree and am finishing up this year. The year is divided into two semesters and we only have semester (or half year) courses. Of the 5 or so courses I'm finishing up now during exam times, one of them was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to study in my life. It would've been on par with other difficult courses in my degree if it wasn't for the lecturer who prides himself on how many people he can get to fail. He's incredibly smart and knows the content backwards and uses that to test us in the hardest possible way.

As a result this tutor saw an opportunity to host extra lessons, which naturally came at a fee. Assuming the current exchange rate and a ratio of minimum wage between my country and America to be 1:3 he was making somewhere between $345 and $1035 for 5 hours at a rate of $34.50 per student per session as he would get between 10 and 30 students (but often closer to 30). Sometimes these sessions would go the whole day in which case the price would increase to $45 per student per session (Him taking home between $450 and $1350 for those too lazy to do the math). For the first half of the year he would have multiple sessions a week, all with sparkling attendance. Point being that 1) he was definitely overcharging and 2) he was earning much more than the tax threshold in my country.

Now he only accepted cash and once when someone asked him if they could transfer electronically he refused saying he doesn't want the IRA all up in his business and that this student must pay him double next time in cash (for both the current session and the next one). Now since he evidently doesn't pay tax on this massive income I could report him for it.

Reasons I think I am TA:
1: I am much more motivated by the reward I will get from the IRA than I am by doing what's right.
2: I am also partially vindictive since he knows so much about a course while I know so little and he charged students so much.

Reasons I might not be TA:
1: It's the right thing to do, right?

So as you can see, I'm a little confused here and I could really use an outsiders perspective. So WIBTA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1r0b4	2019-06-17 18:16:22	CrimsonPride18	AITA for throwing away GF's Christmas gift?	"NOTE: Not me, but one of my best friends who doesn't have Reddit. Posting with his approval.

My friend (23M, call him ""Mark"") has been dating his girlfriend (23F, ""Renee"") for just over 4 years now. Mark is a HUGE New Orleans sports fan, in particular the Pelicans. Renee is well aware of this.

A few years ago, Renee bought Mark an Anthony Davis (the best player on the team and one of the best in the NBA) Pelicans tshirt for Christmas. Mark loved it and wore it often, but it is still in good condition today.

6 months ago during the NBA season, Anthony Davis demanded a trade away from New Orleans. Mark was understandably upset, and he stopped wearing the shirt at that point. This weekend it was announced that Davis has been traded to the Lakers.

In Mark's mind, Davis is dead to him. He would never wear the shirt again, even just to sleep, so he threw the shirt away. Renee found the shirt in their garbage, and was upset because she gave it to him as a gift. Mark compared it to a bluetooth speaker that broke, he wouldn't keep it around even though it was a gift because it is unusable.

Mark acknowledges that he maybe should have donated the shirt instead of throwing it away, but is he TA for getting rid of it? I can confirm that he will never wear it again, even to sleep in.

c1r04i	2019-06-17 18:15:57	ICANELECTRIC	AITA for being mad about a shared father's day post	"A bit of background. I am a father and a step dad. Right now my step daughter is about 3.5 and my son is less than 1 year old. I was in a relationship with my girlfriend before my stepdaughters first birthday.  When my girlfriend and I started dating her daughters  father was not in the picture. He would come up every couple of months to drop off child support money, usually less than 250 USD for a month but did not hold or interact with his daughter in any way. When my girlfriend got pregnant I told my girlfriend I wanted to be my stepdaughters father so that she did not feel left out when our son came.

 Over the past few months we have been having some relationship issues. Despite that fact I still make time for both of the kids and she still has a credit card in her name that I pay so she can take care of both of the kids. We are for all intensive purposes separated, though we are trying to see if we can work things out. 

On father's day she gave me a card and a few things from both kids, though everything from my stepdaughter had my first name not ""dad"", which I do understand as our future is not certain. At the end of the day she made this post on facebook (photos not included) :

""Screaming Happy Father's Day to each of the men who blessed me with such beautiful children! To the 2 men who go above and beyond to support their kids, to the 2 hardworking men who actually like each other and choose to become friends so we can all work together! Thats what its all about! Our kids are so blessed to have these 2!"" 

Followed by some emojis and hashtags. 

I am furious that she made it out like he has been just as good of  a father as me to our kids. I gave her my truck and drove her 25 year old car with no AC to my job at a shipyard for two years before my son was even born because her car was not safe for our daughter. I gave her a credit card in her name so that she could get the kids anything they need. I paid for our stepdaughters first three birthdays, entirely footed the bill while my stepdaughters father did not even offer to help. I pay for all of the christmas stuff. I taught her how to walk and talk while he was nowhere to be seen. Now that we have some issues she talks about him like he is some saint.  He has a built racing motorcycle, a new truck every month, and frequently shows up to the house with designer clothing, yet cannot afford more than 250 in child support, which by the way goes straight into her collage account. Her mom and I have paid for every ounce of her living expenses her entire life.  

AITA for being pissed that she made it seem like we are equal as fathers?
 
Update for clarification: The money stuff was more of a side note, even though it does make me mad. The main point is he has never been around. When I say i thought her how to walk while he was no where to be seen, I mean he did not see her one time in 8 months. Didnt call didnt drop in. Nothing. He has not seen his daughter more than 25 times in 3.5 years. Not one time did he take her for the weekend, or even out to do something. He has not been in her life in a meaningful at all. When he does come my significant other goes to lunch with him with out my stepdaughter."	Asshole	0	0	101.0	16.0	0.0	0.0

No call back, and I didn't continue to attempt to call him. I assumed he was out with my step-siblings and half siblings. 

&#x200B;

Some relevant background info- Dad is recently remarried (3rd time) and lives 90 minutes north of us. We just drove to his house last weekend for a BBQ for his stepson's birthday (we skipped my bday though?) but no mention of Father's Day was made. It was a fun bbq and we all hung out for the whole afternoon (then drove 90 minutes home). We were all closer before, but ever since he moved 75 miles away, it's much harder to connect.

Also, my stepdad (of 20+ years), who lives 10 minutes from me- has stage 3 lung cancer. He's doing really well, and finishes his first round of chemo and radiation today! We spent the afternoon at my mom's house yesterday to see my stepdad and celebrate this/Father's Day.

Here's the context of this situation: I've been active and healthy for 90% of my life. But about four years ago I gained approx. 60 lbs after starting medication and developing a binge eating disorder after personal issues. I am currently overweight. I've been making strides in my weight loss journey this year and am happy to say I've lost fifteen pounds so far, but I'm still overweight and you can look at me and recognize that. 

My friend is 5'4 and 115 lbs soaking wet. She's thin. There's no other way to flip that.

Here's the issue: My friend used to have a habit of putting on an outfit and asking me ""Does this make me look fat?"" I used to just answer no and move on, though it made me uncomfortable. Finally, I told her to stop asking me that because it makes me uncomfortable and ask our other roommate who's in a similar weight range to her. I told her it makes me uncomfortable because she is clearly not overweight in the slightest and if she thinks she is, then what does that say about me, an actual fat girl. Lmao. I told her she could always ask me if something was ""flattering.""

She understood and hugged me and apologized. But then not two weeks later she walks up to me in the bathroom in a cute outfit and asks again, ""Do I look fat in this?"". I just looked at her and answered, ""Yup.""

After the event, we came back to find that my car was being issued a ticket. Apparently we missed a sign that said the metered parking was reserved for residents on the street after 6 PM, and I was issued a pricey ticket.

Context: I’m a 20 something female working in a biotech. I have two cats who are of senior age and I’ve had them for 10 + years. My mom passed away when I was in my teens so these cats are my babies and my full responsibility (with some help from my bf).

Appt is for 2pm as that’s all that was available. Boyfriend was out of town so I didn’t have back up help. Boss was out of town so I communicated via email. I could’ve gone to work in the morning and then left for the appt but I was holding onto hope that a morning appt would be cancelled and we could slide in. My boss is exceedingly nice and anytime I’ve ever had any reason to miss work, she’s been very understanding. In the last year, I’ve missed 1.5 days due to illness and a couple random mornings or afternoons due to scheduled appointments. The rest of my time off has been scheduled vacations. I could’ve easily said I have an afternoon appt and need to leave early but I decided to just take the day and use pto. I told her I had a family emergency. AITA for not saying that it was my cat and not a human? She probably assumes I mean human. She knows my cat has had health issues (I missed one afternoon because of a vet appointment) but doesn’t know much else.

c1qwdw	2019-06-17 18:07:23	not_cinderella	AITA for not moving my stuff?	"So I’m in university and I’m a type A personality person for sure, which partially means I’m always early or at the very least on time for class on the dot. 

A lot of my classes take place in large lecture halls with chairs and tables that fold up and down as needed. Once a persons situated in a seat, it’s kind of difficult to get past them. Not impossible but hard. 

Anyways a lot of people are late for my classes and it really annoys me, especially when they try to push past me to get to a seat (I always sit on the aisle because I have a medical condition which requires me to have to go to the bathroom a lot). 

AITA for never putting my table down and moving my stuff to make it easier for them to get past? I always show how annoyed I am when they walk in late and putting my table down means I have to pause on taking notes and listening to what the professor says. Part of me feels justified in just making them get by as they can and the other part of me feels like a jerk. 

For info - I do put my table down if people come in and they’re not late. But these people coming in late are 10, 20, 30 + minutes late.

EDIT: I guess I don’t understand why I have to put my table and pause on taking notes for them to get by when they’re late. Like I’m missing out on some of my learning?"	Asshole	0	0	370.0	331.0	0.0	0.0

We'll call them F and Z. All 3 of us moved in together and we were fine for awhile. Long story short F and I started getting tired of Zs shit. Always having friends over making a mess and not cleaning up. I cant say I'm not to blame for messes too of my cat but mostly my mess was in my room. 

We were all relatively fine when Z moved out a month before the lease was up. Which was fine they paid last months rent and cleaned up their room.
What we didnt realize is when it finally came down to cleaning the whole house. Z had still left a good amount of their stuff their and still had their share of messes to clean up. For 2 weeks before we had to be out I kept texting Z to come pick up their stuff and maybe possibly help clean. That never happened. So we did it ourselves.

A month passes and we get the bill for the damages to the place. We were expecting that. So me and F talk about the split and text Z and told them what they owed. They said they didnt need to pay it since they did no damage and it was all our cats. I'm sorry but a cat cant punch a hole in the door of your room and leave a bike behind.

So they threw a fit at F and Z and blocked us. So I messaged their S/O to talk them and they convinced Z to pay us . But only to my S/O. 

Before me and f knew Z was gonna give us the money we talked to the renters and had to put a note on their record they they weren't reliable and put us on a payment plan so we could pay it off. It would take 2 months. Z also has us blocked from messaging them and is harassing my S/O about me and F.

But now that's happening Z cant rent a new place with this place being paid off. I really want him to suffer abit because of it. But if I do... AITA?

Side note: Z is sort of an ass who can take advantage of people and do bad things without consequences - I've forgiven Z for a lot of shit they've done. But now I want them to know they cant get away with everything."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

So 4 years ago I met a girl at uni that was really into tattoos. I was never really friends with her, we were just colleagues,  but since I had an interest in tattoos as well (even tho I don't have any), I talked to her about them and asked about a specific tattoo she had: a simple sun and moon, each one below her collarbones. I had thought about doing one for some time, and always wanted a sun/moon themed one, simple and small, and either on the collarbone area or on the back of the neck, so I completely fell in love with hers. She said it was her design, and said she never saw anyone with a tattoo like hers. Hearing that, I try to get the desire to have that tattoo out of my mind.  


Fast forward 2 years. I leave that uni to move to a different one, and I still have that tattoo on my mind. However, I felt like I'd be stealing something, even if it was just a minimalistic sun and moon. I tried to look for other designs that would maybe make me forget that one, but no luck. I just tried to put it out of my mind, and told myself that maybe I should just forget about getting a tattoo. Over the years I still had some thoughts, but always oppressed them.   


Fast forward to today, I saw a girl in the mall with a very similar tattoo - minimalistic sun and moon, collarbone area. All my feelings came back, and seeing that kind of tattoo on another person, I just fell in love with it again.

"A little background: Every year, myself and some good friends (who don't see each other often) get together for a weekend away from work, partners, and for some of us, kids. We all drink and catch up and have a relaxing time. Usually it's the only time the whole year we see each other.

The friend in question (who I've known my whole life) had a baby a few months ago. This year, she wants to bring the baby up with her (the baby is about 8 months old). Now, she's not breastfeeding, and she has her husband to take care of the baby, so it's not like she's abandoning him. My question is AITA for not wanting her to bring the baby, and is there any way I can suggest that to her without being an asshole? For the record, I don't have kids, so maybe I just don't get it, but it feels like it'll upend the whole weekend since none of us will actually be able to relax because THERE'S A CRYING BABY, duh!

c1qpz7	2019-06-17 17:53:43	legendsofsara	AITA for asking sister-in-law if she can take me and my Dad to the airport?	"My half brother is 10 years older than me and he got married to my sister-in-law. She has never liked my mother, my brother's stepmom. I think this might be due to the strained relationship my brother and my mom had when he was a teenager. Things have improved between them, but things have always been cold between her and my mom. My mom often stresses about her relationship with them because she does try and make an effort to be nice to her. 

My sister-in-law has always been a bit controlling. She actually tried to turn my aunt, my mom sister against my mom and has done similar things in the past with me and other family members. I only ever saw it when I stayed with them a couple years ago to help out when my nephew, they're first born, was a baby. She would get mad at me, a teenager at the time, if I ate some of their food or, so I just bought whatever food I would need and generally took care of my self. 

So my brother and sister-in-law had a new baby a few months ago and so we planned to go visit. The issue has recently occurred when I asked my sister-in-law if she could to drive my father and myself back to the airport my mother and sisters are planning to leave early in case things get too tense or if my sister who has medical issues needs to go home. I get along pretty well with my sister-in-law and my Dad adores my brother and his grandkids so it's not an issue for us to be visiting.

I thought that my dad would be driving out with his own car, but he changed his mind and wanted to fly with me. So I texted my sister-in-law to inform her of this and she was upset. She said “ugh, okay fine I'll get a babysitter for the baby,” who would have a hard time traveling. 

I told my mom if this and she is worried that this will cause my sister-in-law to be bitter the whole time we are there. My Dad has talked to my brother and they're trying to work something out, but it's hard because she is listening in the whole time and my dad isn't able to honestly talk with my brother and ask him how my sister-in-law feels about the whole thing.

At this point I am ready to cut ties as much as it pains me. I’m mad because they never visit or make an effort to have a relationship with my sisters and I and because my sister won't be able to travel very much longer as her health deteriorates and I want my brother to be able to spend time with her. This relationship is feeling very much one-sided and I'm not sure if I should go and visit them or change my travel plans. 

Tldr: Strained relationship between my mother and sister-in-law comes to a head when I asked her if she could drive me and my father to the airport, and she gets mad, acting like it's the worst thing in the world. So I wonder if visiting them at all is a good idea?

"This is on a throwaway account because I dont want it to be attached to my real account. I’ll try and keep this as short and sweet as possible. In May of 2018, my sister and I found out that my dad was cheating on my mom and they were in a marriage for almost 20 years. This was an elaborate situation of cheating. We both decided to tell my mom about it after a lot of thinking. This resulted in my mom wanting a divorce from my dad and they are currently in the last stages of divorce right now. 
Ever since it happened, my dad has been severely unstable. He has tried numerous times to get back together with my mom, and she does not want to be with him again. He has been texting my sister and I almost everyday trying to talk to us. Neither of us want to talk to him and this was a decision we made on our own. I feel extremely bad about it though because my dad lives alone now and essentially has been exiled from the family and no one wants anything to do with him. He has told me multiple times how he does not want to live anymore and this causes on a huge burden on my mind. I know he is probably trying to manipulate me but still I have no idea what to do in this situation. I do not want to talk to him, and I dont want to open up a can of worms by talking to him. I tried blocking him but he always tries to text me from different numbers so it is basically impossible to stop getting messages from him.

c1qn20	2019-06-17 17:46:55	merkis	AITA for not liking wife spending her allowance on her parents?	"My wife and I manage our finances jointly. (combine all income and budget together) Thanks to /r/personalfinance, I firmly believe that every dollar I earn/spend has to have a purpose, no matter how small the amount. I also believe that if we were to help either of our parents, it should be not only mutually agreed, but also budgeted for. The emphasis here is that I believe helping either of the parents shouldn't be from just their biological child, but rather from both of us, since we're a couple that manages money jointly.

To allow some flexibility on personal expenses, we give ourselves a fixed “allowance”. Beer night out, football tickets, etc. come out from here. She doesn’t have as many hobbies as I, but she uses it for girl’s night out or non-essential expensive shopping. For the most part she is not a big spender in the first place so often has money leftover.

I noticed that she uses her allowance for her parents. While traveling to Europe, we wanted to bring back some souvenirs for the family. We agreed to cap the gift budget at $50 on each of our parents. After buying gifts that total up to $50, she wanted to buy more stuff for her dad, and said ""I'll just pay for it with my own allowance."" It's her money, so I couldn't say anything, but it didn't feel that great, for reasons I still can't exactly articulate. I just remember thinking “why the hell did we agree to cap it at $50 then?”

Not too long ago, I learned that she's paying for her parents' cell phone bill with her allowance. She's been on their family plan, and her portion of the bill is obviously budgeted for. I learned that she's been paying the rest of the bill out of her pocket. Another time, her dad was complaining about how icloud storage is not enough. She signed him up for the upgraded storage, and I saw her entering her personal card instead of asking for his. I mean, it's like $1/month so not a big deal, but I guess it irritated me a little just based on principle.

It's not like I don't want to spend money on her parents. In fact, when we eat out with her parents, we pay 95%+ of the time. He's yet to pay for the full check once in my 4-year marriage. Neither my nor her parents are that well off, so we try to open our wallet as much as we can. It often causes our food budget to go over, but we sacrifice elsewhere to make up for it. But paying for meals comes out from our joint budget and WE are treating them.

To summarize why I don’t like her allowance being spent on her parents:

* Instead of “hey, we decided to pay for your cell phone bill to help you out”, she’s been paying on her own without telling me.
* This isn’t what allowances were intended to be. It’s so that within a limit, we can freely enjoy/buy things we want.

Her thought is that it's her money to spend freely, and I should keep my nose out of her business. I'm totally open to changing my view if I'm being too controlling. Am I being the ass hole here? Thanks for any input!!

c1qlu7	2019-06-17 17:44:04	throwaway1937391op	AITA for putting in a formal complaint against my ex's gf at her place of work?	"I dated B in uni over 2 years ago. We were toxic together. There was cheating, lying, gaslighting, blow out fights, etc.

I started dating my SO the summer after B and I broke up, and he eventually met his gf T.

SO and I decided to go camping last minute. The majority of places were already booked. We found a campground about 40 minutes outside of B's hometown (HT). It was beautiful, so we booked it.

We pull up to the gate and, to our surprise, T is working. I had no idea T worked there. I thought 40 minutes away was a good distance from HT.

T and I have never officially met, but recognize each other right away. SO and I are polite. She's rude with us, but we keep going. SO and I set up and have a great time.

We're quiet, clean and respectful; basically hang around a fire for most of it. Then T starts to drive by our camp, just staring at us.  Being stared at by your ex's gf when you're two days without a shower is not pleasant.

Weird, but fine. We pack up and leave. We stop in HT for gas, I check her social media. I'm aware of how petty she can be, and her social media often comes up in my suggestions, so not exactly hard to find.

Publically, T had posted saying (paraphrased) yeah maybe one time she sat next to me at uni, but she didn't recognize me because I was uglier in person. But at least she didn't travel to HT to stalk her boyfriend and harass her at her work for two days. With a new boyfriend! ""Yikes!""

This made me extremely angry. If she had noticed us in HT and tweeted about it, fine. But she used info she had as an employee of a camp we paid to stay at. The post was obvious about who and where, altho she didn't use names.

I hadn't let any mutuals know I was there because I didn't want them to know. And this girl goes and publically shares where we are and for how long. She implies I not only knew they were in HT but also that she worked there. She commented on bringing ""a new bf"", implying I was a slut like B liked to call me. (SO and I have actually been together longer than T and B).

That was it for me. I sent in a formal complaint to her employer, gave her a horrific review on a survey about our stay, citing the unpleasant greeting, her driving by our campsite, and the tweet.

To let her know I'd seen it, I posted an Insta story that said ""when his gf so insecure she posting about you two years after the break up"". I took it down after our mutuals saw. I know it was passed on to her because her accounts are now locked, but I have a screenshots to back up the complaint.

On one hand, I get it. The breakup was messy and to her, I probably seemed like the crazy toxic one. My ex has never taken responsibility for his cheating, etc. If I were her, I wouldn't want to see me around either.

On the other hand, I don't think I should avoid the northern part of the state forever. It's been two years since I've been anywhere near HT and I didn't contact B or anyone he knew!

So I go to coldstone, and they do not have an ice cream cake, so I them go to dairy queen, and they only have kid's birthday cakes left, so I got a ""treatza pizza"" which I thought would suffice, but ended up costing much less. I texted my sister to let her know and asked her if she would like me to pay for some of the pizza to even everything out. She calls me about 10 minutes later and yells at me asking why I didn't just get the kids cake, and why I didn't get the coldstone cake (already told her why in a text). 

I told her I'd figure it out and get a kids cake, and hung up on her. She texted me a couple times telling me not to worry about it, and to just being what I had, but I was not having it and told her I'd be late for dinner, as I had to go to another dairy queen to look for another cake (which I found and bought).

c1qkf1	2019-06-17 17:40:54	stevoox3	AITA for not wanting to donate for an old friend's gofundme page?	"So a little back story:

I've known this girl (we'll call her Alex) since probably 2013 and as time progressed we got closer but not to the point where I would trust her with my life. It was really a one way friendship because I would just be there and just listen to her rant about her relationship problems and blah blah blah. The thing is I didn't really mind having the one way friendship but I was slowly backing off when I realized I was wasting my time when I would sit there listening to her and give her advice on how she should handle things and just watch her do the complete opposite of the advice I gave her.  Then, some drama happened roughly in beginning of 2017 between Alex and another close friend of mine and eventually it just lead to me drawing the line because of how toxic she is. So I decided to not engage in any conversation between her and I and so in between from the beginning of 2017 to now Alex and I would talk but not as much as we use to before.

&#x200B;

So, just a couple of days ago her father past away due to some type of work accident and the way I found out was I saw that most of my friends we're posting gofundme links, but she still hasn't sent me anything about that. So I told my parents about it and they felt bad about it (mom's really religious, dad goes with what moms says to make her happy) and they decided to be generous enough to cover the cost of the funeral. Which is roughly the amount she had for her gofundme, $25,000. We were going to donate anonymously and tell no one we donated it because we like to keep our lives private. Then fast forward to today and I received a text from her and it was just a link to her gofundme. Nothing else. I understand she still mourning about her father but I don't know if I'm overreacting or something because I think it would've been appropriate of her to mention something like ""Hey I know we haven't talk in a minute, but can you help with the funeral for my dad, any type of donation is welcomed.""  But she never sent anything like that. Then, when I read the link she sent, I expressed my condolences to her and her family. Keep in mind we're texting over snapchat and so after I express my condolences I clicked on her story and I went through a bunch of posts where it seems like she intentionally wants you to feel bad for her. Like one of her story captions was ""Never thought I would have to decide what clothes I should wear for my Dad's funeral..."" and right after that story was a link to her gofundme and cash app (gofundme takes a percentage of what's donated) and to me that isn't quite right. 

&#x200B;

I then told my parents about what's going on and I told them not to donate the money to her anymore. My reason is because she never include that extra message with the link and because she's basically making you feel sorry for her on her snapchat and making you feel obligated to donate. So was I the asshole even though she never knew what was going on? and if so, is there any feedback on how I could of done this better?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	32.0	22.0	0.0	0.0
c1qjxg	2019-06-17 17:39:56	lablah1111	AITA for calling the cops on my friend who forced her dogs on a vegan diet?	"With all jokes aside, I am a vegan. Not by choice though. I have some digestion issues where my body can't process most food correctly. I must have a strict diet and the vegan is a good way to actually eat food without getting nutritions through a tube. 

Most of the vegan stereotypes ain't true. I and most of my friends don't harass people for their choices on what they eat. Your life, your body. Do whatever. Just please be respectful to the animals etc. Most...some of us won't have a meltdown if there a piece of cheese on my food.

With all that said, I do have a few friends who are those hardcore stereotype vegans who would walk into restaurants yelling meat is murder or would block as well lecture people why they're destroying the world and animals are friends while people are trying to get burgers for a 4th of July party. 

I and my friend in question had heated debates to the point we both turn red everytime on what to feed our pets. We both have two dogs. I feed my dogs what is recommended by the veterinarian. I completely understand they have different needs than people. My friend the other hand, feeds them a vegan diet as she believes it can be good for them as well. 

Every time we hang out, her dogs look so sickly. They never have the energy to play even though they both are about a year old. Give or take. For the last three months, they got worse. They walk around looking confused, lost interest in everything and lost so much weight. Last week I called SPCA and law enforcement because the dog would not move even if you push them. The cops came by and took the dogs away. 

The group of friends is split down the middle of what I did. Some say we waited too long and others are saying I'm an asshole. I do feel bad for my friend. Disregard the diet, she loves those dogs and did care for their wellbeing. She hasn't stop crying or said a word to me. I felt maybe I could've done something different before I called the cops. Maybe I could've taken the dogs myself and/or have her talk to medical professionals about dog's health needs but I was so angry when I last saw the dogs I just had too. Now I feel so guilty. AITA?

c1qibs	2019-06-17 17:36:26	ShulginsExperience	AITA for not letting my brother (15) into the basement where I (20) smoke weed. More details below.	So I never post on reddit so this is kind of weird, but me and my brother have a weird relationship we used to be super close when we were children but our parent splitting up when I was 13 and he was 8 really set us back.  Since then I’ve lived over my grandparents and he’s split time between my parents houses.  I’ve always been a smarter kid than my brother and he’s bigger so he often struggles to make friends and excel in school because he thinks he’s always been in my shadow.  I’ve always smoked weed and my brother as I found out just started too as-well which was around the same time as me  so I can’t really say anything, but the reason I’m not allowing in the basement is because he keeps smoking my weed even after countless times of me asking him just to ask me if he wants to take a hit or something. I occasionally smoke with him, but the reason I feel like I’m an asshole is because I really looks up to me and the only time we really bond now is when we’re smoking weed or he’s downstairs smoking my weed and I feel like I’m putting him on an island by not allowing him down there.  I feel weird putting this on reddit I’m not that type of person, but I and my parent’s relationship Isn’t the best so I have no one else I feel comfortable talking to this about.  Thanks for any of the small answers I received in the effort to help me.  Im also a reddit noob so sorry if the grammar or format is all messed up.	Not the A-hole	0	0	146.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

c1qi78	2019-06-17 17:36:07		WIBTA for reporting my coworker?	"Hello! Obligatory this is a throwaway account as I am unsure if this coworker is reddit savvy. 

TLDR; Coworker I don't know well asks me out 2x via work app despite me having a fiance. Supervisor says if he contacts me again we go to the manager. WIBTA for reporting him again since he has, or am I overreacting?

&#x200B;

I'll start this off by saying that  I (23F) am a very friendly person, and have always been well-liked by my peers and coworkers. I'm the first choice when training new hires or when someone needs help. I'm also a high-functioning Aspie (no one knows or suspects this in my career) and most of my ""quirks"" are masked by my charisma and attractiveness. Because of this, I have difficulty discerning what someones intentions are if I do not know them personally, and this combined with my personality and ""hot bod"" (not my words) occasionally make men think I am ""flirting"" with them and I am typically none the wiser until they actually ask me out. 

&#x200B;

I work a full-time position at a facility with indoor and outdoor workers. I work indoors, and the coworker in question (who I'll call Dave) is an outdoor worker. Since I am not outside often, I do not have much interaction with him or the other outdoor workers. Just like my other coworkers though, I joke around with him and think nothing of it. A week ago, he messaged me on our work app (for work only!) and asked if I wanted to see his band perform at a venue a considerable distance away. He did this several hours after a social event at work (was really fun, I brought my *fiance*, and all my coworkers saw and met him, except for Dave who did not attend). I said no. A couple days later, he mentions that a Krispy Kreme has finally opened up, and mentions that it's close to where I live. 

&#x200B;

He's clearly not getting the hint, so I try to let him down easy, and say ""Oh my boyfriend and I are Krispy Kreme fiends! That's great news!"" He does not take this well, and says ""Thanks for sharing, way to make a guy feel special."" and avoids me entirely at work the next day. I did not reply, and am uncomfortable with this behavior. I tell my supervisor about the situation and she is pissed. I don't think it's too serious just yet so we compromise that if he messages me again then I tell her, and she goes to the manager. Well he has. Three days ago he sends a message asking ""this is blueberrytortilla, right?"" and then the next day ""I'm just asking because there's like 2 other blueberrytortilla's that work here"". WIBTA if I reported him again? I haven't responded and am just kinda waiting it out rn as these messages aren't asking me out again, but the unprofessionalism and inappropriate nature of asking me out via work app, and the fact that he's still avoiding me while messaging me just makes me uncomfortable.

c1qi3x	2019-06-17 17:35:54	BayouCitySaint	AITA: Upset about Father's Day night	"My wife and I have 4 kids under the age of 8, and a generally healthy marriage. She bought me a few great gifts for Father's Day, and helped the kids bake a pie and make cards. I grilled, watched baseball, and spent time with my family. All in all, a pretty good day.

The problem came at night when the kids went to bed. I was downstairs cleaning up the grill stuff and the kitchen. I sat down for a few minutes on the couch, thinking my wife would come downstairs like usual once the kids are down. Then we'd eventually make our way upstairs. This is what happens most nights.

I go upstairs eventually and find her watching Game of Thrones in our bedroom. She's a few seasons ahead of me, so we don't/can't watch it together. She is WAY more into the show than I am, and started skipping ahead when I didn't want to watch it until 2 AM every night. This has been a minor problem for us over the last few weeks.

I'm pretty upset that she chose to sneak away and watch GoT instead of coming to find me at bedtime on Father's Day. She didn't communicate anything - not that she wanted to watch an episode, not that she was ready for bedtime, nothing. She just started watching without saying anything and figured I'd come to bed eventually. 

If there's one night out of the year to put away the TV show, I think this was it. I don't care how into a video game I am, I'd never sneak away at bedtime on Mother's Day to play it. I'm already feeling like I'm taking a backseat to her GoT addiction, and this just made it worse on a whole new level.

c1qi3h	2019-06-17 17:35:52	HonestHalf5	AITA for returning a dog because she isn't cuddly?	"We adopted a dog two weeks ago, she was only 20wk old and is a Cairn terrier mix. Training so far has been going well, she's already starting to like her crate and messes outside 90% of the time. She's lovely with our son, maybe a little too rambunctious (won't stop chasing, licking, etc unless we separate them). This is all good and dandy but she isn't cuddly at all. She cries when held, doesn't like pets, and generally is antisocial.

This isn't our first dog. We had a Yorkie and a Norwich before this one and they were so cuddly, they just would beg for pets and cuddles and would like nothing more than lay beside you. This new dog is just a completely different personality, not what we were lead to believe (we were told she's cuddly).

Would I be the asshole for returning her to the kennel we got her from? We paid a $500 adoption fee and after the fact got her another round of vaccinations and deworming. We paid the $500 but put another $300 or so into her. Even if we didn't get our money back, the issue isn't the money, it's the dog's personality."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1qfxv	2019-06-17 17:31:08	AlarmingPin	AITA with regards to suits for my wedding?	"I'm due to get married soon and started looking at suits the weekend just past, my bride to be and I found the best possible suit for our color scheme too. We looked at the price and was informed due to my field of work I can receive 20% discount of the total cost, bringing the total from $300 to $240, bearing in mind this is a 3 piece suit from a reputable suit retailer too and the quality is very good.

&#x200B;

I have one best man and 4 groomsmen, upon sharing the link for the suit into the group chat one groomsman noticed you can hire suits and said it'd be a cheaper alternative. I looked into hiring and it turns out the suit I'd like for us to all wear isn't covered in the hire scheme and that the closest color was too bright. I hosted a poll with buy / hire and the results were 5 for buying their own suits and 1 for hire which was the groomsman who initially mentioned hiring in the first place.

&#x200B;

Here's where the issue begins... said groomsman is extremely tight with his finances, he's had the comfortable life of mum and dad paying for most things for example... He went to university and his parents paid for his student accommodation for 3 years, they bought him a top line macbook for uni too. He even pesters people for things like lending them $2 three weeks a go or if he bought them a drink he'll pester relentlessly until he has the money back, he's recently traveled to a few countries in Europe too and when it comes to going out drinking he'll take a fair amount out with him too, my issue is that he also boasts about how much he's got saved which is around $3,000 and goes on about how hard he works etc, to my knowledge he only works weekends. Another gripe is he claims he'll never wear this suit again so to him it seems like an unnecessary expense... Even though it's for MY wedding. My other issue is his brother is my best man and works a lot more than him has minimal savings, is paying for uni himself and has a lot more outgoings than said groomsman and said he wants to buy his own suit!?

&#x200B;

Bottom line was also mentioned that if he cant buy he'll go against me and hire a different color suit and I point blank refused and informed him if he did, he'd no longer be a groomsman because the photos wouldn't look right.

c1qftx	2019-06-17 17:30:57	VastStatement4	AITA for not eating anything in a 3 course meal?	"so i work for a really small IT firm in Canada, and recently we finally finished a big project so our upper management (who are based in another city) came to town and took our entire office (only 6 staff members) out to dinner, in a fancy restaurant about 2 miles out of town. The Menu there was already pre decided for everyone. The menu was only revealed to us about 2 hours before we were supposed to arrive so I didn't have chance to see it, but lets just say management had splashed the fuck out on this.

but I am a picky eater, like seriously. I only eat about 10-15 foods. and I rotate them within my diet, and cook for myself.

I pulled my boss aside (the one who runs our office) and explained that I would not eat any of the food selected and if I could just order off the regular menu this restaurant has (where I would've been able to get 2 but not 3 courses that I'd eat) he said no and that ""I'll eat what I'm given if I want to show respect""

so anyway, the starter came and it was **Broccoli soup**, I don't like broccoli soup so I just ate one of the slices of bread that came on the side of the dish.

The Main Course was **Lobster fried rice**, I absolutely despise lobster so I didn't touch a single thing on this plate and just sat there sort of staring at it, while drinking my water (which I had ordered to not drink the expensive $200 bottle of wine which i didn't like)

at this point I could see my boss might be slightly frustrated with me so I kept my conversation down to a bare minimum.

When dessert came it was just lots of fruit and a couple bowls of things to dip in (think strawberries and cream) I don't eat fruit so I too had none of this.

When it was time to say goodbye the 2 men from management shook my hand but didn't speak a word to me like they had to everyone else, and my boss simply didn't say a word to me. but I received a text a few hours after saying ""we'll talk next time you're in the office"" (I'm on vacation for 4 days now)

so AITA reddit?

Friend turning 18 soon will be Tes and other girl friend will be Jane 

So a bit of backstory:
my old friend group had me, Tes and Jane and then 4 guys which are all awesome. I dated one of them for about 3 months. We broke it off because I found out some shit that’s a whole other story. The whole group eventually drifted away from each other. 

Now Tes’ birthday is in 4 days. I’ve been extremely good friends with her since kindergarten but we now go to different schools and we haven’t talked much lately. We still have that relationship that whenever we do hangout we have a bunch! Of fun and we both always love it. 

We also live about 100 meters from each other.

For her birthday I was planning on either inviting her to Spain or Greece for a week. Just the two of us to catch up and have some fun together. 

The thing is I was at a party last Fridays with Jane. Jane and Tes’ friendship ended really badly and there was a lot of fighting going on 
So I learned from Jane that Tes’ was throwing a birthday party and was inviting 60 people. I had no idea about this and was never invited. 

Tes’ has cried countless times on my shoulders and I’ve been invited to her family birthday and then she invites my ex, but not me. Here 18 is a really special birthday because you’re finally an adult. I was really looking forward to spending this day with her. 

I just really don’t feel like spending ANY amount of money on her 

TLDR: my best friend held a birthday party, didn’t invite me but invited my ex, I haven’t bought a gift and now I don’t really want to

So the Night before church my mom explained that my friends mom had been very sick, and wanted me to be careful with them as to not get sick.

Sunday morning roles around and I'm at church, I see my friends and asked my friend Ashley (not real name) if she was sick/ feeling sick, she said no but I explained I still wanted to be careful, she understood, we hang out for a bit and Ashley's sister starts saying she thinks she running a fever, and I kept that in mind.  
Our church does this thing before a song starts you can greet one-another. I go up to Ashley's sister, Emma, we'll call her tries to reach for a hand shake, but I smile, gesture no and say ""no thank you"" and she immediately goes from happy to sad. I didn't notice at the time but kinda had a gut feeling something was off, Ashley taps my should and I turn to her.

""Hey, Emma said she feels sad that you didn't shake her hand and thinks you don't like her and think she's sick,"" 

I frowned and nodded, I would have talked to her right then but a song was playing and I didn't wanna be yelling a personal apology in the middle of church.

Emma heads to the bathroom and I decide to follow her as I felt truly guilty.  
I enter the bathroom and say ""Hey, Emma I'm really sorry for not shaking your hand, it's just you said you felt like you were running a fever and I wanted to be cautious,"" and this part I'm about to tell is important to why I didn't want to shake her hand, ""It's just my sister used to have cancer and still has a weaker immune system and it could really hurt her if she got sick, I really hope you understand and forgive me.""

c1q9bu	2019-06-17 17:16:58		WIBTA for not apologizing to my FSIL because I got upset about the wedding dress she bought?	"So basically, I am a huge advocate for the body positivity movement. This isn’t what my post is about but I think it illustrates why I got so passionate about this issue. My FSIL, who is maybe 10-20lbs overweight, is not at all and we have gotten into arguments in the past over thin privilege, etc...

One of my really big pet peeves is the lack of affordable, cute, clothing that is accessible to plus size women. If you can’t afford to shop at plus size “boutiques” then you’re basically relegated to very unflattering bag dresses from goodwill (al a Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s Mom).

Until I went wedding dress shopping with FSIL and the bridal party (which I think she’s only included me in because she was in mine 10 years ago when she was seventeen and dating my BIL and she feels bad) , I didn’t realize that the expensive cute plus size axiom extended to wedding dresses in a MASSIVE way, because I wasn’t plus size when I got married. But out of curiosity I realized that the few boutiques who has plus size dresses sold them for much more then the thin sizes. My SIL is kind of in between plus size sizing and regular sizing, depending on the boutique, because all she’s just chubby she is very short which makes the sizing go kind of nuts. 

Anyway after a few appointments my SIL hones I’m on a dress she likes but is insanely expensive. Her MOH then finds a few sample sales going where basically, she can get the look for half the price by buying straight off the rack and having it altered herself. She and the MOH went to the sample sales alone and she excitedly lets us know on WhatsApp that she got the dress! It’s just “a little bit big” and she has to have it altered. 

Well anyway I didn’t really think much of it until we were all at my MIL’s house for Father’s Day yesterday. She was talking about the dress and BIL goes “it must be 4 times your size” and she says “it’s really only a few sizes up but when it’s altered and I take some panels out it’ll be great”. I found myself getting really upset because it sounds like she bought a plus size dress, taking away that opportunity from an ACTUAL plus size bride who may not have had the money to afford one. While she had he privilege to be able to go to more sales or even buy from a boutique, this women would not have has the same abilities and it could have been her dream dress. 


I told my SIL about this and she basically told me to scram because she didn’t care. Well now I’m pissed and I gather my child and tell my husband to get a ride home. When he gets home later he’s clearly been talking to FSIL because he says she’s really upset that she upset me, and how could I have been so rude, etc. I have tried to teach him about the body positivity movement but he still doesn’t understand a lot of things and he wasn’t in the mood to listen and told me to get over it and apologize. But honestly this has made me want to quit the wedding party, or at least not show up for the next few events.

c1q80i	2019-06-17 17:14:02	Elleeebellee	AITA for telling my grandparents to quit their job?	"Throw away account for personal reasons but anyway:

My grandparents recently moved down closer to my family, about an hour to an hour and a half drive from where they used to live.

I (20F) went to their house yesterday and my grandmother told me they had to drive back to their old town for work tomorrow and I asked her why. She told me that the boss said they really needed them and nobody else could do that job. He sent them an extra weeks pay, a $200 gift card, a flower arrangement and some beer and asked them to come back and work for him 3 days a week. 

They wouldn't be getting a raise. I told her that if he is so desperate for them to come back that he should have no problem paying for the give or take 3 hours a day commute, the tolls to get there and the massive fare for the bridge they would need to take in each day. She was upset and told me it was okay since they get a special rate on the bridge if they cross it x times per week. I said he should have no problem covering  that rate then. I also told her that their car would need more maintenance travelling that often on a busy highway and they'd need to budget for that, too.

She then told me nobody else could do the job and he really needed them since nobody else was responding to the ad he put out for janitors. I said that it was his fault for knowing you were moving and not actively searching for a replacement for them to train and also his fault for not amping up the pay to be enough to attract workers. As it is my grandparents are paid an hourly rate that is less than many major retailers offer as base pay in our state-and they have been there 40 years. 

I told my mom when I got home what happened and she was really worried that I upset my grandparents with how I spoke to them. She said Grandma doesn't like when people ""act intelligent in front of her"" and probably felt attacked by how I criticized her choice. I told my mom that I wasn't trying to make her feel stupid, I was just trying to keep them from being taken advantage of. 

Dad says that even though I'm right, that it was a dick move for me to essentially tell them anyone can do their jobs. Grandpa has been at this job for 40 years and it wasn't okay to tell him he is replaceable when it is his life's work. 

So far everyone agrees that I should never have opened my mouth and that I was a dick for saying anything to my grandparents. Am I really the asshole, though? I don't think I said anything especially unreasonable to them to cause anyone to be legitimagely upset with me. I don't see why everyone would be mad at me and not at the employer asking this of my grandparents. They ended up agreeing to go 3x a week."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c1q7uv	2019-06-17 17:13:40		AITA for making one of my mothers cry by telling her she'll be alone for the rest of her life?	"I've had like 4 mothers cause my original 2 are lesbians when they had me and my siblings through IVF and they both had a set of twins. Me and my twin were born 4 years before our other two siblings with the same donor, so just after my two younger siblings were born my mothers broke up, but I remained very close with my non biological mother. 

So my two younger siblings grew up very different than me and my twin cause one is severely mentally disabled and the other one is ""normal"" if you don't count all the shit she's made up for him to spew when he misbehaves. 

They're 15 now and the regular one has no respect for anyone or anything, and is a manipulator who can play his mother like a fiddle. So one day he was disrespecting me and yelling at his brother, for the simple crime of going into the kitchen looking for his sunscreen so he can go outside (it's a problem with the mentally disabled one going in the kitchen to steal food but not to the degree that the other one was yelling at him for) so I go inside and tell him to stop yelling at him and he turns on me and starts going at me, disrespecting me and insulting me. So I slapped him and when he sat there and swore at me I did it again and he then tried to attack me. So I punched him in the face and his mother came in and started yelling at me and hitting me too. But then he tore my hat off my head and threw is behind him. Now I don't go anywhere without a baseball cap. So I go to get it but his mother is in the way and he's hiding behind her. Like an honorable person he takes a cheap shot at me hiding behind her so I push her out of the way and punched him in the face a few times before grabbing my hat and storming out. 

A few days later (Today) I get a call from my mom demanding an apology, when she failed and always does fail to admit when he does anything wrong (I honestly think he could murder someone and she would think it's just fine, as he threatened to ""murder me with a knife in my sleep"" and he received no repercussion) I said he has no respect and it was a result of her parenting. She said I swore at her and it was rude and disrespectful. This kind of broke something in me so I said to her that her child is going to drive everyone out of her life (he's already driven away 3-4 girlfriends of hers and several companies who help our mentally retarded brother) and that if she doesn't fix him she will in fact, die alone with him as her only company, she replied by crying and hanging up the phone. Though I feel bad for making her cry it is one of those things that had to be said and is true."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1q6m2	2019-06-17 17:11:12	pistol-whipped	AITA for not coming out to co-workers?	"So I (28M) have been in a relationship with my partner (30M) for 3 years and living together 2 years. Yesterday we went out to brunch to enjoy a nice breakfast by the beach and a few mimosas. As we are waiting for our Uber I mention to him that a co-worker invited me/co-workers out for drinks to celebrate his last day at the office. He suddenly snaps and says I don't care about him because I haven't came out to my co-workers and I'm ashamed of being gay. Now this caught me off guard, but it also upset me that he wanted to continue talking about this once inside the Uber. There is a time and place and I told him we can continue the conversation at home.   


Just to clarify, when him and I first met I had told him I wasn't completely out to family. And by that I mean my mum knows because of my ex (long story), but after she found out she chose not to want to talk about it. Her and I are close, but until she is ready then we can talk about it. I've also introduced him to my mum, never as a bf, but I know she knows. As far as friends, I am completely out. I've been told I don't come off gay so I don't go around introducing myself like, ""Hi I'm \*\*\*\* and I'm gay."" If they ask then I confirm.   


Back to the co-workers argument. My bf believes I'm ashamed of being gay because I don't come out to my co-workers. Here's the thing, I have been working in the IT industry for 5 years now, and my department has always been 90% older straight married males. I do not consider them friends, simply co-workers. We rarely get together outside of work unless it is company related, and never talk about our personal lives. Our Monday talks usually start out with ""how was your weekend?"" Everyone keeps it brief and it's back to work. I also do not lie and claim to date women. It's just something that never comes up and I believe it's my personal business.

The standard question is here: ""Do you tell your friend what you really think of their partner and risk losing the friendship""

Backstory: My friend (F24) got married to her husband (M24) at the age of 19. She is fun and energetic, but sometimes I worry about her decision making and sometimes can be immature. She lost her mom and a young age and sometimes I think she doesn't have many people to go to for womanly advice. Anyways... Her husband is... a hermit. Her and I have been friends for a few years and I have yet to see him. If he picks her up from an event, he drives away too fast for anyone to see him. If I go over to her house, he runs and hides in the bedroom. He doesn't come on double dates, or any type of party/get-together. It's very odd to me because she is such the opposite of him and an EXTREMELY outgoing person. She definitely doesn't let his hermit-ness get in the way of her lifestyle. Sometimes she voices her concerns to me about his shy nature and how it's gotten harder over the years as he has settled worse into his ways, but she always ends the conversation with this sentence ""But, I knew about his personality when I married him."" It's like she's constantly trying to talk herself out of being upset with him.

Present: Recently they have been trying to get out and do more things together, one of the activities they enjoy is gambling. She likes it because they get out of the house and they get to socialize, but I'm not to sure what he finds appealing about it, maybe there is no pressure since they socialize with strangers and not friends. idk. The other day she calls me in tears not knowing what to do. Apparently he went gambling while she was at work and called her because he lost a large amount of money that he took from their joint bank account. She has a stable job and is finishing her masters while he is a pizza delivery driver. She was furious since she works so hard and he spent basically all their savings. They have been on the rocks ever since.

I am trying really hard not to judge this guy too harshly for many reasons. (1) I haven't even met him. (2) I don't think it's fair to judge someone so harshly for their career choices and (3) I trust my friend and respect her decisions.

But I so badly want to tell her to dump this guy. Yes it's hard to start over in life since their finances are linked and they even own a house. But, would I be the asshole if I finally voiced my opinions to her out of concern for her future? It's not like this guy treats her badly or anything, and he doesn't sound like an asshole, he's just kind-of a bum and super irresponsible with money."	Not the A-hole	0	0	200.0	34.0	0.0	0.0

Talked to them about it, they don't give a shit. They're saying that they're allowed to smoke in their own home and there's nothing that they can do to help me, and I should close my windows.

c1q1xk	2019-06-17 17:01:21	TaKiDaLo	AITA for skipping office pot luck lunch?	"I work for a department that has about 35 people in it. We have an office pot luck lunch every quarter.  I have worked here for 4 years.

I have some food restictions that make these kinds of event uncomfortable for me. I am a vegetarian (22years now) and I have a severe allergy to eggs. In past jobs, people have been really great with food restrictions (not just mine, but everyone's in general) and an effort was made to always have several dishes for everyone to eat, whether it was vegetarian, or gluten free, or low sodium, or whatever. 

But this office absolutely does not. So the only thing I am ever able to eat at these lunches is whatever I have brought, and chips. Which of course leads to everyone questioning why I am not eating more, and me telling them yet again that I don't eat meat, and I am allergic to eggs. It's very uncomfortable for me to have people scrutinizing my diet and basically poking fun at me for being ""difficult"" and ""weird"". 

So rather than sit there uncomfortably watching everyone else eat for an hour, I just went out for lunch instead of participating in the office pot luck. Admin Assistant saw me heading out to lunch and asked if I set up my stuff for the pot luck yet cause it was about to start, and rather than just slipping out I had to explain to her that I had to run out for lunch to run errands and would t be at the pot luck. I got a really dirty look on response.

So, am I the asshole for skipping the potluck?

And also, am I the asshole for kind of expecting some consideration for my food restrictions by now? I dont expect the entire menu to cater to me, but at this point people have seen me sit there unable to eat well over a dozen times. Is expecting a dish or two that I can eat expecting too much?

c1q1tk	2019-06-17 17:01:07	GunterThePenguiNO	AITA for getting angry at my parent for throwing out my shoes without my knowledge or assent?	"So basically, here’s the situation:

My (16M) mother (45F) is a very caring and helpful individual who has always tried her hardest to be a good parent. She works hard and is always down to help out with school work, extra curriculars, or anything else we may need. Overall, she prides herself on being extremely helpful and on top of things, almost to a fault. I’ve had conversations with her about her easing up on everything and just letting me handle things, but she always wants to be helpful and involved in some way, whether it be researching job opportunities or editing my essays or even looking up health studies and advising me on my diet and exercise habits. In short, she is a model parent, and I could not be more lucky.

Today, however, I finally lost my cool, over something really really stupid. Basically, I had this pair of blue converse which I use for working out (I do StrongLifts 5x5, and these are the reccomended shoe, so don’t judge my fashion). I’ve worn them about for a few months and they’ve sort of become “worn in”, if you know what I mean. Personally, I don’t see anything wrong with using a pair of shoes for a few years, unless they stop fitting or something, and since I mostly use them to work out, I don’t see a problem with them being a little worn down. This morning, however, when I went to get to my shoes, I found they were missing. I looked around for them and found that they were nowhere to be found. At this point, I was mildly annoyed, so I called my mom and asked her if she knew where they were. She told me, point blank, that she threw them out, and when I asked her why, she said it was because they smelled bad (gross, I know), and that they looked ratty. When I heard this, I was furious. For one, I was mad that she had thrown out a pair of obviously functional sneakers without consulting me about it, since I was the person to whom the sneakers belonged in the first place ( and the person who was using them). I was also uncomfortable at the fact that she was poking around in my closet, smelling my shoes, without my knowledge. The whole situation peaved me. I know she’s my mother and that she was just trying to help, but the idea of someone smelling my things and deciding to throw them out makes me feel a little invaded. I snapped at her over the phone and used some colorful language to express my annoyance. 

I realize that I wasn’t at my most mature in that moment, but tell me, o wise redditors, was I justified in being annoyed? Is this something mothers usually do, or is this overreaching certain boundaries? Is it rational for me to assume that as the person using something, I am the best equipped to make the determination of its usefulness?

I like to ‘disappear’ after every major chapter of my life. After high school I did a social media purge of acquaintances I didn’t really get on well with or generally just people I had no intention of knowing later on in life. Same with university. I just finished my degree a few weeks ago and so I blocked a few hundred people  - why? Some I didn’t like, some I didn’t trust and well, some, I simply didn’t want them knowing me, and vice versa. Regardless of my reasoning I don’t message anything rude before I block someone, I just bounce. Disappear. 

Anyways I’m making this post because a lot of people I blocked had follower tracking apps and knew immediately. Many people were mad at me at the end of year party, for blocking them. I reassured them all that it was nothing personal at all, but everyone kept pressuring me for a reason. I was friendly and courteous to people in real life, I just had no desire to follow them online.

I have no obligation to follow anyone. When people unfollow me, I don’t complain - life is more than instagram or Twitter. Friendships shouldn’t revolve around social media platforms.

c1q0pi	2019-06-17 16:58:46		AITA for upsetting my mother for growing up?	"This has been happening for some years now, and I'll describe it in detail, so if you don't want to read all that you can just skip to tldr, also I'm writing this on my phone so sorry in advance for any spelling mistake.

My mom and I have been close for a very long time, I think since I was born, this was because my father was never around, would cheat, or be an asshole generally. He decided to tell my mom in 2009 that he was going to divorce her and she was devastated, she lost a lot of weight and started talking to men on social media, she wouldn't pay too much attention to me and I started to become a reckless kid. 

Two years later they had the divorce, I was going through a really rough time.Anyhow, I don't remember what really happened, but she somehow left the Internet for a guy from real life. They had a lot of fights to say the least and it was really tiring.

Now, I'm 17 and I have 2 more years until I'll move to a different city for college, and she keeps  attacking me. 
When I do something that somehow reminds her of my father, she'd say ""Myeah, that's exactly what he used to do, he was so dumb and I can't believe that you do unknowingly the same thing.""

Or it can be even worse when we get into fights and she would mention the fact that I'm not the same happy cute girl that used to be (in 2011 for example, which was not happy at all).
 I told her several times that I was NOT happy then, but she never seems to listen and memorise that.
 Another thing that she does, when I have fun and enjoy myself: ""That's exactly how my daughter was like!!!"".
 I often feel like I died or something and I'm just a ghost that reminds her of that little cute girl that once existed. I can't wait to move in the next years, but whenever I tell her how excited I am, she always ends the subject with :"" I'm going to move with you, I can't let my baby go alone"". Did I mention that I have to sleep with her at night because she can't sleep without me?

It's just annoying and frustrating for me, because when I was little she paid no attention to me, and now I seem to be the devil who killed that ""little baby"". I might be the asshole here, but I really want to have a life, I want to have a boyfriend in the future and not to worry whether she would tell him how ""changed"" I am. 

Whenever we go together somewhere, she'd kiss my cheek when I don't know, slap my butt, even talk to me like I am a toddler with a very high pitched tone and words such as ""my cute little baby"". 

Tldr: My mom adamantly misses the ""cute little girl"" that I used to be when I was 8 and she would always remind me that, talk to me like I am a toddler, even though I am 17. I also sleep in the same bed with her."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1pysu	2019-06-17 16:54:45	IDunnoIfImTheAsshole	AITA for hating my mom?	"Bad formatting, I'm on mobile. I'm a female in my teens, I've always thought my mom was a 'good' person. She cared for me and we did fun things, but in recent years (expecially this year) that has stopped. I think it began when my brother came into my life. One morning I was told how I had a half-brother. When my mom was in her 20's, she had a baby and put him up for adoption. He and his family had reached out to her because he had gotten his (now ex) girlfriend pregnant.

Long story short I'm an aunt now. My mom started getting into pot, to the point she is never off pot. She also started going on vacations. Alot. Without me or my dad. She would whine when she wasn't able to see my brother or nephew for a month and wanted us to move to his state badly.

Everything got worse when she told me she had bought tickets to a trip to Mexico for the event Anarcopulco. She hadn't told my dad. These tickets were damn expensive too. When my dad didn't go because of work and because he wasn't given enough notice, I didn't wanna go either! I was doing really well in my school and didn't wanna miss like two weeks of it, plus upon doing research Acapulco is known as one of the most dangerous cities (according to Google). I didn't go. Later me and my dad found out my mom had been flirting and sending nudes to a guy in London. My parents got divorced. My mom said she would still live with us and do work around the house so she could take me to school and such.

Not even a week later she started planning a trip to China with a guy she met a week earlier. She was going out every night to bars and often driving drunk. One night she gave marijuana to a stranger in a parking lot. She wasn't doing any work around the house (like she said she would to continue living with us rent-free) while telling me I don't do anything. After the divorce is final we (me and my dad) tell her we want her to leave. She throws a hissy fit. At one point I go to hug her because she's sobbing and she pushes me away and tells me she doesn't care.

Two days later she leaves and goes to London with the guy she was sending nudes to. She's been texting me and telling me she loves me and misses me while asking to see my art. I haven't responded to her at all. And I really do hate her.

c1py5n	2019-06-17 16:53:22	JaybirdTheNerd	AITA for not going out of my way to feed my sister's bugs?	"My sister is an entomologist. As such, she takes bugs as pets - currently she has some stick bugs.

Two weeks ago, she asked me to collect them some leaves for food. She knew I'd only be able to go late at night, as I was busy before, and she was fine with it. She told me to look for a bush with thorns in a specific area. 

Well, I went to that area - it's an by intersection of a highway, near our place, but it took me 29 extra minutes to get there otw home. I reached the place she had told me and called to ask where they were specifically - she informed me that I'd have to cross the fucking highway. I said no, but when she hung up, sounding pissed, I felt bad. So, I crossed the goddamn highway in the middle of the night to reach a dark patch of land with grass and bushes. 

I checked every bush I could see - none of them had thorns. I walked deeper in, going through tallgrass that could contain god knows what - nothing. I called her again, she gave me vague instructions, assuming I'd just know, then practically yelled at me to just leave it alone and come home. 

I kept searching for a few minutes until my mom called, asking what was taking me so long. I told her what I was doing, and she said ""At this hour?! Here, let me let you talk to her."" Over the line, I can hear my sister yelling ""Didn't I tell him to leave it alone?!"" Then she picks up and yells at me. 

By now, I give up and I headed home angry. I figured she'd collect the leaves herself later, and all would be fine. 

It's now two weeks later. 

She just came back from her three day trip to find that, unfortunately, all but three of the bugs are dead. She said something like ""Ah shit, I'll get dressed and go out to bring these remaining ones food,"" then she paused. ""I couldn't feed them before I left because I couldn't get to the bush and YOU couldn't find the right one! Like how hard is it to find [specific type of bush]?!""

That caught me way off guard. It's been TWO WEEKS. The place is /20 minutes away/ from our place at MOST. She never had an hour to spare over two fucking weeks?! She couldn't just ask me to go again?! 

I told her, very clearly, ""I went out of my way to go there, in the middle of the night, and you yelled at me for not being able to find it.""

She yelled again for a few minutes, then said ""I'll go out, so follow me and I'll show you where it is"". I just stared at her. ""No. I've been studying all day, and my exams are coming up. I'm not going anywhere.""

""So what, are they supposed to starve?! I'm leaving again soon, what will they do then?!"" At this point, I'm unsympathetic. I tell her to take a picture of the bush and I'll recognize it next time, she looks at me like I smacked her. Then she says ""thanks"" in the most passive agreessive tone and stops speaking to me. 

I'm fucking mad at her since I went out of her way as a favour and she fucking yelled at me for it, but at the same time I do feel bad for the bugs dying.

"My GF (19F), her friend (20F) , her boyfriend (21M), and I (22M) went to a cafe to catch up. One of the topics was the other couples long-ish trip to Amsterdam. One of the topics was comparing the weather in London (where all of us are based in, neither of us born or raised there though) and Amsterdam. My GF's friend couldn't stop talking about how Amsterdam weather is much better (much less rain, sunnier) than that of London. Now, I have been in Amsterdam on several occasions and it seems to be the same. But I wouldn't base it on my opinion even though it is much more experienced than hers. Instead, I look up (on my phone) verified meteorological statistical data that goes back 10 years and has prediction for the next 10. On temperature/ chance of precipitation/ amount of rainfall London appears to me on average much better to live throughout the year. I mentioned this and told her it is not very smart to base opinions like that on anecdotes, personal or not, because it could be misleading. I further gave an example how last summer was scolding hot in London and most of the UK because of a rare heathwave which is not even remotely close to the average/standard.  


Her expression changed so fast and she started throwing a tantrum that I called her stupid etc and saying that I am some educational elitist (my education does have a statistical/scientific component) and that only my opinion matters. Meanwhile, I simply wanted to point this out because going by this in life when useful data is available is a simpleton thing to do and can hurt you lol. My GF is on her side and says I was an ass.

c1pwhj	2019-06-17 16:49:30		AITA for wanting my S.O. to re-home his dog?	"My S.O and I have lived together for 3 years. When we moved in together,  we each had an old-lady dog. Later we adopted a pair of kittens. It was a happy little pack.

Starting in late 2018, we hit a rough patch. His car got totaled. His dog died. We had some fights that strained our relationship. One of the cats vanished (likely dead).  After months of struggle,  our relationship was getting back on track and we decided to go ahead and adopt a new dog. 

My ONLY requirements were (1) that S.O take a more active role in parenting the new dog, and (2) that the new dog get alone with the remaining pets in the home (OldDog and Cat).

I wanted to get a laid-back, young-adult, verified-cat-friendly dog through a foster.  S.O.  REALLY wanted a husky or German shepherd puppy. I thought that age/breed would be a bad fit for our fur family and busy lifestyle, but figured we would find a middle ground.

Last week, S.O. went to the pound and adopted a young husky (NewDog). TO BE CLEAR:  I gave SO authority to act unilaterally if he found ""the one""!  But when I brought OldDog to the shelter for a dog-on-dog meet, I had concerns. NewDog is BEAUTIFUL, sweet and VERY, very smart. But he's also high energy, assertive and has a strong prey drive.

We went home and discussed it briefly;  When I explained that I didn't think NewDog would be right for our family/lifestyle. S.O. became REALLY UPSET. He he felt steam-rolled because I didn't give NewDog a chance. He said it was ""lose-lose"" for him: like his vote didn't count, but if we got the dog now I'd resent him for ""guilting"" me into it.  I do badly with conflict, and eventually I agreed to get NewDog. That was Friday. 

Saturday was really good. S.O. was totally right-  NewDog is AWESOME! Smart, sweet, happy, eager to please... But as he got more comfortable, he became more assertive. He got in a fight with OldDog when she tried to share his toys, and after that she started hiding under the bed.  Meanwhile, Cat is locked up in the office and miserable. We tried to do some controlled introductions, but New Dog has a STRONG prey drive. S.O.assures me we can train it out (NewDog is smart and trainable), but everyone I've spoken to about the breed says that's not possible; He can be trained to ignore the cat, but the drive is always there- one lapse in discipline will be the death of the cat.

NewDog is super sweet, smart and wonderful, but I think he needs to be in a cat free home and maybe the only dog.   But S.O. is COMPLETELY and TOTALLY, CRAZY  in love with NewDog.  If I ask S.O. to give up NewDog ""too soon"" he'll be so upset and resent me for not giving it a chance/trusting him to train NewDog.... But I don't want to wait for something bad to happen to Cat or OldDog before taking action.   AITA?  What should I do?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Anyway, I'm a college student (19 M) and I just got back home from school last night. I've known for the past year that I would have to do my wisdom teeth this summer but we hadn't yet set an appointment. My mom, being worried about getting it done, called the dentist with me there and the available appointment times were today, Friday, and in a couple of weeks. I wanted to be sedated so I didn't want to do it today(at that office, the sedation process is started the night before the operation) and I had an important therapy(I deal with pretty severe depression... But my parents are mostly unaware of the severity of it so she might not see the importance of it) appointment on Saturday so I didn't want to do it Friday. Because of that, I preferred to do it in a few weeks. My mom was really upset about this because she and my dad were going on an anniversary trip around that time and she didn't want to worry about me. Also, she had some other reasons like she didn't want to delay it so long that I wouldn't be able to do it until next year. Either way, she was very upset and tried to make me feel really guilty about insisting that I did it in a few weeks.

Either way, my parents are paying and while I wouldn't be opposed to calling the dentist myself, she called before I even thought to so maybe at that point, I shouldn't have any say. Either way though, I just don't understand where she's coming from. She's said that I've been being selfish but I just feel like I know what's best for me."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

When him and I first started dating, I LOVED his family. They were welcoming, warm, everything I wanted from potential future in-laws. For his last spring break in college, they booked a vacation as a surprise for him, and asked me to join if I paid my airfare. I said yes immediately, and we all kept it a surprise from him until Christmas. 

After this, things started falling apart. We were long distance, and his family always made passive aggressive remarks about how much he traveled to see me, how they didn't get an equal amount of time with him, how we never go to see them when I'm in town, etc. His family is also different from mine, so during the spring break vacation, they perceived me as being rude even when I didn't feel like I was being rude. They told me in front of everyone that I had poor manners and that they wish they could send me home. Needless to say, I was overly embarrassed and apologized profusely, but the damage was done. We awkwardly spent 2 more days with the family and returned home.

It was awkward after that, but it became super hostile after he proposed that summer. He told them several weeks prior to proposing that he had bought a ring, and they were shocked. They told him that he was 'throwing his life away', that he was 'too young', and that he was throwing away all the dreams they had for him. Needless to say, our relationship with his family was strained after that.

We all talked it out and sort of made amends, but then they kept making excuses for not wanting to get to know my family, meet them, etc. They also kept saying things about how they felt like I didn't want to be part of their family, how he needs to split his time equally between them and me, and how we always spend more time with my family.

For the upcoming wedding, they have expressed hesitation in spending more time with my family. We have invited them to activities the day before the wedding, but they are more than content with just meeting my family at the rehearsal dinner and the wedding. Outside of those times, they said they have their own family activities planned.

Now, they've been pretty nice to me after everything has gone down, and I don't want to burn bridges. But I am having a hard time embracing his family, and my fiance is having a hard time wanting to spend time with his own family as well. I feel like I keep holding onto this resentment when I should just accept that we have differences and be mature about the whole thing.

c1ptvn	2019-06-17 16:43:47	10ccazz01	AITA for cutting off a long-time friend over a joke, and without notice?	"So bear with me. This may sound at first like a clear NTA but I truly am conflicted here.

I have this friend, let's call him C. C (M24) and I (F24) have known each other for about 6 years and grew much closer in the last 3 years while I was living abroad. It all culminated last summer when I came home for 2 months and ended up developing romantic feelings for him.

I decided a few months later to move back home in December. About two weeks after I came back, I admitted my feelings for him and he got mad at me for ""ruining the friendship"". We stopped talking and barely saw each other since he now lives in another town, but met up a few times because we share a friend group.

Now fast-forward to April. Things were getting better (or so I thought) and we all went to the restaurant to celebrate my other friend getting a scholarship. There were 8 of us, all our good friends, including my now-bf. C was being rude to me all evening, but it wasn't that bad until I mentioned I was going home instead of going out to the bar with them because I worked the following morning. I paid my bill, put on my coat but stayed to chat with my friends for about 15 minutes before he rudely asked (loud enough to draw everyone's attention) why I was still there. I left, hurt and angry, and we stopped talking for another 2 months.

Now, about 2 weeks ago, I made the effort to contact him. He has been a very close friend for years, and don't want to lose him over this. My friend and my bf  told me he too wants to mend and feels bad for the restaurant incident. So I texted him, and we started talking a bit. It was all very mundane, everyday stuff. Nothing about our fall outs.

Yesterday he came into town for Father's Day so we saw each other.  I was wearing make up and (low) platform heels. Now, for a bit more background: my friends have known me for years as the not-girly girl. I didn't wear make up for years. It had much to do with the fact that I had difficulty owning my femininity, and after years of learning to love myself and my body, gaining confidence and such, I started getting into make up for fun, and not for validation. 

When I saw C, he looked surprised since he hasn't since me ever with a full face of make up. He made a joke about me ""trying to become a real girl"". I'm pretty sure he meant it as a joke but it hurt me and I thought it was unnecessary, especially since it was said in front of everyone.

When I got home I sent him a text telling him I was cutting him out of my life, that I didn't need someone toxic like that and not to contact me again.

Now, this is where I feel bad: my friend and my bf both think I'm being too harsh, that C didn't have bad intentions, and that I should have given him notice that this was my last attempt at mending. They think I should instead give him another chance, this time being clear it's the last one. They also think I overreacted to the joke and that he loves me and doesn't deserve this.

The woman who lives upstairs had a closed head injury years back, car accident I believe. She still drives, still works, still lives a normal life. I feel like this matters because I try to give her my understanding. Shes nice enough,  waves hello when she walks to the mailbox, brings us eggs from the chickens out back sometimes. But she also does strange things a lot. Shes always over staying. She will knock as I'm finishing dinner and stay and watch us eat instead of excusing herself. Or see me on the porch with family and bring my mail (which bothers me as it is, she only does this if people are here) then interrupts whatever conversation is happening to whine about her job, usually for at least 30 minutes or until my company gets weirded out and leaves. Recently it's been her coming over and not leaving when I tell her I need to feed my son or she will keep talking even as I'm walking away because he is crying. In the last week I've caught her looking into our bedroom window at him twice. 
So our sons crib is in our room because he is still so young. We have a door in our bedroom that leads outside to one of our two porches. She has taken to knocking on this door, only since our son was born. I have asked her not to. Nicely. I lost my cool a bit today. 
My son just had his first round of vaccines and is not taking it well. Hasn't been sleeping, crying a lot, that sort of thing. This morning, after being up all night, he finally falls asleep. Bliss.
Here comes the neighbor lady banging on my bedroom door like shes the cops. I ignore it in hopes that she does away. She knocks harder and I swing the door open, give her a ""what the fuck look"" then nastier than I intended said ""Do not knock on this door again, this is my bedroom."" Her jaw dropped slightly and she looked honestly shocked and hurt. She handed me some eggs and said she did knock on the front door but no one answered then quickly walked away. 
I immediately felt like an asshole. Part of me wants to apologize, part of me feels like I should have done that sooner.

c1pn04	2019-06-17 16:28:45	missusunce	WIBTA if I refused to get baptised even though my entire family would?	"Okay, hear me out. A bit of background info first. For as long as I can remember, my family has been very not religious. My dad is straight up an atheist, the grandparents too. My mom, however, is somewhere inbetween and let's just leave it at that because I don't even get it.

Religion was never a big talk in our house and my sister and I were free to make our own choice as to what we believed in and well, atheism it is. There was never a problem with that, and if we were to make a different choice our parents always made it clear that it was our choice and completely okay.

About 6 months ago, my mom got diagnosed with a serious auto-immune disease. I won't go into too much details, but basically her immune system is too strong and fighting itself, so with a very extreme therapy it is weakened. For this reason, she can't leave the house ever because of the risk of catching a simple cold or anything which could end catastrophically for her. You get it, it's pretty serious.

Obviously, this was a major shock to the entire family and we needed time to adjust. My mom was desperately looking for a ray of hope or something, and about a month into the diagnosis I noticed she hanged a small statue of Jesus Christ right above her bed. I had no problem with this, if this helps her one bit I'm all for it. 

The problem arises when my parents sat us down and told us they want the entire family to get baptised. I immediately expressed my opposition to the idea. I get my parents are crazy worried because of the disease and took a leap of faith, but it was just too much. For me, a person who is still firmly atheist and has never even been to a church or did anything close to religious, getting baptised feels very permanent. Maybe I'm overthinking this, but I wouldn't feel comfortable going on with my life knowing that I committed to something I don't believe in at all. And it's not like I am a small child and my parents have to make decisions for me, I am mature enough to have a say in this. 

Anyway, I couldn't fathom why the entire family would be down to do this, but they couldn't understand why I was so adamant about refusing. This was the topic of our convos for the last 2 months maybe, but last week they asked me again and told me they were going to go through with it in a couple of days. They did tell me I could decide for myself, but it was very obvious they would greatly prefer if I went with it. 

AITA here? I know this is my decision we're talking about, but I keep thinking about my entire family thinking I betrayed them somehow and just decided to be stubborn for no reason at all. Of course, I want my mother to get better, but I don't see how this is a way and I just think it's something serious that people shouldn't do without believing."	Not the A-hole	0	0	188.0	72.0	0.0	0.0

Now I’ve got a small friend group, and I casually mentioned to them how I’m planning on learning Spanish for my work since none of the Mexicans speak fluent English, enter our very liberal friend, who immediately called me out as a racist because “it’s not okay to talk to assume they can’t speak English, and it’s not okay to just start talking to them in their language” because apparently that’s offensive?  Only one other person agreed with her, while the others and I shrugged it off as her just going overboard about it.

I have flown to her monthly until this month, because the contact of my job ended and it was been rough for me. She didn't take it well and basically went cold on me and always asks when I'll visit, I say July but it's not June and that means I don't care. She has depression and she posts on instagram stuff about not how no one cares and generally depressing stuff.

So after the job loss I have kind of had a career crisis, I studied film and tried hard to get into the industry but it's just not working. So I'm trying out marketing, the job I had was helping start up company with their social media and I loved it. I recently got a job in marketing that starts in September, the catch is that it's in Madrid, but they give me Spanish classes and enrol me in a marketing qualification all part of my contract, it feels like the perfect opportunity to career switch and see Spain. I tell my girlfriend the news, and explain that not only are flights cheaper, but they have teaching jobs which I can get her, which is her dream. She doesn't just refuses, she says I shouldn't go, that love is about sacrifice and I should stay in the UK to let her move in with my parents or I move to Poland and teach English. I hate teaching but also she cannot move into my parents, my brother has severe autism and has outbursts if things change, my parents can't let her just move in because we have to plan everything around him so he is ok. She says ""what if he loves me"" and ""he's part of the family too like I will be"". 

&#x200B;

Now for the second WIBTA,The catch is I'm expected to pay for it all, she studies and I work, I didn't think much of it when working but I always had set money aside for my dream trip to hike around Russia. She hates hiking and doesn't consider this a vacation. Slowly as my contract didn't seem to renew I was finding online work for her, that she can do while studying to make extra cash for the trip, she doesn't. I confront her saying that I cannot afford to take her, she replies ""so we aren't going?"". and then it got awkward, I said it has been my dream for years, it's only two weeks. She said I should do everything together and there will be days I won't have signal so cannot talk to her all the time. All her friends say I don't give a fuck about her and she should be careful, even publicly one time on facebook where friend posted a random meme quote like ""don't you hate it when you realise someone doesn't care about you"", she replies with "":("" and the friend goes ""remember they're missing out and there's people who care about you out there"", it was obviously about me but I didn't confront anyone about it.

After growing up broke and overeating from emotional pain due to my mom never allowing me to cry, I started eating less because I felt like I didn't deserve food. My brother, on the other hand, gets ALL the food he wants. He's 11 and 150lbs. When I was his age, I had to watch what I ate because my mom always told me to ""save some for my brother."" 
Recently, I went to get some Taco Bell. I came home and my brother walked up to me and said ""Did u get me anything"" I told him no, you didn't ask. My mom gave me shit by telling me I should ask him if he wants anything. 
A few days later, I went to get some McDonald's. My brother was NOT in the house at all. He went with my dad to the store. When I came back, my brother expected me to have something for him. My mom gave me hell again by saying ""WHY DIDN'T YOU GET HIM ANYTHING?!""

c1pknn	2019-06-17 16:23:45		AITA for cutting off my best friend because she keeps going back to her boyfriend?	"So let me give some context my best friend, who we'll call Sarah, is also my ex. We broke up over a year ago after a rocky relationship but eventually became really close friends. Shortly after our breakup she got with a new man. Since she got with her new boyfriend he has shown a lack of care for Sarah's feelings and has lied on multiple occasions about both large and small things. Lying about talking to other women, making plans and cancelling last minute, ignoring her for hours on end when they have made plans and even acting like her diagnosed depression isn't that serious. He has also put his family above her is all scenarios, even treating her like crap and breaking promises just because his family has asked him to do something different. 

On multiple occasions she has called me for me to console her because she has been hurt by something he has done, myself and others have told her is she is unhappy more often than she is happy with him then that should be a sign that he isn't right for her. However despite how many times he lies, they fight and he says he will change he hasn't shown any desire to follow through on that in the year they have been together. Not to mention he will also project and make Sarah feel bad for things that she should no reason to feel bad for.

Now with the overall context out of the way I'll explain what led up to me cutting her off. A few weeks back they had made plans to go see a spoken word poet, Sarah's favourite, a man who has really impacted her life. She had bought the tickets months in advance and her boyfriend had stated multiple times he would come, book work holidays, get cover, even call in sick of it meant he could be there. Roll on closer to the time and it's clear that he isn't going to go. The day before and he cancels while she is in work and can't even reply. Sarah heartbroken that he would cancel yet another plan decided that she didn't want to be with him anymore, that it was the last straw.

After acting like nothing had happened despite how upset Sarah was, She meets up with him to talk and he calls her a liar. Apparently lying about Sarah's mum having a stroke (which definitely happened). Sarah's mum then shows up to explain that it was in fact true, he still claims it's a lie. Sarah's mum, notably angry argues with him when he gets scared away. He then claims he wants a break, Sarah finally admits she's better off without him, only then for him to make her feel bad about everything, blaming it all on Sarah, she eventually goes back to him again only a day or so later.

I couldn't watch my best friend go through more heart break and told her how I felt and that I can't keep watching this happen again and again. So I wouldn't be talking to her anymore despite how much that hurts me, I believed it would hurt me more to watch her stay with a man who treats her so poorly.

Am I the asshole for doing this?

"So little backstory, Me (19M) and family are really close with this other family, they have 2 kids, one my age and the other with down syndrome 5 years younger then me, we hang out regularly and have been doing so since I was 8 years old.

So I was supposed to go to the pool with both the boy my age and his brother, but his brother cancelled last minute- I decided to just hang out with DS family friend anyways because he is home schooled and doesn't get to socialize normally. He tends to lash out and get easily upset, especially since he is around the age of 'body-changes', I noticed giving him lots of attention usually calms him down.

Anyways we are at the pool minding our own business sitting pool side with out feet in the water when he tells me he's hot. I was holding a water bottle so I poured it on top of his head, I kept refilling the bottle and pouring it over his head, this lady, who can only be described as your typical Karen came running over and screaming at the top of her lungs. She told me to leave him alone and snatched the bottle out of my hand. I tried explaining that he was my friend and I was just trying to cool him off. She wasn't having it, and for some reason DS friend was just sitting looking down. 

All the commotion caused a huge scene and people started walking over, by the way she was talking, she was trying to make sure everyone heard her. She would ramble on and on but always say ""how dare you bully a child with down syndrome"" at least once in every sentence. People started to get angry and chime in. I had to keep explaining that he was my family friend, and that I was just trying to cool him off. DS friend finally said ""I told him to do that"", afterwards most people walked away, but there was a consensus amongst the people who stayed, Karen said ""Don't make it appear like you're bullying a child with a terrible disorder, it makes you look like an asshole"". 

I was mad that she mentioned DS as a disorder like its something awful, it seems like she doesn't realize that he has feelings and has the ability to comprehend what she had said. He was visibly sad.

Anyways, we got home and I explained to his parents what happened. To my surprise, they actually said that I shouldn't be doing things like that in public which would make a scene or make me look like the bully.

AITA? I was just trying to hang out and have a fun day with him, did I really do anything wrong? I fail to see where I could possibly have been the asshole.

TL;DR- Went to pool with my down syndrome friend, lady thought i was bullying him, called me an asshole, parents said I shouldn't be doing things to paint me out as the bully"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"So basically my Dad in my eyes is an asshole he was absent for most of my life and when he was there he cause havoc. Let me just list the stuff that happened before I was even walking. While my mom was in a coma after I was born my dad after I was stable TOOK ME OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AND TRIED TO LEAVE THE STATE. Thankfully my uncle(my real dad for me) stopped him and once my mom was back she took him to court and she was granted possession of me as we were much more well off. However us being better of quickly change as my dad hired a hitman yes a Motherfucking hitman to stalk and KILL my mom just to get me. The hitman would constantly scare my mom telling her what she was wearing and were she was and what she was doing and when he would kill her and how. So she abandoned every single thing she had and left her house with me and we lost so much money my mom had to travel to different continents for months on end to earn enough.
Eventually we got back on our feet and after consecutive promotions we moved to Guatemala in Central America at this time I was around 9 keep in mind my dad only asked for me once which was right before I left and on the car ride to his house he told me he had gotten engaged. Ps for some reason my parents didn’t get married they were about to after I was born but after the whole falling out yeah. So fast forward to when I’m 14 and living in Uganda where I live now. It’s my birthday and I decide that I need to reconnect so I called him and used the best form of communication video games.  However we had another fight and I have stopped talking to him because he didn’t want me to play with my friends as much as I do and I said no so he exploded and said “I’m more important then your friends” and I replied no they’ve been with me longer than you have dad you haven’t even said happy birthday for the past 7 years.

So this all started when I was hanging with a friend (R) and her boyfriend (J) on their porch when their neighbors 6-7 year old girl shows up and starts talking with us. The kid was just messing around with some of the toys and stuff lying around and whatnot while we were talking about random stuff. It was a while ago so I forgot exactly how this came up but the kid said something along the lines of ""I'm gonna shoot ya"" in a totally playful tone while making the gun shape out of her hands. 

J responds with ""well, I'll shoot you back then"" and makes a similar hand signal and pew pew noises. I join in on what seemed to be a friendly pew pew match with a kid having fun. 

About a week later R decides to text me about how disappointed she is in us for saying ""we would shoot this kid"". I simply say that it seemed to me the kid was just playing and that I've done it before with kids who play that way (used to teach swim lessons to kids 3 and up). R just gets more aggressive saying that what I did was inappropriate and how I should never say that to a kid because its ""childish"", yet I was an adult being playful with a child, is that not normal for an adult to act a little childish in that situation? 

This goes back a forth a bit until she finally let's me in on ""something that isnt my business"". R says that the kid said ""I'll shoot ya"" because she either had been or is abused and hears that phrase while it was/is happening. 

When I hear this I take back my position since obviously what I said in this context was inappropriate for the girl. But this wasnt enough to for R. Apparently context does not matter at all in this situation and that I'm a ""dumbass"" for arguing something ""so simple"". Starts claiming I'm on a high horse and ""not that smart"" when I start asking/blaming the girls current guardian about abuse.

My husband (26) and I (25f) got married last August, and have lived together for 2 years now. A friend of my husband's has taken advantage of our hospitality, as he lives with his grandparents and feels he can't get privacy there. Let's call him Joe (30m). He comes over almost every night, eats dinner with us (without being offered food) and drinks our beer. My husband has lightly tried to say that he needs to give us space, and the friend has also admitted he knows he's at our house too much but continues to visit constantly. So often when he comes over, I go to another room to hangout because I don't always enjoy his company. I don't think I'm rude, I'm just an introvert and enjoy my space. This weekend, we had some friends over and Joe got really drunk and belligerent at our house. So, again, I removed myself from the situation and cleaned up some things upstairs. Downstairs, I hear Joe say ""I guess transcendentramblin is upstairs being pissed off as usual hahahha."" First off, excuse me. You take advantage of us all the time and then feel the need to talk shit about me? I went downstairs to confront him and of course he denied saying anything. I took my husband aside and asked if Joe could leave and I didn't appreciate what he said. He agreed and said he would get him to leave as smoothly as he could. I went back upstairs. I hear Joe say again ""See, what did I say. Pissed off as usual."" One of my girl friends (26f) took it upon herself to show Joe private text messages between myself and her, basically me venting to her about Joe being over all the time and not knowing how to deal with it because he's sensitive as fuck, and drunk all the time, and I don't like conflict. Especially drunk conflict. Joe got extremely pissed reading those messages, started a fight with another friend, and I ultimately asked him to leave before I called the cops. I don't need people throwing punches in my front yard at 1am. Grow the fuck up. The girlfriend and her husband left immediately after showing the text messages because they knew an implosion was coming. Really great friends, right? Anyhow, I texted my friend and said I didn't appreciate her doing that and said it started a fight. She responded with ""well you should have told him a while ago what you were feeling."" Well, duh, but when he was piss drunk wasn't a good idea. AITA for not wanting to talk to my girl friend anymore? What happened to girl code? AITA for being slightly pissed at my husband for not standing up for me? In his defense, he's practically deaf, there was background music and multiple people talking. I'm trying to view this as a blessing in disguise, as Joe will hopefully fuck off now, but I can't help feeling resentment towards the girlfriend. How am I supposed to trust her with anything again?"

When I first got with her I shrugged it off as something sisters do and thought nothing of it. But now it’s starting to weird me out.

One night my girlfriends wearing a seductive dress that I later tear off her and then two days later her sister is wearing it, it’s a head fuck. 

I ask her about a thong I’ve never seen her wear before, turns out it belongs to her sister, great thanks for ruining that

I’m not just talking about the occasional dress or pair of shoes when they need them in an emergency, I’m talking the whole wardrobe is up for grabs at any time

Worst of all is the clothes I buy her turn up on her sister as well which I find quite rude. 

When I asked her she told me they do technically own their own things they just mix all their clothes together and take whatever they want from the wardrobe 

The only thing they don’t share is the obligatory stolen boyfriend hoodie she took from me 

I can’t really explain why it bothers me, but I suppose it’s because I can’t just enjoy it when she looks nice or dresses up or buys something new cause I know and dread seeing her sister wearing them later

I try and lay hints Like “hey I love that dress on you, you should save it for date nights”
It doesn’t work 

I really wish they would just split what they own and mostly stick to their own stuff

I’ve been in a complicated relationship with this person, we’ll call A, for the past few years. I’ll spare the salacious specifics, but I don’t mean in a dating fashion, and so obviously I’ve never mentioned A to my family in this time. They aren’t aware A exists (yet). 

Very recently though, the nature of the relationship between A and I has started to evolve, and while neither of us would comfortably call each other SOs at this point, we’ve begun to go on some actual dates. I think we’re both beginning to feel differently about each other than we have before. 

Now that that’s all out of the way, let me get into my moral dilemma. My brother is getting married out in the mountains, and though the wedding is small, I get a plus one. As such, I would like to bring A, but I know for a fact it would cause family drama with my grandparents. We all love them dearly, but true to their generation their exceedingly racist and I know they will throw a fit if I brought A. While I wouldn’t be too concerned about the potential fallout of this on a typical occasion, this day is supposed to be all about my brother, and I don’t want to knowingly detract from that by being the source of family drama (To be clear—only my grandparents, no one else—would be upset). On the other hand, I’m not sure I should feel any sort of responsibility since it’s not me doing anything wrong but my grandparents. There’s no question my grandparents are the bad guys here, but I want to know that since I doubtlessly know I can count on their reaction (and attendance—In case you were thinking there was some way they might be uninvited), if inviting drama on this day by bringing A means I WBTA too?"

We all share a kitchen which is located at the end of the corridor. Most people don’t cook very much, since there is a canteen nearby serving breakfast lunch and dinner. I tend to cook a lot to save money, and also because the canteen food is very repetitive and not particularly healthy. 


One thing i cook quite often is korean bbq prawns, i make it maybe 2-3 times a week. I’m not pescatarian exactly but I’m quite fussy about meats so I end up eating mostly fish and seafood, with the occasional beef or pork. 
A few weeks ago one of my neighbors told me i need to stop cooking with prawns because it makes her room smell for hours (her room is right next to the kitchen). I knew it made the kitchen smell bit i didn’t think it bothered anyone since most people only go in there to make tea or heat up microwave food- as I said most people eat in the canteen and the kitchen is too small to be used as a social space. 

Obviously I felt bad that she could smell it from her room, but I also didn’t want to have to change my diet because of it. I told her to just open her windows and get some air freshener. 

She didn’t talk to me again for a few weeks so I assumed the issue had been resolved, until I found out she asked to be moved to a different room but was told there were none available. 

She’s now demanding that I switch rooms with her, since I’m the one causing the problem. I don’t want to do that though. Partially because her room has a an opposite mirror image to mine (for the layout and furniture) and i would feel weird in an opposite room. And also because I don’t want my room to smell like prawns either, to be honest. 

Does that make me a dick? I was assigned this room so nobody can force me to move. I’m also perfectly within my right to cook prawns, (I don’t leave the kitchen in a mess or anything, unlike some of the other girls)


Edit: jeeeesus christ have any of you even been a student ever? do you have any idea the amount of shit you have to put up with when you live in close quarters with a bunch of 18 year olds?? the showers are fucking disgusting, people leave their trash out in the corridor when they can’t be fucked taking it down to the bins, food gets stolen from the fridges, there’s almost always somebody playing loud music, people have room parties or make stupid amounts of noise coming home late... i don’t think i owe it to everyone to stop making prawns any more than we all owe it to each other to respect the accommodation’s code of conduct. and at least i’m genuinely NOT breaking a single rule with my fucking PRAWNS"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We met through Tinder 1 year ago and everything was going swimmingly for the first the first 6 months and we talked on a daily basis for hours at a time.

One afternoon we somehow got to the topic of my previous marriage and how we used to keep a wish list and when a birthday/Christmas would come up we'd just buy each other what was on the wish list..
It was coming up to Christmas at this point and I joked that she'll (my tinder date) will want me to buy her a new car. 
But I did offer should she need anything over the Christmas period especially for her younger 6 year old daughter who was incredibly sweet.

A week later I get an email from her with an actual wish list with $300 worth of gift cards, perfume and other things. I was shocked.

She didn't bring it up but things subsequently started to get awkward between us and I was quite annoyed she'd do that.
I stopped seeing her as often and about 2 months later we just stopped talking as much.

Fast forward another two months and we'd been talking on and off but not regularly - she would say things like ""how she missed the way we used to talk"".

Eventually I kinda just gave up and I deleted her from most of my social media.
I didn't say anything to her as we weren't really talking much anymore

Quite honestly I didn't think it would've worked out 
A few days after I get a few angry messages from her of how ""we could've been friends""

It turns out that there's a good part of her social circle generally goes to these shows and she has a really great time. I'm a member of this group that gets discount tickets so I've been buying our tickets for these events and she'll pay me back. The next one is for Thursday and it's sold out. She hasn't paid me yet (but I usually don't expect her to until the show or even a bit after - this isn't the issue). We were really looking forward to it...

... Until this weekend when she made a huge scene while we were out for dinner with some of her friends. I won't get into details but she basically started yelling at me for being stupid and arrogant for half an hour. It got so bad that one of her friends actively defending me and the others were just taken aback (they arrived after it all started, but mainly saw her screaming at me while I sat there calmly and either made rational statements when I could get an word in edgewise, but mostly just took her rant).

She has offered a half-assed apology ""I'm sorry you're upset"" and agreed that she needs to be a better listener. This isn't close enough for being good enough for me. While things will settle down eventually, I do not want to go to the show with her anymore.

WIBTA if I sold off her ticket?

\[Edit - just in case people think this is a validation post. While she hasn't paid for the ticket yet, it was very much understood that it was earmarked for her. She still wants to go and didn't buy herself a ticket before because I took care of it for her. It's now sold out, so she couldn't get tickets if she wanted to.

c1pa38	2019-06-17 16:01:15	faratnight	AITA to have asked a friend to uninvite someone?	"I have a friend, let's call him E, who likes to entertain and spends quite some money each year.

I've already told him to stop spending so much, so he doesn't attract  parasites (not participating in the chores and merely paying the small fee for alcohol. It's not really only for booze but also to be put back in E's wallet) but as it's not my event or my money, I don't have any rights to say anything. I am not legit to ask anything and never did...

Till this year where his friend, let's call her C, former friend or myself (she was nasty to a friend and I last year during holidays) talked shit about one of their common friend.

A guy C totally got on the hook and she drained him (making V drive to all the places she wanted to go during the holidays last year or paying for foods she likes). 
But again, I cannot interfere. He was interested in her. I cannot say anything. 

My friend E also organised his birthday this year and during the event, C said some nasty stuff about V and showed degrading videos of him to one of her friend, mocking him on his weight, his look and how he gets no chance with her. 

I heard that and was about to smack her there with a plate (more a intrusive thought than an actual will) . Luckily a friend dragged me in a room so I calmed down.

The host E heard that but he is so nice, he pretended not having heard that.

After the event, I stayed behind to clean and after, I asked him to uninvite her from the yearly event.

(Note : she wasn't invited to the event at first. She obliged  E to invite her by asking him to invite her, she cornered him and as E wants to be friendly to everyone, he eventually gave up and said yes.) 

So, I spent some time talking to my friend E to uninvite her because otherwise the ambiance during the event won't be good. She talked shit about V, me and another friend during the event. Who knows what she says about others?

Now she said she is sorry to E about the situation and how she doesn't understand how she was nasty. 

I hated the unjustice she created. Like she could escape with anyhing with just a mere sorry. She is sorry to be caught. 
I feel my friend E could gave up to her.

Am I the asshole to ask my friend to hold strong his position and in the first place to have aked him to uninvite her?

I feel like it's a petty blow and mequine but I see her parading like it's ok to be nasty. There would be no repercussion to any act.

Don't spare me but stay fair please. I am unsure I did the right thing. I feel some hatred to her and feel sorry to have put my friend in this position.

Thanks for the peer review.

Edit : I added that I am not usually violent but I snapped when she talked about the other guy. Sorry to seem violent. It's not the best way, I know."	No A-holes here	0	0	405.0	20.0	0.0	0.0
c1pa2m	2019-06-17 16:01:12	drbasilvondisco	AITA for telling my sister I don't want her daughter living with us?	"Hi all. 

Me and my husband Elliot have a a six month old baby, Matthew. For the past four months we have also had my 28 year old niece, Grace living with us. 

Grace is a banker working for one of the big investment banks. She initially worked in the branch in her home city, but as they wanted to further her career she transferred to the company's main base which is a commuting distance from our home. Although the company paid for her accommodation for the first few weeks, she was expected to sort something for herself since it was a permanent position. Although Grace earns a great salary and could easily afford a small place, my sister Claire begged me to let Grace stay at our place since she wanted her daughter to have a ''proper home''. I am only 10 years older than Grace and as such have always saw her as a little sister so I was happy to say yes. 

However, Claire and her husband David spoiled Grace when she was growing up and unfortunately Grace has not grown out of that mentality. She does not help out around the house and expects us to clean up after her in spite of the fact that we have a baby to care for. She expects us to cook for her and clean her room for her and is never grateful for any of this. In addition to this she has not grown out of her partying lifestyle and on most weekends goes out clubbing and returns in the early hours of the morning, and she makes no effort to be quiet which is a nightmare when we are trying to keep Matthew asleep. At times she has even brought random young men home with her which makes even more of a racket. 

Last night Claire phoned Grace and she was crying on the phone, saying that she hates it here and that we don't make her feel welcome. Claire then spoke to me and said that we should be a bit ''nicer'' to Grace. I then retorted saying that if Grace doesn't like the way we live, she's free to start looking for her own place. Claire was furious at that and went mental at me for being ''unfair'' to her daughter. 

I did not tell Grace to leave. All I suggested was that she either get used to being treated like an adult or find a place of her own, since we won't baby her like Claire and David do. 

Grace is at work and so is Elliot, but I'm wondering if I was a bit too harsh and maybe should have spoken to Grace before I dropped that on her?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1p81a	2019-06-17 15:56:48		AITA for rejecting my crush and calling her a coward?	"Last Summer, I asked out a coworker of mine, a really nice Native American girl. She said yes and we went on one date, but she ended up calling things off after the date before things got too serious between us. She explained that she still lives with her mom and her mom only wants her dating other Natives. She said that a relationship wouldn't work out as long as she's still under her mom's roof and that was that for us. And at work, I could tell that she was going out of her way to ignore me and not acknowledge me.

But a few months after that, she started acting all flirty with me and I texted her and asked her why she was acting like that. She said that she's decided that she still likes me and wants to give me another shot, but she's going to wait until she moves out of her mom's house to start dating. She explained that she was trying to enlist in our state's police academy (her dream is to be a cop) and that the academy salary is more than enough for her to live on her own. She asked me to wait for her and I foolishly agreed that I would wait until she's ready.

At work, we would talk and act flirty around one another, but her obstacle was that she was constantly failing the physical exam for the academy and that was delaying her entry. Still, I waited because I've never felt this way about one girl before and I really wanted to be with her. I've been waiting on her for nearly a year now and I found out last week that she's had a boyfriend for over a month. And yet, she would still continue to act all flirty with me while she had her boyfriend, so I confronted her about it last night.

I asked her why she was continuing to flirt with me despite having a boyfriend and she simply said that she's ""confused"" and that she likes both of us. She explained that her boyfriend is Native and that her mom set them up together. She said to me ""You're a great guy and you'd probably make a better boyfriend than my current one, but he's Native and I have to date him to make my mom happy."" At that point, I just called her a coward and berated her for being a 26 year old who still lives with mom and is afraid of standing up to her. I also told her that she should've told me that she had a boyfriend so that I can move on and not get my hopes up, but she said ""I like the attention you give me, though."" Again, I just called her a coward and left. There's a part of me that feels bad about what I said to her, but there's another part that feels good and it finally feels like I have massive weight lifted off of me."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1p80w	2019-06-17 15:56:46	TepidBrush	WIBTA if I send a slightly passive aggressive response back?	"So- we have neighbours who have kids and we all get on ok- occasionally seeing each other at social occasions and once they came to ours for brunch- we said we would take it in turns.  (I don’t know if this is relevant but she suggested we go out and I said I didn’t think  it would be a fun social event due to their two and our ones different nap times and eating and running around etc- so why not take it in turns. she agreed!)

We have a big family and actually have to schedule the rare ‘off day’ in our diaries because things book up so much! But we love seeing our friends and family.  This family is much more insular and don’t have good relationships with their families and their friends all live in the town they lived in before. 

3 days before ours, I texted her to confirm they were still on and to check for dietary requirements. We bought quite a lot of Prosecco (we figured we would use it some other time anyway!) but it ended up being quite boozy- and cost a fair bit. We booked another one in three months at theirs.

Now just over a week before I had mentioned I and baby had a cold. That was it. I didn’t hear from her till the day before the brunch to tell me she figured I was still ill so cancelled and her husband had a board meeting on Monday anyway. I can share screenshots if needed.  She suggested two dates so we picked one. Tbh I was annoyed she hadn’t texted to confirm anyway but whatever- I let it go and we managed to make some plans that kept us and baby happy!

Now it’s 6 six days before rescheduled brunch date- she’s cancelled again as they have some contracts to read through (they are starting a business) but apparently “will try to escape for ... birthday party” on Saturday - one of the neighbours kids birthday party- so she will probably see me then.

She’s a neighbour and also known for being very sensitive. 

WIBTA for writing something like this and then starting to create some distance- we have shared mums groups with other neighbours so I don’t want to argue but it’s not on!

Hey! Totally understand that you need to cancel. Maybe we should just stick to seeing if we are all free more last minute than booking a date in? As we tend to have plans most weekends, I don’t want to say no and miss out on other invites again as we have something in the calendar with you guys that gets cancelled again! hope it goes well xx

WIBTA? And if so, how shall I respond?

c1p5n6	2019-06-17 15:51:34	Francostein	AITA for not being willing to take down the wall of family portraits when I inherit my grandparents home	"My domestic partner requested that I make this post to gauge the opinion of uninvolved third parties. In the past few years, as my grandparents get on in age, they’ve been telling me, and now us, about how I stand to inherit their home once they decide to move into a retirement community or in the event of one of their deaths. Since we were all over for Father’s Day the subject came up once again. 

She and I are in agreement over one part, my mother expects that even once the home is in my name that it will continue to be the sole location for any and all family events; my partner and I have already agreed that we will set hard limits on which events we host and that it will not be the same type of open door policy to extended family. However, we came to a disagreement when discussing how we’d decorate one of the rooms. 

What my grandparents currently use as the living room is divided by a brick wall, and above the couch are nicely framed portraits and collages of our family, aunts, uncles, adopted siblings, myself and biological siblings, my grandparents family from where they emigrated, etc. As we’re discussing turning that living room into a recreation room she says, “We’re getting rid of all the pictures on the wall, right?” To which I replied, “Excuse me, you want me to put away all the pictures of my family?” Fortunately we have a very good rapport, that’s why I wanna marry her, but we were not seeing eye to eye on this issue. 

She is of the opinion that since she hasn’t met most of the people pictured that there’s no reason to have them up. I explained that my intention would be to rearrange the wall of portraits, adding photos of her family, our adventures as a couple and eventual family together. She persisted that she thought we should remove all the photos my grandparents have in the house and then populate it solely with photos of our own. I said that I would never dream of doing the same to the home her parents intend on willing to her so how could she expect me to do the same? Eventually we settled on the idea that if/when I inherit the home and pictures that we’ll only leave up the ones I’m “actually” related to.

He has been working 7 days a week, usually getting off between 1 and 3, but a lot of times later or he goes back up there late once it cools off to do more work. 

He is FINALLY supposed to have an entire day off on Wednesday and just called me to talk about how he wants to go up there to organize parts on his day off. I got upset saying then it wasnt a real day off. He told me he doesn't have time to do it on a regular work day but if its only going to take him an hour why couldnt it be done on any other day?

Edit: Update, we talked and he still wants to go up there but together this time and made a point to say hed help keep the kid entertained.

My friend and I would go on a long bike ride every Saturday, stopping for breakfast partway through. One Saturday we stopped at a well-known restaurant in a very upscale part of northern CA. The restaurant is in a beautiful location but is very isolated, as will be important to the story. We ordered breakfast and ate. The server brought us the bill, which came to a bit over 19$ -- lets say 19.17$ for the sake of the story though I forget the precise amount. Each of us had brought a couple of twenties for breakfast and incidentals, so we each put it a twenty. The server took the bill and both twenties and brought us back the 83 cents change and the unbroken twenty. So I asked her if she could break the twenty for us and she said ""Sorry but I cant do that"". I was embarassed but told her ""Look I am sorry but we need the twenty broken for the tip"", and again she told me ""I am not allowed to do that"". The restaurant shared a parking lot with a little gas station/general store, so i walked over there to try to get change but they did not open for an hour or so. There was no place else around for at least 5 miles to get change ( and we were on bicycles) so we left an 80 cent tip on a twenty buck bill.

As we were leaving she came out on the patio ( which had a bunch on diners on it) and yelled ""Thanks for not leaving a tip guys.""

So AITA? If it is important I am not afforded to leave a twenty buck tip on a 19 buck bill."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1p0av	2019-06-17 15:39:27	gruppyluppy	AITA for blowing up at my friend?	"This happened years ago, but recently I found out that my friend is still upset about it. So I wanna know if I’m the asshole here.

Years ago I was in a group of friends that was really close. There was me, Katie, Allison, and Derek. We hung out nearly every day.

Something happened between me and Katie after we started college together, and we had a huge falling out. She dropped out of college and moved back home, cutting off all contact with not only me, but also Derek and Allison. They were pretty hurt too, simply because she disappeared without a trace. However, I was the one in the worst shape from all of this, because Katie had been my best friend and although I actively disliked her for our falling out, I still missed her. Though Derek went to a different college, we remained close and texted all the time. He took my side after the falling out.

About a year went by. Allison and I rarely talked or saw each other, but we were still on good terms. Derek and I had remained close. Something else happened with Katie, where she called me out over social media and I couldn’t even see it because I was blocked. This reopened old wounds and I was venting to Derek about how sad/mad I was. He agreed that what Katie did was kinda shitty.

Then, one day I open Allison’s Snapchat story. It’s a picture of her, Katie, and Derek all hanging out. I was beyond hurt, especially because I’d been venting to Derek about Katie the other day. I thought the least he could’ve done was tell me that he and Katie had reconnected and were friends again. (I wasn’t that upset with Allison because we rarely spoke and I felt like she didn’t really have any loyalties with me, and therefore could do what she wanted.) I thought it was terrible that I had to find out that my old best friend group was hanging out without me from a Snapchat story. As it turns out, Katie and Derek had been friends for a long time, he just never told me. I gave him quite an earful about it.

As I said, this happened years ago and we’ve all moved past it. We’re all on good terms again, or so I thought. Recently I found out that apparently Derek is still mad at me for blowing up on him that one time. So, Reddit, was I the asshole in that situation?

INFO: When I say I blew up on Derek, I said things like “How could you, I thought we were friends, you really just let me cry on your shoulder about Katie only to go hang out with her behind my back, I bet you all were just laughing together about how hurt I was, yadda yadda yadda.” Typical dramatic teenager stuff. He just got defensive and told me that he was gonna tell me soon and that I shouldn’t be so mad.

INFO: Katie contacted Derek and Allison because she wanted to reconnect with all of us, but because I was the one who had the biggest falling out with her, she was scared to contact me. So she started being friends again with them first. At the time, I saw this as her trying to “steal” my friends from me. It was just a big misunderstanding. I forgave Derek long ago, and it took way longer for Katie and I to hash out all our issues, but I’ve since forgiven her too."	Not enough info	0	0	33.0	14.0	0.0	0.0

Now the bike doesn't have a fuel gauge and only a light that blinks when it's low on gas which didn't work at all this time. I've never had this problem before and the bike is pretty heavy (something around 200 kg) and I'm not the strongest person, even though I'm working on it. I called my family to see if they had any ideas on what I could do because the nearest gas station was 3 kilometres (~1.8 miles) from where I was and I just wanted to know if there was anything else I could do. I called my mum and she asked dad but all he said was that whatever happens to the bike is my problem and not his in a really hurtful kind of tone, to the point where I just instinctively hung up and began to cry before I eventually did have to push the thing all the way to the gas station. 


It's not the fact that they didn't help me, which I understand but I just felt so alone and unwanted and hurt in that moment like I have on several occasions when my dad has done stuff like this. He always calls me weak when I tell him I have trouble with the weight of the motorcycle, he's made fun of the fact that I go through a lot of soap but conveniently chooses to ignore the fact that I have a serious problem with touching things and people without washing my hands afterwards, he laughs off the things that my friends tell me saying that it's all untrue and they're all lying to me. It really hurts to have to hear all this while my mum just never takes a side on anything for some reason, especially when it's regarding this playful bully kind of behaviour by my dad. 


Up until today I was able to just shake it off but today was just different. It was like I couldn't take it anymore and I just got so mad at both of them. My parents have always provided for me and are good enough to let me live with them through college but these things my dad keeps saying really bothers me a lot and the two of them refuse to listen when I try to talk about it and I'm really conflicted about the way I'm feeling.

For various selfish reasons (which my dad now admits) he felt that he'd rather stay away until I was older and could come to him on my own.

Apparently this tore him up and he didn't want to keep placing me ""in the middle"".

Yesterday my brother and sister wished her a Happy Father's Day and my mom wrote individual messages to each one of them (group text).

My GF(25f) and I have a great relationship, I love her dearly and she is amazing and caring and all that I ever wanted. But at night she often is stricken with a deep sadness(she has never been diagnosed with anything so I'm not going to call it depression or anything) and more than anything she'll want me to make the half hour drive to her and comfort her, this usually will happen around the time I'm going to go to sleep and so very often when this happens I'm very tired and the times I can't muster the energy to go I fall asleep and this will upset her greatly and cause a fight. 

We don't live together atm because we can't afford it right now, but I'm hoping that once we do all these fights will stop happening.

"So I was going to my country of origin for a university entrance exam that was to be held on 23rd june via a transit flight with 1 hr stay at Bahrain Airport. When I got to the boarding pass counter at 23:40 (my flight was to depart at 12:45), the guy told me that my flight had been overbooked so I had to wait till they got around the problem. After every ten minutes or so, I kept reminding them that I existed but they remained vague in describing the problem and the possible solutions. Soon I realized it was just a delaying tactic to let my flight leave and then they'd tell me my options. Frustrated, I got a bit angry and finally they told me to go to the adjacent counter for a hotel. To be noted that when I had reached the area, it was deserted but now there was a long queue at that counter. I cut in the queue at the first place. When asked to get in the back by others in the queue, I refused and straight out said that I'd been waiting for about an hour.
AITA?

Edit: I had pre-booked the flight so I wasnt late or anything. But I get it, I was the asshole there. I had to wait wait another 30 mins till the line finished (rightly so now it seems)."	Asshole	0	0	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c1ovpr	2019-06-17 15:28:49	friendshipwoes3000	AITA for not finding my friend's mistake funny?	"I have a friend that lives in Boston (I live in the suburbs of CT), that I only get to see a few times a year. She’s the type that is “LOL quirky, aren’t I cute, not like other girls”. It can get annoying, but we do have a fun time when we’re together, so I visit her or vice versa. We were set to see a concert a couple of weekends ago, so I was going to stay at her apartment. I took the train into her city after work that Friday afternoon (the concert was Saturday). I was tired, hungry (she said not to eat because we’d get dinner together) and ready for a fun weekend. It’s about a 4 hour train ride.

When I got there, we walk several blocks to her apartment with my suitcase and halfway there she says “Imagine if I don’t have my keys and left them at work.” And laughs.

I ask “Do you want to check?”

She says they’re buried at the bottom of her bag, so I let it go and we keep walking. We finally get to her place and we find nope, she doesn’t have her keys. Roommates aren’t home or anything. She’s laughing and I’m not. She offers to let me sit there with my bags (I have my suitcase, my purse and a gift for her as it was recently her birthday) while she goes to her job (an hour there and back on the subway), but that’d just be awkward as there’s nowhere to sit and it’s clear that she doesn’t really want me to. So, off we go. It includes, a lot of walking. The whole way, she’s laughing and acting like this is so funny. I don’t find it. I probably wouldn’t have been so pissed, if she hadn’t texted me that she hadn’t done the same thing just a few nights prior. After that, you’d think she’d double check.

I’m sweaty, tired and starving by the time we get her keys. She’s trying to show me around her job and I’m just not in the mood. I try to do my best to be sociable, but eventually I ask if we can just head back or get a bite to eat as I haven’t eaten since lunch (it was pushing close to 8). She gets quiet and we leave.

Eventually, we’re back at her apartment and we order takeout. I give her, her present. She’s still quiet. I shower and when I get out, she tells me I embarrassed her. I tell her that she needs to be more responsible. She storms off to bed. The rest of the weekend, she refuses to talk about it and we managed to have an okay time, but I ended up changing my ticket to leave Saturday night rather than Sunday morning after the concert because it was clear she didn’t want me there (she refused to talk to me and when we met up with her parents-who I’m close with-she told them a warped one side of the story to make me embarrassed). We haven’t spoken since.

My husbands brother and mom came over and I was rude to my husbands brother like he is usually to me (didn’t say hi when I came in our house after work) and also told him to use a coaster for his drink (not in a nice way). Also didn’t really acknowledge him other than that. He looked super pissed and they left shortly after... without him saying bye or a simple thank you for letting them stay the night. I was super proud of myself for being rude back, but now I feel guilty because this is way out of character for me. Also, my husband wasn’t happy about my behavior.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I have been married for 10+ years and my wife's good female friend is an alcoholic. My wife is not an alcoholic but is a binge drinker when she goes out drinking. Her guard is down when drunk and between her and her friend there is very little responsibility taken because both can egg each other on.

&#x200B;

Years ago we went to visit her friend out of town and her friend brought back a man to her apartment after bar close. It was awkward.  The next year my wife went alone to visit her and I just found out the friend brought back a different man and ended up sleeping with him while my wife was there. My wife said she didn't do anything and left the next morning but it was uncomfortable to hear. The friend is since married and cheats on her husband.  She thinks her husband is an asshole (he is very controlling) but instead of working through it she resents him and goes out to have fun however she wants.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now. We have a few kids and my wife is stressed out a lot. I'd like her to do anything that helps relax her. Her friend wants to go to New Orleans on a girl's trip just the two of them and my wife is debating if she should go.  I don't try to be a controlling husband but based on the friend's past choices and my wife's inability to stop drinking when going out make me a bit uncomfortable. I don't think my wife would proactively cheat on me but I don't think her alcoholic friend who brings random men back would be a good influence on her, especially when she admittedly gets way too drunk.

&#x200B;

I don't mind if my wife hangs out with a group of friends (the majority have children, etc) but this one friend has made poor decisions in the past. I don't really want her to go but I'm not sure how to bring up these things without disparaging the friend. AITA if I tell her not to go on a trip with her promiscuous friend to New Orleans?

&#x200B;

EDIT - It's very interesting t o read half the comments saying it's right to honestly talk to my wife about my concerns about her friend and half saying I'm an asshole for caring about what her friends do.  Life has very diverse opinions."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1196.0	538.0	0.0	0.0

"I live in residential community that is out of the way from any adjacent residential communities, and not immediately near any commercial areas.  The main boulevard is about 1 mile long and all of the land adjacent to the boulevard is allowed to be used by everyone in the community and maintained and landscaped with our HOA dues.  Only residents/my neighbors and their guests can be the ones reasonably expected to be using the area along this boulevard to walk their dogs.
I have a large dog, and have always cleaned up after him because I don't want him to be a problem for anyone else.  Others aren't so considerate and let their dogs large and small do their business and leave it for everyone else to deal with.  I have run out of bags before, so I get that happens, but the community also provides bags in multiple areas where ""problem areas"" have been noted.  Sometimes the poop can't be picked up and I understand that too, but it should be covered w/ mulch or leaves or something so no one else's dog can come into direct contact with it.
Since providing the bags isn't completely taking care of the problem, my husband and I bought orange flags and write on them to shame the dog owners who leave their dog's poop for everyone else to dodge.  My dog has been to the vet for bacterial infections at least 4-5 times in the last few years and the vet says it's from him coming into contact with other dogs' poop.  Some of my flags have said ""clean it up or pay my vet bills.""  And if I could pinpoint the offenders, I would absolutely hold them to it.

c1op9m	2019-06-17 15:13:55	assholemenstruating	AITA for not telling my neighbours that their daughter got her first period?	"I (22M) live next door to a lovely family with 3 girls aged 13, 9ish and 6. We get along adequately considering I'm a bit of a hermit, they'll occasionally invite me over for dinner and I let them use my spa (hot tub?) whenever they want. Recently they asked if I would be OK acting as a semi-absent babysitter for the girls over the weekend, as they were going on their first trip leaving them home alone for one night (they are a bit young for that though right?). I of course said no problem, and even said I would go over and check on them overnight to make sure they hadn't vanished. Everything is set up, phone numbers, medical information, a will (just in case) and off they went Saturday morning.

&#x200B;

Nothing of note happens until 4pm rolls around and I get a knock at the door. I was fully expecting to have to go turn the oven on for them or something, but standing there is the oldest girl looking more pale than bucket of water. This scared the shit out of me because last I checked she was a friendly Malaysian and not a friendly ghost. Immediately she softly said she had started her period. Now I'm no mathematician but even I deduced that this was new territory for her since she's asking me, a 22 year old dude for help with her hoo-ha.

&#x200B;

My immediate though is to A. call her parents and B. call her parents. I guess I'm a sucker though because she asked me not too and said she would tell them when they got home, and I listened to her. All she asked was if I could go and buy the goods, and she knew what to do with them. Ordinarily, I would tell her to go to hell and to drive herself, but I decided against that approach this one time.

&#x200B;

At the store the nice gal working their helped me pick out a variety of pads, I decided against tampons for obvious reasons I hope, and grabbed some chocolate for all three girls as a gift and headed home.  When I got back she whizzed into the bathroom to install the hardware (or is it software?). I made sure she knew what was going on, offered to print some pamphlets off if she wanted like I'm a teacher or something, and left after she assured me she was fine to heat up dinner and go about her day.

&#x200B;

Everything went well over night and my neighbours came home in the morning and were promptly filled in on everything by their kids and I gave praise to their behaviour and so forth. Everything's good right? Wrong! My neighbours have spoken to me and think I am wrong for not phoning them to let them know their daughter had started her period. I feel they are incorrect, and I am just following the wishes of the period-haver and if she wanted them to know sooner she would have called them herself or at least not asked me to not tell them.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I was babysitting my neighbour's kids and their 13 year old got her first period. She asked me not to tell her parents so I didn't and they think I should've told them. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

In college, I had a group of friends that included 2 females, both M & G. We all got along great. M graduated the year before G and I but would come to visit often. M and G were in the same sorority and M would often stay in said sorority's house when visiting. During one of the visits, in the middle of G and I's senior year, M came to visit and had an encounter with friends while G was there and felt that G didn't stand up for and left in anger and ended up sleeping on my couch that night. From this point on, M is no longer friends with G. This happened, roughly, February 2013. 

I remain friends with both. G and I both graduate spring 2013.

Following graduation, and for the next several years, I go abroad to teach English. M and I communicate weekly (emails, Skype, etc) and become even better friends than we were in college. When I would come I would go and visit her. 

When I was abroad, communicating with G was like pulling teeth. Just very hard to do and would maybe hear from her once a month. But when I would come home we managed to meet up as well, so I felt good about it. 

Jan. 2017 I'm now home for good. Talking to both roughly the same amount while abroad (frequently with M, sparse with G). During that year I make trips to see both. Following the trip, I begin to speak to G more. Summer of 2017, M becomes engaged. 

Jan 2018. Me and G decide to try to date. We both live pretty far apart so we knew it would be difficult but we starting planning trips and ended up seeing each other quite a few times. When we decided to try to date, we didnt advertise this to people for a few reasons, so I didn't go out of my way to hide it from M. Last June, G and I go to two separate weddings together as dates. Pictures were shared online and M found out and then asked why she was my date. I said we were dating. I dont hear from M for 2 months. 

During those 2 months, many of my friends receive their Save the Dates for M's wedding. I knew it was in September but never knew the exact date. G and I are able to plan a weekend for her to come down to visit me in September. 

Middle of August I receive my invitation. Turns out her wedding was the same day as the weekend G would be coming down to visit. Taking G as my plus one was never an option for me. I send back the RSVP declining and write a small note on the back apologizing. 

Few days later I get a message from M exploding on me because I'm not coming to her wedding. She then goes off about G and that it was selfish of me to not come to her wedding. I try to apologize and even try calling her, but she then proceeds to block me on FB and others and then ignores all my messages. 

G comes down and we have a great time. I dont tell her about M or the wedding because I didnt want her to feel like it was her fault (and I don't believe it is. I don't hold any grudge against G).

Today my best friend and I are going to go down to a swimming hole and I’ll just say in Austin, TX (for traffic purposes). I currently live 10 minutes from this place (north of me) and my best friend lives 10 minutes south of me.

Now, my best friend knows that I can’t be in traffic for too long because I start to get anxiety and panic attacks, but I told her that I’d be willing to drive from my place to swimming hole and back. However, she texted me today telling me to go pick her up from her place so we could go to the swimming hole. I usually don’t mind this, but again, I haven’t been feeling like myself while driving especially in traffic. 

If I were to go and pick her I would need to go 10 min south and then it’ll be 20 minutes north to get to the swimming hole. However, after we are done she wants to go and do stuff which of course I am driving and using up my gas. Not only that, but I’m going to have to drive the 20 minutes back to her place, drop her off, and then come back the 10 minutes to my apartment. 

Again, I usually don’t say no to this, but with the panic attacks and bad anxiety I don’t think I could do. 

So, WIBTA if I told her no to picking her up?

They’re located in Ecuador, right on the equator. I am from the United States. He has a green card and we just spend $15,000 on a lawyer to get his legal status. I am 20 years old and that was my life savings, I’m not just some rich kid who was able to easily foot this lawyer bill. Luckily the green card allows him to work legally and he has started working and helping paying bills. (He was dishwashing under the table for $4 an hour 14 hours a day. We had an ER bill from his hands being in chemicals all day and his skin was peeling off to a concerning degree. I told him I’d rather work for the two of us instead of him trying for pennies on the dollar and hurting himself) 

We just got the green card. He’s 19, so a year younger than me. He wasn’t legally allowed to see his family because if he left the United States he wouldn’t be able to come back during his change of status. It has been a year and a half he hasn’t seen his family, which understandably is a long time for a 19 year old. 
He booked a plane ticket without asking me first and right now he’s in Ecuador spending time with them. We had a BIG conversation about him buying the ticket without consulting me first, and he promised to never do it again. We have joint checking and savings so I want to plan for these things. 

He’s there and he told me he wants me to come visit his family with him over Christmas time. First off, I love his family and my sweet husband. They’re amazing people. But it’s the heat. I can’t do it. Last time I visited (a year and a half ago) I stayed for 7 days. They don’t have air conditioning and the average daily temp is around 105 degrees. I’m not just some white girl saying “ugh I can’t go because there’s no air conditioning.” I went last time, completely aware of this, thinking I could handle the heat. I ended up getting really really sick. It was 105 degrees, no AC, I constantly felt like i was going to pass out; I was in their only bathroom 75% of my stay, puking, shitting, and staying in the cold shower because it was the only way I could cool myself off. I made their entire apartment smell like my shit and vomit. Then when someone else had to use the bathroom it stunk awful from me. I honestly don’t think my body can handle being that hot for that long, plus the added embarrassment....

He said we could buy them an air conditioner so we could stay, but that’s another expense we really can’t afford.

I don’t know what to do. To bring them here on a visitors visa we would be looking at about a $6,000 expense for three people. 

Then I tell my husband he can’t spend Christmas with his family? I have no family, he’s all I have. So I could let him go, and stay home alone again? 

I don’t know what to do, i guess i have a choice to make.

I posted something similar to this a couple days ago, so some of this may look familiar.
My roommate and his gf got a dog together. Without asking me if I was okay with it. Im not sure the landlord even gave them the “okay” to do that. That all being said, I have already put in my written notice that Im leaving and asked for my security deposit back.

They are not good dog owners. The girlfriend, refers to the dog as her own but refuses to care for it in any way and also didn’t even pay for it, sign for it, etc.
My roommate, doesn’t take the dog out because he “forgets”. So, the dog soils the carpet pretty regularly and I am left to clean up after it. They will go out of town for the whole day, leaving the dog alone. The dog is a BIG dog, btw. I have also seen him hit and kick the dog when it does wrong.
Finally, I yelled at both of them. The girlfriend got high and mighty and said the dog isn’t hers, and will never be hers, so its not her problem. She then laughed at me and said “imagine thinking that someone else’s pet isn’t your responsibility”. Word for word. She said that I need to grow up and teach the dog right from wrong, and clean up when it makes a mess. The boyfriend was relatively apologetic, but tried to sweep it under the rug because he doesn’t like confrontation.
So I said “then i am not going to clean up, take out, or train a dog that is not, and will never me mine”. The girlfriend said I might as well move out if I dont like the dog. I guess they still haven’t gotten the message. A mutual friend thinks I was too harsh for saying that, and that I should still at least take the dog out. I understand that I can’t blame the dog. Im not mad at the dog, Im mad at them for being irresponsible. I don’t want to leave the dog in its own filth, but Im mad that I’ve been late to my own responsibilities and commitments because I’ve have to pick up after a dog that is not mine.

I had my eldest daughter at 16 with my high school girlfriend who was 19. I wanted to have a family anf yes, I was really dumb.

We  got married really young, but we got divorced because I found out that she was sleeping another man who was much older. He had the money, I was not financially secure. She got custody and I got visitation. This continued for a while, but he had the money to pamper my daughter and my finances were not that great. By the time she was 14, idk what happened, but my daughter opted for optional visitation. It simply meant that I could only see her if she wanted to see me. That never happened. 

Around that time, I was just starting to do well for myself and I decided to move away because I could no longer take it. I had to accept the fact that she didn't want to see. I tried to contact my ex for information and pictures but I was simply told that I was infringing on their privacy. Eventually I gave up and I moved on.

I just understood that I had to be financially strong. I concentrated on my real estate business that and I did really well for myself. It's been years now and I'm really happy. I own a very successful real estate firm and I'm married now with a daughter. I owe everything to my wife and my best friend who were really supportive. 

When my eldest daughter was starting college, my ex contacted me and told me that she was divorced. She asked me if I would help with my daughter's college expenses. I gladly helped because I no longer had any financial woes. I also gave her a graduation present ( a lump sum to get her started ). 

So she surprised me with a party yesterday. And she was there. She's 25 now. 25. We had a chat. She apparently missed me so much. She was sorry and she never knew that the money came from me. I call bullshit on that. I told her it was not an attempt to reconcile and I was only doing my duty and walked out. 

Wife tells me that my daughter deserved a chance and I had to take the high road. But it's just too much for me. It's beyond repair and serves no purpose. AITA here.

Edit: Someone messaged me asking to mention when my daughter graduated. She graduated when she was 22.

Edit2: This is not about my daughter wanting money from me. And I personally don't think that she's only doing this because I'm well off now, because my firm is well known where I live and it's not a secret she just stumbled upon. It's just that I've missed her ENTIRE CHILDHOOD. What is there to do now. I have no memories with my daughter. And I don't know if it changes much now.

c1ojed	2019-06-17 15:00:22	Rebirthwolfx	AITA For not caring about my depressive dad?	"A bit of background context, my mom retired from work pretty early on to take care of me and my brother, when we were 9. Before that, my Brother and I were left on our own, often taken care at a kindergarten or by a caregiver. My dad continue being the bread winner, working at my grandfather’s workshop. Now my dad and my mom never loved each other, in fact, my dad is gay and I found out by accident when he was babysitting us and I saw him watching gay porn. 

I’m pretty sure my mom knows this but she chooses to stay in the family because of monetary reasons, but that’s a whole other story for another time. My dad and mom would always get into heated arguments every single night, that literally all our family gatherings was awkward as hell. I hated going out as a family and I always thought that love is a figure of speech and a it’s just way to get money. My dad was always distant, never coming to my school events and pretty much caring only about himself. He cheats on my mom every month, going overseas for meetings. I found this out when I was snooping around his phone and I was crushed by this. How could this person be my dad?

Now, my dad has depression. He burnt his hand playing stocks and lost a lot of money in the process, causing my Grandfather to step in to keep my family afloat. However, from then on, every year he gets depressed in the months of March to October. He gets extremely clingy, desperate for attention and every night he wakes up our entire family with his crying. Initially my family consoles him whenever we could and bringing him to the doctor, but when he gets out of his depression, he goes back to becoming distant and aggressive.  And the most infuriating thing is that he didn’t learn his lesson and goes back to playing stocks, wasting more of our family’s money. This has gone for 10 consecutive years and he’s depressed again just as I’m back for the holidays. 

I’m sick and tired of this. I know depression requires a lot of help and trust by loved ones, but I never felt loved by him.

*TL;DR* Dad is gay, cheats and he gets depressed every year but I’m sick of it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	54.0	34.0	0.0	0.0

She was on the original lease for the rental, but a new lease was issued earlier this year that she didn't sign. She broke up with me for not being social (which is fair) and we've had a mostly amicable relationship for the past two months. She is moving to a different state in around three months

The sticking points for me are that 1) she lives in the large bedroom while I live in a cramped office with a couch to sleep on, 2) she uses the majority of the household expenses and is benefiting from my **heavily** discounted rent ($500 for a $1000+ unit), and 3) her new boyfriend (~30M) is over almost every day and night, which makes me uncomfortable

To be fair to her, she is nice and very accommodating to me and has taken steps to ensure that I rarely see the other guy, and it's as much her house as mine and she would have to move into a much worse / more expensive place on her limited finances. I also believe that she intends on keeping me as a close friend and may take steps not to jeopardize that

I asked her to ""think about moving out"" and then that ""I'd like her to move out"", but I don't think she has any plan to until she leaves the state in three months. I don't want to be stuck in my current position for that long as it's affecting my mental health and perceived ability to make new friends (I have none)

I plan on serving her a 30-day eviction notice (which I believe is my right) in order to get the ball rolling on her moving out. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1odws	2019-06-17 14:47:08	bonercollexor	AITA for possibly cutting a planned vacation short?	"I’ll try to keep this simple. 

I’ve known for about three or four months that my husband and I are planning on spending the week of July 4th in Miami with his family for the holiday. While we are down there, we are also going to inter his fathers ashes. (His dad has been gone since 2015, his mom was just now able to find a place for him). The problem is, when I was supposed to put in for the time off three or four months ago, I fell and sprained my ankle/foot so badly it was almost broken and missed nearly two weeks of work because of it. My boss was pissed that I missed so many days, and I was terrified that I would lose my job if I asked for an entire week off so soon afterward, no matter how far off it was. 

I’ve only recently felt secure enough at work to ask for the time, but when I did, my boss pitched a fit and told everyone that they need to put in their time off requests at the same time that day. I didn’t, because I’d already spoken to him about it and I guess I thought that would “already count”. I also made it very clear that the point of this trip was to take care of my father in law. 

Well, that was last week. I just checked with my manager (my boss’s sister) if my time off was on the list. She told me that it isn’t, despite me asking a week ago. 

The problem this has caused is that since I put in, a *lot* of other people have put in for that time as well, and now I may not get the time at all. 

I just got off the phone with my husband, telling him all of this. I told him that if I have to miss the holiday, so be it, the important thing is being there for his dad, and I can make the (~8 hour) drive early the same day and then head right back afterwards. I thought that, while not ideal, this would at least work because the biggest reason for this trip was to take care of his father. But he’s upset because I’ll miss the holiday with the rest of his family, and because I waited too long to ask for the time off. I tried to explain to him that, “when you’re terrified of being fired, you do as little as possible to piss them off,” but he wasn’t having it. 

I acknowledge that I should have put the time in sooner, but there’s nothing we can do about that now. I can still make it for his dads interment, and I feel like that’s the most important thing. He disagrees and is threatening to come to my workplace and have words with my boss over it, and if that doesn’t work, he wants me to quit. 

I understand how important family is, truly, but this is my very first job in my field after getting out of school, and it’s a damn good job with the best pay in this field in the area. We also just bought a house and have to consider our mortgage, which we will struggle to pay with only one income. I’m a nail tech, and as ludicrous as it sounds, it’s hard to get hired as a white girl when literally all of the salons in our area are Asian-owned.

c1odbj	2019-06-17 14:45:47	Jiggym12	AITA for including an inside joke about my friend/coworker on a power point presentation to our regional manager?	"Using a throwaway since my reg account has mentions of my hometown and employer. 

I have a long running prank war with a girl I really like in my office. We are both happily married but she and I have a very strong vibe that probably borders on flirty. But we also have clear boundaries so there’s no issues. 

I had to give a PPT to our regional manager on Friday. On Monday that week she had pranked me big time locking her old iPhone in my desk with it playing “I ran” by flock of seagulls on low volume repeat. She even swapped the lock tumbler out with one from her desk so it was actually very clever and I just had to endure until the battery wore out.

So my way of getting back to her was taking a photo of her working at her desk as a sort of “stock photo,” I added it to a slide and did the following bullet points

Always (work related jibberish)

Mention ....

Buying/selling ...

Everyone ...

Regular ...

Steady ...

Bargain/not bargain ?

Industry ...

Gains ...

Timing ...

Innovation ...

Taking the initiative....

c1od96	2019-06-17 14:45:38	supergirlspanties	WIBTA if I'm not the best man?	"Back in high school, a close friend of mine (perhaps my best friend at the time) and I split up- I went to college and he had two children.

His baby momma eventually screwed him out of custody, and after years of blackout silence from him, he resurfaced again trying to maintain our friendship. By then, I had come out as transgender, and become a pioneer for distance skateboarding. My life reflected 0% of what it was before, and as a result, it never occurred to me to catch up with him. He always said he was content living on section 8 and collecting food stamps as long as he could always drink and smoke - and while that was much of how I felt in and around high school, I had a new lease on life he wasn't even aware of.

I spent a long time dodging him because if I was ever back in town, it was typically for a specific reason. I never went back to town unless I had to, and it wasn't to hang out. Too much of a past life I didn't live happened there and I hated it. Eventually I did end up going back, and in that time he made no effort to visit me or make plans. There was one time when I offered to pay for a full tank of gas so he could come and he still didn't. There was no reason for him to expect I'd visit him, because I had no car of my own, so I felt the onus was on him to come hang out.

That never happened, and I left my home state again for another undefined amount of time. We never kept up and only interacted on facebook. I pretty genuinely realized that times just changed and I couldn't find a connection to maintain the relationship, but then my dad died. His death once again brought me back to my home state, and he came to the funeral. He introduced me to his new girlfriend I had seen on Facebook, and I gave him a hug. I was pretty overwhelmed overall and didn't have any drive in me to maintain conversation with anyone. I very much just wanted to disappear that day.

After the funeral, he texted me online to inform me that he was going to ask his new girlfriend to marry him. I congratulated him, but then he asked me to be his best man. Keep in mind that in the ~10 years since high school, I revealed myself as a woman to the world. I didn't call him out for it, but it was pretty glaringly disrespectful in general. I told him to let me know when the wedding was, and I'd get back to him.

That was a few months ago. Haven't heard from him since until yesterday, where he asked what I was planning as his best man. I left him on ""seen"" and haven't figured out what to reply. I don't know how to be a best man, and I honestly don't know him well enough any more to even be a part of the wedding.

c1obkr	2019-06-17 14:41:54	spiffy_krypton	AITA for thinking you can always refuse to pick up extra shifts?	"My boyfriend and I have academic jobs, so during the summers we usually both have to find a side job to help cover bills. The pay for academia ends in the summer, but if you want to stay on top of things, your workload does not. I’d say we both do at least 30 hours of work a week on school-related stuff at home during the summer.

This summer, I had enough savings to allow me to not have to work a second job. He didn’t. He took a job at a casual restaurant and asked for no more than 24 hours a week, explaining his summer situation and how much work he had from school. They agreed to this and hired him.

Of course he ends up usually doing closer to 32 each week, but he’s not too bothered by it. He’s managing his workload fine, but he’s exhausted, understandably. I think it’s unfair that they promised 24 hours and add in the extra, but whatever.

Here’s where we disagree the most. At least 3 times a week, on almost every single day he happens to get off, one of his managers asks him to come in and cover a shift. He gets very anxious about these requests because he feels obligated to do at least one or two of them.

My position is that no one should have to accept an extra shift for any reason, ever. If you weren’t scheduled, it’s your day off, and you should never feel bad about it or be made to feel bad about it. I almost can’t understand his anxiety about it—you weren’t scheduled, that’s the end of it, period. You can just write back and say “sorry, no.” He says that’s dick-ish. Is it, though? Am I missing some work etiquette and he’s got it right?

He himself never calls off, if that matters at all. No one is picking up *his* scheduled shifts.

I’m just curious about the general consensus on picking up extra shifts, I guess.

EDIT: Just wanted to say I wasn’t expecting so many responses, especially so many confirming my position that days off DO belong to employees and there’s never any obligation to pick up an unscheduled shift, let alone picking up 1 or 2 shifts *every single week*, and confirming my suspicions that his managers are indeed taking advantage of his anxiety over saying no along with his good work ethic and helpful demeanor. I wish my boyfriend understood that it’s his right, and really his responsibility to himself, to set proper and fair professional boundaries, and that he’s ultimately doing himself a disservice by responding to all of these texts and calls."

c1objz	2019-06-17 14:41:50	barefootwood	AITA for wanting to continue attending a Boy Scout camp?	"First post here, I’ll try to be as objective as possible.  

There’s a Boy Scout camp I’ve attended and worked at for the passed 15 years (starting 2004)  and it’s a big thing in my family (my brothers and father also attend for similar lengths).  It’s the most time we all get to see each other over the year.   It requires ten days away (3 for set up, 7 days with campers).   I’ve now moved up to bigger things within the camp, dealing with medical things (first aid, meds, etc).  

I met my wife in 2010.  We didn’t start dating until 2013.   She has had an issue with me going to camp ever since we started dating.  The first couple years I went for all ten days, but the passed 3 years I’ve cut it down so I’m only there for maybe 4-5 days (as I can’t get the time off from work anymore, plus I don’t want to use ALL of my vacation time for camp.  I enjoy taking vacations with my wife as well).  She says it’s a vacation away from her and unfair as she doesn’t have anything like it in her life.  That it’s the only thing I show passion for in my life.  It’s volunteer so I ‘don’t get anything out of it and it doesn’t help us grow (as a couple) so why do you do it’.  My argument is that I’ve been doing this for years, it’s time with my family, and I’m helping young scouts.  Since I’ve been going for so long, I’ve moved up and am leaned on to help make major decisions for camp (am part of the ‘inner circle’ of older/seasoned camp staff).  We have monthly meetings via phone/GoToMeeting (which I’ve skipped almost every one this year so to spend time with her).  Me not attending the meetings or camp is not going to result in camp crumbling.  The previous camp Director retired and we spent two years making sure camp would continue.  

Her side:
I am currently working on applying to and going to PA school (physicians assistant).  I am retaking some classes to boost my gpa and show I’m a good candidate.  She says camp takes away from my focus on my career and our future (as I’d be the breadwinner for the family, a decision I’ve been fine with).  Since it is volunteer, I am not paid so it is money out of our pockets.   She does have anxiety and hates sleeping by herself at night.  We do live in a quiet part of a small New England city, so it’s generally safe (though you never know what happens).  While at camp I call every morning and night to say hi and text throughout the day to see how life is going and make her feel like she isn’t forgotten and I’m just trying to get away from here.  

So am I the asshole for wanting to continue attending this camp?

I can post more info if needed, my first time posting and am at work so sorry for any typos or missing info

Edit: In rereading my post I made it look like she thinks I’m trying to get away from her.  It’s more like I get to go away while she stays and has to work while I’m ‘off in the woods’

Edit 2: in responding to another post, she did have a BF in college who went away for his own camp which was all summer (like 8-9weeks) who would rarely call or text her, or even leave on the weekend between sessions to go see her.  So she does have some bad experience with camps"	Not the A-hole	0	0	349.0	164.0	0.0	0.0
c1ob8g	2019-06-17 14:41:08	Common_Concentrate	AITA for finding my best friend annoying now that she's gotten healthy?	Me and my best friend have been so close for years, all through school we've always been together and I trust her with anything, she helped me through some really bad times. Recently we both realised we were quite unhealthy and needed to change our lifestyles a bit. We both consistently started doing exercise and eating better, and lost a good deal of weight and felt better about ourselves. It was quite fun at first but then she started taking it ridiculously seriously, doing a lot of high intensity exercise every day and being careful about what she's eating (just adding that it's not enough to have any sort of problem). I do less than her (not as restrictive with food, and doing less exercise), but still enough to be in shape. I'm quite proud of her but honestly, she's not the same anymore, she's irritatingly healthy and honestly won't talk about anything else but her exercise routine and what healthy food she ate last night. I used to absolutely love her company but now it just seems dull. Furthermore, she won't stop complaining, especially about what she needs to change, and how her stomach isn't flat enough, her legs are too thick, ect (like I said before, not enough to have a problem, she just keeps complaining about it). She won't eat anything unhealthy and just keeps going on about how once you stop eating certain things you realise how bad they are for you, and I know how petty this sounds but it's just really irritating. I love her more than anything but I feel like she's not the same anymore. Does it make me a bad person for liking her more when she wasn't so healthy? I know that asides from smaller insecurities she's very happy with her new lifestyle, and feels a lot better, but I don't know what I can do, if anything. I don't want to push her back into her previous lifestyle, but she annoys me a lot now. I'd never want to end our friendship over something so stupid, but I just like her less now that she's healthier. Am I overreacting here and being a bad friend?	No A-holes here	0	0	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

He shouted at us for talking over the TV, didn’t lift a single finger to help C, was rude, didn’t talk to anyone and kept making snide comments about my fiancé and his brothers (all 3 of them has Aspergers, are partially sighted and have dyslexia and dyspraxia). Later we took R (the youngest of the boys) out for his 18th birthday. DH tagged along uninvited, demanded we eat at a certain restaurant, was rude about R’s new job, my fiancé’s speech impediment and a whole load of other stuff. He then expected US to pay for his meal as we were paying for C and R. He laughed at how excited R was about the (quite expensive) watch we got for his 18, and lost his shit like a huge baby when my fiancé turned off the telly as he couldn’t hear his mum talking. My fiancé spilt his drink and DH yells that he is an idiot E.C.T. I gotta admit I lost my shit here too, as my fiancé was clearly hurting and told him that if he does one more thing, just one, to upset anyone, that I would beat the ever living shit out of him. I meant it too. 

As a result he isn’t permitted into my house, nor will I stay anywhere he is also staying. As my fiancé is partially sighted he needs me to take him places. His mum refuses to travel alone so it means he doesn’t get to see her very often. She has stayed at our house alone before and I am more than happy to drive the 6 hours to visit her, and to have her stay with us, but not her BF. Am I being the asshole here?"

c1oae2	2019-06-17 14:39:06		AITA for being annoyed that my cashback rewards were stealthily used to slightly subsidize my friend's expenses?	I have a decent cashback card that gives me 4% back on dining expenses.  It's currently better than what my friends have and I've encouraged them to consider getting the card for themselves.  Because my card yields the best rewards of the group, they encourage me to pay for our meals whenever we get together, with them paying me back through Venmo or through a balancing of expenses owed through Splitwise.  Yesterday, I was asked to join a larger group for an expensive Brunch.  I paid the bill approaching $500 and that was that.  Later, I was texted an itemized breakdown of how much each person in our group owed me by the guy who insisted on managing that particular afternoon's invoicing.  In the message, he stated that he lowered the amount people owed me by 2%, it turns out, because he had applied for my cashback card but was denied.  I wouldn't be absorbing these large group expenses if I was to be getting the same cashback as everyone else.  Am I an asshole here?		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1o9dq	2019-06-17 14:36:32		AITA for being upset that my girlfriend wants to be friends with people she sent nudes to in the past while dating me?	"For some context, we've been dating for a year and a half (M22) (F18). We've both cheated in the past and moved on/came to terms with it (it was a year ago that I did once as well as her.) I can safely say that we both matured a lot going through that situation because we agreed we wanted each other. It's also important to note however that she had cheated in the past with other people, which she said was during short periods we had half-broken up, one of which was her prom date (we were together when they went to prom but they had sex a few months after.) She also lied about the situations and kept them secret until I could talk with her to actually open up and be more honest with me. I've had a lot of patience (and have grown a lot in doing so) trying to understand her perspective on wanting to have friends, however she has specifically added boys numerous times whom she previously sent explicit pictures of her (which I took for one of them which was even more upsetting) and every time she says she just wants to be friends now. 

I can understand wanting and needing friendships, because she says she doesn't have any good ones/people to open up to, but it feels very disrespectful of her to choose *those* people in specific to be her friends. Furthermore, she's had friends in the past whom she vehemently defended their legitimacy as a friend, only to later reveal to me that wasn't the case. I can't tell if I'm being an impatient asshole by not understanding her need for friendship, regardless of where it needs to come from (because her main point is that mature people can still be friends regardless of them being exes/past things) however my main point is that while exes can be friends, it's a totally different set of rules for friends who you did cheaty things with in this relationship. Am I wrong for having expectations in my moral compass that she doesn't have? We've agreed that we atleast have differing compasses and aren't sure where to go from here.

&#x200B;

TL;DR  girlfriend re-friends boys she sent explicit photos/sexted while dating me, says I'm the asshole for not being mature enough to handle friends with previous histories and implies that my moral compass is too conservative for not allowing those friendships"	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1o5b4	2019-06-17 14:26:45	BlameTheSociety	AITA for getting my stepsister kicked out of a conference?	"Not sure the title fits, couldn't think of something better.

My stepsister(18) was asked to give a talk at an autism conference kinda thing, and I talked to one of the organizers and let her know that I was uncomfortable with this decision as my stepsister was planning to just advertise her book in her talk, which is essentially about ""the hardship of growing up as the sister of an autistic child"", which I find inappropriate and insulting. As a result, my stepsister was asked to step down. Now my family is livid at me.

&#x200B;

I am all for advocating the struggles of the left-out siblings,  and their voices need to be heard. But my stepsister is flat-out lying about her experience, which doesn't sit well with me.

I was diagnosed as on the spectrum in my childhood, but found the diagnosis to be virtually irrelevant later in life. I rarely let people know about it, and nobody has ever suspected I could be autistic. My parents divorced about 5 years ago, and my father remarried quickly after. So when I met my stepsister for the first time, she was 13 and I was 20. We are not close at all, and I am not close to my father. We never lived together. We only saw each other a handful of times in the previous years, only for a few hours at a time. I tried to bond with her initially, but she wouldn't shut up about how ""crazy"" I was and how strange it was for her to know somebody with autism. She compared being autistic to being a serial killer and all that fun. My father is an a-hole, so she undoubtedly got that from him. I didn't blame her, but stayed distant after I realised that her weird fascination with my ""craziness"" didn't lessen as she grew older. She kept telling me that she wanted to become a therapist to ""help people like me live a good life"".

Last month, my father let me know that she was publishing her first book. On autism.  He was incredibly proud of her accomplishment and told me how she wanted to give a talk about it at a conference, to ""reach the right audience and give expert advise based on first hand experience"". I thought it was a joke at first. When I found out it wasn't, I was horrified and finally decided to talk to the organizers of the conference, after all attempts at talking to stepsister failed.

I tried to be nice about it; I didn't want to come out and be like ""hey she's a fraud and full of bullshit"", so I worded it carefully, something along the lines of ""I'm uncomfortable about my stepsister using me as a reference in her book, as I don't agree with some of her points and fear that the audience would take offense."" The decision to ask my stepsister to not speak was not made by me.

To be clear: the book is all about her, whining about how hard life is when you have a ""mentally ill"" sister, and how hard it is to cope. It's complete fiction, save for the fact that she's clearly referencing me as the sister throughout.

My family is now mad at me, even my mother (who hates my father and his new family) says it was wrong of me to talk to the organizers. AITA?

c1o3lc	2019-06-17 14:22:33	Thyperson08	AITA for being mad at a friend for not warning me about a long bike ride he invited me to.	"A friend of mine invited me to go on a bike ride with him. He didn't seem to imply that it was a long or difficult one considering he didn't bring water with us or gave me any details about it (I also didn't inquire for many details). At first I told him that I had plans at 2 to play volleyball, like I do every weekend and he is well aware of this because he comes or meets me there sometimes. When we left his place he didn't grab any water or provisions besides a sandwich, so I thought it must be a short ride then. This ride turned out to be 45-50 miles long and last 6 hours. No water, no sunscreen, I was wearing jeans. My face and arms got pretty sunburned, playing volleyball was right out because I was already 4 hours late by the time I got home.

To be fair he asked me if I needed to stop to my car for anything. For any long ride I would have my backpack with water, sunscreen and and other just in case things. I would also wear proper clothing considering that we live in LA and it's summer. Like I said, he never implied that this would be a long or difficult ride and he didn't bring water so I declined. Plus I would be ok with a 2-3 hour ride without these things. 

I decided to ditch the ride when we got to an area where I could finally take off by myself after 5 hours of not having any idea how to get home. An hour and a half after he texts, me saying the ride is over. So I told him that I had to ask why he didn't tell me the ride would be like that. His response was ""This ride is random. When you hang out with me, it's a risk you have to take. I take the risk the same with you."" He also said I should have asked him details. Well how can I do that if you already said that it was random? I'm thoroughly convinced that he knows these rides go on for several hours like this and is full of shit.

Needless to say, I'm quite pissed off at him for putting me in harm's way (no water, no sunscreen, improper attire), by not telling me a ride could go that long with them, not acknowledging that he made a mistake or even apologizing for what happened. He did offer to get a beer or two to chill out after but I was already home by that time, irritated about getting burned, missing my weekly plans and I didn't want to go anywhere after that BS.

I talked to a friend of mine about it and they kinda said the same stuff. I should of pressed for details. So interwebs, am I the a-hole?

Results for me: I can accept everyone sucks here. I know how dumb it was to trust his judgement since he cycles a lot more than I do. For once I didn't prepare thinking he may have actually thought it through. Yeah I get it, I just never thought he could be that damn stupid.

He asked me to come the day prior. I stayed at his place, I had proper clothing in my car but it would of made us late to go get those things. He also kept telling me that we would be close to a bus stop or union station whenever I would ask but the all of a sudden we are miles opposite of what he said. I'll never trust his ass again with this crap. I'm usually a very well prepared person. The one time I trust someone else to take the lead, I get fucked. I will have to talk to him about this because that is downright dangerous in my opinion. 

I also felt wronged because he tried to invite himself to an 8 hr hike I went on the day prior and considering he's a cyclist not a hiker I told him it wasn't in his best interest. So why couldn't he take the same metal process to think of my health?  Just another example of me thinking of others more than they think of me.

c1o2vg	2019-06-17 14:20:52	throwaway84846189394	AITA for installing a VPN on my phone to watch porn?	"Throwaway. 

I’m (15M) and am heterosexual (idk if this makes a difference so I’ll add it anyway). Also only child. When I was 12 I was gifted an iPhone 6 for Christmas and have the same phone to date. I have gotten a job this year (money is used for the family and we have a family data plan cause it’s cheaper). We also have family WiFi. 

Family WiFi is restricted by smoothwall for pornographic material. Two months after I received the phone I found out about porn and was interested. Watched porn on data for about a year and was tired of not being able to use my phone on data because it was all going to porn. When I was 13, I figured out how to buy a VPN (got an iCloud gift card for birthday) to bypass the smoothwall. (Also would like to mention I never spent any money on porn) Have been using VPN to watch porn ever since. 

Bring it to today and my mom was looking through my phone (I have a passcode but I have shared it with my mom for emergencies). So already I think that’s a breach of privacy. And with my luck porn is open on my phone. Mom met up with dad and basically said that I was lying to them and went behind their back. Also mad at me for watching porn (I don’t know why though. My family is atheist and I’m really confused why they think it’s bad for me to watch porn but I really don’t want a nitty gritty conversation about it). So I am grounded for a month from my phone until I learn my lesson. (Writing this on the school computer if y’all are wondering) 

I haven’t talked to them about it but I really want to know if I’m in the wrong. I feel like it’s my possession and I can do what I want with it. My parents side is that I indirectly lied to them by secretly downloading a VPN and watching porn.

My husband's family has recently started calling, texting and messaging me on social media trying to spark conversation and invite me to things since I'm a SAHM. I always decline... Frankly because I just don't want to go. I've been with my husband since I was 14, I'm now 30. I've been this way my entire life. He is fine with my introverted personality. *note: I take my kiddos to play dates and parties they're invited to, because my disdain for socializing isn't going to thwart their lives*

My in laws have started talking to my husband, being upset that I never want to chat on the phone or go to their outings. When my husband is off, we will go together to see them and spend time. They see the kids at least once every two weeks, sometimes once a week or more. So it's not like they're not seeing their grandkids.

AITA for not going to hang out for lunches and chat all the time, when I just don't want to?


ETA:

They have come out and said it, but they're giving the vibe that... Since I've known them for so long, I should have gotten over my hate for socializing with them and just suck it up and enjoy time with them.

Hubby doesn't care, other than that they're bugging him about it and he feels pulled in the middle. I've tried telling them myself that I just don't want to be a social butterfly all the time...

c1nw6l	2019-06-17 14:03:53	queen-of	AITA for yelling at my friend group about them questioning my relationship with another friend?	"Mobile. Trying to keep this short. One of my closest friends, Sam (25m) and I (23F) have known each other for 2 years. We first met on Tinder and realized that my best friend, Ruby, was our mutual friend. She invited us both to the bar that following week and we ended up hooking up. Now, I really thought this was going to be a one night stand. I had just gotten out of a relationship and didn’t want to go into another. Made this very clear and we were both on the same page. He ended up leaving something in the car and asks Ruby for my number. She gives it to him and he texts me to pick it. We start chatting and become fwbs. During this time we are very open with each other. It works well for us. 
            3 months in Ruby, Sam, and I are at a bar and we invite Sams’s sister, Tina. They hit it off and start dating. Sam and I fizzle for one reason or another and work on being just friends. It takes a while but he is now one of the ppl I trust most in the world. Everyone thinks we’re dating bc of our past and how we treat one another. Honestly tho it’s just respect. He and I have worked very hard to create this friendship and so we cherish it. No other feelings there. All of our friends are constantly asking him if he likes and tell me all the time that he does (they’re all 2-4 years older). I don’t believe this, as I said we’re very open and I feel he would have told me if that’s the case. 
     Here’s the problem: their constant questions do start to get annoying after a while. Sam and I have taken an off hands approach up until now. But last night after countless jokes about us dating i got very annoyed and frustrated and yelled at our friends, Ruby and Tina included, and told them to mind their own business. That even if Sam and I were dating, which we aren’t, I wouldn’t have to tell them anything. Tina than began to cry saying that Sam and I don’t trust her and now everyone is saying I’m the AH. I feel justified bc I honestly don’t think they should be this invested in what Sam and I may or may not be doing And we’ve told them a plethora or times that nothing is happening. I may be the asshole bc we are a very close friend group and never yell at each other. And according to some outside friends bc of Sam and I’s past it makes sense for them to question us. So AITA?"

I walk my dog through it daily because it is a quiet and grassy space, and I frequently see other people do the same including my neighbors and others who drive with their dogs to it. I keep my dog on leash, don't walk through the spaces with the actual graves unless  I have a reason to like an oncoming car, and pick up after my dog and occasionally other trash I see such as beer cans and other stray trash. I also purposely avoid people mourning and ongoing funerals to the best of my abilities.

Yesterday, a gentleman probably in his 50's or so pulled up to me and my wife in his car with his window down. This happens occasionally since the cemetery is easy to get lost in so I slowed down too. He immediately told us to not walk our dog through the cemetery ever. He was irate from the start, saying things like there are families here, etc. At first, I told him to ""Mind his own business,"" which led him to tell me to, ""Go fuck myself."" I kept walking in the opposite direction of his car to catch up to my wife. He stopped his car, stepped out, continued to tell us to fuck off. I told him to do the same and my wife and I kept walking back to our home.

I understand the sentiment to a degree, but I was not doing anything disrespectful in the moment he accosted us. It was Father's Day, so I understand too if emotions were high for that reason.

"So me and this girl (who happens to be ginger/redhead whatever ya want to call it, we'll call her A) started speaking in person and I got her snapchat so we've been speaking over that aswell for maybe about 6 days or so. She seems pretty cool and I was enjoying speaking to her (until recently). She is currently on holiday in Spain.

Now full disclosure I love to crack risky jokes within reason, it's just something I've always done and it is something that has got me in hot water in the past particularly with women. If I see an opportunity for a quick witty roast you best believe I'm taking it whether it be with my friends or with a girl. Not to the point where I'm constantly jabbing people regarding their appearance but if I think of something in my head most times I can't resist bumping my gums.

I had already took a slight jab at A because she said that she had suncream on and I replied with ""Factor 80?"" and she just replied with ""No haha"" which seemed like a pretty neutral response to me so I didn't really think much of it. 

Today, me and A are talking over snapchat whilst she's sunbathing and says that she has tan lines. I decided it was about time I REALLY tested the water with one of my roasts and so I say to her ""Wow! That's really impressive for a ginger!"".

Needless to say, this didn't go well and A felt that I was mocking her for her appearance. I tried explaining to her that I didn't intend to hurt her feelings and that it was just a silly jab and I do it all the time and that she can do it back to me if she wants. She said that if that's the way I am then she doesn't want to talk to me and has since just been giving me the silent treatment. I've given up trying to apologise to her but at this point I've just given up because it doesn't really seem worth the effort.

The wind blows smoke straight back into the house and we live in an extremely small house. He denies this despite the fact that me, my mother, and my brother all tell him that he fills the house with smoke everyday. He then also denies that third hand smoke exists. (third hand smoke is residual nicotine and other chemicals left on indoor surfaces by tobacco smoke.) My friends hate coming to my house because they aren't scent blind to the third hand smoke. My friends are the people who made me realize that my house was covered in third hand smoke when they literally winced from walking into my house for the first time. He also smokes around me outdoors and when I ask him to please stop he gets mad as if I'm attacking him and will tell me to shut up or stop nitpicking.   
His smoking, until recently, was just a nuisance I had to live with. But now it has changed my life forever. In the past 2 months I have developed 2 diseases which last a lifetime on and off. Psoriasis, and bronchitis. Due to my fathers careless smoking I now must live with 2 diseases the rest of my life and I'm at extreme risk of permanent joint damage from my psoriasis. My father denies that this is his fault and has not changed his smoking habits due to it."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

He would call me names and beat me. Which caused me to develop a stutter from emotional stress, so I have difficulty speaking sometimes. My mom is a great mom and loves me and my brother. But she can get on your nerves cuz she can have that “I’m right and your wrong” attitude. Last year after my mom divorced my dad. I became the man of the house. Me and my mom would get into arguments over stuff like who should do the dishes clean the house that kind of stuff. When I would talk I would stutter a lot. Sometimes you couldn’t understand what I’m saying. And when this would happen my mom would mock my stutter and say “well if you can’t spit it out you have to do it” I would almost always couldn’t say the word I was trying to and ultimately gave up and did the stuff she yelled at  me to do. One day we were arguing. (.Forgot what it was about) and I started to stutter a lot. She began to mock me saying “COME ON LITTLE BABY SPIT IT OUT” and I just couldn’t take her mocking me anymore so I just screamed in a fit of anger “YOUR SUCH A FUCKING BITCH” and proceeded to go to my room and lay down. She hasn’t mocked me since that day but idk if I should have said that..

c1npj1	2019-06-17 13:46:35		wibta if I (18f) asked my boyfriend (18m) to tag along on the trip hes going on with friends?	"a little background on our relationship w/o going into too much detail: we dated for about 8 months during high school, summer, and the beginning of university. due to the fact that we entered a ltr for uni, lots of complications arose and we broke up. currently, we are not ""officially"" dating, but we are exclusively seeing each other and are definitely still in love, but dont want to over commit given how badly it all fell apart this fall. 

anyway, last summer, while we were still together, we went to this music festival across the country together (along with his friends, who have all met and more or less like me - I dont know some of them too well yet). it was my first festival and totally turned me onto raves because it was such a magical experience (he ended up having a ton of fun with me as well). hes going again this year with his friends, and I really want to go. I would go myself if I had any friends who were into this sort of thing, or if I had any other way to get a ride (other than through him), but unfortunately I dont. 

i want to ask him if there is any way I can catch a ride up with him & his friends if theres any extra space. obviously I would contribute to gas + any food/equipment they will bring. 

the thing is, I'm not sure whether or not I should ask. I think it would put pressure on him & if he says no (which I think is most likely), he will most likely feel guilty and I will end up feeling disappointed and sad (even though I won't blame him for the decision). I know he probably wants to spend time with his friends, not me, before he goes back to school across the country, and he probably worries that if I come, he'll end up having to spend most of his time with me (not as if I'd expect him to but this was what he was worried about last year).

I cant stress enough how much I want to go, but I'm feeling very conflicted on whether or not it's my place to ask & if I do, how to even approach the question without putting any undue pressure on him. I should also mention that he has already been to one festival with these friends so far this summer, which I didnt go to.

tldr; the bf is going on a trip with his friends to a music festival I really want to go to, wibta if I tried to tag along on his friend trip?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1nn4e	2019-06-17 13:39:58	emanonn159	AITA for refusing to help a friend?	"Last year a girl in my friend group, lets call her Jill, was more than a little interested in my best friend, lets call him Jack. He has told her multiple times that he isn't interested, but is too much of a passive person to draw any difficult lines in the sand. As a result, she ended up living in his house last year. She didn't pay rent there, but she made her meals there, did her laundry there, and even slept on a spare mattress at the foot of his bed. He doesn't appreciate this, obviously, but this post isn't about Jack and Jill.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for well over a year at this point, and we basically live together. Our parents are very conservative, and she is hesitant to lease together per their warning. Jill sees an opportunity here. She approaches me and asks if I would be interested in a deal to fix both of our situations. She would lease with my girlfriend, I would lease with Jack, and we would spend little time at home so it would work out all around. We might be able to store a few clothing items in each other's rooms and whatnot. I think this is a less than ideal situation, but I agree to help a friend.

Fast forward to this summer: Jack and Jill are living together while I am out of town. I am fine with this, their problems are their own. I get a message from Jill: ""Hey, utilities are not what I expected they are, so I am going to pay rent+utilities with Jack. You can pay at your girlfriend's house."" I was floored initially by this message, but I felt generous and had long conversations with her about who is paying what and why. I was upset that she would assume I should pay more at a place I'm not even living at for the summer. I pushed this to the back of my mind, and wired her half the difference between our rent and utilities, so that we both make out evenly in this deal.

Jill is very upset about this, and later tells me that she has moved her dresser and bed into my room. Sensing that something larger was afoot, I call quits on the deal, that she needs to keep her things out of my room. I tell her I will split all costs evenly with her until the fourth of July, when I have time to visit in person, and we will have a conversation about payments and housing rights with all housemates present. She decides to involve housemates over text and tells only her side  of the story.

I have been busy for days replying to people saying how could I be this unfair? Jill just wanted to have a room at Jack's house, she should be able to pay rent+utilities there and not have to sleep on the couch!

I am completely flabbergasted. I feel more than justified calling quits on the deal. I thought she would pay rent+utilities for her room, that is filled with her items. I will not use her room anyways, I will be in my girlfriend's room. How am I supposed to make it clear to her that she cannot have two whole rooms at my expense? AITA for saying she can't move in?

c1nmmr	2019-06-17 13:38:40		AITA for selling my 15 y/o busted-up car to my friend?	"Car's old and rusty with a lot of miles on it. It had a big list of minor problems and I told them all of the problems I knew about at the time, like broken power locks, rusted body, squeaky suspension. I've never bought or sold a used vehicle before so I didn't know all the ins and outs of the process. I was selling it to them for like $500 because he's a really good friend of mine and needs his first car. I even put another $200 into it right before selling it to them to get the oil changed, get it cleaned up, and replaced the spark plugs and cleaned out the engine.

&#x200B;

So after they buy it, they take it to get safetied (I didn't know this needed to happen to get it plated), and it failed because the parking break is busted. That's another $250 maybe. Now they want to return it to me, even though I sold it as-is and in good faith, telling them everything I knew was wrong with it. I said I can't afford to take it back and even offered to pay for half of the bill for the breaks, but they don't want it anymore. Comparable cars online in that price range are  We had a contract stating it was being sold ""as is"" with no guarantees or anything, but I'm still being treated like I fucked them out of the money.

c1nkh3	2019-06-17 13:32:55	WingedJanitor	AITA for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?	"Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so.

We’ve had laughs along the way and we have so many memories to share. When we’re together and we’re with his other mates, we get along at a deeper level because of the history between us, as opposed to him friends that he’s known 4 years max...

My best mate is a dealer. Has been for about 5 years or so now. Everyday without fail I’ll meet up with him, and some of our other mates (now my mates due to my best mate introducing me to them) and we’ll smoke a lot of weed, and just do goofy things just having fun. Obviously he has an abundance of weed in him, and his mates who are with us will buy from him and contribute to a joint. I never buy it yet I’m always apart of the joint whenever someone rolls.

Take last night for example... I was in his house chilling on PlayStation and he whacked some weed, made a joint and before I knew it he passed it to me. His other friends had their own weed, rolled a joint and before I. Knew it they passed it to me. They all seem to have their own, but me, and yet I’m managing to smoke the same, maybe just a little bit less than all those who have provided their own.

My best mate does invite me out everyday, and ALWAYS says “I’ll roll a joint for when you get it”, but a part of me feels like I’m the asshole for not providing my own weed

EDIT: *I spoke to him shortly after posting this and after reading the comments and he doesn’t want anything from me. I told him it’s the least I could do but he’s declining anything from me, and then continued to invite me out for a joint. I think I’ll surprise him*"	No A-holes here	0	0	559.0	303.0	0.0	0.0

c1ng4a	2019-06-17 13:21:18	GayScunt	AITA for breaking up with someone over text on the day of her exam?	"I know the title sounds bad but just hear me out pls.

This happened about a year and a half ago during my first year of university. I had gotten into a bit of a relationship with this girl and she was super into me. All was well up until about 2 months in and I realized I no longer wanted to be with her. 

I had arranged a day in which I would break things off in person because that would’ve been the right thing to do, right??

Fast forward about a week before doing the deed, keep in mind I chose a day that was after exams as I didn’t want to bring extra stress into her life. 

She texts me asking if everything is ok (I assume I was subconsciously stand-offish as per me no longer sharing feelings. She was suspicious of this). 

That day was also the morning of one of her exams. I was torn because I didn’t want to have to end it with her during exams (let alone on the day of an exam) and I didn’t want to lie and say it was all ok only to break it off with her a week later. 

I decided to respond and say “can we meet up and talk about that?” to which she said something like “I can’t handle face to face. If you’re breaking up with me i’m gonna break up with you first.” and then tried to guilt me about it being on the day of one of her exams. 

Keep in mind I still tried to make her less upset by asking if she had any questions or anything that would help her clear her mind. 

Recently (A YEAR AND A HALF LATER) she’s been telling people that I am and arsehole for doing this. I wouldn’t even have known but she told my current gfs friend who told her who told me. 


I’ve been told that I’m TA and that I’m NTA from varying parties. So I’d just like to know once and for all AITA?

edit: I’ve received a few comments saying that I could have just said something like “I can’t talk now, good luck with the exam!” I’d like to clarify that I got the is everything ok text at about 9am and her exam was at 7pm so I couldn’t just say that because what could I be doing for 10 hours straight that would require me to avoid that question. 

If I had said that it would have caused more of an issue as she would just be wondering all day, thus making it harder to focus on the exam that evening. My bad for the lack of clarity.

Also people saying I should’ve waited one day. How would I have responded to her asking if everything is ok? I would’ve said ya everything’s fine and then the next day just switch, I have trust issues now because of a girl I went out with before her did something like that to me, in my eyes that would just do more bad in the long term."

Ever since we got together I have told her I don't want children, not joking in passing but during serious conversation I have made my view's clear and asserted my position that I don't want children of my own.

Let me be clear, I don't hate children, I have nephews ranging from 18 months to 7years old and I love them all and would do, have done, anything for them to help and protect them. I just don't want any children of own.

A few weeks ago my ex and I are sat talking about life, talking about moving somewhere new to live and move on up in life when the conversation about children comes up again. The whole conversation was amicable and there was no yelling or frying pads flying round the room and I tell her my view's and that I don't want children.

I made it clear it has nothing to do with her and I love her and still do but I just don't want children, I have known this since I was about 15 and nothing has changed for me. In fact watching the world as it is that's just been re-enforced.

Come the end of the conversation she is very upset with me, telling me that I should have made this clear from the start as she wouldn't of wasted 5 years with me and then walked out.

TL:DR W were together for 5 years, I don't want children, she did, she feels I have wasted her life for not being clear from the start when I was.

Edit: Thank you for everything you guys have said, I do still really care for her and I do wish her the best. I don't feel that I've wasted any time with her and I believe that what she said was in anger/frustration. Breakups are shit, but I'm British so I'll have a cuppa and carry on."

I hear people say that whoever invites should pay. This sounds fine in theory, however, men are systematically pressured into asking out women.

c1ndur	2019-06-17 13:15:06	Kido_exe	AITA for confronting people cutting line while acting like they dont know what they´re doing?	"Today I went to my school to get my grade signed. 

So there I am in front of the doors of the professors office that is soon to come to give me (and other 30people all bunched up there) our grade. He eventualy comes late and tells us to go into this room that is next to where his office is so people can walk thru.

So we sit in there (and the room has big glass doors and faces his office so we see everything). Time goes on and he invites 5 by 5, its going really slow but its going. Eventually some more people come and they are confused or just dont care how theres noone waiting but we signal them and tell them that we are all waiting in here and they can take a seat at the end of the waiting line, and they do.

Eventualy a group of girls come and after being told that this is the waiting line (room) they like look at eachother worried and start discussing something. **But as they are discussing it they arent moving anywhere**, they are effectively still standing in front of prof. office hugging those doors.

Im looking at them waiting them to start going to the back of the line but they are avoiding eye contact acting dumb and apparently deaf. I clearly see the tactic and whats going on and I stand up, walk up to the office doors and just stand in front of them almost pushing back the girl standing first.

She is clearly shook and asks me ""Do you also have a test at 5PM"" (Its 4:35PM)

I reply no and add on how they cut the huge hour long line and how thats not okay.

She looks at her friends completely flabbergasted like she saw a ghost and they collectively start saying yappering at me, trying to tell me off I guess.

Stuff like ""We have to hurry we got a test in 10min"" or ""Wheres your collegiality"" to which I said ""Collegiality? Did you go in to the room and ask other 40people waiting do they have test at 5PM? Or are we all idiots for waiting in line and not just camping the doors like you 5 smart princesses?""

Ofcourse that didnt have any effect on them and they continued to collectively bombard me with ""Are you normal"" ""OMG what is this guy"" (They were like bunch of 18-19YO) I also said stuff like ""Where were you raised"" or ""Did noone ever teach you any manners"" to which i got those ridiculing laughs which I assume only come from them actually thinking they arent doing anything wrong.

They went and knocked on the doors and they got told not to come in and to wait outside to which I just laughed.

After prof yelled ""next"" I walked in but so did they. So even though I got my place, other 40 people still sitting back there are being fucked over. I got my grade and left.

**I know this might be obvious, but just recently I told myself I wont take any more of these situations nor will I just keep quiet. So these are my first experiences actually confronting people and I just need a nudge from someone confirming to me that this is what I need to do and is correct.**"	Not the A-hole	0	0	179.0	58.0	0.0	0.0

c1ncd2	2019-06-17 13:11:08	cindywuhoo	AITA for not wanting to help my mom	" My mom runs a summer camp for kids. Every year since she started her business, she has asked me to teach some of the students ballet for two hours a day. This basically means I have to go with her to the school everyday at 7:30 am, teach dance from 2-4, and help out with the kids all day until 6. My mom has never paid me for this, and I have always just done it to help her out. This summer, I have the opportunity for a ""distance internship"", which is basically working with a professor on a project without going to the lab everyday. I would have loved to work in the lab directly this summer, but I knew my mom would need my help. The project turned out to be a lot of work, so I haven't been as involved with the kids at the camp. This really angered my mom, and she complained about me ""wasting time on the computer"" everyday. I tried to tell her I was coding, but she wouldn't believe me. She finally told me she was sick of my behavior and didn't need me anymore. Fine by me, I could finally stay home and be productive without crazy kids all around me. Today came around, and she told me I had to come with her again. She woke me up and yelled at me when I lingered in bed, saying I was so tired because I was always watching TV. I was pretty upset, but then she yelled at me again for being lazy at the camp. My mom has a habit of going off on tangent after tangent, so it eventually got to me being very selfish. I finally told her I didn't want to go with her and told her why - I had work to do, she didn't pay me, she had just berated me pretty harshly, and honestly, I just didn't want to spend my summer chasing after crying kids anymore. She exploded. She told me if I didn't help her, I could never ask her for anything again. I already pay for my own piano lessons, but she wouldn't pay for any of my ballet classes or performances. She also said I could never ask her to pick me up or take me anywhere again, including taking me to my tutoring job since I can't drive. When I argued that other kids don't have to work for free for their parents to get rides and take classes, she told me they all did and I was the only one who was so selfish. There was a lot said, but the worst was it was useless having a daughter like me. I can tell she's serious about everything; my mom doesn't say things like that lightly.

I know this is long, but I feel really hurt. For some background, my mom and I have a good relationship, but we fight fiercely. We are both very stubborn and hold grudges. I really don't help around the house as much as I should, which is one of the things she brought up. I am selfish and lazy, so I can see her point. My dad and brother both basically took her side, so I guess I wanted to know if I really am in the wrong here. I love my mom and I want to make up, but I am very angry and sad. I never considered our relationship would be so transactional.

EDIT: thank you all for the good advice. i apologized to my mom for not helping around the house and told her i couldn't help out at the camp everyday. she basically just yelled at me again lol. the gist was if i wasn't willing to help her, why would she help me?

She moves up here to get away from her boyfriend of 2 years that have been getting into bad arguments and finally ended up spitting on her. She texts me later that night asking if I know anyone with heroin for her friend/roomate. She was withdrawing super badly and she felt bad and had never seen it get this bad before. I told her no but get a medical card and take high doses of weed and it won't be as bad. Completely ignored that. She comes in the next day saying she was up all night vomiting from food allergies. Then asks to go home bc she doesn't feel good bc she's vomiting still. End of shift comes and her drawer is missing $20. So I tell mg hey spa lead asked me for this shit also there's $20 missing from the drawer she opened this morning. After talking with mg and another associate about how much they know about her they all say she lives with her mom and brother when she told me she lives with a roommate. Me and mg talk more and she lets me know that spa lead had had problems with heroin before according to former associates at the spa she relocated from. So time goes by and they don't say anything to her until now and today she is suspended for 5 days and knows I told mg. She asked me why I would do that and I just asked her what her friends name is, bc I honestly don't think she's real and fuck heroin and I'm not dealing w a drugged out bitch shooting up in the bathrooms and calling an ambulance for narcan. Am I really the asshole here? Sure I shouldn't get involved with work drama but c'mon


Update: me and three others are gonna simultaneously quit bc of how the owners treated our mg for handling the situation, as professionally as she could basically not telling until she knew it wasn't just drama, aaaaand spa lead was relocated to our spa like 200 miles away to get her sober bc she had already been using and selling at the spa she relocated from. They never told our mg about these issues when spa lead relocated so lmao bye."	Not the A-hole	0	0	317.0	31.0	0.0	0.0
c1n94m	2019-06-17 13:02:19		AITA for no longer cleaning up the house after I agreed to and moving out before my lease is up?	"When I moved in with my roommate (I signed a year long roommate agreement), he offered to reduce my rent $100 a month if I kept the common areas clean (kitchen, bathroom and living room) and I agreed.  When I went to view the place initially everything looked clean and fine. I had also had roommates before so I thought I knew what to expect. Boy was I wrong.

My roommate is filthy. The dirtiest person I have ever lived with by far, and I have had nine other roommates over the course of undergrad and grad school.  He is 29 years old, so way old enough to know better.  

It takes up an entire Saturday or Sunday to clean up these areas because of how dirty he is. I'm talking piles of dishes unwashed (he cooks and does not clean after), a disgusting bathroom that would make sketchy gas station bathrooms look good (he has digestive/IBS issues and leaves the evidence splattered all over the toilet and wall), piles of mail/crap that accumulates all over every surface during the week, etc.   

When I made the initial agreement I thought there would be a two hour or so per week cleaning commitment. Essentially dusting, sweeping, mopping, etc.  I didn't expect that he wouldn't clean up after himself at all.

After getting sick of losing a whole day of every weekend to clean up after him I told him I couldn't do it anymore, but would pay to have someone come do a deep clean every other week. He would only have to clean up after himself (do his dishes after cooking, put away his mail, etc).  He had an absolute fit, screaming that we had an agreement, that he doesn't want strangers in his house and demanded I continue to clean.  I offered to pay the original rent price and just clean up after myself, he refused and made the same demand.    

So I just stopped cleaning.  Now the house is absolutely and positively disgusting.  So gross that the only clean area is my bedroom, I no longer use the kitchen at all and spray bleach on common surfaces in the bathroom before using them. I am actively looking for a new place  and in the meantime avoid being in the house as much as possible.

**A bit of backstory about BF:** We've been together for 1.5 years, live together for almost a year, and generally have a fantastic relationship. We've discussed exes (upon my request) - he's a bit shy in this respect, but generally we know how many people we've been with (but not necessarily who we've been with, except for mutual friends). 

So, here's the situation: 2.5 years ago, I had a bit of a ho phase - I had broken up with my BF at the time, long and exhausting relationship, and I wanted to live a little. I dated around, hooked up with a few guys and made out with a couple more. The guy in question (G) was a friend of a friend, we were partying one night, I was super drunk, we made out on the dancefloor a bit and that was it. G texted me a couple times after, I was polite but made it known I wasn't interested in pursuing anything further, a month or so he visited my friend again and we had a face-to-face chat where I said I think he's a cool guy but I'm not interested, he was polite and calm about it, and we haven't had any communication since (2+ years ago).

G is coming over for a friend's fairly important life event. Due to some mix-up with accommodation, he asked my flatmate (F) if he can stay over for 1 night. F and G, and G's friends are all super close (which is why he asked). F cleared it up with me, I said I don't mind (he'll sleep in her room on the floor or in the living room). Generally, I don't mind him, we're courteous around each other and I consider what happened between us minor and ancient history.

This gets me to my current question: **WIBTA if I** ***don't*** **tell my BF G and I made out 2 years ago?** I don't want to put him in an awkward situation but on the other hand, it's not like we dated/hooked up/saw each other more than once. I'm not sure if it's not going to just hurt my BF or make things awkward for him... If it matters, I don't plan on us spending any time with G while he's here - G won't hang out at our place during the day, and will probably come with F to crash later in the evening."

c1n3ae	2019-06-17 12:46:24	throwawayyy727	AITA for snapping at my girlfriend's friend?	"So I'm gonna cut straight to the chase. My girlfriend and I are in a text chat with a few other friends. One of these friends (who I'll call T) usually makes these hurtful jokes that put her down a lot. I mainly remain calm when he makes these and just tell him to stop. He eventually does stop but makes these jokes again another time.

This time he went way too far: basically telling her that she's not proper girlfriend material, that I'll eventually move on from her and get a better girlfriend and leave her in the gutter, as well as some other generally nasty ""jokes"". This is where I snapped. I told him to stop making these jokes and that he's coming off as a dick. When I asked him what he gained from doing this, he replied with: ""so much satisfaction"".

I spoke to my girlfriend about this and she said that she didn't care about the jokes and that she'll be fine. She didn't seem overly confident in her answer, but I left it at that as I didn't want to argue with her. However, she has low self-esteem to begin with, and I feel as though these jokes are just cementing the fact that she's a bad person in the back of her head (although she's an amazing person).

So AITA for getting mad at him for making these jokes and stopping him whenever he makes them?


EDIT #1: I spoke to my girlfriend about this and she told me that she was lying the first time j asked her about this. She was hurt by the comments and was just being overly kind by saying that ""it was just a joke"". I will be confronting T about it in the next few days."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1n1tx	2019-06-17 12:42:22		WIBTA? My housemate has basically moved his GF in.I want to snitch on him to our landlord	"I made a thread on this previously asking what to do, and now I've taken (some) action

I am in a house of 5. One of the other housemates brings his GF round pretty much every night after work. I didn't realise it was all the time when I first moved in as he's a chef and they get home around midnight so wasn't always up. But enough time has passed now that I see that...yes, 99% of the time she comes back here with him after work and they leave together the next morning. On his day off, Sunday, she is nearly always here (I know as they spend a lot of hours on Sundays cooking in the kitchen)

I wondered at times about why he never went back to hers, but I never asked.

Recently she went on holiday to China to see her family for a week and she came back Friday night and left her huge suitcase and bag in the hallway. As it's been a couple of days I said to him ""hey, is your gf gonna take her bags home at some point? It's getting a lil crowded in the hallway with them there"". He then seemed confused and said she didn't have her own place that she just stayed here with him

Couldn't believe my ears. Was furious but too much of a coward to definitively sort out the issue there and then

So what I plan to do is approach him later, take him aside for a word and say ""hey man, you can't go around moving people in to our house without even asking if anyone is okay with it. I know our contract says guests can stay over max of 2 nights a month but it doesn't need to be that strict, but just ease off with a bit, as it's out of order adding a 6th person when the understanding is we live in a five person household""

And if he refuses I'm planning on emailing the landlord and saying that he's been having someone over nearly every night for 6 months, and do whatever I can to return things to normalcy....a 5 person house like the damn advertisement said

Two of my other housemates are now a couple and I discussed it with them, they're super chill and said they are often out so don't mind too much, but they said they were never consulted either.

The remaining housemate wants me to just go straight to the landlord, she and him don't get along very well

I don't think they add much extra to the bills as he works 6 days a week and long hours (dunno what she does, presumably a chef too), and I haven't kept a close enough eye on the bills

So I can imagine he might use that as a reason that it doesn't matter. The money is secondary to me, it's the having an extra person around every single late evening in the kitchen or living room, and most of Sunday too

But I'm well past humouring the situation now and I will be going to the landlord (unless he backs down and says she's going to handle her business and rent a place) one way or another

I have a kinda embarrassing health issue so I take a little while in the bathroom to fix stuff. I was in a stall for maybe ten minutes, and was almost finished when someone knocked on the door. The conversation went something like this:
Them: are you alright?

Me: I’m fine! 

Them: you’ve been in there a while

Me: yeah I’m fine. I’ll be out in a bit. 

At this point I get irritated because the stalls next to me are unoccupied, and like,
Leave me alone, I’m busy. I’m praying they’ll just leave. 

Them: Are you here for the training course?

Me: no! I work here! I’ll be out in a bit! I’m fine!

Them: it’s been a while-

I get really annoyed and instead of being like “I need more time to fix my jacked up body” I say 

“I’m fine. Just a little nauseated. I’m ok.”

Them: are you-

Me: LEAVE ME ALONE


The two of them then basically scurried out and sounded shocked. I feel bad because they were clearly just trying to make sure I was alright and they probably had good intentions. aita for yelling at them?

UPDATE: the girls went to my boss. This morning my boss called me out of work and said that a woman came to her office yesterday saying I was crying in the bathroom. I’m furious. Not only was I very clearly not crying, I repeatedly stated I was fine. And she decided to go to my boss? She doesn’t even work with me! She doesn’t know me! I can’t sniff slightly in the bathroom because of a minor cold without being interrogated, disbelieved and reported? I had felt guilty because I was sure she had good intentions, but now I don’t care about her intentions, she is a nosy busybody who doesn’t know how to behave in a workplace."

"Some back story I just got home from a deployment about a month ago, I have been asking my mom for three weeks now to register my car, I had one of my friends fix it and I sent him the parts and money he needed to fix it and he was going to get it inspected and drive it down about 9 hours to me so I could use it and go back up when I get long weekends. Well she never registered it and all mine and my friends efforts are in vain because she wouldn't register the car. And she is still giving me BS excuses like, I'll do it this day, that the day comes and she says she will do it another day. Now the car was supposed to come down this week and my friend and I were planning on hanging out, mind you 3 weeks of planning because it a good distance just for a weekend, anyway a holiday is also coming up where I am going to get a long weekend, fourth of july and I told my mom that I would need the car so I could go visit. Well now I am buying a car and I still plan on going up 9 hours to visit my friends and family but I think I am not going to see my mom, she obviously doesn't care if I can even make it up to home, so WIBTAH?

Edit: So I feel I need to elaborate more. The relationship with my mom had always been rough, she kicked me out when I was 16 and I have pretty much been own my own since then then. Yes the car is her car and she offered to guve it to me since she dosen't use it and has two other vehicles, and I am going underway again in about 2 months, so I didn't really want to buy a car just for 2 months. Another note, my mom is in the middle of a divorce with my stepdad who I was fairly close with up untill I got booted and she met a guy just before I left and didn't tell me untill a few months ago and she is already engaged with him and she has apparently been neglecting my younger sister (who is 14 so she can kinda fend for herself) but she isn't taking it well and thinks that it's because of this new guy, I'm not around them so I just have to go off of what they tell me so I don't really know whats going on down there but my mom works from home so she has plenty of time to register the car, I even offered her money to do it but she just ignored my offers, so I get the feeling that she never intended to do this for me. But why would she tell me that she was going to do it? 

And yes I got back about a month ago and waited about a week or so to talk to her about the car."	Not enough info	0	0	41.0	10.0	0.0	0.0
c1mve9	2019-06-17 12:22:27	RageAndWar	AITA for not inviting my mom?	"So, I’m currently in college and have two older siblings who have their own families. My mom lives alone, although she lives near my sister, so she visits them very often.

Last Friday, my brother invited me to go with him, my sister, and a few other people to a spring near his house. You have to get to the spring early if you want to get in, as they only let in so many people. This meant we would all be staying at his house overnight and then getting up early to get to the spring.

After I get there, my brother told me that he didn’t invite my mom for a couple reasons: she’s told him in the past that she can’t sleep at his house as their beds aren’t comfortable on her back, she’d have to drive to his house late at night when she hates driving at night, and she told him she’ll be working on Saturday (the day we’re going to the spring). He told me he didn’t want to invite her when he knew she’d say no and she would feel bad for declining.

Anyways, we all go to the spring and we spend about half the day there. Right before we leave, I see a text from my mom asking what I was doing. I told her we were just leaving the spring. She then messages me saying she’s very sad she wasn’t invited and can’t believe that her family went without her. She also tells me that she knew my brother and sister were going, but she didn’t know that they invited me. Apparently, the fact that they invited me and not her is what made her sad. 

I tried telling her the reasons my brother mentioned for why we didn’t invite her and she said that she still would have liked an invite anyways because she was feeling left out. I also told her that I never get to spend time with my siblings where we can just hang out together and that we should be able to do things without her. She responded with a passive aggressive “have fun” and I haven’t talked to her since.

I’m feeling pretty guilty and it breaks my heart when she’s sad. Should I have invited her in the first place?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	81.0	24.0	0.0	0.0
c1mv92	2019-06-17 12:22:03	Timeshatterer	AITA for getting pissed at a friend for sending me a pic of her neck with a hickey	"So, context, this girl became my friend after we tried dating but didn't work, a few months ago.

We've been friends ever since, helping one another with college/work stuff, talking, going to Church together, and all, but we both know it's not the same as any other friendship because of our past relationship. We were together for about a month, but she didn't want a boyfriend, so we ended it. No hard feelings, clearly, because we became friends.

But yesterday she sent me a picture of her neck with a hickey on it and ""motherf*cker"" written on in on Instagram, like the one you'd send someone you were with after a night out. No biggie, I answered ""(friend), it wasn't me who did that to you. Send it to the right person next time lol""

She immediately freaked out and started texting me a bunch, saying it wasn't her neck, and she was sorry, and everything. We started talking on Whatsapp after that, and I sent her two or three times something on the terms of ""stop talking about it or I'll be pissed at you. It's an honest mistake, you don't owe me an explanation, just don't lie to me"". 

She kept lying it wasn't her (she'd hidden her face with the drawing tool in Instagram, but it was unmistakably her), then she started lying saying one of her girl friends had done it. I lost it at that, because, while there's nothing wrong with her having a hickey or even wanting to talk about it with a friend, the lying about it part made it look like she was trying to keep me as a ""side option"", or something. 

I told her I didn't care who hickeyed her, I wasn't her boyfriend, and I thought it was very shitty that she sent me this and lied about it. She got all defensive and started trying to paint herself as the victim in the situation, so I just answered ironically that I was the bad guy because I wanted her to be honest with me. She then deleted my contact, so I deleted hers, too, deleted the conversation and we haven't spoken since.

So, AITA?

c1mucw	2019-06-17 12:19:10		WIBTA if I cut contact with my schizophrenic uncle upon becoming his sole-surviving relative?	"The family situation at the moment is that my grandparents/his parents are in their 90s and rapidly declining, and my mother/his sister is ill with a life expectancy of maybe three years if she's lucky. I've got other family members -- from my father's side -- but pretty soon my uncle will only have me left. And I have no interest in him being part of my life. my uncle and I aren't close. Like, at all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We live in separate states, we've never hung out just the two of us or had a good conversation, I've never been to his house, we've never exchanged birthday gifts (and only done christmas gifts if I was visiting my grandparents) or even cards, and all in all I barely know the guy. What I do know about him is that he's a racist, a misogynist and a homophobe (I'm female and queer) who is extremely self-entitled. He expects (demands) his mother, who is half blind and can't walk unassisted, to fetch things for him or make endless cups of coffee (she's burnt her hands multiple times on the hot water) or just make a full meal for him at 4pm when he turns up unannounced.

&#x200B;

He's in his sixties with a house of his own yet still keeps tonnes of stuff at his parents house and expects them to look after it, eg. a boat that he expects his dementia-suffering father to maintain as well as pay the rego (or whatever it is) for it; random electronics that he will ignore for years on end and then suddenly demand angrily. He asks weirdly personal questions (like how many guys I've had sex with) out of nowhere and gets annoyed if you don't answer, but angrily refuses to answer any questions about himself no matter how impersonal (""what have you been watching on tv recently?"" - ""I don't see how that's any of your business, how dare you question me"").

&#x200B;

If it weren't for the schizophrenia I'd cut him off without a second thought, but sadly he does now and will in the future need help with things. Increasingly over the past 3 years he's gone off his meds. Not taking his meds for him means a variety of concerning actions such as: stalking people, committing random acts of fraud, causing public disturbances, disappearing, etc. He's been hospitalised/admitted to a facility four times in the past two years -- prior to this, he had gone roughly 20 years without incident.

&#x200B;

I know that it's not his fault that he acts the way he does when his mental illness is taking control, I just don't know if I can deal with it when I become the last family member left standing. I'm 25, just starting my career, and dealing with my own issues. I have neither the time, knowledge, nor temperament to deal with all the things that being his next-of-kin entails -- especially since I don't even like the guy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So: would cutting him off for the sake of my own mental health/life make me the biggest asshole? Or should I put on my big-girl pants and look out for my family no matter the personal cost?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Me, my brother and my friend were at a KBBQ restaurant just chillin and the service started off good. A bit of background, my friend DESPISES tipping, he almost never does it. Before everyone just starts calling him an asshole, hes not from the US so the whole system is just kinda absurd to him, and the rest of us usually leave a good tip. It sounds weird but its generally just a meme amongst our friend group at this point, and pushed enough he will leave something, especially for more expensive food.

Anyways, we were all having a good time joking and he was joked about him being a bad tipper and of course a waiter walks by the moment he said it. He didnt mention it but it was obvious he heard and mentioned it to the rest of the staff because our service went from fine to complete shit, as they didnt bring out certain items, took forever, and even brought out a cooked food that was burnt and borderline inedible. They werent outright rude to us but it was obvious they didnt care anymore since they thought werent getting tipped(We all did intend to leave one for the record).

My brother and I felt really bad about the situation and suggested we leave a hefty tip to sort of offset the comment since the service started off fine, but my friend was adamant about not leaving one. His logic was basically they service became trash so why bother leaving one now, even if they did misunderstand him joking. My brother and I ended up leaving a good tip much to his disagreement and when I brought it up to a friend of mine, he sided with my other friend and agreed we were stupid to leave a tip for the service and basically just wasted money. So basically my question is, was my friend an asshole for not tipping this shitty service and to extend were the rest of us dumb in leaving a tip for it? Thinking about it the best thing to do wouldve been to just suck up the embarrassment explain that it was joke, but hindsight is 20/20! What do you think, reddit?

EDIT: If it matters I wanted to include it was kbbq because it works in an all you can eat fashion sorta like sushi, so we got like half our food before we got shafted. Also my friend fully acknowledged he was wrong to make that joke"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Sometimes people take the time to reflect/introspect and do truly know what they want, but most in my experience don't. That leads to people saying stuff that usually ends up being widely inaccurate. Therefore, it's their actions- who they're attracted to/date, who they dislike/aren't attracted to, the way they act around you, etc that you have to watch to get a good picture of them. There are girls who say they like good guys but actually are attracted to rebels, and vice versa. There are girls that say they don't like you, but secretly do. So on and so forth. 

&#x200B;

I think this is reasonable, un-sexist advice. But Jack blabbed about it to our parents, and they're pissed because they think it's assholish and sexist. I don't think it is, because as I've already said, I would repeat the exact same advice were the genders switched."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I moved into a place recently and brought with me a very nice and expensive industrial fan, meant for cooling gyms or offices, but it works just as well for a house if you don't mind the noise (it can be very loud at higher settings). There's a similar fan in the common area but the other day it broke.

A little bit about my roommates: there are 5 others besides me, two of them are a father and his kid (4 years). The living area is pretty big (500sq feet with a kitchen) and contains a play area for the kid. It's a little bit chaotic for me so I tend to stay in my room when I'm not cooking or using the bathroom.

I was asked today by the dad if I'd be open to putting the fan in the living area so everyone can use it. I declined, saying that I like my room to be cool and if I moved it then my room would be uncomfortable. He persisted, saying that his kid has health problems that require him to be in a cool environment but would not elaborate when I asked what they were, saying it was private. Fair enough, but I again declined while suggesting that he get a cheaper fan online. He said that it wouldn't work as it's getting too hot for the room to be cooled by a weaker fan. Now everyone in the house thinks I'm a dick. Am I really the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1mg8f	2019-06-17 11:34:00		AITA for asking a chinese couple to lower down their volume in a restaurant?	"So yesterday was Father's Day as we all know and as a celebration, my parents took my family out for dinner at a fancy chinese restaurant. Immediately as I sit down I get a mild headache because of the table next to us. It was a chinese couple which I assume were from China because of their heavy accents. They were talking away loudly without any concern of the people around them. 

I get up and tell a waiter if I could change seats, explaining to him my situation. My ears are pretty sensitive and I get headaches when I hear loud noises. He told me that as the restaurant was pretty packed and because of that he could not do anything.

I decide to take things into my own matters, I politely told the couple in chinese,"" Sorry, could you lower down your volume? You are disturbing others."" The guy, then proceeds to tell me to go away as I interrupted their conversation. At this point I'm furious. You are disturbing others and yet you tell me to go away? 

My parents see what's happening and I can sense they are worried that the situation will escalate, thus telling me to sit back down and not disturb them.
I contain my anger and carry on with the meal.

When we get home, my father says that he and my mum were disappointed in my behaviour because they had taught me to be 'respectful' and what I had done was especially rude because we were in a public place. He also explained that people from China tend to be louder when talking so I should accept the fact that the couple was not in any wrong.

My son had friend in mind off the bat. Not a fan of this friend. He is known troublemaker. My son had switched schools in January and I said maybe wait to ask friend until we get closer to vacation bc he might meet a new friend at new school. 

Over next few months and knowing my son is not hanging out with this kid anymore, I asked son if he was sure he wanted to bring this friend. My son kept saying yes. So about a month ago he asked friend and things were set. I reached out to friends mom with details. 

Over next few weeks my son is hanging out with friend 2 all the time. After a sleepover at friends 2 house I said you’re hanging out with friend 2 more. Will it be weird being with friend 1 on trip. He said no. Well a few days later my son says he doesn’t want to invite friend 1 bc it will be weird. They don’t see each other anymore. The topper is my daughter (16) says friend 1 creeps her out. I give friend’s 1 mom the bad news. 

Friends 1 mom has subsequently posted on fb this whole story. Words like vacationgate and tragedy of 2019 were used. She thanked others who replied with support and even “offers of retaliation”. 

I know my son did not make best decision but difficult things happen in life. I think the mom is adding drama. 

Tldr- son invited friend from former school on vacation. Son stopped hanging out with him and wanted to invite friend 2. Friend 1 mom is posting ordeal on fb. “Retaliation” mentioned."	Asshole	0	0	353.0	29.0	0.0	0.0

c1m527	2019-06-17 10:55:31	Zeeyk	AITA for telling my ex girlfriend that my friend was a dick to me?	"Around 2 months ago one evening, I was walking around my dorm when I smelt some weed and so knocked on my friend Adams door to see if he was smoking and wanted to hang out. There was no answer so I knocked on another friends room who lives adjacent to Adam, and asked if he wanted to hang out. He wasn't smoking weed but said he would be down but just needed to get changed. I waited in the hall while he changed, and then Adam came out. He asked me why I was knocking on his door and told me to fuck off, went back inside. 

The next morning Adam texted me saying sorry for being rude and it was because he was having sex with someone. I said it  fine but was a bit upset about it and haven't really knocked on for him since.

So last Friday I caught up with my ex girlfriend, Beth, who I dated for around half a year 2 years ago. She is very good friends with Adams ex girlfriend, Tracy (this is important). While catching up and talking about what was new in our lives, I mentioned that I didn't hang out with Adam much anymore and told her about what happened 2 months ago. 

Over the weekend my friends and I all went clubbing, and apparently Tracy mentioned the story to Adam, having heard it from Beth. The next day Adam said that it was wrong of me to tell Beth the story, and that I should have known that she would tell Tracy since they're best friends and the story was embarrassing. I think he wanted me to apologise, but i was a bit pissed off that he was trying to make me feel bad, and made it a point not to, saying that I thought it was funny.

I've been thinking it over a lot and still feel annoyed and hurt that he tried to shame me for doing that. Realistically, I knew Beth would tell Tracy, but is it really my duty to try and protect Adams reputation?
In the past I have joked about it in social situations ('haha Adam remember when X Z Y'), and Adam would be a bit annoyed but laughs it off. I'd grown distant from Adam for other reasons besides the event 2 months ago, but was it really out of order for me to talk to Beth about it? What do you all think?"	Asshole	0	0	3.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

So, i was looking at a school and the kid that was showing me around the school, the guide i guess,  well he was like the awkward kid (which I myself am the exact same tbf), but he was very much into knowing more about me, which I did not find odd because perhaps he was wondering if I would be the right type of person for this school, but soon the conversations kept going until we got into the talk of social media platforms we use and I ofc brought up Reddit which he had never heard of, he interested and I made an account for him and he wanted to know my account, so I gave him an alt accounts name since I barely know him.  He then wanted to know my phone number, for school reasons so that I could message him if I wanted to know anything about the school.  Well once i was about to leave the school he was sure to make sure that I had the right phone number and vice versa,  and later that day he contacted me, I was like ok, then he did it again the next day wanting to know if I found the school enjoyable, then he did it again wanting to know if I wanted to talk, and so on and so fourth, by the 7th time he said somthing along the lines of \*Just so you know, im not a stalker or anything, I just wanna chat\*  And I pitty the dude I really do, but I myself am legit never chatting with people at school and this dude was chatting with people more then I when I was with him, so I was like \*look man im not really up for the chatting stuff\* ,  Well then he said lets go to the movies or somthing, I was like nah,  he basicly was not getting the idea that I dont wanna talk, so I ghosted him and while doing so he reconfirmed that he was infact not a stalker and such before finally giving up...

c1lx2a	2019-06-17 10:26:14		AITA for not calling CPS on my 2nd cousin's family, even though their children are not being taught how to read?	"Ok, to start, this family is super religious, and are also generally very nice people. They have many kids, but the oldest is 10. They (the husband really...) have chosen a life of organic farming while selling at farmer's markets, and they're quite good at it. They live very very simply, but the family provides a healthy and safe place for the children to grow up. I'm not around them all the time, but the impression I get is that they spend most of their time farming with the kids, crafting, and the parents give them Bible stories.

Last family reunion we became aware that this family isn't teaching their kids how to read. They were very proud of their parenting method of only teaching them farming and crafting, which the kids really do like to do. They said they do plan on teaching them how to read eventually, but now is not the right time. They didn't seem to have any pressing need to teach them to read. They're proud of their homeschooling methods.

The oldest is 10. I'm not sure how much longer you can wait before you risk your children to never really being able to read at an adult level for their lives. What is surprising to me the most is their lack of urgency to get the children to read, just so that they can read their own Bibles. They seem to be choosing their children's livelihoods for them.

So, AITA for not calling child protective services on them? I know that when you homeschool, you're still required to teach your children a minimum of things. Surely they're neglecting this responsibility. That being said, the household is a loving, reasonably empathetic and nurturing, home. I chose not to call CPS, and to wait a couple more years to see if they really do get around to it. AITA to the kids for making this choice?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Lately I've (23F) been experiencing some symptoms of a brain tumour and it's all been a bit scary. I already have severe anxiety and am under a lot of stress, so it's been a bit overwhelming for me. 

Today I had my MRI and I FaceTimed my boyfriend (24M) to show him what it looked like. The conversation was NOT ""hey i'm really panicked/worried, let's see if we can find tumours before my doctors appointment tomorrow"". But instead, I called to show him what the video of the MRI looked like and how the video/images of my brain was interesting/cool.

While showing him I realised he wasn't paying any attention whatsoever and was distracted by his laptop.

I got really upset because he wasn't paying attention when the topic of what we were talking about was serious, even though the conversation tone itself wasn't. He says i'm overreacting and I should have told him that it was a serious topic so he could give me his full attention.

In the three years that I've dated my bf, I've never met his mother. This isn't on purpose - she just moves around a lot and the few times he's been able to go see her I've had something come up on my end.

Despite never having met me, his mother decided to spread a rumour to anyone in the family who would listen that I'm the reason he dumped his last girlfriend (not true) and that he was moving to a new city to get rid of me (also not true, we moved here together for my work).

I was very upset about this. I expected an apology from her and my bf told me to drop it since she apologized to him after he called her about it. She has also taken my bf's cards and maxed them out and ended up getting him blacklisted a few years ago - which is relevant later in the story.

My bf says his mom is not malicious, she ""just doesn't think"". I strongly disagree.

Fast forward a couple of months from that drama and my parents come visit us at our new place. They tell me they're getting divorced. I get horribly sick at the same time (I'm still sick right now) and I'm overall just having a shit weekend.

I see on Facebook that my bfs mother is planning to move to our city, to be with her sons. (His brother also lives here)

My boyfriend and I talk about my parents splitting today, and he says that my mom takes joy in hurting people. He follows that up with ""my mom is not like that"". I get upset and bring up the stuff she did. He says it wasn't to intentionally hurt anyone, it's just because - and I interrupt him and say his mother is a cunt. I'm horrified that I said it, but there it is.

I then tell him I dont want her staying with us when she moves up here because I don't trust her not to steal my cards. We have a massive fight.

I apologize for calling his mother a cunt and he says ""I don't care, I don't believe you"" and leaves.

c1lr0o	2019-06-17 10:04:06	malakasinat	WIBTA if I reached out to my husband's ex?	"My husband and I have been married for two years. Prior to our relationship, he had been in a 4-5 year relationship with another girl. My husband is very protective of me, and we came to a mutual agreement that we would be mindful of respecting each others wishes in regard to the opposite sex. This meant mainly no contact, which we were both fine with.

A few months into our marriage, I found out that his ex regularly reaches out to him. And then I found out that they had talked on the phone a few times, once for almost an hour. He had kept this information from me, which is what upset me. It made me feel like he had something to hide. Initially, we fought for a while every time she would reach out, because I felt like he was being a hypocrite. He will avoid talking to girls with the exception of his ex? It was odd to me.

Finally after some time, he told his ex that it was inappropriate to keep talking because he's married and that it was offending me. He told her he wouldn't be responding to her anymore, but that he wished her well. About a month later, she reached out again.

This triggered over a year of her making attempts to contact him. His phone, Facebook, Viber, etc. He blocked her whenever she tried a new app. A few months ago she messaged him on Viber from a completely different number (because he has her blocked) and it said, ""I know you've been avoiding me for a while, but I was thinking of you because I had a dream about you.""

I was livid because my husband doesn't see it as a big deal, and he doesn't see that she is purposely trying to get into his life. At this poi t I had already asked multiple times to reach out to her. I felt like I had every right. After discussung it, we thought the best response was to ignore it. But I warned him that she would respond in anger at his silence, because her ""dream"" message was her displaying herself and he would be rejecting her. I was right, the next day he woke up to a message that said, ""Lol I thought it was only women who were faithful after marriage.""

So now it is a few months later, and I know the routine. She is going to try to reach out somehow. Low and behold, he had a message request from her on Instagram. We blocked it without even reading it.

I so badly want to reach out to her to tell her to stop. It has been two years of me being patient and respecting my husband's wishes to not say anything to her. It is really bothering me. And now I am pregnant so I am taking everything so much more to heart. Would I be the asshole if I reached out to her to kindly tell her to f off?


EDIT: Since there was some confusion due to my poor description of the boundaries my husband and I have agreed on, I figured I would provide some more context to clear up any misunderstanding. We are a couple from two different cultures, and his is more conservative. I did a poor job when saying the blanket statement, ""not talking to the opposite sex"" as we both have guy and girl friends, coworkers, acquaintances, etc. In his culture, men and women do not spend time alone together. This is not a problem for me since I only see my guy friends in group settings, and we rarely text. The same thing goes for him. If either one of us had a very close friend of the opposite sex, neither one of us would force the other to end a friendship. That's definitely not the kind of agreement we made. It just turns out that my closest friends are female, and his are male. We have established boundaries that we are both comfortable with, which is not spending time alone with the opposite sex, and this is to appease his more conservative upbringing. We both have equal say, and he has been flexible in many ways in our marriage as well. We've worked together to blend our lives in a way that is flexible but still holding true to our roots and core values.

**UPDATE** Thank you everyone for your input. I had a conversation last night with my husband about what needs to happen, what is fair and acceptable to me, etc. I will not be reaching out to her, but he will firmly be putting an end to everything. If she continues, we will take it to the next step as needed. I feel so much better and I am happy my husband was so receptive and supportive. Thanks again, everyone!"

c1lpuw	2019-06-17 10:00:05	feathergrins	AITA for leaving a bad tip at a high end restaurant?	"I always tip 20% or more at restaurants, minimum. Tonight tested me.

My boyfriend and I went out for dinner and we had a reservation knowing it was Father’s Day. Got seated immediately, host staff were very nice.

Our server took 15 minutes to get us waters. We ordered cocktails and an appetizer but she took the drink menu with her after we ordered drinks. When my BF went to the bathroom I asked him to find another drink menu on his way back. Our server was on an 8 top and 2 4 tops so I understand she was busy, I get it. 

Appetizer was aaaaamazing. Food was fantastic.

Here’s where I’m really miffed. I ordered crab legs, which yes, are messy. She put our plates down and then all of the sudden she’s behind me and I feel like I’m being choked because she’s putting a FUCKING PAPER BIB ON ME and tying it behind my neck and I’m 100% not ok with this. It makes me feel like a fucking child and I’m working through issues with my therapist with being abused and choked in the past. I almost had a panic attack as my damn food was served. Boyfriend knows about this issue and I gave him the “I’m not ok what the fuck” look

I rip the bib off as soon as she leaves and we both cool down, I’m hangry as hell.

More drinks come and our server makes a comment saying “Oh, you took your bib off” and gives me a pouty face. I said “well it’s really constricting”. She asks if we need anything else and we say more napkins. They didn’t come.

As we’re nearing the end of dinner I need to use the restroom to pee and also wash my hands from eating crab. I do so. Our server later comes over and asks if I want a hot towel and I said “no, I already went and washed my hands, I’m alright, thank you.” And she seemed confused and miffed as all getout.

Dinner ends and I ask for the check. She gave the check to my boyfriend but once again, my treat so I put my card in it. Takes another 10 minutes for her to pick it up. When she brings it back she puts it in front of him and says “wow I love your card color! (Rainbow tye dye my bank offers for debit cards) It’s very unique.” I snatched it as soon as she set it down and said “Yep, it’s mine, thanks!” and signed the check in the most girliest signature I could. I left a cash tip of 18% MINIMUM I would ever do. As we were finishing our drinks she picked it up and I saw her count the tip then look at the overall check.

I’ve never tipped this bad before and I feel like a POS after talking to friends that are currently or have been servers.

c1lp0m	2019-06-17 09:56:51	nyctaginaceae	AITA for using my father and letting him think we are on good terms when actually I'm thinking of going no contact	"Sorry for my English, I have yet to sleep. I'll try to keep it short.

My father is a massive dick who has emotionally abused me and threatened to physically abuse me as well.

My mother died some years ago and has left me an apartment which I rent to tourists. Since I moved to another country 2 years ago my father has been taking care of all the tourist associated business. I know he does this because partially 1) he does love me and more importantly 2) he wants to stay in my good graces because he hopes I will move back (surprisingly he has no friends and his life is empty).

I won't move back. I would rather beg on the streets than live anywhere close to my father. I ended the renting contract with my tourist renting agency thingy so this is the last year we will have tourists staying. I don't know what I will do with regards to my father after this tourist season. I talk to him once every two weeks now, I'm hoping to push that to max once a month.

I know he is helping me with the tourists because he thinks we are a family and he hopes we will eventually live  together happily. While I think it's perfectly fine to lead assholes on, I'm a grown up and if I wanted to I could find a way to deal with the tourists myself. Am I the asshole for  letting my father help me knowing that I might never speak to him again after I'm done needing his 'services'? Am I the asshole for thinking that he owes me at least that much?"

c1lmlh	2019-06-17 09:47:18	brotherpapi	AITA for being annoyed that I was excluded on Father's Day?	"I only made this account to make this post and I'm not super familiar with Reddit so bare with me re formatting and that. 

Before we get into my potential assholery, some background: I [25M] have a niece who is 6 years old. My older sister [30F] was not in a good place when she had her daughter. Namely she had a severe drinking problem and was heavily involved with a lot of drugs and just some very sketchy people. To avoid my niece being put into the care system after several CPS visits, I took her in shortly before her first birthday. Eventually, my sister gave herself a shake, got her life back on track and got my niece back fulltime two years ago, though she still spends a lot of time with me as my sister is now an ambulance dispatcher so works funny shifts sometimes. My niece is absolutely the apple of my eye and I love her more than anything. Since I raised her for basically the first four years of her life, she and I have always hung out on Father's Day. I'm not arsed about getting gifts or anything like that, but I'll ususally take her to the aquarium or to see a film or something and just spend the day with her. 

So here's the situation. This year, no real plans were made for Father's Day but I'd mentioned in passing about my sister just dropping my niece in with me whenever and she said alright. She was a no show. I tried calling her a bunch of times, to no avail. Eventually, she calls me back at about 10pm last night saying she's sorry she missed me but she'd been super busy. I said it's fine and asked what she'd been up to, and she told me she'd taken a ""Father's Day daytrip"" down to London with her new man (of around 6months) and my niece, our brother and his wife and kids and our parents. I asked how come I wasn't invited and she said because it was a Father's Day thing and I'm not a father. I got a little irritated then and pointed out that I always hang out with my niece on Father's Day, and that it's kinda important to me because I took care of her for four years. My sister shot back saying it's not ""Uncle's Day"" and that she has a stepfather to spend Father's Day with now. I got kinda huffy and ended the call. Later got a text from my brother telling me I'm being a weird entitled tosspot and that if I want to celebrate Father's Day I should have my own kids, and a slightly kinder one from mum saying she's sorry I felt left out but this was a ""dads trip."" 

Idk. I just feel kinda miffed that I've essentially been pushed aside for a man who's been in her life for six months. I'm not like supremely angry or anything and I'll get over it, I just don't think I'm being entitled by expecting to at least be informed of what's going on on a day that's usually my day.

c1lmia	2019-06-17 09:46:56	TooLazy_C	AITA for kinda/maybe ruining my grandparents 50th anniversary	"Some back story: My grandmother and I are extremely close, she's my second mom. She is also known to complain about everything. We could give her $500 in cash and she would probably complain that it didn't come with a diamond. She is extremely picky and throws a fit if things don't go her way, and always complains that she hates whatever party is thrown for her. 

So my mother and her siblings decided to plan for my grandparents 50th anniversary. It's a huge deal and I'm very happy for them, but I'm not part of the decision making at all. 

I decided to go see my grandparents as a routine visit and she starts asking about this party. I even tell her at the time that I have no idea what's going on. My best friend is a witness to everything happening.

Grandmother: ""Why does the party have to be at your house? Why can't it be here?"" I reply that my mother's house ""is bigger for the whole family"". 

She then shouts, ""Who is coming?!"" I tell her that I wasn't sure, but there were talks about a family members parents going as well. My grandmother yells that she doesn't want the mother of said family member to be there. Fine, whatever, but I remind her that's just what I heard.

She tells me how one of my uncles/aunts want to have all these fun activities and how she's mad that they aren't doing what she wants. This went for a while. In the car, my friend suggested that I mention this incident to my mother and I agreed.

This whole time, my mom was under extreme stress from work. I mean possibility-of-her-being-homeless kind of stress. She cried to me about her fears while pulling weeds from our garden (that same day) just to prepare for this event.

I was extremely conflicted, but I decided to tell my mother what happened, with my friend present in the room. I suggested having her and her siblings discuss with my grandmother about what exactly my grandmother wanted, so she couldn't complain anymore. My mom broke down crying and said she just couldn't handle this stress. She texted her siblings and said she was out, and that she would take them to dinner instead. Days after this, my grandmother called and yelled at me for the first time. She said I was basically lying and she never said that. I told her that my friend backed up everything I told my mother, but I never said to cancel the party.

After this, my grandmother told other relatives that I told my mother she never wanted the party here. I only know this because I talked with my uncle today. He said that I started this and my grandmother never said any of what was said. Apparently she wants the party here, wants the fun activities and especially wants that family members' mother to be there now. The party is going to be held at a different family member's home.

I felt deeply embarrassed and ashamed, because now the family views me as a liar. I'm not a liar - I was looking out for my own mom. Now my uncle is mad at me and I feel like a complete jackass. I honestly can't tell if I actually fucked up this time."	Not the A-hole	0	0	299.0	50.0	0.0	0.0
c1lmfi	2019-06-17 09:46:35		WIBTA for being mad at my roommate for going on a trip.	I know the title suggests I'm selfish but it's not so much I'm mad at her for going without me. She's visiting friends she hasn't seen in a couple years and I'm glad she gets to see them . But she also doesn't have a job and I know she's beens looking but she could admittedly try harder to find one so I brought this up to her but she told me the same thing she always does that she's trying hard but I explained to her that if she was trying hard she wouldn't be going on a trip. Cause she had a job a week ago but she quit (I'm not holding that against he she didn't have a choice) so know I'm stuck having to pay the power bill and rent for the next two weeks and I don't know maybe it's just the stress of all the bills being on but I've just been upset with her for going I feel like she chose to have fun instead of taking responsibility and find a new job. Maybe I'm overreacting I don't know. I mean she's my best friend and I love her like a sister but it's not the first time I've been solely responsible for the bills and maybe I'm just getting tired of it. Also she says if the role was flipped she would be happy for me but that happened a month ago, I went on a trip that she wasn't aloud to but I left my car (which is our only vehicle) so that she could visit her family who live about 3 hours away while I was gone. I just don't get it I feel like she forgets some times that I help her as much as I do. Which of course I do not mind helping her she's had an incredibly hard live as have i so i try tp help her as much as i can as does she. Also she has been having alot  of medical issues and i feel even worse for being upset cause i want her to be able to have fun shes had a rough couple of months and I'm just trying to find the right avenue as to not upset her but maybe I should I don't know what to do.

Yesterday was Fathers Day and I have two wonderful little girls. Now, if I had my drothers I would have been a lazy slob yesterday. Maybe I would have liked sex yesterday but nope, didn’t happen.

Instead of that, yesterday afternoon we had to ride about an hour away and spend the afternoon awaiting going to have dinner with my Father in Law. I wasn’t thrilled, but I didn’t say anything and went along with it because he is her Father. She prepared him a really nice gift too.

Aside from the fact he insulted his son the second he was in earshot and was rude to the waitstaff, he also reinforced he expects similar treatment on Grandparents Day.

It all left me a bit, well, disappointed. I think my wife would have been pissed if I insisted we have Mothers Day with my mom instead of celebrating her. Again, I made no mention of my feelings to my wife, because in part I don’t know that I should be feeling this way.

"[Original Post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bk5lj6/aita_for_wishing_my_friend_24f_didnt_follow_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

So it has been 6 weeks since my last post and a lot has changed! The general consensus from people on here was that everyone sucked in the situation, and the best thing to do would be to find a new place. 

After the initial annoyance of realising we would have to find a new place I contacted my employer to ask if my bf and I could move to a new place since they pay for our accommodation, citing some unelaborated ‘challenges’ as being reason for moving. 

However my bf and I were away for a week when I sent the email, and my employer ended up telling Amy we were wanting to move out before we had the chance. 
I received a message from my Amy and apologised for not telling her and we spoke to her about it when we were back. My bf and I didn’t go into any detail with her about why we were leaving due to the fact that we work together, but also in past observations of her she doesn’t take ownership for her behaviour and can’t admit when she’s wrong. 

Now my bf and I are living on our own in a really nice, modern studio apartment that has sea views and we can hear the ocean from our room. So peaceful. I am also now realising our relationship was on the brink before we moved out on our own due to my anger and the lack of privacy. Now I’m the happiest I’ve been in our relationship. 

As well as this since my original post, a few weeks ago I contacted a good friend/ex flatmate of Amy with my concerns about her. This friend then told me she was treated in exactly the same way by Amy, and feels mentally more positive knowing it is Amy who is the problem.
Also (and the reason I posted this today) my boss came to me this afternoon and brought up a huge raft of concerns she is having about Amy as an employee. My boss said she’s always in the office demanding things, she is pushy, expects a lot from them, isn’t doing her job tasks properly and asks to leave work early because she apparently has no work to do - while the rest of us leave late trying to keep up with all the work. 

Since having some space and now speaking to other people about Amy, I am realising she’s not someone I can consider a true friend. However I will remain polite to her while I have to be around her still. 

Thanks to everyone who made me realise this wasn’t a good situation to be in and suggested we move out. 
We are so much happier now."	Not the A-hole	0	0	24.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

c1liss	2019-06-17 09:32:32	giggseyyyyyy	AITA for not wanting my Mom at graduation?	"I'll try be concise. I dropped out of college at the end of year 3 of 4 when i was 23 due to health issues. I remember that was the lowest i had felt in a very long time. My family, instead of showing support, proceeded to give me the silent treatment and kick me whilst I was down. I swore to myself at the time that I'd get better and start college again, graduate and not call any of my family to graduation. This was in 2014.

Fast forward 5 years, we've been through a lot at home. The relationship with my mother further soured over my sister's (now ex) abusive boyfriend who I never approved of but my mother wanted my sister to marry because in our bullshit culture, having an unmarried daughter in her 30's is taboo. It eventually all climaxed one night and he got arrested and isn't ever coming back into our lives hopefully.

I just finished college (another 4 years), find out graduation is in July and my mother is asking about tickets. I remember the promise i made to myself and I still feel sour over what happened and would hate myself for giving in. At the same time I feel like through all the misery, I'm denying my family an afternoon out for a somewhat happy occasion and given the shit we've been through at home it's cruel of me to do so.

c1lhzt	2019-06-17 09:29:15		WIBTA if I wanted to finally apologize to an old friend because I want to date her friend.	"Context: 3 years ago I dated a friend of a friend for a while. The girl I dated (I'll call her Dany) had a very close friend (Karen), who actually introduced us back in the day. After maybe a couple of months of dating, Dany and I stopped dating completely because the relationship wasn't really going anywhere. To clarify, the 'break-up' was fairly peaceful and no hard feelings were present. 

Some time later I had a big fight with Karen, the girl who introduced me to Dany, and we actually stopped talking completely. The fight happened because a rumor in our common circles started to go around that claimed that Karen had kind of sabotaged my relationship with Dany. My first reaction was to take it up with Karen without actually verifying whether it was true or not an I decided to blame her and subsequently cut off communication completely. 

A few years have now passed and Dany has actually started talking to me again, only a few weeks after she broke up with her one year old boyfriend.

Of course the timing of everything has made me think that she might be interested in restarting the relationship, something I'd be up for but there's one thing. Karen and Dany are still REALLY close friends. I honestly haven't thought of talking to Karen about what happened in the fight all those years ago but after some time, long before 'reconnecting' with Dany, I came to terms with it and decided that the whole fight was mainly my fault and wouldn't mind admitting it and apologizing.

Would I be the asshole if I suddenly showed interest to apologize to Karen mainly because I don't want to have any problems if Dany and I happened to start dating again?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1latf	2019-06-17 09:01:21		AITA for not inviting my cousin to my 21st birthday?	"So, to not disclose real identities, I will be calling my cousin ‘Jake’ for the sake of this post. Jake is the son of my mum’s sister and we didn’t exactly grow up together, but we certainly were around each other a lot growing up. When I was around 8, my family moved across town (1 and a half hours away), so we hardly saw that side of my family apart from at Christmas and Birthdays. 

Now, Jake was always a troubled child. He was constantly abusive, violent, disruptive and disrespectful to anyone he came across. There’s not a time I remember growing up where he didn’t hurt someone around him. I remember when I was 15 I wrote in my journal how unsafe I felt around him... needless to say, at 20 years old, his behaviour hasn’t changed. The kicker of this is that he has never been held accountable for any of his actions. 

Around last year some time, we reconnected at my dad’s 50th. He seemed to have matured as I hadn’t seen him for 2 years prior to this (spoiler: he wasn’t mature). I became close friends with his friend, and Jake started dating my younger sisters friend. This caused us to start hanging out as a group and things were fine for a while. Long story short, the environment became toxic once Jake started dabbling in cocaine and ice. My sister and I stopped hanging out with him and his girlfriend because of this, to which he grew angry about. 

He started abusing my sister and I by sending us texts calling us scum and saying we were c*nts. That was my last straw so I cut him off for good. Now I have my 21st next month, where I will be inviting his mum, my grandparents and my other cousins/aunties/uncles, but will request for him to not be invited. I’m not sure if I will request it formally, or will just invite his Mum without his name on the invitation. AITA for this? Thank you.

c1l9fd	2019-06-17 08:55:43		AITA for body-shaming girls from my school?	"A little something you should know before reading this, English isn’t my first language and I haven’t slept for the last 20 hours, so excuse my grammar and spelling mistakes if there are any.

ever since I was 3 I have been constantly moving because of my dads work. I am from the Middle East but when I was 3 my father had to transfer to Australia. We spent 4 years there, then came back. We only stayed for another 4 years then went back to Australia for 3 and a half, later on moving to the Netherlands, Germany, and England. 
Because of all the moving, I became incredibly insecure and socially awkward. I can never start a conversation and would only talk if needed. 
Anyway, last July we came back to the Middle East and I was a 2nd year in high school. Now, people here love to talk. People I had never met knew who I was and that kinda annoyed me. So, since I don’t talk much, everyone pretty much thinks I’m full of myself and tbh, if that’s what it takes for them to stay away from me, then so be it. 
Something I hate however, is when people don’t like to say those things to my face. Like, what are you so scared of? Me actually talking back? You know I wouldn’t do that. 
So there were three girls who were a grade below me, all of them quite chubby. They were whispering somethings about how I’m “actually a slut, but doesn’t want to show it.” I found this funny and giggled with my friends about it. But then they started talking about my friend, my friend is actually really sweet and incredibly shy so it seriously pissed me off that they were making fun of how she ran or talked.
I raised my voice so everyone near us could hear and said “wow I didn’t know we were being featured on ‘We Bare Bears’!” (It’s a cartoon about three bears on Cartoon Network) one of the girls was silent for a bit but then started tearing up. I was later called to the principals office and was told that those girls were “ill”  I didn’t talk to them until I was on my way home and sarcastically said “you guys are actually sooooo skinny! Don’t think about what I said earlier too much, okay?” Then went home.

c1l8s6	2019-06-17 08:52:58		AITA for telling my GF I only want me and our kids to go to church once a month at most?	"So my (22M) GF (19F) goes to a black catholic church. My family was traditionally catholic although my Fathers side in particular my great grandparents who were of Mexican descent were huge catholic church goers. However, my great grandfather was a very practical man and introduced me as a young man to atheism which I took to well. However when I was about 3 years old to 7 years old my parents were going through a huge evangelical reborn christian thing which promptly ended when they found out going gambling for days on end and leaving their 6 year old alone wasn't so Christian. We interpreted the Bible literally and I tend to have issues with most modern casual Christians who get in my face which usually doesn't happen I totally respect peoples religions and I don't preach atheism do whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt others.

I'll admit I prefer religious people who actually follow their beliefs as opposed to what most people seem to be in the US which is just people who follow reasonably good morals and say their Christian because they believe in God... but you know Adam and Eve weren't real and the book is really more parables than anything else. Once again people are free to do it. It just gets on my nerves when *they* tell *me* about Christianity. My GF likes to talk about how we'll raise our kids a lot and I don't mind. She's also a very casual Christian. She only goes to church on holidays doesn't actually follow any of the rules but she really gets on my nerves because she's hypocritical. She hates sex before marriage and will make facebook posts about how abhorrent it is and yet has sex. Y'know... with me. She'll talk about how drinking is wrong and I shouldn't have a beer on Friday nights yet on facebook she has pictures of herself getting absolutely smashed while in the Carribean which her mother confirmed she was absolutely smashed. I know she means well but I feel like she's a hypocrite

Anyway a few days ago she said she can't wait to have kids so she'll have a reason to go to church every Sunday. I told her I respect her religion but I really think it'd be best to either raise our kids not going to church so they can choose when they get older or bring them every month  or every other week as long as they understand its more for connecting with her mothers family and they don't have to worship if they don't want to. She's usually calm but for some reason she went ballistic and told me that she wouldn't be raising non-believers and that they can do they want when their 18 but while younger they'll be and I quote ""the default"" and then called me an asshole for wanting to force my children to be like me to which I responded we could teach them about God and the bible if we don't force it on them. I had a biblical education which is the problem it indoctrinated me into one way of thinking where I really feel I should've had a choice.

Back to grad, it was a typical prom dress, makeup, hair type of day with lots of pictures, I ended up winning an award for $500 to go towards post secondary for excellence in english and my dad asked if I could cash that in for money to go towards modelling portfolios, he told me he’s been looking for modelling agencies for me because I have “great legs and a nice body”, I told him I didn’t want to be a model and that I wanted to be a social worker, he continued to bash social workers and told me it’s too hard and said he’s found a modelling agency near his house. He’s been very belittling to my academic achievements and won’t quit mentioning my body and looks and I’m beginning to become very uncomfortable showing my body around him. I know if I were to tell my mom she would confront him in the worst way and there would be a huge fight in the family so I don’t know if I should let it slide and keep hiding it (he doesn’t visit very often anyways) or if I should tell someone. (he’s also been talking about how he’s glad I’m skinny like him and not fat like my mom and talking about how fat she is his whole trip so I’m worried that word would get to my mom and she’d be devastated, just to make everything more complicated.)

c1l6ch	2019-06-17 08:42:39	Flying-Armbar	WIBTA if I took advantage of my dad in order to get a free car?	"I probably sound like the asshole from the title but hear me out because I’m genuinely 50/50 on what I should do.


For a bit of context my parents divorced when I was 2 years old and I’m 19 now. They first met when they were about 4 years old in kindergarten and were close throughout high school and were considered “cool kids” who went out and partied, did drugs etc. Once they had my older brother and I my mother stopped all the drugs and was and always has been a perfect mother to us, but my father stayed in that track, eventually causing my parents divorce when our house got raided for drugs due to him dealing.


Needless to say I didn’t really get to know him much as a kid, maybe seeing him once or twice a year up until I was 12 when we moved interstate because my mother wanted my brother and I to know our father better. At first this was fine but as I grew up I realised he was and always will be addicted to drugs which I don’t have any time for. When I turned 16 I went from seeing him every weekend to every 2 weeks, then to every month and so on until now I barely ever see him, maybe every 2 or so months.


After his father (my grandfather) died he inherited a fairly large amount of money, enough to buy a large property about an hour away from where I live. He also promised to buy me a car for my 18th birthday which he did but he ended up crashing it not long after buying it. It’s been about a year since that happened and he always said he would buy me a new car but I feel bad taking his money because honestly I don’t like him and don’t want much to do with him. 


My mother is pressuring me to take the car/money as he didn’t pay much child support when I was younger so she believes I’m entitled to take what ever I want. In a way I get that because I resent him for breaking apart my family all those years ago and I feel he owes me, but I don’t even want to talk to him let alone rely on him.

We had made plans to see eachother that whole weekend, so we could have a nice little private celebration. Now she got offered a trip to NY with her mom and aunt, in that very week. (She'll be going from Tuesday till Tuesday. With that weekend inbetween.) Normally I'd be very happy for her, and to be honest I am happy for her. But she had completly forgotten this thing we planned, and she now say that she want's to cancel for me, but she isn't sure if she'll ever forgive me if she did. If I ask her to cancel, or if we talk about it, I'm just not sure who is fucking up here.	Asshole	0	0	323.0	49.0	0.0	0.0

We exchanged numbers, you all probably know how it usually works nowadays. She(18) is a lovely and nice girl. We talked for a bit and after a while she told me that she is still a virgin. No biggie, everyone has to start somewhere right? While flirting with her I(20) brought up that I could be teaching pretty much everything that I know. She was pretty excited about it. However last night as we talked before making out she brought up the fact that she didn't like how her vag looked like. I have only felt hers once before and it was during night time outside (just fingering, nothing else). So I didn't really see it before however I knew what was coming up. And she is correct, it doesn't really look appealing to me for being an outie. By telling her that I will teach her we even brought up stuff I could do to her so she knows what I would be able to do on other girls like giving head to her or doing 69 (eventhough I haven't even done it myself yet lol) and all kinds of stuff. The question now is, WIBTA if I decide not to do these things to her eventhough I kind of told her I would do exactly that? Would it be better if I talk to her about it or if I just pretend not to do it?


EDIT: I only talk about not wanting to give her head. I think most people misunderstood what I ment with going down. I happily do other things to and with her

EDIT2: Eventhough you lovely suggestions told me to ""just grow up"" and ""don't do stuff with women if you aren't mature enough"" I choose the path suggested by others. Just trying it out. I think I was more afraid than anything. Wasn't half bad and she enjoyed it. I still need to work on doing it better however I still have to thank for your discussion. I salute you you lovely redditors!

c1l39r	2019-06-17 08:30:03	jalapenodustpan	AITA for expecting my friend to pay me back after she made a mistake that lost us money?	"A well-known singer is coming to my country, which doesn’t happen a lot. She is playing two shows. One in my town, and one in another town about 4 hours away. It’s been advertised heavily, and tickets were predicted to sell out very quickly. My friend said she would buy the tickets for both me and her (I gave her the money for my ticket), as I had a shift at the time the tickets went on sale. Tickets went on sale at 12PM yesterday, and sold out in 2 hours. 

She manages to snag us tickets for $160 USD each. Life is good. Except then she sends me the confirmation email and I see she’s accidentally ordered tickets for the concert in the other town. She dumb. 

We decided we’re still going to go to the concert and these are our options: 
- We could either drive to the other city and stay the night, which will cost around $130 USD extra each. 
- Or we can sell these tickets and buy new ones from resellers, which the markup will probably equal to between $200-300 per new ticket. 

I think that no matter which option we choose, my friend should pay the difference, as it was her mistake that lead us to having to fork out more money for this concert. AITA for expecting this of her?"	Asshole	0	0	115.0	54.0	0.0	0.0

c1l2v4	2019-06-17 08:28:25	Colby5874	AITA for taking back the Xbox 360 I gave my younger brother on his birthday?	"My brother is 9 years old.  His birthday was 3 weeks ago, but for the past year, he has become addicted to playing games on his kindle fire.  Now, I've had this old Xbox 360 for 7 years, I've poured months into it.  I have at least 30 to 40 games for it, and I've enjoyed having it.  I loved playing all my games but two years ago I bought an Xbox One with some cash that I had been saving for a while, and the Xbox 360 has been collecting dust on my TV stand.  I felt sorry for my younger brother only having a kindle fire at his age when I owned a PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS when I was 9, and his birthday was soon so I decided to give him my Xbox and all of my games.

Skip forward to the day of his birthday, I have the Xbox wrapped up.  He opens it up and his face gleamed with pure joy.  He put the box down on the table, ran up to me, hugged me and said thank you.  After the party, I walked into my younger brother's bedroom and showed him how to hook it up to the small TV he has.  I showed him how it worked and watched him load up his first game of Skyrim.  For the next week, he was glued to that thing.  I occasionally walked in to see how he was doing and helped him along in his games, and by the end of the week, he had the console down pat.  After that week had ended, I had a long-planned camping trip with some friends.  I left home for two weeks, and today, I returned back home to the most infuriating moment of my entire life.

I walk into his bedroom, the first thing I see?  My younger brother, playing it with disks and game boxes thrown EVERYWHERE.  I raged.  I shouted at my brother, ""GIVE ME THE CONTROLLER, NOW."" Of course, he puts on an innocent face and says that the box that the games were in fell off the table and he didn't pick them up yet.  Complete bullshit, the box was still sitting on the table.  I looked at him, jerked the controller out of his hands, walked over to the Xbox, unplugged it, and took it right back to my room.  He ran off crying at my mom saying that I took it.  My mom comes in my room saying, ""You can't take Xbox back!  You gave it away, making it no longer yours!"" I, of course, responded saying, ""Hey, he has my games thrown all over the floor.""  She looks at me and says, ""If he wants to break the disks, he can.""  I refuse to give it back to him.  My brother has been crying for the past day that he wants ""his"" Xbox back.  My childhood was pretty much destroyed right there, some of my favorite games of all time such as Skyrim and Minecraft were scratched so bad that they were unreadable.  The rubber pads on the joysticks are ripped off, and the box for the Sims 3 looks like it was stepped on because it's crushed.  I trusted him, and now I regret it.

My mom is saying that I've ruined his day and his birthday (even though it happened three weeks ago) by taking it back, and my grandma is saying that I was being an asshole by taking it back because I should've have expected him to do this since he is only 9 years old.  


Edit: Thank you to all who pointed out that I was in the wrong, I now see how badly I overreacted to that situation.  I went through and tested all the disks, only 8 disks are scratched unreadable.  I talked it over with my mom and were going to trial him with the 1 game at a time rule (suggested by a few of you) .  I've done apologized to him, but he still really doesn't want to talk to me.  I'll update again tomorrow on how the 1 game at a time trial goes, but until then, be happy that I've now realized my mistake."	Asshole	0	0	33.0	11.0	0.0	0.0

c1l1uv	2019-06-17 08:24:24		AITA for celebrating fathers day more than mother's day?	She used to be so loving before my sister was born. Once my sister was born, it all stopped. My mom was abusive as I grew up, her punishments were extreme. My sister (21) and I  shared the same clothes ( during our teenage years) with each other. When I would wear her clothes, she would tell me to take it off because it looked better on my sister. My sister had the better, curvier body according to my mom. My mom would threaten me to make sure I didn't tell my dad when she would hit me. I just lived with it. I was calm growing up, I was really scared of my mom. My mom bought us clothes and made dinner everyday, she kept the house clean, she wasn't all that bad the materialistic memories are the only good ones. My mom has changed a lot over the years. I had my son (6) who she loves and is affectionate to. She can still be a very negative person. She judges the way my sis & I dress. She favors 2 of my cousins because they know how to do their makeup & dress pretty. She's always comparing my sister & I to them. She gets mad easily. My dad pretty much kisses her ass all the time. I never held a grudge against my mom, she never apologized for the way she treated us. I still visit my parents at least once a week, my sister and brother still live with them. I usually get her balloons and a gift card for her bday. This past mother's day, I bought tacos (her favorite) and we all ate as a family. She once said that we celebrate my dad more than her on special days. Today, father's day, i took my whole family out to eat. I spent almost $200 on dinner. My son took out hallmark cards for my dad and husband & they were really happy reading them. My mom got mad because my siblings and dad told her to get off the phone to socialize. She got up and left on foot (parents house is 20mins away by car). Soon after she left, the food arrived. I told my dad to ignore it and to eat dinner & try to enjoy fathers day. Told him we could go look for her later and she had a phone that she would be fine. My dad couldn't eat, he felt bad. He left the restaurant to go look for her as he was worried. She does this every time it's his birthday or father's day, she acts out and makes my dad feel bad. My sis, bro, husband, & I were pretty pissed. We all agreed she was being immature & selfish. I try my best to celebrate her & make her feel appreciated but she's just jealous of us being closer to my dad. Deep down i know she loves us but very deep in her heart. AITA? I wonder what i did wrong. My dad drove back to the restaurant after dropping her off at home. We had already finished eating. We ended up taking my dad's food to go, we took him to the movies instead & hope he at least enjoyed that part of the day. I feel so bad for him. Sorry for writing a lot. Thanks!		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1l0jf	2019-06-17 08:19:06	iloveducks22	WIBTA for eating nuts on public transport?	"This is a situation I was in yesterday, I’m now fully fed but wanted to hear other people’s views.

I was on an 8 hour coach journey yesterday and, like the idiot I was, I forgot to pack a lunch/meal (the coach was 12:10-20:25) and ate breakfast at 9:30. 

I don’t know how normal this is, but basically when I have low blood sugar I feel I am going to faint instantly (I wouldn’t actually faint, but it makes everything overwhelming and hard and only added this in to prove it wasn’t just me sat miserable with a rumbling stomach.). So because of this I have snacks in my bags just for emergencies. This bag had a handful of hummus chips and then a homemade “trail mix” (including almonds and cashews).

So I was starving and ate the hummus chips but they didn’t fill me up. I knew I wouldn’t feel faint sitting down but was more worried between when I got off the coach and got to the busy train station to get food if I didn’t eat the trail mix.

The reason I could have been the asshole (and the reason why I decided against eating them in the end) is in case someone had allergies. I don’t know how ventilation works on a coach/train; I know definitely avoid eating nuts on a plane but wasn’t sure. 

It may sound like a dumb thing to put on AITA, but I carry around nuts a lot because they’re a hand snack and I know I’m an idiot enough that this problem could come up again, so thought I would ask here if I’m going to be an asshole if a rip open a packet of almonds on public transport.

c1kzjj	2019-06-17 08:15:05		AITA for not saying hi to people at my school who go to the same guitar teacher as me?	"Okay this has been bothering me for a while. So, in August I started guitar lessons and I switched schools at the same time. Two guys who had been going to the guitar teacher for a while started at the same school as me. Let's call them Joe and Jeff. The teacher told me and them about each other and apparently they were expecting me to just go up to them and like basically be friends. The problem is, I'm painfully shy and I'm terrified of starting conversations. Eventually we happened to have a class together. I don't say anything to them there even though I want to but my anxiety just was through the roof at this point. 

&#x200B;

At the second time we have that class and I still didn't say anything, I can hear the other guy  talking about me like 2 meters behind me. Our teacher hosts concerts where his students play and I told my teacher I wanted to play some Hendrix song and Joe was talking to Jeff how he doesn't believe I could play it (I'm a girl btw) and that he's gonna give me some fucking challenge to make sure if I'm good at guitar or not. Mind you, I had been playing for like a year and Joe probably like 10 years.

&#x200B;

Then like a month passes and I still don't say anything to them but now it's the second last time we have that class. I was sitting in front of them and Joe says to Jeff ""it fucking sucks to play with that person"" loudly two times. Our teacher told us we would play together at the concert. I didn't say anything I just ignored them but I cried in the bathroom after. The next week, while I was walking to that class, Jeff saw me and smiled at me and I just ignored him and looked at my phone cause I thought I just looked stupid and was so uncomfortable.Then like halfway through the class surprise surprise Joe asked me if I go to the same guitar teacher. I was shocked cause I was sure they hated me I couldn't get myself to say anything other than yes and oh cool. It was super awkward. I was planning to say something at the end of the class but I just couldn't get myself to do it. (my anxiety was at the highest it had ever been during this time I had to be off school for like 2 months because of it) They probably think I didn't say anything because I hate them, since now every time I see them at school they  either ignore me or look at me like I killed their mother or something.

&#x200B;

I went to the concert practice. Joe was being fake nice and I was also just trying to be nice just talk something with him, Jeff ignored me completely and looked super mad. I couldn't get myself to go to the concert so I cancelled.

&#x200B;

Was I in the wrong in this situation? Looking back on it I should've just said something to them I wanted to but I just assumed they had no interest in getting to know me.

&#x200B;

tldr: I didn't go up to and say hi to people who go to the same guitar teacher and are at the same school as me now they hate me, am i an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

When we were growing up we clearly had very different attitudes to life, with me working hard and him saying I was wasting my time. Consequently I graduated valedictorian, went to my Berkeley and got a high paying tech job on graduation. My bro worked at retail for a year before going in to landscaping, and complains about it constantly but when I suggest doing something to change e.g. go to college, get some sort of skills, look for a new job he says I'm ""out of touch"" and that ""no one can get a good job in this economy"". Still rents and plays videogames until 2 in the morning. I've got so sick of his constant moaning but generally don't lose my temper.

&#x200B;

That was until last weekend when I had him over to stay. I've been saving very hard and just bought my first home in cash, it is nice but not a mansion and this was the first time I've had him over. The moaning was even worse than usual, went through the usual cycle of blaming his problems on others before saying I'm not talking about this anymore. He then said ""I just got lucky"", to which I completely lost my temper. Called him a manchild, embarrassment and that our parents are probably ashamed etc, then brought up how lucky he was to be born in the US in a middle class area which was followed by him storming off.

  
Haven't bothered calling him but got a call from parents saying I was harsh and that he's just a ""different person"" blahblahblah.  Replied they need to be harsher with him if he's ever going to do anything with his life, they then ended the called. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1kqaj	2019-06-17 07:37:43	thyrsusgrippin	AITA for being an anxious mess all the time?	"My ex best friend (“Bri”) of 7 years recently broke off our friendship. In the final year of uni she started making many new friends which I was fine with (she’s very outgoing while im not). At some point in the semester I noticed that she was speaking to me less in our group chat with our friend and would not say hi to me when I would arrive to class early and save seats for her and all her new friends.

Later during the semester we were partners for a project. I mentioned it to her one day over text bc I was wondering where she was and she blew up at me about not being around when she needed me. I was very confused bc I could not think of any instances of this. A few days later I confronted her about it. She mentioned that I had not been there for her when her mom had a benign tumor. I had no clue that that was emotionally distressing for her, as she has a complicated relationship with her mom (even dismissing her mom threatening to HURT herself in the past, outright insulting her mom, and expressing hatred), she didn’t announce it to us seriously, and when her grandfather passed months prior she laughed it off and sexted at the funeral. Also at the time we shared a work shift once a week and she would drive me home (my house was on the way to hers and im terrified of driving). She complained that I was using her and I wasn’t grateful even tho she offered in the first place. We discussed it in length and I told her I appreciated her very much.

Things went back to normal until her birthday dinner where she would invite multiple friends. The problem was that I had class at the exact same time and I would be an hour late. I intended on going anyway, but I ended up having a panic attack bc of my social anxiety (going to a bday party LATE where I wouldn’t know many people). I went home right after class and didn’t message the group chat about my attack bc I didn’t wanna ruin the party. Bri took that as me ditching her even though I told her after that i wasn’t feeling well (didn’t specifically mention anxiety). After that point she started speaking to me less again. This behaviour made me very anxious, especially as during the last time we hung out she would not speak to me directly. I still suggested we hang out multiple times (we never did).

Christmas happened and we didn’t speak, but we were still partners for that class. I saved seats for her and her friends and when she got there she didn’t make eye contact with me. Later I got a very formal message from her saying she did not want to be my partner anymore and she would switch her partner to be one of her new friends. I did not have any other friends in the same major bc of my anxiety (and she knew this) so I spent the semester alone. She went on to say that i was a horrible friend who doesn’t care and that this was why I didn’t have friends. At this point I asked her for the money she owed me (over 100$) and she refused and proceeded to block me. AITA in all of this?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c1kluk	2019-06-17 07:20:09	heywhatsupfam	AITA for not taking a picture with my husband on our wedding day?	"Background: Ever since my early 20s I hated taking selfies and having people take my picture. I don’t consider myself to have self esteem issues. I don’t know when or why exactly this issue started, it just has gotten progressively worse over time.

My husband and I have been together for 4 years and got married last month. I love him dearly and would do anything for him except one thing.

I hate pictures of myself. In the first month or so of our relationship, I let him take pictures of me here and there but never felt completely comfortable with it. I was honest from the beginning about these feelings, but I did consent to the pictures he did have so he did not know the extreme of what I felt. For some reason, my feelings intensified over time about my disgust for pictures of me. I’ve recognized that the more he admired pictures of me, the stronger I felt about this. After an emotional night of talking about these intense feelings he agreed he would not take a picture of me without getting consent first. He even deleted the pictures he had of me because he knew that would make me happier. That was very hard for him and I acknowledged and empathized with his reaction, but did not change my mind. 

In the future of our relationship, this issue came up a lot. I’ve rejected pictures on vacations and outings and group photos. He would ask politely and I would decline every time. He would move on quickly but still I could tell he was sad every time I did. About a year into our relationship, he only took solo photos and stopped asking to take a picture of me or with him. 

Finally, we got engaged. He asked if I could take a picture with him at our wedding. I was feeling overly lovey at the time and said maybe. He was very excited. Unfortunately, when the time came I couldn’t follow through, I was feeling nauseous at the idea of a picture. We got married in a court house with just immediate family and friends who knew how I felt about pictures so I didn’t have to worry about any. My husband, being the angel he is, took the next day to express the sadness he felt about my decision but ultimately decided to move on because he doesn’t want me to feel uncomfortable. 

Basically I want to know, was it wrong for me to not go against my feelings about this?  I did tell him about my feelings early on but I love him and am worried this is effecting him more than he let’s on."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1kl94	2019-06-17 07:17:44	1feral1deafallk9luv	WIBTA? Fiancé is content to exclude me from family vacay.	"Talking about summer plans for next year it came up that soon-to-be hubby’s family would want to go on vacation next summer as a family. We will be married by then, I will be the first spouse to join the fam. There are no formal plans yet but hubby isn’t sure if his parents would pay for a vacay for me. 

He knows they would invite him and he is perfectly happy saying yes and then leaving me home without a second glance back. When I expressed frustration and a want to be included, he kinda just shrugged it off saying it is out of his control. Understandable but is he really just gonna leave me without trying to figure something out? “Oh sorry my parents are taking me and siblings to XY city... but not you. It’s too much to take you too. Bye! Have fun working your high stress job while we play and tell you all about it!”

I would understand not being there due to work and such but not even a consideration hurts me a bit. I feel like a burden already and I haven’t even made it “official” yet. 

Background: in my family the way it is handled is that once married it is a package deal and if parents are paying for a vacay all spouses are invited. Or if it is an expensive destination couples pay for part of their overall bill and parents help where they can. And this is even with me being on limited contact with my family due to opposing views on pretty much every single topic in existence.   

Because of difficulties with my family I fear abandonment and tend to be sensitive to anything resembling such. I seek out and try to build and find acceptance into family like structures because I don’t have one, and didn’t feel a part of my family growing up. I sometimes can’t gauge my reactions well with so much emotion... am I overreacting? Or is it warranted to want to be included as family? 

His family likes me and we have had no issues thus far. They are accepting of me and my beliefs and I am respectful and accepting of theirs. To those who made it this far... thank you and please help a girl out!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I'm not all caught up manga-wise, but I do know a lot of spoilers and keep them to myself. I hate spoilers so I do not reveal anything to anyone unless they really beg for it.

My husband is not such a big snk(shingeki no kyojin)/aot(attack on titan) fan. He thinks the show is good but not great, and whenever the new season comes out since we've been together we watch it. For season 2 it was okay since since he remembered season 1, but for season 3 every episode he has asked me what happened in the past episodes or season 2.

I am getting tired of it. I understand he doesn't remember fully what happens, but I am getting fed up of every week having to explain storylines or aspects of the show that have been explained in the anime. And as I said earlier, I hate spoilers, I do not reveal anything to him and honestly all of his questions are overwhelming. He doesn't want manga-spoilers but wants me basically every episode to explain something to him that he should remember and know! So I basically have to separate manga from anime and rack my brain on how to explain it properly while not revealing anything through emotion in explanation!

Tonight I told him that I was tired of it and wished he would just rewatch the show, read the episode synopsis, or read the manga. He got upset because I wouldn't just give him straight answers to things and I honestly don't get it :\\ like what am I supposed to do at this point?

c1kjol	2019-06-17 07:11:36	Dishsoap12306	AITA for refusing to drive my dad around all the time?	So for some background, my dad got his license revoked over a year ago. He was supposedly going to get it back a few months ago but for some reason they decided not to (I don’t know the details). Fast forward to now. I live at home (I pay for my own food, rent, help out with the bills etc. ) and lately he has been asking me for more and more rides. He has his own business and needs a ride whenever he has a job to do. This is a problem for me for a few reasons; 1) I have borderline crippling anxiety and things like sudden plans or being put on the spot make me panic and 2) I work 100% from home so apparently this means I’m available 100% of the time to give rides (I’m not). So, since I am not only capable of driving but I am home all the time, i am expected to drop everything at a moments notice when he needs a ride (I should mention that Uber is not an option as he has large equipment to transport). There have been multiple instances where I’m busy working and he shows up all of the sudden saying he just accepted a job and needs a ride *right now*. I just can’t keep doing this, it’s taking a huge toll on me. If I say no, he says he understands but I can hear him from the other room pissed that I costed him hundreds of dollars. If I say yes, I’m the one who ends up having to sacrifice work. My mom is 100% on his side saying that they raised me and it’s my job to help our family and they are losing money because of me. I argued that it’s *his* business and *his* fault for losing his license, therefore *he* should be the one to pay the price. This has got my mom royally pissed and she is refusing to speak to me.

Background

December 1st last year I took a new job we both agreed is best for our future and our sons. I had to spend the first year out of the country coming home for two visits. 1 for her birthday and the second for our son's birthday. He is currently 4 will be 5 I'm August. 

Christmas, Valentine's day,and her birthday she received as much if not more out of my guilt got being gone as usual. I didn't receive anything. I didn't mind Christmas because I had just left and told her it is ok. I don't care about Valentine's day and only celebrate it because she wants to. But I thought father's day would be different. 

2 months ago I sent her an email with some present ideas that I've always wanted. Giving her plenty of shopping time. 

Yesterday when video chatting with her and my son he was showing me all of the things he made me at Pre-K. I loved it all and when he was done my wife didn't go for anything to show me. I asked her if she got anything for me and she said ""No, why would I you're not even here"". Not wanting to fight and wanting to spend the time before they left playing my l with my son I just said ""ok"". 

She immediately got extremely angry and defensive. Said I was putting a guilt trip on her hi just saying ok. I told her it just makes me sad because she hasn't gotten me anything since last father's day. 

I tell her all of the time how thankful I am for what she's doing while I'm gone. But being away from her and my son is difficult for me. I love them both very much and the separation has been rough. Her not recognizing me on father's day hurt. 

She says she has been broke but I pay 80% of the bills, give her $500 a month, and oy for any unexpected expenses over $100 for her. She refuses to ever show me her bank account (we don't have a shared one) but constantly complains about being broke. I've done some rough guesses and she should have $1K-1.5K leftover monthly after the bills she pays. 

She hung up on me when I brought up it being a year since she last got me a gift. My son called me back a few minutes later after crying that she hung up on me. I told him it was an accident and she didn't mean to when he called back. Then, when she was ready to leave I was in the middle of saying bye to my son and telling him I loved him and she hung up again without letting him respond to me. 

Since then she has not called me back and I was only allowed to speak with my son for less than 5 minutes in father's day. Normally in Sundays him and I video chat while he plays with toys in his room for at least an hour. I didn't get that. Then they normal call before bed when I'm waking up for work. I didn't get that either.

c1kgas	2019-06-17 06:59:12	khosrove	AITA for wanting to let my bf know that he's going to be home late?	"Yesterday morning my [27F] bf [27M] said he's going into work and he'll see how it goes, but he'll probably be home at around 7-8pm. I come home at 9pm and he's not home yet, which is fine. However it gets around to 11pm and he's still not home and hasn't messaged me that he's going to be late. I'm 90% sure that he didn't work past the 7pm he mentioned, so I've no idea what he's up to since we don't message throughout the day as he really dislikes letting me know what he's up to or messaging in general. Around the same time at 11pm he does finally message me, saying that he's coming home soon and he arrives 30min later. 
AITA for feeling like he should let me know that he's going to be home around midnight instead of 7-8pm like he mentioned he would be? We didn't have any specific plans for the evening, but I still feel like it's considerate to let the other person know that you're going to be home 4hrs later than you said you would or in any case that you're not going to be home until almost midnight on a Sunday. He completely disagrees, saying that it doesn't matter at what time he comes home and that he's just not going to say an estimated time of getting home in the future so that I can't hold that against him. He says that I'm completely in the wrong about feeling that he should message me about stuff like this and that it's fine if he comes home at 1am on any day without giving me a heads up.
We've been living together for only a week for now, so it's all new and I'm not sure how to feel about this. I was under the impression, that letting the other person know what you're up to is the normal and considerate thing to do and I always do, but maybe it's not and I'm just being unreasonable and needy?"

c1kfv3	2019-06-17 06:57:36	shunkse	AITA for not wanting to hang out with an autistic girl...I guess because she's autistic.	"Yeah, downvote me for the title but hear me out

I'm 15, my friends are 16, including Tara, and one is 17. We're all in the same school, minus Tara, who hangs out with us at a local cafe we all frequent

I have a pretty small friend group. I'm friend that makes jokes to get reactions. I do it less and less as I get older, but my friends have known me as saying some things for shock value. So they're not afraid to toss mean spirited jokes my way.There's never any hard feelings.

There's a girl- I'll call her Tara, that frequently hangs out with, she's been pretty clear about being on the spectrum. That's a nonissue.

Problem is she's blunt- she can be rude and self centered. 

A week ago my friends and I were all sitting, having pretty intimate talks. We're fairly close and we disclose some pretty personal stuff with each other. It's how we are. The conversation eventually turns to the fact that I was born intersex- I have male and female sex organs. You may have heard the term hermaphrodite. The topic of discussion: if I worried about how future partners would react to it, and I shrugged, saying I didn't really want to think about it. Tara says, ""Well, I don't think any guy would ever want to be with you after pulling your pants down. Maybe you should fix it before everyone figures out you're gross down there.""

My friends were shocked. I had to put on a brave face, I just laughed awkwardly.

And then yesterday happened. I was sitting with the same group of friends, and Tara joins in, and starts talking about a webcomic. She interrupted me, but I didn't say anything. Soon, the topic naturally shifted towards something else. Tara pulls the conversation back to the webcomic. The friend who was interrupted makes an excuse to leave. Tara carries on keeping the conversation on her webcomic.

After asking one of my friends about her later, they explained that the webcomic is one of Tara's special interests.

my friend suggests I talk to Tara, and I messaged her. I basically told her I was hurt, and why. I don't know her well enough to joke about her, so I never made a joking comment towards her/about her. Tara messages back after an hour:

""Ok""
""You're being too sensitive. If you'd didn't want me to talk about what's between your legs, you wouldn't have told [redacted]""

I wanted an apology, and she said I wouldn't get one.

I understand that her autism may make her act differently than others in social situations. But I don't think I can interact with a person who doesn't apologize.

AITA here? My friends invited me out and said Tara would be there. I said no, and one asked me if it was because she was autistic. I said no, it's because of how she acts. And now my friend group is split 50/50. Half thinks she can be a bit much, the other thinks I'm being a dick. I do tend to be a bit sensitive when it comes to my gender/sex, and I don't know if I'm overreacting or being unfair.

I’m Non-binary and had a GF for half a year. Now, I’ve known my BF for three years and we both had a crush on eachother ever since then, yet I of course stopped crushing on him as soon as I got my GF.  Now, the other day we broke up due to me and her being distant and the relationship being awkward. We never talked much, conversations were awkward and we wouldn’t do anything with eachother. So, I decided to end the relationship. After that, a few hours later I was being comforted very affectionately by my friend, until he asked me out. I of course said yes because this was the person who I had fallen in love with originally and someone who I’d known for ages. Now, I put on my insta story about being taken again. My gf saw this and didn’t like this. She put something on her story that went exactly like this -

This is for my ex, cause i don’t wanna text them. they found someone better, so i’ll say this: i never thought you’d be the type of person that would break my heart like that and then find someone new within 48 hours. we’re different people, but that’s something i never thought i’d see from you. you’re happy, then i am then we’re not friends and I don’t wanna hear back from you. you found someone else, don’t bother texting, I won’t reply.

Now, this made me feel awful. I didn’t mean to hurt her, I was just trying to make myself more happier by actually being with someone who I was happy with. Someone who I talked to more than her and known longer. She also put a few other things on her story like “do u like me?? Jk I don’t care if you don’t”.

TL;DR at the bottom

&#x200B;

Bit of a background story: About three years back I moved into an apartment with my then boyfriend (now fiance). We weren't well off but we were doing okay. We got really good with saving and such and thus moved into a bit of a bigger apartment in a complex. His mom with her three other kids was evicted and they lived by us for four months. This sent us spiraling into debt as she didn't have a job and we went from supporting ourselves to supporting six people with our meager salaries. We are currently living in a flat in someone's backyard on one side of town and still struggling with debt and getting by.

&#x200B;

My friend is living close to work with her fiance and three young children in his Granny's cottage flat where they only pay for electricity, no rent. Recently they got into an accident with their car and have only a bike for transport. They are also struggling. The kids' school is on the opposite end of town.   


She wants me to help transport her kids to their school and back to her home every day for two weeks without paying for petrol. She knows how much we are struggling as well and yet uses passive aggressive ways to make me feel like shit for not offering help. AITA for not helping?

Recently we took down 4 trees in my mother in laws property. Well not really we, basically me. One tree I fully cut down chopped up and moved with a small amount of help. The other 3 were done professionally but I swiped a decent amount for firewood. 

Today my wife's sister decided to just show up and take some. I'm conflicted. Her past is horrible but she's cleaned her act up. She's been kissing my ass basically since she cleaned up lol. I'm pretty tough even on the people close to me. Tough love basically but I don't take people's crap.

Her and her bf will be helping us when we take one more tree down (as long as they show up) this summer so she's considering it early payment, I'm not sure if I want to allow that because of her past.

AITA for wanting to draw a line in the sand and be hard on her for showing up and taking some wood before they did the agreed to work?"	Asshole	0	0	1117.0	75.0	0.0	0.0
c1k5ky	2019-06-17 06:19:16	ta5172019	AITA for not forcing my daughter to call her dad on father’s day?	"(Throwaway)  

  
My husband and I are separated. He is abusive, manipulative, a bully, etc. He likes to intimidate and make threats. A couple months after we separated, he had my phone cut off, knowing that at the time, that was the only way to call me or our daughter. He made no other attempt to contact. Fast forward to Mother’s Day this year - he called the police and had them sent to my mom’s house to do a “well check” because he was “worried.” Sorry but bull crap. He has another woman living with him and she pushed for him to make contact with us. I know this to be true because he accidentally left a voice message with her talking in the background. There are a couple videos that prove they are an item, as well. Anyway, so he’s trying to scare me into forcing my daughter to talk to him. She FINALLY got the courage to tell him she didn’t want to talk to him, so he’s been sending a text every day and she ignores it. I have always given her the choice to do or not do something that might make her uncomfortable. She gets a headache and stomach ache every time she talks to or about him, so I don’t push the issue for her to talk to him. One night he even threatened to call the cops again if she didn’t call him in 5 minutes even after me telling him that she was hungry and just about to eat dinner. Fast forward to 2 days ago - he sent a message saying that he wanted her to call him on father’s day. Then yesterday he left a voicemail saying “you’d better answer saying a bunch of Hail Marys because you’re a terrible person.” He knows that my daughter has the phone more than me, and he sent the cops here on Mother’s Day, and my daughter doesn’t want to talk to him (I reminded her that it was father’s day and she said she didn’t even want to send a message so I didn’t force her to), oh and I’m not catholic lol. So anyway, should I have made her call or send a message anyway? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1k4qo	2019-06-17 06:16:10	canneverrelate	AITA for telling a girl not to bait us with cancer?	"For context, I (M16) am in a group chat with this one girl (F15) that I don’t particularly care for, and some classmates. I don’t really like the girl and some things she’s done, but I try and keep it respectful between us.

The group chat was filled with various chatter. At one point, the girl in question (We’ll call her T) chimes in with a dark message. She goes “This is so sad but someone at our school has cancer.” This immediately grabs our attention for obvious reasons.  We ask if she’s kidding and a couple of guys start to make jokes about who it is ( as in they are saying it’s them or someone in the group), but she confirms she is serious. We keep asking to make sure she is 100% serious, and she is. We ask her how she knows, and she says she just heard it directly from the person while she was visiting. A friend of mine (We’ll call him Z) asks who has cancer. T refuses to tell us. Immediately half of us go “then why did you bring it up?” Z asks a few more times and T says she won’t tell us. A few other get upset with Z, arguing that if she doesn’t want to tell, she doesn’t have too. That’s fair, but she just dropped a bombshell on us. So Z and some others argue that you shouldn’t say something so significant if you don’t want to talk about.

T goes on a rant. She starts saying that she can say whatever the hell she feels like saying and we should get off her back. Others are saying that it’s dumb to say “hey guess who has cancer” and then move on as if that means nothing. T is saying that it’s not her fault that Z wants to know which of our classmates has cancer, which is objectively false because he wouldn’t have known anything about it if she didn’t bring it up (unprompted, btw). Then T starts complaining that we always do this to her. She’s referring to an earlier incident where she posted a picture of something from an ongoing trail involving someone we know on the group chat, then she started complaining when we were talking about the trail that she brought up. We all pointed out that if she didn’t want us to talk about it, she shouldn’t have shown us something we otherwise wouldn’t have seen.

She goes on and on and I finally speak up. I say that it’s stupid to drop a bombshell like that and expect us not to discuss it. I then say that Z is completely in the right for asking for clarification on information freely given by T and that it’s childish and frankly immoral to bait us with someone having cancer then blaming us for wanting info. She loses it, saying that she had the right to say whatever and that she’s “done with all of you” and she leaves the chat. I felt justified but later Z said that we really pissed her off. I felt the incident was entirely her fault, but the group chat is split. I’ve been toying with the thought that while she did bring up the topic, it’s her right to give and decline information when she wants to, even if it’s about a mutual friend having cancer. Maybe I shouldn’t have told her off. AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	1012.0	192.0	0.0	0.0
c1k3n6	2019-06-17 06:12:15		AITA if I don’t pay back my mother the money she lent me?	"TLDR: my mom makes me give her money for my expenses even though I already pay for my therapy and antidepressants along with all my other expenses and my therapist just adviced me to refuse to give them money but dont know what’s the right thing to do :(

So I know how it sounds but please read. 

Hello, so I really don’t know how to start this. 

To give you a bit of context I’ve had depression for 7 years (I’m 23) just started medication two years ago, but due to the lack of progress I decided to go to the psychologist to try to see what’s going on. 

So I started going to therapy 2 weeks ago and talking with my therapist about my constant feeling of guilt we realized that 1. My mother was the main caused for that guilt and 2. She is a really controlling person alongside with my dad. 

I recently had a nose surgery and my mom demanded that I pay a part. Honestly not because she needs the money (the surgery was mostly covered by insurance) but because since I recently got a job I need to start collaborating with money to the household and my expenses.

I make 600 dlls a month... which is nothing. I have to buy myself clothes, shoes, basic things like toiletries and buy my medicines every month. (I’m on anti depressants and they ain’t cheap) I recently graduated and payed for the party, the pictures and all the shalalala that comes with graduating. 

So on top of that my mom says that I must pay her at least 400 for the surgery. I agreed without a doubt but now my therapist told me that I should start making more independent decisions to stop my parents from controlling me so much (I’m 23 and just graduated college) and refusing to pay them would be a start. 

I wasn’t going to follow that advice because it would make my parents upset since I had already agreed to pay and also it would make them be angry at my therapist (don’t want to risk it).  But I feel so overwhelmed by all my current expenses and have been so overwhelmed in general that paying my mom this money has really stressed me out. She also demands that I pay for my food and ubers and guys I just can’t. I have tried talking to her but she said that I shouldn’t go out with my friends so much so I can save money to pay her, but going out and being social really helps my depression (she doesn’t get that even tho I tell her) 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel so alone and a little bit betrayed that the reason I am so stressed is because of my parents. I know I’m an adult now but I also know it wouldn’t hurt them to help me out by not asking me for money and also help me out to pay my therapy or smth so I can save some money.... :( I just can’t stop feeling guilty if I buy something for myself or have a little bit of fun. It sucks.

c1k3ho	2019-06-17 06:11:42		AITA for accusing my friend of stealing?	"Typically when I get home I empty my belongings like my wallet onto my desk. I was waiting for a friend to stop by to come pick up an amplifier I wasn't using anymore. When he finally texted me that he was outside, I really had to pee, so I quickly ran to let him inside and take a seat at my desk while I went to pee.

&#x200B;

After coming back in my room, he handed me my wallet. I figured maybe it had fallen on the floor or something, so without missing a beat just grabbed it and tossed it back onto my desk.

&#x200B;

Then we got to talking about the amp. He hands me the $60 and I put that cash into my shorts pocket that I'm wearing. After, we aimlessly chat about what video games I'm playing lately and some other stuff for about 10 minutes before he says he's late for meeting a girl or something.

&#x200B;

I thank him for stopping by and walk him out to the front door, then go back to my room and take a seat at my desk. I take the $60 from my pocket and go to put it into my wallet. To my surprise, my wallet is now completely empty. Now here is where it gets tricky, I did not have the exact count of how much cash I had in my wallet at that moment. It was anywhere from $180-280 (1 hundred dollar bill and between 4 and 8 $20's).

&#x200B;

Now I'm questioning myself, am I going nuts, did I take my money out? I know I had the cash in there only hours ago when I went out to the thrift shop and spent $5. The last thing I wanted to insinuate was a friend that I trusted and allowed into my home could have taken it.

&#x200B;

I had to be sure. So I texted him: ""Yo \_\_\_ I think I have some money missing from my wallet""

&#x200B;

He instantly calls me and seems kind of upset that I would accuse him of stealing. He gets onto saying how the $60 he gave me was the only cash he had on him, but for some reason he still has $60 in his pocket.

&#x200B;

He was driving so said he would pull over and check more. He started asking me how much money I had in my wallet (which I did not know for sure).

&#x200B;

I told him to be frank with me and not to play games, ""If you didn't have any money on you aside from the $60 you gave me, then just tell me how much money you have on you."" He then said he had $80, and also found another $100 bill. So $180.

&#x200B;

After a little round table he asked if I preferred him to return the cash, which he could not do now (meeting up with a girl), or to just Venmo me now for $180. I opted for the Venmo.

&#x200B;

What makes this worse is I don't know the exact amount it was. If it was truly $180 and he says it was a mistake. Then I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and let it be water under the bridge. But, if it was more than $180, how do I not know he just had no cash, and just gave me $60 of my own dollars back to me.

&#x200B;

He texted me after he sent me the Venmo: ""Sorry for the scare man. Don't do that to a homie ever""

&#x200B;

I've been planning to move overseas with my partner for roughly 2 years and the timing looks like we will have just gotten settled-in in the new country when the wedding is on.

The wedding will be in my home country (18 hour flight from new location) and it will be a destination wedding on the other side of the country away from where our family resides.

We always said that of course we would go if  we haven't moved yet, but that if we have just moved it would be impractical for us to attend (getting leave at a new job, cost of international flights and accommodation, etc).

I told my sister kinda point blank  that it's a pretty good possibility that we wouldn't be able to attend a few weeks back because they didn't seem to hear what I was saying.

Well that blew up and I am coping it from her, her finance, and my mother. Messages telling me im selfish and I'll regret it. 

From my perspective, it's not like we are not doing anything to bad, I know it's their special day but we have been planning our move for a long time as well. This is important for us.

So I, (16F) had joined a forum for a popular online game. I met some of the greatest people and it was such a fun, positive environment. Among many other things, I discovered my homosexuality. I felt supported there like I never had before and I felt like I belonged.

Eventually, I got a discord to easier chat and play games with everyone and again, it was a really nice supportive experience for me. Until one day I’d left my phone out and my mom saw everything. She blew up on me about how strangers on the internet can’t be trusted and how all forums were basically filled with creepy old men.

I was heartbroken and of course, I wanted to say goodbye to the people I had grown to call friends. That’s when my sister saw and proceeded to tell my parents. That ended up getting me grounded for about four months and completely shattering any trust my parents had in me.

I was completely miserable and became extremely depressed. felt alone, and my main source of support was stolen from me. Of course I had friends but I’d honestly stopped completely trusting them once they expressed homophobic views.

It’s been awhile and I now realize they were trying to protect me in their own way, but damn if it didn’t really mess me up. I felt like a shell of the person I was but over time my mental state improved.

She complains about basically everything, yells all the time when something is even off a tiny bit, and blames everyone else for her mistakes. Like she burnt a pot before because she doesn't watch the pot when she cooks and she blamed us because someone should magically always know when shes cooking and be able to watch her food. My dad is the strict asian dad. Short temper, yells and swears. Trying to get better at it but still a ways off. The littlest thing triggers him into rage.

Anyways. So today was fathers day and my grandma forgot. She got upset and started yelling at us, calling us terrible children because nobody told her it was fathers day and how stupid we are. I got a little upset and said ""Stop blaming us because you didn't remember!"" My little brother stepped in and started yelling at me saying ""Hey, don't get mad at her, it's our fault for not reminding here."" I get mad at my brother because I believe we shouldn't be guilty tripped and accepting blame for our actions. So my dad hears me and starts getting mad at me for arguing with my brother. This is when shit goes down.

My dad always goes berserk on me and calls me a stupid fuck. Like when I failed my drivers test he called me a worthless stupid fuck and im a stupid fucking idiot. He also does the blame thing like my grandma (His mom). He forgot his phone at home when he said he'd drive me and my sister to the mall and cussed us out. He said it's all our fault and told us we're fucking spoiled fucks and stupid idiots. So I've always had issues with my dad and I just fucking lose it. I start shouting and swearing at him and he swears back. Just straight fuck bombs. It got to the point where I got a little scared and he just said ""FUCK YOU, YOU UNGRATEFUL FUCK! I DON'T DESERVE THIS!"" and he continued to go off. My grandma tried to get into the argument and told us were fucking stupid so we both told her to stfu. 

Now I'm sitting here after the argument cooling down and I feel bad. I normally don't curse but idk why I just fucking lost it and I'm wondering AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So my fiancé is an in home caretaker and she lives with an old woman who is technically her boss but treats her like and calls her the grand daughter she never had. The woman is a lesbian, she showers my fiancé with gifts ranging from jewelry to copious amounts of revealing outfits. She expects her to try on each outfit and show her how she looks. Refers to my fiancé as her girlfriend constantly. (Imagine if the genders were reversed) Yet constantly nags and yells about how she isn’t doing anything well enough. I’ve never felt like the woman respects our relationship or shows any support of me. The woman hired her ex boyfriend shortly after we got together and treats her like a son. It’s very apparent to me that she wants them back together to keep her little “family” together, she puts them in the same place at the same time. Tried to set up dates between the two. Plans party’s and events around my work schedule to make sure I can’t be there. (They invite girls to them to flirt with him to attempt to make her jealous) Encourages them to hang out and be friends when he has no place whatsoever. He needs to be out of the picture. He’s not healing. He makes lewd comments to her. Flirts inappropriately. Then cries when she leaves to come see me after work. I’m getting sick of it and today we talked about it and I said I don’t want her there. It’s a day to celebrate us and our relationship. She’s never supported the relationship, and even though she supports and loves my fiancé. I don’t think someone who has actively tried to meddle in our lives deserves to be involved in the celebration of our lives together. On top of that our families think she’s batshit crazy and she would go thinking she has the rightful place as part of the family. In no way whatsoever do I feel that’s justified. Plus, we would have to transport her there, take physical care of her. And parade her around everywhere to the point of her becoming the main focus of whats supposed to be our weekend. Then we would have to transport her home before going on the honeymoon. My fiancé says she half heartedly agrees and if it’s going to go down like that I have to take full responsibility (which I will) and tell her myself, but feels she does deserve in part to be there for the love she’s shown my fiancé as an individual.

c1jodu	2019-06-17 05:17:40	ineedathrowawaylol	AITA For not pushing my mother towards a healthier lifestyle?	"So my mom is fat.



She has always been this way for as long as I can remember. And it's not like we really ate unhealthy growing up. My brother and I in high school were both fit and active. We all ate the same food. The biggest difference with my mom (I think) was that with her job she lived a sedentary life and combined with the stress of her position my guess is that she stress ate. 




But that was several years ago. Today, I've graduated college and definitely added some pounds to my frame. I'm certainly overweight. I think my mother also gained weight. But she's in far worse shape than I am. Recently, I learned that she's pre diabetic. She's already had surgery on both of her ankles and although nobody wants to say it - I think they got bad because of how much weight she's carried. Her brother (who was also overweight) recently passed away from a heart attack at 53. All of these things together have made her decide she wants to get healthy. Or so I think.



I've been home recently because I'm helping her move. She's retired from her stressful and well paying job to move out with some of her family in California. I've noticed that she's eating terribly, with lots of carb and fat heavy foods. I've tried to gently adjust her eating habits but it's going nowhere. My brother's approach has been far more direct by calling her out on it but nothing has changed. Whenever she is pressed about it, she says she'll have more time to get better once she's fully moved away and retired. Privately, she has expressed to me that these weight / heart problems are just a genetic thing (almost all of her family is heavy) and there's nothing she can do either way.



My brother has been adamant about trying to force her into healthier choices. Here's my thing: I don't think it's necessarily my issue to try and tell my mom how to live her life. This comes from several places. First, as an overweight person, I find it hypocritical to tell someone to lose weight. Secondly, the power dynamic is such that I don't really feel comfortable telling her to do anything. Additionally, she's tried some weight loss programs in the past but she can't seem to stick to them. And lastly, with her moving so far away, there's no way for me to actually reinforce any good habits or cull bad habits.



Again, my brother thinks I'm being soft, and as such, complicit in her unhealthy lifestyle. I don't really think it's my place to say anything. AITA for not pushing my mother towards a healthier lifestyle?

Then we moved in (a two mom family) with 7 kids - 3 of whom are black. Shortly after that a couple more black families moved in. The old ladies in the neighborhood aren't digging it. When we show up at the community pool they make their grandkids get out. They want to make sure all of our kids are ""really ours."" It's shitty, but not anything new to us. Today we let our two 16 year old daughters go to the pool alone. They have to be 16 to swim without parents. They swam, enjoyed the peace and quiet, and came home about 2 hours later. As they left an older woman stopped them and asked how old they were. They told her and she said she didn't believe them. They were respectful to her and even told her when their birthdays were. She then told them that since we rented our home, we had to follow different rules. Which isn't true. She was just busting their balls for no apparent reason. They get home and they are upset so I head over to talk to her. Straight out the gate, she's nuts. She still doesn't believe how old they are. It's her ""job"" to question all children at the pool. I finally told her to stop harassing my kids. Just leave them alone. But it got pretty loud and heated. She's in her 70's and she bothers EVERYONE in the neighborhood that has kids that come to the pool. After coming home and talking to my wife, I wondered if she doesn't have some sort of dementia. My wife says she's just a nosy old bitch who likes being in everyone's business and being difficult. But I feel bad for getting loud with her. She really is awful though. AITA?"

I’m a part of a discord server that has a sub-chat specifically for venting, recently I’ve been feeling lonely and depressed so I went to the chat and typed something along the lines of:
“I’m so lonely and its getting to me, I’m starting to think that love isn’t real. Who knows, maybe it is just some animalistic instinct of lust and repopulation that humans made a fancy name for.”
And I immediately got a response from someone telling me that it was triggering and that I needed to take is down immediately, they followed up by saying:
“And I’m gay, so I don’t think the ‘urge to repopulate’ is very correct.”
I then posted a message saying that I’d be taking a break from everything because of how unsupported I felt, the person from before attacked me again and called me an asshole since the message was triggering.

Sometime this guy started messaging me, I knew he had a girlfriend and he was a cheater, I messaged him purely to bait him to get evidence to tell his girlfriend. Once I had the evidence, nudes and all (I never sent any) I contacted her mum who assured me she would tell her after all the Christmas overtime. She didn't tell her and now he's messaging me again, I haven't replied this time. So today her mum wanted the photos again to show her, and now she's said she's not saying anything until next week because she's starting a new job, fair enough? But I don't trust that she will tell her, AITA if I tell her next week if her mum doesn't, I know it was a while ago but it's still not right and he's trying to do it again.

c1jk59	2019-06-17 05:03:06		AITA for being upset that my best friend is hanging out with these girls?	"So, little backstory, I have an ex i dated for a while on and off until I broke it off a couple years ago. My best friend's current boyfriend is friends with my ex (which is how they met). The breakup between my ex and I was pretty drama-free, but ever since the breakup we've hooked up casually on and off. Honestly there are no intense feelings here we just enjoy the sex. Our friends were aware of this.

My ex dating this girl (we'll call her Casey). When they first started talking, my ex and I were still hooking up. At first, I was unaware of Casey but started to back off as I was learning that their relationship was getting serious. They dated for a total of about 5 months until she went through his phone one night and found text messages,sexts, and nudes between us from the first couple months Casey and my ex were dating. I understand how awful this is and should have backed off sooner, but at the time, he made it seem like he was still single. When Casey found the texts, him and I hadn't even spoken in months.

The next morning I get paragraphs of harassment in my instagram dms. Casey's friend dmed me claiming she had all my nudes and was going to release them to the public. A couple days later when I was getting off work, my ex texted me and said he wanted to meet up and talk about everything. I was hesitant, but he said he was in the area ( I work at a mall). So he pulls in the parking lot and I get into his car and we sit there in the parking lot for probably about 40 minutes talking about everything that went down. I told him how terrible I felt about the situation but thought it was best if we continued to not see each other. So after that I get out of his car and walk over to my car and get in. As I start to drive off, a jeep whips around the corner, nearly hitting my car and I have to dodge to miss it. I look into the car, and its none other than CASEY WITH HER MOM AND FRIENDS IN THE BACK SEAT. I panicked and drove off as fast as I could. Apparently after I left they chased down my ex and had a screaming match. I still have no idea how they knew we were there.

Now this is where my best friend comes in. While Casey and my ex were dating, my best friend and Casey became acquainted. According to my best friend, her and Casey were never very close but my best friend's boyfriend had friends that became close to her. A couple weeks after the car incident, my best friend went out to the bar with Casey and her friend that harassed me on instagram. She didn't tell me, but after I found out, I told her that it made me uncomfortable, especially with the encounter I had with them. At first she was defensive but agreed that she probably shouldn't have gone out with them. Fast forward now to a month later, I find out that she went to Casey's birthday party, along with her friends. I realize this situation should be between my ex and I, but am I the asshole for getting upset about this?"	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1jjy2	2019-06-17 05:02:28	SouthernTeacher69	AITA for coaching my students this way?	"I coach Academic Decathlon (google it) and recently we have been working on speeches. I also teach science and other related subjects as a high school teacher. 

There is this one female student that I coach who is a decent speech writer but is not the best public speaker. 

In contrast, I have another student who's been in drama for many years and is a natural speaker. When the first student I mentioned was struggling with expression and hand motions for her speech, he picked up a random pencil and said ""this pencil has more expression than you."" 

Her other teammates also joined in with (what I thought was) constructive criticism, and the first student I mentioned started crying.  

The next day, the girl came in to talk to me privately to let me know that her family dynamics at home caused her a lot of trauma and that what happened with the pencil comment made her feel worse. 

I let the female student take a break from practicing speeches for a while,  but I didn't admonish the male student who made the pencil comment because she is 16 and she has a tough world ahead of her. I remained neutral and didn't comment either way. However, I believe that all criticism is something to be learned from and something that can make us stronger regardless of the content. 

I feel like the real world, outside of high school, and even college, will treat her even worse in some ways, and that I need to prepare her for it.

I am in a long distance relationship for almost 1 year and we meet once every week/two weeks. The thing is that of course, we decided to sleep with each other at one point. (I am 18 he is 19). The story begins when he told me that no one is home, so I could set mysel free from vocal limits. I trusted him (as he could easily tell when someone came home). Well his mother came and she heared us. No big deal.   This all happened a week before I was supposed to meet his friends (mostly male) that lived in the same village. I left and came home, I wanted to return week later to meet them. However, in about 3 days he wrote me that the very friends got to know what happened. His mother told a friend of hers and she was the mother of one of them and you know the chain reaction. Now everybody knows. As I come from religious family and I am not confortable with anyone knowing we sleep together. Well, they made fun of me and I could tell in their eyes that they see me as a whore. Since then, I have been mad at her. The story however continues. As I said we are in a LDR. I spoke to him about my feelings towards her and asked him to speak to her about all of that. I asked him to ask her if she thinks about  apoligizing. Well he spoke to her and she tole him that she understands that it is probablly not easy for me, but she did not really respond to the part where he asked her about apology. Since then I have been to him only once and she completely ignored me, after I left she asked my bf whats the matter with me. 
AITA for being mad and for refusing to visit him?

Edit - sorry for the mistake in the title, it makes my eyes bleed as well
Edit 2 - we sleep together, but in my own flat, he is now the one that travels

c1jhma	2019-06-17 04:54:57	ObsceneOatmeal	AITA for asking customers to switch tables?	"I am a server/bartender at a local restaurant. I’ve worked here since freshman year of high school and have been serving since September- I just recently started bartending. I’ve worked at this place for four years and the owner has given me with an unofficial manager position- i know the codes and he trusts me to make sure staff is on the right track.

I was working my second bartending shift. Usually I work as a waitress all day and can help manage the host. Today i couldn’t, because training. At the end of the night i see a BUNCH of people waiting in the lobby. I talk to the host and she is frazzled- there’s a party of 8 who had a reservation to sit at 7:00. It was 7:15 at that moment. The 8 was pissed.

Our dining room has two types of tables: 6 tops and 4 tops, with one 2 top in the back. For larger parties we need to have multiple tables open to move and put together. We only had 2 tables open- a 4 top and a 6 top. We couldn’t move these two tables together to give space for the reservation because they are across the dining room from each other and we would have to lift and carry the tables together, causing mayhem. We didnt have the room for the party of 8 reservation.

At the 2 seater table was an older couple that had already paid and were drinking coffee. They had been there for a little while, their coffees basically gone, chatting. I had an idea: I’d ask them to move. I walked up and apologized for disturbing them, explained that we had made a seating error and that we had a large reservation of people waiting for a table they should have been guaranteed. I told them that the table they were at is generally used to help us fit big parties. I asked them if they would be ok to move to the 4 top table, saying that they could still drink their coffees and talk as long as they wanted.

They got a lil stiff and said “oh, okay we can leave.” I quickly replied with “are you sure? We can bring refills to the other table.” The lady said “no, it’s fine we were just looking something up.” I apologized, thanked them for their consideration and told them to have a nice night. Then, as im standing at the front desk to tell the host, the man from the table says “excuse me, miss. Never in my life have I ever been smacked around like that, and I very much did not appreciate it.” He turns around and walks away before i can even say anything.

I didn’t think I was being an asshole when I asked them to change tables. I’d rather know if I were being an asshole or not- as you can imagine, seating issues happen A LOT in restaurants and I’d like to know if I did the right thing or if i shouldve just let the reservation wait who-knows-how-long for a table to open up.

c1jeu8	2019-06-17 04:46:09		AITA for telling a guy off in front of his family?	"This happened sometime ago at an airport, but it still bugs me. The weather was pretty shitty and as a result the airport that I was at was at a standstill. Flights were suspended, everything was moving slowly, and pretty much everyone was in an irritated, boggy mood. 

I was about to transfer to another flight, and I saw this British family that was acting incredibly impatient. They were wanting to get in front of the line as quickly as possible because they were about to miss their flight, but I had a good feeling that everyone else was in the same position as them. 

They cut through about 2-3 people before they got to me. They even got into a little argument with the airport attendant over missing their flight. So there's this tall bloke that comes up to me, and it appears that he's the father of his family.  He asked me for my flight time, and asked if he could cut through. I told him, in a firm manner, that everyone else is in the same position as he is, and that cutting through wouldn't change anything. 

He obviously gets very irritated by my response, and tells me that I'm being very rude and inconsiderate about his situation. I then said ""You're not the only one that's suffering, we are all suffering. You don't see anyone complaining or moaning about it publicly do you?""

Now I don't have anything against British people, but I've dealt with numerous instances in the past where I've had several negative experiences and encounters with them. 

Something about this experience made me think about some of the negative experiences I've had with them in the past, and it made me tell the father, sternly, without losing my voice or temper, ""Good lord, stop acting like you're so entitled to everything! You Britishers almost always act like the world revolves around you, and that if nothing goes your way, the entire world will collapse. You're not setting a good example to your children about being patient.""

That evidently stunned him and it made him leave, but moments later, the mother told me to ""stop trying to teach us how to be role models"". I then turned away, without saying anything and left them alone.

c1japp	2019-06-17 04:32:32	cynzoid	AITA for expecting my boyfriend to stay awake with me when our baby is awake in the middle of the night?	"My boyfriend and I have an 8 month old baby boy. Hes fairly easy at night, wakes up every few hours but that's okay, I give him his bottle and he's right back asleep. 

My boyfriend sleeps through all of this. He works full time, usually gets up at 5.30am and gets home between 1.30pm and 4.30pm. Baby goes to bed at 7ish. I have to sway him to sleep because he doesn't fall asleep on his own. 

I usually go to bed at 9 or 10 because I know I'm gonna be up every 3 hours at least. My boyfriend comes to bed at the earliest at 11pm. 

Last night our son wakes up at around midnight and even though he was tired, whenever I put him in his crib and made myself comfortable he wakes up again. After 3 tries of getting him to sleep I was groggy and tired as fuck and not really in the best mood. I wake my boyfriend so that he can help me and not in the nicest way,I admit,  I told him, if I have to stay awake then he has to too. My boyfriend then banished me to the guest bed room because if I wanted to sleep I should just go. I told him with the same angry voice he used for me that hes probably gonna come running with a crying baby asking for help in less than 20 min. 

Our son rarely falls asleep with my boyfriend and even though when it's my turn to sleep in on weekends I have to get up early anyway because the baby is groggy and my boyfriend can't calm him down.

My boyfriend has never regularly helped with night shifts, maybe once every couple of weeks when our baby is being really really fussy he takes him to the couch for a few hours. He works in construction so I know that his job is exhausting but I often feel that he doesn't think that being a SAHM is a full time job too. We've had many fights over this. Other dads work just as much and still help at night time. Often my boyfriend's advice when I wake him to help me is to just put the kid in his crib and go to sleep.  But I always tell him that's stupid because as soon as I am almost asleep our baby starts crying and I'm even more tired than before. 

So: Am I the asshole for expecting help at night, even if it's just to keep me company while I'm up? Or should I just pull myself together and do it on my own?

Edit: when I say 'keep me company' I mean help me get the baby back to sleep. If that means playing with him for 30 minutes than that's part of making the baby tired. I don't need someone to chat with when I'm swaying the baby. I thought that was obvious but I explained it just in case."	Asshole	0	0	117.0	15.0	0.0	0.0
c1jap8	2019-06-17 04:32:29	bbpudu	WIBTA if I started to move my items out of communal space in my apartment two months before I move out?	"Today, one of my roommates texted me a very incoherent message (she was out day drinking) telling me that the landlord was raising rent and requiring two year lease and that she and our other roommate had agreed to these conditions...and signed up their friend to take my room.  We’ve all gotten along this past year so I was completely blindsided by this.  

As a result, I feel pretty uncomfortable, disrespected and want to start preparing for my move. My parents live nearby so I wanted to start bringing things that I don’t use, but the others do, to their house. Would this make me an asshole? I’m worried it will come off as retaliation, instead of steps to make my life easier. 

Context: I’ve lived in this great apartment for almost a year with two other people who knew each other before I moved in (I found out about the apartment via a mutual friend). I wanted to live here another year and never said anything about wanting to leave to either roommate. When I asked why I hadn’t been given a heads up about the change in rent/situation, she said “this is your heads up...”

I wouldn’t have agreed to the two year lease because I want to move out of this city, so everyone would have been okay if I had just been involved in negotiations that directly impact my living situation.  Luckily, a friend of mine is moving in with her boyfriend and she currently shares her apartment with a friend of mine and her dog, so I’ll be okay.

I didn’t help her, knowing she should change how she’s trying to get the shirt and be calm, not frustrated. She looks at me angrily after she doesn’t get the shirt and tells me “Why didn’t you help me?” I stated that “You are perfectly capable of doing it yourself.” She gets pissed at me and tries to get the shirt again, knocking another shirt down. She looks at me and tells me to pick it up. I tell her no, and that she’s the one who knocked it down, so she should pick it up. She says “That doesn’t matter.” She then calls me an asshole (my reason for posting here) and I walk away, her insulting me being highly unnecessary. After a bit I walk back to her and she is still in the same spot, the shirt on the  floor still, and her looking angrily at me. “Thank you for picking it up and helping me” she says sarcastically and I tell her your welcome. She complains about my attitude and forces me to pick up the shirt and put it back. We exchange angry looks and I walk around the store. I text her some things about it and she doesn’t respond. I’m anxious and angry and I eventually run into her. (I have a disassociation disorder and two of us we’re co-conscious; An aggressive persecutor and an anxious host. I was told this story by said host and she is helping me write this right now. My mother does not know about this.) 
     I try to talk to her about it and she dismisses it aggressively. I later persue it and she calls me a selfish asshole multiple times. For that reason, I’m posting it here to see what the people of Reddit think. So I guess the main question here is: Who’s the asshole, me or my mother? Or are we both shitty people."

So some background: I work in a family landscaping business with my brother, owned by my mother. I am the eldest, consistently better sales and a generally better landscaper than my brother as well. As a result, my mother has put me in charge of field jobs; running my crew, landscape design, and project overview. However, when it comes to my brother, she refuses to put me in a position of official power, still telling me to “do my job” but also stating that we are “equal”. Now, my brother is only a year younger than I am, and refuses to believe I am better than him at anything (sibling rivalry I guess). As a result, every time we have worked, he has cut down everything I’ve done, denounced it, told me that I am wrong, and that he can do my job better than I can, and that I am a “hinderance” to the workplace and job site.  Today was another charade after about 3 in the past two weeks and I had finally had enough, I left the job and told my mother that I was still okay with working for her, but since she would not tell my brother that I was the boss, I would not be on the job with him. This caused an outrage with her as I was “giving her ultimatums” and “only people with troubled minds give ultimatums”. I just told her simply that I could not continue working with a crew that actively worked against what I was saying, and that I simply don’t get paid enough to have petty fights in a professional environment.

"So there’s this girl, Kelly, and I’ve been friends with her for a few months. She likes me and and I know this, and she knows I know. She is really nice and chill and everything, but I don’t find her attractive. To put it blunt: if she were hotter, I’d date her. Long story short I turned her down. I feel like I shouldn’t be obligated to date someone who I don’t find attractive even if think she’s super nice and cool to hang out with because finding your partner attractive is a pretty important part of a relationship. But Idk I guess I could see how this seems pretty shitty and shallow of me.

Now is when things get a little rocky: her friend, Holly, has a really similar personality. She’s chill and I like hanging out with her— just like I do Kelly. Unlike Kelly, I think Holly is *really* attractive. Problem is, Holly isn’t interested in me the same way. Im trying my best to start something up with Holly.

c1j74g	2019-06-17 04:20:53	sb920	AITA for not wanting my baby to be around my mom’s golden retriever?	"My daughter is 8 months old and the most precious thing in the world to me. I’ll protect her at all costs, obviously. This includes preventative matters.

My mom & stepdad have a large, male golden retriever and he is aggressive to some other dogs and animals. I’ve personally seen him try to attack another male dog while on a walk (on leash.)  I could barely hold him back.

Her dog has also been in “fights” with backyard critters, resulting in him being injured and needing stitches on his face.

My mom insists that her dog is not aggressive towards people, and has only been sweet and loving towards humans (as most Goldens are.) She is promising me that her dog has been around children before and never acted aggressive in the slightest. She’s upset that I don’t want my child near her dog.

I don’t want to take any chances because I believe her dog could perceive my baby as inferior and bite her. She wants to babysit my child at her house but I am refusing to agree to leave my child at her home if the dog is there and I can’t supervise closely.

Our differing opinions on my child’s safety while at my mom’s house is causing unresolved tension between us and hurting her feelings. I doubt we’ll ever see eye to eye on this issue.

AITA.. am I being too over-protective? Do I need to trust my mom’s judgement as she is the dog’s owner?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	14.0	13.0	0.0	0.0
c1j6ft	2019-06-17 04:18:30	ClassicGazelle	AITA for not wanting to cut my hair off after I said I would for a charity event?	"**UPDATE:** 

So just so you have more information. It is my startup, the whole business model was my idea, the formulas, recipes, everything for the product was my design. I have a job other than this. It's literally just a fun little thing we do together on the weekends. We don't even have an office or an actual shop, or employment contracts.  I pay the other women to help me make the product and to help with marketing etc. We do pop-up shows and sell at farmers markets. Only three of us would be able to cut our hair to donate it. The other three women don't have hair long enough, or it's color treated. Today one of the women whose hair couldn't be donated sent a text and said she's not going to do it, because she just doesn't see the point. The woman whose idea it was got really mad and said she was not going to do it either then. I decided that this was too much stress for what was supposed to be a fun creative endeavor for myself and that I was going to shut down the business, and gift / donate any of the remaining products. So... in the end I did not cut my hair, and nobody else did either. 

&#x200B;

So a few weeks ago one of the women at our startup had the idea that we would all cut our hair off to donate to a place that makes wigs for children with cancer. Everyone is cutting their hair tomorrow, and we have been planning this for about two months. Our startup is a collection of six women who all have day jobs, and our startup is linked to hair products. I really liked the idea, because our community has been really supportive of us and it would be a nice way to give back. We were all set up to do this, advertised on social media etc. and then my  boyfriend proposed to me last weekend. I have really long black beautiful hair, and since I was little I pictured myself getting married with my hair down and a long white lacy veil pinned to it. I told them I didn't want to cut my hair because we haven't set a date for the wedding, and this has been a dream of mine. They are all super super mad at me. I tried to compromise and said we could do it after the wedding date is set. But they don't want to change the date. I really don't want to cut my hair tomorrow. I know it's super vain, but I've look forward to my wedding day since I was little. Am I the asshole?

c1j64o	2019-06-17 04:17:31		WIBTA if I (16M) refused to drive out of state to go to my great grandma’s funeral to work and just have an easy start to my summer?	"So a couple months ago, my 90+ year old great-grandma passed away, and my mom was really sad about it but my brothers and I had only seen her a couple times when we were younger, and really only felt bad because our mom was sad(they were very close)Her funeral is in a couple weeks, her husband is still alive to support, and most of my family on my moms side is going to be there. However, we would only plan on being there for 1 day and we just had a whole family gathering like a week ago where I saw everyone who would be there, minus my great-grandpa, so that isn’t much of an incentive on it’s own. The other two big issues for me is the drive is 20 hours to get there, 10 for two days, and 20 to get back. Id be driving 40 hours to go to a funeral for 1 day just to support my mom/family, and that doesn’t seem worth it to me from that alone. I understand the value in going to support them and thats where the question of if im the asshole comes in, idk if im in the right thinking I dont have to be there to support them through a 40 hour car ride.
The other big issue for me is work, Ive been scheduled for a couple days that we would be gone, and while I believe I could get these off, it would be my leverage to not go, and would prevent me the headache of finding people to cover/swapping days. Normally my parents would never allow me to skip an event and work gives me that option I also spent a lot of money recently and really want to start saving ASAP for the summer. 
My dad thinks I should quit my job to go, he and everyone understands this is pretty ridiculous(just to show how much he wants me to go) and I am sure id be able to leverage the importance if the job to get out of it(probably who knows how crazy he can get)
So, am I the asshole for not thinking it’s worth it to support my mom/family and trying to leverage my job to get out of it?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1j5qt	2019-06-17 04:16:21	RenoSteez	AITA for wanting to turn off the AC?	"My partner and I live in a 3000sq. ft home with one other roommate. We’ve lived here since Jan. 2019 so we have yet to experience a summer in this house. The home is split level, and each level has its own AC control/unit. We have multiple large windows that can be opened and our home is perched on a hillside, so we do receive a nice draft. My roommate is just recently out of a job, but prior to this my partner made the least money between the three of us. This is the largest home any of us have ever lived in before. We split all utilities and rent evenly between the three of us, monthly. About a month ago where I live it was a cool 70-80F  during the day and went down to about 40-50F during the night.  No humidity, Sierra Mountain air. The heater/AC remained off, windows remained closed. Now recently it’s been about 80-90F during the day and cools down to about 60-70F at night. My partner said she needs to sleep in a very cold environment else she cannot sleep at night. I’ve been trying to explain to her that if she opened all the windows prior to just before going to bed that it will cool down the room, and that if you run a fan it will be close to the temp outside, which is still fairly cool. I don’t think it’s fair to run the AC this early in the season because it gets to be over 100F  here and it will not cool down as much at night, so I think that’s when we should run the AC. Why run it at 70F when that’s what it is outside and make my roommate and I pay for a third of the bill when we don’t need it? It’s created a fight the last week, and so I just gave in and turned it on. But today it was overcast and rainy, so tonight has been a very cool evening, and a low of 60F so I went to turn off the AC and open all the windows and she got upset,  so again, here we are, AC on. AITA for not wanting to turn on the AC?


Update*- Fight turned into me just opening up the bill and showing our “projected cost” which was 3x what we pay now. Our daily usage went up from $2-$5 to $12. I tried explaining this to her but I guess she just needed to see it straight from the bill. She got even more upset that I was right about the cost."	Not the A-hole	0	0	40.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

My friend (18F) i'm gonna refer to her as A, told me recently a story of her childhood. Her mother and father work long hours that is why sometimes it was impossible for them to pick them up at school. So, she and her brother (they were 8 at the time) returned home with their neighbours, aged 13M and 16F (they attended the same school, school finish at 2). One particular day, A's parents worked until 4. Therefore A and her brother stayed with their neighbours, there they ate and passed time until their parents arrived. They were watching TV waiting. Then it happened, the kid (13M) starts touching her and rubbing his d*** Ingo her legs. This last less than a minute when she decides to leave with the kid's sister, she was not with them. She didn't say a word after that. I believe it only happened once, she didnt tell me. Her parents nor her brother know a thing. She said that does not defind her and she has passed it, I support her, but I cannot stand the idea of his impunity. I want to look for the guy and just letting him know He is a cunt, piece of shit.

c1j2vn	2019-06-17 04:07:30	Juggletrain	AITA for killing a friends player character in Dnd?	"This one is admittedly not the norm for this sub, but I am feeling a bit guilty about it.

A few things before we start, for those that dont know, DnD is a roleplaying dice based game. Like a videogame if you and your friends create and interact with the world and its all in your heads.

I was playing a paladin (Holy warrior) who is gregarious and belligerent and one of my friends a cleric (healing based Holy warrior) who is sneaky literally marked as evil. We have had arguments both in and out of character because of different play methods and character choices before. We definitely had problems with each other's characters, and each other. For reference, my character was the one to hire out an entire brothel while hers was the one that shanked a madame after failing to intimidate her.

We also have three other players who dont matter in this story.

We were facing a mindflayer, a mind controlling enemy with the rest of our party. It targets me because my character is big, dumb and in the front. It controls me and I fail the save, so I pretty much have to do what it says now. Most Dungeon masters would take the character and use it until control ends, but mine gives us more leeway and trusts us to play it right.

Here's the part where I may be the asshole. I did not like my friends character, so when the monster orders me to kill my teammates, I go for the closest one, her. I roll high, and use my highest spell slots and end up killing her character outright. I did not like the character, and figured this was as good a chance as any to get rid of it because thats what I was ordered to do.

And what may put me as even more as an asshole, the spell i used to kill her was my last spell of that kind, I used my last spell that could have revived her to kill her instead, mainly so she would stay dead.

The DM definitely thought it was overkill, and she was a bit pissed too. 

My defense is that my character was mind controlled and ordered to do it and she was the closest ""enemy"" to me so I did my best to fulfill the mindflayers orders. But I definitely went harder than I could have.

Edit: her character was the only one my character could reach easily, we were melee characters and the other 3 were ranged. I would have had to deliberately go around her character in order to hit the others.

Edit 2: DM was not pissed, just uncomfortable. Other 3 players could not care less, they saw it as murderhobo vs bar brawling bank robber (me).

Edit 3: If it matters, her character was the only murder hobo/serial killer of our group. The methods we disagreed upon were primarily whether we should be bombing the town and murdering people (her method), or just fucking prostitutes and scamming generals (my view)."

c1j2vk	2019-06-17 04:07:30		AITA for taking my sister’s birthday money?	"So a couple months ago, my sister was using her friends car and she crashed it. She didn’t hit another car (thank god), but apparently she wasn’t paying attention as she backed out and ended badly damaging the back bumper. She panics and tells her friend who is rightfully pissed and then takes it to a body shop to get it looked at. The mechanic tells her it is $1600 to fix. 

I then get a call from her and she’s absolutely distraught and in tears. She’s a second year college student, so $1600 isn’t something she has lying around for her to use. So I decide to transfer her the money and tell her we’ll figure out how she’d pay me back. I told her we’d keep my mom out of it because my mom would kill her and the stress of the situation would kill my mom. 

The thing is I barely graduated last year and I’m currently working my first job and living on my own. I make a decent living, but I’m still struggling a bit, I got my own bills to pay, student loans to pay off, my car, etc. I’m very careful financially and I did have emergency funds but the $1600 did set me back a bit. 

So she gets the money and she gets the car fixed. That’s all the mattered for now. In terms of the money I told her not to worry about it, we’ll figure it out eventually. 

Well a couple days ago, it was her birthday. So all our relatives gave her money. In total she received $800. So I suggested she pay me back with that money, since she didn’t really need to work for any of it. Hearing this she’s rather pissed and tells me she’s studying abroad in Europe for a year and needs as much money as she can get. 

Feeling bad, I make her compromise that she gives me the $800 and she won’t have to pay me back anything else. Out the $1600 I gave her, she only needs to pay me back $800. I was planning on giving her money for her study abroad before the whole car situation, so I figured this was a fair trade off .

c1j2o7	2019-06-17 04:06:51		AITA for wanting to be by myself(19f) on a family vacation?	"My family is on vacation in my mom's country. We've got her parents, her brother+his wife/daughter, my parents, my sisters, and me. We've got 4 hotel rooms so it's a little spread out. But the room my sister(15) and I are in connects to the one my parents and other sister(3) are in. We're all pretty jet-lagged and go to sleep around 9 to wake up at 6. My whole family likes to be up and get breakfast by 7..I try to sleep in later. They're loud and wake me up, leaving the joining door open all the time.

It's like a thing back home that I'm always in my room with the door closed either reading, homework, netflix, etc. I don't have my own space besides my room and I need it. So, if I want to close the joining door here they just make fun of me:""oh you close the door all the time at home. Let’s all hang out!""

Yesterday was Father's Day and to make my dad happy, I agreed to go down to the beach with them. It was rainy the whole time and even thundered but ""it’s far away"" so my family didn't really care. I didn't go into the water because of *lady problems* so I just sat on a covered beach chair reading my book. Eventually it rained harder and I was getting wet from the wind+rain & people were behind me smoking so I was pretty miserable. I was going to just go back to the room but I was watching our stuff and I didn't want to ruin my dad's fun by asking my mom to come replace me. So I sat it out. We got back to the room with plans to do other stuff I was more interested in but everyone just slept for 3 hours. Fine, I read my book.

Time for dinner, I'd kind of lost my appetite (can't really say why, I'm still confused. It was good food.) and didn't eat much. This morning my mom asked me if I was okay since last night I looked off. I just said I didn't really have much fun and maybe I'm stressed about my summer classes or not seeing my friends for the past week and for the next 2 weeks or that there's nothing really for me to do here. She said it's part of adult-life to grow up and adapt to surroundings. I can't play the ""stressed"" card like I could during the school year in HS or college.

I said I was trying to adapt by not complaining about being miserable on the beach, sweating in the humidity and also becoming wet from the rain. I didn't complain when plans changed and just sat by myself reading. She said I should learn to make adult sacrifices and spend more time with the family and I should speak when I'm unhappy. It's not like I'm actively avoiding them. They're just so excited to do these outdoor activities and I'm not. I'm not an outdoors person but I went for my dad yesterday.

Well, to me, if I spoke out then they'd blame me for ruining the fun. Not speaking out is my sacrifice and I don't know what else to do. I left near tears from that breakfast convo and have been up in my room reading since then.
