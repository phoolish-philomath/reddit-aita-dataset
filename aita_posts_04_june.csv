bwya4x	2019-06-05 03:59:52	AFuckingTrainwreck	AITA for wanting to let my ex-boss find it himself?	" 

Throwaway acct. for obvious reasons.

Was  recently, up until Monday afternoon, employed at a small phone repair  shop as their eBay manager/salesman. My responsibilities included  repairing items brought in as recycling, taking photos of them, selling  them on eBay, and dealing with shipping for these items. Recently, my  ex-boss decided he wasn't making any money off eBay (and was maybe upset  that people on eBay seem to love complaining about anything, even if it  isn't the seller's fault), and decided to let me go. We parted  decidedly less than amicably, he didn't even do me the courtesy of  telling me himself, instead choosing to have the receptionist inform me  despite having ample opportunity to do so himself that very day. Tuesday  afternoon, he wants to find one of the items that was for sale. He has  the receptionist text me to find out. Because I wasn't happy, I decided  that he would have to find it on his own. It was neatly packed in a box  with a label affixed to it that described the contents, so I figured he  wouldn't have any trouble finding it, and didn't feel too bad about  making him waste a little of his time as a ""thanks"" for what I saw as  him being rude.

She instantly told me (w/o him knowing) to see if I'd be willing to talk to him. He's a bit self centered, but he is really funny and cute so I said I wouldn't promise anything would develop bc I'm not looking for anything at the moment but I'd be down to give texting him a chance. He instantly begins expecting me to put in all the effort to talk and begins to complain to our mutual friend about how ""nothing ever goes good for him,"" ""he knew this would happen,"" and ""this is why I gave up on relationships"" if I take longer than a hour to respond, regardless of how short and bland his texts are or if I legitimately am busy. After a while he tells our friend that it's done, he's over texting me. Not even a full day after that, he starts texting me again so I decided to just send him uninterested texts and short answers until he gets the hints. At this point, my friend and I are completely over this situation. The only thing is that we feel guilty cutting him off bc of a bad romantic experience he's had before that he told my friend about (he basically asked this girl out in public and got rejected bc she had already told him no in private) , but at the same time this is just not the right time for a relationship in my life and its causing a lot of necessary stress and anxiety for me bc I feel like I'm expected to reciprocate how he is feeling/acting. I've already drafted a message to him explaining that I'm not interested but I cant bring myself to actually send it to him. After tomorrow I will most likely never see him again and my friend is not close to him at all, would it make me the asshole if I just ghosted/blocked him?"		1	0

"I’m working at the same company as one of my good buddies this summer and he doesn’t have a car so I’ve been driving him to/from work. He lives less than a mile from me, but work is still a decent commute and I’ve been using a lot of gas. This morning, I asked if he could chip in for gas and he said no since I’m “not using any more gas than I would if I weren’t driving him.” So I told him that until he chips in for gas he can Uber to work like he used to before I started there. 

Although he’s right about not causing me to use more gas than I normally would, I don’t think it’s fair for me to incur the entire cost of our commute.

bwy88f	2019-06-05 03:53:49	notsureiffriend	AITA for exploding at my friend who admitted to knowingly sleeping with a married man?	"I've been friends with one of my best girlfriends (in her late 30's) for years and she's had a troubled love life. Without getting into specifics, she isn't in the best relationship right now and her life is riddled with anxiety and depression problems. I've always supported her through this, and have done my best to be a good friend. I think she'd benefit from being in a relationship with someone better than who she's dating, but she is attached. This relationship causes her to make bad decisions at times, and I've always done my best to be the voice of reason and support her when he isn't treating her well. She's contemplated sleeping with an old acquaintance who was in a hapless marriage in the past and I've told her that if she did I would never speak to her again. I've been cheated on, and I told her willingly making that decision makes her a bad person who I wouldn't want to associate with.

So earlier today she regaled a story to me about a guy she had been fooling around with on occasion  and how she met this guy's family, took photos for them, and socialized with his wife at a party. The story made me sick to my stomach and I exploded at her. I told her how awful it is to do something like that to his wife. I also told her to grow up. How I can't trust her with my own partner, and how I cannot be friends with someone who is a bad person like that. I realize my reaction was over the top, as I was yelling, but my reasoning, I feel is justified. She shouldn't have done it, being someone who was once married herself.

I'm not someone who would want to take part in cheating, and I don't really know what was going through her head to bring her to do that sort of thing, especially when she has a real relationship with someone else (albeit not the strongest or best, but it's mostly steady).

Tonight my two friends and I have a football game and both are asking to be driven.

My second friend does not have his licence, my parents and I always drive him to football games whenever he asks for a lift. He however, cannot be driven by his parents in this instance and is saying I should drive him because he has to pay for an uber up and back.

So my friend had to do an exam in a fairly important subject in our carreer and he sent a picture of the exam so that I could solve it and send him the answers.

So I had no intentions of doing anything good for my classmate since he didn't show interest in the course and he is someone who relies on other classmates to pass.

When he sent me the picture of the exam I solved the exercises in a way that looked correct but I made some intentional changes to make it incorrect.

He still thinks the answers are correct and I must admit I found the situation somewhat funny.

bwy6ry	2019-06-05 03:49:07	MythicalBeast45	WIBTA if I don't go to my friend's wedding reception?	"So, I know this is a pretty minor/silly thing to be worried about, but I'm kind of curious what people's thoughts are.  (Please read the edit at the end of the post before commenting.)

&#x200B;

One of my friends from high school got married a year or two ago (I think?  The exact date is a little fuzzy).  She and her husband weren't in a great place financially at the time, so they decided to just have a courthouse wedding and do the reception at some point in the future.  It's probably worth noting that she and I haven't been in touch much over the past few years.  We were sort of close in HS, but I moved out of the state after finishing college and we drifted away (as friends from HS tend to do, I feel).

&#x200B;

Fast forward to sometime last week, when she texts me and asks if I'm coming to the ***reception on June 29th***.  I'm very surprised, because I figured she would have given me a bit more notice, but whatever - I told her I would try to make it happen.  I look at flights from Seattle (where I currently live) to Denver and back, and it's about $400-500 depending on the airline (Southwest has a ""gotta get away"" option for like $100-200, where those are non-refundable).  No big deal.

&#x200B;

However, the more I think about it, the more I feel like this might be a bit much for a short weekend trip, even given the occasion.  I just flew out to Minnesota to visit some friends for their college graduation, and that was about $500 not counting meals and shit.  Plus, there are a couple concerts in the Seattle area (or within reasonable driving range) that I want to go to later this year, which could total around $350.  All of this is definitely affordable on my current salary... it would just be a little tight.

&#x200B;

On the one hand, I know my friend's wedding reception is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of event, and there will always be opportunities to go see these artists in the future.

On the other hand, the reception will probably be pretty awkward for me - I'm very introverted (particularly around strangers), and not counting my friend + her husband, I will know at most 2-3 other people there.  Plus, I'm still relatively new to Seattle  (I moved here mid-March), so I'm trying to explore the surrounding area instead of just chilling out at home all summer/fall.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I decide not to fly out for the reception?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Since a couple people have brought up the fact that this was a very short notice invite, I want to point out a few things.  (Most notably the date, which I've added above.)

* I think she meant to send me an invite earlier and then forgot, because when I expressed surprise, her response was ""I thought we talked about it last time I saw you I didn't mean to be so late notice"".
* It might be a bit of a tacky move on her part, but I still have at least a week or two to get tickets before the prices get crazy.  If she had asked me about coming this weekend, I would definitely be annoyed."	No A-holes here	0	0
bwy6hz	2019-06-05 03:48:12		AITA for having sex with my best friend, who is currently in a relationship?	"These past few months, I’ve (F20) been fooling around with my best friend (M20). It started out as a casual conversation that turned pretty sexual, and since then we’ve sent pictures to each other, sexted, and have had sex with each other a couple times, even losing our virginities to each other. Since I’ve known him since we were younger, we’ve always been very open to each other, however the topic of sex was never really something we brought up til then.

To be clear, he clearly stated he wanted to have sex with me because he trusted me the most to have done it for the first time. At first, I was hesitant for two reasons: the fact that he has a girlfriend whom he’s been together with for a few years, and the fact that he had told me back in the beginning that he didn’t want to go all the way with me. But after talking to him more about it and making sure it was okay, we both decided to do it one weekend,

He‘s told me he doesn’t regret it, but sometimes I wonder if I’m an asshole or if I was simply too needy. I‘ve had some feelings for him back in the past, and sometimes I’m worried that I might return back to that feeling of attachment as well. Like I mentioned before, he’s my best friend, and the last thing I want to do is make him feel regretful or hurt, or even potentially affect his relationship and our friendship in any way."		1	0

You can look through this post history and see what I’ve written about this kid. So basically administration was handling it but I lost it and cussed him out in front of 20+ people. I don’t care I owned up to it, I’m proud of it even. Everyone kept telling me to drop it because I’m graduating and that karma will catch up with him. Fuck that I want to be the FIST OF JUSTICE and I was. This has consumed my life greatly and so yes I do talk about it a lot. I get it and so I was telling my parents and we don’t have a stellar relationship but they were trying to help. My brother who is 22 and still lives at home keeps saying OKAY WE GET IT CAN YOU STOP NOW. He just keeps telling me to get over it. I don’t think he has a fucking right to tell me to get over it as it my own personal issue and I’m taking it at my pace. I literally drove around with friends and had the best day in forever. I feel good after telling this cunt off. I asked my friends after graduation we don’t mention his name unless it’s a serious concern promise ? And they were like yeah ugh fuck him and what he did to us though. I was complaining and yes I was going in circles. I moved on and I was telling my mom about my friend for finishing his program and how I was proud and my brother who was in the middle of showing his shitty vlogs was like can you step out of the room right now so can show them this video and I just glared at him and he said HEY DUMB DUMB IM talking to you and so I turned back to my mom and he threw his bowl of cold but spicy ramen in my face and it burned my eyes and I tried to swing at him ( lol I’m below five feet) and he put me in a headlock. My dad and me ( after I rushed to the sink) were furious but my mom was like please no please No but she was mad too and saying WHAT IS WRONG with you especially since I was sitting right there and this fool was like it’s her fault ( me) and he was fed up with me complaining about my problems. Lol so healthily communicating rather than me arguing with them is suddenly bad ?? Then he was like thanks for fucking up my family blah blah LOL DID I GRAB YOUR HAND TO THROW soup in my face ??

I swear if I’m wrong right now you guys can tell me Bc he was adamant about me being the asshole."		1	0

Prior she was living in China.  My wife and I have been married for 3 years now and now has a permanent green card for the US.  My step-daughter is about to start graduate school here in the US.  I have often tried to discuss the politics of China with my wife but she has no interest.  Today, I asked about what my step-daughter has learned about Tianamen Square massacre out of curriousity from school in China.  She knew nothing.  As I tried to explain what happened, my wife became agitated.  So I dropped the subject.  I feel that it is important to know all history, good or bad regarding any country.  I pointed out that the US has also some bad history but we are free to talk about it in hopes we don't repeat our history.  My wife thinks I should not bring up these topics, but I strongly disagree.

bwy2lv	2019-06-05 03:35:34		AITA for being upset my Mother is going away close to my due date.	"Sorry if formatting is bad I am using a mobile phone.

I’m 38 weeks pregnant. I’ve recently moved back to my home town after living abroad to be close to my family with my second child on the way. My first child was born 12 days early.

So my mother is going away this weekend for 3 days to visit friends, where she is going is a 4 hour drive from where we live. The plan was for her to be in the delivery room with me and my partner for the birth. She was there for the first child’s birth, was there for my niece and nephews birth. And was upset when my brother and his partner excluded her from the birth of their second born. 

AITA for being upset/angry that she is choosing to go away so close to my due date? She only decided to make this trip two weeks ago, so it’s not like a preplanned trip. She is staying with friends so there’s no accomodation that’s been booked and payed for."		1	0
bwy1ru	2019-06-05 03:33:05	daniska_project	AITA for not fixing my girlfriend's sister's phone	"Let me just start by saying, I'm really handy and I know how to tinker and fix things. I've fixed phones before for people and when you have the tools and a steady hand, it's really not too difficult. The mall kiosks charge around $100 to fix a cracked screen, however, I can buy the part and install it myself for about $15. I [21M] have fixed my gf's [21F] phone screen before, and I've fixed her little sister's [15F] phone screen before too. 

Her sister is a major brat and can be rude and hurtful towards me. Not always directly, but through the things she says to my girlfriend. An example is when my gf was asking her sister a question in the sister's room and I poked my head in the doorway to see if they were done. I was later told that her sister started fussing at my gf about me doing that and that I am not allowed to come into her room ever again. I try to do nice things for her sister, such as, fixing her phone screen, buying her food, and driving her places. Lately she's been even worse than usual. She blamed me for getting her sick after I bought her McDonald's and also I drove 20 mins to her friends house to pick her up from a pool party at an agreed upon time and she just says ""come back in 2 hours"". She begs her sister and family for things and they usually give in. I think she's extreme spoiled and expects things to be done for her. 

Anyway, so her iPhone has been dying at progressively lower percentages over the past few weeks until recently, it completely died. Everyone knows the older iPhones have notorious batteries and I had suggested we replace it when I did the screen, but she said no. So now, she has a dead iPhone that needs a new battery, my gf wants me to fix it to avoid paying someone a lot to do it, but I'm like, ""she's mean to me, I'm not gonna do her any favors until she starts acting right towards me"". My gf has agreed in the past that her sister is a ungrateful brat who is mean to others, but because they are siblings, she's on her side. My gf tells me that it's not my role to teach her sister a lesson. She keeps telling me to fix it or I'm an asshole. She says that maybe if I fix it, then her sister will be nice to me. I personally believe in action speaks louder than words, so she can start being nice to me, or I'm not doing it. 

I've talked to my parents, co-workers, friends, and my own siblings about it and every single person told me that I shouldn't fix it for her. So what do y'all think, AITA?

bwxzar	2019-06-05 03:25:15	choatec	AITA For not going to my GF's planned kayak trip for a BJJ tournamwnt?	"Background for context: 

My GF (23F) and I (26M) have been dating for around 7 years. A little over a year and a half ago she took a job 3 hours away and we have been dating long distance since. The distance has been stressful but recently I have been picking up hours at work and have not been able to see her as much. This has put even more stress on us. 

She really dislikes the city I live in and has been trying to get me to move up to where she lives. I said I would come up May but have now pushed it back. I am serious about moving up in July. She is now saying she is done coming out to see me due to how ""shitty of a town and house I live in"" (the house and city aren't the best). Due to her refusal to come see me I told her I won't come out to see her until she visits me. This is all very recent and I don't truly know if she is refusing to see me but she did have an opportunity to come over about 2 and a half weeks ago and she made plans with her brother instead.

As a side note I have been training jui jitsu for around 7 months, I really enjoy it and have been wanting to compete.

Conflict:
Around the time she went out with her brother she made plans for this weekend, for me to come out and go kayaking on Saturday at her place. We usually take turns going to each other's house and it's her turn to come to mine but I said whatever and planned to come out. 

Fast forward to after a jui jitsu practice the coach announced that there was a tournament coming up this weekend nearby. There is another tournament in August but by then I'd be up living at her place and in a different gym presumably.  In general I really wanted to compete and didn't want to wait when I had an opportunity in front of me. So I booked the tournament and still planned to see my GF thur-sun but would have to leave Saturday morning and be back to her house on Saturday night. 

My GF, to say the least, was extremely pissed off about this. Told me how disrespectful i am and how embarrassing it will be to tell her friends that I picked this over kayaking. She told me I can either cancel the tournament or break up. I told her I wasn't going to cancel the tournament, that I know I'm being rude but this means a lot to me and I'm going. So she said we're broken up and hung up on me .

bwxyhq	2019-06-05 03:22:48	aitathrowaway7865	AITA for voicing my opinion about my sister pawning off her dogs on our parents?	"My sister is in her late 20s, and has a lot of untreated mental/emotional problems. Seven or eight years ago she decided that she was going to get a dog to help her cope with them. Our dad paid ~$300 for the dog, which was purchased from a breeder because my sister wanted a specific breed. She kept the dog for ~2-3 months then ""gave"" it to our parents - she asked them to watch the dog for a few weeks because she was ""tired from taking care of it and needed a break"". She left the dog at their house for a couple of months, then told them ""He loves you so much, he's attached to you, you should keep him!"" and my dad agreed to keep the dog.    

About a year after that happened, she told our dad she wanted another dog. He bought her another one from a breeder. My sister kept the dog for a few months, and then ""gave"" that one to my parents as well, the same way she did with the first dog.      


Around a year ago, she decided that she wanted a dog again. Our dad took her to the shelter and paid the adoption fee for the dog she picked out. She kept it for a while, then did the ""can you watch him for a while"" thing again. This time, though, our dad told her that they weren't going to do it. My sister got extremely angry and returned the dog to the shelter.    


Last month, my parents, my sister, and I were having dinner together. My sister and mother were in the living room after dinner, and my sister was showing our mom something on her phone and saying ""I love him so much. He's so cute. You know he's cute!"" Mom said to me ""Your sister wants another dog."" I said ""I guess you and dad have to ask yourselves if you're ready to have another dog."" My sister kind of bristled and said ""What do you mean by that?"" I said ""Every time you get a dog, you end up giving it to mom and dad instead of taking care of it yourself, and I think that's a factor that needs to be taken into consideration if dad is planning to buy you another dog."" She got very angry with me, called me an asshole, and left the house. 

My mother and father told me that what I said was ""hurtful and uncalled for"" and said that my sister ""needs something to help her feel better."" I kind of got upset at that point and told them ""Then she needs to get into therapy and start working on herself instead of trying to fix things by getting dogs because she's sad and then pawning them off on you guys when she gets bored with them."" (My sister was not there to hear me say that, and I'm not sure if either of my parents told her I said it.) I pointed out that my dad is now fully responsible for two dogs that were both purchased with the intention of my sister keeping and caring for them. 

I left at that point, because my parents were pretty unhappy with me. My sister is no longer speaking to me, and my mom has called a couple of times asking me to apologize for what I said, because it's ""having a negative emotional impact"" on my sister.

bwxx8t	2019-06-05 03:19:03		AITA for not loving my brother?	"Exposition on my brother (19M)... My brother and I have different dads. His dad is complete heroin addict, piece of shit, and I hope he rots. He developed ADHD and Bipolar. He's angry all the time and manipulative. He makes bad decisions CONSTANTLY. Most recently, my parents asked him to sell this Cadillac my dad and I spent 2 months fixing and somehow in one afternoon he trashed the engine. Now, we have to sell it for scrap medal. 

HOWEVER, he did watch his girlfriend die in front of him, and had an abusive dad, and has tried to repair his relationship with me by buying me nice stuff. He's never been 

Exposition on myself (14F)... I, unfortunately, didn't get to have a childhood because of him. My parents had to focus so much on him that they didn't have too much time for me and my problems. I had to be a perfect child, which (because God loves irony) caused me to develop bipolar disorder. 

Now, for the actual problem.

&#x200B;

I don't love or have any hope my brother, and I feel weirdly proud of myself for it. My entire life, all he's done is (though inadvertently) caused me pain. I feel as though I'm defending myself.

* Because of his actions when he lived with us, my parents treat me like a criminal because they're afraid I'll end up like him, even though I bust my ass getting A's and saying ""ma'am/sir."" 
* Because of his mental state, my parents hate taking me to my (doctor-encouraged) treatment because they blame psychology for my brother being a fuck up. 
* He constantly gets my hopes up that he's gonna go to college, gonna get a job, gonna be a good person, gonna be the older brother I've needed my whole life. You know what happens every time? I'm let down. 
* Without him and the trauma he caused me, I maybe could've been a mentally healthy person. I could be rehashing teenage-girl-drama with a good sibling, as opposed to turning to strangers on the internet for judgement. 

Let me make this clear: he doesn't know I feel this way and I'm not cutting him out of my completely. I kinda poke fun at him, avoid his phone calls, and won't hesitate to call him out on his BS. I'm not mean, but I don't coddle him like my mom does. It's not like I'm doing anything worse than what he did! I'm gonna visit him to go to this theme park. But, that's truthfully because I like the theme park and his *occasional* okay moments. I mean he's only used my parents when it benefits him, so why can't I only use him when it benefits me? 

&#x200B;

I know he cares about me, but I just cannot mentally care about him anymore. I don't want to.

bwxwog	2019-06-05 03:17:19	BestFriendThrowOut	AITA for trying to phase my best friend of 15+ out of my life?	"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have a childhood best friend of over 15 years. We met when I started at a new school in 2003 (we were 9 and 10, I believe. We are now 25 and 26) and ever since then we’ve been inseparable. We did everything together growing up, and still stayed strong when we went down different paths after we graduated high school. This girl was like my sister. She was my rock. 

However, recently (the last year or so) I’m finding it hard to be around her or talk to her. She was with a guy who treated her like garbage and I was 100% there for her through all of it. Then she got pregnant and has a baby who is now a year old. The baby daddy is no longer in the picture. My friend lives with with her single mother who supports her and her child. She has been unemployed for well over a year, despite being a Certified Nurses Aid. She refuses to get a job, and comes up with multiple excuses when people tell her that she should start looking. Her mother does everything for her, and when she doesn’t get her way, she acts like a child and gives everyone the silent treatment until they cave. I’ve babysat her child, given her gas money and transported her when he car was unable to drive. I’ve done a lot for her, but I just feel like she’s stopped maturing, and I’m continuing to grow. Due to my job, I had to move 3 hours away from my hometown. She would get really upset when I wouldn’t come back to town when she wanted to see me and she always makes me feel guilty. So, as of late, I’ve been screening her calls and dodging her text messages to try and phase her out of my life. I’m also getting married soon and I’ve told her that I do not have a date picked. But I do. It’s happening very soon. But I have no plans to invite her. I just feel that if I remain in this friendship, I will be unable to grow as a person. I guess, lately, I’ve been able to see that she’s a really toxic and negative person. I have a wonderful job, fiancé and I’m building a life for myself I never thought I’d have. But if I remain friends with her, I will be dragged back down. I’ve tried talking to her about this, but she just makes me feel extremely guilty for having these feelings. So, I’ve decided to start phasing her out of my life. She calls me everyday, and I don’t answer. AITA for just throwing away a friendship?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwxwn3	2019-06-05 03:17:10	listeningwind42	AITA for being loud and obnoxious at bar trivia	"So right off the bat I feel like I could have handled this better, but I want to know if my drunken ass stumbled into asshole territory or if I straddled the line. I frequent bar trivia with a regular team that wins or places very often (so we certainly get some ire) at a place near me with bar dollar rewards every Tuesday. This week, we had a question that asked: ""Spruce knob is the highest point and the Potomac river is the lowest point of what state?"" 


My team wasnt sure at first (definitely did not know the highest point), but we reasoned out that Virginia has a coast, Maryland has a coast, and in the off chance the Potomac touches Pennsylvania, its border with the Delaware should disqualify, so we said West Virginia. When the Quizmaster graded the round, he said ""if you put Virginia, I figure you're close enough, so you'll get credit.""

Now, I'm typically pretty ok with leeway at trivia if the question is rough (eg is Layla by Eric Clapton or Derek and the Dominos) or no one else gets the answer right. But I was pretty damned peeved by other folk getting credit by this question, especially when a neighboring group who we knew were close point wise and broke into cheering at the news their (incorrect) answer would still get them points. When they started celebrating I yelled ""Thats fucking bullshit! Virginia has a coast! They shouldn't get any fucking credit."" Friends, when I say yell, I mean YELL. I belted that shit.

Nothing more would have come of it if until we somehow managed to tie them in the end. When representatives of our teams went up to resolve the issue, they were tied with us. The quiz-master was very haphazard because he had lost or failed to bring some of the key components, so he asked us how he thought we should resolve the tie as opposed to being formal. I responded, well, I don't mean to be a dick, but didn't you guys say Virginia for the Potomac question"" (I only knew this because they were screaming when he gave them credit) ""We got it right, I mean, Virginia has a coast so it cant be correct. So we should get it.""

Quiz master was said ""I mean, rivers flow into the ocean, soo..."" He didn't even consider the other half of the question, but I said ""the Potomac flows into the Chesapeake, not the ocean. Sometimes its just WRONG.""

The other team said ""fine, give it to them."" I thought they were being very honorable and respectful, but then when they started to leave one of them said ""it sounds like they need it more."" They then went back making fun of me all the way to the table. I didn't hear much of the specifics myself, but one of my friends was close to going up and slapping one of them (they did not confront them at all ultimately), and I heard enough to know they were mocking me.

I guess I know they were being dicks after the fact, but AITA how I handled it up to that point? I'll be honest with you all, I know I was abrasive but I don't think I did anything wrong. Appreciate your judgement.

EDIT--thanks guys, I appreciate it. it sounds like I fucked up in my composure. I wish I could apologize to the other team., but they seemed like a one off group from the get-go. Thanks. I will try to be better."	Asshole	0	0

bwxtt5	2019-06-05 03:08:25		AITA for refusing to pay full utility bill	"For the past two years at college, I have lived with a roommate. About a year ago, his indoor cat somehow developed fleas. I asked him for months to take care of the problem but nothing was ever done. He finally moved out in May, and I went back to my hometown to visit my family. Both of our names are still on the lease through July 1st. 

A couple of weeks ago, he asked if I would take responsibility for the utilities for June since I would be living there for part of the month and he wouldn't. I agreed, assuming I would be spending at least one to two weeks in the apartment. When I arrived at our apartment this past Saturday, not two minutes into walking into the apartment, there were at least fifteen fleas on my leg. I immediately walked out, took a deep breath, called my mom, then called an exterminator. The exterminator has now sprayed, but the situation was so bad they recommended a second treatment, and did not recommend staying in the apartment until the second treatment has been completed in two weeks. Either way, I am going out of town in a few days and will not be back until June 30th.

I have been staying with friends since Saturday, since I cannot stay in my apartment at all due to fleas. When I informed my roommate that I did not feel I should be responsible for the entirety of the utilities since I can't stay there at all right now, he said I was being unfair since he moved out in May, and had verbally agreed to pay the utilities for June. I don't feel I'm being unreasonable by requesting we split the final month of utilities, but maybe I am being an asshole."	No A-holes here	1	0
bwxstd	2019-06-05 03:05:21	randoaccount77	AITA For Wanting To Go On A Girl’s Trip to the Bahamas?	"I am married and have 2 kids. I’m a SAHM and work part time in the evening (I go to work once my husband gets home). I have a few best friends and I thought of the idea to go on a weekend getaway with them. I asked them if they’d be interested in going next spring/summer so it’d give us all time to save up for the trip. 

I told my husband about the trip idea and he seemed less than thrilled.. I explained that I think it’d be good to get away for a weekend and not have 2 kids up my butt all day. He is normally super supportive of me hanging out with friends/going out/traveling with friends. He was taken aback because he thinks the trip will cost a lot of money. I told him I could save up from my part time job (it doesn’t pay much) and just use that money so we don’t use any of our usual monthly budget. He got upset and said that he doesn’t get to use his money to go off and spend on whatever he wants so why can I do that with my money? 

I’m big on the philosophy of all of our money being “our” money and not his/her money. I just thought it would be ok if I used the little money I do get to save up for the vacation. (We aren’t super tight on money, but we don’t have lots of extra cash either). 

He is right, I don’t usually like him going out and spending lots of money on random things (shoes in his case). It got me thinking that maybe I am overstepping by being so strict with how his paychecks are spent (budgets, etc). Also, I now feel bad that I could spend the money that I’d use on the trip towards our family instead or put the money into our house. I also realize that he doesn’t usually get time to go out with friends/weekend getaways. I know that part is my fault, I get frustrated/overwhelmed being home with the kids all day and I can’t wait until he gets home so that I’m not the only one taking care of the kids. He always claims that he doesn’t do stuff like that because he prefers to stay home with his family, but I know it’s partially because he sees that I’m overwhelmed/frustrated.

Edit to add: what I mean by buying shoes is in the sneaker head type of way. Like he has bought 3 pairs of Nike/Jordan’s/ whatever the latest trend is this year. I don’t mean if he needs new shoes then can’t buy them. I just mean I don’t usually budget for a new $300 sneaker every month. I do like the idea that people mentioned of putting aside free spending money for both of us so we can buy what we would like guilt free.

I also think I was maybe unrealistic with how much a weekend trip to the Bahamas would cost.. I was thinking it would end up being around $1000 with flight, hotel and food."	Asshole	0	0
bwxsrq	2019-06-05 03:05:14	sweeetkiwi	AITA for asking my wife to mow the lawn?	"So this happened last night and is still pretty raw so I will try to explain in as neutral a fashion as possible. TL;DR at bottom.

Recently, my wife and I got sod placed in our front and back yards. Before that it was mainly just weeds and such that took me about 20 minutes to take care of with a standard mower. Now, I find that it's taking me 2+ hours to finish the back and front yards, which doesn't include the time to rake all the dead grass (because our mower is a POS) and edge the lawn. I also want to point out that we do not have a big lawn, approximately 1500 square ft. 

Anyways, we had been on vacation for a week so the yard had not been mowed for some time. I had been mowing the back on my day off, but I quit after it took me an hour and a half to only mow half of it due to the length, thickness and how wet it was, even in the summer heat. My wife came home, saw that the job was only half finished, and made some comment to the effect of ""Oh, you couldn't finish the job? What did you do all day?""

I did not take this well, and stated that if she wanted to have it done then she could do it herself. This is when she tells me that she has never mowed the lawn and she ""isn't going to start now"", and that mowing the lawn is a man's job anyways. She also stated that since I have more days off a week I should have more responsibility around the house

I flipped out. We have a very good relationship, and both of us have worked at various times. We have no kids, but when we married I worked full time while she worked part time, then she managed to find fulltime work while I went back to school. Now we both have full time positions, with me working three 12 hour shifts and her working a more traditional 8-5 M-F. We have always split chores around the house, doing our own laundry and whatnot. I told her that saying that mowing the lawn was man's work was a bullshit excuse, as I could never refuse to cook dinner or do the dishes by saying those were ""women's chores"". I also pointed out that we both work the same amount of hours a week so it's not justified to say that I should do more just because I have more days completely free of work. 

She ended up saying that I was getting out of line and acting like an asshole because she didnt know any other wife whose husband made her mow lawns. I think that I am in no way in the wrong here, but it's been bugging me all day that I might be wrong. So, AITA?

TL;DR: I asked my wife to mow the lawn. She said that's a man's job and I had more free time. I said that's a BS excuse.




Edit: For clarification, 1) we both have been wanting sod for a few years so we wouldn't have the worst looking house in the neighborhood and could actually do things in our backyard. It was no one person's decision. 2) We have an electric push mower that I have been using for 5+ years. Never had an issue, but this new sod is very nice and thick and apparently holds moisture like a camel, which just clumps up the bag opening every 5 feet or so, requiring it to be manually cleared. Very slow going. 3) Our work hours are very similar despite the difference in days. When I work I leave the house by 6 AM and will not get home until 8 PM at the absolute very earliest usually later. She leaves the house at about 8 AM and will leave anywhere from 430-5 PM. Her boss is very cool with her taking several hours off during the day if she needs it or she will leave early if the office is empty. I am very jealous.

That being said, we talked and it seems like getting a lawn service is the best option for this particular circumstance, if we can find one that is affordable.

bwxsm9	2019-06-05 03:04:43		AITA for telling my friend I didn’t want to eat at a certain restaurant for her birthday dinner	"My friend decided to have her birthday party at a restaurant. She made a group chat and added five other people to it (including me). However, she told us all that she didn’t know what restaurant she wanted to and she didn’t care where we went. We started bringing up suggestions on the group and she said she didn’t care and we could choose/vote on it. Other people were bringing up restaurants and we either added them to the list or denied them. Someone asked me where I wanted to go and I said I didn’t care where we ate but if we could please eat somewhere with seafood or vegetation options since I don’t eat meat out, and she agreed.
However, someone brought up going to an all chicken place. This restaurant only sold chicken, and everyone on the group was down to eat. My birthday friend agreed to go there, and I chimed in on the group saying I couldn’t eat anything there. My friend then told me to just order some fries they had as an appetizer and “it’ll be fine.” Some more talking happened and I explained to her that I don’t eat meat out, and I wouldn’t typically care if we all went to a restaurant with meat, but since she told us she didn’t care where to eat and we should choose, it’s unfair for her to choose one without an option for me and one other girl (who also doesn’t eat meat) to eat. She got mad and made a deal about not having her dinner, left the group, and then said she wouldn’t have a dinner. All my other friends were agreeing with her and told me I should suck it up since it’s her birthday. AIMA? I typically would’ve sucked it up and ate just fries since it was her birthday dinner, but since she told us she didn’t care, I felt like it wasn’t fair for her to ask us to choose and then not cater to two of her guests."		1	0

My ex-gf and I spilt about 6 months ago due to irreconcilable differences and have done our best to remain friends as we still live together and are in a band together (we were together when it started). All in all we've been civil and have kept things professional. This past weekend, as a band outing/networking move, I got us tickets to Camp Anarchy, a 3-day punk festival where all our favorite bands were playing. The trip was to be me, our guitarist and her. To save on hotels, we all bunked up in a double bed room sleeping in separate beds of course. The first day things went smoothly. We made the trip to the venue, did a bit of networking, watched the bands and enjoyed ourselves. Totally typical day. Then after the show we were eating at a diner and my ex says, ""how do you feel about new-bf meeting up with us?"" I flipped out and told her how uncomfortable that would be for me considering that I would then have to be sleeping in the same room as her and new-bf, not to mention that this was a band excursion where we were using our spare time to network. We argued about it until 2am; she insisted I was over-reacting, I insisted she was being inconsiderate and we went to bed flustered. When I woke up the next morning at 8am, I looked over to the other bed and her and new-bf were cuddled up, sleeping together. I should mention at this point that we are from Chicago and this festival was near Columbus, OH, meaning that new-bf drove nearly 7 hours through the night to get to our hotel. Which also means that he was already on his way as she was ""asking"" if it was ok that he joined us. At that point I stormed out of the hotel and told her that I wouldn't be hanging around her and new-bf for the rest of the weekend and that me and guitarist were going to get another hotel room. We stayed separate for the remainder of the festival. We have hardly spoken since. AITA for getting so upset?"	Asshole	0	0

I have chronic back pain and floating helps a lot. I started going fairly soon to when they opened, about three years ago. The center has four different themed rooms that you can choose between at the time of booking. Probably the third or fourth time I went there, an older woman who had booked an appointment at the same time as mine started complaining insistently that she wanted MY room. I agreed to swap because while I liked the theming of the room I'd originally picked better, functionally they're all the same so it wasn't really a big deal to me.   


The owner and his partner were grateful that I was easy-going about it, and were extremely generous as a way to make up for my inconvenience. They gave me a free float, a free sauna, and as I was also an early return customer to their business, they added a lifetime pass for 15% off any service I booked to my account. Sweet! And I did, in fact, book the next two or three services online and got 15% off.   


But then at a certain point, the discount pass just...stopped working. I can still see it on my account, with an expiration date of May 2999, but when I book a service, it doesn't apply.   


This center is a pretty small business, and as someone who started going pretty early, I get some perks thrown my way. I got two other free floats (once due to a last-minute cancellation, once when the owner noticed when I came in that I was particularly stressed/anxious), I have upon occasion gotten free upgrades in service, if no one is booked after me they'll let my time run an extra 10-15 minutes for free. Given all the other freebies I've gotten, and given the fact that I feel like I was more than reimbursed for my inconvenience, to ask, ""hey, just wondering what happened to my lifetime discount?"" feels like the epitome of greed and entitlement.   


But on the other hand...this is something that they already gave me, that they assumingly did mean to be a “lifetime” discount, not something additional I’m asking for. It’s likely they aren't even aware it has stopped working on their online portal. I also think I would book more frequently if I was getting 15% off everything, which would be nice for my pain management. 

I'm truly torn on this - WIBTA if I asked what happened to my discount?

She never worked when they were together and she dumped him by leaving a note that she’d be back for her stuff. There’s a lot more reasons but no sense in explaining them all. 5 years down the road fiancé and I first get together we met after his dad was killed in a plane crash and she tried to come out of the woodworks and won’t leave him alone. After a year I put my foot down about him cutting her out completely cuz to me it looks like she’s trying to come back cuz she thinks he’s got money coming his way.  Over time as I deep cleaned the house (I moved in with my fiancé at his house) I found condoms hidden throughout the house (fiancé is not much of a deep cleaner) and they were expired and not the brand my fiancé uses so it confirmed his suspicions she was cheating at the end of their relationship. 
AITA story:
The last two recent deaths we had of people we cared she would call his mom to inform her to tell my fiancé. The first person was a second mom to my fiancé so of course he got called instantly the second one was one of his friends for the last 25 years so of course he got called. The friend she contacted my fiancé’s friends wife to tell them then night before then the next day called his mom to make sure he knew. 
I find this really creepy and weird that someone who dumps him in a harsh way, cheated, and only tried to make a appearance when the chance of a lot of money came about. I feel like a asshole cuz it annoys me that she does this when my fiancé is very private and doesn’t like it when his mom gets into his business cuz she’s over caring (best way to describe it) I asked him if he wanted me to call her about his buddy earlier cuz I had a feeling his ex would do this and he said no but here came a call from his mom asking if he’s alright and him getting irritated. 
AITA for getting annoyed by his ex trying to contact my fiancé’s mom every time someone passes?

Someone responded: some of y’all pretend to care about mental illness and then tweet dumb shit like this and it really shows. 

Since I didn’t think it correlated at all, I direct messaged them, saying, “I didn’t mean to offend you, and I’m sorry if I did.

So I’m a 28 year old guy who lives with three other dudes and we’ve all known one another since grade school. We live in Williamsburg BK. My one pal went out to the bars tonight (a Tuesday) and I’m here sitting on the family couch where I remain, writing this note.

He calls me at 9pm while I’m in my PJ’s waiting on my other roomie to serve dinner, a delicious looking homemade Mac n Chay. He calls me and explains the situation:

“I’ve got these two girls on my line, me and the one are really feeling each other and I need you to come to the bar next door where we are at (literally right next door) to chat up the other so I can have some alone time with this very interested girl.” 

I start making all sorts of excuses like “ahhh but Deon, I’m in my jammies and it’s been a long day! I’m super shot, really didn’t get enough sleep last night and waiting on Luke to serve this handsome looking dish. Not to mention I just smoked some pot and will be completely useless in the charm department.” Now thing you have to understand is that Deon is CROOKED but making some valid point here. He would be there at the drop of a hat for me in a situation like this. The place is literally down the steps from our fifth floor apartment and right next door. It’s finally nice out and we’ve been talking about being able to do more stuff at random times because of the improving weather. He even manages to bring these two girls up to our apartment where they hung out on the roof, but my shot ass stayed in and helped myself to a second helping of mozzarella Asiago heaven.

He’s half passed out laying next to me on the couch mumbling about how I let him down, and I can’t help but feel that I should have sacked up, made an appearance, had a conversation with this other girl, and let Casanova have his moment. AITA for being such a shot bastard?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bwxllb	2019-06-05 02:43:35		AITA for banning my 14yo daughter from all technology that accesses the internet, and telling her she has lost her vacation to visit her grandparents?	"Last year, my wife and I (step mother to my daughter) found out that my, at the time, 13yo daughter was chatting with a person who claimed to be a 14yo girl on Instagram. This person does not live in the same country as we do.

My daughter said that they were ""dating"", myself and her birth mother talked to her about the dangers of this, and we read the messages. Nothing sexual, but VERY emotionally demanding of my daughter to respond to her. Also this other person is outwardly presenting as depressed, anxious, socially outcast etc, and the general attitude was having a very negative impact on our daughter.

We messaged this person and told them not to contact her again, uninstalled Instagram and told her not to do it again. Trusting our daughter we left her phone with her.

A few months later, she was back again chatting with this person. so we took her phone off of her. She has a tablet that she uses for drawing and watching movies, and she assured us that she does not have Instagram on there. Again we trusted her that it was over and let her use the tablet.

A few months later, we found out she was again chatting with this person via a chatroom (I do not remember the name of it) via google chrome, she also connects via hangouts, so she lost her tablet.

Every time she gets busted she is very upset and cries a lot, but offers no explanation of why she was doing it.

Again, the person on the other, end presented as a teenage girl, they talked to each other about being in love and that they were ""supporting"" each other through their tough lives.

My daughter has a great life, we live in a great town and she really does not have any problems with behavior or acting out in any way, but recently, she has been quite grumpy with her 2 sisters, who are both younger, especially the youngest, who is 10.

But this person is really bringing her down in a very negative way.

So last week, we found out that she had searched her mother's room for her tablet and was using it to chat with this person. This had been going on for about a month before we busted her.

She had removed the tablet from the case and hid the tablet in her room.

She now has no access, apart from school, to the internet.

My daughter and myself are due to visit my parents in about 4 weeks, who live in the USA, we have told her that she is not going as punishment because of the lying and deceitful behavior. Which brings me to the part of feeling like an asshole, for being too heavy handed with the punishment."	Asshole	1	0

bwxk65	2019-06-05 02:39:24	normanthedog	WIBTA if I stopped making any effort to talk to my 96 y/o Grandpa again?	"Apologies I'm on mobile.

As the title says, my grandpa is 96 years old. He's the only grandparent I've ever known, everyone else had died by the time I was a baby. Ever since I was born he spent 9-10 months out of the year in another state and would come back for the 2-3 months it was warm where I lived. He never made a large effort to be in my life and would always make sure to arrive just before my cousin's birthday and leave just before mine. I love my grandpa but I would not describe our relationship as close by any capacity.

A few years ago he decided to move back hoping family would take care of him because he's old. Now I should clarify, he isn't short of money and he isn't frail, he honestly doesn't look or act anywhere near his age. He doesn't live in a nursing home (by choice) but don't go into his personal details any further.

The past few years of him living here have been hell. Since I'm the closest family member to him in proximity, he expects me to make him a top priority in my life (I work over 40 hours a week, I'm married, and I own a house). He's called me in the middle of the work day to take him to the hospital multiple times only to go and hit on the nurses and be told he's fine, he can never calls my wife by her correct name when he sees her, every time I see him I get lectured on never doing enough, and he expects me to be the one to initiate anything we do. He's acted similarly towards my parents for years and my mom finally put her foot down and told him to knock it off with me and her (he was acting very similar to her)

It's been about 2 months since I have seen him last after my mom finally said something. It hasn't been because I've been avoiding him, I've just been busy and it hasn't been a priority to contact him. Well today he decided to stop by and started arguing with my dad over something trivial to the point my dad somewhat blew up at him because he was already having a stressful day. They both apologized to each other at the end but it left a really bad taste in my mouth.

I feel like the man is toxic and I really do my best to keep toxic out of my life but at the same time, he's my grandpa, he's old, and I do love him. I've felt bad over the last few months about not making an effort to talk to him and I've been considering inviting him for dinner soon but today just left such a bad taste in my mouth that I don't want to make an effort anymore. If he wanted to see me I'd absolutely be open to it but I don't want to make the effort anymore. WIBTA or should I just suck it up and start trying to involve him in my life again?"

Honestly, I don't think I am but I keep over thinking it so of course, I take it to Reddit. 

So basically I finished my shift because my manager told me to leave early (work was really slow it's a Tuesday) and so I clocked out and waited for my mom to pick me up. My job is a host so I seat people to their tables (I work at a restaurant if you haven't figured that out yet.) Anyway, after my shift I was sitting at one of the tables that's literally always empty and someone walked in. My co-worker and I were the only ones on that shift that did the seating people and all that jazz, so when those people walked in there was no one to seat them. 

I just sat there like a dumbass because I didn't know if I should seat them or not (even though I had already finished my shift.) That couple sat there for like, five minutes waiting to be seated because no one was working that job. 

I feel like an asshole for not seating them but at the same time if my shift ended and I clocked out I'm done with my job so...?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

It’s been a good 6 months and I’ve worked at the same place as him (he didn’t give me the job, we both just applied) and we would always hang out after work and he’d come over. Now I have a new job and he still works at the same place I did before and he still visits. But he almost always asks me every week to go mini golfing with me and I just really don’t want to because every time he asks it’s always at a bad time. Right after work he shows up randomly and says “let’s go mini golfing :D” and then bugs and bugs me to go. We still are best friends but I still don’t want to because I’m tired. AITA for not sacrificing my own time to be with my good neighbor? Should I give him a better reason instead of saying I’m tired?

"My father has been battling liver cancer for a few years and now is in a stage where a liver transplant is the only option. He lives in a country with strict regulations on organ transplants (to prevent any organ selling), and only close family/relatives are eligible to donate organs. Currently I'm most likely to be the only eligible donor available to him as other members of my family have already tested to be ineligible, and none of our relatives have volunteered either.

As you could have guessed from my post, I'm not particularly close to my parents, and I do not have overwhelming love for my father to want to risk my health for him, especially given that he is in his 60s. I know it's pretty messed up, but if I do donate my liver to him, it'll be due to guilt rather than love or a sense of duty. Does that make me an asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0

I am a manager at a retail store.  The money is ok but benefits are pretty bad.  My fiancee works there as well part-time. She has worked there a couple years while she was in college.  

She is now weeks away from graduating with a BA. The job market is strong in our city so I have high hopes that she will apply and get a job at a more generous company that hopefully offers better benefits.  Concerningly, she just mentioned trying to promote at my location. This promotion does not require a college degree and would pay about 33k.  I know we want children and I can say with my company's insurance that will not be wise as that would be about 20k out of pocket just for medical care.  (Like I said, benefits are not good).  

AITA for encouraging my financee to look for a better job that actually makes use of her degree?  She is pissed and says that I'm trying to sabotage her as well as hit on other people at work. In an attempt to dissuade her I said that if she gets the promotion I would switch schedules so I see her minimally.

bwxdp2	2019-06-05 02:20:27		AITA For trying to fix a friendship that lead to a Facebook friend request that made my friend cut me off?	"Back story: Me (34F) and my now ex friend Karen (33F) have a mutual friend Vicky (33F), Karen and Vicky have been friends for 5 years, myself and Vicky (who met through Karen) have only known of one another for 1 year (met at Karen’s birthday last year, hit it off, became Facebook friends.)

&#x200B;

Karen and her boyfriend of 4 years (on and off) broke up “for good”. During that time, Vicky had met a guy and was getting serious with him. Karen all of a sudden started talking badly about Vicky and telling me all of these things “Vicky disappeared on me” “She deserted me” “She’s never been there for me” Karen then tells me that she defriended Vicky on Facebook and wanted me to do the same exact thing.

&#x200B;

As a good friend to Karen, and not knowing Vicky that well- I went ahead and defriended Vicky. After I did that, Karen demanded I BLOCK Vicky. I didn’t do that because I honestly didn’t feel like it at the time (she was texting me this at work)

I get a message from Vicky asking why Karen isn’t speaking to her and I respond with facts and \*boom\* screenshots of texts between Karen and Vicky proving that every single thing Karen has said or claimed is a lie.

&#x200B;

Then I get a friend request from Vicky... I accepted it because during that time in my life, Karen was being a bitch towards me. She was getting more demanding towards me, getting into arguments about silly things with me, if I didn’t agree with her on anything it turned into a big deal. Also, after finding out A LOT MORE through screenshots I knew that Karen was not someone to be trusted. (Apparently Karen told Vicky all of the secrets...)

&#x200B;

When Karen find out I accepted Vickys friend request, she claimed to another mutual friend that I “chose Vicky” in the friendship. I don’t see me choosing anyone in this situation, I was friends with the both of them, and this was their fight. I would have pushed all of the lies I knew about to the side and continued our friendship but Karen went ahead and blocked me on every single platform and there was no way for me to talk to her about the situation. 

&#x200B;

I don’t know how I chose someone else over Karen since I never ended the friendship- she did. My theory is Karen ended our friendship because she now knew that I knew all of her secrets and lies. (One lie being that she paid for both of Vicky’s brothers funerals)

&#x200B;

So am I the asshole for trying to fix things and accepting a friend request that potentially ended my friendship?

bwxbje	2019-06-05 02:14:17	boeuf_burgignion	AITA for telling my parents I want to go to my doctor’s appointment alone?	"For context, im 19 years old. Last summer I started having stomach cramps and lots of diarrhea. I was concerned and began to think I might have Crohn’s like my grandmother. When I told this to my parents they said it was probably just because of my alimentation (I was on a camping trip). Fast forward to when I’ve come home, I tell them I still have cramps and diarrhea, they say im probably still adapting to my alimentation change. 2 Months later I tell them my situation hasn’t changed, They finally take me seriously and arrange for a doctor’s appointment. I end up having a colonoscopy. The day I have the Operation  I go with my dad, we end up missing the bus. He goes in full panic mode: cursing ,stressing, etc. Im personally pretty zen in life and I don’t get phased too easily, I don’t see missing the bus the end of the world, but when he goes stressing like that it totally ruins my mood. We end up taking an uber to the hospital and arriving kinda late, but you know how it is, it hadn’t been my turn yet. I have the operation (man that camera was bigger than I expected) and the doctor tells us its looking like Crohn’s, but its gonna need an MRI. Again that time dad was stressed and it ruined my mood. Next week I have the appointment with the doctor to look at the results. Tonight at dinner I told my parents I wanted to go to my appointment alone because I yearn to grow up and learn to do these things by myself (also because I don’t want them ruining the mood and creating unnecessary stress, but I can’t say that). Didn’t take too long for my dad to loses his shit, saying be took all my appointments for me, and me doing this is a big fuck you to his face and I do it purposely to hurt him (he always says that) and he stormed out. Stepmom calmly explains to me I shouldn’t go alone because these things can be pretty difficult and you want someone to be by your side and thats its not about age (stills says after im only 19). She concedes that it is important for me to grow up and to take my responsibilities in hand but it’s not the right time. She says I need to be able to ask questions to my doctor and what if im scared and don’t say anything (always what if) She also says I shouldn’t purposely say things to hurt my dad like that whilst I certainly do not do this to pick at him. I personally am not scared by the appointment or hearing the results. I think I am ready and that their arguments are meant to keep me from growing up. Instead I believe they should help me get ready to take on the task. I know Im only 19 and kids my age can tend to believe they know everything, so I always try to keep an open mind and the opinion of a third party can be beneficial.

bwxb07	2019-06-05 02:12:47		WIBTA if I accept this invitation?	"My friend and I are both 25 year old females living in a small town of 900 people. I am... to put it in the most bluntly immodest terms imaginable... extremely attractive in the conventional sense. I don't think I'm particularly vain about it, but I'm not oblivious to the way men react to my looks, either. 


I think my friend would be equally attractive, except that she's carrying A LOT of extra weight. She started really bulking up around 8th grade or so, and it just got worse as time went on. She's pretty insecure about it too, but has never really made any significant effort to correct the problem. This issue has never really come between us... we've been besties since we were ten years old, and if she suffers any jealousy over my broader social circle or much more active dating life, she's never said anything about it.


Recently a single father with three young children moved to town. A moderately famous person... he's a former professional guitarist who has worked with people you have heard of. That in and of itself was sufficient to stir up considerable excitement here in nowheresville, but more than that he's really hot and has a fun, flirty, player personality. I was very attracted to him after the first few words I heard him speak. 


I didn't act on it because my friend set her sights on him, and started flirting which from her is amazing... I've never seen her so bold. So I did the nice best friend thing and stood back. He brushed her off... very kindly and gently, but making it clear he wasn't interested. But I know from talking to her that she hasn't given up yet. 


Today he and I ended up in a social situation together, and he approached me and got really flirty. I flirted back... I couldn't help it... and then he told me that his ex has her visitation with the kids this coming weekend, and invited me for dinner and drinks at his place. I'm not dumb... I know what he has in mind. And *I want it*.


But the specter of my friend is hovering in the background. I know she's really got her sights set on him, but I also know that she's not going to get anywhere. I REALLY want to hook up with this guy, and maybe see if there's anywhere for it to go from there. Am I making a bitch move if I go to his house on Friday?"	No A-holes here	1	0

My mom has been sick for months with a serious illness and has been fighting it for more than 5 months. She hasn’t been able to work and as a small business owner, she hasn’t been able to bill for back work. My dad has taken on all of the work that he can in his business to make up for the loss of her income but it really isn’t enough. Subsequently, he has been working like a madman (70+ hour weeks easily) for the past 5 months. Before my mom got sick, she had my dad do billing for her business. She wanted him to do billing for her while she has been sick but hasn’t on account of all the work he has picked up to pay for everything. She got off the phone today and told me that he didn’t do the billing and he was losing her money in a disappointed tone that seemed critical of him not being able to do this task. I chewed her out for this. I didn’t yell but I raised my voice and reiterated to her that my dad had been doing everything for her the past 5 months and has barely had time to sleep on account of the work that he is doing. She tried to cut me off more than once and I told her to wait. When I was done, she told me that he cost her money and that was it. 

I left shortly after to go to work and my dad came home to my mom in tears saying that she wouldn’t ask my dad for anything else and how helpless she feels.

I don’t know if I’m an asshole for making her cry when she has cancer or if I was justified in calling her on that when she has a history of being critical of my dad for similar things.

I’m super concerned I may lose my job and That I’ve failed to appreciate the ramifications of my actions here. Thanks to anyone taking the time to read it. 

Background: I am a licensed professional in a specialized field. I work in a small (<10 person) office. It is open concept. Everyone is Caucasian except for one admin assistant who is African American (Sarah ~58 yo). For the most part, everyone gets along well enough. I’m not trying to brag or anything but I don’t think anyone in the world hates me. At my worst, I might annoy someone but I’ve never yelled or been mean or made any enemies. Ever. Super non-confrontational.

My wife runs a small home based business. Sarah has bought things from my wife before. We have always had a friendly but not friends relationship. She is not MY admin but we work near each other in this small open office. My grandma passed away recently. Sarah offered condolences and at one point she put $40 on my desk. I don’t recall what she said but it was perceived by me as gas money for the trip to the funeral. As politely as I could I returned the money saying that I appreciate her thoughtfulness but couldn’t accept it. I’m not sure if this is something she does with everyone or if it’s a cultural thing I’ve never heard of before (I’m 30). Regardless, we never talked about it again but I now sense she may have been upset by my actions. 

Fast forward a week or two. We’re all (8 or so of us...my boss is out of town) in the conference room eating lunch. As I alluded earlier, we can be a rowdy bunch. We all tend to have lots to say. Conversations move fast and can usually range from current events, pop culture/entertainment gossip, industry news, or personal. In the CONTEXT of the current topic of conversation (promposals) I brought up a news story in our local paper. I’m scared of being too specific and outing myself but suffice it to say, a local student had gotten in hot water for a racist prom-posal sign. 

Someone asked me what the sign said. I very hesitantly told them what the sign said. It did not include any slurs but made reference  to “blacks picking cotton.” I need to stress, what I said was in a VERY disapproving tone like, “I can’t believe someone would even say such a thing” At that point in time, Sarah halts the conversation, says we shouldn’t talk about this around her, and that we need to change the subject RIGHT NOW. there was a long awkward silence until we could all kind of shift gears to something else. 

After the lunch I asked one of Sarah’s more closer co workers if Sarah was upset. She told me she didn’t see why she would be, not to apologize, and to just let sleeping dogs lie.

My gf was given a flute in the 9th grade bc she did not have one/wasn’t told it was just for school. She was told she could have the flute. Towards the end of her senior year the band director asks everybody in class if they have any instruments they were willing to sell to him so kids that can’t afford instruments could use or have them as back-ups. Of course after 4 years of using the flute, she completely forgets about it and sells it to the band director. Fast forward to now, she just finished her 2nd year in college. This is over 6 years ago. The lady texts her saying she wants her flute back. My gf has offered to pay her back, Buy her a new flute, Work  for her, and has even texted the band director asking if he still has the flute. The lady is now posting about her on Facebook saying since she sold the flute out from under her, who’s to say she won’t still pills from patients in the future(going to be an RN). Is she the a-hole?

bwx6ix	2019-06-05 01:59:46	dilemma_TA	AITA for wanting to tell my best friend's ex he was having an affair?	"Dan and Donna have been together over 14 years. Donna was my friend first and a very close friend but throughout the years Dan has become my best friend. We talk about all our problems together, he was the best man at my wedding, etc. 

2 years ago Dan started having an affair and told me about 1 year later. At that time, their relationship started falling apart. Dan feeling guilty tried to work things out with Donna, but still saw his new girl on the side. They went to couples therapy, he went to therapy alone, but they finally broke up about 6 months ago. 

Obviously Donna is a sad depressed mess. 10 years ago Dan and Donna bought a house together, with money borrowed from Dan's parents and Donna's good credit. That house appreciated substantially, and since Donna thinks it's her fault for the relationship not working out. Dan put in the work renovating it, while they split the mortgage evenly. Since Donna is so depressed, she wants to just walk away from the house and give Dan the entire house. Dan privately told me he is going to throw her a bone and give her a small amount, since he considers the work he put in equity. I tried to suggest to both of them separately to sell the house and split the proceeds, but Dan wants the house, and Donna just wants to walk away from everything.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I have had dinner w/ Donna over 10 times in the last few months urging her to split the house. She said she doesn't care and can make the money back. I don't think she's thinking rationally. 

&#x200B;

Dan told me in confidence that he deserves the house bc it's his parents money, and he did the work. All Donna did was pay half the mortgage. Dan also told me during his therapy sessions he discusses the guilt he has for cheating on Donna, but he still wants the house.

So reddit aita for wanting to tell Donna anonymously that Dan has been having an affair so she gets her fair share of the house?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwx6fx	2019-06-05 01:59:30	tikothecat	WIBTA To not pay a friend back	Yesterday three of my friends and I went on a day trip and ended up at a restaurant for lunch that was expensive. Bread was not included, but five dollars more, and so we ordered it for the table. The tab was not split so one of my friends used her card to pay and the rest of us were to pay her back. I calculated the cost of my meal with a tip and tax, and venmoed it to her. She later inquired to me regarding the cost of the meal, and that she was about 5 dollars short which she attributed to the bread. She then asked me for payment for a quarter of the bread and its tax and tip. Normally I would obviously pay her, but earlier that day I bought half of the day pass for a park that we went to, which was 5 dollars for me and 5 for another. Neither she nor another girl contributed to the pass, and so I figured that they would buy the bread as a way of sort of repaying us halfway. Would I be the asshole to ignore any further request for the payment regarding the bread? Or should I just suck it up and pay the few dollars?	Asshole	0	0

bwx5h5	2019-06-05 01:56:51		AITA for not believing a pet owner?	"Hey so today i got a call for my business saying a dog has kennel cough. The owner wants to blame my boarding service because i gave her dog a bordetella vaccine upon arrival. Kennel cough has a 5 to 10 day gestation peroid. Her dog was at my service a month ago for 1 night. Dogs can get kennel cough at dog parks. Meeting other neighbor dogs. At any area annother dog can be in proximity. Dogs can even catch kennel cough from my kennel if its a strain not vaccinated against. 

This owner wasnt up to date on their vaccinations they claimed they were going to the vet 3 days after the overnight stay. The only reason i agreeded to this. Was she said her grandmother got hospitalized (or her mother i cant remember which) and she wanted to stay over night 3 hours away. Guess i learned my lesson for being nice?

I also called my vet services to ask if it was possible for the dog to have gotten it from my service (all the dogs that were in my boarding services the night of that dogs visit were vaccinated for kennel cough by their vets.) And all my vet would tell me is i shouldnt of given an oral kennel cough vaccine that made me liable and i should always tell ppl to take their dog to their vet. But wouldnt inform me of gestation peroids or likely hood of it being my services fault. I called annother vet in town who did inform me of the gestation peroid and the fact there are atleast 4 common strains of kennel cough. The most common being bordetella.

SO AITA if I dont believe the pet owners dog got kennel cough from my service because of the length of gestation plus the amount of time since the dog has been at my service? It is possible but her dogs been sick for atleast 1-2 weeks w.o vet care before today.

TLDR Pet owner doesnt understand how bordetella vaccine works blames my boarding service for kennel cough."		1	0
bwx5ca	2019-06-05 01:56:28	princessofmed	WIBTA if I refuse to move in with my bf of 3 years if he buys this house with his friend and brother?	"My boyfriend (25 M) and I (20 F) have been together for three years. I’ve been so extremely ready to move in together since about the one year mark of our relationship. I’ve been kind of annoyed over the past six months that we have not moved in together. Btw, he lives with his alcoholic and insane mother and I live with my mom, step father, and 14 year old brother. Both of our home lives are not the greatest, so this has added tremendously to me wanting to move out. 

One huge problem is that I am a full time student. I am very fortunate to have my mom paying for my college education, but she has told me many times that I cannot have a job while in school or she will no longer pay for it. The reason for this is because I am trying to get into medical school and she wants my 100% focus to be on school. This means that the financial responsibility of moving out is going to be solely on my boyfriend. This is a huge reason we have not moved out yet and I have been more understanding that we haven’t. 

About 3 months ago, my boyfriend started looking into buying a home for us in the small town that my college is located in. I grew up in this town and it’s a great area. I’ve been super excited that he was looking in this area. At one point he mentioned his brother (28 M) may “go in on” the house. My mom was worried about this because she feels his brother is a bit too involved. His brother lives in another state and is very well off for his age. I also kind of had thoughts of being uncomfortable in the home I’m living in, knowing that his brother partially owns it. This could be especially awkward when he comes in to town. 

A week ago I found out the plan has completely changed. His brother and one close friend (25 M) are now all going in on a house and they have their very own ideas of where to get the house. They are looking at houses in an extremely bad area of Atlanta that has a very bad reputation and is pretty unsafe. I’m not comfortable with this and my parents are especially not. This friend is now apparently going to be living in the house and I’m not comfortable with this either. He is crazy and definitely a party animal, doing cocaine and staying out until 5 in the morning. 

I know I have absolutely no say in this because I’m not putting any money into the house. My boyfriend is all excited that we may actually be moving in together soon, and this is the first time I’m questioning everything. I feel I am unable to bring up these concerns because, again, I really have no place to talk. If he buys this house with his brother and friend I may have to refuse to move in and then I don’t know what that would mean for our relationship."	No A-holes here	0	0

Once the movie started he kept talking and I realized there was no one next to him nor did he have a cellphone, he was just talking to himself. I kept my eye on him as he seemed distressed and kept talking to himself. At one point he gets up and starts to pace back and forth on the aisle while still mumbling. He seems to be wearing multiple layers of clothes and I can’t seem to see his face as he appeared to have a scarf ( notice it’s Texas and the weather is in the 90•s) in which I look at my wife and we both agree to exit the room and find a manager or security.

bwx3x5	2019-06-05 01:52:18	gasping9870	AITA for not doing what my boss told me due to an injured kid?	"So, I am on the mat of a martial arts dojo, assisting the head instructor, my boss, with a class. The head instructor led the warm-up, and while the kids were getting water, told me to lead stretches right after. As I was heading to the front of the mat to begin leading them, I was approached by a student who said she was bleeding. I immediately take her to the desk, since my coworker was currently talking to some customers and was unavailable. She showed me her wound, a fairly nasty 1/2 inch cut on her toe. At this point, my coworker finishes up, comes to the desk, asks what's wrong, and upon seeing the wound, instructed me to grab paper towels while she sprayed the wound with antiseptic. She needed paper towels to clean up blood and to dab off the antiseptic (a spray) so that a band-aid would stick. I got the paper towels, she put on the band-aid, and I wrapped the band-aid with tape so that it would stay until the class, meanwhile instructing her on what to do with the wound after the class (maybe 2-5 minutes altogether) After I finish patching her up, I return to the mat, where the head instructor continued leading class. 

I thought nothing of the incident until after class, when I went over to ask for our paychecks. He refused to write them (due to an invalid reason), and then later returned to me and started yelling at me, in front of a student, the parents, and my coworker, that if I ignore him one more time when he tells me to do something, \[something I don't remember\], and that it made him very angry when I ignored him. I was pissed that he yelled at me, and proceeded to leave the dojo so as to not disturb the class.

Once I left, I texted him explaining what happened, that I was helping an injured student, and that ""I was under the impression that student health takes priority over anything."" He responded stating, ""where was \[coworker\]? At the desk (*even though she wasn't at the time I was notified of the injury*). The person at the desk does the medic job. That's how its always been."" He then said, ""what you should have done is walk \[student\] over to \[coworker\], and that would have taken you 30 seconds. Instead you chose to not do what I asked because it seemed like a bother. Unfortunately if you decide to have that attitude at a job where the employer doesn't put up with that they usually just fire you."" After this mini-tirade, I responded that I never treated this job as a bother, that despite mistreatment I stayed because I cared about this job, but this was the last straw. I soon after stated that that was my last day at the job.

Now I understand if it was some important technique or part of class, but stretches in my mind are less of a priority than an injured kid. I have no regrets for leaving, but I am wondering if I was TA for not doing what my boss told me to do, due to the situation I described above."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwx3sk	2019-06-05 01:51:56	unbelievablybleu	AITA for feeling this way?	"So a little backstory. Me and my family have been going through hard times . My husband has had health issues and I have had some job issues.  So I moved back home and we asked my parents if we could temporarily move in until we get on our feet. They said yes and we offered to help them with their home a bit because they said it was mess. 

*** we have jobs now and are saving up for a place **

Mess does not cover it. 
1) they have way too many dogs 
2) the house smells like pee and poop because they have so many ( I've repeatedly tried cleaning the floors)
3) they sometimes will let the stuff sit there and wont pick it up until their out of their coma.  (I've been cleaning it when I see it)

The whole house is cluttered with tools and random stuff . Like its unbelieveable . I have tried to get them up and moving to clear some stuff out ..I have even offered the help and they can just tell me what to move.  and they are always saying how hurt their back is or how tired they are . I have a feeling they're a little too dependent on the pain pills. 

**But with all of this I just push it to the side and I try my best to help still because they were nice enough to give us a place to be . 

But then they are constantly asking for stuff. Like pop,vape juice (because I got my husband to stop smoking and move to vaping and hopefully eventually quit) and snacks that are for the kids. They have asked me to run up to the store to get pop and I've done it because again they gave us a place to be. I bought my mom a 70$ vape  because I wanted her to be healthier and not smoke around the kids. She even put food into our cart while we were shopping for food for the kids and didnt ask if it was ok. 

But the final straw is when I make pretty decent family meals that I make so everyone can eat. It's not cheap either.  Last night i cooked almost 20 lbs of hamburger meat for chili and as of today there barely isnt any left and my two older kids and husband only had one bowl each. 

So my main point is its costing me an arm and a leg to try to feed everyone . But part of me wants to stop making such big meals and only make smaller portions and not feed them with our meals anymore. 

Ps: Neither of my parents have a job they are living off of my elderly grandfather who isnt all there.

We just recently moved into an apartment because staying in the previous home where they separated was too hard on her and she wanted to move on from her marriage. They agreed on co-parenting the children and he usually comes over at night to see his daughters. 
 
Well for the past month or so he’s been sleeping over almost every night. Sometimes he sleeps in the living room other times he sleeps with my sister in her room.  He sleeps here For no reason, he doesn’t live far and there’s no way he’s “tired” because he used to “work” until 3am (he was actually cheating on my sister) and still leave at 5 am for his shift. When they first separated he moved in with his brother, and I have the suspicion that they have been arguing because he’s an asshole like that (it’s one of the main reasons for their separation) because that has to be why he’s constantly over at our house.

I feel uncomfortable with him sleeping here because I can’t walk around freely in my home without having to worry him being in the living room. My names on the lease, this is my home now not his. When we all 3 lived together I understood our personal space and privacy and did not do anything like walking around in my underwear because we shared a home and his name was also on the lease. But now it’s my home and he doesn’t live here but yet he’s sleeping over every night.  And I still have to act like how I used to but I don’t feel like I should because again HE DOESN’T LIVE HERE. I don’t like that I feel uncomfortable in my own home. I can’t walk to my fridge at 3am to get a glass of water in my underwear because I have to worry that’s He’s right next to the kitchen probably awake on his phone. 

I told my sister about how I felt and she said she would talk to him. She talked to him today and he just stayed quiet and a few minutes later he left without saying a thing. I feel like he might be upset at my sister because He feels he has a right to be able to have a sleepover with his daughters. Which I’m not saying he can’t do, of course if it’s super late he can stay over. But what I’m saying is not every single night.  I just want him to limit his sleep overs.

My late husband had 4 kids with an ex wife, and the kids were alienated from him.

Once we married, his life was back on track, he got a job and paid child support, and a tentative rapport began between him and his kids. (They lived in a different state, so the rapport was mostly texting and phone calls.) Tragically, as this just started to bloom, my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer and after a 3 year fight, died at the age of 44, leaving behind these 4 kids. They were all teenagers when he died.

I tried my best to be kind and supportive to them all, but we weren’t given a lot of time to become close. After my husband died, I did not maintain a deep contact with them, although I contacted them about the death, offered what pictures, clothes, belongings I could to them, as they had very little from their dad and obviously had a lot of emotions to process.

It’s been 8? Years since he passed, and his youngest daughter has reached out to be messenger friends, and we’ve exchanged friendly how-are-you type messages for about a year. She told me that she is on disability and doesn’t work, and has struggled with a drug addiction and did rehab. 

She lamented about 6 months ago that she didn’t have pictures of her dad and her from when she was a kid and I immediately dug through my husbands old picture albums and sent her all of the pictures I could find of him and the kids. She was very grateful. All was good.

Randomly a week ago I got a message from her (hadn’t heard from her in months) and she is asking for money, and the gist of the message sounds *very* “addict” to me (my dad was an alcoholic and I’ve been exposed to lots of addicts). She asked me to PayPal her some money “for groceries just to make it to the end of the month.” I immediately worried she was maybe needing money for drugs and I didn’t know what to do. She’s never asked me for money before.

So I replied hey, I’m traveling (which was true,) and said I’d get back to her, and then honestly forgot about the convo (I was traveling, applying for a new job, finishing a college class, and a ton of other things were going on.)

I got an angry message from her yesterday (it’s been about a week) that said something along the lines of “you could have just told me you weren’t going to give me any money instead of stringing me along”. 

I deleted the text and didn’t respond. Boundaries and confrontations are my weakness. My heart is heavy that she’s had a difficult life, but my “addict behavior radar” is also pinging loudly.

AITA for just ghosting the convo? Should I reply?

TL;DR- kid from my late husband messaged me asking for money, and she has a history of addiction. I said I’d get back to her and forgot, and she messaged me angrily saying I could have at least told her I wasn’t going  to send her money. I haven’t replied. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwwzkx	2019-06-05 01:39:59	narsfweasels	AITA - Please don't spend money for me?	"I'm conflicted on this one: 

We just had a group of grad students come through from overseas to work with us and observe how we work, they were unpaid but everything inclusive of accomodation and food was covered by their school. We received nothing extra from supervising them on the projects they brought with them and the work that we were doing at the same time. They've been a great help, and at the same time, we've given hours of feedback and walked them through a lot of procedures that are proprietary to us and current in the industry as a whole. They're leaving the placement with many, many valuable skills and work experience that helps put them ahead in the field. 

Last night they invited us out to dinner, indicating that they wanted to treat us, and while we agreed to join them for dinner, we flat out refused to accept thrm paying -to the point where we were constantly reminding each other to keep track of our individual bills.

I had to leave early, so I paid up my drinks and food, which came to about $25 -over the objections of the interns ""I'm not letting you poor students pay, you don't earn anything!"" say my goodbyes and leave. 

Next moring, our overall Project Supervisor came in and said ""As per last night, I need another $35 from everyone to cover the bill for the interns.""

After I left, Supervisor decided that the night was on us, basically. Everyone in the office git out their wallets, and put in their $35. I also did so, but the look on my face must have given it away. 

""Something wrong, Narsfs?""

""Yeah... kind of... I didn't agree to this... I mean, I'll also pay... but er..."" 

Then someone calls out ""Don't be an asshole, we all agreed!""

I mumbled that I wasn't there when this agreement was made. A colleague on the project called me aside later and said I just should have kept quiet, paid up and not say a word, regardless of how I felt.

bwwzkr	2019-06-05 01:39:59		AITA for blocking my aunt	"My aunt through marriage has the same name as me. A few months ago she messaged me saying she was getting calls from collectors (looking for me). She demanded my phone number.

I briefly described my situation and said I'd give her my number but as soon as I started getting calls I'd be changing my number. I also explained that I wanted to repay my debts but am far from able to at this time and apologized for sharing a name. She says don't worry about giving her my number at the time and she wished she could get her maiden name back and kick my ass*ole p*ick uncle out. 

So tonight I get another passive aggressive message that the calls are pissing her off ALOT and can I please get a hold of them to set up a payment plan. 

I know how annoying collectors calls are. I was called for 2 years for a guy I didn't know. So I told her again that I was sorry they were harassing her. I have an appointment to talk about filing for bankruptcy, I would give her my number but as soon as I started to get called I would be changing my number. And if that was an issue I would remove her from my friend's list because I have enough to deal with. Then I impulsively blocked her before she could reply. 

So am I the asshole? Should I have given her my number?  I feel if she was a bit nicer messaging me it could've went differently. I plan on settling my debts or filing for bankruptcy in the coming weeks if that matters at all...


SO everyone says YTA. People seem to think that I did this on purpose to inconvenience her which isn't the case.  I will probably unblock her and give her my # in a few days and if she's too pissed about everything I will remove her from all social media. Thanks for your input!

A few months ago, an artist on Etsy sent me dozens of copyright complaint notices for Pinterest. The emails Pinterest sent me about it didn’t tell me which one of the hundreds of boards the content was on. I was very upset, and so I contacted her on Etsy, and was quite rude at first. I apologized for it once I had calmed down and searched my entire account to the best of my ability and removed all of her content that I could find and even boards I might though have her content on it. She appreciated this, and I assured her that I was happy to comply with her and remove any additional content of hers she may find in the future, and to please let me know if she runs into the issue again so I can take care of it right away. I wished her the best of luck in all her endeavors, and that appeared to be that. 

Now, I took a nap a few hours ago. When I woke up, I discovered I received dozens and dozens of copyright complaint emails from the same woman. My account has been suspended indefinitely, and will be deleted in fourteen days- All because she didn’t contact me directly. Now, I don’t use that account anymore. I contacted Pinterest and explained the situation, and to please just go ahead and delete my account. I’m pretty pissed that this woman didn’t just contact me directly. I made the board before I understood copyrights, when I was much younger, and happily complied with her need for the content to be removed, and now my entire account is getting deleted. Even though I don’t use it anymore, I’m furious. I feel like she’s being a total bitch for no reason. 

I contacted her again, and I very politely told her that I understand copyright is important to her, and if she’d have told me there was still her content on the account, I’d have taken care of it right away. I also informed her that I didn’t appreciate her mass reporting me again when we’d discussed it previously. I was pretty formal about it, I didn’t go off at her or anything, but I’m pretty pissed about it.

bwwu3j	2019-06-05 01:24:24	Dark_Winter_Rose	AITA for taking the GameCube?	" 

This is my first Reddit post ever so please bear with me...

Backstory:  I have a younger sister who is freeloading at my dad's house and I  moved away from home. The reason I moved was because my sister is  verbally abusive of my dad and me, and I couldn't take the environment  anymore. We are both adults in our 20s and I was almost done college  anyway. So, anyway, I was visiting when I noticed our GameCube that we  shared as kids was gathering dust from not being used, so I asked my dad  if I could take it (since it was technically his since he paid for it  and it was in his house). Since it was covered in dust we both assumed  my sister wasn't using it, so he let me take it.

Fast forward 5 months, and I get a call from my sister. The conversation goes more or less like this:

Sister (S), shouting: How DARE you take the GameCube?! You didn't ask me if it was okay!

Me, not completely registering what she said yet: I'm sorry...what?

S: You took the GameCube and I wanted to play tonight and now it's not here! Why do you act like you can do whatever you want?!

And  then she started going on a tirade where I couldn't get a word in  edgewise. So, not even registering what she is saying anymore, I hang  up. I'm tired from a long day and I don't feel like being yelled at.

She  then sends me a series of texts about how I can't keep it and I have to  give it back. Now, for the record, if she had asked me nicely to bring  it back home, I would have been fine with doing so. I told her that I  would appreciate if she would ask instead of demanding it, and noted to  her that I thought she wasn't using it anymore because of the dust.

She then texts me ""You cant freaking control me. I finally have a chance to play it and you took it without asking!""

So  I tell her once again I will give it back when she asks, and when I get  an apology for being yelled at as soon as I had picked up the phone and  she then accuses me of GASLIGHTING her. I told her I don't think she's  using that word correctly, and she doesn't even answer to that and tells  me she is coming to my apartment in the early morning to pick it up.  We're talking about 8am here. I told her I have testing at the hospital  at 8:15 (which I do) and will not be home by the time she gets to my  apartment and she starts demanding I tell my roommate to give it to her.  She doesn't believe me when I tell her my roommate will be at work.

It's  been left at that at this point and I admit I probably should have been  courteous and asked her if I could take it, despite it obviously having  not been used for years. But I think this is over the top. But is she  justified in her reaction? Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I have chosen my bridesmaids and asked them to all wear pantsuits as I'll be wearing a pantsuit and don't really like dresses. I've always been a ""tomboy"" but I still do want to do a bigger wedding same with my fiance. 

I have a total of 5 bridesmaids and 2 of them are saying that wearing a pantsuit as a bridesmaid seems ""ridiculous"" and that they don't like wearing pantsuits. The other 3 are onboard and like the idea, although 1 definitely seems more just ""doing it for me"" which is fine but I'd rather they all match. And uniform suits across the couple and bridesmaids and groomsmen I find very aesthetically pleasing (we will be wearing a different colored suits, I'm thinking purple). 

I've talked to the 2 that are holding out and they keep saying it's just ""weird"" and that I'm being a bridezilla. I dont have any other explanation as to why. My parents say I should just let them ""do what they want"" my fiance agrees that theyre being ridiculous.

bwwt7i	2019-06-05 01:21:39		AITA for turning down pictures with friends and family?	"I'm a 20 year old female with body dysmorphia. I hate photos of myself and having photos taken of myself. Not just because of extreme self esteem issues, but I also don't see the point of constantly taking photos.  I don't want to stop and take pictures everywhere I go. I don't see the point of showing the world that I go places or hang out with people over Instagram. 

Lately a couple of my friends have been saying they don't have any pictures with me and wish they did. They've been insisting I don't care for them as much as they care for me. They don't know about my body dysmorphia, but forgetting about that for a second, I feel like they should accept that I just don't like pictures of myself. I feel like they're too self concerned when it comes to this issue. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel like my friends (some family too) don't take pictures to reflect on memories, but just to show off to the world about where they go and who they try to be and I don't want any part in that. My friends especially are making me feel like a total asshole because I don't take selfies or pictures with them."		1	0
bwwsxh	2019-06-05 01:20:50		AITA for not going to my stepdaughter’s birthday party?	"Okay so little background, my husband has a 10y old (SD) with his ex wife, I’ve been in stepdaughter’s life since she was 4, we share 50/50 custody. His ex wife is cool, love her, great woman, I can definitely call her my friend and she’s been nice and accepting of me since the beginning, has always involved me in SD’s life. My husband and his ex wife have a good coparenting relationship too over all. 

Ex wife got remarried, SD’s stepdad came in the picture when SD was 7, so a few years later than me. He acts nice, we’ve been accepting of him, he’s not a bad guy. But, he’s an extreme show off and is extremely jealous and insecure. Don’t completely blame him, I was there once too. 

But recent events have (silently) annoyed me and my husband when it comes to SD’s stepdad. We appreciate him loving SD, but he tries to top us with everything. We bought SD an iPod for our house, two weeks later, stepdad buys SD an iPod AND iPad.. He will brag to SD, in front of us, how expensive the things he has bought for her are. Every time we pick SD up from her mom’s house, stepdad needs to go “I love you so much baby when you come back we will do this and that etc” ... every single time.. and it’s not even small things he talks about, it’s like Disneyland, vacations, shopping etc. Now all SD is talking about is going back there so she can do what stepdad promised to do. 

SD is not materialistic, at all. Buying her things isn’t going to win her over. Loving her and spending time with her is.. the list goes on and on with things.. Last week at SD’s school even, he felt the need to brag to me and my husband that SD wanted Dunkin Donuts, despite the closest one being 30 minutes away, and I quote stepdad “of course I went and get it for my baby, I got her three dozen!” .. 

My husband isn’t insecure, he isn’t bothered by it because he knows that he is SDs dad. But I can’t help but be bothered by it. What makes this all worse, is that stepdad has a daughter from a previous relationship and does not go to his daughter’s school events. But makes sure to never miss any of SD’s.. 

So here’s my issue. SD turned 10 a month ago. Ex wife is throwing her a party at stepdad’s parents house, we are invited like usual. My husband often works on Saturdays, so usually I go by myself. He can’t make it to the party, and I told ex wife that I won’t be coming. (Because I am just nothing but uncomfortable around stepdad)

Now I feel a bit conflicted. I can’t decide if I’m the asshole here, because I’m the end it’s not about me or stepdad, it’s about SD. But I also feel that I have good reasons to distance myself.

"One of my really good friends from middle school(we just graduated college, for time context) has to find a new apartment and is temporarily staying with a family member where he cant bring his cat. He asked me if I’d take wally in and I immediately said yes. 

My mom was a little hesitant and was complaining for a few days while he was locked in my room so I could adjust him, but she eventually cleared up an empty room he can stay in. I started letting him roam the house so he can get acclimated, but he isnt getting any better. I understand moving cats around is hard, hes been extremely nervous and is hissing at members of my family whenever they pass by him around the house. 

He has peed on a couple of big furniture items like the couch, some chairs, and even the floor in the living room. I know it takes time for cats to adjust to a new place but my mom is pushing me and fighting me everyday to get my friend to take the cat back. My friend has no choice but to put him in a shelter until he finds a place because none of our other friends can apparently take the cat in either. I tried my hardest for almost 3 weeks to try to get him adjusted but I cant keep running the risk of having him ruin expensive furniture and to keep causing tension in my family. Am I a monster because I tried my hardest but this isnt working? The thought of him going to a shelter absolutely destroys me and I wanna breakdown."	No A-holes here	0	0

Some background information, We had been dating for 5 years and we're living together for about a year when I proposed to her. She said yes but didn't want to tell her parents until she was done with school (getting her masters, and her mom has never liked even going as far as threatening to pull her school funding when we started to live together.) Now of course I was fine with it, so fast forward 2 years and she has finally graduated, and was having trouble finding a job in her field, but she found one that is 4+ hours away so of course that involves the need to move, but by this time she still hasn't told her family about the engagement, so I told her that if she wanted me to also move then she had to tell her family, but all that did was bring up a fight about how they won't except it because we aren't financially stable yet, but I know her family and they won't be happy even if I was bringing in 6 figures, FYI I'm currently making about 45k a year in a state of low cost of living.

I’m out of high school now but still think about it, I’ve since tried to befriend her again but when I contact her she tells me she’s over me. I just feel the friendship was ended so suddenly that it still hurts, I’ve become really mad at her about this and people tell me that it’s not my fault but I can’t help but think that it is.

I love my wife she is a fantastic mum and I could not ask for anyone better to raise my kids. I am the only one that works in the household and she is a stay at home by choice. 

My problem being is she is incredibly messy herself we have a 2 and 4 year old and the house is just a wreck constantly. She may do washing once a week, the floor never gets swept up, things are never put back. My two year old spilt juice on the sofa and my wife has just let it sit there all day. 

She doesn't drive atm so me and her family do the bulk of the errand running. I don't expect the house to be immaculate but I believe being a stay at home mum/dad brings a certain responsibility that being making sure the house is in relatively good shape. It stresses me out to come home from.a super long day and their are nappies everywhere, toilet bins full, dirty floors etc etc

bwwkji	2019-06-05 00:57:01	ramsaso	AITA to interfere with my father's decisions?	"Let's just say over the past few years, my dad has resisted trying to get the home A/C unit replaced because it *costs money, he says.*

Even when our A/C unit is over 14 years old and the air handler that's from 2003?

We have had to service our A/C *almost constantly* because of my Dad being so cheap and as a result, the family has to suffer (4 in total) in the sense that at night in Houston, we are unbearably hot. I understand that money is tight right now in the family.

Just recently, the compressor has failed and its leaking refrigerant into the air as we speak because of a ""tolerable leak"" that had to be soldered when the leak was big, back in 2012. The refrigerant and the air handler is R22 by the way.

My dad's trusted technician, who we shall call ""Randy"" (bonded) went up to the roof of our apartment unit (which we own) and told him that we would have to replace the whole system. 

Even before he got the news, the A/C was not adequately cooling down the unit very well due to the hot heat and weather here in Houston. 

My father said to me, “Let me take care of it”. 

Knowing my dad was trying to be a cheap ass once again, I thought a second opinion might be warranted since this is a huge investment for our home so I called up several companies in Houston, wanting to get information and quotes and I got two as of right now. 

One of them was for a Trane System 16 SEER for only $4,500. Upon speaking to people on HVAC talk discord, they said it was a good deal since it included labor and all.

However, upon speaking to my father about this, he said and I quote, “I’m waiting for Randy to give me an A/C system for around ***$1,000***”. 

I kid you not, **One thousand dollars**. Total.

I became very agitated and later, lost my composure upon learning about this because

1. He’s being cheap again.

2. I’m worried that the installation costs is not included and the installation is going to be shoddy, to say the least.

3. The A/C might not be able to cool down our unit efficiently = higher energy bills

4. The Condo. Association might get us evicted because of the installers not being bonded.

and so on.

I spoke with Father privately in the master bedroom what people's opinions are on the Discord channel as well as what people from companies are saying and he said that he doesn't want to listen to second opinions and to stay out of it.

That would be why I got agitated because I am aware that it's my parent's place and technically, I(20M) am living here rent-free because of their good-will and nature but I just don't want to see my parents ripped off and the house not being cooled down adequately again.

I guess this is where I would say, AITA for interfering with my father's decisions?"	Asshole	0	0

I promptly informed him it was joke, then said “My bad” to which he responded with “IT IS YOUR BAD. YOUR SUCH A DICK”.

She's always wanted to be a police officer and the next recruitment opens in 9 months. In our country you cannot apply to be a police officer if you have been prescribed anxiety/depression medication in the prior 9 months. 

My gf has been on this medication for 2 years for severe depression and anxiety.

As she wants to apply for the police force she made the decision to stop taking her medication a month ago. During the past month she has been struggling to cope with standard daily stressors such as her makeup, cooking or running late. It's been to the point where she bursts into tears momentarily whilst getting visibly frustrated and slamming things around. She's very short and gets very snappy with me during these times.

The rest of the time she's perfect, and always apologises for her outbursts after she's calmed back down. She doesn't get frustrated at me directly, but I'm getting really concerned as to what happens when it comes to selection or actual duty and she encounters stressors? 

When I asked her about this, she said ""we'll have to see, I think I can handle it though."" 

I'm really concerned this is not healthy. She was in therapy but couldn't afford it anymore and AFAIK hasn't consulted the doctor or any therapist about doing this.

I discovered this through needing to borrow my mom’s laptop one day recently for a school project because mine was not working, and realized that the open tabs included my brother’s Facebook account open with his messages featured on the screen. 

This could be explained away as my brother having borrowed the laptop similarly to what I was doing, and logged into his account himself, however this is not the case as my brother attends a college out of state and was not even residing in the same state at the time. I thought it was odd initially, but I didn’t think too much of it because I got distracted with my school work and forgot about it. Since that occasion, I have needed to borrow my mom’s laptop at least 4 more times and the exact same thing has happened each time- my brother’s facebook account is open with his messages tab being displayed on the screen, as if my mom had just been lurking through his private messages right before I asked to use her computer. This does not seem like normal or justifiable behavior for a parent of a 22 year old, and I’m not even sure if it’s legal. Since this is obviously a habit of hers, I feel very strongly that my brother should be made aware so that he can take action to change his password and confront her about this (or do whatever he wants with the info, I just think he should know). But I’m unsure if this is ethical of me to do, as I know it will cause family drama and that my mother will resent me for this, and my brother will likely not be too happy with her after learning this. I just don’t know if this is a situation where I should just let everything be or if I am justified in “stirring the pot”. I know that if it were my messages that were being read I would definitely want to know. I am just unsure on what the best way to proceed is in terms of being a decent person. Thank you all in advance for your for your input.

TL;DR I’ve (19F) caught my mom with my brother’s (22M) Facebook account and messages open on her laptop on 5 occasions now- would I be the asshole if I make my brother aware and potentially be the cause of the downfall of their relationship?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwwgjn	2019-06-05 00:45:31	e96_	AITA for not wanting a memory table at my wedding?	"I was talking with my fiancée this evening and wanted to get opinions on this.

My future MIL suggested getting a memory table for our wedding where we can put the names and photos of people like our grandparents and my mother, who passed away ten years ago.  My initial reaction is that I don’t want one.

The reason why is that my family, my aunt and cousin in particular, always seem to make events in my life about my mother (e.g. “your mother would be so proud,” and “I miss your mom every day I wish she were here,” or their favorite “something something smiling down from heaven.”) I’m sure this will happen at my wedding anyway, but I think a memory table would just invite this and I don’t like it.

I get everyone remembers those who have passed on differently, but I don’t choose to do it this way.  And, it can bother me when they direct it at me, especially since it feels like every major positive event in my life is overshadowed by the fact my mother isn’t alive to be there for it.  To me, I just think it would be easier to not have it at all.

So, AITA?  My fiancée is understanding, but I don’t want to not have one if she wants it, and I don’t want to upset her mother since it was her suggestion."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwwe97	2019-06-05 00:38:45	throwaway6262776	Aita in this “relationship ?”	"So. I met a girl online about 2 years ago. She lives 5 hours away, and other than her saying she “doesn’t want me being with others,” we have never had a formal relationship. We don’t do holidays. We don’t celebrate anniversaries. We don’t say “I love you, (not even once.” We have not planned our lives together.  We have not really talked about a future because she’s on such a different chapter of life. We are very different so, even doing normal interests is a bit strained because she’s a bigger homebody, and I’m always out living life differently. 

We see each other 6 to 8 times a year. It’s usually enjoyable, low key, we have sex... we talked daily. 

Since January, I’ve been withdrawing from our unofficial relationship, until 2 days ago when I finally decided to put this thing out of its misery (“the relationship “). I feel guilty and terrible because I recognize she’s hurting, but I don’t see how if you are not actively acknowledging your relationship through gestures, speech and decisions that constitute a solid relationship, how you can even say that one may have even existed (unless it was actually acknowledged that a relationship exists).

Am I asshole?


Edit: Thank you to all who kindly took the time to respond. It has certainly helped me acknowledge the situation."	No A-holes here	0	0
bwwe63	2019-06-05 00:38:29	Curly-H	AITA for wanting to make my friend jealous?	"I’m about to be a senior in high school, and I have a very close friend who I’ll refer to as S.

Let me start by saying how much I’ve grown in high school. I know I’m not even seventeen yet but freshman year I was antisocial, insecure, & awkward. Granted, most freshmen are. But over the past years I’ve learned a lot about self-growth & have improved myself greatly. I ate healthier & dressed better & built my confidence. If there was something I didn’t like about my life, I changed it.  It wasn’t easy but I always thanked myself later

S has struggled with her weight her entire teenage life. We were both insecure (her with her weight, me with general body dysmorphia) when we met & in a way bonded over that. But it’s come to my attention this year that we can no longer have so much in common.

S complains that she feels fat, that she isn’t pretty, that she wishes she was friends with some other people in our school who she considers “above” us. She complains greatly about the kind of person she wants to be.

It occurred to me recently how much S talks about wanting to change & never does it. Like, never. She claims she doesn’t like her weight yet at least once every few hours she says she’s hungry, even if we ate lunch not long before. She always finishes her meal & sighs that she’s still hungry, then goes to get more. Additionally, she shows up to school in lazy clothes. Which is fine, but nearly once a week she says “you know, I could try if I wanted to. I just don’t.” I’ve seen her dressed nicely before for school & know she enjoys it. But she hasn’t done that in a while. One time we were spending the night at a friend’s house & I was applying moisturizer & she joked, “y’know, I love how you guys do all this face stuff & I can barely like, brush my teeth in the morning.”

Another time in class, she asked me if I ever wished I was prettier than I am. I told her “no” in the most humble voice I could. (Genuinely, I think I’m pretty & don’t really stress about what I can be if I know I’m doing my best to feel good about myself.) She rolled her eyes & said in a disgusted voice, “well I’m happy for YOU!”

It irks me. Bad.

So bad that when summer pulls up, I want to have a better body than her. I want to be prettier than her. I want her to look at me & say “wow, I could’ve had that, but I never do anything.”

I want her to be jealous of me."	Asshole	0	0
bwwe3b	2019-06-05 00:38:14	60percentathot	WIBTA If I attempted to get my superintendent fired?	So, I go to an extremely tiny IB school. For years, people leave the school and go to the bigger high school in my town. When this bigger high school was built, they had an extra wing that was supposed to be for my school. That never happened. Instead, this wing had turned into storage for chairs and tables (this is like 10 classrooms I’m talking about). I had a plan to fulfill the promise made to our school to help our rapidly dwindling numbers (there are 36 students 9th-12th total). Many teachers and parents all have wanted this to happen. However, my districts superintendent is a dick, to say the least. He threatened to shut my school down if I kept trying to make the move happen. The move would greatly benefit both schools (for our school we’d have access to electives, be able to see our friends, and be able to use desperately needed equipment. For the bigger school it would boost their education, more students would get into their first choice, and they could have access to higher advanced classes).

bwwcpv	2019-06-05 00:34:18	wordsareloaded	WIBTA if I take down a bird nest on my outside TV?	"Spend a few weekends this spring covering my deck. Went all out with lights, speakers, fan, an outside TV and a flush ceiling mounted Alexa to control it all. After all this hard work, I finally have the deck every man dreams of. 

Sitting on the deck today it’s finally nice out so I was going to take the TV cover off to put on some Rick and Marty. Before I do a bird flys out of the bottom. I look in and it seems to be a half made nest. About an hour later I decide to take it down and the bird is sitting there, staring at me with her sad little bird eyes. I could see in her bird face that just as I have built my man paradise deck, she has built the home she always wanted for her bird family. 

I don’t think there are eggs in there. But assume that there will be soon (because you know, that’s how bird nests work). Would the bird be able to make a new nest

WIBTA if I take it down? Bird family paradise? Or human backyard paradise? We can’t have both.

Update: went to take down the nest and there are indeed eggs in it. I’ve decided to let it be, those spoiled birds can watch all the Disney they want.

bwwclp	2019-06-05 00:34:00	resjudicata8	AITA for declining my FWB’s request to pay for his condoms and lubricant?	"I think my FWB is being petty but I’ll let you be the judge. 

I guess this all started last week. I texted my FWB last week asking him to share in the cost of replacing my go-to night cream because he likes to give me surprise “facials” in the middle of the night when I’m sleeping, which is erotic for him but it means I get woken up and have to wash my face and reapply. He learned it retails for around $285 USD for a standard size night cream (around 1.7 oz) at Saks and refused to pay for it. So I let it go and just sucked it up and bought myself another jar.

Then this afternoon, he venmo’d me a request for money. I asked him what it was for, and he texted back telling me it’s for his condoms and lubricant. He said since I’m the one requesting condoms on various occasions (e.g. for quickies when I don’t have time to cleanse afterwards, I want him to finish inside a condom) and since I’m the one requesting him to apply lubricant before penetrating me, I should pay for them. 

The dollar amount is not super significant, but I just feel like right now he is being petty because I asked him to share the cost of my face cream last week. Since I felt he was being petty, I declined his request. Do you think he was being petty as well or should I have paid (at least half)?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I instantly yelp and my girlfriend(who is afraid of critters as well) comes to see what im screaming at and instantly screams. 

At this point im out of commission and go to the bathroom to calm down. The pre-workout has me feeling tingles all over my body and since i saw the lizard that intensity increased times ten. 10 min pass and im still trying to convince myself that i need to do something and stop being a baby when my girlfriend says a maintenance guy is on the way. She begs me to come downstairs but i just didn’t want another man to see the condition i was in for a tiny lizard. I told her no and she had to deal with the guy downstairs by herself.

bww5la	2019-06-05 00:14:21	sharkmandibles	AITA for getting aggravated at my mom?	"Mom and I (36m)  have always had a close relationship, but she ignores me when I tell her that I'm tired of her incessant “helping”.

She's likes to solve other people’s problems. She gives advice when it wasn't asked for, or go on about options she thinks are reasonable \*if only you'd just listen to her\*. She's lost friends over it. She means well, but can’t let stuff go.

If I mention work irritation, I get weeks of job website listings (usually positions for which I'm unqualified). If I mention paying debt, I get yahoo articles ""ten ways to clear debt fast"". If we see each other it becomes a key component of conversation, and no ""hey, let’s not talk about this, hey, just stop"" helps. At best I get relief for a week or two. I don't even respond to the emails anymore. Haven't in years. Said I don't like getting advice from yahoo columns. Yet it persists.

The most consistent “suggestions” she’s given me are:

1. She really wants me to buy a house, despite me having not even 1/6th the average house price in my area in savings (and that only recently because of an inheritance from my dad's side of the family, I had no savings at all prior)
2. She wants me to ""invest"" but she's not sure in what, or how, just she's heard ""investment"" is a thing to do, which seems to me like an awesome way to get conned and make a bad financial decision.
3. She wants me to go into sculpture as a profession. I'm an illustrator part-time while working full elsewhere. I'm a good illustrator, but I got burned out with the rat race that was freelancing. I do illustration now when I want to. I'm not into sculpture (though I have some skill) and don't want to spend the money in materials/ training to get proficient in a field less marketable in the one I already minimized. \*If\* I wanted to make art work, it'd be the career I sidelined for a consistent paycheck and healthcare, not a different art career I never pursued.

These have been repeated for a decade or more, and I'm tired of rehashing them when I didn't ask for help in the first place. In fact we had a ""these are conversations I want to stop having"" talk in person not three weeks ago.

So guess what internet links and youtube videos and messages I've gotten this week?

I lost it. said ""I can't tell if you aren't hearing me, or you just don't care, but I want this to stop."" She says she loves me more than anything, she feels like she's unappreciated, she's sorry I felt that way (not sorry that she brought it up again), and only I can ""make yourself feel that way about something"" as though my feelings happen independently of the stimulus she's providing. She says maybe we should stop talking. She goes on and on like this.

And I'm just... so fucking tired. I want a relationship with my mom where, even if she can’t respect my choices, she can hear me say ""stop"" and be quiet about them. Frankly, I do want to stop talking to her.

My ex and I have a 8 year old daughter together. A few years ago he met and married someone else and had two kids with her but now they are divorced. 

My birthday is this Friday and their youngest daughter turns 1 sometime this week I can’t remember the exact day. 

They’ve only been officially divorced since January so this is the first time they are having a separate party for their kids. It’s his ex wife’s weekend with them and of course she wants my daughter to go. I didn’t mention it to my daughter because I don’t feel comfortable with her being around his ex wife and her family.

The ex wife is beyond pissed at me and calling me selfish because she’s missing her sisters party to celebrate my birthday with me.

"My fiancé’s cousin and husband were hired to be our wedding photographer 6 months ago for our wedding that is 2 months from now. They have shot many weddings previously and had a decent portfolio at a discounted family rate. After looking at the pages of the couple for a little bit I noticed they post the pictures taken at weddings on both their professional and personal (but public) accounts. Recently I checked out the husband’s facebook page and it was... very geared towards being  pro-choice. I mean many many posts about the topic. Which, I don’t mind. 
A political stance of a distant relative is something that doesn’t effect me in the grand scheme of things. 
 However, the kicker that made me choose to cancel somewhat last minute was a meme shared on the personal page of the husband that compared the amount of abortions performed by planned parenthood to that of the death toll from the holocaust. 
I felt extremely uncomfortable with having photos from my wedding being anyway associated on a page containing that kind of content and begged my fiancé to cancel. I also have a jewish bridesmaid and I feel like it would be insensitive to allow and photos with her to be associated on a page with something like that.

bwvyw9	2019-06-04 23:55:58	PineappleGetaway	AITA for cutting this person out of my life entirely and ignoring her for months?	"I was friends with this person for roughly 4 years. 

For brevity’s sake I’ll name her Ash.

At the start of the friendship, Ash had been having lots of emotional problems w her life so I’d always lend an ear or advice.

Later I started to have a lot of stress & depression so for 2 years of high school I attended an online school, leaving texting as the only contact. For our senior year of high school, I was returning & both of us were excited.

When I got back I noticed the girls were all only talking about drama. I hated it but never said anything bc I figured “They’re my friends, I don’t want to offend Ash.” It was painful. After months, I started to get quiet & uncomfortable around them. 

I have a friend related who I’ll name Josh. Josh, Ash, & I had been friends for many years. Incidents caused a rift to form between them. It got to the point where she was saying things about him like “I don’t care if anything happened to him.” Or “I never want to see him again after high school.”

Josh noticed & asked me privately if I could tell him why she was being so distant. Before this, I remember the whole group telling me to tell him his problems because I was closer. So I agreed because they gave me permission. I told him.

Ash started acting cold to me. It really fucked w me and I was already on edge so having my best friend suddenly treat me like Josh was scaring me. I went to her in a really low point, hoping for reassurance. I even said how low I was. Instead of being kind or at the min being decent about why she was upset w me she went off.

She complained about how I was so quiet all the time, about how I shouldn’t have said what I said, how I was becoming such a burden to be around.

That threw me into an extremely dark place so I stayed home and away for several days.

Fast forward & I had reached a breaking point. By now she had flat out read & ignored most of my texts, not invited me to things & the last straw was an argument.

I spent about 2 days compiling a very complete listing of things that have been troubling me lately. After I wrote it out, I texted her one morning asking if she could talk to me and it started off like this:

“What is it?”
“I just wanted to see if you were free to talk to me. It’s important.”
“Well hurry because I have plans later.”
“Okay”

In the entire discussion she would dismiss my feelings or justify her actions. This was her response when I called gossiping pointless and mean.

“I’m sorry you feel that way, but it makes us feel better.”

Also two separate times in the discussion she said “Why don’t you just got find new friends?”

After it ended I thought I wanted to stay friends but I stopped when I saw a post she made. She was w the rest of the group(I had no idea) & the caption was “Wait a minute, WHO ARE YOU?” I was done.

For months I had to see her every day & I would ignore her.

bwvyfv	2019-06-04 23:54:41	throwaway2345434567	WIBTA if I didn't allow my girlfriend to go to frat parties?	"Basically the title, the main reason isn't that I'm afraid that she's going to cheat on me, we've been together for long enough that I'm not worried about that at all.

The main reason is that she is extremely bad with alcohol and is extremely vulnerable when under the influence. Frat dudes at her school are pretty known for getting girls drunk and trying it fuck them and im really worried about her being taken advantage of. 

I'm worried about it because I recently had to transfer universities due to financial reasons and would no longer be able to go to parties with her.

WIBTA?

Edit: I don't think I made myself as clear as I should have, I don't have an issue with parties in general. It's more that a lot of the frats have a history of throwing parties to get girls drunk and basically raping them."	Asshole	0	0
bwvy8i	2019-06-04 23:54:05	checkoutguitargorge	AITA for playing my guitar at a campfire of people I didn't know?	"I am currently on a solo road trip across the country to just experience life. So far everyone I've met has been generally really cool and I've made some friends I plan on seeing again. 

I am currently at Grand Tetons and spent a lot of time out on the lake yesterday. When I got back it was pretty chilly so I saw some people about my age (early 20s) having a campfire. I got a sixer of my absolute gnarliest IPA and my guitar and walked over to say hello and hopefully make some friends. 

Everyone was cool at first and I handed out all six of my beers and got a Bud in return. I was cool with that since they were being cool. I just started lightly strumming my guitar as I was chatting with this really cool girl. She asked me if I knew ""3 little birds"" by Bob Marley so I started playing it. 

All of the sudden this dude just started making fun of me. I don't know exactly what he said but it was like ""we're all friends from Indiana University and this douche thinks he can play guitar over our conversation"" (again not exact but I know he mentioned IU  and called me a douche). The girl I was talking to said don't worry about him and asked me to keep playing so I kept playing. The guy got up and got literally in my face and said that if I didn't take my guitar and get the fuck out so he could talk with his girl friend he was going to shove it up my ass, then burn it then throw it in the lake. This time even the girl didn't stick up for me and I said that it was really lame to take my beer and not be cool. He said IPA is shit for hippies and burn outs from Oregon (good call for a dumb ass, he nailed that) and that it made me smell like shit. I got up and left and the entire group was laughing at me as I left, even the girl who asked me to play the song. I was camped a few spots over from them and I could hear them partying for a long time but they were gone before I woke up this morning. 

It was such and unnerving experience, was I the asshole there? I don't want to make that same mistake again.

I recently got a tattoo, and was showing it off to my friends he saw it and instantly got jealous. He would constantly joke about me and make fun of me behind my back. He would refuse to help me on schoolwork even though I continued to help him when he needed it. Today however, he crossed the line by saying shit about how I would never get anywhere in life cuz I had a tattoo and am really superficial, cuz the only reason girls would like me is because of my body and my looks, cuz my personality was apparently terrible(not true at all). In return I made fun of him being out of shape, and his personality being so bad girls wouldn’t even want to be in the same room as him(too much I know)and commented about his lower grades. Now we don’t have arguments like this frequently, he’s never been jealous of my being more conventionally “attractive” and more I shape than him, because it requires a lot of work, and a tattoo is just something you can pay for(I think that’s the reason it irked him) but regardless his comments were uncalled for.

One year ago, my fiance was diagnosed and beat breast cancer. In the past 2 years I've given up mostly all of my social interaction to be the man of the house. Being by her side for treatments and being the only bread winner of the house. I don't go out on weekends, or do any other type of social gatherings all to often. My most social interactions are when I go to the gym in the early morning when everyone else is sleeping. 
Cut to now:
There is a music festival this weekend that I have been planning on going to for the past 6 months. I bought my tickets well in advance and even told my fiance about (thought she claims I never told her). 
As we get closer to the fest dates, she keeps saying more and more things about me abandoning her this weekend. It's only for two nights. My plan is to leave Friday at noon and be home Sunday morning. She is acting as if I'm galavanting around the world for a month. 
I get that she had a rough year. And we've planned a family trip to the beach this summer (my idea), but I feel like I could use a little fun for myself. 
She just does not want me going plain and simple.

bwvwxf	2019-06-04 23:50:18		AITA for wanting some of my extended family at our wedding.	"Let me first preface by saying I’ve been with my fiancé for nearly 6 years and I love her to death but we’ve hit a roadblock recently while discussing our upcoming wedding. Im going to try and make this brief but it might ramble on so here goes!


When we originally planned out the wedding we wanted to have a small wedding of 65 people which allocates for 30ish each side. This worked for her because she has a small family and at the time I went along with it because I wasn’t smart enough to speak up at the time.


But the issue is that my family is significantly larger. On my dad’s side alone it would take up roughly 14 spots and on my mom’s... *oh lord my mom’s* . She grew up catholic so she has a lot of brothers and sisters and if I purely stopped at grandparents, aunts, and uncles on my mom’s side I’d be roughly at 30 leaving no room for my dad or my friends.


So then my parents said if need be they could step in and pay for the difference since my fiancé’s parents are paying for the wedding and my side of the family is larger but this she said no because that many people would make her uncomfortable. The farthest I’ve got in understanding her saying this is that (1) she overwhelmed by lots of people and (2) she doesn’t know all of them so, uncomfortable.


Now because her family is paying she has told me that I basically have no choice because I’m paying which, partially I agree because she’s paying, but also my family is offering too.

So now we’re at the point of eloping and going to some destination wedding with a small group of friends because she doesn’t want all of my family there.

I love her with all my heart and I want her to be happy but to some degree I want to be happy too and I’ve always dreamed about having a wedding with friends and family but as of now that doesn’t seem likely.


It’s my first post here so thanks to anyone who reads this and any advice would be greatly appreciated! I’m working on some homework tonight so I will try my best to respond to replies as fast as I am able!"		1	0

bwvqr9	2019-06-04 23:33:33		AITA: For telling my friend how I really feel?	"How do you know when you're too judgemental? Caroline quit her job back at the end of April.
 

She used to be a heroin addict and alcoholic. She went to residential treatment for a year then went to sober living for another year and a half. She was working when she went to sober living. She's a trust fund baby, and she lives in a studio apartment in LA. Her parents fully support her now.

She's been smoking weed most days, and I was okay with it before because she was working adequately. But now she's been saying stuff like ”oh I'm going back to school I'm gonna tour on Monday.” But hasn't visited any. She drives while high she also gets mad about anyone critical of her smoking because she says ”i was addicted to heroin I don't have a problem with weed I don't smoke when I'm upset, and I only smoke before bed.”


Now she's saying her therapist told her to ”take it easy” and she plans not to work or go to school till the end of summer. Her issues with her family are that when she was a kid, they used to do her homework or make corrections to it without her knowing. She does have some abuse issues from her brother that I know are hard. She feels a lot of anger towards her family for that.


She was asking the other day if I thought she was stupid. I told her I didn't like how much she's smoking and that she can't have gaps like that at 26 years old also because she has holes due to treatment. I said the way she was acting is stupid because if she wants to work through her issues or have a career, she needs to be clear-headed and getting stuff done.

She got mad and defensive, saying she only smokes before bed and ”thanks for confirming what my family thinks of me.”

Now she seems mad at me and isn't talking to me, but idk if I'm too judgemental, I don't know how to come across as concerned because I'm concerned for her.

bwvpqz	2019-06-04 23:30:55	Doommakerguy	WIBTA For refusing to go to a different state with my parents when I graduate?	"For context, we are poor. This is important later on.

My school district provides enough money to pay the fees and tuition (excluding books) to an associate's degree at a local community college. my mother is convinced that the offer applies to any college in the u.s. when it states in the school district's website that it only applies to a certain college.
My parents are incapable of supporting anything above a minimum wage job as a result of their lack of postsecondary education along with my father's disability from work and my mother's alcohol addiction which has cost her countless job losses.
The house they wish to live in is what is my soon-to-be deceased grandmother's house in a different state across the country. My parents always brag about how nice the house is and it seemed to be nice when I went there once. 

The reasons I want to stay consist 

1. Free education because we're poor

2. Family lives here (many uncles and cousins, some of which are in the industry I want to work in when I'm out of school)

3. I'm in a really happy relationship, which my father dismissed with the statement that ""There's other pieces of ass out in ___""

4. I'd be supporting them.

5. My parents aren't very pleasant, they refer to me as degrading shit when they have me do chores or tasks.

TLDR;
I don't want to move to a different state because of free school, family, my girlfriend, and the fact that my parents are jerks

bwvoo2	2019-06-04 23:28:05	airbnbmadness	AITA for not paying extra $20 cleaning fee for crazy airbnb host who insists we were worst guests ever (no we’re not)	"A while ago, my friend and I stayed at an airbnb. After check out, we later received a message from the Airbnb host saying that her cleaner was at the apartment and said we were the “worst guests ever.” Said we left garbage everywhere, dishes left out, surprised by the mess. She said her cleaner is charging extra time for cleaning, and she would charge us the cleaner’s extra fee.

We were shocked by her accusation and asked for more info. These are our sins:
* Cleaner said we left the dishes out. True, but we had washed the plates before we left and laid them out to dry next to the sink. They were not dirty, just wet. Somehow, the cleaner mistakenly thought they were dirty or maybe expected us to dry them and put them back in the cabinet. 

* Cleaner said we left garbage everywhere. Untrue. We had combined all our trash into one giant trash bag in the kitchen for the cleaner to see. Our sin was that had not taken out the trash in the Building Trash Receptacle Room

* Cleaner said the bathroom was stained. We asked for photos. The cleaner took a photo that showed a bathroom floor with some hairs on the floor and a towel on the floor (we put it out for when we stepped out of shower). 

The airbnb host said her rule was that we leave the house as tidy and clean as when we arrived. And we had violated that rule with the dishes, trash, and bathroom situation.

I read the rules again. We were paying a cleaning fee. Nowhere does it say we were supposed to take out the trash. 

AITA I told her that her and the cleaner’s request did not make sense, and we would not be paying extra cleaning fee. Our dishes were left clean. Her rules never told us to take out the trash and we had in fact already thought we were being responsible by putting everything in one specific trash bag for the cleaner to see. The condition we left the house (hairs on wet bathroom floor) and wet clean dishes not dried and stored — these all seem like normal level things that should be covered under a cleaning fee. We didn’t do anything extra weird that warranted an extra cleaning fee. 

Her instructions that her apartment should have been left as ‘clean as when we arrived’ seem unclear, especially since we were already paying a cleaning fee. Did she want us to mop the bathroom floors? What exactly did the cleaning fee cover then?

I told her if she had expectations we were to take out the trash and other specific things, she should have clearly written these out all in the Airbnb listing."	Not enough info	0	0

bwvo5v	2019-06-04 23:26:47		WIBTA If I made a complaint about an old swimming coach who currently works as child liaison officer?	"pretty much from the ages of 10-14 I had a swim coach who tormented me, he would berate me in front of the other kids, frequent emotional outbursts, sly digs,always placing me at the end of the que even though i was usually the fastest etc ,without going into too much detail it was awful , i cried after most sessions would hid my gear/ rip my togs just so i could avoid training often other kids would be like why does he hate you so much? he also had favourites and would make them out to be superior,  creating a divide between the team.  I went from being the best to not even contending in regattas his power infiltrated into my sports life my school life family everywhere i went he was there. 

my parents did know to some degree about this, I often complained about him and they supported me and stood in whenever they witnessed anything and eventually they insisted about making a formal complaint and we did and coach was discreetly let go and disappeared from my life at that point the damage was done and I gave up swimming a year or so later.  

Swimming went from my all out favourite activity to I haven’t been in a pool in years.  Thats barely the tip of the iceberg of it all but keeping it short I recently found out he now works as a child liaison officer and I am just gobsmacked this adult who put time and effort into destroying a child is now responsible for ensuring children’s safe and well being. it just doesn’t sit right with me, currently i work as a teacher and no child has ever left my class feeling worse than when they went in. I’m not hung up on him in anyway, havent thought about him in years and it has been 10 years since this all went down so WIBTA  if i made a serious complaint to ensure he never works with kids again

note. if i went around and messaged some old friends of mine and their parents they would be able to back up my statement. 

note 2. Will admit I was a bit of a messer and chatty but i responded and behaved when i got given out to and knew boundaries or at least rarely step over them"		1	0

bwvnyl	2019-06-04 23:26:14		AITA for having a list of our property for division ready for a breakup	"Throwaway obviously. 

I (25F) called off my engagement with my fiancee (24F) today. We've been together nearly 3 years, engaged for about 8 months and we of course live together. The reason for the breakup isn't important. 

I had been feeling that this was coming for some time, and decided that before I did it I wanted to gather my thoughts properly. We're both grad students so live on a very tight budget, so the logistics of a breakup would be hellish without any prep I thought. 

I wrote a breakup letter (which I gave her, and talked to her about) which allowed me to lay out all my thoughts, feelings, and reasons. Some hours later, she said we then had to talk about the apartment. This is when I presented a list I had prepared. The list detailed all of her things (that I had no claim to, so we had no reason to discuss them), all the things we purchased together, all the things we were given (through her - by her friends or family) and vice versa. 

Obviously the points of contention would be the things we purchased together, or things we were given together (which includes things like a fridge, and our dining table). I had included a statement that she has first claim to anything she wants, as a sort of apology for what I've done, but that if she didn't necessarily want it, I would pay her for each item. I had made a sort of tallied list of costs (her half of things we paid for together, or approx. sums for things like the fridge). This was intended to make the process of dividing property easier, and also to help her replace things when she moved on, or maybe even just make it easier I guess for her?? 

But at this point she became distraught. She was already in a bad state because of the breakup, I understand that, but she leaped to a new level at being presented this list. She called me cold, conniving, like I had planned all this out (I mean, I admit that?) and it was cruel to just present this to her. She called me an asshole, and stormed out to go to her sisters house. 

Am I the asshole here? I'm sort of confused. I agree that I'm the asshole in the breakup - I came to her when she thought things were peachy and broke her heart. But I felt that this list of property would be helpful and ultimately *less* of an asshole thing to do..

Edit:

Everyone seems to think that the reason for the breakup is relevant, so I guess I'll include that. We haven't had sex in over a year, and prior to that maybe once every 3-4 months. We have seen couple's counselors and therapists (individually and together), she has seen doctors, OBGYN's, and we've talked about it at length. Nothing has changed. We're simply different people, with different wants and needs. She also decided, without discussing it with me, to accept a job post-degree out of state, and told me we'd be moving. My career would be ended by moving to this area, and also we had been working on an agreed plan for over 2 years for what we were doing after (the job she accepted is the same as the job she had planned here, just location and about 5% pay difference). I have been thinking about it a little lately as I have found a change in my personality and attitude; it's been weighing on me, and I've been evaluating whether I think I have anything left in me to work on it. I don't agree with the sentiment in some responses that all break-ups are instantaneous, spontaneous actions and that having thought about the break-up prior is somehow wrong. It had been weighing on my mind, I came to the conclusion I don't think we had a future, I made the decision to write the letter and then write the list the morning of the breakup. 

I agree wholly timing was bad, and I agree it can be seen as insensitive. But the comments about sociopathy and working on my relationship I think are uncalled for. I tried to do something to help the process, so it wasn't weeks of awkward toiling and arguing."	Asshole	0	0
bwvntc	2019-06-04 23:25:49		AITA that I don't want our new roommates bf using our washroom	"My partner and I have a house - and we recently found a roommate from a mutual friend. Our new roommie was desperate for a new place, and when they seen ours - they fell in love and wanted to move in asap. There are no issues personally with our new roommate - but a few things about have been kind of starting to bother me and my partner (doesn't clean and when asked to help out (it takes having to ask 5-8 times.., doesn't clean up after themselves, ). Generally speaking, we are wanted someone that was respectful, quiet, relatively clean, creative and able to pay on time. The first week they moved in, their (unsure of what to call it because our roommate stated they weren't in a relationship) ""boyfriend, ex?"" stayed over. Fine, not a problem. However its been over 4 months now and our roommates 'bf' has been coming over 3-4 times a week. He never says hi, or bothers to greet us and 99% of the time myself and my partner have NO idea they are even in our house.. This person enters our home and we never know!

As a woman, I find it eerie and uncomfortable to have another male that I don't know in our house, using our amenities, even went as far as to use our washroom that is private and not for use for guests... Anytime we leave for a trip we come back to the house untidy..

We tried talking to our new roommate but my partner who doesn't really have strong boundaries (he's a people pleaser, really lovely and kind, but he has had issues in the past of people taking advantage of his kindness) is bothered but doesn't want to really 'confront' the situation. I think we should lay down the boundaries, and rules as this was initially our house - we pay more rent, we clean, cook more, and we never agreed to having their 'bf/fling' over more than 1-2 times a week (sleep over), using our space, doesn't bother to greet, introduce or let us know he's' in our house but why does he feel entitled to use features that we are entitled to as we LIVE here? Something about this person just rubs me the wrong way and I can't put my finger on it..

Is it ok to ask our roommate to stop inviting or cut back on having this person around? They leave their garbage/trash around (like i said, they dont clean up after themselves, use our wifi, amenities, have absolutely no idea who they are) we have been uncomfortable since....

I mod a certain subreddit, I was hired as they needed more of them. Now the senior mods have this kid that about a year ago did some questionable things on their discord and subreddit. I have a big heart and want to help the kid by helping him understand what he did and why it was wrong so he could come back. But the senior mods were all ""no contact with this person."" I understood them... But considering it was an order I disagreed with... I elected to ignore it. So I talked to him, and he did admit that he did some bad things, but that was over a year ago and he's just been trying to come back because he's a huge fan of the subreddits topic and community (they also blacklisted him from every other subreddit that shared the topic). He said that he was trying to be a better person, and I truly believe him. But the senior mods are stubborn. ""I dealt with him for over a year... You didn't."" Maybe so... But they put a ban on anyone trying to listen to him.

Maybe I'm being lied to by someone here. I don't know. It's the internet, and everyone on reddit is a bot. Not really but you get what i mean. I'm honestly afraid to post this because this is a popular sub and if one of the mods happen to see it... Bye bye mod status. But I just wanted to be a good person... I just wanted to help the guy that was dealt a bad hand. Does that make me an asshole? Is it being an asshole to go against a direct order from a superior because you don't agree with it? Because it damns the little guy? They kept saying he wasn't worth it. I don't see life like that. He didn't commit an atrocity like murder, he just said some bad things. He has been banned for over a year now of a lifetime ban. I'm honestly afraid... to help someone.

"My buddy (we'll call him Steve) and I have known each other for a couple years now, have helped each other through some tough times and been there for each other. Grown together through hanging out and playing a spot together quite a bit. About a year ago he invited a ""Friend girl"" of his to start hanging around us. At the time she was in a long term relationship, and he went on to confide in me about how he had known her since middle School and they were somewhat close. He had always been fond of her, but she had been in a relationship and she had also told him that she didn't see him that way. 

Fast forward to now...

She and her long term BF broke up about 6 months ago, obviously causing a glimmer of hope in Steves eyes thinking that this was his chance. Again, he was open with me about this and I listened. He started being super flirty with Gabby and she admitted to being uncomfortable, enough to the point of telling him (again) that she didn't see him that way and to just be cool. So he agreed, but still with a lingering hope. 

And now for the prestige...

Gabby and I started to hang out...a lot. It just came naturally. We got along extremely well, communication was easy and our interests almost the same. We didn't say anything right off to Steve because we didn't really know what direction we were going. So why start a convo before there's something to talk about? At that time we were just friends hanging out. However now Steve has OBVIOUSLY realized that Gabby and I have gotten closer, so he has separated himself from both of us quite a bit.

I have grown up with a bipolar mother and I have always had trouble trusting people. I’m always afraid that my friends are not really my friends and that they are just trying to get away from me even though they are saying that they like me.  A couple of weeks ago I had a breakdown and asked my boyfriend to tell me all the things I did wrong when I was social so I could learn. Which he did I was happy for, but he has kept on doing it ever since every time I’m social.

Today I had a friend over for the first time in forever and it was the first time I was with that friend just the two of us. I live with my boyfriend  so obviously he was there as well, but not really with us. My friend and I talked a lot and I had a great time. I really felt that we clicked, but the first thing my boyfriend points out when she walks out is what social mistakes I made with her. I got really pissed at him because he knows that I am so afraid of getting new friends and that I’m really insecure and I called him a bitch for pointing out all the mistakes I did. I should have put it better but I was kind of broken because I thought that this was really successful and the first great social experience in a month. I really really thought I did I great, but still he had things to point out and pointed out subjects I should avoid next time. He said that he was so angry because I was pissed and that he only wanted to help me and that he thought I wanted advice on not to be socially awkward.

After cleaning around a bit, I started to get a nasty headache, largely from the amount of stress I had yesterday, so I decided to lay down to take a nap. My mother decided to pester me about not getting enough sleep and how I ""shouldn't stay up so late on that phone"" while I was trying to sleep.

My mother tells me to ""just take some pills if your head hurts"" and I, rather stupidly and still hazy from half-sleep, ask if it usually helps with her own pressure-based headaches. Instead of answering me, she got defensive and then snatched my phone.

Me, being pissed, went to take my phone back because I got sick of this bullshit she pulls, but she just tries to push me away and """"""playfully"""""" says ""go back to sleep, you don't need more distractions!"" and hands the phone to my dad.

My dad says ""Your mom is the one who took your phone, so she's the one who'll give it back to you."" as if I was still a goddamn teenager. I was fuming at this point, so I popped a couple of painkillers and took my phone back. My dad was pissed and demanded that I give my phone back. I refused and lashed out against him saying that this was between me and my mom who shouldn't have shoved him into this. He tells me I'm behaving like a brat and I just leave the bare phone case there out of spite.

They both refuse to talk to me. AITA?

"I was talking about people who throw ""you are not my child"" at their children (grow or not) faces are fucked up. I'm super attached to my parents, but I don't think I could have a come back from something like this. He was kind of agreeing with me until he recollected that his mother said that to his sister.  


For context: My SIL is a full-fledged jerk. She has done some pretty fucked up shit. I told him ""well, your sister is another level"" but I was referring to the last few years when she 1) ""disowned"" my MIL because she stopped giving her money 2) right after that she left home, but left her kid under 2yo behind 3) once she remarried she ""abducted"" the child from school (my niece was about 5 or 6) and that is how she started to raise the child again 4) in the last 4 years she calls my MIL mother WHEN there is something in it for her (as in she wants something).   
ALSO: DH and SIL are adopted. 

&#x200B;

But husband said they used to say ""you are not my daughter/ you are not my mother"" to each other when she was a teen. Now that, in my book, is a pretty fucked up thing to do.  Especially the mother.  Dude, I would never dream to say that to my mom as a kid, teen or whatever.   


My family is pretty much just yes, I'm pretty lucky. I have a close relationship with them, we are very respectful towards it other, etc. So when he says ""it's normal to say ""yo are not my child"" after he recollect that his mom used to do that, and after state it was during SIL teens, I tell him ""well, this was pretty fucked up thing to do"".   


Like, dude, their relationship spiraled, and SIL is a jerk, but if my mom said to me ""you are not my kid"" in an argument... that would have hurt me DEEEEEPLY. And in later teens or as an adult, I do not know if I would be able to really have a relationship after hearing something like that. As in... don't say something THAT SERIOUS if you really don't mean it.   


I didnt said ""your mother is a shit mother"" (but she sometimes can be just no) but that it was fucked up. And it was WRONG.   


And than we start to argue. Like, it's being two years we are talking about being parents, and when he said ""there is NORMAL people and there is Pollyannas like your family"" I got deadly serious. ""I don't consider this NORMAL"". And them he tried to used WAY fucked up stuff like siblings robbing each other, assault, etc to say ""this is fucked up"".  And if something was serious, it was ""NORMAL"" to say ""you are not my kid"".   


So, I pretty much said ""You better not be a normal parent by your standards. If we have a kid and you say something like that, I'm divorcing and you will need to fight for your right in court"".   


He didn't said anything about this, just repeated that my family is not ""like everybody else"" and we are pollyannas.

Also this might be long so I apologize.

So this happened about an hour ago. I'm currently at my grandmas house with my big cousin cade. Grandma (G) tells us we should go outside as it's a nice day. I say ok and grab my football. I ask my cousin If he would like to play. While older than me he is slower and has less experience in football than me. We do rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets the ball and I win. Be tried to defend but I'm too fast for him. About 10 min in the score is 28-0 me in the lead. Then he gets the ball and goes and doesnt go anywhere. I tell him this and he denies it saying he got a foot. We argue until he pushes me towards his touchdown suddenly. We were playing 2 hand touch because its muddy in the yard. I clearly had both hands on him and he proceeds to push and then spin me off and go for the score. I tell him he was down and he gets mad and goes in the house with my football. I got this football from Arkansas(I'm Texan) And it has the little cowboys logo on it. I cant really get another one for a little while so I protect it. About 30 minutes ago he comes back out and my football is popped. Literally popped. I of course am FREAKING OUT and storm back in the house and lock the door behind me in my room.

bwvijd	2019-06-04 23:11:48	aLostGusher	AITA for dismissing people when they ask how tall I am?	"I am 6'7""-6'8"", and it occasionally gets me unwanted attention. People frequently ask how tall I am, which I am perfectly happy to answer in normal conversation. It usually leads to sports talk, which I am more than comfortable in because I played sports and follow quite a few pretty closely. However, I feel that sometimes my privacy/personal space gets invaded with people asking me, and I will dismiss the question. This includes people interrupting phone calls, tapping me on the shoulder when I have headphones on, walking down the street having conversations with other people, but also times where I'm simply existing and can see them staring at me while they think about asking. Usually these people have the same follow-up questions: Basketball? Parent Height? Sibling Height? My sister's roommate's whatever is 6'2"".

&#x200B;

I completely understand the curiosity, I do. When I see a person my height, I wonder the exact same thing. Did he/she play a sport? At what level? How good would they be at my sport? So that part isn't lost on me. I choose not ask any questions not because I think it would be an asshole move (I really don't know, that's why I'm making this post) but because I know they get asked all the time, more than most people would guess. And besides, if we're at the same event, someone is probably going to introduce us to each other as the tall people anyways. 

&#x200B;

So, when I get the question while I feel like I'm doing something that didn't need to be interrupted, I will frequently not answer and continue to walk/speak to whomever I was speaking with. It gets dicey with the headphones because it's a little more pointed to just put them back in, I usually just suck it up and answer those. AITA for dismissing these people?"	No A-holes here	0	0

He was manner-less and embarrassing (over-staying welcomes,  forcing people to stop and talk to him even though it's obvious that they're late, speaking ultra loud in public, total disregard for any sort of rules or authority, horrific table manners.. etc.). For the most part it felt like going out with a 9 year old who hasn't really figured it out yet. While I was with him, I got him to really improve quite a bit.

However his brother was all of those things multiplied by a thousand. I swear the brother's presence was like nails on a chalkboard, yet it was none of my business. He wasn't the one I was dating. So for as long as I was with my ex, I tolerated his brother with every inch of my being and never said a word.These guys barely ever went anywhere without the other, so I had to hang out with him a lot. If the brother was there, I rarely enjoyed it. Unfortunately, he grew quite fond of me (even though I never gave him a reason to, other than just being generally polite.)
It's been 5 months since the break up, and every month my ex's brother has texted/called me asking to hang. If I don't pick up, it doesn't matter. He will call again later. Out of courtesy I do pick up most of the time and I give out weak ass excuses. I just want him to take the hint and leave me alone.

bwvh7g	2019-06-04 23:08:14		AITA for trying to keep my relationship secret from my friends?	"As a little bit of background, I live in a duplex and I am one of 5 guys in the bottom unit and there are 5 girls in the top unit. Around November 2018 I started hooking up with one of the girls (Lets call her Z) and was very explicit that I wasn’t looking for a relationship at the time and she agreed, it was just a booty call type of relationship. After getting to know her a little better I decided I didn’t want to keep hooking up with her, and I later found out that she had sex with my roommate on my bed (another story for another day) so we don’t talk much anymore. 

The 10 of us all started hanging out more and I began to really like one of the girls (lets call her S), and eventually she made a move and we started hooking up. We talked about what we wanted to get out of this and since we both liked each other we just wanted to see where things went. We didn’t want anybody else involved in our relationship so it could develop naturally so we decided to try and keep it a secret. 

We weren’t very good at keeping it a secret, and when our housemates began to suspect something we ended up telling them, except we didn’t want to tell Z as we know from previous events that she has a habit of trying to cause drama in relationships. 

Well of course, Z found out. She has declined to talk to any of us about it, but is very upset about the whole situation. It is understandable that she isn’t excited to see us together, but she has gone so far as to try and personally exclude me from events that all 10 of us were going to attend. 

Some of S’s other housemates are upset that we lied to them at first about our relationship, however I feel like my relationship with S is none of their business, although I can understand them wanting honesty. 

As far as things go with Z, I think that although we had already stopped talking before she had sex with my roommate on my bed, if she wanted respect and honesty from me she shouldnt have left a legitimate biohazard on my bed (they didnt clean up or change the sheets, I didnt noticed and washed my sheets a week or two later as usual) and lied to me about it (when I found out my bed was used she said she was locked out of her house and had to spend the night). 

So AITA for not telling my friends about our relationship when I first started? And was it wrong to start this whole relationship even when Z and I had completely stopped talking and even expressed that what we had was nothing more than a hookup? I understand I may not have gone about everything in an ideal way but was I an asshole?

PUPDATE: after all of your guys lovely feedback I’m confident once again that I’m not in the wrong here. When the husband came home from work I laid down the law with him and the younger hims and am proud to announce that no one (not even the husband) will be re-homed.

Second pupdate: you guys I’m not a bad dog mom. My dog has toys to chew on. My dog isn’t left unsupervised all day long with free reign of the house. I promise you the issue is the level of energy in addition to his breed. He’s a lab/collie mix. He just hit 8 months so his puppy teeth are all gone! 

Things you need to know before we delve into the fine details of this nonsense: 
My husband is a cat person, and I am a dog person. Up until recently we’ve only rented and so we got a cat because they were allowed. My husband decided our cat was “lonely” and that she absolutely needed a cat friend. So now we’re two cats in. I help take care of them, do vet appointments, litter box and everything else. 

We bought a house and had a baby, but my husband tells me I can finally get a dog because we have a yard. My husband brings home a THIRD cat as a rescue without consultation. We end up re-homing it a few months later because it is causing absolute havoc (peeing on the baby’s things and does not get along with the existing cats at all). 
During this time I’ve been scouring for a dog that I think would fit in with our family. I’ve always had rescues growing up but since we needed to ensure the dog would get along with the cats and kiddos we decide it would be best to get a puppy. 
Okay background done. Good? Good.

I HAVE HAD PUPPIES BEFORE AND I KNOW HOW MUCH WORK THEY ENTAIL -my husband however, does not. I have spent so much time and energy training our pup. He is crate trained, he knows his basic commands, he gets played with. He’s a good boy. The problem is that our dog likes to chew things (he’s a puppy after all). My husband and kids cannot for the life of them figure out that if they want their things to be safe to put them where the dog can’t get them. 
I don’t see this as a problem and figured I would just play with the dog more to get that puppy energy down. My husband just starts complaining non-stop about how the dog is destroying everything (almost all of which is his and the kids stuff). He’s chewed through extension cords left outside, things placed up against his crate, and other things left behind that shouldn’t be there in the first place. My husband refuses to help play or walk the dog but has threatened to put him up on Craigslist multiple times and has recently asked a coworker if they wanted him. All that gets talked about now is how terrible my dog is and the kids have followed suite.

"My girlfriend of 1 year(live together now for a month and been together nearly every day before that) the other day asked to look at my phone half jokingly but serious. I said fine but only if i can look at yours too. Agreed.
Long story short I found a handful of facetimes on whatsapp (an we both commonly use) to a male friend of hers.
Him: my girlfriend is from latin american and moved here for work 3 years ago. He was the interviewer and did the onboard process at her first company here. (They are similar age and both from latin america) they worked together one year before she took another job.
Now ive been aware of there texting (in Spanish) for the extent of our relationship and I use aware purposefully because Ive never done more then ask who he was once blah blah blah, but remained aware. These texting is borderline daily at an average rate of 4/7 days a week I would say. Excessive I think but I said nothing until now that ive seen face times at 30 minute lengths and phone calls at 30 minute lengths on top of it also. Conveniently didnot know this was happening. And noticed dates on some when I was away, others just at my place, non happened that i was aware of. (I also cant understand 70% of spanish words so the texts are meaningless)
So I say to her “i think this is inappropriate that you are talking to another male this much and I dont like it.” She follows with she sees it differently and that they are good friends. I respond with “If it was me talking to a women this much you would have a major problem” (this is true she would lose it) she says thats only because I do t believe a male and female friendship can work (somewhat true but Im more of skeptical in many cases).
Mind this, he lives a couple thousand miles away now but has traveled to town apparently (found this out during our conversation) ive never met him, increasing the reason why i think its inappropriate.
Any ways I think its excessive, she doesn’t talk to anyone beside me and her direct family this much. Ive honestly never talked to anyone beside a SO that much. Its a lot coupled with the calls and facetimes on top, they new each other through work for 1 year. Its now 2 years later. —-this is why i cant fully wrap my head around this.

I was off work, and had been trying to catch up on housework. I had been washing laundry, and cleaning the bathrooms in our house. When my husband got home from work(I gave him sometime to relax before asking), I asked him if he could help out with putting away the laundry while I wash and dry them. I even mentioned that I would wash and put away the dishes if he helped put up the laundry. 

He said, “No, I’m not going to put away the laundry since you didn’t do it last time. You just left the laundry in the baskets.”

I replied, “I put away some of the laundry, but I couldn’t put away all of it since you dumped all the clean laundry into the floor. I’ve been rewashing the laundry since the dog laid all over them.”

“I didn’t put the clean laundry into the floor.”

“Okay, fine. I’ll put up all the laundry.” And I left it at that.

bwuwme	2019-06-04 22:15:39	camsanityy	AITA for being upset that my sisters husband yelled at me?	"Back story, my sister is 19, her husband is 20, they got married in November. They live with my mom, my boyfriend and I had to move in as well with my mom this year as we had some financial issues. (I'm 24, he's 22)

I never had any problems with her husband, he's usually nice and I had never had any issue living with him. Recently I've noticed he hasn't been being very nice to my sister. He's very hot-headed. Two weeks ago when it was the 4 of us home for the weekend, we were hanging out and my sister lost something and we all began looking for it, shouting to each other in other rooms about where it could be, etc. He, from his room, screamed at all of us ""Shut up, Damnit!"" and slammed his door. My sister got upset and talked to him and they had a fight. Neither of them apologized. The past two weeks, I let it go but my boyfriend has been really upset by it because he feels we shouldn't be yelled at like that. We told my mom but kept quiet about it other than that.

So on Sunday, we received the dog we are pet-sitting for the summer, he clashed with my dogs and they were fighting a bit. I got mad because my sisters husband at one point pushed one of my dogs heads to the ground and pinched the skin on the back of his neck, making him cry. No one said anything and I was afraid to say something because my sister and I were already fighting. I mentioned it to my mom and she didn't like it either, but no one said anything to them at the time.

Now on Monday my boyfriend and I had the day off work so we could help the dogs acclimate and my sister and her husband were home as well. I got into a fight with my sister about the way they were treating the dogs and her husband pointed his hand at me and screamed ""Cut it out, Damnit!!!"" I was angry and said ""Are you talking to me that way?"" and he says ""Yes, I am talking to you."" in a VERY rude manner, still pointing his hand at me. I was extremely upset that he not only yelled at me, but cursed at me too. I told him to never talk like that to me in my own house. My boyfriend got upset too and told him ""do not talk to my girlfriend like that ever again. I don't talk to your wife that way."" He said he wouldn't do it again. My sister didn't say anything to him, and I told my mom and she was extremely upset with the situation and called my sister to tell her what he did wasn't right and my sister just stuck up for him and said I deserved it and they're just gonna move out because no one likes them. I didn't want it to go that far, I love my sister and I expected her to stand up for me.. Because I would stand up for her if my boyfriend ever did that. Family is family. I feel it wasn't right that her husband came between and yelled and cursed at me. I got into a huge fight with my sister and she basically blew up on me and blamed it all on me. She said her husband is more important and she should back him up.

bwuwhj	2019-06-04 22:15:19		AITA for not visiting my uncle in his deathbed?	"Four weeks ago my 63 yo uncle (my fathers older brother) was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Things didnt looked good to begin with. Between then and today I had visited him only once (2 weeks ago), but when I did, he couldnt remember my name (maybe because of the tumor) and you could see he wasnt ok. I was the last of my family to visit him, mainly because I had exams that week but the fact I wasnt keen on doing so seemed to affect my father. It looked as if he thought I was heartless and didnt care about him.

Truth is, throughout my life I barely ever see him, only on christmas and some special occasions like family meetings (mainly birthdays). I do care about him, but I feel as if I am forced to love him more than I do just because he is a family member.

Today, after his first chemotherapy session, he had a brain hemorrage so the doctors had to induce him into a coma. He wont recover. My father called and told my mother, who told me and asked me if I wanted to come with her to the hospital to say ""the last goodbye"". Put shortly, I refused, since I thought it would be pointless (since my uncle cant hear me) and I didnt want to be standing in the hospital room for hours ankwardly pretending to be more sad than I really am.

Now I fear my parents think im a heartless asshole for not going (which im starting to think too), when in reality, I just want to mourn him in my own way. I know it meant a lot for my father if I went but really I feel like im being forced to do so. AITA for not going to his deathbed?"	No A-holes here	1	0

bwuwbh	2019-06-04 22:14:51	tellmewhygus	AITA for being fed up with my wife's best friend?	"My wife has a close friend that I have been able to tolerate because our interactions are infrequent and short. Before I get to my recent issue, I want to explain what being around her is like:

* She has an opinion about everything, and it is ALWAYS negative.
* She commutes 2 hours (one way) to work, and that is everybody else's fault.
* Her relationships fail because she does not communicate and that has resulted in an opinion that men are idiots incapable of growing up.
* She does not want children so nobody else can be happy or excited about pregnancies.
* She has severe anxiety (parallel parking set her into a panic attack) and refuses to take medication, instead medicating with weed. I don't mind weed, but she needs some professional help.

It is exhausting. My wife is often on the receiving end of her rants, and it has started to take a toll on her. She ends up venting to me. Recently, we found out two friends are expecting. Great, right? Not to the friend. Now she is mad that ""this year is ALL about babies and last year was ALL about weddings!"" 

I got married last year. She was a major part of it.

It got to the point that I told my wife I cannot be around her anymore if she cannot get her attitude under control. The friend excuses her attitude by saying she is just ""blunt and honest"". I told some friends that you can be blunt and honest and still be an asshole. They said I am overreacting and being the actual asshole here. Am I?"		0	0

bwuuy2	2019-06-04 22:11:28	InfamousFeedback	AITA for kicking out my 21-year old son because I caught him smoking weed?	"The first time I caught my son smoking weed when he was 18. A cop brought him home because he was caught with his friends smoking near their high school. The officer was VERY lenient because my son had 0.5 grams of marijuana on him and he could’ve been charged with disorderly conduct and marijuana possession involving a minor which is a felony with an average of a 5-20 year prison sentence.

Instead, they confiscated it and brought him home to my place. He told us to ensure this doesn’t happen again, and he’s informally “sentenced” him to 300 hours of community service for the summer. I thanked him for his kindness and grounded my son for the rest of the summer and forced him to do the community service.

I took away his phone, TV, and all of his electronics, and gave an opportunity to earn back 1 week of freedom in exchange for 1 page about the harmful effects of marijuana on brain development, the possible prison sentences for what he’s doing, incarceration rates of black people and how **real** that reality is (goes without saying we’re black), how it’s a gateway drug and what that means, etc. He did that for 8 pages, so his 3 month punishment became a month.

I told him I never wanted to have this conversation again and until marijuana is legalized, he will NOT be bringing that to my house and risk ME ruining my livelihood. Nor will I allow him risking himself, at least on my watch. He can live with his mother who lives in Colorado if he wants to do that (my son doesn’t think college is for him so he makes $15 an hour working at UPS. We don’t charge him rent, and we demand in exchange for free rent, he saves 2/3rds his money so he can have a nice cushion of at least \~80K in 5 years before he moves out on his own.

Well I caught him smoking again earlier today. I told him I wasn’t having this conversation and that he has 30 days to pack and be at his mom’s house, or to pay for his own apartment. He’s begging for another chance but I already gave him and I made myself clear. If he still wants free rent, he can live with his mom. He doesn’t really want to do that because he’s dating someone. I told him it’s not my problem and will serve him an eviction notice soon.

I’m know I’m being tough, but I rather my son hate me as a free man than love me enabling him behind bars. I still feel horrible about myself; am I being an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

However, he has Sirius Radio in the office and it’s always set to a 60s/70s rock station, which in my opinion is terrible. And it’s pretty loud - louder than just background office music. Just now, in the waiting room I am being subjected to the Grateful Dead, the Moody Blues and some band called Procol Harum, which is awful. I know it sounds petty, but I already hate going to the dentist and this music makes the experience worse. Sure, every once in a while there’s a good tune by Elton John or Queen but it’s mostly music that makes me want to hurl.

bwushx	2019-06-04 22:05:40	spaghettiChong2	WIBTA if I exclude my moms from my daughter’s kindergarten graduation next year?	"Leaving a lot out of because of word count.

I’ve done a TON of personal growth recently,  I feel like a completely different person. I’ve finally gotten my depression under control, and things are going really well for me.

I think it’s time to cut my mom off. She was never there for me. She had me and one of my brothers every other weekend, but we spent many over nights at a babysitters. She dropped me off at grandmas in a diff. state when I was 10. She gave me two pieces of gum: one for the plane ride over, and one for back in a few months. I saved that 2nd piece of gum in my powerpuff girls backpack. After a year, I ate that fucking gum and I cried. 

Then 8 years filled with empty promises of visits. Every single thing she “sent” me “got lost” in the mail. Not to mention she said she said never got child support; which I found out was a lie. 

My daughter tested into early kindergarten. I told my mom weeks ago I didn’t want to talk to her, but she’s never been told “no.” She started freaking out and calling me, threatening to drive to my state, pick me and my daughter up. I told her I’d talk to her when I was ready and needed space. She proceeded to continue to message me over the next few weeks. I stayed no contact, until I finally told her I’d call her later. That was mistake #1. She bombarded me with more messages asking me to call constantly. I went no contact for another week or so, then finally gave in and called her yesterday. That was mistake #2. She proceeded to make the same empty promises to my daughter that she made to me, reaffirming my decision to go no contact. I mentioned my daughter was starting school, She asked me when and where and what she needed. I told her it was a school around where I used I live, but gave her no information beyond that. I told her she didn’t need anything because we were taking care of it. She always tries to insert herself and be the third parent when she wasn’t even a first parent to me,  and she constantly tries to undermine my ex, or make dads out to be unnecessary.

Next year in May, my baby will be having her kinder grad, and I’m extremely inclined to not mention/invite her. I don’t want her to play grandma of the year, she’s not even grandma of the week. She made a scene at her bday party because she let her open a present and I got upset. It was the first time we ever threw her a bday party and I spent months planning it, only for her to steal that special moment of opening her first bday party present. She said there will be other bday parties and I can have those.

It makes me not want to share ANY moments with her.  I feel bad for causing her to miss that moment because it’s only going to happen once, but I don’t feel she deserves to be there. I feel like I have to hide my life, I can’t post pictures. If she finds out I excluded her, she’s going to ruin that moment because the only thing I’m going to associate with it is the guilt trip I’ll get."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwuse1	2019-06-04 22:05:27	ktitten	WIBTA if I excluded one friend from a roadtrip?	"So all my friends are 18 and we have this summer practically free before we go to university. I thought it would be a great idea to go on some kind of roadtrip, I've always dreamed of it, especially with these friends. We are a pretty tight knit group but we only see eachother as a group maybe once every month, not much recently because we have all been busy with exams.


We are from England so I was thinking maybe Ireland or just somewhere else in the UK. I ask the group chat 'hey, anyone wanna go on a roadtrip this summer?' and one of my friends replies how she doesn't want to go far, doesn't like long car journeys and we could maybe just go for a day out to a city nearby. Completely different idea to mine, but ok, we can do that at some point for sure! 


I still really want to go on this road trip though. I know my other friends in the group love the idea, I've bought it up with them casually a few times. But the girl that doesn't want to come is an integral part of our friend group (we all are really) and I love her and I would feel like we are majorly excluding her if we went without her.


I don't know how to approach it now. I'm tempted to just go and do it with my friends that are up for it but I feel like I'd be a major asshole. I know the answer to this may be compromise but this friend is notoriously stubborn and less 'chill'. I either go behind this friends back and organise with my other friends or organise it right in front of her eyes in the group chat and to me, both of these are cruel. I guess the answer to this is just to give up on this idea of a roadtrip really.

bwur52	2019-06-04 22:02:41	Saint_Delgado	AITA to not want my aunt to come back and visit?	"So my aunt is from Asia and she came to visit us in Canada for two weeks but she really liked it here so she asked to stay for a few months and my mother agreed, considering we were family. So my uncle went back and my aunt stayed behind. First, she wanted to be useful by cooking dinner for me and my sibling since my mother worked but on multiple occasions I would find flies and hair in my food. We would tell her and she just told us not to eat it. Second, we figured out she did not wash her hands after using the washroom. And she made food for us. That’s what got me so paranoid that she didn’t wash her hands before cooking either. Third, she’s walked into my room before without knocking or giving any notice, I found that disrespectful. I told my mother about these issues but she told me to suck it up. The constant talk about how “she’s family,” and how we can’t “disrespect” her considering family traditions and all cause she’s her older brother’s wife. 

She did pay to stay, of course, but her usage of electrical energy was through the roof, she even forgot constantly to close the lights in the living room before heading off to sleep so they stayed on all night as she goes to sleep the latest (most nights).

Now, she keeps talking about coming back to visit. I get that she’s family but she’s incredibly hard to live with. Although she did give my sibling and I a sorta generous amount of money before she left. I feel bad that I was kind of cold towards her near her time leaving but I was fed up, considering I might not see her for a long time as she lives literally on the other side of the world. I never talked to her about my issues with her cause I was trying to be nice. I keep trying to tell my mom to say no to my aunt coming back cause I can’t deal with her again. 

So, what’s the verdict?

EDIT: I should’ve made it clear that my aunt cooked because she was trying to be helpful so I didn’t have to and I’m not very great at it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

It’s important to know that I’m a diabetic and have been under close doctor scrutiny to bring my numbers down (I’m active and healthy, but make terrible eating decisions). I’ve begun to eat much better and monitor my numbers closely.

I teach middle school and this is the last week of classes. My school is a Montessori school, which means there’s a lot of collaborative cooking. Today during my 3rd hour, which happens to be my largest class at 30 kids, the door opened and a student from another class came in. The students had cooked a nice breakfast of pancakes and syrup and eggs and were delivering it personally to all the teachers. 

It looked so delicious. And the kids were so proud! What a kind thing to do! But I said, “Oh I can’t eat that, I’m diabetic!” 

They looked crestfallen and confused. “I’m sorry! It’s the sugar and the carbs; I can’t have them!”

The kids left with the plate very quickly and I called after them: “But thank you so much! I appreciate what you did!”

As they left, my class of kids sort of laughed awkwardly.

I really feel like I did that all wrong and maybe embarrassed the kids. What should I have done? Was I an asshole to them?

TL; DR: Students cooked teachers a nice pancake breakfast and I turned it down in front of 30 kids because I’m a diabetic. I feel I was rude and want to do better."	No A-holes here	0	0
bwupg6	2019-06-04 21:59:01	NODROG07	AITA for not bringing a speedboat to a friend's bachelor party	"Trying to slim this one down, but anyway: friend is getting married soon. For his bachelor party, he wanted to do a houseboat in Northern California-- my family owns a speedboat, so I offered to bring it. He got excited.

Fast forward a couple weeks, he's getting condescending: ""I need to talk to your family, this party will be first-come-first-serve for who can pay up front, it's cheaper if you actually bring the boat"" etc. (side note: am currently rebuilding my life job/finance wise, so tight on money.) I brush it off and work on logistics to try and get boat running/family on board with the idea... they then drag their feet (which is a repeat offense, but sort of just how they communicate), and it drags on to the point where my friend gets bitter, and in so many words, says I shouldn't join, they found another boat and are now overbooked. (Side note here, finances slip further while we're in discussion due to some wack shit my father pulled and left me deeper in the hole.) I apologize to the man; not my intention to muddy up the works for you, my intentions were pure and I thought I'd be able to deliver, very sorry we're out of orbit with each other.

So, question is this: AITA for offering something I thought would work out? This is maybe the second time it's happened for this particular person, and I'm realizing I should already have said offer in hand before offering, especially where my turbulent-ass family is concerned. I think it's ridiculous to stiffen a long term friendship for something like this, but I'm open to being wrong. I also can't stand when people who are my age/equal talk down to me like I'm their insolent teenager, so a little inflamed. This guy does have a habit of talking to me like this, and I'm kind of done with it, since usually it pans out to him bashfully apologizing for calling me a liar/being a dick.

After he saw that he changed the wifi password and renamed it ""get out"".  This was during finals week too. I payed less in rent to account for it since I still payed the electric bill.

"before i (20F) get into the story here is some background information. my mom (40F) married her husband (44M) 10 years ago after online dating. she’s disabled and has severe health problems.. he moved into our house when they got married and he waited 7 years to get a job, he was basically living off my mothers disability. she ended up telling him if he didnt get a job by the time i turned 17 he’d be kicked out, so he got a guard card and has been working since.

everytime we have a family dinner, vacation, any type of outting he throws a temper tantrum like a 5 year old where he gets offended by the smallest thing and storms off. i cant think of a time where the family has had a good time together with zero issues because he will find a way to create one even when my grandparents are present. 

since my mother is starting dialysis on the 18th (2 weeks from now), i thought taking her and my 4 year old half sister  to disneyland would be a great idea since my mother will be starting dialysis and wont be able to go on vacations for a while plus disneyland is something the whole family could enjoy. her husband ended up tagging along.

i went all out, reserved us a room at the disneyland hotel, made sure we had our passes, and got us reservations to the new star wars park that just opened 3 days ago. today we went to that park and for got to ride the newest ride. my moms husband wanted to ride with my sister but she said she’d rather ride with her mom (which should NOT have been a problem), and that made him angry. we walked  around for a few hours and realized we were bored with the park and ready to go to a different park. i guess he was mad from the ride incident, and also because there are no longer smoking sections in disneyland so he told my mom “i dont wanna be around you guys” and stormed off as red as a tomato. i could tell like always his words hurt my mother, but this time i took it extra personal because 1. i paid for the vacation & 2. my mother is going on dialysis in 2 weeks why couldnt he let her have a good time stress free? he starts texting my mom cussing at her and telling her that we make him out to be some bad guy, and it was upsetting my mom so much she turned pale and almost teared up. so i called him and told him he upset everyone and that if he couldnt come back and apologize to my mom right that moment there’s no reason for him to go on a family vacation with us ever again because he always makes sure that he ruins them. he ended up hanging up on me and when my mom heard what i said on the phone she got upset with me. i think it’s because she’d rather pretend it didnt happen and just go on with our day without him at the park with us, but i just had enough. i paid for him to be there. i never once was rude to him and neither was my mom."		1	0

So my best friend and I have known each other for about 6 years and we have been friends on and off, but recently we’ve been close for about a year and a half.  About a month ago he met this girl and the two of them clicked immediately and spent a lot of time chatting over the phone and texting.  However, they met in person and it didn’t go so well.  She told him she lost feelings for him but that she would still like to be friends.   

Throughout this past month she has been constantly changing her mind as to whether or not she likes him.  For example, one night they will talk on the phone for hours and she will make references to them getting married but then the next day she will change her mind and decide she has lost all feelings.  
         
They are still friends, and recently him and I were talking and he told me that he has never met anyone who cares as much as she does.  I was like, hold on a second.  I have been there for you for a year and a half, through everything you’ve gone through with your mental health, been your biggest supporter and you don’t think I care about you the most out of anyone you know? I was super offended.  I tried explaining to him why I was offended but he called me a hypocrite because I have a boyfriend.  Obviously, my boyfriend cares most about me as he has one, known me longer, and two, is romantically interested in me.  Am I being unreasonable?

bwukw2	2019-06-04 21:48:20	tintin808	AITA for how long the mail takes?	"I'm on mobile, English is my first language, I have fat fingers so sorry for mistakes. 

So I graduated from college recently. I got a lot of monetary gifts from friends and family. I left for vacation the day after my graduation. When I returned, I had gotten a letter with a check from my in laws. I immediately bought a thank you card and mailed it out that day. I deposited the check the next day. I was unable to call them due to time difference. We're practically on the other side of the world from each other. I asked my husband if he could call and let them know a letter is on the way. He didn't. 

Long story short, my mother got an email from my MIL saying that they were upset that they didn't get an acknowledgement of their gift. My mother let them know that I had sent a letter. I tried calling and left messages, but I haven't heard anything from them. 

AITA for the letter not getting to them fast enough? Should I have waited to cash their check? My husband keeps telling me it's fine, but then why haven't they returned calls? I wrote a beautiful thank you letter thanking them for all the love and support they've shown over the many years, not just college years. We always communicate by letter, postcards, or snail mail. We hardly ever email."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwukuh	2019-06-04 21:48:14		AITA For being inconsiderate to my friends feelings	"So I have been friends with this girl for a long time. We became very close after both of us sort of losing our best friends and we became each other’s best friends. 
Fast forward a bit of time and we start dating. Things are pretty alright but after a month I realize I am not happy in the relationship and break up with her. We don’t talk for a bit but eventually grow close again. We chill together again and decide to be friends with benefits. 

This is where shit starts to get bad. I know she could easily get emotionally attached in this situation and I want to make sure she’s okay with this and won’t get hurt. I asked her multiple times if she was sure it was what she wanted to do. I talked to her seriously about it for a final time where I told her to think about if it was what she wanted and she said she would think about it. 

Fast forward a couple days and I’m hosting a party with like 10 people. There was a girl there who I was into at the time and I told her while drinking that there was nothing going on between me and the girl. Let’s call her 1. I was into 1 at this time because I wanted to date someone again. I realize now I wasn’t into her because I actually liked her. It was shortly after the party I started dating someone else that we’ll call 2. I liked 2 for a very long time and had asked her out a while ago, but she turned me down not because she didn’t like me but because of different reasons. I found out she was still into me and I still had feelings for her so we started dating and I am very happy with her, and am not dating her just to date someone. After this party the girl (og one) gets very upset and is saying that I didn’t consider her feelings and said that there wasn’t anything going on when there was. My understanding of FWB is that it isn’t romantically involved so dating someone wouldn’t be a problem and we would just stop doing the WB part. She believed that I was going from girl to girl too much and didn’t consider how she would be effected. She also thought that I would play with 2s feelings and leave her heartbroken when I get bored. I have no intention of hurting her and I have told the girl that dating 2 is different. 

The girl blames me and is mad at me for hurting her. AITA?"		1	0

bwujfy	2019-06-04 21:44:49	harborhound	WIBTA if I called cps or the police on my neighbor and their disabled kid?	"So I've tried asking for advice on this topic previously on another sub but didn't get much help.

I bought a house with 2 acres in a rural area with a fence surrounding the entire property because I'm not really into hanging out with my neighbors and I just want some privacy.  I have a large electric sliding gate at the front of my property.

Now I have a neighbor which is two older parents probably in their 60's and their 18 year old disabled son.  This kid has been driving me up the wall for the better part of 2 years now.  First he is obsessed with garbage cans.  He has forced my gate open and broke it multiple times to get in to my garbages.  I just spent $2000 having my gate which he broke tore down and replaced with stronger one which he couldn't pry open.  Well a few days ago I caught him on camera (which I also bought specifically for watching out for him) jumping my fence and grabbing my cans and running down my driveway with them.

Additional issues are he makes very loud screaming noises which sends my youngest son running scared into the house when he comes around, my wife was once late for work because she couldn't get out of the driveway after he broke the gate and had to wait for me to come home and fix it, the financial and time expenses he has caused me, the lack of privacy of someone constantly coming on our property, the fact his parents promised me 4 and 5 times over that it won't happen again and it never stops, and last but not least I am concerned he will eventually be hit by a car as people pass our property going 50+ mph and he is regularly near the road unsupervised.

My wife wants me to keep reporting him every incident but my mom whose is a special education teacher said I would be ass and should be supportive to their troubles.  I just want to be left alone.

TLDR: WIBTA if I called the cops on my disabled neighbor that won't leave us alone and has broke our stuff?

Edit:. I don't want anything bad to happen the kid he isn't evil or anything he is just not cared for properly.  I don't know what his disability is but he seems to be of very low intelligence. He cannot talk and doesn't seem to understand what I'm saying when I try to talk to him.  After reading everyone's opinions I think I'm just going to call it in every time there is an incident from here on out."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwug8l	2019-06-04 21:37:10	regredditgirl091030	WIBTA if I abandon a 3 year lease leaving my parents to handle 1650 rent on their own?	"I (29F) and my partner (35M) got a rental place last year with my parents (63/64) because their house was foreclosed on by the bank. My dad was gambling away their mortgage and my mom is addicted to putting things on credit or rent to own accounts. I was expecting a baby so we needed a place with enough space for a baby, so we thought we'd pool our funds and get a place for all of us. We split the rent equally and have equal living spaces and access to shared spaces.

My parents had initially liked my partner, my dad still does. My Mom hates him now because he doesn't let her control him and rather than just treating her as the be all end all source of child rearing information he does research and we make choices for our babies health and care based off that. (One benefit is that at least we know that our 9 month old doesn't seem to have any allergies since my mother has given her peanut butter, cow's milk, and fruit juices even though you're supposed to wait til a year for all these foods. ) She acts like a victim whenever he tells her that's not appropriate and once in a private conversation she admitted to trying to break us up by causing friction in the house.

Often she waits until my partner and my father are no longer in the house before coming into my and the babies private space and trying to manipulate me into seeing and doing things her way and whenever I have given an inch she'll take a mile and tell my partner and my father that I said she could and this will cause my partner and I to fight.

The living situation has proved to be inhospitable and too stressful when factoring in my status as a fairly new mom living with ppd and bpd. I haven't spoken to my partner yet, but I know that he is unhappy as well due to the fact that she makes it known how little she wants him around and its affecting our relationship with each other, but we've got three years left on our 4 year lease. I think if she wants him gone so bad then so be it, but she'll be losing me and our daughter/her grand daughter as well."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwuerq	2019-06-04 21:33:54	icanbitemyownelbow	AITA for not lending my car to my brother anymore?	"Context: I live alone with my brother. He totaled his car last December and is usually borrowing mine to do stuff. Nothing important, just for groceries and for bringing his girlfriend to spend time with him (her house is a 5 min walk distance)

Today, he used my car for something equally unimportant and the battery failed. No big deal.
I was to get another one today, but since it's kind of late, I couldn't, and I asked him to get one tomorrow. I would pay, obviously.

What made me not want to borrow him my car again was that he responded with a crude ""no"" to my request and the reason was that the car was mine and not his. The thing is, everything he does, he asks for my car, even it's a 5 minute walk distance, and most of the time I dont even ask for gas. I never said no to him, but now, I think he deserves to be walking or getting uber to places.

But on the other hand, I'm feeling petty and guilty for thinking that.

More info: I'm 23, he is 22. He doesn't help with insurance or documents regarding the car. We are both unemployed uni students with the same aliment pension money we receive from our father.
We have almost no expenses since our mother let us live in her house without paying rent, water or electricity. So I use my money for food, gas, maintaining my car, books and equipment required for internships or laboratory classes. Since he never goes to uni and is basically a leech, I dont know what he spends his money on besides pizza (that's harsh buts it's the truth and he even acknowledges it), and he's perfectly able to spend some in uber or even hold money to get another car. We have bikes too."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwuef2	2019-06-04 21:33:05	brother_or_not	AITA for not wanting a relationship with a ‘sibling’ I’ve never met?	"I am a first generation Vietnamese American in my late 20s. 15 or so years ago, my mother beat cancer but due to treatments - had to get her tubes tied. I was a child at the time, so I am unclear as to why specifically - but I remember her going into surgery with the purpose of a tubal ligation. Because of this, her and my dad were never able to try for the son they’ve always wanted. A few years later, my mother’s cousin who still lives in Vietnam ends up pregnant, but is contemplating abortion because of the cost of raising a child (they already have 2 daughters).

My parents step in and offer to adopt the child if it’s a boy, and it ends up being a boy. My mother’s cousin agrees to raise the boy as their ‘aunt’ if my parents financially support him and agree they will work on eventually getting him immigrated over to the States. My sister and I were uncomfortable with the idea, but because of cultural expectations I kept my feelings and opinions to myself and never said anything to my parents. I would like to preface that I have never said anything negative about him - because I have never said anything about him at all.

Through the years pictures are sent back and forth, money is sent back, my parents visit once every 1-2 years, and the child is taught that his real parents are his aunt/uncle, and these people are his parents, so he calls them such. My parents tell him he has two sisters that live back in the US and that someday they will come back for him. I have never spoken to him on the phone or video chatted with him, nor have I ever wanted too. My parents do not push the issue. Throughout the years, they haven’t taken any steps towards getting him immigrated over, they just send money and talk to him every once in a while, still having him call them mom and dad.

If I had to guess, I’d say my ‘brother’ is around 10 years old now. I look at his pictures and I can see him resembling my mother’s cousin more as he grows older. I can’t help but wonder when he’s going to piece it together or when his older sisters will tell him the truth. He’s recently gotten a Facebook and is trying to connect with me on it. My sister has accepted his request, saying it’s harmless and he doesn’t want anything. That may be true, but I just don’t feel any sort of connection to him and don’t want a relationship with him. I leave his request alone.

Over the weekend, he added my husband, who accepted because he recognized some of my family members as mutuals. When he brought it up to me, I asked him to please unfriend him because I don’t want a relationship with him and I don’t want to let him into my life because I’ve never met him, don’t see him as a brother, and don’t even know where to begin to say anything to him at this point. My husband unfriends him no questions. My sister was in the room when this happened, and she thinks I am being weird about the whole thing.

"We found out we’re pregnant last week on Wednesday and decided we’d keep it a secret until the first trimester is over. On Saturday night we got into an argument and I started heavily cramping and asked him to take me to the hospital. He said back “all of a sudden” and I started crying and saying we needed to go he repeatedly asked me why I was crying so loud and I told him I was in pain he responded with I was being dramatic so I told him to get out of my car and I would drive myself. He stormed off and I went back home and had my mom accompany me. On our way there I told her I was pregnant and she asked where my boyfriend was and started calling him asking him why he wasn’t here with me and his response was “we’ll you’re there with her she doesn’t need me” later on that night I’m the ER I reached out to his mom trying to get in contact with her son and she asked if I was ok I said yes but that I needed her son to be with me she asked if I was pregnant and I didn’t respond but she knew. And so I said yes one month in and I’m worried I just need your son here with me. 

She told me everything would be ok and that not to worry about him. That the baby is more important to focus on. I asked her not to say anything and she said she wouldn’t. 

The next day I told her I was going to go to her house to speak with him about everything and he threatened to leave so she yelled back and told him if  wants this baby he needs to stay his ass at home and speak to me like a grown man, and if he wanted to be a coward to leave and she’ll let me know that he doesn’t want it. 

He ended up stay and we talked (didn’t go well)
And at the end of the day he told me how selfish I am for telling his parents and taking such a special memory away from him. And after cussing me out and telling me how terrible I am for doing such a thing, broke up with me.

..I started feeling bad for the whole thing and now I’m just so stuck up on the fact that I did ruin such a special moment for him..  AireallyTA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

EVEN THOUGH SHE SAID SHE MIGHT'VE HAD IT HERSELF. when i tried to explain that i wasn't sure if i was straight or not, she told me i was far too young to know. i couldn't even tell her i went to counselling in school last year for a few months. also, if i'm honest, there's a few things she's done that could be classed as harassment: felt my thighs, touching me from behind on the butt. this makes it worse because i get so highly uncomfortable, i really hate being touched unless i was the initiator, so for me the issue is heightened. (for context i am a 14 y/o girl) when i tell her it made me uncomfortable her response is always 'but it's only me' and 'i'm your mother i'm allowed to'. so that begs the question; am i the asshole? i really feel like i am because i feel like i am belittling my mum's problems. i don't doubt she has/had them, but at the same time that doesn't mean she can ignore mine. advice is welcome! thank you for reading this all, but if you haven't then TL;DR i have problems, mum makes situation about her all the time"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So basically I know how it sounds, and it might be  how it is but consciously I didn't deliberately keep tinder guys to talk to. The guy I started dating found out that there was still random snaps I would get from some guys on snapchat that I rarely replied to and he didn't like it. I think that I didn't delete the guys because I didn't want to have the awkward conversation of ""hi I met someone I'm going to delete you now."" Its cowardly and unfortunate but it is what it is. One of the guys had sent me his address for me to send his shirt I still had. That didn't look good but I wasn't lying when I said that's why he sent his address. Its the only thing I saved in the chat because why save anything else, all I need is the address to send the shirt. Another had been someone I met through Reddit who had saved nudes in the chat that I didn't even remember about from January! The others (maybe 4 total) I just expected to eventually not talk to them anymore and just delete when there was a week or two of silence. Dumb logic but again, it is what it is. There was also one guy on instagram that I had replied to a few times and was a little witty. At the time I don't think it meant anything, I didn't want to date him and I quite frankly don't think I ever would have. That also did not look great. Basically all in all, I really care/cared for the guy I was with and looked forward to his texts, calls, visits every single day. I was always open with him from the beginning in regards to tinder. I told him I told the people I was talking to that I was dating someone. Which I did. I told him I'll eventually stop talking to them. I think I wasn't clear enough with me ""plan"" and the big misunderstanding is that a month in I was still getting random snaps (non innappropriate). This guy matched with me so well we both agreed and I won't go into many details because we are done, he couldn't handle the trust I broke. I understand his view of course and his history of being cheating on does help but I truly never lied and feel terrible. I know now how dumb it was of me to not just delete the guys. Like, man the fuck up girl, but anyways. What do y'all think? AITA for not deleting tinder guys I have zero interest in?

bwu9ix	2019-06-04 21:21:45	Elainaleee	AITA for being upset with a mentally disabled person?	"I work at a grocery store and we have this mom and son who shop there regularly. The son is about 20 years old, and mentally disabled (he’s non-verbal I guess? He makes sounds, but it’s not discernible). His mom doesn’t make really any attempts at controlling his behavior; he gets very excited in the store and likes to run up to people, grab groceries off the belt, etc. She apologizes sometimes but that’s about it. 

Anyway, today he came running at me, arms up like he was asking for a hug. I was cornered at my register and tried saying “no no thank you” but he kept coming up to me and planted a kiss on my shoulder, full of chocolate-stained drool (which left a nasty spot on my uniform). I felt really uncomfortable about this, almost violated. I feel like I had no power to do anything to stop him. 

To add to that, a few years ago, he lifted up his shirt and I saw his penis, which obviously was uncomfortable and unwanted. 

So I guess what I’m asking is, am I the asshole for feeling upset/mad at him? I know he’s mentally challenged and maybe doesn’t understand what’s going on, but I also feel like i shouldn’t compromise my personal space/comfort because of that."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I'm at the end of my first year of university away from home, and I'm right in the middle of my exams, so things have been pretty stressful lately. I still try to video-call home every night when I'm done with my revision, and my parents and I usually chat for 20-30 minutes or so before bed.

This week is going to be particularly intense for me: I had an exam today, have another tomorrow, and two more the day after that. I guess I was sort of distracted while talking to my parents tonight. Might have answered with a few more monosyllables than usual. And at some point my mum laughed and said, ""Oh my gosh, look at how grumpy she is!"", and that rubbed me the wrong way.

I love my mum to the moon and back and she's usually great, but she does have this habit of lightly mocking my bad moods. She will validate and comfort me if I'm seriously upset, but if she thinks I'm just being an angsty teen she'll make fun of me, and tonight I really didn't have the energy to deal with it. I just said ""Call you guys tomorrow after the exam, night night"" and hung up.

I recognise I'm not the most auto-ironic person, and I do tend to take some things personally even when they're not meant to, but this whole deal makes me feel like I only have a right to be in a bad mood when something major has gone wrong.

bwu632	2019-06-04 21:13:24	lattucie	WIBTA if I told my uncle-in-law that my aunt cheated on him?	"My Aunt (who I will refer to as A from hence forth), currently lives with her fiancé (UIL). 

UIL is considered apart of the family. He's bonded really well with everyone in it, and everyone considers themselves really close with him. A is very close with everyone in his family, too.

A is often forced to do chores for the family, specifically for her mother-in-law. UIL has a very strange relationship with his mother, and is very, very close to her. Not too long ago, he went on a trip to Korea with her, without A. 

Unfortunately, A uses these to justify her actions.

Last weekend, she took UIL's sister out for a 'girls weekend.' She picked up a guy and banged him. 

She swore my mother not to tell anyone, but my mother really, really sucks at keeping secrets. It wasn't long before she told me exactly what happened. 

Soon after, my brother confessed to seeing her sending a video of herself fingering herself to someone, while she was in the relationship with UIL. And a few nights prior, she showed me a dick pic someone sent her.

My dad and I are of the very strong opinion that we should tell UIL. My brother and mother disagree. 

UIL's mother is very controlling. If word were to reach her, A would likely be in harms way and kicked out onto the street. And my household wouldn't want to take her in, nor would any one else in my family.

My mum is worried about losing contact with A, her sister. Frankly, I couldn't care less what happens to her, and I would be very happy if we DID lose contact. 

TL/DR: My aunt has been caught multiple times sending and receiving lewd images, and this weekend she cheated on her fiancé. However, things may backfire greatly for her, to the point where her mother-in-law may hurt her.

bwu3an	2019-06-04 21:06:48	daisychains3	AITA for venturing off on my (27/f) own during a 5 day international bachelorette?	"Just realized this is my second post about bachelorette parties haha.

This past week I went to Ibiza for a 5 day bachelorette. I live in the states so this was obviously a massive, expensive vacation. When all was said and done, I probably spent ~2,500, on flights, the villa we stayed in, meals, transport, etc.

It has been a dream of mine to go to Spain for a long time so I was super excited for this trip! I did everything asked of me In preparation for the trip, including mailing party decorations to Spain, venmoing the organizer on time for everything etc.

There was a semi-strict itinerary that involved dinners, scuba trip, beach days, clubbing days, etc. Anytime there was a group activity like dinner in a themed outfit or going on a boat, I did it.

The problem started on the scuba trip. We all paid around $250 American to go on this trip. Well, when we got on the water, the other girls just wanted to take pictures on the boat and I was the only one who actually went scuba diving. I stayed out by myself with the instructor for the whole excursion. No one seemed really bothered but it was obvious I’d separated myself. 

That night we all did dinner together, next morning went to the beach together, etc.

The following day I wanted to explore the town. No one else did, they wanted to lay on the beach again. So, I went by myself. I had a great time! 

This continued for several days where the girls just wanted to take pictures on the beach every day and I wanted to do activities or visit places I’ve dreamed my entire life about. Every day I made sure to participate in something if it was a legit plan, like a cooking class, which I loved. I also made all the pregames and dinners. For breakfast sometimes Iventured with one or two girls (out of 15) to a local spot.

Now it’s the end of the trip and I get the feeling everyone thinks I’m a bad friend. I genuinely don’t know. IMO this was my vacation too, that I paid for, and I shouldn’t have to stick with the group 100% of the time."	No A-holes here	0	0

bwu1d9	2019-06-04 21:02:23		AITA for being mad at my family for going to a show without me?	"To start, I am M15

A couple months ago Hugh Jackman announced he is doing a tour around the UK, me, being a big fan of his work, asked my parents if we could go! They said they didn't have the money, obviously I was pretty sad about this but I understood and moved on.

On Sunday, my Mother told me that on Monday she won't be back until late as she has to work. I thought that was fine and continued my day.

Monday comes around, it's just me and my dad. My brother and my mother are both gone. I start getting a bit suspicious but decided I'm probably looking too far into it: so there, I went to bed but stayed up on my phone till around 2am.

2am rolls and all 3 of them come back at the same time, I know something is wrong because the shop my mother works at closes at 12AM. I start getting suspicious and I look on my Facebook. 5-6 hours before my mum posted ""Having a meal before the show, super excited!"" I was pretty confused, why did they lie to me about it? My mum goes to many shows so I assumed she just went to another one that I wasn't interested in. That is, until, I read the comments.

""What are you excited for?""
""We're seeing Hugh Jackman!""

This was it, I was mad. I had asked my mum for weeks so she has no reason to think I didn't want to go.

Today, when I come home from school I ask how her work went, knowing fully well what happened. She continues to lie: my brother almost let's it slip and my mum shuts him up. This is where I had enough, told them I knew and haven't talked to my mum since.

I was really looking forward to this when it was announced and to find out my family went without me and didn't even want to tell me hurts.

bwu04s	2019-06-04 20:59:33	AvengerGeni	WIBTA if I changed my unborn son's name?	"I am having a baby with someone I barely knew when I got pregnant. As time has gone by, things have come to light about my baby's father that I'm just not ok with. Namely, the fact that he's an alcoholic. I understand that being an alcoholic is rough and it is a disease but what bothers me is that he does not want to do anything about it. We have talked numerous times about him getting help and that I would do whatever he needed me to do to get him through it but he always says no. 

&#x200B;

My breaking point was when he showed up drunk to (and continued to drink throughout) an infant safety and cpr class that we both decided to take so that we would be prepared for when our son is born. I told him after this incident that I could not be with him anymore because I couldn't trust him. I also told him that he can come see his son whenever he would like but that until he gets help and can show that he's getting better, I can't trust him to take the baby anywhere on his own. This happened about 6 weeks ago. I have not heard from him since. He sent me money for a few weeks and then even that stopped. 

&#x200B;

He and I had chosen a name for our baby (which was really a name that he wanted and I agreed even though I wasn't super thrilled with it because the baby could have a nickname that I was ok with) before all of this happened and now I'm thinking about changing it to something I like better and giving the baby my last name instead of his.

bwtzy8	2019-06-04 20:59:08	badguy1123	AITA for reporting a rude delivery guy?	"Quite a long one but it's what happened to me today.

We have a local online for delivery service which caters 24x7 to anyone ordering food from any open restaurants nearby. Me and my friend decided to order dinner from it. It was quite late but we went ahead because of the 24x7 feature. 

We ordered food and it was accepted and prepared by the restaurant. But the delivery guy wasn't there to pick it up. So after 90 minutes (45 minutes after the estimated delivery time), we called the delivery guy from his given number in the app. After a dozen calls, he finally picks up and I told him that we were calling about the order. He rudely and angrily replied ""you're calling me this late about your order"" and told us that he clocked out 20 minutes after we placed the order. Then I asked him if he could just cancel the order on his part as there was no option for me to cancel 15 minutes after placing the order. He replied something angrily, hung up on us and switched off his cellphone.

If he'd have just cancelled on his part, the order will be assigned to some other active guy and we'd have got our food. But he didn't and was really unprofessional with the handling of the call. So I reported him to the company via an email. Then we went to the restaurant directly and got our food which we made via the app(I didn't actually knew we could do this and went to the restaurant to ask what should be done).

The representative called within 20 minutes (remember that this is late at night) and asked about the incident. I told him exactly what happened. He apologized to me and told me that the issue would be raised to higher ups. 

After the call, I felt guilty that I may have ruined thus guy's job or something. I had told the representative that I got the food from restaurant but he refunded the money to me anyways. AITA?

bwtzvj	2019-06-04 20:58:54		AITA For sleeping with a younger girl?	"Throw away for reasons. So for starters, I'm 20. It's also worth noting that I have a broken leg. 

Last weekend, my brother (18m) had a bit of small get together with some of his friends (I live at home for the time being as I am unable to work), involving drinking and all that good stuff. Among the group was 2 girls, who look about 16/17 (legal age of consent in my country).

The night went on and nothing particularly eventful happened until the end of the night, when I decided to go inside. After a few drinks, with my leg in the state that it is, I asked for someone to help me get to my room, incase I fell or w/e. When we get near my room, I decide that I'm going to use the bathroom before bed, thinking the two girls are going to go back outside, However, they had other plans and where waiting for me in my bedroom, which went how you would imagine it, however I didn't think to actually ask they're ages. 

When I woke up the next morning, I made sure they had enjoyed the night and if the needed anything, to which they said yes, and neither where upset. Everything seemed okay until I asked one of the girls for her age, which was fifteen. 

My brother did find out about this, his room is down the hall from mine. He says I'm a dirtbag because one of the girls was fifteen and that I had actually been taking to another one of his female friends and helping her navigate recovering from drug abuse (I had a cocaine problem when I was 18, and my father was addicted to oxycontin, so I know my way around addiction relatively well.)

My argument is that I had been drinking, and that any straight guy probably would have done the same as me. Am I the asshole?

bwtwcl	2019-06-04 20:50:53	Scruter	WIBTA if I told my mom we don’t want our kids to use the grandmother name she chose?	"My husband and I are expecting a baby girl in November. First grandchild on both sides, and I'm an only child so our kids will my parents' only grandchildren ever. My mom announced the other day that she had decided what she wants the baby to call her: Mormor. It's Norwegian for ""grandmother (mother's mother)."" My dad is going with Grandpa.

Some background: we are white Americans with families that have been here for generations. My mom has always been into family history but has gotten more into genealogy since she retired. She has always had an affinity for the Norwegian element in our family history and has really fixated on it (my name is actually technically a Norwegian name, but one that is super common for Americans my age too), and has found and gotten I touch with some distant Norwegian cousins. I love Norway and think our distant cousins are lovely, but I have never understood my mom's over-identification with that branch of the family specifically. Our Norwegian ancestors came to America in the 19th century, and she is at best 1/8th Norwegian. Meanwhile, we're both more than half English, but she shows little interest in anything British. The Norwegian branch is through my mom's mom, whom I called Grandma, and my mom called her mom's mom Grandma. Because we're American. Nobody has used Norwegian words for generations or spoken the language. 

When my mom said she wanted to be called Mormor, I told her my immediate reaction, which was, ""isn't that a little...contrived?"" My mom asked why, and I said because we're not Norwegian, we're American. She was surprisingly non-defensive and said she didn't have to use it if we hated it. I backed off of that and told her I wasn't going to tell her what to do. She said we can talk about it more later. My husband and I have talked about it and have a hard time imagining referring to my mom as Mormor to our daughter. It feels like indulging a weird exoticization of Norway and Norwegian-ness and kind of embarrasses us. But she’s also 70 and this is her only grandchild. Should we get over it to make her happy, or ask her to choose something else?

Edit: To be clear, I'm asking if we would be TA if we ask her to choose something else, which we want to do."	No A-holes here	0	0
bwtvza	2019-06-04 20:50:03	JelloCute	AITA for refusing to help my mom due to her manipulative tendencies?	"I love my mom, and a lot of people love their moms. However I have always been the kind of person the silently step away from an unhealthy relationship and I believe that’s what I’m doing.

For most of my life, I’ve dont the cooking, everyone’s laundry, and I’ve cleaned everything. Only for it to pile up again. If it’s not done, my mom threatens to harm herself or someone else. It’s not a pretty situation, and I admit I’ve shown up to school with bruises. 

As of recently, I’ve started online school, so I can help around the house and be comfy at home. I have a part time job and my supervisors are already extremely impressed with my worth ethic, and I’ve only worked there two months. When I get home and I finish a few lessons for the day, I’m usually tired. However, it also means I have to clean up which ever messes my mom and brother make. If my brother leaves a towel on the floor, I’m blamed. If my brother leaves dishes on the counter, I’m told to clean it up. If I don’t? I get either a book, chair, or shoe thrown at me. My mom can throw anything she likes into my room, but if I don’t clean up something that isn’t mine, I’m in trouble.

My mom is the most angry person I know, and when she’s angry there’s no stopping her. She’ll call me everything u see the sun. After she apologizes, tells me she was in the wrong, before saying it’s my fault and I need to do more for the family. She’s stopped me from doing school in favour of helping clean, because according to her, my schooling is less important.

I’ve stopped helping her, and I only do things that I need to do. I clean up my own messes, I wash my clothes, I do everything for myself. She’s gotten angry that I don’t help her with stuff anymore, but I honestly have given up caring. I’m just counting down the days to move out.

"So this new guy was hired and I’ve been informally put in charge of mentoring him and making sure he is a good fit. Upper management will take my recommendation on him in the next couple of months. I know from people on his interview panel that he was not the most qualified. However, he interviews well. One of his answers was that he can come into any situation and get along with anybody. 

Anyway, I found out today that he is dating my ex from about 5 years ago. Her and my breakup was a little bit tumultuous. He mentioned that he knew me and that she is now “enjoying something much bigger”. He said this to me with a smirk on his face. I immediately got defensive and said he doesn’t know what he’s talking about and that I doubt it’s true. He brought up that it was true and that he knew that she cheated on me because of it. I know that she cheated on me in the past with several people (not sure if he was ever one of those people), and that knowledge stings quite a bit. So for him to bring it up and basically rub it in my face that he is with her now really sucks. 

This is a good job and I’m torn about wrecking him financially. But, I also know that she lives with him and isn’t currently working. So for him to get fired would hurt them both. The thought of fucking her over is appealing.

He has struggled in Math all year. His teacher went above and beyond for him, we got him outside help, and he gets it when it comes to homework assignments, but then tanks on tests. 

We told him summer school is an option for math, but he has taken that as “ill just give up on the rest of my classes”. He hasn’t turned anything in, missed projects, etc. 

I’m thinking he is simply too immature to handle the workload that our school system throws at kids, and maybe doing 6th again will help him get a better foundation moving forward.

"Like the title said GF asked me if we could go see her niece graduate from HS, I agreed as I thought we could do that and spend some time there and then also have a nice vacation. I buy the tickets and make the arrangements for the accommodations no big deal, happy to do it. Then I find out her mother wants to share the same flight, fine I’m not paying but I don’t mind driving her to her daughters house from the airport  in the rental (somewhat rural so a few hours). 

The problem happens when this week I make a suggestion on what we can do one night (me and her) and she tells me her sister may already have plans. That’s when I tell her “no like me and you” this is when she starts telling me things like “yeah you can do do that” indicating to me that I’m free to do whatever but she is only there to see her family and she hasn’t seen them for a year and probably won’t see them for the rest of the year.

Am I the asshole for being annoyed that she wants this to be just a trip to see her family? I feel like I’m the third wheel here. I tell her as much and we get in a fight and now I’m not even sure I want to go. I work a ton and haven’t had a real vacation in over a year and have been incredibly stressed with work, I just don’t want to spend all my vacation time at her sisters house.

For reference we have gone on a couple of vacations together and I thought this was more of a combo trip. I make a lot more than her so I was happy to pay but now I feel used.

Edit - thanks for all the feedback, I think ultimately the lesson learned here is communication. You shouldn’t expect for your SO to know what you want/need without communicating effectively. 

We talked and agreed that the primary focus of the trip was and is about seeing and spending time with her family, but as we had discussed when booking the me trip (sorry I didn’t make that clear) we are going to take time for us as well."	Asshole	0	0

bwtuv5	2019-06-04 20:47:30	Rican1884	AITA for not allow my wife's half sister to live with us	"Her half sister is not blood related to her or her father.  He dad hooked up with a lady south of the border who already had this child in the states and she abandoned them and fled back to Mexico.  He basically raised her since the age of 2.  There has never been a ton of interaction between my wife and her unless she went to visit him in North Carolina.  Her father was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and went through chemo and was able to go into remission.  He also decided to move back to Texas where he is originally from.  His cancer came back in 2015 and his health declined so i told my wife that he needs to move in with us because having you go back and forth for his appts. from Florida isn't really feasible.  He was pretty adamant about being the only penis in the house.  Which i understand, he had his way i had mine but we had a good relationship.  His health finally got to the point where he couldn't do anything without help and finally moved in with us.  He refused to move in unless his daughter came with.  I'm not exactly a fan of it but i said ok to appease my wife.  Now this was with the understanding that i do not plan on letting her stay here if or when he passes and that she can move with her biological aunt in the north.  We are on the same page at this point.

&#x200B;

Her dad's last request was for us to allow her to at least stay through high school so she at least has a stable home.  Reluctantly i agree because i'm not going to deny a dying man's wish.  He passes and the daughter stays with us, has her own room and bathroom, doesn't pay any bills, has her own car that we helped pay for and honestly not asked anything of her.  She doesn't cook for the family and really keeps to herself.  She was a junior in HS.  She does have an ungrateful attitude about things which get on our nerves and we deal with it best we can.  After the last spat between my wife and her (1year ago), she was given notice that she needs to figure out what she wants to do with her life because once she graduates she needs to move out.  We are prior military and tried to give her a few options in that field.  She finally scores high enough to be looked at by the army but she has to lose 50 pounds before they will even look at her.   So we gave her a goal for the month of may she needs to lose at least 5 pounds by the end of the month, as long as she continues to lose the weight she can stay because it shows that your actually trying to better yourself.  She looses nothing so come June 8 she'll be heading out to the north.  She's asked to stay longer but honestly we can't really deal with the teen angst anymore and the fact she's not really trying by still eating fast food.  I also have to younger kids in the house.  

&#x200B;

Clarification she is not 16 or 17 she is 19 years old now she was held back one year.  my wife is of the same mind that she doesn't need to live with us anymore our deal was until graduation of high school. she's known that this has been coming for the last three years that she's been with us her father did not just die it's been about two and a half years.



So AITA for not letting her stay?

"I have a dog, I found him on the side of the road, he’s friendly unless you run charging at him, then he gets aggressive out of fear. Today I was gardening and had him on a leash beside me because he wants to be where I am.

Our apartment complex has a lot of kids and for the most they’ll do as they’re told, albeit reluctantly, a lot of them have never heard the word “No”. The family next door to us are pretty good friends and I adore their youngest two daughters, especially the youngest, Princess (not her real name, I just spoil her, she’s very well behaved)

The family often has a lot of kids over, children of friends, today one little girl came charging at my dog, I jumped up and said “Leave him alone!” She stopped but just stared at me, challenging me, she wasn’t going to go anywhere but neither was I. My dog was just enjoying the sun and she had no right to bother him. Her brother came to get her but she screamed like a banshee when he tried to pull her away. Princess and her friend who is there almost every day looked to see what was going on, my mom noticed them and asked if they wanted a popsicle. I buy them some every summer and they just come and get them when they want, I knew that giving the two of them popsicles would mean I would have to give this Satan baby one too so I put my doggo on my hip and said “No popsicles, I told this hard-headed girl to leave the dog alone and she didn’t listen so no one gets anything!”

The other kids protested loudly but I wasn’t having it. I took doggo into the house and came back out, I called Princess over and told her she and her friend could come and get a popsicle later but that the other girl couldn’t have one because she scared the dog and that was mean. Princess said “Okay” And bounced off, all smiles.

Mom thinks I went too far but I think that the child didn’t deserve a popsicle, however I also think it would have been cruel to give everyone one but her so I just withheld them completely, at least until she leaves. AITA?

And when when I have tried to go to her during the night she has told me that she's too tired and goes back to sleep and disregards me. Also, she has yelled at me before and said that I'm dramatic, irrational, and selfish. She also gets really mad at me when I don't go to her, but I've decided that that's the best choice.

Because of this, I receive the minimum loan, as well as them halving it because they apparantley overpaid me last year. I get £600 a term. My rent alone is £450 a month.

My mum and dad give me enough each month to pay for my rent which I feel shitty about. I had a job for a few months but it was a startup pub and there was big drama because they didn't pay anyone, and somehow got away with it. I've maxed out my 1.5k overdraft (which my parents don't know about), from having to pay for all the other essentials- food, clothes, textbooks, filming equipment (uni) , hockey equipment, events, household essentials (like we didn't have a kettle, toaster, hoover etc so all had to chip in). 

My step-dad doesn't contribute to this at all. He is a lovely man, we've always gotten on well, he takes an interest in my life. But he doesn't seem to grasp that I'm only in such a dire situation because of him. If I just lived with my mum and brother still, I'd have a significantly higher loan. I know it's not directly his fault, I'm not his child or his responsibility. My mum is constantly stressed about money and he acts so gracious to offer to pay for things for her. If she didn't have to give me £300 a month she would have so much more freedom, I sometimes wonder if he likes her having to rely on him. 

I just feel so bitter about it everytime I come home. He's made jokes like 'since you're the only one at University you should be able to help us pay off our mortgage in a few years'. I came back after a couple of months and he mentioned how much weight I'd lost, and I couldn't stop myself from replying that it was because I couldn't afford food, not by choice.

Genuinley want to know if I'm being immature here. I'm already sponging off two people and I'm complaining that I can't sponge off a third.

Edit: Should've mentioned- I have a part time job at a supermarket at home, which is only a couple of weeks over Christmas and over summer. My Uni is in a small town with hundreds of students, I've been applying for jobs for months but never even get interviews, there is too much competition. Doesn't help that I can't get a reference from the pub I worked at."	No A-holes here	0	0

bwtnfn	2019-06-04 20:30:09		WIBTA for blowing a whistle on an acquaintance's arranged marriage behavior to help a friend-of-a-friend?	"The title is really confusing, I know, but I don't know how to put it in a better way.  Let's get it all the details in.

I'm Indian American, in a small college town, which means sometimes it feels like every Indian here knows everyone else. Cue my best friend's cousin who we'll call C. I found out through my best friend that C's looking to meet girls through his family. Now this is not uncommon in this community, and unlike the stereotypes, there aren't any requirements of either party agreeing to marry who their parents setup. But rather date in a way that's not unlike what happens normally in the general American community.

My cousin tells me that C's talking with and dating S who I happen to know well. She and I were in the same dorms in college, and we're part of various social groups. I even meet her every other month or so at a volunteering thing I do.

I checked this on facebook and instagram and I know for a fact that C is in a relationship with another person. In fact, it's the same person she was with in college. But he's not Indian and her parents will be ballistic at the thought. I'm quite confident she's stringing C along for a few months to lay her parents off of her case.

I even met C once with my cousin, and he happened to ask him about how things are going with the arranged marriage process (which is what it's commonly called) and he mentioned that it was going slow, but apparently hoping to go somewhere. 

There's a big part of me that really wants to just blow the whistle on all of this. Either tell my cousin, or tell C directly or ... something. 

My boyfriend cautions against this because it's a small community and things might get real messy (because effectively I'm outing S's relationships). From what I've heard about C, I think he's a fantastic individual and doesn't deserve to be hurt or strung along.

bwtkz7	2019-06-04 20:24:26	GeneralDarian	WIBTA for not practicing the cello?	"So, a few days ago we had these ""book awards"" (basically school-wide awards) where you can win in certain categories. Well, for strings, I won the award for playing the Cello. As soon as I got the award, my teacher asked me to play a solo, and I signed up. Problem is that the solo is during exam week. I told my mom, and she is now making me play every single day until the concert. 

Tomorrow, my first exams come up - English and German, two of my hardest subjects, followed by Physics. I told my mom that I would play either less or not at all tomorrow - she denied and said that I must play the full time. 

Her arguments are:
* Cello is a valuable skill that you have to practice every single day.
* The teacher gave me the award and I need to show that I am responsible and show that I am his best student by playing the solo well.
* If I skip a cello practice, then [according to her] I will stop playing the cello altogether. 


Tomorrow is Wednesday, the solo is on Friday. I went to a cello lesson today and the teacher told me that its okay if I practice the hard bits for 15 mins or so. I told this to my mom, and she didn't budge. I still feel like not practicing tomorrow seems like the wisest choice, as not only will these be two difficult exams, but I have to come home via public, which takes a while. 

I love playing the cello. It is a part of me that has gotten me on several school trips, but I think that sometimes I need to prioritize and choose one subject over cello for one day. My mom doesn't think so.

bwtk4o	2019-06-04 20:22:27	Healing_touch	AITA for handling family relations the way I do?	"First, this is going to be one of those where it’ll be easy to say NTA because I’m justified in wanting to put space between my family and myself (I grew up abused). It’s about HOW I’m doing it that I’m looking for clarification on. 

To boil 26 years of life with my parents down to a quick paragraph...my mom has BPD, my dad is an Enabler with a Capital E, and my youngest sister has autism that wasn’t diagnosed until she was 18 (my parents refused to get her tested because....? Reasons). My mom would abuse, use, and abandon us & told me when I was a kid that my sister was my job now she was done parenting. So I was the adult growing up, raising 3 dysfunctional people while also trying to raise myself. My mom eventually got on medication, got better, had some slip ups, but ultimately other than one massive back slide 2 years ago, has been a 180 turn about of who she used to be (this happened about 4 years ago). 

I originally cut them out of my life, she realized I was serious & that’s what forced her to seek some help. We’ve kinda(?) worked on the relationship & it’s better. But I have massive trust issues from growing up & often don’t let them in on my life, I’m definitely less warm
  with them than I am with anyone else in my life. 

So issue...they saved about 100k for my sister to attend college & for her wedding & had nothing for me (my mom resented me stealing my dad away from her when I was a baby plus I looked like her sister who was a bitch) but in the last few Year’s they felt bad for the imbalance of financial support between my sister and I so they helped with a modest down payment on my house ( a loan of 2500) plus assisting with my credit card and cellphone each month (around 250 total). 

While the relationship is better, there wasn’t much work done (there was an apology once, but a sweeping one and a lot of underplaying the severity of abuse) and the relationship is 100% on my terms. I work in the same neighborhood as them but I maybe see them once every 2 months and call or text a few times a month. They always are so excited to hear from me and often mention they miss me and wish they saw me more, but I have 0 desire to do so. 

I’ve discussed the CC and cellphone bill with them before and they don’t mind paying it, and half the time I throw 150 or so their direction which they rebuke when I do, but ultimately accept it. But they do occasionally mention they’re frustrated about the my charges on the card (not the amount but what I’m using it for). The only reason they have access to any of this is because I had an identity theft issue a few years ago and one way to bring my credit back up was to attach an Amex as a co sign (I think that’s the correct term?) 

I’m concerned I’m abusing their guilt (even unintentionally) & allowing them to moderately fund my life style while I have no desire to further expand on our relationship.

bwtjv6	2019-06-04 20:21:47	AdOutAce	AITA for how I handled a situation where my coworker and I won an award?	"Hopefully a lighter discussion than this community's usual fare, but I'm feeling a little bad and want to see what other people think of the situation. Stakes are low either way so I'm fully prepared to be called an asshole, or some degree thereof.

To keep the situation brief and as vague as I'm comfortable with: I work as a writer, alongside a coworker that also works as a writer. My coworker is great and over the course of the last few years we've become friends. 

Recently, my coworker was recognized with an award for some work that she produced. The award is relatively prestigious within our industry, and her win was well-deserved. She was very excited about it, and made a big deal about it on social media, etc. Despite the fact that I think she can sometimes become preoccupied with validation, I was thrilled for her, and celebrated both with her and on her behalf.

Fast forward to last night. She texts me:

""Wait?? You won [same award] last year??""

So, at this point, I am genuinely confused. As many people in my life can attest, I don't have the sharpest memory. It occurred to me that I should just check, but I was preoccupied and instead responded:

""Huh? I did?""

Well, you might predict how this played out. My coworker did the research and informed me that my work did in fact win the same award (and once she pointed it out, I recalled the whole situation). She came in today as a mixture of embarrassed and deflated. It must look to her (and frankly, a bit to me in retrospect) like I humored her when she was proud of her accomplishment. She has since stashed the award in her desk when it was previously displayed as well. I haven't spoken to her about it, because frankly I don't see the good it would do, but I do feel like I could have handled things more gracefully.

Obviously it's not the end of the world either way. But I'm curious how far the community thinks a person should go on behalf of a friend to not burst a proverbial bubble? AITA, and is there a way I can mend her wounded ego a bit in the meantime?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bwtisc	2019-06-04 20:19:15		AITA for thinking my moms diet is bad for her?	"My mom is a Vegetarian, which i think is great, but i am worried about what she eats.  

She very often eats either a salad (vegetables, fruit, things like salad cucumber, avocado, tomato and often cheese) or drinks a smoothie for lunch or dinner or both, or she just eats sandwiches or something similar.  

Ever since she became a vegetarian 5 years ago, she has gotten a lot skinnier than she ever was before, and to be honest at times she has looked underweight and i’ve even told her “mom you look very skinny, are you okey?” Because i got worried. She doesn’t look extremely underweight during those periods, but she does look quite malnourished and slightly underweight, it’s hard to explain.  

She works out and overall she is healthy when she doesn’t have her “skinny” periods, but i am worried about what she eats. I love eating healthy so nutrition is very important to me, and i know that drinking smoothies for days or eating salads (i am also aware that salads are healthy, but they should not be eaten for days straight) is bad and not enough food for you.  

Today we booked a trip to Italy, and since we want to save as much money as possible we plan to buy food and cook it at our apartment and only eat at restaurants a few times . We were talking about what food we would buy when my mom told me she wants to eat salad everyday. And considering everything we are going to do which is hiking for full days and be very active, i said something like “i don’t think salad is good to eat with how much we are going to walk, and eating that everyday seems a bit weird and very boring” and my mom got really angry at me. She said things like “i have many things in my salads” “why do you care about what i eat, i know what’s good for me” and i tried to explain to her how eating salad everyday will probably not be enough calories and energy for the day, but she refuses to listen to me. We have also had conversations about this before when i’ve seen her drink smoothies for days straight at least twice a day and i’ve told her it’s not good, but she doesn’t want to listen to me.

bwtgmh	2019-06-04 20:14:13		WIBTA if I expose my mom because she refuses to give me money?	"First off: I am 19 (f), my bro is 23 and we still live at home because we go to University. English is not my first language.

Alright so, as some of you might know today (4th of June) is Eid and you usually get some pocket money from your elders(grandparents, aunts, uncles etc.)

This year, as usual, my grandma is sweet enough to give me and my brother each 100€. However, yesterday I found out that my mother is refusing to give me the money this time around because I ''can't control myself''. Now, I don't work but because I go to Uni I get a monthly student loan. I saved up most of the money since I still live at home and decided to treat myself to seem items I always wanted (e.g. I got a Nintendo Switch, a new drawing tablet etc.) This seriously pissed off my mom because she thinks I am wasting my money on ''consoles and games'' when I should be studying for Uni. TBH, those things really weren't necessary but I wanted a Switch to play Pokemon (and hopefully Animal Crossing) when they come out. Respectfully, I told her that I think it's unfair for her to keep my money but she refuses to give it to me. Quick note: My mother has access to my grandparents bank stuff bc she overlooks their finances since they live in another country.

Now here's the assholish part: I found out a couple months ago that my grandma has actually been giving my brother about 200€ every Month but my mother KEEPS that money from him for basically the same reasons as mine (he can't controll himself and will spend it all right away) when I overheard their conversation on the phone. My mother firmly told me not to tell my brother anything. My brother keeps asking me for loans (which he does pay back!) but I feel bad that he actually has a fund of his own that he has no idea about.

When I heard that my mother refuses to give me my Eid money the thought crossed my mind of just telling my brother about the funds that she's keeping from him in hopes of us both getting our money.

bwtfiq	2019-06-04 20:11:32		AITA for inviting a friend's(24M) ex(20F) to my birthday?	"Prepare to be underwhelmed.

I worked with a guy who became a good friend of mine. He was a laid back, intelligent stoner, that liked to game and keep his head down. His girlfriend, however, was 4 years younger than him. She was very green and doe-eyed, and she seemed genuinely in love with him (I found it creepy that they started dating when she was 14 and he was 18). The problem was that she was very outgoing, ambitious and driven, whereas he worked in a bookstore, didn't drive, and spent majority of his income on weed and games. Their relationship had survived because her being in high school limited her expectations of him.

Jump to 2019; My friendship with this girl was always through my friend (though I genuinely like her and looked out for her) and after they attended a brunch at my house she randomly reached out to me and asked me to be a sounding board for her and her relationship issues. She shared a lot of disappointing things about the way my friend had treated her these past few years, and I could tell that she was hoping I would chime in with justifications or excuses for why he would do or act a certain way, but the only thing I could offer her was advice on how to state what she needs, and give him the option to stay or go. Honestly, she needed to leave him; he was dragging her down and controlling her. This girl is full of light and wonder, and her boyfriend openly mocked and sneered at her optimism (and new found faith). They had been together for nearly 7 years, and he is in exactly the same place he had been in when they started dating - no education, no car, lives at home, no ambition, no social life.

So, a few weeks go by with no update, and the day I send out my birthday invitations is the day they happen to break up. My friend immediately accepts my invite, as does his (now) ex, and I realise he probably doesn't know I've invited her as well (I used to invite them together through him) and, when I told him, he was quick to ask me how I knew they'd broken up, and then reassured me it would be fine. His ex was elated with coming, mostly because she had met my friends at my brunch and got on with them (she is literally starving for human interaction).

Now some of our friends are saying I'm obligated to uninvite the ex, even though she's the one that'll enjoy the day more than my friend. I've also known her just as long as I've known my friend (though we weren't always as close) and I would have cut her off if she had wronged him, but that isn't the case. My friend denied his ex a social life for so many years, and I almost feel like he's only coming to my birthday to spite his ex or force himself into her space. I don't want to be one more person that dictates where she is and isn't allowed to go.

I honestly feel like this girl needs more friends in her life. AITA for still including her, even though she is now my friend's ex?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bwtfbh	2019-06-04 20:11:08	jhines57	AITA for saying I don't think my half-brother is my real brother?	"Back story: I'm a 24 yo male, I have 2 older half-brothers, my parents divorced when I was a senior in highschool. At first I chose to split my time 50/50 with both parents, but over time I've spent less and less time with my father because he's narcissistic. 


So anyways, on to the story. About a year ago I was extremely depressed (still am, but doing better) and decided to make some life changes which included quitting my job. Afterwards I had a really hard time trying to motivate myself to find work again or  even just get out of bed. My dad decided to text me one day saying I'm being a lazy baby and I just need to man up and quit faking my depression. After this I went no contact with him for about a year. During this period he would regularly call me or text me when he was drunk/sad/angry and berate me or try to guilt me into seeing him again with different threats and pleas. One of these was telling me that my oldest brother feels like I'm punishing him too for stuff my dad did (classic narcissist right?) since I was avoiding that side of the family and didn't attend any holiday get togethers. After hearing this a couple of different times I finally snapped and told him ""he's not my fucking brother, he's a stranger that you've only recently tried to force into my life"". The reason I said this is because my oldest brother hasn't been in my life for most of it. My dad claims he didn't even know his kid existed until he was 10 years old and the mother called my dad to try and start getting child support. At this point I was about 2. For the next 2-3 summers he came to stay with us until him and my other brother got in a bad fight and my mom didn't want him back for the summers anymore. From that time until he was an adult I hardly ever saw my oldest brother. Often with years inbetween visits. Once he was an adult he cut contact with my dad for years. He's recently started coming around my dad again the last few years, and shows up for Christmas and stuff for my dad's side of the family's get togethers.



My dad eventually told my brother I said this about him and he's apparently pretty upset about it. But I just don't see him as actual family. He's never been a part of my life growing up and I know absolutely nothing about him and he knows nothing about me. Hell, I didn't even know his last name until he added me on Facebook a few years back. So, AITA for saying my half-brother isn't really my brother?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Even in the (many) cases where I’ve said “you know grandma I’m not sure that’s really my style,” she’s still makes me keep it in case I change my mind, then guilts me anyway when I see her again regardless. Now I’m trying to clear out my clothes and I feel like I can’t give away any of her clothes without it being a slap in the face to her, so now my closet is like 20% stuff I would wear, 80% stuff I don’t want to wear.

"Last year I ended a relationship with a man who had 50/50 custody of two teenage daughters. We dated for a few years and I was very close to his girls. They have a good relationship with their mom but due to her strict religious beliefs (the dad isn’t religious)they don’t always feel like they can go to her. I took the role of a trustworthy aunt, doing my best to not step on any parental toes. Also, I do not have any children and this is a first time I’ve been in a role model position. My own relationship with their mom was rocky. My ex and her had a nasty divorce and she didn’t like me the second she knew about me. Despite her religious beliefs she has a reputation for being a hothead and jealous so we all did our best to not rock the boat. 
When the break up happened the girls and I were crushed. I made sure they knew I loved them and I’d still always be there for them for anything. Now, I already knew that one of the girls (16 years old, let’s call her Meg) had a secret boyfriend. Her dad knew a little bit about it but mom had no idea. I received a text from Meg saying she’d like to talk to me about something. I picked her up and she told me she lost her virginity. I didn’t know what to say. My first instinct was to flip and tell her she’s too young. But because I’m no longer a daily figure in their life I felt like I could only give advice and make sure she’s being responsible. I told her she can slow down and gave her the condom/ plan B lecture. 
Days passed and it was still heavy on my mind, so I told her it’d be best if she told her dad and get on birth control. I coached her on how to approach her dad with this. She followed through and he took it pretty well. Despite her dad’s support she didn’t feel like she could tell her mom so she asked if I would take her to the doctor. Her dad waited in the lobby while we went in to the exam room. We explained to the doctor her situation and made sure her mother would never be contacted or find out. 
I feel okay about it. But there is  some creeping guilt there. If I was their mom I would want to know. I’ve been rationalizing by saying at least one of her parents is involved and she is being responsible. 
I confided in a coworker who is a mom to teenagers and shares the same religion as Meg’s mom. She thinks I should inform their mom or have their dad tell her. 
I’m torn. Should i make sure her mom knows? I know her dad could go on ignorantly, never giving telling their mom a second thought. He doesn’t have great judgement and I’ve always been his moral compass. Plus, I know if their mom was to find out I was involved she’d rain hellfire on me. But is she wrong? Did I do my part or did I step out of bounds by being involved? It felt good to be confided in and I wanted to honor my promise of being there for her.
Like I said before, this is my first experience with kids and I don’t exactly know how to navigate this. My bottom line is whatever is best for the kids I’m willing to do."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwt40c	2019-06-04 19:45:50	scotty_doesntknow	AITA to tell my sister not to date?	"So, my sister has finally decided to separate from her husband.  Honestly, I’m ELATED for her as he’s extremely emotionally (and, I suspect, physically) abusive and it’s been a toxic situation for years.  She’s a SAHM of the last few years, but recently started a business that’s been very successful so far - so, my hope is she’ll be able to support herself without relying on my (soon to be former) BIL.  BIL makes a great income but I don’t trust him to do the right thing and may play games with finances once he accepts that the separation isn’t just a temporary thing.

The issue?  My sis only told BIL she wants a separation about two weeks ago.  He’s moved to the basement MIL suite, and isn’t home this week anyways because he’s off on a guy’s trip.  She’s made an offer on a new house, but they’re likely to still be living together for at least another month unless he proactively moves elsewhere (unlikely).

Tonight, she told me she’s going on a date with a guy she met through a local hobby club meetup.  I’m happy she’s feeling herself and hopefully able to move forward into better relationships once she’s away from her still-husband, but I’m concerned that it’s too early to start dating since she and her husband are technically still living together and only had the “separation” talk two weeks ago.  I’m also concerned it might have potential impact on future custody hearings, although she says there’s no way her two kids (4f and 6f) would know she’s was dating and she doesn’t intend to bring the guy around the kids (but might have him at the house while they’re away visiting at the MIL’s house overnight). 

She says I’m being an asshole and stressing her out for no reason, and after years of a shitty and abusive marriage she deserves to go out and date guys who’ll actually be nice to her.  I want her to live her best life and am so happy she’s making the change to get away from a toxic relationship, but for some reason it still makes me uncomfortable that it’s happening so soon after the separation and well before any formal divorce/custody arrangements.

bwt3n0	2019-06-04 19:45:02	FilmaNoire	AITA for Not Helping my GF's Little Sister Move Into her BF's Apt.	I'd like to put on the record my girlfriend and I  have moved twice now and asked her little sister for help and brunch/ concerts have been more important to her then helping us move.   When I found out they where moving in I offered to help two weeks in advance. The gf's little sister told me that she didn't need help that her boyfriend and her have it covered. The day they where supposed to be finished moving in ( The apt is in Mahattan) they invited us over for beers and pizza. When we get there only the boyfriends stuff was moved in. The GF's little sister rushed us downstairs and said we need to pick up some things from my old place. So we drive her  to her old place and the whole apt needed to be packed and moved out, Nothing was done.  I delivered  a few dressers and clothes and said I was done. They then told me that they need me to pick up a couch. I told them I can't and next time to give me 24/hr notice so I could clear out my car. And also rent a Uhaul if your moving out a whole apt. I'm asking because this started a fight with my girlfriend because they didn't pick up the couch they let that one go and they are waiting on me to free up my schedule to pick up another couch on Craigslist. Which I said I'm not doing it rent a Uhaul. Rant done.	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwt1zx	2019-06-04 19:41:24		AITA for filing a complaint against a bus driver?	"So today I took the bus home from a job interview. As I got on the bus I put my money in the terminal. I mistakenly put in $1.50 instead of $1.60. Cause I thought that was the bus fair cost.

 As I walked to my seat the driver goes ""Sir. SIIIRRRR."" I turned around and asked if he was talking to me and he goes ""How long of a bus trip are you taking?"" I didn't understand the question so I gave him an inquisitive look. And he says, in an extremely condescending voice, ""a one way bus trip costs $1.60. You put in $1.50"" I told him I didn't know and he goes ""It's ALWAYS been $1.60"".


 So I put in an extra quarter and as I walked away I said under my breath ""K you don't have to be so rude about a dime"". He stands up and yells over the whole bus ""I DIDN'T THINK I WAS RUDE I THINK I WAS VERY HELPFUL. IF YOU'D LIKE I CAN SHOW THIS FOOTAGE TO MY BOSSES AND SEE WHAT THEY THINK"". So I just apologized cause I didn't want any further altercation. 

After I got off the bus I immediately called customer service at the bus station and reported the incident. I feel angry cause I was humiliated in front of everyone on the bus. Do you think I should have just kept my opinion to myself? And let the whole thing go? And do you think this is grounds for being refused service on the bus?

Anyways my good friend was getting married. She was best friends with another friend but they had a pretty big falling out during the wedding planning stages. Fast forward to wedding day I get a call from the woman’s mom saying she fell down the stairs and broke her neck. She also had a brain bleed and things did not look good. Her own mom told me she wasn’t going to make it through the next few hours. 

This was minutes before my friend that was getting married. I decided to not tell her obviously. After the ceremony her mom called again and told me she’s in surgery but things are not looking good. I wanted to tell my friend but that’s her wedding day and I didn’t want to ruin it. Before the wedding reception was over she is passed away. I still didn’t tell her. She found out and was hysterical. They had a falling out but still they were best friends for years. 


She found out I knew about it and she’s never talked to me again. It’s been two years. She didn’t even say anything to me at her celebration of life service. Honestly I didn’t tell her cause what she do? She was in surgery and couldn’t be visited."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwszog	2019-06-04 19:36:30	bbelena	AITA for standing up for myself and my coworker?	"The situation that happened today seemed to happen all at once. My boss and his son, the Next Boss, were in a side room, dealing with something that really upset Next Boss. Not sure what it was, but it has nothing to do with me or the coworker that was at the office this morning, about an hour into the shift.

&#x200B;

Then, we hear a car alarm going off. A dumpster has smashed into coworker's car, probably due to the rain and wind we've had this morning. My Boss asks where Coworker went. I said the dumpster hit her car. He says that all we (the employees) do is use him for his insurance policies (? not sure how) and immediately goes out there. He then starts screaming at my coworker that ***SHE*** should have moved the dumpster this morning. Now, she and I only do office work, so we are never in the back by the garage, other than parking.

&#x200B;

I raise my voice, mostly to defend her, and say that he shouldn't be blaming her or me for not seeing the dumpster. We have no reason to think about the dumpster. He continues screaming at her, berating her, I say he's uncalled for and out of line.

&#x200B;

We all go into the office. His son, New Boss, is in the office. I tell New Boss that I am sick of this treatment (Boss makes me or one of my other coworkers cry at least every other day due to his vitriol). New Boss just kinda smiles at me, like he doesn't know what to say. I ask him if he would like to work in an environment like this, and he just can't find words. Then, I say that his dad is WRONG for how he expects us to move the dumpster when we didn't even know it could move! He says I am in the wrong and his dad is not wrong. Then, he kind of changes to ""well, we're all wrong here..."" I say that if he is seriously going to act like his dad is not wrong for making people cry and blaming others, then I will leave for the day because I am beyond livid. He says fine, leave (with that smirk on his face). So I do.

&#x200B;

My coworker begs me to stay as I get into my car and eventually convinces me to come back inside. We are stopped outside of the building when Boss comes at me, screaming, pointing fingers, and getting in my face tell me to leave because I shouldn't have ""gotten in the middle"" and ""given New Boss an ultimatum."" My coworker starts crying again, New Boss just stands there. I leave.

&#x200B;

I am seething because the obvious dad/son relationship trumps all, apparently. We are pulled around, schedules changed, hours cut, all the time! My boss makes someone cry every other day, minimum.

&#x200B;

My coworker texted me and said my boss said I am not fired, but how can I go back when New Boss was so nasty, just like his father? He has always been okay with me, but now I am sure if I go to work tomorrow, it will be even more unbearable.

&#x200B;

He had his newly bought knife out trying to cut his pants, and doesnt have good control over it yet. The dog is not even a year and we had just got home so he was excited to see us and was jumping on us a little bit. Instead of stop cutting his pants, he screamed at the dog and kicked him with his steel toed boots away from him. 

He proceeded to yell at me he didn't the dog, and its better than it being cut. I told him he did, and you don't do that. I out the dog in its owners room, and he asked why it was so scared, so I told him. He messaged our group to not kick his dog, so the friend went downstairs screaming he didn't kick his dog and at least he didn't cut him. Then ran upstairs screaming ""I guess everything is my fault!"" 

I've been noticing him having anger issues as well lately and he's more aggressive towards animals that aren't his. He uses more force than necessary to get them to stop or to shove them away. He punched his car and dented it  cause he couldn't find a glove that he would get at work for free. He dropped his phone going into the house so he kicked the door hard. I've yelled at him for the kick to the door and the dog incident, and I can't help but think am I the asshole and should I have handled that differently?

bwszgf	2019-06-04 19:36:04	DiscountDangles	AITA For quitting my job and leaving my boss scrambling because of an Air Force Veteran (US)? WIBTA for reporting?	"So to preface, I've been at the company for just over 90 days. It's a national security company and I am stationed at the 4th largest mall of my state. We are not allowed to have firearms but we do have OC spray and handcuffs. It is CLEARLY stated that even having a firearm in your vehicle on property is against the law and you will be fired immediately and criminally charged. 
Now this is where it gets interesting, there is an individual (let's call him Rob). Rob was allegedly Injured from an IED in a hummer on one of his tours. Despite him changing his story every time we ask him, he still claims to be a veteran and is injured physically and mentally. My boss claims he brought the paperwork for it. Over the course of his month of employment so far, he is usually at dispatch because""it hurts too much to walk"". I have been (since his employment) in two fights where I am outnumbered either 4:1 and 9:1. Both times he failed to send me any help, and when I was at a jewelry store on campus last week, there was an armed robbery where he did not log a single thing I called out. A huge responsibility at dispatch is to listen to local police scanners as well as answer phone calls for emergencies. A few instances have happened where he failed to get the required info (like the location of a Motor Vehicle Accident with possible injury), etc. All of my supervisors are sick of him and we all have written formal complaints and write-ups. 
That mixed with the behavior issues, he is just very unpleasant to work with and I genuinely fear for my safety and of my other officers.
Three days ago, it was around midnight so we only had 4 officers there and no supervisor. I was the senior officer so I was left in charge. As I went to hover over Rob to check on his work, I noticed the butt and magazine of a firearm in his waistline sticking out. (It is the same gun I have at home.) I asked him about it and asked if that was the specific firearm I thought it was. He revealed to me that I was the first one to notice and he also stated that he has had it everyday since week one. Naturally I stepped outside a few minutes later to report it to my direct superiour. 
I came into work today to realize he not only got caught with it again today, (and lied about it) but still has a job there. I expressed my concerns (privately) with my boss, to only be met with disrespect. I simply said I didn't feel safe, I didn't even get to explain the other issues. She walked outside yelling at me ( I'm guessing to go smoke, she always does that when something upsets her) and I called a new officer into the break room to watch me so I'd have a witness incase they claim I stole anything.

AITA for quitting and leaving her understaffed even more? We typically need around 16 staff hired and we just lost 7 in one week. She now only has 7 staff.

bwsyk8	2019-06-04 19:34:18	bluegradient808	AITA if I listen to my parents and don't give my ex half of our camping gear?	"About 6 months ago my girlfriend of 7 years and I broke up and I let her keep our dog, the apartment we rented together (I paid 90% of the rent the entire time we lived there), and all the furniture, tv, etc. The only thing I left with were personal belongings and our Instant Pot (lol). I left her it because I honestly still loved her, and I just wanted it to be over with so I could move on. Also, her moving back with her parents (drug addicts) was out of the question. So I temporarily moved back in with mine.

The reason we broke up was that she told me she didn't love me anymore, but I later found out she had been cheating on me with this guy for about 3 weeks before we broke up. I even found out she was with him the night my grandpa passed away in hospice (I had asked her to come, but she refused to visit at all). She got mad at me when she wasn't invited to the funeral. 

I'm still a little upset about it, but I'm picking up the pieces up and getting on with my life.

Anyways, we have about $2000 worth of camping stuff that we had been keeping with my parents. All my friends and family are livid that I let her keep the apartment, dog, furniture, etc. without putting up a fight. Honestly I don't see their point of view. 

I agreed over the phone to give my ex half the camping stuff, but on a later phone call, after a heated argument, I told her I wouldn't be giving her any of it. She exploded and threatened me with a bunch of stuff, including spilling all my secrets on social media, and stealing my mail. After things settled down a bit, I thought it over and decided I would still give it to her, because the situation was just going to get worse if I didn't.

I just feel like giving her the camping stuff so she'll be out of my life, but my parents refuse to let me go into the attic to get it. They say that it's ""their property since it's in their house"", and they're pissed that my ex threatened me and also that I gave her everything after the breakup.

My parents say they're going to tell her she's getting nothing. I honestly think they're just taking their anger out on my ex. I don't like her either, but she's incredibly stubborn and is the type of person to go around telling everyone I stole her camping gear and am ""terrorizing"" her.

I know this may seem like a NTA situation, but I feel like it's more complicated than that. 

I (20f) work in a mostly Male dominated field as a sort of secretary. I have this one coworker (30ish?) who, when he sees me, constantly calls me ""pretty lady"", ""beautiful"", and ""sweetie"" even though he knows I have a boyfriend. He has also made some passes at me, while still knowing I am in a serious relationship of almost 4 years.

My problem is that I know if I tell my boss, he could get in some serious trouble, possible even lose his job. Since this is a Male Dominated field, they take ""sexual harrassment"" very seriously, if you could even call if that. I don't want him to get in too much trouble, or fired.

So Reddit, WIBTA if I told my supervisor that one of my coworkers is making me uncomfortable, even if it means risking his job?

EDIT:

I have not directly confronted him about his yet, because I am afraid he will take my feelings about this the wrong way and tell other people in the office and I will be labeled a bitch.

bwsxfd	2019-06-04 19:31:50	WMP_BSS	AITA for not wanting to spend Father's Day with my father in law?	"My father died a while ago. I'm not an overly emotional person but the day always has a weird feel to it. Ever since I've been married I've had the feeling my wife has had the unspoken feeling that since I don't have a father I'm completely available/obligated to spend the day with her father. The thing is, I don't really like her father. He's ok.... not the worst guy. But he's a bit of a know it all, and even more annoyingly loves to tell you what to do. This despite the fact that my wife and I have taken the opposite of his advice on quite a few occasions and it has worked out great for us. This doesn't prevent him from throwing his two cents in the next time. I feel like he's also tried to ""take me under his wing"", thinking he's doing me a favor since I don't have a father. Truth is he and my father were opposites, and I don't need or want a father replacement.

So another Father's Day is approaching and I just got the text ""are you available to celebrate Father's Day on such and such a date."" AITA for being resentful that my wife puts me in this position? Why doesn't she just plan to spend the day with her father without me being involved? He's not my father.

Edit: Thanks for those who lost parents commenting.... I truly feel like you don't get it unless you've lost a parent. I've always been very stoic about my father dying. Like I said, I'm just not one to show a lot of emotion. But something about the day is weird. I think because I don't show emotion my wife tends to think it doesn't bother me and I think she's therefore like ""Oh good, now we don't have to split time on father's day and you can spend it all with my father."" It does cause resentment, which on a rational level I know doesn't make sense, but other people who commented here seem to have some of the same feelings. So thanks for validating me!"

bwsx1u	2019-06-04 19:31:04	zb0p	AITA for telling my friend that I liked her back even though she has a boyfriend?	"I have a very close friend, who happens to be a girl, in my class. We dated a year ago, but decided to call it quits and just be friends. She now has had a boyfriend for over a year, and he is a genuinely good guy. I’m friends with him, but not nearly as close as I am with his girlfriend. 

Whenever she was angry at her boyfriend or they had some form of a dispute, she would hang out with me. This was confusing because I couldn’t decide whether she still had feelings for me or she just wanted to get back at her boyfriend. I decided it was most likely the second option and that I was being too egotistical about it, because there was no way she could like me. She and her boyfriend were inseparable and almost gross to look at in public. Everyone knows a couple like this. So I figured, there was no way in hell she could like me. 

Flash forward to about a week ago. I was at a party with at least half of my class at the lake. I hadn’t seen my girl friend the whole night, so I figured she was just with her boyfriend like usual. However, while I was talking to a girl I met there, as one does at a party, out of nowhere my girl friend shows up and starts a new conversation with me and ignores the girl I was just introducing myself to. And before I knew it, she grabbed my arm and asked if I wanted to take some pictures together. I consented, and after some more talking, she gave me a hug and we went our separate ways back to our own homes. 

I figured maybe she just had a little strife with her boyfriend and that was why she was being affectionate towards me, which did not make me feel very well, but I was used to it. That same night, however, she Snapchats me and says, “Hey.” 
So I answer and ask, “What’s up? Do you need anything?”
My girl friend then responds with, “I think I might like you.” 

She continued and said that when she saw me talking to the girl I was introducing myself to, she felt jealous of her. I said ok, but what do we do now? She then asked if I liked her, and I said I might. My girl friend was now under the impression that I liked her, but she still has a boyfriend and hasn’t told him anything. 

She told me that I could not tell anyone or else she jeopardizes her relationship with her boyfriend, but I was confused because she like two guys at the same time and could not choose. I told her to think about it for a week and see if she still had feelings for me. 

After thinking over the situation heavily, two days later I decided to call her boyfriend and tell him everything. I felt awful for him because he is a great guy and does not deserve something like this to happen. My girl friend then called me and knew that I had told him somehow. Two words, she told me, “Fuck you.” 

Her boyfriend thanked me for my honesty; my girl friend blocked my number.

My mom met my stepfather when I was apx 13. Cue 2 years of him cheating on his current wife with my mom until he finally left her and moved in with us. Things were very rocky because of this until I finished high school. My brother moved in with my dad when he turned 18, and I did the same, largely because my mom and her husband left for the other side of the country the moment I turned 18 and child support stopped. 

About every other year in highschool my mom would flip her lid when we didn't get him anything for fathers day. It was like she'd forget our stance every other year. That 1. We met him when we were teenagers, under not good circumstances, and he is not a father figure to us. 2. It would hurt the feelings of our own father who raised us and gave everything to us that he could. 3. He has his own kids. Yes they don't speak to him, but that's because he cheated on their mother and he dug that hole himself. We never got him a fathers day present and it resulted in several giant blow ups when I was a teen.

After my mom moved away we all became pretty cordial and we see her 1-2 times a year and catch up once a month or so. My stepfather actually helped me out quite a bit with fixing crappy cars while I was in college and we're on friendly terms now when I visit my mom. 

The fathers day issue has not come up in the 7 years since I turned 18. Until now, for some reason. She's suddenly gotten it into her head again, that we must hate him and hate her happiness and we're damaging her relationship. To my knowledge he's never cared about this issue much. I told her that I still think its inappropriate. It would still hurt my fathers feelings, he's still not a father figure despite us being friendly now. So far my brother agrees with me but is considering getting him something to keep the peace.  So am I the asshole here?"		1	0

I thought that she would do this for me because we love each other a lot and she said she would do whatever I needed for the wedding. However, she told me that she still didn't want to wear a dress. She said if it's something I absolutely want then she would do it, but she wanted me to know how apprehensive and uncomfortable it made her.

So this happened today but I’m going to provide a little context. I had been talking to this girl for a while we’ll call Abby. Abby and I had gone to homecoming at my school and hung out on Halloween and a few times in between, usually with friends as well. Eventually, she broke it off with me because she didn’t have time for a relationship because of how busy she was. Her schedule became available and she started talking to my friend, (we’ll call Kyle) they hit it off pretty well and spent time together for a while but she lost feelings.

Last weekend I found out she got really drunk with her friends and started spouting about how she didn’t like Kyle and wanted to get back with me. The night after her friends hmu and asked if I would think about getting back with her, I did and said yes, but she hadn’t broken it off with him yet. So we agreed we wouldn’t start talking until the summer after she broke it off with him to spare his feelings and not make it seem like she dropped him for me.

I had stupidly told one of my friends (we’ll call jack, short for jack ass) after telling him to keep it secret because I wanted to spare Kyle’s feelings. Of course, the second jack gets he tells Kyle why Abby broke things off. Now Kyle hates me and hasn’t said a word since, he’s just been dead eyeing me all day and will probably try to fight me. So Reddit AITA?

Edit: we’re all good all of us made up Abby might be mad at me though but I can deal.

Edit: forgot to add that before she went out with him he asked me if it was ok I said it was fine. Makes me more of an asshole I now realize, but gotta let y’all know."	Asshole	0	0

bwsu11	2019-06-04 19:24:29		AITA for not going to wash my car with my Dad while he’s dedicating a lot of time to driving me?	"Backstory: Im a high school student who got a summer internship at a local college. Its 2-3 days a week and about 8 hours each time. My dad doesn’t trust me to drive there so he’s taking me and spending the whole 8 hours in town each time as he doesn’t think it’s worth driving the 40 minutes back. I’ve pushed to drive myself so his time isn’t wasted but he’s the one who pushed for this situation.

The internship starts tomorrow and before going I need to get some important software and install another operating system on my laptop. I haven’t been able to do this yet as my laptop came back from a repair center 2 days ago and have been busy with work and errands since then. I planned on doing it today but my dad requested that I spend 2-3 hours cleaning and waxing our cars. I asked if I could do it Thursday instead as I need to get the software. He responded by calling me spoiled and exclaiming that he’s going to be spending all this time driving me yet I can’t dedicate a few hours at his whim to clean the cars.

We had plans for a real date the next day but she hit me with that late night ""WYD?"" so I invited her to my place. When she arrived she was looking a few years past her photos and I was not exactly stoked. The classic self-catfish where it's still the same person but many years or pounds ago! Like the typical horny guy I am, I still wanted to get my nut so I let her in, opened a bottle of wine, and took a forhims (I wasn't super attracted to her and I didn't want any performance issues) to set the mood. She literally cried and complained about her home life and parents the entire time we were hanging, she was like an adult baby. I moved us to my bedroom and we proceeded to fuck 3x, each time I used a small bathroom towel to take off the condom and clean my dick. 3 session, 3 loads worth of cum clean up. She was freaking out the entire night, having crying and screaming episodes, I was scared at times. In the morning when she was leaving, she wanted to wash her face and get the makeup off. She hollered from the bathroom for a clean washcloth or rag, which I did not have. Then hilarity ensued, at least for me. I looked at my cum rag, smiled, and eagerly brought it to this girl to wipe all over her face, she was none the wiser. I laughed a bit too much after she left and shared the details with my female roommate, she also found pleasure in it! Anyways, sorry crazy Tinder girl!"		1	0
bwstho	2019-06-04 19:23:19		AITA for not eating left out food my aunt brought me?	"I have emetophobia, which is the fear of vomiting. I’m very cautious when it comes to what I eat, as I have a big fear of food poisoning, and I often can’t eat at home because my aunt often doesn’t put food up in time and leaves it out for a couple hours. My aunt knows about my fear, but she doesn’t care. As a matter of fact, she’s mocked me for having it before, as well as rolled her eyes at me for having panic attacks in the past over feeling sick. 

Today, she came home after dropping my cousin off at college. She brought McDonald’s for me and my younger sister. My sister was awake in the living room, while I was still sleeping in my bed. When I finally woke up, my sister told me our aunt brought me an Egg McMuffin, and I asked, out of impulse, how long it’s been out. My sister said, “I don’t know. Our aunt’s been home for a while now though.” This automatically triggered a small panic attack in me. 

I got to the food, looked at it, and kept wondering if I should eat it or throw it away. My aunt walks into the dining room, and I ask her what time she got home. She already knew where I was coming from when I asked this, as she responded in a very annoyed tone and said, “8.” It was 11:30 AM when I looked at the clock, so it’s been 3 hours now. I figured at this point in time, the food definitely has perished, since the general rule is not let it sit out past 2 hours. 

She immediately got angry at me and said, “What’s wrong? You think I’d let you get sick? You’re ridiculous,” followed by, “I know how panicky you get over this, but this needs to stop,” and then she grabbed the food and threw it in the trash, and said, “I’m not buying you food ever again.” 

I felt bad for not eating it, but at the same time, I don’t understand why nobody could be bothered to put my food up in the fridge while I was asleep. They both knew I was, and I always put their food in the fridge if I know they’re sleeping. Neither of them were doing anything important at that moment. But I don’t know.

I do appreciate my aunt’s gesture though. I always thank you to her when she brings us stuff, and this time wasn’t any different. I just didn’t want to eat it because I knew the risk."		1	0

They both just turned 15 and are NOT emotionally mature enough for sex. To be clear, I’ve had the talk with them several times, and (to my wife’s request) we have a condom drawer that we replace/refill every couple months because ultimately, if my kids disobey me, I rather they do it safely.

&#x200B;

That being said, my son is definitely a late bloomer. He actually might be gay, I’m not sure, but he’s definitely not interested in girls at the moment.

&#x200B;

My daughter on the other hand is a different story; her phone is always blowing up with snapchats and text messages from people with male names (I don’t read their messages; I just see the name pop up on her home screen) and she’s always talking about what guys are cute or whatever. I think she’s too young to be talking to all these different guys; but I digress.

&#x200B;

Last week, she invited some guy to her room while we were home. I thought it was weird and brought up to my wife and she didn’t really think anything of it. I came home today and my wife said a guy was over again, so I went upstairs and opened the door to the two of them making out with no shirts on. She tried to scream at me to get out and got mad how I didn’t knock and I told her it was MY house and that what the hell is she doing upstairs with a guy. I told the dude to leave and he was like a deer in headlights and ran. I told her that she’s WAY to be young to be having guys over and for now on, she’s only to hang out in the basement with the door open (of which, I can pretty much hear everything because I work from home one floor above in the kitchen. The basement also has a TV so it's not like they'd have nothing to do). She tried to complain and I told her I’m the parent, what I say goes, end of discussion.

&#x200B;

I talked to my wife about it later and she didn’t completely oppose the basement idea, but maintained that she’s a high schooler now and I can’t stop her from having sex. Which I get, she’s a teenager, I used be one too; if they REALLY want it, they will find a way, but that way will NOT be a free pass in my house. My wife’s parents were very sexually open, so her parents had 0 problem letting her bring boyfriends over at 13, but she was also taken advantage of by older, manipulative guys, as a result of this openness so she understood my POV.

&#x200B;

My daughter is still pissed at me, saying I’m treating her like she’s a kid (which I am, because she is). I’m normally the laidback parent so this is the first time this has happened to me. I don’t THINK I’m being unreasonable, but I’m open to criticism IF I am. Wanted to get an objective POV.

&#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to mention that she can also only bring home guys when I'm home. We have a home security system that takes pictures/videos when someone enters the house, so I'm not too worried about her doing it behind my back. I'll also go down there randomly/periodically when one IS over."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwsqbq	2019-06-04 19:16:07	legoboy678	"AITA for snitching on a ""friend?"""	" 

Recently at school, I reported a “friend” to the counselor because he kept calling me gay and harassing me. I am a straight guy and dislike when people call me gay because I had long hair. This started a few months ago in March during an english project because he thought I wasn’t doing enough work writing the story. I was mostly editing the text because that is what I am better at doing. Multiple times he put a code in binary saying that “he’s so gay I can't even put it in regular text,” among other things similar to that. In some parts of the story while describing something he would homosexual man or something similar and proceed to put a comment with my name on that text. Other times he would go through the text highlighting individual letters to say I’m gay. That was during that project a few months ago.

A few weeks go by of him just being a douche like kicking my locker shut and bothering me in class. To mitigate I’ve had to hold my locker open with my foot and move to a different part of the class. Slowly cutting him out worked until he got in an argument with one of his teachers resulting in him having to switch classes. That class he got moved to, I was already in. From the first day, he was in he would take my stuff and move it out of my seat across the room. After doing that he would either sit in the chair or have someone else sit there. The teacher really didn’t do much about that over the course of about 5 weeks. I just gave up and moved somewhere else in the room.

Later on in May after spring break he decided to unplug my mouse and rip it out of my hand. Being the stubborn guy I am I didn’t let him take it easily causing it to break at the cord. My anger almost caused me to just slap him but I knew that I would get destroyed just because of how much bigger he is than me. I was told I would get a new mouse. It took a month for him to get it to me. With a nice quote of; “Here’s your mouse, dipshit.” I at least got my mouse back.

While waiting for him to get me a new mouse I had my hair shaved off to make a wig as a reward to a local cub scout pack for selling their popcorn goal. The difference between my almost 3-foot long hair and about 2-inch hair was surprising for a lot. That also got a lot of comments on how I look more lesbian than one of the tomboyish girls. Most of those comments came from that same guy, who also said; “You look more lesbian now than you did with long hair.”

At that point, I had enough and just emailed the counselor about the issue, with a document of all the things he said during the english project. After talking with the counselor I was told that it could be a case of bullying and he could get suspended for a few days. Earlier today he talked with the counselor and got lunch detention for it. I felt like that wasn’t enough punishment but my friends are saying I was an asshole about it. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwsotl	2019-06-04 19:12:51	firstpullup	AITA If I told my GF my parents won't go to her parents home?	"Note: Both my girlfriend and I live with our parents.

  
Recently, my parents  decided to get a doggo, and he's a great pup, everyone loves him, etc. I told my GF about this, and her response was that ""my parents will not come to your parents home if you have a dog."" Now, her family (parents, sisters, nephew, niece) seem to have some sort of major hate of pets in general.  It's to the point that they do not visit  her father's brother (because he has dogs) at his home, and either invite him over, or go to a restaurant. They say that it's ""unclean, and unsanitary"" to have a dog. One other thing from her personal behaviour that changed, is whenever we meet she asks me whether I touched the dog/if my hands are clean, which is starting to annoy me now.  I told my GF that perhaps if her parents would be coming over, we could just let a friend dogsit the pup for the day, but she said that just the fact that there was a dog there would be too much for them. 

&#x200B;

One thing to note is that this isn't a ""now"" problem, its something a bit (\~1 year) into the future. The only time they'd come over is when we'd be discussing engagement plans  (at that point, both parents would be meeting)\*\*

&#x200B;

\*\* this is a cultural thing, when engagements are considered, each parent visits the others family

&#x200B;

Her telling me that her parents would not come to my home,  I feel didn't sit right with me. I felt that if her parents couldn't do my parents the respect of coming to their house over a dog, then I would not make my parents do the same, and IMO this whole situation is overblown, and they're over reacting over a dog. 

&#x200B;

AITA for refusing to make my parents go to my SO's home, if hers refuse to do the same? Or am I overreacting, and should consider her parents position on the situation first? Or that I'm even being silly for nitpicking about a situation so far into the future with so many variables?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bwsojn	2019-06-04 19:12:10	samandr16	AITA For Calling Someone Out Who Accused My Sister of Drug Abuse?	"Okay little background here, at my school there is a very prevalent drug abuse problem, mainly pills. Last night I was studying with a group and the topic came up because one of my classmates, let's call her Kasey, mentioned how one of her friends was addicted, I brought up the fact that the pills are laced and could kill people and that one of my sister's close friends had overdosed, Kasey responded by acknowledging who my sister's friend was who overdosed and saying her name. She then blatantly said ""oh yeah your sister's addicted to them too"" I didn't believe her at first but she kept giving me really specific details such as saying she knew the dealer really well and knew who was buying the pills, she told me my sister, another friend, and the friend who had overdosed all bought pills together. Then she told me that what I had heard about my sister's friend's overdose was incorrect (just minor details such as where she was/how much she took/ etc). I got angry and left to go confront my sister, ready to tell our parents and get her in a lot of trouble. I know my sister is a smart person and would never do anything but the evidence was staggering and she had come into my room earlier that day in a weird mood, even saying so herself that she was ""feeling weirdly happy"". When I talked to her all of my doubts in her faded. She told me how sickened she was by her friend's actions and had never even been in the same room when they took pills. She has so much to lose academically and she's involved in sports as well, a drug problem or even a drug rumor could really hurt her reputation and chances at going to a good college. After learning this I immediately texted Kasey. I told her that whatever she heard was false and that my sister had never taken the pills. She responded, ""Okay haha"". I asked her repeatedly to tell me who told her the lies but she wouldn't tell me, she said: ""I'm not going to reveal my sources you're just going to have to deal with it."" I was very angry not only that she wouldn't tell me who started the rumor so I could attempt to stop a very serious and potentially hurtful rumor but that she had told our study group in the first place and helped spread the rumor. When she stopped responding to my texts I texted one of our mutual friends and asked if she knew who told Kasey the false rumors about my sister but she didn't know. I then texted in our study group chat and took the opportunity to set the record straight about my sister and tell them how Kasey wasn't helping me to stop a rumor she helped to spread.  Instead she shrugs off all blame and is acting like I am the bad guy. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwso48	2019-06-04 19:11:10	pilihayden01	AITA for not wanting my parents to know that my boyfriend is Latino	" [UPDATE ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bx6epc/update_aita_for_not_wanting_my_parents_to_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

My boyfriend was born in America but his parents are from Argentina, and he speaks Spanish, eats traditional culture and has various traditions from Argentina. But he is very light skin ( as his ancestors are from Europe ) and his name is Benjamin. So it isn’t very obvious that he is a Latino except that you hear him speaking Spanish.

Now, I don’t have a problem with him beign a Latino but my parents are very conservative. The “ all Latinos are criminals “ type of conservative. My brother once had an “exotic” girlfriend and my parents didn’t like it at all. So  when we decided that it was time to him to met my parents, I told him to hide that he was Latino. He was alright with that.

Once we were having dinner with my parents they ask about his last name ( Rossi ) and he explained that his grandparents were from Italy. My father, beign like he is, said “ for a moment I thought you were an illegal “ ( because for him all Latinos are illegals ). Then my mother followed with another comment and my father with another and they basically started insulting all Latinos. I could see my boyfriend being really uncomfortable, specially when my father ask him if he agreed with them. Lather that night, when we had left my parent’s house he told me that he wasn’t going to hide his ethnicity any longer, that he felt insulted.
I understand my boyfriend but my parents love him. And I don’t want to sacrifice my relationship with them because of my boyfriend, but I don’t want to left him either. I think that he should hide it a little longer at lest until they accept him or once we are already living together or something.

UPDATE:

After all your comments I saw it. I was being a horrible person and i was also being racist when I tried to defend my parents. I wanted to fix things. First I apologize with my boyfriend, he said it was okay and not my fault, although I am not sure anymore if he is being honest and not lying so that I don’t feel bad. And then the hard part, telling my parents. 
 
I decided to go alone.I had started this mess and I had to fix it, and I knew it wasn’t going to be nice so i didn’t want my boyfriend to also go through this. I went for lunch with my parents. After we finished we were talking. I started with “hey did you liked Benjamin?”, they did like him. Then I told them that I needed to tell them something, they looked me directly in the eyes probably thinking I was pregnant or something. And then I told them. I was prepared for shouting, but no, It was only silence. After a couple of minutes my dad said “ so you date one of those..” and continue with a lot of insults. My mother tried to convince me to dump him, I told them “ didn’t you like him? He didn’t seem like a nice guy?, but then my father went about how they always seem nice when you meet them but then they become into monsters.

The discussion when for a couple of minutes, me trying to let them see that he was a nice person and then ignoring me and continuing with their insults. I simply left. I feel like shit now, for what I did and for what I have now done. My parents are racist, but i love them, they raised me and give me a lot of good memories. But I also love my boyfriend and I decided i prefer keeping my relationship with him. I don’t know why Amy parents going to do, not talk to me ever, or talk to me but only to insult him. But I did it, it didn’t fix what i did but at lest I feel a little bit better.

Thanks for all the people that respond to my post. I know a lot of you aren’t going to forgive me and are going to call me a racist. But at lest you help me see what I did wrong and how I was hurting my boyfriend."	Asshole	0	0

bwslnt	2019-06-04 19:05:40		AITA for leaving a bad review after a refund?	"This happened a while ago but has been bugging me ever since. I bleached my hair and it was in bad condition. I booked an appointment at a hairdresser's. At the appointment I asked for my hair to be dyed my natural colour and cut short. I also asked for lowlights but didn't realise this wasn't possible and ended up not getting them (I maybe expected too much). During the appointment she complained repeatedly about my hair being in bad condition and I kept apologising. She didn't speak to me about anything else.  The hairdresser matched my hair but then when she dyed it my hair was too dark and too warm. The dye also didn't work on the ends so it looked awful, a half dye. The hairdresser said nothing so I paid and tipped her as I felt like I had been so much work from her complaining.

Over the week I used a shampoo toner to try and cool the colour but all that happened was the bleached parts turned purple. I called the salon and they told me the hairdresser was independent and it had to be her who fixed it (I later contacted the citizen's advice bureau and they confirmed that the salon should I have fixed it as I booked it through them). When I got there she roughly grabbed at my hair and then started laughing at how bad it looked.

I'm ashamed to say that I jumped up from sitting and snapped at her, asking why she was laughing. Someone else said it was because she was nervous but she had looked to be smirking to me. She offered to try to fix it but didn't seem very confident about it and said if she had dyed my hair my natural colour it would have gone green (but didn't say this when she dyed my hair or I would have done it myself). She claimed the dark colour would matched when it grew up but it was dark brown and my colour is dark blonde. I told her I had tipped her because she made me feel so bad but she just grabbed my hair and said ""but it is broken"" like it made it ok. I got a full refund (including tip) and angry glares as I left but no apology.

When I got back I was pretty upset about how she had treated me both times. I wrote a long review on their Facebook page and tried to be clear I was annoyed by the hairdresser's attitude and \*not\* the hairdye itself (I knew my hair was in bad condition). I also mentioned that I felt sorry for snapping at her. Immediately the hairdresser's friends reacted with angry faces and said I was lying and trying to ruin her business. I tried to respond to them but it just made it worse. They also left about ten separate positive reviews for the hairdresser with snide comments about ""people"" who have bleached hair. I got no reply from the hairdresser or salon. Eventually my account was locked and the review disappeared (it was a new account as I don't use facebook and with a fake name).

&#x200B;

I've wondered ever since if I was the asshole for snapping at her and then for leaving a negative review after being refunded. It seems everyone else really likes the hairdresser so I don't understand what happened with me.

bwskgn	2019-06-04 19:03:10	JessicaFL127	AITA for wanting to cut my family off for ignoring my son's disease foundation annual walk?	"My son has a progressively fatal genetic disorder (first known appearance in my family) and I am very involved in the annual walk to raise awareness and funds for research.  The walk has been going on for about 10 years and my son is a teenager, diagnosed at age 2, so we have been there every year since it started, and I also serve on the committee to plan it, gather donors and recruit teams.  

  It has been bothering me for a while that my siblings and aunts and uncles make little to no effort to be involved at all.  My parents come to the walk every year, but my siblings don't bother.  I send a facebook post about a month before and again about a week before to everyone on my fb list, and also send a group text with the link to join his team.  I don't push anyone to donate or fundraise, but I do ask if they would join his team (virtual walkers are an option).  This year I put out the same posts and texts and added that it is very important to our family and I would appreciate supporting his team.  

&#x200B;

After the second text, I did get a donation from my brother and my niece joined the team, but still no effort from anyone else.  I doubt any of them will show up since they never have before.  My sister lives within walking distance of the park where the walk is held and that one hurts the most.  She has not responded to either forum or signed up.  

&#x200B;

We don't have any issues or bad blood or anything, everyone gets along, it just seems to be more of everyone does their own thing and we get together at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I understand that we aren't a close knit group but I think that something this serious is worth their effort.  My son has already outlived his prognosis of 12 years and many other kids with the disease.  Research and a cure is incredibly important to me and I am afraid he is running out of time.  

&#x200B;

I have the urge to just cut contact completely with the whole lot of them, especially my sister.  I am very frustrated that they don't make an effort at all and just treat it like some hobby I do or something.  I am not confrontational and won't put it in their faces, but they do know how much it means to me."	No A-holes here	0	0

EDIT:  I want to say that I do want to take back my final question above.  I was angry when I wrote that and realized shortly after how awful that was.  Whats done is done and I absolutely DO NOT want to make the groom uncomfortable during his special time.  Seriously guys I get it.  

I AM upset though that my husband agreed to this without asking me, and I honestly believe this shouldn't have been asked of him us in the first place.  I also want to add some context below that will maybe help some of you stop thinking I am the devil in the flesh.

We are all in our late 40's, this grooms second marriage, grooms second destination wedding, and second time my husband has been the best man.  This is about the groom, who makes more than my husband and I combined, not wanting to pay for a hotel room that night.  That is all.  I am not keeping the two of them from hanging out and getting drunk and reminiscing, and neither of them are big drinkers.  I wasnt planning on locking my husband and myself in the room after the rehearsal dinner.  We of course would spend the rest of the evening with the groom, or they can do something without me, I am fine with either.  Contrary to what alot of you are assuming, I do like the groom and never stated otherwise.   I just feel at the end of the night that groom should be sleeping in his own room.  And this is NOT the same as having someone stay at your house, and in fact groom has stayed at our home.  This is about sharing a tiny living space with someone I am not very close with, and wanting my own space."	No A-holes here	0	0

But they do stuff behind closed doors whenever he is here. And I don't want to know anything about it. So on Sunday, when we were having breakfast, I bought this up. I told my daughter that she can't do anything sexual when they are in the house. At this point my daughter started crying and she was like- ""We are not allowed to do anything in our house and his house. Where should we do anything then? On the street?"". She left after that. 

My husband had a wtf expression on his face. And he agreed with her and told me that it would be unsafe to do anything outdoors and it is better if they did it under supervision. I just can't believe it. I thought my husband would support me. Was I the asshole here?"	No A-holes here	0	0

We talked, and both of us wants to keep it. He is really looking forward to be a dad and wants badly to be involved from the delivery room to everything else that follows. I thought it was nice if he would be there. My due date is in 5 days.

I will be honest, I have been hoping to get back together and have a complete family. We do not live together. But yesterday we had a massive fight about something I rather not discuss. Maybe it's hormones, maybe we're just not meant to be, but I am extremely hurt, I don't want to see his face and my belly has been contracting a lot. I called my midwife, she told me to come to the hospital and said I'm in the early stages of labor already. So here I am, with my mom and she asked if she should call ex. I said I dont know, I dont want to be around him right now, maybe not? I really don't know. She said I shouldn't take this away from him as this is his first child as well. What do I do?

" I work in product development and have studied the art of inventing for years and years as both a hobby and profession. I belong to a few inventors groups on LinkedIn so I get a lot of random requests from other inventors.

So this guy, probably mid-20's, adds me and I check out his profile. His page is full of posts about his product, which is essentially a large doggy cage with a bunch of tubes with holes connected to a large hair dryer to dry off your dog after a shower. He clearly has spent a lot of time and money on this. He only has renderings, no prototype of any sort. I messaged him asking him about this product to get more details, and he tells my how he's spent thousands hiring a patent attorney, free-lancers, set up an LLC, trademarks, etc. and has been working on this project for years. He thinks he's going to make millions off it.

I straight up told him how it is. I told him that this product would never sell and listed off the reasons: the shear size of it (probably 3ft x 5ft), the weight of it, the massive price-tag, the physics of it (I'm a mechanical engineer and know a thing or two about air flow and heat transfer), how the dog would act inside the machine, how much money he'd have to raise to get it off the ground, how it's not an improvement from a normal hair dryer and towel, etc. This thing would never sell in a million years.

I was nice in my message and complimented him on his creativity and perseverance, but I didn't want him to fall into the trap that so many inventors fall into and that is: any money I put into this will be multiplied back into my pocket. I straight up told him not to spend another penny on this. I felt bad but said what had to be said."	Asshole	0	0

 Here's some depth. 

Me and this girl used to be best friends eventually we grew apart and haven't seen each other for a while although do have some on and off messages to check in with each other. She has a son who's 5 and often asks to go on play dates but I always make an excuse and say no. 

Her son seems to be brought up differently to how I bring my little one up. She allows swearing and laughs when he says ""booty and bitches that's what I like"" and various things to that nature. He seems to be quite frankly a little shit, he rules the roost more or less and gets away with murder. He plays GTA and COD ect so gets alot of bad language from that. He doesn't seem to understand the word no. As far as I'm aware he doesn't hit and things but the way he speaks and acts is shocking and dont want my child learning from it. 

In all honestly I also dont like how shes changed and dont agree with alot of what she does when child free. It's been hard to watch her become the person she is now because I know in most ways this isnt her, but suppose we just have different lifestyles now. We've become more acquaintances than friends. ""A girl I used to know"" sort of thing. She has alot of people around her but none that seem good for her or that genuinely care. I'm wondering if shes reaching out as a way to move away from things (maybe I'm looking too much into it) but I have my own family and life now and I wont get tangled in anyone else's. Mine comes first no matter what. 

But I cant help but feel bad for keep putting her off and on the brink of telling her why but I dont want to upset her or comment on her parenting because that's none of my business, but shes starting to ask questions. 

It's been a while since I have spoken to my husband about it but on last check he says I was in the right and also doesn't want our little one picking up his bad habits. AITA? Why do I feel so bad?

WIBTA if I slowly cut her off? Shes just not the sort of person I want to associate myself with but feel bad for deleting her off things and not having contact because shes not done anything wrong to me shes just completely changed from the girl I once knew. I dont want to upset her either.

EDIT: my little one has never met her son and doesn't even know he exists. They haven't previously been friends. I haven't met up with her for around 7 years or so."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwsg57	2019-06-04 18:53:19	tedojaan	WIBTA if I don't call my mom on her birthday?	"I'm looking for some advice and perspective. 

My parents and I have had a rocky relationship since I was a teenager. They are controlling, emotionally and verbally abusive, and expect their children to sacrifice for them rather than the other way around. I've lived far away from them with my husband and son for about 6 years now. We would visit them about twice a year and sometimes my mom and younger brother would visit us too (my dad has never even thought of visiting me).

Getting into arguments with one or both of my parents during these trips was nothing new for us, but the last time we were there a few months ago, I got into such a huge fight with both of them a few hours before our flight, that we left their house for the airport with me in tears. The last thing my mother yelled at me before we left was ""leave my house and forget me until I'm dead!"" (If you think this is dramatic, you don't even know the half of it). I cried the entire flight home, and for the next two months after that. My husband was there for all of it, and it was only with his love and support that I made through it. 

Now here's my question. Two days after our flight back home, it was my birthday. Neither of my parents called or texted or in any way contacted me on my birthday. I kept thinking that my birthday would be a great opportunity for them to call and we would reconcile, but no such thing happened. I was (and still am) heartbroken over this. My husband keeps reassuring me that I have every right to never want to speak to them again, but it's so hard to lose your parents when they're not even dead. The sadness, the guilt, the anger, the resentment. It's very hard. I've only spoken to my mom maybe three or four times since my birthday, and she has never mentioned it and neither have I. Her birthday is coming up, and I have every desire to treat her the same way, but I'm conflicted about whether that would make me TA or not."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bwsev6	2019-06-04 18:50:11	gabdmm	AITA for calling out my coworker for being 45 seconds late to their shift	"This happened a while ago, but I feel like I may have overreacted.

I work in a small convenience store. It’s small enough that only one member of staff ever works at a time. I would always be on the weekend early shifts, opening at 7am and doing a handover at 2pm. My Sunday coworker was awesome - never any issues. Saturday was a problem. Every week without fail, my coworker would be late. Sometimes 15 minutes. Sometimes 3 minutes. Never on time. This always annoyed me to no end because I wouldn’t get paid for the time I stayed, but he did get paid from 2pm as long as he was no more than 15 minutes late... and what do you know, he was never more than 15 minutes late. 

This irked me in the beginning, but it got worse when I fell pregnant. Maybe it was my hormones, maybe I was being an asshole. I dunno. I would try to make a point of it, he would promise to be on time next time... never was. Anyway, one week he was 7 minutes late and I saw him sauntering up to the store on cctv with the slowest pace in the world. Id been feeling unwell all morning and no one could cover for me. I was already in a mood. I grabbed my coat and stormed out before he even got to the door and just glared at him when I walked past. He was apologetic next time I saw him. The following week (and my last shift before maternity leave) he was 45 seconds late. I didn’t even care, it was close enough for me. But as he came in, he grinned and exclaimed ‘See; on time’. Maybe I should have left it, but I didn’t. I said, in a light tone ‘You need to be here as the clock strikes 2pm if you want to be on time’. He got really offended and was adamant that no, as long as his phone said 2pm the second he walked in, he was on time. I asked him, by that logic should I not be allowed to leave as soon as my phone says 2pm? Potentially leaving the shop unmanned for almost a minute. It got quite tense before I just walked out shaking my head. It was his defensiveness that got to me, I hadn’t intended for it to become an argument, I was making light initially. 

My goodness, this sounds ridiculously petty typing out. But it’s irked me for the past while and I’m due to return to work soon. Was I the asshole here? I’m starting to feel like I might have been."	Asshole	0	0

bwsdit	2019-06-04 18:46:54		WIBTA for not helping my mom's restaurant?	"Lot's of backstory so here's the deal - My parents got divorced when I was 16, my dad was the breadwinner but bought my mom a restaurant bc he didn't want her to not have a source of income (she's an immigrant and doesn't have any job history in America, but cooking is her passion anyways). Fast forward, I am 21 now, living on my own, pay my own bills except for car payments my dad makes.

So, before my slight independence my dad went to go live with his new wife and her kids in a different city leaving my sister and my mom behind. My mom paid my bills, my car insurance, everything really except my food and gas (but I did have a part-time job) but because of this I would help her out at her restaurant when I could and serve and wash dishes.

I was pretty good at saving money and wanted to use my savings for college (it was established my dad would pay for my college but that changed when they got divorced) but my mom had hit a rough point with her restaurant and owed a lot of money, long story short I gave her $5,000 about a year ago (which she said she was going to pay back but never did so I told her to just chalk it down to that is the amount she paid my bills after my dad left and call it even) and then another $600 for rent she couldn't afford months later, and then we were about to be evicted but my sister helped - from this point forward I no longer wanted to boggled down by my moms financial issues and got a full-time job and moved out.

So that's not the issue, the issue is she recently broke up with her boyfriend who helped her with everything at the restaurant and now she's struggling to keep up with the work because he did a lot. My sister works there and continues to live with my mom rent free but complains about me not helping (like coming in when it's busy on weekends or helping clean after hours). I've expressed to my mom she should look into executive chef positions if she can't keep up with her restaurant but it always ends in argument and that I need to help more.

My mom and my sister think i'm being selfish and cold when I say no to coming in but I honestly just don't feel any sympathy because they both continue to get their nails, hair, and eyelashes done (yes, eyelash extensions are a thing) on a monthly basis even though I've sacrificed a lot in the past and it feels like a slap in the face. But my boyfriend also thinks if i'm not doing anything I should just go and help and i'm just being lazy bc my full-time job isn't strenuous, but I don't think he grasps the amount of help I've given her in the past.

So, am I the asshole if I choose to no longer help my mom with her restaurant? I still love her and see her but I mean just no longer financially and physically being there for her business."	No A-holes here	1	0

bwscvp	2019-06-04 18:45:28	ThinkPersimmon	WIBTA if I refused to speak at a memorial for my brother?	"My older brother and I were 13 years apart, but he died suddenly when I was 4 - he was 17. Obviously, my parents took it really hard and they were scared I would too. At the time, I don't think I knew what was happening at all, but my parents made it a priority to have me in grief counseling, which I did up until a year after he passed. To this day, I have absolutely no memory of him. I don't know his voice, face, etc. except for what I've seen in photos or videos.

I don't know if I'm going to explain this well, but I feel like my parents have always placed more emphasis on our relationship than actually existed/exists? They always talk about how as a little kid, if I was having a fit, I'd just see him and start to calm down, or how we were ""two peas in a pod"" and inseparable, how my older brother was so excited to have a little brother to teach and how they see so mcuh of him in me or whatever. But I don't remember any of that. When people ask me if I have siblings I say no, because I don't and it feels like I never did. I have no connection to him, I just don't feel anything towards him. He sounds like a great guy but I don't know that.

Anyways, my parents are hosting their annual memorial for his birthday, and they want me to speak. Before, they thought I was too young but apparently 16 is the perfect age to talk about your dead brother. I hate talking about him or the memorial with my parents because they get really sad and nostalgic and it makes me feel uncomfortable because they start up with the ""you look so much like him"" and I just feel suffocated. My friends are torn - half think it'd be rude if I didn't just make up something generic and go, the other half think I should just skip the memorial altogether if it makes me feel weird. I feel like any adult in my life will automatically tell me to speak because it's the right thing to do for my parents, but I don't want to. It would all be generic lies or parroting stories my parents have told me a million times.

bwsbu9	2019-06-04 18:43:10	seedypete	AITA for wanting to regift something to my kid?	"So my wife and I have been joking back and forth about this for a few days and I'm curious to see what the reddit consensus is. 

A bit of background, my son (well, stepson) is 6 and has a birthday coming up. Right now he is at his bio dad's house for the first half of the summer. We have gotten him a ton of presents for his birthday when he gets back.

Now I am a huge dork and love building giant LEGO sets. (The building of them is the fun part for me, afterwords I just give them to the kids to play with because as far as I'm concerned the fun part is over. This gets relevant later.) It's something that I always wanted to do as a kid but our family couldn't afford it. My wife, who is awesome, totally indulges me in my nerdery and as an early Father's Day gift she got me a gigantic Millennium Falcon set, which I have been cheerfully putting together ever since. I'll finish it long before our son gets back home.

My thinking was ""I could just take it all apart once I'm done building it, put it back in the box, and put it with my son's other gifts so he thinks we got him one more giant thing!"" Yeah the pieces will be loose in the box but he won't notice anything odd about that, he's 6 and has never gotten a LEGO set this big so he wouldn't know to expect a lot of smaller individual bags. It's **way** too complex for him at this age, but that's fine, he always wants me to build things with him so we would just end up working on it together anyway and I don't mind building it again so he can participate.

My wife laughed but said she doesn't think we should trick him into thinking that was a gift for him, and that we should just tell him she got it for me but that we'll build it together regardless. My reasoning is that it doesn't matter because I was going to give it to him to play with anyway, and he would want to build it with me anyway, so why not let him think he had an even bigger pile of presents than he actually got? I feel like seeing that giant complicated box *for him* will blow his little mind.

So, what do you think? Is that an asshole move or some harmless parental trickery? We're probably just going to err on the side of honesty, but my wife and I are curious which one of us the sub will side with here. Help us resolve our friendly debate!"	No A-holes here	0	0

My mom recently just told my family that we all have to start paying rent by September.

The price isn't a huge issue however I've been planning on moving out for a few months and haven't told anyone in my family yet. The reason I want to move out is 1) my mom has a side job where she sings online usually late at night. It gets extremely annoying. 2) one of my brothers rages all the time at video games. Shouts slurs and generally has a rage problem. I do not want to live in the room next to him.

bwsabz	2019-06-04 18:39:38		AITA for doing yard work my way and not my husband's way?	"My husband and I have been working on cleaning up our backyard this year. It's an overgrown mess of 15 trees and about 8 feet of overgrown vegetation from the back fence to towards the center of our yard. He worked hard all week to clear the vegetation and we only had a small section left. He was going to be gone for the day to be with our niece at an amusement park and my family was coming over to continue helping with yard work. Him and I walked through the yard and discussed what items I should focus on and ultimately he said it was my decision how the day went since he wouldn't be there.
Fast forward to me and my family cutting down about 5 small trees and clearing the rest of the vegetation. It was exhausting work and we filled a roll-off dumpster with all of the yard debris. 
Anyway, husband comes home and wakes me up at 11pm to tell me he was pissed I bought 6 bottles of ground clear to help kill off the vegetation. We had already talked about using ground clear but he claims the 6 bottles was way too much to need and that he didn't want to look at it so he put it in the back of my vehicle instead of leaving it in the garage. Ok. Fine. I guess....then he gets pissed that I focused on cutting down trees and that I cut down a small cedar tree that he was apparently in love with. He then proceeds to tell me that the cedar tree reminded him of his childhood home because it's location is the same as his childhood home one in proximity to the house. He has never before shared this with me. I conceded to letting him know I should have texted him I was going to cut that particular tree down, but had no idea it meant that much to him.  Plus we had to level the top of the roll-off dumpster and the easiest way to do that with branches sticking out was use the heavy logs from cutting down trees (that we were going to remove anyway). we argued over what things I prioritized, he quickly apologized for waking me up and then left to sleep in the guest room.
So am I the asshole for running the day the way I wanted to and cutting down a tree I had no idea he had such an emotional attachment too?? I feel like all that hard work was for nothing because I don't think he appreciates all that we did."	Not the A-hole	1	0

I haven't yet started on the project of my friend, who I'll call Z, but I'll do most, if not all of it. I feel horrible, though. I've hated cheaters and think it's dishonest to pay someone to do your work for you.

The thing, though, is that Z is struggling majorly. For one, English is her third language, and while she speaks it pretty well, she doesn't write well at all. (The project is for her English class.) Secondly, Z has had next to no time to do it with her other classes going on. Normally I'd say that it's not my problem and she just needs to manage her time better, but lastly...

Z has been a wreck lately. Her cousin has been missing for 10 days, and her entirely family thinks  the cousin's husband murdered her, since he left America at the time of her disappearance. It's even on the news, apparently. The police have been hounding her family for a while with questions lately, and she can't catch a break.

Still, this is college. Community college, but still. I take my academic work very seriously. I have never cheated or helped someone cheat. I think it's unfair to her teacher to receive ""her"" work when she didn't even do it.

EDIT/UPDATE: You guys are right. It isn't right for me to do this. Z only asked me for help today. She'd already gone to her teacher to get extra time, and he gave it. She's wasted her extra time and is at the end of the extended due date. She JUST told me that it's due tomorrow.

Hell no, I'm not gonna do all her dirty work. She had plenty of time. She's just been lazy and put it off till the last second. She's gone to other people to do it, but they refused.

We live in a 2 bedroom apartment. When my daughter was born my MIL said she wanted to come visit without my FIL and that she was happy to just sleep on the couch (not something we had offered). I told my husband at the time that this wasn’t ideal with a new baby to have her on the couch so we offered to get her an Airbnb in our neighborhood, put her up in a hotel, or let her stay with my parents who are 15 minutes away. She declined all of that saying she would not be comfortable in an Airbnb or hotel alone, and that staying with my parents defeated the purpose because she wanted to come to be helping with the baby. She came and stayed with us, it was fine but tight, but we got through. 

She wants to come this summer, but now that our daughter is older and moving around, our living room is even tighter. Add to that we do not have proper AC in our place, just window units in the bedrooms so it will be so sticky and uncomfortable for her to be here then. We have asked if my FIL will come with her so that the 2 of them can stay in an Airbnb close by. He is refusing because he doesn’t like the city we live in and he’s kind of a homebody. 

AITA for standing my ground this time and asking her to consider one of the other options for accommodations? My husband is quite sure she will just not come if she can’t stay with us.

We have this one intern who is super lazy and never does any work, honestly it would make me mad if he was getting paid, but its just hours so whatever.

We were having an activities time and lo and behold, the lazy intern wasnt doing anything, when we started to play basketball he became extremely interested. We have speakers in the office and he asked if he could play music. I told him it's not for him but he can play some music for the kids. I told him he can basically play anything that doesn't have swearing, I thought that was easy enough.

He told me he would play a playlist that he has that he made specifically for something like this. I left to do some paperwork and when I came back he was blasting the most profane music that was a mix of like metal and rock. On top of that I saw all the kids just sitting on the sides of the gym, wandering around in the halls, and doing things unsupervised while the lazy ass intern was playing 1 on 1 with another volunteer.

I told him to come to my office, where I had a long talk with him. He constantly rolled his eyes and looked around the room. Finally I told him that he could leave and not to come back. He then said 

""I honestly couldnt care less, you've signed my volunteer hours and thats all I need for the coming school year.""

He left, but before doing so, he turned on his bluetooth and blasted a song that had like 5 swear words for every 5 seconds the song played.

I noticed he left his volunteer hours sheet which had upwards of 30+ hours on it, I took one look at it and ripped it up and thought nothing of it.

While I was closing up I noticed he was trying to get inside the building begging for his hours back. He told me that he needed it because he was gonna be taking night classes on top of a full schedule during his final year in hs, and it will be near impossible to get them during the school year.

His parents called, and my supervisors and a lot of people who heard about what I did called me an asshole, quite frankly I feel like it was a bit harsh, but he basically did nothing for the time he's been working at our summer camp, and I don't think he deserves to have them at all, so AITA?"

bws8uv	2019-06-04 18:36:05	PeaPod117	AITA for thinking that the friendship is too far gone?	"One of my close friends recently got a gf, also one of my friends. While I’m happy for them both, I feel like my guy friend is making some questionable decisions. Our other friends noticed this too.

He started lying to us about what he was doing when in reality he was with his gf. He would tell us things like “just woke up” or “I’m too tired” when in reality we had proof and a gut feeling that he was with her at the time, and before. I confronted him about this in a way that was not at all antagonizing or disrespectful, and he retaliated in an aggressive manner. I told him that all we wanted was for him to be straight with us. And then he went on to say that he didn’t want to hurt our feelings by telling us he’d much rather be with her than “you people.” That hurt my feelings but I still remained respectful, and said that all we wanted was the truth. All he said back was “ok.” But later I went off on him because I realized I didn’t do anything to deserve that and how he had referred to us, his closest friends, as “you people.” I know that might sound petty but the way he typed it made me feel pretty bad. He said he was sorry and that he never meant for things to go this way, etc. And I said it was ok. He’s been ok with telling the truth now.  But there are times where he still gets defensive out of nowhere, at least that’s what it seems like to me. There were also times where his gf would be actively trying to talk with the others and get to know them, but it seemed like he would pull her away or something. I’ll also try to text him just like old times and while I understand that his main priority is his gf, surely he has time to at least text back or when he does, at least act interested. Eventually I stopped texting to see if he’d ever text me, and so far he hasn’t. 

I get that being a good friend would mean being flexible and patient, but I’ve been doing that ever since they started going out (about a month now). And right now, as painful as it might be, I feel like I could live without his friendship, just because it feels like we’ve drifted so far apart and that I feel like I can’t trust him as much as I used to. 

TDLR; Friend lied to us on several occasions, although his intentions were well- meaning. Also being a bit possessive (if that’s the right word) over his gf around us. Also the fact that it seems like he isn’t putting that much effort into maintaining our friendship has me (again, I’ve been understanding of how his girl is his priority, but not even a text/ reply back from him EVER is a bit hard) thinking that our friendship is too far gone and maybe not even worth it anymore.

bws8t8	2019-06-04 18:35:58	MPoTAmoROClIF	AITA for expecting my housemates to help clean up after my party?	"There are four of us living in the house and three of us participate in a club sport. I happen to be the social officer for the club and therefore have been hosting parties at our house with the consent of my housemates. Now lately my two housemates that are part of the club refuse to help me cleanup after the party. This consists of throwing away or recycling trash/bottles, wiping tables down and sweeping the floor. They argue that only the host should clean up and that they are ""guests"" at the party. I however feel that if they are participating in the party then they should also help clean up. My logic is that it is also their house and their friend group who is coming over to have fun.  This would also include our fourth housemate who isn't part of the club but likes to join in. This has lead to some tension in the house and with some contradicting views among my friends I was wondering if I am being unreasonable.

Edit: Since a lot of people asking, there isn't much planning to the parties. It is just drinking with some games but I do ask my roommates for dates and we do buy our own drinks for the party in preparation. It is also their friend group as well as we are only inviting the club to come. Some other club members help clean up but most just leave either early in the morning or during the party."	Asshole	0	0

UPDATE: I have requested they install a covered trash can and include the rule in their listing. The response was a canned ""thank you for your feedback; we will consider your request""

I'm more inclined toward a negative review and calling support if they do not install the covered trashcan and take the matter seriously. We shall see. 

---------------------------------------

EDIT: This is in the US. 

To preface, there is no way for me to simply change reservations, so please do not advise or suggest that as an alternative. It cannot be done. 

I have a place booked for two weeks, from the 31st to the 14th. The place is immaculately clean, the hosts are respectful of privacy, provide extra amenities, and the space is quiet. It even has a/c. 

This is a five star experience...or would be if it weren't for this one thing. 

On the wall in the bathroom, it says ""please no paper in the toilet!""

I assumed this meant paper towels, perhaps feminine products, as English is not the hosts' first language. But no. They mean toilet paper. 

So every day, in a tiny trash can in the bathroom that doesn't even have a lid, there is shitty toilet paper. They dont even have the decency or forethought to fold the paper so there aren't skid marks screaming from the ivory mound of paper. 

And I just find this so utterly unsanitary and disgusting that my prissy, gut reaction is to leave a one star review. But I'm conflicted as everything else is perfect. 

Since we cannot leave and find other accommodations, I don't want to bring the problem to the hosts. Ideally, that's what I would do, leave, and give a four star review. I realize it's not their fault  we have to stay, but it is objectively unsanitary and just...to me, insane. 

I want to be fair and don't know how to be, so please, 
if you think I WBTA, please also state what review you would leave instead.

Edit2: I also have no reason to believe the septic system can't handle it. There are eight guests and NO ONE but the hosts are not flushing their toilet paper. Which might make us assholes if there really is a problem that arises later, but I'm not alone in the household refusing to let my skiddies shine."	Not enough info	0	0

I don’t get much ($6/hour + tips/2 hours), but I was able to garner almost $400 saved up. However, I have been lending money to my mom for rent, bills, and other things and it has totaled to almost $300. To be honest with you, I was just wondering if it would be bitchy for me to ask for the physical cash back when she gets a big paycheck this week, especially since she’s my mom and she does a lot for me already like clothe, feed, and give me a place to live.

I have no protests about giving her money again for the odd bill/grocery, but I truly just want the cash in physical form and not just as a “Oh, I’ll pay you back later” imaginary money.

She says she won’t answer him back. I stop seeing the guy (nothing bad, just didn’t work out) and a couple days later as I’m FaceTiming J she says “I have to tell you something but you can’t hang up or get mad” i say okay and she tells me she has slept with the guy. I was heartbroken. Not only did she break the girl code but LIED about it before. Because i didn’t want to disrupt the friendship group i really tried to make things work. I even invited J to my birthday party. After a week or two i realized i was too hurt and tired of J treating me like the butt of a joke (all of my friends do this and i hate it) so i cut her off.

We see her a few times a year and I talk to her once a week and she stays out of it. I believe my partner would be okay with this.

I want to float this idea to my partner but my friend has warned me against it and said it would make it unfair to involve my mom. I’m not looking for advice, just judgement: would I be an asshole for proposing this and wanting my mom there?

bws663	2019-06-04 18:30:13		AITA for taking my GF's shit?	"abbreviated due to 3000 character limit (if you need more info please say so in comments)

I am 25 and my now ex GF is 27. We have been dating for 6 months. When we began dating I lived in an apartment across town from her (she lived with her parents) and she would visit me or stay with me regularly. 6 weeks ago I moved into a new place, only about 5-10 minutes walk from her parents house. We decided that we wouldn't move in together at that point because it was a little soon.

Fast forward to last week and we finally decided to move in together. it is important to note that this is not an official agreement, she has only been living with me for 7 days and a lot of her possessions are still at her parents house as they have no intention of making her move out.

2 days ago I come home from work a little early to surprise her since she was a little ill that morning and you guessed it, I caught her with another man in my fucking bed.

I was fuming. I told him to get his pants on and leave. I left the room to let him compose himself and then showed him the door.

My now ex remained in the bed and tried to coerce me into getting in with her so she could show me how sorry she was. Fuck that, I told her to get dressed and go home, she didn't live here anymore. I didn't make her walk home I gave her a lift in my car but it was very awkward and she said nothing (not even an apology). Before she left I got her to give me her key to my house as I wasn't comfortable having her have a doorkey at this time.

later she texted me (still no sorry) asking when she could come by and grab her stuff, but I told her that she wasn't coming in my house again and that she could have her stuff back but her dad would have to come pick it up. Its not like there was much anyway just a bunch of clothes.

The 4 things I said I would not be giving back were her car, phone, mac and ipad. Because these things aren't hers.

I bought her an iPhone XS a few months ago after she told me about how her parents were awful for not getting her the new iPhone even though her iphoneX worked fine. The phone is under my name, I pay the bill for it. She still has her ""old"" iPhone X and I was happy to give her the sim card so she could transfer her stuff then I was stopping paying the bill.

Same thing with the mac and iPad, it was her birthday 2 weeks ago and I bought them for her. I still have a bunch of money to pay off on them so they are going back.

The car. She wrote her car off just before we met by driving drunk, a few months into our relationship I bought her a car because the one her parents had bought her to replace the one she destroyed was ""not a nice color"" or some shit. Again, my name is on the documentation for the car, I pay the bill and she is not even properly insured on it yet.

Tl;Dr - caught GF cheating on me and took back things I had given to her but were legally mine and that I was paying for."		1	0

bws4so	2019-06-04 18:27:03	gintegg	AITA for cutting ties with a friend over a project gone wrong?	"In 2015, I began working with a friend, B, on a game project, with the eventual goal of releasing it on Steam. We were both pretty naive, so we weren't taking it all that seriously, but by 2017, we had formed an impromptu development team comprised of ourselves and some of our friends.

That Summer, I brought a friend of mine, C, onto the team as a composer and budget manager. Both B and C were trusted friends I had known for years, but B and C didn't get along very well due to some prior beef.

A few months later, C and I began work on budgeting for the project. B had appointed theirself in charge of the game's funding, and C and I were getting anxious over their lack of transparency in telling us what their plan was. They finally tell us that they have no concrete budget and that they want to wait to launch a Kickstarter campaign; after the campaign, they'll make a budget based off whatever funds we receive.

C and the rest of the team hard disagree with this proposal and suggest that we form a budget now based off the funds we have immediately available. This escalates into a heated argument between B and the rest of the team; B accuses me of holding C's advice in higher regard than theirs, and promptly leaves the team because they think the rest of the team is ganging up on them.

Afterward, we take the discussion to DMs. We both said some pretty heinous things to each other, and I ended up blocking them on Discord. We had stored development-related files on a Google Drive folder, and I didn't want anything to do with it anymore, so I transferred ownership of it to B and removed it from my Google Drive. I screwed up somewhere along the way, because B was no longer able to access the folder either. I didn't intend to do this, and I apologized profusely, but B was nonetheless irate. Over the next few days they bombarded my email, Youtube, and Steam with posts about how I'm a terrible person, I'm a thieving piece of shit, etc. I was able to contact Google Support and restore the files, at which point I made sure to verify with B that they had access to the files again, before I removed them from my local drive. 

A few days later, B contacted me again, and asked me to sign a legal contract. They wanted to have both of us create our own development teams, and use the same development drafts to create two versions of the game. Whichever development team got the higher Metacritic score would assume all ownership of both projects. They also added the caveat that I would have 5 years to produce the game while they would have 10, because I ""stole their team and documents"". I thought this was ridiculous, so I declined and blocked them from all my methods of contact. They tried stalking my friends to get back in contact with me, but they dropped this after a couple days. I haven't heard from them since last year.

As far as I'm aware, B hasn't tried to get into contact with me for a year and a half now, but this whole thing is still stewing in my mind. Was I the asshole on this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bws4gu	2019-06-04 18:26:16	throw_raps_omg_1384	WIBTA if i let my ex live with me after breakup	"I have a feeling that I may be TA here, but just wanted to confirm. 

So my partner of 5 years cheated on me on multiple occasions with multiple men, and we broke up after I found out and confronted her. We live together, so simple solution here is her moving out and us going separate ways.

Complication comes in because she is currently not in a good place financially (lost her job a few months back and hasn't found new one yet), so I can't force her to move out as she'd probably go out on the streets. And she's offering a compromise where she will do ""some stuff"" in lieu of paying me rent to stay. Kind of like FWB with quid pro quo.

My moral codes tell me what she's offering, she's doing it from a place where she doesn't have power, so it's wrong to consider it equitable, or view it as being completely voluntary. On the other hand, she was unfaithful to me, so I also feel like being an ass to her is fair - yes, two wrongs don't make a right but I feel like at best it would just make both of us assholes. 

So accepting this, I have two choices; either just let her live for free, or kick her out. Considering what she did to me, the former doesn't sit well with me - although that was the arrangement we had for past few months... and kicking her out to streets also doesn't sit well either, because even though she's betrayed me she's been a good partner otherwise as far as I can recollect.

So I'm considering accepting her proposal. WIBTA if I did?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I have an exam at the exact time as the funeral, and due to the accelerated pace of summer classes, the professor will not offer any exceptions to the no makeup policy. 

My parents are fully expecting me to skip the exam (despite me telling them I’d get a 0 on it) and attend the funeral, but I have a 96% going in the class and refuse to put that in jeopardy for a funeral for someone I wasn’t even close to. They are not currently speaking to me because of this, which has never happened before as I have an extremely close relationship with my parents.

I don’t think I’m in the wrong at all, but I’d love some additional perspectives.

Edit: thanks for all the valuable input. I should add that I have spoken to the professor and she explained the policy for accelerated classes is much less lenient than normal circumstances.

Ok, so my moms fiancé, he is quite arrogant, loud, expressive, not a likeable person to anyone other than my mother and his mother it seems...and he complains a lot. Usually an hour+ long argument (tantrum) in the morning about something with my mother, at least once a week (on the weeks I’m at my moms) anyways.  Today’s  complaint was that we never say hello to him when he walks through the door or we walk through the door. First of all, I am homeschooled (online) so I am always here, so is he because he is currently unemployed and usually plays video games all day on days he is here, but my mom gets him to help out at her work. So it’s no secret that me and my sisters don’t like the guy, we never speak any rude words to his face. We complain about him behind his back though. Although he does the same to us, except not quietly and sometimes does that on purpose so “the other people in this house hear me, because they fucking don’t listen” or whatever he says. But his complaint today made me question if I was the asshole, for never saying hello to him when he comes home or goodbye when he leaves, I wasn’t doing this to piss him of honestly I didn’t even think about it, but he lives here and I just mind my own business. Cause generally when I here him pull in the driveway (if he was gone) I will go hide in my room cause I am shy and I really don’t feel like listening to him complain about how many flowers he planted at my moms work, or talk about his kids sports things, which I’ve realized is probably rude. Another thing is I always tense up when he walks into the room or awkwardly lean against the wall and look at my phone, that’s just my personality though. Anyone I am not super comfortable around I will be awkward. Am I really being that rude? I don’t mean to piss him of or anything I just give people space cause that’s what I want in return.

bwrzcg	2019-06-04 18:14:14	perpetuallypolite	AITA for not choosing SIL as a godparent	"LTL FTP, also on mobile so sorry for any grammar/ spelling mistakes. 

My wife and I are in our mid 30s and recently had our first child. We’re both Christian and want to have our son baptized in our faith (no comments on religion please). The issue is that since we got married, my in-laws, specifically my SIL, have intruded on our marriage and have begun overstepping boundaries that my wife established now that we have a baby. It got to the point where we went very low contact with them for awhile just to adjust to being new parents and having time to ourselves as a nuclear family. 

Call it pride, stubbornness, or what have you, there were mistakes made by all parties involved and it was only recently that we’ve reconciled enough to meet at family functions and be civil to each other. 

Last weekend during a cousin’s birthday party, our baby’s baptism came up and we mentioned that we had already asked the prospective godparents and that everything was already planned. My SIL immediately got upset that she wasn’t chosen and left for the restroom teary eyed. My MIL asked us if there was any way to make her one. My wife told her mom that it was too late and we had taken a lot of time to think about who we wanted as god parents and were happy with our choices. When my MIL asked me if I agreed, I told her the same thing and that my own brother wasn’t chosen but he wasn’t offended. 

My SIL came back to the conversation at this point and accused me directly of not wanting her as a godparent because of the recent tension. I was honest and told her that despite our problems, her sister and I had both decided we wanted a married couple (she’s single and hates the idea of marriage) as god parents who might one day provide additional marital and parental guidance to our child. Please note that we support any lifestyle choice but wanted our child to have the option of going to another, familiar married couple for advice in the future.  

She shouted that this was to get back at her for all the drama in the family. I had reached the limit of my patience at this point and told her that it wasn’t about her but our child. If she couldn’t understand that, then she really wasn’t ready to be a godparent to anyone. 

I knew it was wrong of me to say but before I could apologize, she started crying again and left the party. I apologized to my in-laws and wife for what I said but they just told me to give her time to get over it. My wife told me it’s not their choice, it’s ours. 

The sad thing is that I don’t know if my SIL will get over this and I feel really bad about hurting her feelings. AITA for not considering her as a potential godparent?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwrymh	2019-06-04 18:12:27	VegetableCurrent1	AITA for declining a job offer from my friend's mom last minute?	"About a month ago, I asked one of my best friends if his mom had any jobs available at her tutoring centre. For some context, I am a university graduate attending grad school next year. She was happily willing to take me on as an assistant at the centre (mostly marking assignments/papers and helping out students). We discussed mid-May of what my responsibilities were and I came in for a training session, but she had no time slots for me in May so I needed to wait until June to start (when the new schedule was released). For some additional context, job training legally must be paid at least minimum wage in my province and the session was unpaid. 

Friday, May 31st I get an email at 5pm with the June schedule (I was supposed to start today, Tuesday June 4). The email also indicated me of the hourly pay which was less than minimum wage (for the first 2 months of work, which then became minimum for the last month) in my province. I took the weekend to think about whether or not I wanted to still take this job. Ideally I would have demanded fair pay (I expected at least minimum wage), but felt uncomfortable asking because it was my friend's mom. 

On Monday morning (yesterday), I emailed my friend's mom that I was thankful for the opportunity, but I was no longer going to accept the job offer, and apologized for the inconvenience that it may bring. A few hours later, my friend texted me that I screwed over his mom, acted completely unprofessionally, and told me to get off my high horse and that I'm not too good for any job. I thanked him for trying to help me out but explained that I deserve fair pay and I'm willing to let someone else take the job if they want it. He said I disrespected him and his mom by letting her know only the day before.

My now ex-boyfriend and I broke up a little over a month ago. He adopted a dog about three years ago that has been living with him since. We moved in together about a year and a half ago, so while the dog lives with us, he is still technically my ex-boyfriend's dog. 

Fast forward to now, we found someone to take over our lease and we have to move out by the 15th of June. We are still liable to pay for the full month's rent, and he hasn't paid his half. He is eating my food and is barely coming home. The apartment is a mess from his stuff being strewn about, and he is no longer taking care of the dog. My ex has always been the one to take the dog outside, feed him, provide him with water, etc. I have taken care of the dog on a few occasions where he would come home late from work, but other than that, he was never considered my responsibility. The dog is sometimes going 12+ hours without being taken outside to go to the bathroom. I work a very unpredictable schedule and cannot let the dog out as often as I should. I told my ex he needs to take care of his dog, but he did not seem to care and shrugged it off. He's trying to say that he is now working two jobs and doesn't have time for the dog anymore, but isn't offering to give him away or find a way to leave work for a few to let him out. The dog has been ill due to holding it in for so long and has been throwing up and defecating around the apartment and when I point it out to my ex, he thinks it's normal. 

Would I be the asshole if I took the dog to the pound? I don't want the dog living a life like this where I can't leave work to let him out and his actual owner doesn't care about him anymore. Are there any legalities behind this? What else can I do? I love this dog so much but I cannot take him with me when I leave. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: for those who are rightfully concerned, when I say ""the pound"", I'm referring to a no-kill shelter. It's the best shelter in the area and they take care of all the animals. None of them have ever been euthanized. Thank you all for your concern."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwrwv0	2019-06-04 18:08:24	Happy-Eye-Ryan	AITA for canceling my nephew's pool party?	"So my nephew is graduating Kindergarten this year, and they decided to have a pool party at my place to celebrate the end of the year.  Today, I find out that my nephew was at the doctor and that he had contracted a staph infection.  I was immediately concerned, because staph is so easily spread.  So I decided that we were just going to postpone the pool party for a few months and make it a back-to-school party instead.  

My brother is livid with me.  He argues that staph can't spread in a properly treated pool.  However, I also have eczema, so getting anywhere near staph is an absolute risk for me, even though I wasn't going to swim.  My son was expected to swim with the younger kids and help out, though.  They're telling me that the doctor says it's no longer contagious.  I don't trust the doctor, to be honest, I just think it's a risk that shouldn't be taken.

Let's set aside the fact that it's my pool - the reality is that I committed to this, so I was on the hook for the use of my pool, and gladly so.  But I think it's wrong to let his entire class come over to swim and not tell people about the risk.  I think it would be a far better idea to have a back-to-school party in a few months after the staph has cleared.  I'm now being told that I need to stop treating them like kids, that they were older than I was when they had their child and that they know what they're doing - but to me, putting 15-20 kids at risk of getting an infection so that you don't have to postpone a party is a childish thing to do.  I'm extremely confident that other parents will understand, and that they would actually appreciate us postponing.  I've also considered letting the party go on, but not allowing my nephew to swim - but that would suck big time, as it's his party.

Yeah, my brother is being petty with the 'I was older than you when I had my child.'  I have a 17 year old and a 10 year old, so I've been there with the having to miss parties because of sickness.  They think this should be their decision, and I've considered just letting them have the party and saying 'I told you so' afterward if anyone gets it - but of course, that comes at the expense of spreading a bad bacterial infection to other kids, so it's not really much of an option and not something I would do.  I would far rather my nephew be the kid who had to postpone a party than the kid who gave half the 5 year olds in our town Staph."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwrw0k	2019-06-04 18:06:31	dhhwhaufbejbdh	WIBTA for dumping a guy for his comments on my financial situation?	"I recently got in a relationship with this guy, John. We’re both in college and it’s a new thing between us. He’s been fun and kind for the most part. For context, he’s from a middle/upper-middle class family. But recently, my parents came to town and had dinner with us. That’s when John showed some new colors.

For some background, I’m very fortunate to live in the family I do. I don’t have any student loans and I know I won’t have to worry about being homeless or paying medical bills. I get a decent allowance each month to cover food and rent so I can focus on my education. I understand I am incredibly lucky to have this and I work hard so I don’t squander the opportunity my parents gave me. However, in my family, you don’t flaunt wealth or be some trust fund kid without a job. You save and you innovate and you be responsible.

Because my dad travels so much for his company, he gets a ton of miles and first class upgrades. At dinner, my parents told a funny story about their flight where they sat in first class. John said, “Oh wow first class - I didn’t know you guys were rich.” This made my parents super uncomfortable and we changed the subject.

Since that dinner, John has been mentioning my family’s wealth constantly. He tells me I should buy dinner when we usually split because I can afford it. When I was talking about grad school, he asked if i felt lucky because “Mommy and Daddy will pay for it.” If I wear a nice dress or carry a designer purse that either I saved for or was given as a gift, he’ll say something like, “Look at the rich girl!”

These comments aren’t constant and he says he’s joking but I feel like he’s not. I can’t help the family I’m born into and I feel like I’m well adjusted and a hard worker. I don’t like feeling guilty because of something I can’t help. I also kind of feel like if I dumped him for this, it’d come off as me dumping him because I’m ~so much better than him~ and he’d tell people we broke up because of that.

WIBTA if I broke up with John because he keeps making “jokes” about this?

Edit: I did talk to him about it and said that the comments made me uncomfortable. That’s when he said they were jokes. Every time I remind him I don’t like those “jokes”, he’ll lay off for a bit and then brings them up again."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I then come to find out  later they were talking smack about my wife and i being all ""Oh of course the weird creepy anon is a great guy NOW for her.

"My wife loves flowers, especially peonies, she will see flowers around town or while walking and pick them and bring them home. She usually shies away from private property, but I'm not entirely convinced of that. Everytime she does it I express my disapproval. My main argument is that she is removing beauty from the public space.

Yesterday we were on a walk on vacation and she points out some pretty flowers and walked over to pick one. I immediately told her to stop and continued to get agitated and was close to yelling. She picked it anyway, she did it wrong and it started falling apart. She went straight over to the trash and threw it away.

After the incident I told her something like, if she ever picked a public flower in my presence again there would be issues. I think she took it as a hollow threat.

"I’m a first time mom and my baby is just a little over three months old, ie. the super wiggly/poor head control stage.  His aunt has a baby that is a few months older but was a preemie and is developmentally almost identical.  

I saw a picture posted this morning of her standing on a concrete patio posing for a picture with both babies and I just about lost it.  Both of these kids try to throw themselves out of your arms when you’re just holding one of them and holding two is just asking for trouble.  They’re both pushing 14lbs and if one were to flop their head forward or throw themselves sideways, it would be insanely easy to drop one.

I didn’t want to put my boyfriend in the middle so I texted her myself and I asked that she not hold them both together again and explained the reasoning I listed above.  She apologized and seemed remorseful and said she wouldn’t do it again. 

So, AITA?  Am I overprotective and overreacting?  I am already sensitive to her interactions with him bc she tends to lack social boundaries.  She invited herself over more than once when he was tiny and I was exhausted and would stay for hours when I had clearly told her we were limiting all visits to 1 hour and gave her a specific time to leave by (we had to start doing this bc we had a ton of visitors in the beginning).  Perhaps my view of this situation is clouded by previous interactions where I felt she lacked good judgement and respect for boundaries."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bwrrfh	2019-06-04 17:56:18	Th3-Arch1t3ct	AITA For Not Wanting To Interact With My Landlord In Person?	"So, I am currently having some serious boundary issues with my landlord(s)/property managers.  They live on the property and make themselves very accessible (maybe too much so).  I am used to major metropolitan cities and I have a hands-off approach when it comes to people who offer professional services (e.g. cleaning service, financial advisor, landlords, etc.). 

There were always boundary issues but as of recently, it has excessively gotten out of hand.  They knocked on my door after 9 pm (rang the doorbell and knocked multiple times like it was an emergency) to discuss a matter.  Stated that our schedules didn’t line up and that they kept missing me.  I was perplexed as neither party asked for an in-person meeting and looking to see if my car is parked in my space is not an open invitation.

They have approached my guests and “interrogated” them and afterward rang my doorbell (the only infraction had in years, had to run to the restroom and didn’t feel like dragging an entourage with me).  They have approached me on the property and asked if I was smoking (it’s not allowed and I have never smoked a day in my life).  They have approached me on several occasions accusing me of giving out the security code (which I have never done -.-).  

I have NEVER gone to their residence and rang the bell/knocked on their door under any circumstance, so I am confused about the double standard.  I am confused as to why they cannot communicate via e-mail and leave it at that (especially since there is a legitimate record versus word-of-mouth).  I am also now part of a group text message (including individual message) that I never gave permission to be a part of.  

Although it may sound insignificant, these interactions have become anxiety provoking and a pain in the you know what.  I dread parking because I’m wondering if they’ll pop out of a corner to complain or accuse me of something.  Or in general, if I am in a rush to get somewhere or get to my place I don;t want to make small-talk for 10 minutes.

At this point, I have no idea what to do.  I really just want to write a blunt, direct, respectful e-mail to not come to my residence unless it is an absolute emergency but am afraid of damaging our non-existent rapport (only surface rapport remains lol).

bwrrep	2019-06-04 17:56:14		AITA for not allowing my in-laws to meet my newborn?	"I had a baby a few months ago and my in-laws were supposed to come meet him about a week after he was born.  On the day they're supposed to arrive, they call and say that they were babysitting my nephew the night before and he had woken up that morning with the flu.  We called our pediatrician and asked if it'd still be okay if they came and our doctor advised against it, since my baby was literally only 5 days old.  We arranged for my in-laws to come the next week after we were sure that they weren't going to bring the flu to our house.

Fast forward to Sunday night (they are supposed to come Monday).  The flu has run it's way through my nephew's entire family, including his older brother, but my in-law's did not get it.  My husband and I start receiving texts on the family thread of older nephew's familiy birthday dinner, which my in-laws are attending.  I flipped out and told my husband that since older nephew was sick, my in-laws had re-exposed themselves to the flu and they could no longer come the next day.  This is especially frustrating because I also have a 2 year old and ended up with a c-section so we were counting on their help for a few days after my husband went back to work.  When my husband called my MIL to tell her, she got very upset and defensive, saying that they thought it was fine to go to the birthday party because older nephew's pediatrician said he could go back to school 24 hours after having a fever (in my opinion, exposing 3rd graders to the flu vs. a newborn is very different) and that we were overreacting and keeping her from her grandson.  We stood our ground and allowed them to come the next week, but recently she and my BIL made a comment about how we were dramatic about it and should have let them come.  

tl;dr My in-laws knowingly exposed themselves to the flu and got upset when I didn't let them come visit my newborn."		1	0

During this time I thought i'd ask one of the members of staff I had a crush on out, she says yes and we go out. Afterwards we said we had fun and should do it again sometime. Sometime passes and she changes her mind and thats that. I was pretty gutted because i've been into her for years and continue to be. 
Some things came up and I ended up having to stay at this job but now everyone I work with knows we went out, knows how I feel about her and how she pretty much rejected me.

For as long as I’ve had him, I’ve been doing all the duties that come along with being a dog owner. I feed him, take him to the vet, pay for his vet bills and food, take him on walks, you get the gist. I don’t mind doing it at all because it’s what I accepted when I decided I wanted to be a dog owner. I have grown to absolutely love him.

My girlfriend (we do not live together, we are currently about 2 hours of driving apart) says that it is her dog as well. I tell her that when she pays for part of his expenses and starts to take care of him on a regular basis, then he will be hers as well. She does not take it well when I say it. She says that it’s still her dog. When she comes to visit, she critiques me saying that I’m training him wrong, that I’m not teaching him correct hand signals. For example, I snap my fingers and he will sit. She got mad because he doesn’t respond to him pointing to sit, and I tell him that I trained him, by myself I might add, to sit on a snap. She got mad at me for “training our dog wrong” when she hasn’t been here to take care of him at all. She doesn’t contribute to his expenses either. 

Because he is still a puppy, I have to let him out early. So every morning, I let him out at 6AM so he doesn’t whimper in his coop all morning. It’s starting to become a routine that I don’t mind. When my girlfriend does come to visit, if I ever ask her to take him out in the morning for me so I can maybe sleep a little longer, she says “why, it’s not my responsibility”, and is super cranky that I get out of bed to take him on a walk.

bwrn9l	2019-06-04 17:46:33	Wynteral	AITA for not accepting my boss’s request to follow me on social media?	"It’s been a couple months since I’ve started working at a small pet clinic and I’d like to think I have a good relationship with my coworkers. They’re all fairly older than me and we have decades of years between us, so while I think of them as friends, I don’t really speak with them as I would with people my age. My boss recently created a new Instagram and has found my Facebook account. Both of which she has sent a request to follow / be my friend. There are things on my social media that I didn’t feel comfortable letting her see, especially because it was a professional work environment, so I ignored both requests and kept to myself.

She approached me about a week later asking if I had seen her requests. It was a bit awkward to say yes and that I deleted them, and I gave the lousy excuse that I didn’t use them often to see. She pulls out her phone in the break room, shows me the screen, and requests to follow me again. She advised me to take out my phone and to accept it. Finally, I told her that I wanted to keep my private life separate from work, and that I would accept it another time. 

Unfortunately she didn’t take that too lightly, and was upset and obviously offended that I said no. She said that social media was outside of work and it was okay for us to be friends. When I told her there were just some things I’d rather keep private, she accused me of having some dangerous, illegal things on my profile and took it to the head hospital manager to reopen my application interview in case I was suspicious of something unprofessional?  She stated something like they needed to rescreen me to make sure my public profile on the internet wouldn’t tarnish the clinic’s reputation. 

Should I have just accepted?

INFO: No, I don’t have anything explicit or illegal on any of my social media, I didn’t want to accept because there are a few things I didn’t want her to see. I’m in a lesbian relationship and I have many photos of my girlfriend and I, and I knew she was somewhat religious and I didn’t want her to judge me. I also have photos of my tattoo that they are not aware about because they do not allow tattoos at the clinic. I wear long sleeve scrubs so they’ve never seen it.

EDIT: Thank you all for putting in your input. They had pulled me aside yesterday for my 3 month review and HR and my boss were there. They brought up the topic of my social media and thankfully HR sided with me. We never signed a disclosure when I got hired regarding my social media so by law, it was out of their jurisdiction and practically none of their business. They saw that all my accounts were marked private and there was nothing that they can find against me anyway. It’s awkward to work with my boss but I’m glad it’s done and over with. Thanks y’all!"

"Nephew came over to our house yesterday and as we are chatting he’s tells me how his dad (husbands brother) took their dog to the vet and decided to put him down that morning (he didn’t the dog is still alive). The dog is a black lab so he has many health problems and giant coconut sized tumors all over his body so it’s been an open discussion for a long time in the family how to make this dog comfortable given his state. The conversation always goes like “Otto’s not doing great today he’ll probably die tomorrow haha.” -BIL. He always laughs it off but we know it hurts him to think about his dog dying because he loves his dogs. He’s a mans man though and would never ever admit to that. So BIL deciding on a whim put his family’s dog down is very out of character since the track record of his animals has always been he keeps them alive until they die from their ailments or injuries even though he should put them down for the dogs own comfort. 
Anyway, I told my husband about him putting Otto down and he’s upset too. The family (us, MIL, nephew) all watch Otto when BIL is out of town for work and my husband has known him since a puppy. They’ve hiked thousands and thousands of miles together and they have so many stories about the dogs getting into crazy shit out in the woods. Otto belongs to BIL but he’s our family’s dog too. Or at least that’s how we feel. We love and care about him like he’s ours. All we want is to say a proper goodbye maybe cook that good boy a steak or at the very least tell him we love him. 
So tell me are we the assholes for wanting to know before BIL puts his dog down so we can say goodbye even though he isn’t our dog?

Edit: we live on the same street as BIL and would never ask him to wait for us. If it’s time it’s time and if we can’t make it that’s on us."	Asshole	0	0
bwrldi	2019-06-04 17:42:10	Flaky_Pie	WIBTA if I announce we are expecting a week before my cousins wedding?	"My wife and I are expecting our first child this winter.  We would like to make the announcement at the 12 week point, which is considered the ""safe"" time because miscarriages are a lot less likely to happen.   The problem is, my cousins wedding is a week or so after our 12 week mark, which is right around the corner.  The other issue is, my cousin and I are not on good terms.  I was not invited to her wedding because I didn't invite her to mine.  My wedding was only immediate family at the court house. No friends, no extended family.  She was upset by this and decided not to invite my wife and I to her wedding as a result.  I did apologize that her feelings were hurt and she told me that she didn't invite us because we aren't ""close"".  Which, yes that is true, but she is also not close with the many other cousins she did invite.  I thought we were on good terms up until then.  We are the only family not invited, and it is going to be a big celebration for them.

 I do not want our expecting announcement to come off as trying to steal her thunder.  If it was a close friends wedding I would wait but since it is my estranged cousin, I don't know if I care as much or if the same rules apply since we aren't on speaking terms.  She straight up told me she was ok with hurting peoples feelings about not being invited to her wedding,  but I still not want to over step.
I'm unsure what to do.  We have been waiting patiently to tell people about our exciting news.   I just would really hate to faux pas, even though we aren't on good terms.  Would this be an asshole move?    FWITW, she lives far away and I won't likely ever have to see her again except maybe at funerals and other cousins weddings.

bwrl3u	2019-06-04 17:41:31		AITA for forcing the hostess to sit my family in the bar section?	"My mom, sister, and I went to Red Robin for lunch this past weekend. My sister wanted to sit in the bar area (not the bar itself, but the high tables in the bar area). There was no one sitting at the bar and only one other group at a different high table (the bar can be seen from the entrance of the restaurant).

I asked the hostess to be seated in the bar area and they told me that they would ask the bartender if they are up for the ""extra work"". I was a little confused but I said okay and then went back to my family and told them what the hostess had said to me. My mom and sister both thought it was a little weird.

When the hostess finally came back (it literally took them about 5 minutes to go ask a question) and told me that the bartender had said no. I asked why. The hostess said that the bartender would be forced to wait tables on top of having to make drinks. I then pointed out the already occupied table in the bar section. The hostess said that it would be too much for one person to handle.

I asked if they were understaffed or something at the moment (which would have been a perfectly valid excuse for me), but the hostess said no. So I asked why again. She said that the bartender just wasn't up for it. So I said, ""Well, that really isn't for the bartender to decide, is it?"" The hostess was taken aback but obliged and took us to the bar section.

The bartender was visibly upset and we got the worst service I've ever had in my entire life. Usually, I am forgiving when it comes to poor service because I've been in the same position when I was younger. However, the restaurant was not busy and the bar section was practically empty. The whole time we were there only my family and the other group occupied the bar section. We saw the bartender make a total of 3 drinks. I tipped $1 - the lowest I've ever tipped someone.

Well today she called me dumb after last night telling me she’s been worried about me. i know it’s stupid to get mad over that but it just pushed me over the edge with everything going on in my mind right now. i ended up posting something about her being a self centered person and calling her a bitch. i just needed somewhere to express how i felt but i forgot that she can see it too. she saw it and i know she’s upset. i’ve already apologized many times and explained things to her and i’m now just gonna give her space. then i remember she’s at practice. i feel like an asshole for letting her feel like this at practice. i probably am and just ruined everything for her at practice.

bwrhv2	2019-06-04 17:33:57	Calypso3110	AITA for refusing to help my friend do her homework?	"So, for some info first, I live in a non-english speaking country that is visited by many foreigners.Tourism has basically inclined all locals to start learning english by the age of 6 by taking classes in language learning centres. As we get older, we have to take some certain exams to prove our knowledge of english, first the exam for the certificate of competency in English and then the exam for the certificate of proficiency in English (I have both, by the way).Those certificates are really important, almost every person under the age of 35 has them and they are essential when it comes to searching for a job.
My friends consider me to be the best in our friend group when it comes to my knowledge of english, and I have helped them many times with their homework. Sometimes I even do all the work for them and they don't even try. I never had a problem with this, except for now.
One of my friends has to take the exam for the certificate of competency in English this Saturday, and I am confident she will not pass the exam,since she can't express herself well and doesn't know basic grammar. I was hoping she would spend those last few days studying for the exam, but boy was I wrong. She texted me, saying that her teacher from the language centre made her solve some exercises, and she can't solve them so obviously, I have to solve them for her. I solved like an exercise or two, and I told her that she should probably try to solve the rest of the exercises herself, since the exams are coming up and she needs to practice. She then begged me to solve them because she is too bored to solve them herself.
Even though the exercises are relatively easy, they are far too many and it would take me quite some time to solve them.Not to mention that it is finals season, and I have to study for my school exams. I have to take a political studies exam soon and I have to study for it, I don't have time to do my friend's homework.
I feel guilty for not helping her because even though I find the exercises to be quite easy, she has dyslexia and I know it can be hard for her to solve them. On the other hand, I don't have the time to help her and solving every exercise for her won't help her practice. What do you guys think?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwrgvr	2019-06-04 17:31:39	faceofu	WIBTA if I didn’t buy a present for my friend’s birthday?	"In a couple weeks, it’s my friend’s birthday and, shortly after, mine. Last year, my friend came to my birthday without a present and told me she had forgotten it at her house.

After like half a year, (in which she kept forgetting to bring me my present) I went to her house to hang out, and then I asked her about it (just to clarify, I did not go to her house to get the present, we were hanging out with my group of friends and I remembered). She told me she still had the present, but she had decided to keep it. Then I asked if she could show it to me. It was a T-shirt. I suspected that she didn’t actually buy that T-shirt as my present since it was her size, not mine. When I asked her she said it was because I tend to wear oversized shirts, which I guess is kind of true. Anyways, she refused to give me the shirt and to this day I don’t have a present.

It’s not that the present was really important to me, I don’t care what she gets me, it’s just the gesture, I feel like it’s unfair that she didn’t get me a present after I got her one, and it is not the first time she does this, but she doesn’t seem like is gonna change this attitude any time soon. 

She often uses excuses such as “I don’t have money”, but then she’ll go on and spend a lot on books or clothes or cosplays or whatever. It is her money and she can spend it on whatever she wants, I don’t care, but she does this and still expects to get presents on her birthday from other people.

Despite all of this, I feel like not getting her a present is kind of pitiful on my side, specially because I still expect her to get me one this year, but I can’t help but feel it is unfair. So WIBTA?

Edit: For some context, we’re 19 turning 20. Getting a birthday present in our group of friends is expected, even if you don’t have the money, you give something you made, since the person who the birthday is for is the one paying for everything (dinner and whatever activity we might do)."

bwrgmk	2019-06-04 17:31:06	Amandabear323	AITA for possibly scaring a cyclist on the road?	"For some background, I have a job that requires me to travel between clients homes and making it on time to appointments which  depends heavily on traffic patterns. 

Today I was stopped for some construction at an intersection, I'm stopped about 500 feet back from the light waiting for the police officer to wave me through once the forward lane was cleared after the light turned green. While waiting there a bicyclist comes up and stops maybe 3 feet behind the rear bumper of my vehicle. I am not in the cyclists lane as we're stopped waiting to be waived on by the police officer. We'll, a fire truck comes from behind us so I need to pull over. The traffic law in my state is to pull over into the cyclist lane. The cyclist did not have to move forward he was safe where he was. I moved forward and into the cyclist lane. The fire truck passes, the police officer waves me on to stop at the light. I need to take a right hand turn which I cannot do at this intersection (no right on red) the cyclist comes past me, goes up onto the sidewalk which is illegal for cyclist, and hits the crosswalk button but continues on his way to the right. As he does he flips me off. Now I'm quite upset because at this point no one has to cross the road but it's a 35 second timer. I get to make my right hand turn. Eventually I catch up to him because I'm in a car. I pass him and give him four and a half feet clearance, at which point half my vehicle is into oncoming traffic but it is safe to do so but I honk my horn and flip him off.

Am I the asshole.

The cyclist didn't startle, or sway, he continued on his way, but I realized after this could be dangerous for him"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bwrga7	2019-06-04 17:30:23	brurneracct_AITA	AITA for not cleaning this?	"I got a fancy new espresso maker to replace our very old cheapo Krups machine. My wife was fine with the old espresso maker, even though it leaked terribly over the countertops and made pretty bad espresso to boot.  The new machine is way more expensive but makes way less of a mess. As a compromise though, I agreed to be responsible to clean up after the new machine. I do regular maintenance on it now, like back-flushing the system and emptying the water-collection trays when they fill up. 

&#x200B;

My wife is upset though, that the kitchen and countertops aren't ""clean"" and says I didn't hold up my end of the compromise.  Attached are photos. I don't think it's messy enough to warrant cleaning, and like I said, I'm cleaning up the actual machine so it doesn't break. I think she is overreacting and being overly picky. Also to mention is that I work full-time and also as much time as possible on a side hobby/project that I intend to monetize. She doesn't work per se but is training to be a classical musician and so is, from my point of view, responsible for cleaning. She says she doesn't mind ""normal"" cleaning but thinks people in any household should generally pick up after themselves. AITA or is she for making a big fuss over nothing?

bwrfyk	2019-06-04 17:29:34	brianEnoFan	AITA for losing my cool with a ridiculously condescending teamwork trainer?	"I am not someone who loses their cool. But this morning somebody pushed all my buttons and I reacted.

I work in IT for a corporation that you might well have heard of. I have no desire for the corporation or myself to be identified. This corp is large enough to have their own full-time team-building trainers who fall under the umbrella of the HR department. They do other stuff like organizing social events and managing our internal events website. They are both in their early to mid twenties, one guy, one girl. They are responsible for lots of awareness raising, themed days, awful little videos about how nice our corporation is to its employees, etc. Absolute fluff of the highest order.

I'm happy to say they have been off my radar for most of my tenure at the company. That is until this morning's ""Team Dynamics"" event that they call ""Horizon"" for reasons unknown.

The altercation: at one point in this grueling 3-hour event they asked people to get on all fours and bark like dogs. They insisted on it. I should add that this pair of chuckleheads record absolutely everything they do so they can cut it together for the corporate news site, so the girl was in the corner with her camera rolling. This was the final straw for me after a morning of increasingly ridiculous shit designed to 'get us out of our shells'.

I said no, I'm not doing that, and I moved to the back of the boardroom. A few others saw what I was doing and got up off their stinky yoga mats to do the same thing. Chucklehead senior--let's call him David--sees this and rushes up to me with a big grin. David says something like ""everybody's doing it, don't be a spoilsport"". I told him it was not something I was willing to do. I tried to make a joke of it but he wasn't having it. Voices got raised and he asked again a couple of times, he even tried to take me by the upper arm and lead me back to my place.

""Look, anyone who doesn't get involved is getting a verbal warning,"" he says, looking around for support. Was he joking? Maybe.

I flipped. I told him I had 17 years of industry experience and a department that relied on me to function, and he had a polo shirt and a fucking whistle. I stumbled over some of the words but that was the gist. Then I stormed out and slammed the door.

I heard laughter from the meeting room and then a chorus of obedient dog barking from my colleagues. I went out to my car to fume. I had Brian Eno pumping to try to calm down, just watching the birds. Wouldn't you know, an urgent meeting request arrived for this afternoon to discuss my ""disruptive and abusive"" behavior. This made me flip out again. I was purple from the neck up.

Those teambuilders eat their lunch with HR every day so there's no winning this. I'm telling them to stick the job if they try to make me out to be some kind of nut.

Could I have handled it better without obeying these dumbasses? I should just have walked out without a word but I lost my cool."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So recently my work (grocery store bakery) changed my shifts from 11:30-8 with a lunch at 3:30, to 12:30-9 with a lunch at 4:30. The issue is is that all of the bakery staff are gone by 4. 

This means I either have to take my lunch an hour early or take it an hour later when the store isn’t busy. I choose to take it later, the issue is that for a half hour the people at the customer service desk have to come and help and that makes it busy for them. I feel a little bit upset at masking them work harder but I don’t feel like I should have to take my lunch super early. At the end of the day I feel like management should make sure that someone’s there when I take my break.

bwrcow	2019-06-04 17:22:00		WIBTA for refusing to pay my former roommate my half for a charge from our internet provider	"A bit of backstory: Last year, during my third year of university, I lived in a 2br apartment with an acquaintance of mine. He's a nice guy but a bit ditzy at times, which leads him to say and do some mildly frustrating things that I always let slide because he has a slightly higher standard for tidiness than me and I felt it was fair since he never gave me shit about leaving my coat on the couch or plates in the sink, etc. 

Today he sent me a text saying that our internet provider charged him $35 for not returning our router after we cancelled service. Although it wouldn't be expensive to just pay half, this really bugged me for a few reasons.

The router they initially gave us was terrible so I spent $100 of my own money on a much better one that made our wifi significantly more usable, which I kept when we moved out. At some point the one that our provider gave us went missing, and even when the apartment was entirely empty before I moved out I couldn't find it anywhere. Since he can be a bit ditzy sometimes, I think it's totally plausible that he would have just thrown it away and forgotten about it. Even though I can't remember what happened to it either, I would never purposely get rid of something like that without making sure it was safe with our provider.

I also had to be the one to return the modem when I left since he moved out a few weeks before me, and he sent me one of our monthly bills (account was in his name) to bring with it and I saw that we were charged $4 a month to rent the router that we weren't even using, and he never noticed. 

This last part is slightly unrelated but he texted me a day before my last exam to tell me that he cancelled the service and it would be cutting out the next day, but when I got home that afternoon it was already out. This bugged me as well since I was staying an extra week to move and probably would have paid for the full month on my own if he had consulted me earlier.

WIBTA if I just told him this was his problem for not being more mindful of it, not checking the provider's policy, and not realizing we were being billed for renting it every month?"		1	0
bwrcig	2019-06-04 17:21:32	PhantomWolfZero	AITA for not going to a family breakfast?	"So I’m currently working and investing on a project at the moment which can and has pulled me away from the house quite frequently. Needless to say it’s extremely important to me and to the others involved so side tracking days and last minute cancellations really put a dent in our progress.

That being said apparently there’s this family breakfast that’s been planned for a couple weeks now and it’s ideal of everyone shows because no one sees enough of the extended family. Everyone in my house is at work or school so no one is ever home at the same time. 

Fast forward to the day of the breakfast. I should also make it known I had no prior knowledge of this even happening I was literally woken up and told to get dressed were going to a breakfast with the family. With my luck, this breakfast just so happened landed on the same day of an appointment important to my current project. As I stated before, side tracking and last minute cancellations is an extreme inconvenience especially with the money people have invested as of recently. I was meeting with a prospective angel investor from out of town who was interested in being apart of our project.  He was only in town for that day and it was important that we met in person to discuss things or I’d risk losing out on a potential investor. I also had to pick up and test equipment that day but that was later in the day.

So I tell my family I can’t go because I had previous commitments. Immediately I get berated like there’s no tomorrow, being told that I’m a terrible son for not putting family first and not going to see other family who I guess hasn’t been doing well. As I said before, no one told me anything prior to that morning I literally found out the moment I was woken up. If the breakfast didn’t overlap times with my appointment then I would’ve gone no problem but it did and I couldn’t make any compromises to make it work. 

So apparently I’m the asshole of the house now for not going. I’ve been thrown the utmost amount shade for it and I’m pretty sure I’m not going to hear the end of it anytime soon. I’m guilt tripped constantly. I’m told that if something happens to one of the family members that isn’t doing well, I’m going to feel like shit for not going.

What bothers me the most however is that no one told me anything and when they did it was last minute so I feel like I’m not in the wrong here. Or am I still the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I run a small YouTube channel that helps other users with programming for specific video games. The community and its developers have a general toxic behavior that involves mostly laughing at others, not answering questions in a serious manner, and quite literally calling other people retards. I separated myself from the Discord and began promoting a second Discord for serious development heads and have gotten nothing but praise for making this separate Discord. I have since produced around 50 or so videos in two or three months covering various topics regarding this one game.

&#x200B;

We've had a steady couple of months of existence and I decided to move the Discord towards a scaling theme. Instead of focusing on one specific game; I branched out. I began supporting two other video games for programming as well. Immediately after I began branching out I was banned from the other Discord, and their forums. The general consensus is that I was splitting up the community, causing problems, and doing too much self promotion. As a content creator on YouTube; I don't understand the logic here.

I work at a custom holster shop where I make hand crafted holsters for pretty much any holsterable fire arm you can think of with pretty much and light, laser,  barrel or sight combination.

I recently made a holster for a customer and on his order it specified the following. GUN MAKE AND MODEL, RMR, suppressor sights, and THREADED BARREL! 

It never mentioned a compensator on the end of the barrel. So I made the holster and sent it to the Customer. About a week or two later the customer had returned it stating that it didn’t fit because he had a compensator. I explained to him the process that I could do to make it work but it would leave the end of the barrel exposed. Or I could simply remake it.  However remaking it I don’t get paid and the company loses money because of shipping and material cost. Which means I lose my time and money by having to spend extra time re making it.
 
He said it would be fine to open the end so I did and sent him pictures. A little while later he responded and demanded that I remake the holster. Stating that it was 100% my fault that the holster was wrong. He then began to swear at me and said we could either refund him or remake it. I told him no problem I would remake it. Thought I didn’t tell him that it was going to take an extra week or two for his holster. I simply hung up the phone and placed his order at the back of my list and am forcing him to wait another two weeks before I even remake the holster.

AITA for making him wait longer. Or is he because he got rude with me for something that was simply his fault for not specifying the first time."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"A few months ago a friend of ours asked my and my boyfriend if we liked a certain piece of furniture they retrieved from his grandfathers home, as we just moved house and needed certain things. We loved it and said yes. There was no mention of having to pay anything for it, but we were willing to do so. 

Because of distance, we didn't get around to seeing it live in person until last weekend. We saw the piece of furniture and really loved it, it was exactly what we wanted. It was in near perfect condition, even though it's vintage. We asked how much he wanted for it, because it was in such a good state. We agreed on a low price and went on with our day. We would have to wait a while before we could transport it to our place. 

Fast forward to today, and the friend suddenly backtracked on our agreement, saying he'd rather keep the piece of furniture himself. Turns out the thing is worth a little bit of money and he even put it up on our country's equivalent of craigslist. We found it there, because we know him longer than today. 

AITA for being angry at our friend? I am pretty conflicted about it, because it's a piece of furniture from his deceased grandfather (even though he didn't seem emotional about that part), and it's a pretty neat vintage piece of furniture worth a bit of money. He has every right to keep or sell it as he pleases. 

But I feel pretty annoyed about the fact that he led us on for so long, as we were genuinely looking forward to buying it from him. And we were also very willing to pay more for it, he knows we would as we make enough to do so. The fact that he put in on craigslist made it even worse.

I work in a nursing home and people are always donating things, which I love but honestly hate to deal with sometimes.

They called beforehand and asked if they could pass them out. I said sure. They rescheduled twice and could only make it at a time that was super inconvenient, but since they wanted to pass them out, no biggie. They got there and had everything neatly organized but decided not only were they not going to pass them out, but they also wanted their boxes back right then. I don't just have boxes laying around everywhere, so I just had to dump everything in a bag because they are impatiently waiting for their boxes back.

I’m 15(f) and I currently live with my Grandma. I’m aware the title probably makes me sound entitled but withhold your angry swords,

So.
I have this cup. 
To not slap too much of a sob story on here it’s important to me, and I’ve asked for it not to be used by anyone else. Until today it hadn’t been. 

We had ‘guest’ round, and my Grandma offered to make him coffee, and began using my mug. I pointed it out, to which she apologised but continued to use it. Then, upon realising I didn’t like people using it, the ‘guest’ proceeded to take the cup and lick it up and down to spite me. I said ‘but he’s licking it!’ Because by god he was, to which I was met with a scolding and a telling off. He drank his coffee.

My grandma insists I shouldn’t have pointed it out in case I ‘embarrassed’ our ‘guest’ and that since it was the biggest cup it would have been rude of me to not let them use it.

We loved it and said yes. There was no mention of having to pay anything for it, but we were willing to do so. 

Because of distance, we didn't get around to seeing it live in person until last weekend. We saw the piece of furniture and really loved it, it was exactly what we wanted. It was in near perfect condition, even though it's vintage. We asked how much he wanted for it, because it was in such a good state. We agreed on a low price and went on with our day. We would have to wait a while before we could transport it to our place. 

Fast forward to today, and the friend suddenly backtracked on our agreement, saying he'd rather keep the piece of furniture himself. Turns out the thing is worth a little bit of money and he even put it up on our country's equivalent of craigslist. We found it there, because we know him longer than today. 

AITA for being angry at our friend? I am pretty conflicted about it, because it's a piece of furniture from his deceased grandfather (even though he didn't seem emotional about that part), and it's a pretty neat vintage piece of furniture worth a bit of money. He has every right to keep or sell it as he pleases. 

But I feel pretty annoyed about the fact that he led us on for so long, as we were genuinely looking forward to buying it from him. And we were also very willing to pay more for it, he knows we would as we make enough to do so. The fact that he put in on craigslist made it even worse. But I feel petty to be angry about something that wasn't even mine to begin with, and just a promise?"		0	0

bwr122	2019-06-04 16:54:54	coffeandt-v	AITA for telling my best friend this guy is not interested in her?	"My best friend has been on and off “dating” this guy she met off Tinder for nearly a year (they’re both in their early 20s). Although at first, he wasn’t being straightforward, he’s now told her that he doesn’t want anything serious even though she’s clearly in love with him (and tells me so all the time!) She spends money buying him gifts, thinking of thoughtful things for them to do when they hang out, and overall just treats him super well. This guy strikes me as a player, though (for reference, he sent my friend a sext meant for another girl, and he also is constantly texting other girls when they’re together), and while I do think he should stop seeing my friend because he’s leading her on (he will hold her hand or they’ll hook up sometimes), he DID tell her a few times that he didn’t want a girlfriend or anything serious from her. He even told my friend that she should see other men. All the while, he briefly even had a different girlfriend in this time period. 

Anyway, after EVERY time they hang, my friend recounts their entire date in detail as if she’s trying to convince me to say, “I think he really likes you” or “seems like he wants to date you now!” She always takes some small sign as a major indicator of his being changed. But I always tell her the truth, that to me, no matter how much he flirts or agrees to hang out with her or even if they hook up or whatever, the fact that he doesn’t want to commit to her and openly messages other girls while she’s around PROVES that he hasn’t changed his mind... not until he EXPLICITLY says otherwise. 

I feel like the worst person every time I have to crush her hopeful spirit, but I don’t want to lie to her and have her believe there’s a chance when he’s pretty clearly shown that there’s no chance. I feel like this guy has created tension in our friendship because she talks about him constantly, and I almost hate talking about him because I always have to let her down.

bwqz1a	2019-06-04 16:49:57	Minijabber	AITA for wanting to have a 'boring' birthday.	"So my partner had this idea that he would take me on a day trip to somewhere for my birthday. I get notion that he is planning something like that and simply say all I want is a film, a dinner and a nice evening. I will be working on my actual birthday but have the weekend immediately after off and all I want to do is have a chilled out time. 

I should mention I really really do not like traveling and day trips anywhere are pretty much the last thing I would want to do. I said this to my partner and he is now angry with me saying that I shouldn't be sat around being boring and he does not want to spend one of my only weekends off like that and he just wants to do something nice and I that I have no idea what he would have planned when we got there. (Before you think it there is no chance of him having planned to propose as we agreed no marriage recently) 

He has now shut himself in the other room after this blew up into a fight where I said that what he planned is what he wants to do not me and that I don't want to go on a day trip or anything of the sort. Yes I am boring. Yes for his birthday we can go away and do whatever he wants but it's my birthday and I simply want to relax!

 Now I feel bad that whatever plans he was making is now in the gutter but I don't understand why he would ever think that is something I would want to do. I have said countless times that in an ideal world I would have a spa day and then go out for a movie or something. That to me is a perfect birthday and I don't care if it's boring. Still I feel bad.

After asking her for three days what time we would be getting there and telling her to “please not be late” because she is habitually late every time we do something . We finally settled on 1:30 pm and today is the day of the concert . This morning she tells me that she won’t be getting here until 3:00 pm with no further explanation.

bwqyfh	2019-06-04 16:48:29		AITA for telling my brother to stop touching me even after I say no.	"My brother is 14 and I'm 17. Ever since we were kids, we'd always fight or hit each other, it turned into playfully spanking each other or hitting each other. Since a while though, my brother has turned to insisting he gets to kiss me or hug me while he says it in a weird way, ""Can I kiss?"" while drawing out the kiss part. 

I usually say no. He pushes on it, over and over again until I let him or until I scream at it him to stop and that it makes me uncomfortable. Then he sulks and lashes out passive aggressively for a bit. I usually apologize for some reason.My mother thinks that since we used to playfully hit each other, it means that I'm allowing the behaviour to continue. That isn't exactly it, I just want it to stop when I'm saying stop. If my brother asked me to stop, I'd do it. And I do do that. 

Today my brother accidentally or purposely touched me in a weird area. I was immediately pissed but I gave it the benefit of doubt. Then he kept asking if he can kiss my leg, to which I said no and he said ""just a little one."" And then proceeded to do it anyway. I got mad and left the room. Now my mother is upset and texting me, saying, ""Wow, punishing me despite doing nothing. Thanks. Great."" But what the fuck, is it so wrong I go somewhere else to cool down?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

In the process of grabbing the pad I accidentally knocked the dishwashers hidden phone onto the work surface and it shattered/broke the screen. I felt bad that I was directly the cause of it breaking however they had it hidden where I didn't know to avoid it. I offered to split the cost of a new screen since it was sorta both our faults. This is where the asshole part comes. Since they didn't have like a mainstream phone there is nowhere to get a screen fixed so he has to buy a whole new one which will cost way more than I wanted to help out with.

bwqy5n	2019-06-04 16:47:49	lanadewix	"AITA for ""ruining my mom's relationship""?"	"Obligatory ""I'm on mobile"". Keeping this short because whenever I type out the full story it either includes things that aren't allowed or exceeds the 3k limit, feel free to ask questions if something is unclear, though.

Basically because of a trauma (due to things I'm not allowed to post about on this subreddit) I can't sleep with guys in the house. I'm aware that ""not all men"" but I can't convince myself of that during a night terror or anxiety attack. So basically, long story short, my mom's ex couldn't stay over at our place ever because when he did (all the time when they first started dating) I almost got admitted to a mental health place by my therapist because of how quickly my mental health started deteriorating. It was either that or the ex not staying over anymore so I could sleep again and get back the energy to continue working on my shit. My mom eventually caved in when my therapist pressed her, but she was never very okay with her ex not being able to stay over. (Yet when alternatives were mentioned, she wouldn't hear of them.)

Because of this my mom and her ex only saw each other on the weekends, as my mom couldn't reach her job from his place. She doesn't have a driver's licence, so she relies on public transport. Despite this, mom and ex lasted 2-ish more years before finally breaking up over what I thought were unrelated reasons.

My mom and I got into a huge fight the other day.  She told me I was responsible for breaking up her and her ex. I don't feel particularly responsible as I can't control my mental health and have tried for years with therapy. Plus, as I reminded her, when things started going bad and she started accusing me I told her to just let him come over, and I'd deal with it. She never took me up on this. Lots of things were mentioned and we both sucked during that fight but this was really the thing that stuck with me.

I don't feel responsible and in fact got angry with her for saying that I am, but she insisted I am entitled for ""not allowing"" guys over.

So, reddit, AITA?

Edit: Yes I am an adult (20). No I can't move out rn. Also this is an argument that existed LONG before they broke up. Ex not being able to stay over was a sore spot between the three of us from the moment it started."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We mainly do it just for fun and it's not necessarily a problem. However we recently won a Jackpot which was very unexpected and this totalled nearly £300,000. We were playing on my account and I was streaming to him what was happening through discord.   


It rolled in and we won, we were literraly screaming with excitement. Nearly £150,000 each! He said he wanted to keep going highering the stakes to win even more. I tried to tell him what he could do with that money but he wanted to stake silly amounts on roulette and BJ.   


I simply told him no and cashed out, he was so pissed off and was accusing me that I was going to steal his money, which I am not, I have known this guy for years and he's my best friend. I now have this money and am going to give him his half but I'm scared he's going to blow it all.

bwqwk6	2019-06-04 16:44:01	pluckinglilies	AITA for not kicking a work friend out of my life because my wife doesn't like him.	"The title pretty much sums it up, but I'm going to give you some background into how this problem even became a problem. My wife hates men. Like genuinely hates men. I, however, get along with men way more than woman because they are less catty. We both work at the same big grocery store company, but different departments. She is friends with everyone in her department (which is larger than mine), and I have made friends in other departments that occasionally come out and chat for a few minutes before getting back to work. 

This one particular dude that comes in and chats, my wife can't stand, because she feels he ignores her when she's in the room and only talks to me. She didnt express this to me until a few days ago, which once I was informed I pulled dude aside and pretty much was like ""Hey my wife feels that you ignore her and only talk to me which is making her uncomfortable"". He apologized and explained that it wasn't anything malicious and he's married (which I knew and didn't think any of our interactions were overstepping boundaries). He pretty much just said that he's intimidated by her and didn't know how to approach her, that's why he didn't say much to her, but he promised to make an effort to get to know her as well so she wouldn't be uncomfortable anymore. 

That brings us to today, where she came in on her break as he was in my part of the store telling me of this promotion they just offered him. He greeted her the same way he does me everyday and asked about the new car I told him we were picking up today for her. She completely ignores him, and storms out of the area. She waited until he left to come back in and ask if I was mad at her. I responded that yes I was mad because that was completely rude and I shouldn't be expected to drop every friend that she dislikes. ESPECIALLY AFTER I CORRECTED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.

bwqvr0	2019-06-04 16:42:03	aitathrowaway_	AITA for not telling my FWB I'm casually dating?	"Throwaway.

I'm friends with benefits with a friend from college. We live in different states but are in each other's cities a several times a year for work. We keep in casual friendly (non-sexual) contact the rest of the time, mostly in a group chat with mutual friends. When we're in the same city we hook up. We've both been clear from the beginning that this is a purely friendship-and-sex situation, no romantic feelings or commitment. We wouldn't be compatible romantically for a million reasons and neither of us is actually interested in dating the other, but we're good friends and the sex is nice.

I've been dating casually this whole time. Here and there, not all the time - a big part of the reason we started this setup was because we're both really focused on our careers and unwilling to put the time into dating properly. I don't really talk to my friends about it because it's very casual and sparse and I like to play my love life close to the vest, so I didn't explicitly tell him this, but I thought he knew and assumed he was doing the same.

Recently I met somebody that I would like to try to be more serious with. It's new and we're not making any big commitments, but it's at the point where I would feel inappropriate dating/sleeping around and expect to have that ""exclusive"" conversation soon. So I gave FWB a heads up that I'm dating somebody, just so he knows that when he comes to town next time we won't be hooking up. And also because now that I have some actual news to report on the romance front, I thought he'd like to know, as my friend.

He got upset. He said he had no idea that I had been dating at all, and that he hasn't been dating. He is mad that he missed so many ""opportunities"" (the way he said this is suspect to me but ok) because he thought he wasn't supposed to be dating. I \*never\* made that request of him and we have discussed that our situation is purely no-strings-attached over and over. We were careful to have boundaries and to be clear with each other that this is NSA.

At first I thought that maybe he was upset because he thought I'd been sleeping around and might give him STDs or something. This seemed like a fair concern to me so I told him that I hadn't been having sex in between our encounters, just going on dates (not one for casual sex with strangers). New partner is the first person I've had sex with since we began our FWBship, and if things had fizzled I would have told FWB about this before we hooked up again.

BUT that wasn't his issue. He really just has a problem with the fact that I've been dating, ""feels like a chump,"" and feels like he ""missed out on opportunities."" I feel like this isn't my fault. It was obviously implied that we could both date this whole time. We live in different states and this is casual. I feel there was no room for confusion here, and he is being unfair. He thinks I've betrayed him. What is your take?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I got my permit years ago but my mother just refused to teach me because of her ""anxiety"", and no one else in the family seems to have time to help me since I've asked multiple people multiple times with no results. Due to living in a house with 6 people in it as well as having no friends in my hometown because my mother pulled me out of public school, I am frequently depressed & sometimes don't leave my room for days.

My mother is frequently manipulative to try and get me to stay. When I told her I wanted to go out there, she cried for hours on end. That's not something I care about and is normal, but she literally immediately told everyone in our close family to talk to me to try to get me to stay. This was about 6 months ago & I ended up staying. I recently visited Colorado despite her crying and guilt tripping to see if I would like it out there & worked at the Jersey Mike's and I'm pretty convinced this could be a good move for me in my life.

bwqswl	2019-06-04 16:35:19	starri_ski3	AITA - my mother is upset with me because my husband and I are considering moving to another state instead of next door to her.	"A little backstory. Newly married and pregnant. Lucky wedding night. Lol. 

My family loves my husband, sometimes I think they like him more than me! Anyways, we currently rent in California as buying here is insanely expensive. My husband is an attorney and I work for the government, but we plan to have me stay home for a while once the baby is born. On my husband’s salary alone we’d only ever be able to afford an apartment if we stay in CA. Any house we could afford here is not the type of home we incision raising our children in. 

We plan on moving out of state where, not only is housing affordable, my husband would make more money, allowing me to stay home a little longer and not stress so much about hurrying back to work. We’ve spoke extensively about this plan and are set in our decision. 

My mother, on the other hand, wants us to move into one of the homes for sale in her neighborhood. They are well out of our price range, over and hour and a half commute to hubby’s work, and not the kind of houses we want to live in anyways. Plus! They’re too close to my mother, whom I love dearly, but can only take in small doses. 

My mother will not let this go. It’s gotten to the point of her yelling at me, in front of my In-laws, and telling me I’m not going to make it as a mother on my own in a city where I don’t have help. Never mind that I’ll have a loving and supportive husband and all the friends I could ever need at the tip of my social media platforms. 

I’ve become so frustrated with her that I yelled back and told her “fine, you want us to stay? Buy us a house!” She didn’t like that response and replied that she tried helping us get a house right next to her. Her idea of help, I guess, is telling us over and over there’s a house for sale. 

At this point I’m reluctant to spend any time with her at all as this is driving me away from her. We typically spend one night a week together for dinner and sometimes we go over to hang out at the pool on the weekends. I’m pushing my husband to move up our move date to avoid any further conflict with my mother."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So me and my S/O saved some cash aside short notice to go out of town for my s/o cousins high school graduation. Which I didn’t mind doing because he is an excellent young adult.  Well we had enough for gas, to get over there and back and for a gift, and of course money to get our kids whatever they might need. Which was formula, pampers, wipes, food.


We get to my S/O Mother’s house, (she got fired from her job months ago because she no longer felt the need to show up) and she tells us she has no money for groceries for her new boyfriends daughter (she has autism) so her grocery list is very specific and VERY pricey. Well her new boyfriend isn’t working either, but somehow they have four new bottles of CROWN and huge bulk boxes of Marlboro cigarettes stored in the freezer.

So then she tells us to go to the grocery store ( she doesn’t ask, she tells) to get these groceries for a child we just met literally then and there.  By the time we get back to her house, we find out she had left to the bar and calls me and says she can’t find the cash my s/o loaned to her (I had no idea he did that) we needed to meet her to give her some more. 

By the time we get back from dealing with all this bullshit, I’m exhausted and quite annoyed because now I can’t even afford to get my daughter what she needs, or we can’t afford to give his cousin a graduation present. Because we now need it for gas to go back home. So my s/o mother says, “ why don’t you ask your grandparents to western union you some”like first of all they would but it’s like why the fuck should I even have to ask for them to do that?

I know it sounds shitty, but I would’ve had no problem helping the little girl,but why couldn’t her father do so? Why couldn’t they work to get their needs like I did? Why do I have to ask for help because I had to unwillingly sacrifice my daughters funds just so that little girl wouldn’t be hungry."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Since there’s so many of us and we all don’t have iPhones, most of our conversations that aren’t in person are over Snapchat. We have a lot of fun here and we can always reach other just like that. We have so far two group chats, one with all 12 of us and another with only the guys of the group so 6 of us. 

This group chat was started by another guy in the group when he wanted to get our opinions on stuff that he felt he could only really talk about with his guy friends and I understood. It started off with a lot of jokes but right now, we have this sense of brotherhood when it comes to venting in the chat. Now I have this guy friend who asked if one of our friends, whose a girl, join the chat. I said no. I didn’t understand why. We have a group chat with her and the rest of the group in it already and I told her she’s not missing much.

Last month, the friend that’s trying to add her in added in this complete asshat to our group to say the least and now we can’t talk as freely and it sucks. Yeah, we could always make a new chat but I don’t think everyone else would want to many chats and I mean, it’s guys only like I explained to her but apparently her liking girls is even for her to get in according to her (which makes no sense because I’m gay). She’s been asking me almost everyday now for the past week and I saw her in person recently and told her no again. Now she’s pestering me about how she’s entitled to be in the chat with us and it’s starting to get on my nerves.

She’s 22 and engaged to a 34 year old man who has a seven year old child. BFF fits great into their family unit, the daughter loves her, all is swell. But she undermines / attempts to take the place of the child’s mother constantly. It’s weird and frankly uncalled for.

For example, bff will post a picture of her and stepdaughter on Facebook with the captions like “there are no STEPS and HALFS in parenthood. Just moms and dads!” Or “i could be the typical stepmom, or I could just be the best parent I can be! The other day she told me I’m ‘just her mommy’ and best friend! *heart eyes*”

Seeing her around her fiancé and stepdaughter makes it obvious that she puts the idea in this girl’s head to call her “mommy” and to stop telling people that she is a stepparent. If the actual mom gets brought up in conversation, BFF will quickly switch topics. It’s like she wants to erase Mom from the kid’s “family picture”.

I know it isn’t my business, but it seems so damn wrong to me, and it pushes the daughter’s real mother (who is very much around, and very much involved in her daughter’s life) by the sideline. I also feel that it has to be confusing for the child.

"My friends and I know each other for a few good years and everything was always good within us since we are all together, but this year a new girl joined our class and since then everyone of them just go around here every place she goes,

It got to a point that the only time we see each other is when she is with us and because of that all I started nothing a behavioral change with them.

They started to be loud semi edgy and always trying to be as the image she like.

All of this made us come apart and made me not wanting to be around them at all so I stopped being with them and in a time I started hating them.

I don't have a big problem with the girl she is fine with me and all and I haven't done anything in particular to hurt them but I feel bad cutting our friendship because of that.

bwqp8i	2019-06-04 16:26:54		AITA for not wanting anything to do with my sister in law and her new baby because of the baby's name?	"For simplicity sake I'll be using the following abbreviations:

SIL - Sister in law (wife's sister)
MIL - mother in law

My wife and I have been together for 6 years now, married for 3. We are both midtwenties and we only recently started trying to have kids as we weren't in the best financial situation until now.  We have always wanted kids and it has been we discussed even early on in our relationship.  In several of those conversations we discussed names that we like for both boys and girls. We are both open to a lot of names but we decided that there was one girl name we liked more than any and if we ever had a daughter we would name her Amelia.  

My SIL is several years older than us and already has one child. I've had my issues with her before but nothing outside if the norm of dealing with in laws (long story short she constantly tells my wife she needs to get me to go to church because otherwise I'm not worthy of being her sisters husband. I've had bad experiences with church and am not religious).  She has also been very judgemental of  other family members when they name their children anything close to names they like.  She became pregnant again a and talked to my wife and I about names they were considering for their next child.  She  asked if there were any names we liked for when we wanted to start having children. We mentioned a few of our favorites but definitely made a point about Amelia being our favorite. She said it was a pretty name and then told us all the names she was considering, which were different from ours.

Fast forward to yesterday when she had her baby. They had a girl and we find out they named her Amelie.  I was livid when I heard this. When we saw my SIL  with her child,after a while I asked politley why she decided to choose that name.  She said she remembered us telling her about names we liked and it was just so pretty and it wasn't the same name so she didn't think it was a big deal.  My MIL said that we didn't even have kids yet so we shouldn't be able to pick names ahead of time. I told my wife I was leaving the hospital and waited in the car for her to leave 

My wife and I talked after and she mentioned that my SIL wanted to ask me to be the godfather of their daughter even though I was ""extremely rude"". I told her not only did I not want to be her godfather but I didn't really want anything to do with her, my SIL or her other kids anymore cause this was just the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  I get it's just a name but I feel like this was blatantly inconsiderate of my SIL and I have every right to be angry.  My wife says ITA for even saying such things and that we should just change the spelling or choose a new name.

Tl;Dr - SIL named new daughter a name one letter different from my wife and I's favorite girls name, knowing we loved that name and were trying to get pregnant. I want nothing to do with my SIL or my new niece because of it."		1	0
bwqohv	2019-06-04 16:25:07	ChaseH9499	AITA for reflexively kicking my girlfriend in the face and not feeling like I was wrong?	"Some context is needed for a post with such a “holy shit” title. My girlfriend and I like to mess with each other a lot. I love to tickle her to the point she can’t breathe, and she likes to bite me and slap my groin (non sexual way). I don’t have a problem with it, it’s funny and kinda exhilarating to be honest.

Last night, she was sitting between my legs, facing me, while I was lying on my back. We were messing around and she jabbed me in the taint. Reflexively, I extended my legs and ended up kicking her in the face pretty hard. She was understandably in some pain, and I felt bad. But then she got super pissed at me, and made me go into another room for an hour or so. I told her I felt it was ridiculous for her to be mad at me over it, considering she indirectly caused it by triggering that reflex.

So basically, do I deserve for her to be mad at me?

TLDR: Girlfriend triggered physical reflex that made me kick her in the face (accidentally of course). She’s mad at me, I feel like it’s not my fault."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

The job was repetitive, had little room for growth and I had to work with female bosses that were, in my opinion, passive-aggressive. I don't claim I was a model employee but the job nor the colleagues were a good fit to me. It took me a while for me to recover from the work environment I was in. 

I found another job a few months later in a different field and basically never looked back, apart from scrolling LinkedIn and watching the evens of my ex-company and without liking any posts. I have no interest in actually talking to my ex-colleagues or bosses.

bwqmnc	2019-06-04 16:20:43	Dogethrowaway45	AITA for getting a dog?	"Obligatory mobile disclosure, throw away etc. most of this was last year but I just found this sub recently.

So, I have 2 roommates, one I have lived with for 5 years, one who’s lived with us for 2. I ALREADY had a dog when roommate #2 moved in.

At the end of 2017, we decided we were gonna get out of the apartment scene and find a house with a yard to rent.

since a yard was required anyway, and I had a new job, I decided I could finally afford to get a dog I’ve been dreaming about since I was a teenager, a rare breed that you have to have been on a waiting list for a year or more to get.

I talked about it with my roommates and they BOTH said OK. With the OK from them I started contacting breeders.

In Feb 2018 I was approved by one.

Due to a literal shortage of rental housing in my city we had trouble finding a house to rent, especially ones that would accept the large dog we already had.

After 5 or 6 months of looking we toured one apartment that roommate #2 loved but it was less than 1000sqft, had no yard AND their pet policy said no dogs over 25lbs. I said this apartment wasn’t going to work. #2 lost their mind.

 We had a huge argument between all of us where #2 said that “no household should have more pets than people” and “I never wanted you to get another fucking dog anyway!”

When i said we already had a dog that made this place not work they implied it was my fault we couldn’t find a place and that I should get rid of my dog, because roommate #2 would “give up their cat to get where they needed to be”

later I asked Them why they even said it was ok if they didn’t want me to get the 2nd dog and they said that they just figured I would do it anyway so they didn’t say anything and that they’re afraid of dogs and what if the dogs attack them.

Well here’s the part where idk if ITA. I told #2 that if they had brought up their objections when I first asked permission, I would have been willing to put the Dream dog on hold, but since they hadn’t, and I had been on a list for 6 months, they were going to have to deal with it because I wasn’t backing out now. They said that proved them right.

This fight came up a couple times during house hunting. Roommate #1 never had a problem with me getting the dog.

We never found a place to rent but  #1 bought a house last fall and now #2 and I pay rent to her. We have a fenced yard and more space, and after we moved in I did talk with #1 and make sure she was ok with a 2nd dog in HER house, she said go for it.

The litter I’m getting a puppy from was born last week and there hasn’t been an argument in a while so maybe Roommate 2 has come around..."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwqm6w	2019-06-04 16:19:34	Bubsmith	AITA For not wanting to go on a summer trip to Indonesia?	"For context, my father runs a non profit in which his primary outreach is towards women and girls who suffered from sex trafficking in Indonesia. He travels to Indonesia 3 plus times a year, usually for two weeks at a time. 

This entire trip came about because my father was going to have to take two consecutive trips over seas with very little time in between. So instead my parents decided it would be a good idea to stitch the two together and bring my little sister, my mom, and I. Now here is the deal: I've been with him to Indonesia before. I went with my dad for about two weeks when I was in 6th grade, and it was a really fun trip for me, and genuinely eye opening as I got to experience some of the hardships that befall women in another country. 

The difference between that trip and this one, is that this one is going to be 6 weeks long. Near half my summer vacation. My mother has rented a house in Bali where we are staying for the majority of the time. She's also adamant that we're going to take surfing lessons, despite me expressing a fear of the ocean. 

The trips announcement was fairly abrupt. The tickets were only bought about a month out. I had a lot of plans this summer, especially revolving around competing in Smash Ultimate tournaments with a buddy of mine. 

To clarify, I'm not trying to get out of this trip. I know that's not an option at this point. I haven't fully expressed my feelings about this trip to my parents, only slightly letting on that I was a bit upset about the length of the trip. I guess I just don't want to seem like an ungrateful son. 

TL;DR - my parents are taking me on a 6 week trip to Indonesia, taking up half of my summer vacation. I'm not happy about the length and feel I'll be missing out on events back home."	No A-holes here	0	0

bwql79	2019-06-04 16:17:10		WIBTA for calling my friend out on their annoying behavior while they are on vacation?	"I have this friend, H, who’s away on vacation with family at the moment. H has not been getting along with her family and has a lot of other life stressors that have got her down at the moment. I’ve tried my best to be there for her because I’m really her only close friend. I’m *really* busy with work and school at the moment and I need to focus to make deadlines, but I try to take some time everyday to ask how vacations going and if she wants to talk about anything that’s bothering her. I know it means a lot to her, so I’m okay with sacrificing some time and focus out of my day to talk. 

However, talking to her has been excruciating because she makes a huge deal out of everything and is making the simple act of texting back and forth a whole ordeal. I don’t text her enough, or I text with the wrong tone, or I’m not the one to reach out first and it bothers her. She has some social anxieties and overthinks everything and reads into texts like CRAZY. I used to do that to some degree so I can empathize and I try to adjust my texting. 

Yesterday I reached out first, but she was acting funny and giving short answers so I asked what’s up. H said she didn’t wanna bother me, and I said don’t worry about it I was the one to text her first so I definitely wanted to talk. But the conversation went no where after an hour. I could tell she wanted to talk about things but was holding back, I kept gently prodding her but couldn’t get anything out of her besides a few words or some passive aggressive responses. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I just wasted an hour writing a half-assed chemistry report because I was distracted by trying to interpret her vague texts. I just wanted to let her know I was thinking of her, but no. Couldn’t have a simple conversation back and forth, even after I assured her 6 times I wanted to talk. “I don’t wanna bother you/I’m probably annoying you/no it’s ok I’m fine don’t worry about it” JESUS CHRIST I said I want to talk! I offered to talk later if you weren’t feeling up to talking and you passive aggressively said no! I know if i don’t text you you’ll feel sad/alone! But now that I am texting you the convo is going nowhere and I’m wasting my time!!!!!! No matter what I do, there’s something wrong with the way I text her. I don’t have time for this. 

I want to wait until she comes back to (calmly) talk about how difficult she makes the simple act of texting and how it’s wearing down on me, but the problem is she’s still away for another full week and I know I can’t ignore her that whole time, we’re gonna have to talk again. Idk if I can talk to her normally before she comes back though, I’m so frustrated.

bwqjk3	2019-06-04 16:13:19	18890410	WIBTA if I asked my ex's best friend on a date?	"Backstory: I met my ex (let's call her M) at a party in 2015. We soon became best friends as we and a few other mutual friends hung out all the time. A few months later we hooked up one night and by the summer of 2015 we were in a relationship. 

During our relationship we attended an event where we met L, while I only briefly talked to L and thought she seemed cool M and L really hit it off. 
In the spring of 2016 M dumped me for another guy. I was heartbroken but eventually I moved on and while my friendship with M never was the same we remained friends because of our mutual group of friends.

L and M has since grown very close and are today best friends. 

A month or so ago our group of friends went to a party where both M and L joined us. This was quite rare as M has a small kid (with the guy she left me for) and therefor rarely goes out and drink and L has been going through a few personal issues. 
Without me really realizing it me and L separated us from the others and spent the entire night talking. It was the first time we had a genuine conversation and I was surprised over how much I enjoyed it.

During the night she kissed me at one point, I kind of brushed it off as a drunken mistake and didn't think much of it. 
Since this day we've been texting pretty much every day and I've realized that my feelings for her have been growing.

I do think she likes me aswell but I'm not sure whether to ask her out or just try to ignore my feelings. I do care for my ex (as a friend) and I'm afraid she'll be hurt if I ask her best friend out. 
I mean, even though we've both moved on I wouldn't want my ex and my best friend dating.
On the other hand she's engaged with the guy she left me for so with that in mind she may not mind it?

bwqis4	2019-06-04 16:11:27	shanbie_	AITA for not changing anniversary plans in favor of nanny's plans?	"I'll try to get to the point while giving as much detail as I can. I dont know if my nanny is on reddit but just in case: I'm not trying to bad mouth her or complain about her she's been great. I just want to know if I'm in the wrong.  Some background: we have a nanny who works 3-4 days a week and had been with us a year. She is married and does not live with us. Ocassionally we will have her come over on date nights. In the last year we've had maybe 10 date nights. She also doesn't have to work weekends or holidays unless she agrees to do so for those date nights. Date nights are usually just long enough for quick dinner and a movie so 3-4 hours. Her avg work day is 10-11 hours. 

So my wedding anniversary is tomorrow. We told our nanny a month ago and asked if she'd be available.  At first we were wanting to drive an hour away and spend the day in a large city while she stayed with our son at home and she was fine with this. I told her around three weeks ago we'd changed out minds about going out of town as I didnt want to be stuck in traffic on our anniversary and I was going to talk to hubby about what he wanted to do instead. We eventually decided to  stay in town but still leave in the morning and spend the day together child free. Hubby works mon - fri  and I work alternating weekends so we dont get a lot of time alone with a toddler. 

I know I told our nanny that the plan was to go have breakfast then do some things we've been wanting to do around town for the day and end the day with dinner. Now I may have just told her that plan once, and only followed up with a time to be here in the morning, but I know I told her at least once that was the plan. She is pregnant and pregnancy brain is real so I probably should have reminded her. 

Heres the issue. She told my husband yesterday (remember anniversary is tomorrow) that she has plans for dinner tomorrow night. So my hubby today said to verify her availability for tomorrow night. So I reiterated the plan  and asked if it was ok. She text me saying that would be fine she would just cancel her dinner plans. Said she told my hubby about them yesterday but it's fine she'll just cancel. 

AITA for not offering to come home earlier so she can keep her dinner plans with family? She said she made them after we told her we weren't going out of town, but like I said I know I told her about our plans weeks ago and this is the first time she's mentioned hers. It wouldn't normally be an issue to just come home early except we have dinner reservations at a restaurant I really love and was excited for that doesn't even open until 5pm."	No A-holes here	0	0

I am not obese but I am chubby/overweight. I know that I am fat, and I am working on not being fat. For what it's worth, multiple close friends and my siblings all insist that I am not, and that I'm average size, but that doesn't matter because I know I am fat. My mother, however, has told me I am overweight multiple times. Today I was down in the dumps because I was thinking about how fat I am and that people look at me and think I'm super fat too. My mom realized I was sad and asked what was wrong, I told her I did not want to talk about it because she'd make comments I didn't want to hear but she pushed really hard, so I said ""I'm just upset because I know I'm really fat and other people look at me and think I'm fat."" Her response was ""you are really fat though."" I got upset and told her ""I just said I know I am overweight and this is why I didn't want to talk about it with you because when I'm super down about it I don't need to hear someone else reiterating that I'm fat."" She then said ""oh sorry I only said that because I thought you asked me if I thought you were fat"" which made me angrier because I never asked her if I was fat I just told her I was sad because I am fat and know that I am, and when I told her this she got angry and kept insisting she only said this because I asked her but I NEVER asked her this.

As said in the title, my mother has offered to pay for all extra expenses like food outside the dorm mess, entertainment, etc. This is in addition to asking her brother, my uncle, to pay for all academic fees for my course.

Some points to consider:

1. My family has been in financial straits for the past two years, and it looks as if we will be coming out of that slump only this year. This has led to my mother incurring some additional debt among her friend circle.
2. I have spent the same amount of time trying to figure out what I want to do. That said, I have been helping her with whatever money making ventures she goes in for. 
3. Retail and service jobs will be few and far between in the city in which my university is located. That said, I am perfectly capable of taking up transcription or data entry jobs.
4. My mother wants me to take my studies seriously enough to come within the top 10% of the course rankings (top 4 in a batch of 40 students).
5. My mother has done the same thing for my brother when he was in university, which he has just graduated from.
6. The course I am attending for is Data Science, which is widely acknowledged as a lucrative and fast-growing field.

bwqfiq	2019-06-04 16:03:43	SirPoliswags	AITA for using a public place with my dog?	"My girlfriend and I moved to a new town 5 months ago and bought a newly constructed home, we celebrated the occasion by getting a new Golden Retriever puppy. There is going to be a garage in our backyard but the builder hadn’t started building it yet since the ground hadn’t thawed. This has left us without a fence or grass as they need to construct the garage and then finish grading our lawn. 

Clearly getting a dog during this time wasn’t ideal but it was something we really wanted to do. When there was still snow, we would take her out into the backyard to do her business but now that the snow is all gone we have stopped doing that as the yard has become a mud filled lake. 

For the last month or so, I have been taking our dog to a public green area about two minutes away from home. It is not the largest space but it is the closest spot with natural grass to our home outside of letting her do her business in other homeowners lawns (which feels wrong). It is also clean and doesn’t require me to bathe her each time we go out. At the end of the green space is a wooden fence and on the other side are some 2 storey homes with their back deck facing the green space. I am typically only there for 5 minutes or less. 

The other day a lady came out onto her deck yelling “Jesus F****** Christ”. I thought she must not have seen me and would be embarrassed knowing someone heard her but soon figured out that her comment was directed at me. She told me there were other places for my dog to use as a washroom. I nicely tried to explain that I currently don’t have grass or a proper yard to use for my dog’s bathroom breaks and that this was the closest public space to me. She responded by telling me there is a perfectly good path with natural grass 2 minutes away and that I should take my dog there as it won’t bug anyone. I tried momentarily to reason with her but eventually stopped responding to her comments. I do kind of see her point of view, I probably wouldn’t like to see dogs using the bathroom all day either. However, from a convenience standpoint, I don’t want to take the extra 4 minutes per bathroom break and then spend extra time washing my dog each time she rolls in the path’s “natural grass” and mud.

Even though I feel justified, this has been bugging me for the last few days and I wanted to see if maybe IATA and if I WIBTA if I kept using this public space?

English is my second language and post is gonna be bit lengtht, sorry in advance. 

Earlier today I went to the store to buy some stuff and I noticed a big panel written on it ""We're hiring, just come as you are and apply, NO RESUME NEEDED only your motivation"". So I ask the cashier about it and she tells me to go to the main ""welcome desk"" at the entrance. After I check out I put my stuff in the car and go to the desk to apply, when I arrive I see 4 employees (all female) doing nothing and all gave me a kinda nasty look like i disturbed them and looked me from feet to head. 

I asked with a big smile if I could apply for the jobs offered and they answered me in a snarky tone ""yeah you need a resumé and cover letter"" i answer ""yeah but the big panel said ""NO RESUME NEEDED, just your motivation"" and they said again snarkily ""yeah they made a mistake just come again with a resume and letter"" and ended the conversation. 

As I am very NON-confrontational I just calmly left the store after saying goodbye. 

Once arrived home I started to boil, having being treated that way and now want to call corporate to complain about how those girls might treat potential applicants and straight up lie to them.

I'm broke as fuck and unemployed and don't wanna be too picky but I don't want to apply to this job anymore as this behavior raised some red flags to me. 

My mom (with whom i live) doesn't think I'm TA for filing a complaint but thinks I'm TA for being too picky and should apply anyway since I'm broke.

bwqakm	2019-06-04 15:52:04	throwawaytosayheyhey	AITA for not wanting to live in a spider infested Nazi basement over the summer?	"Me and my SO are temporarily staying in my hometown which is in another country from where we usually live and study. After having asked around for a place to stay, a friend of a friend offered us their guest room + other facilities in exchange for us paying half the rent. This plan was made and agreed to months in advance. We didn't really have any expectations as to the quality of the flat, and I never asked for specifics regarding the state of the place (my mistake), I simply assumed that the place would be alright since the homeowner seemed nice enough to offer it up and asked for a decent amount of rent money. 

When we arrived, however, the place turned out to be... well, not so pleasant. The hallway and living room was filled with random junk, and our ""bedroom"" turned out to be a cupboard under the stairs. Think Harry Potter, but a bit bigger. The home owner had managed to squeeze in a queen sized double air mattress, but this meant that there was no floor space for any of our stuff as the cupboard also led to the bathroom and one needed to get by the mattress to enter there. Both doors leading to the hallway and bathroom also opened into the room, giving us even less floor space to work with. 

We weren't thrilled by what we saw, but the home owner was super sweet and gave us a warm welcome, seemingly oblivious to our (hopefully) discreet reactions. 

The room had no windows, the door to the hallway could not be properly closed and the fact that it was situated between the hallway and the bathroom meant no privacy whatsoever.  

Keeping up the chirpy atmosphere, the home owner left for a quick run to the shop and me and my SO took this opportunity to check out the entirety of the flat. The whole place reeked of weed and we saw spiders literally everywhere we looked. The hallway, bathroom, living room and our bedroom had spiders of all shapes and colours crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling. In the living room, we were greeted with a wonderful display of old Nazi pins/badges. One can argue that the home owner is simply a history enthusiast who likes collecting relics of the past, but the whole thing just gave us a weird vibe. We never asked, and the homeowner never addressed the pins either, so it remains a mystery. 

We stayed for one night, barely getting an hour of sleep each because of spider paranoia and the uncomfortable mattress, and moved out the next day when the owner was away. I made sure to message them saying we had gotten another offer for a room closer to my work which was too good to pass up. 

I still feel bad for leaving in such a hurry and for thinking that the flat wasn't ""good enough"", especially since the homeowner was being so kind and welcoming to us. My dad is telling me that I'm just being too fussy and that the flat was a perfectly fine place to stay over the summer. I'm starting to doubt our decision to move out. AITA here?

bwqafg	2019-06-04 15:51:41		AITA for wanting to get a house fogged	My roommate and his gf (of two weeks) decided to get a cat together after we had just moved in. I had asked him if we can wait on not having a cat because My gf and I are just coming into the house and wanna get settled first before some creature I’ll probably have to help out with comes in. He says sure but of course the girlfriends eggs him on to get a cat. After I bond really well with the cat and he gets jealous because it likes me more than him. But that’s because his gf decided to bring her cat to the house after they were told that this cat doesn’t like other animals and is only social with humans. So they decide well we can just have them flip between being outdoor and indoor cat. I proceed to tell them that that’s a terrible idea because the cats will  have a higher risk of bringing in fleas or ticks. Well sure enough fleas get brought in the house and a month later are still in the house. The cat has ran away because he got mad and put it outside on a rainy day and it never came back. His gf is gone and a new gf is in the house. When I brought up my issue with the fleas he had told me they’re just bugs and to get over it. Now that I am bringing in foggers he is protesting that the foggers will ruin his comics in his comic room.	Not the A-hole	1	0

bwq71u	2019-06-04 15:43:34		AITA for yelling at my fiance for making me watch an animated animal death after I told him I don't want to?	"Long title, hear me out.

My fiance and I love video games, we play video games together all the time. He played that Minecraft ""video game"" that was on Netflix. I watched him play it here and there, it doesn't really interest me because I hate the pixel graphic style, but the plot line was cool. An important note, I am EXTREMELY sensitive to animals getting hurt/lost or dying, no matter what kind, animated or not. I know it's childish but after volunteering with a dog rescue organization and fostering severely abused animals, it's made me very sensitive to this type of stuff.

This next part is going to have spoilers

\*\*SPOILERS\*\*

I didn't watch my fiance play the whole game so basically kids go to a sculpture(?) making competition, then the main girl, her pig and her friends find some enemies or something they have to fight. The end of an episode is the main girl and her pet pig fight this huge monster to get something they need (I think) and basically the pet pig falls out of the sky after fighting this monster (please help me remember because I can't find the synopsis) and dies. It doesn't die immediately, it's in visible pain and the girl comes over to comfort the pig, then it dies and turns into meat.

\*\*END OF SPOILERS\*\*

I was FURIOUS with him when this happened. I knew something bad was going to happen to the pig, and I begged him to stop playing and play later when I wasn't home. He told me it was fine, just to watch it'll be cool. He reassured me he read ahead and nothing happened to the pig. Well the fucking pig dies and here I am, crying and hyperventilating in the bed because I am so upset. I ended up yelling at him for a few minutes about why he shouldn't have made me watch it, i'm going to be so upset for a few days, etc. He tells me i'm being over dramatic and a dick for yelling at him, and to get over it, it's an animated pig, not real pig. He knows that I get upset when this happens, he's shot a horse before on Red Dead Redemption 2 without warning me and I yelled at him to not do that. So, AITA for getting upset?

bwq5iz	2019-06-04 15:39:58	claritone	WIBTA for refusing to help my cousin w her English?	"So (not so) quick context: I’m half Japanese, but I was raised in an English speaking city. I know how to speak and understand Japanese enough to get by, but I can’t read/write. My cousin (19F) grew up in Japanese suburbia and only knows English from what she’s been taught at her school, therefore it’s v standard not super conversational English. because of that, I feel v much like a foreigner around her and my family, being limited in my japanese. I (16F) am a depressed high school dropout trying to get my life back together. basically I have a good chunk of spare time on my hands as well as my own shit to deal w. 


Okay so! My cousin is going to Cambodia and Nepal this summer for some volunteer work, and all the other volunteers aren’t Japanese. so she wants cram in as much English learning as she can before going. she texted me asking me if she could call me to work on her English. I said yes, and then after I had replied, my mom told me that my cousin had texted her because I was taking too long to reply. My cousin told my mom that she wanted to talk to me /once a week/ for an hour until she left for her trip to work on her English. conveniently she did not mention this until I agreed to call her this week. 

so I explained to her as best as I could without sounding bitchy, which idk if I did well, that while I would gladly answer some question or help w the basics, I’m not a language tutor and I can’t really translate English to Japanese that well. I told her that if she wanted to hear how English is casually spoken, she’d be better off w tv shows/movies and suggested a couple language learning apps. to which she just replied with a straight up “no” without an explanation why. 

honestly her English isn’t bad, it’s fine, it’s v basic as can be expected but it’s still perfectly understandable. I think for it to come more naturally to her it’d be best to learn from being among people who speak it and gradually pick things up from there. I’ll admit it also kind of pissed me off that she’d just assumed that I’d give up that time off my summer just like that. we’ve also never been that close, mainly because of the language barrier and the cultural difference, which makes this more awkward tell her no. but maybe I’m just making excuses.


anyway, I’ve agreed to one call for now to see how it goes, but wibta to refuse to be her English tutor once a week just because it feels somewhat pointless to me?

bwq5af	2019-06-04 15:39:20	gonnatossthisoneaway	WIBTA If I go behind my parent's backs to family for money	"Parents have been fully retired since 2009 although my dad retired earlier. They have always been conservative and frugal with money. Small 2500 square foot home that has been paid off for two decades and two newish cars (2016) that are owned outright. Growing up, it seemed like my dad footed the bill for most things although i'm unclear on what went on behind the curtain between them.

&#x200B;

The financial advisor they've been with for the last 25 years is incredibly conservative and their motto is that ""Everyone makes money when the market does well, we pride ourselves on losing LESS than what everyone else loses when the market does bad"". Following that logic, they've had an average return of 7% a year since they started investing and they still haven't fully recovered since the 2008 crash where they lost close to 30% of the portfolio value.

&#x200B;

My dad has a pension of about 5000 a month. At their peak, they had combined assets of roughly 1.8 million not including the house. The division of assets was nearly equal with my dad having slightly more than my mom. Over the past 10 years, his share of the investments has been going down while my moms has gone up and now the division is mom: \~1 million, dad: \~500k for a total of 1.5 mill. The only change that I could see was that 6 years ago my mom shifted one of her investment funds to an Ameritas variable annuity life insurance policy that had a single premium of 300k with a 500 per month payout and is valued at 604k as of 5/31. So my dad is losing money while my mom is gaining money.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, my mom always blames my sister for the reason that my dad's balances have been diminishing. She claims that my sister is always asking my dad for money and he can't say no, and if the trend continues, that he will outlive his retirement investments.

&#x200B;

My dad's extended family is incredibly wealthy. Forbes billionaire list wealthy. His two brothers and him struck out on their own and each made their own accomplishments. They didn't take part in the family industries. My grandfather, now deceased, established a family trust in his will that is managed by his sister (my great aunt). The trust is to be accessible for anyone in the family who may need it.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking of contacting my great aunt and explaining the situation to them to see if the trust can help. I know of only one other family member that has used resources in the trust when in dire need. Additionally, I know for a fact that my dad would be very upset if I did this without consulting him but I know that he would never ask for help of his own accord because thats just not who he is. I am not in a position to support him myself but I do plan on doing so when I can.

bwq4pw	2019-06-04 15:37:55		AITA for getting annoyed at the delivery guy for being early?	"So, I ordered sushi with home delivery. They said I would receive it in 35 mins but 20 mins after it, I got a message where they apologized and said it will be 45-50 mins instead due to their delivery guy running late. 

I was fine with it and decided to shower before it. It took me like 15 mins to shower and then I heard the sound of my door bell and was like what the fuck. He arrived on 35 mins, instead of 45-50 mins. 

I wasn’t ready at all. I have a dog who loves greeting people at door so I usually try to keep him inside the kitchen, as not everyone love dogs. Since I thought I had more time, I haven’t put up a gate between kitchen and hallway. 

I was also naked and newly showered so I just threw a morning robe on and rushed to the door. I tried to make my dog go away but he won’t listen to me and kept running around like crazy as the delivery guy kept pressing on the door bell. 

Finally my dog sat down like I told him to. I thought it was safe to open the door. But as soon as I opened, my dog rushed out and greeted the delivery guy (just running around, wagging his tail). It was obviously the delivery guy didn’t like dogs at all as he immediately backed away and tried to get away from him. I quickly caught my dog and brought him in the apartment. 

Then the delivery guy started to yell at me for letting him wait for such a long time and he also said it wasn’t okay at all to release my dog on him like that. I told him I was sorry but it was kind of his fault as he came earlier than said and kept pressing the door bell like crazy and I didn’t have time to put up a gate between hallway and kitchen.

My grandfather passed away about a month ago. The whole process was really hard, I (19m) used to be really close with him when I first came from Korea to Canada. He would take me out and try to teach me english and take me to the movies in hopes I would be able to catch on to western culture and language. We used to have long talks about when he was in the Korean army during the Korean war. 

This was all about 10 years ago, we stopped seeing him when his health deteriorated, I couldn't bring myself to see him. They told me he was no longer able to comprehend basic conversations, and would just ramble and ramble about his turmoil during his time in deployment during the war. No matter how many times my mom and grandma tried to force me to go, the closest I would get was to the doors of his care home before I would run back to the car.

As the years passed, my family stopped asking me and I never bothered to try and visit him. 

fast forward to the present, I get a call from my mom that my grandfather was dying. Apparently, his carer didn't clean his diapers and he got a really bad infection. He couldn't recover, so he was just lying on his death bed awaiting the almighty. 

I couldn't even recognize him, he was so small and fragile. They had to shake him to wake up, his eyes lit up when he saw me and instantly he started to cry. I couldn't believe I made myself stay away from him for so long, he talked to me about how he wished he could have helped me more growing up, and told me not to waste my life away running away, you only have one. In his will he gave me most of his savings, and his car that we used to take during our adventures.

We stayed until he passed. At the funeral, people I haven't seen in years were there. This was my first funeral ever, I was going to be standing by his casket during the funeral and giving a speech. I overheard people saying in Korean (Most people don't realize I speak Korean because my english is very good) that I didn't deserve to cry or be apart of his funeral. 

During my speech I was tearing up and I literally heard someone say that I was crying crocodile tears, I thought of how my grandfather told me not to run and I stayed and finished my speech.

After the funeral I yelled at everyone who were talking behind my back in perfect korean, all of them were laughing at me and told me that I should be glad I was getting most of his savings and his car. There was this one and only white lady who was there who is your perfect definition of a karen, who yelled at me for making a scene at his funeral. She called me an asshole and to just sit and shut the fuck up because we were all in grief, I dont even think she knew my grandfather, but she was just there because it was open doors to anyone, she gave a speech as well.

I guess its fair that people don't think I deserve to be sad, but at the same time hes my grandfather, I will always love him. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

She would only hang out with me at school and a nearby place for food which we went to regularly and we texted quite often however she would always decline hanging out anywhere else. I guess the meant I was friend zoned but that's cool. I have scoliosis, it's usually not visible unless I bend over pretty far which is what I was doing to grab something from my seat. She was behind me and started taking pictures of me and started showing everyone and laughing. Kinda mean but that's OK too I can take a joke. Soon after she started acting a bit different, she would always do this thing where if I needed to bend over or something she will position herself behind me so she can try to see my back and she will start making grossed out faces or trying to get others to see what she's seeing. We usually take turns paying for our meals at the local restaurant we always go to but all of the sudden she started not remembering who paid last and refused to pay so I paid the next 3 times in a row. After that last thing I slowly just started cutting her off by not really replying to her messages, not sitting with her in class and declining her invites to go out to eat. I think she may have sensed something was wrong and was showering me with good attention and even was suggesting places to hang out other than the restaurant which I thought was weird because she never wanted to hang out before. I thought hmm.. Maybe this is her way of saying sorry. However the sly jokes continued and I started hearing from other people that she constantly talks about me negatively like always joking on me. I decided to fully cut her off 100%. The next few months up until now have been pretty odd with her. If she's alone she will give me a death stare like she wants to stab me death. If she's with friends she will say something to get them all to look at me and start laughing or one time one of her friends who I'm also friends with hugged me like she was greeting me but she was actually just rubbing my back trying to feel my scoliosis. At random times she yells stuff at me from a distance  like ""oh my God you don't talk to me anymore!"" or just sits there awkwardly staring at me in silence or she would overhear a conversation I'm having with someone else and she will mumble something negative about what I said under her breath. I usually just ignore her. I prefer not to say anything at all to her because all she seems to do is spread stuff around and I don't want her to twist what I said when she decides to tell others.

bwq1m9	2019-06-04 15:30:44	nimboyaya	WIBTA if I ask my roommate to pay to cancel my airline tickets.	"So about a month ago I asked my roommate if she would watch my dogs (2 mixed lab breeds 2 and 4yrs) while I go on vacation for two weeks, she agreed and I offered to pay her because I felt it was fair. I just can't afford to put the dogs in the kennels that are often more expensive than hotels. A few days later there was a death in the family and I had to leave for just two days and again she was kind enough to watch the dogs. 

This is where it all goes south. This morning while I'm six hours drive from home I wake up to a text along the lines of ""the dogs were barking all night and shit in the house if you don't clean this by the time I get home I'm not watching your dogs."" 

For a little context I have literally never had the dog she said pooped inside have an accident nor have they ever barked at night. Obviously I wasn't there but I feel this is way out of the ordinary and wouldn't have happened if I were at home. 

I don't feel as if I should have to rush home from a funeral to clean up shit that shouldn't have happened. Additionally I feel that if I have to cancel my trip to stay with my dogs that she should pay to cancel it as I only booked it because she agreed to watch them for me, and be paid for it. (To clarify the funeral has happened and I was planning on heading home later today, after spending some more time here. However even if I left now I would not get home before she is off work) 

TLDR: dog shit inside, roommate is backing out of agreement to watch dog, I may have to cancel trip beacuse of this 

Sorry if formatings fucked, I'm a mobile user.

EDIT: She has watched one of the two dogs before without issue. The one that shit inside is the new one, so as many posted and I had not considered separation anxiety is a possibility.

EDIT2: To clarify I had asked if she would be willing to dog sit before I booked the trip as I wouldn't have booked it if I could not find someone to watch the dogs.

FINAL EDIT: A huge thanks to everyone that commented, I am definitely not going to ask her to pay anything. Going forward I am not going to ask her to watch the dogs again. Thanks again."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwq17d	2019-06-04 15:29:46		AITA For not wanting my dad to go to the same therapist as me?	"My (19f) dad asked me who I went to see for therapy. Then he told me about how he could never find a therapist to accept his previous insurance, but he just got a new one so hopefully they’d be willing to take it. He asked if she’d be willing to take him on as a client or at least refer him to someone. I said “probably” and then I pulled up the website with her info on it, and her picture was right there. She’s a very pretty woman and I knew that he knew because he was suddenly enthusiastic about seeing her. 

My dad (41) divorced my stepmom (48) January last year and already had a much younger girlfriend (25) before it was even finalized. He also cheated on my mom when they were together. So, knowing about his unwillingness to be lonely and the quick attachments he makes to women, I could see him developing “feelings” for my therapist while she helps him. I don’t even know if therapists are allowed to see family members involved in familial conflict. Not to mention that my sister who hasn’t spoken to him in a year goes to the same therapist, though she’s moving in a few months.

I guess most of my hesitance stems from him being *really* quick to develop feelings for women who treat him nicely. He proposed to my mother after dating for a month, he proposed to my stepmom after knowing her for 2 weeks (less than a year after his first divorce), and he was dating his current girlfriend as soon as him and my stepmother took a break, which was 4 months before the divorce. Not to mention they worked together. He was also quick to say that the reason for the divorce was my stepmom cheating on him, which was odd considering when the supposed “cheating” happened (a coworker joked about going on a date), he immediately suggested divorce, and all throughout their marriage she was the only one trying to fix it.

I haven’t told him I don’t want him to, because we just spoke about it, but I want to bring it up to my therapist in my next session and make sure that she’s only referring him and not taking him on. I trust and respect her judgement, so I doubt she will take him, but the possibility makes me uncomfortable. I feel like an ass because I do want him to get help, but just not from her. If it happens, I’ll suck it up, but it’d be great if it didn’t. Not to mention that as soon as I saw the look he made, I mentioned that she’s married to her assistant.

I can't stop feeling other people's pain and I don't feel bad about that at all. I also suffer from crippling anxiety (to a morbid degree) and am constantly over-loving the people I love out of fear that any of them could be taken from me at any moment.

I (25F) will sometimes visit my parents and stay at their house (I still have a bedroom there). I wanted to extend my weekend with them by a day so I opted to stay another night and just go to work from their house without going home. Now, when my mom got home from her job I was playing with the dog and doing some cleaning in their kitchen. She was on the phone from the second she walked in the door (5:30ish) until well after I was trying to sleep (11 pm).

My uncle (her brother) killed himself a few years ago. My entire family took it very hard, and it opened cans of worms that led to relationships being strained (there are about 34 of us total on that side of the family \[aunts/uncles/cousins\]. There was a memorial hosted by his late wife recently, and my mother and aunt were having a detailed conversation about how offended, essentially, they were by the following:

1. She couldn't believe his widowed wife had removed all proof he even existed from his home (which is not only her view of the house, but he killed himself IN THAT HOUSE, I'm sure the memories are overwhelming for his family to be there every day)
2. His 22 yo son showed up to the memorial looking like he rolled out of bed.
3. His three other children showed no  interest in being there.

These were the three main points I took from the bit of the conversation that happened after it changed to speakerphone (about the last 30 minutes), but it's not the first time I've heard my mom or either of her sisters on the phone speaking poorly of my uncle's wife. It disgusted me on multiple levels, and expressed to my dad that overhearing it made me uncomfortable and I didn't even want to stay over anymore and that I'd just drive home, all of the dramatic petty reactions. Truly though I'm just so bothered by my mom and aunts trying to dictate how this family chooses to mourn. SLIGHTLY MORE BACKSTORY - My father came down with cancer earlier in my life. My mother almost lost her partner to an illness 20 years ago, and still talks about how scary that was for her all the time. I understand they lost their brother, but I'm so distraught and bothered that they speak so poorly about people who have to navigate something that I wouldn't wish on anyone.

I know families are gossipy, especially big ones. It's been a major part of my entire life, but I'm just appalled by the treatment my widowed aunt is receiving, and the judgement my cousins are facing. WIBTA For telling my mom to give my aunt and cousins a fucking break?

&#x200B;

Edited to include a minor detail: my late uncle's wife has received INSANE passive aggression, rude comments, and an icy cold shoulder from my family since my uncle took his life. I can't speak on whether she cares or not, but my cousin (who was also close to my uncle/not his kid) talk often about how poorly she's treated."	Asshole	0	0
bwq0qv	2019-06-04 15:28:39	amithewrong	AITA for trying to kiss a girl who I really thought liked me?	"Hello everyone, I was just thrown completely for a loop last night and maybe I really fucked up. I think I'm a decent person and while I'm certainly not a cassanova, I'm also definitely not an in-cel or ""nice"" guy and I've dated a few girls here and there. I'm now 19. 

I am one of a very small handful of people that stayed behind in my college town to take summer classes. All my friends have left so I found a group of people who are also here and all of them seemed cool enough so I've pretty much been hanging out with them every night. I don't drink or smoke out so almost always by the time things wrap up it's usually me and this girl Claire as the last sober/non obnoxious ones since she doesn't do any substance either.  Claire is knockout gorgeous but also sort of a silly tomboy type girl. She's very easy to talk to and is one of the funniest and wittiest people I've ever met. I honest to god thought she was too good for me but I really enjoyed her company. I started to think maybe something was up last Friday when the ""house"" was essentially a hot box and we took a walk in the park down the street and she held my hand and told me how comfortable she was with me. I was still to shy to do anything but it was an awesome moment. 

Last night she and I were in the basement of the house watching a movie and first she hooked her leg over mine and then insisted I take my socks off so we could compare shoe sizes. We then got in like a ""foot wrestling"" match and we were both laughing hysterically. That went on for a while and she sort of laid next to me on the couch. She has a slight lisp so it cracks me up how she says ""boobs"" so she kept saying that word to get me to laugh. Then she said something along the lines of ""if you like how I say it so much, show me your boobs and I'll show you mine."" Before I could even get my shirt up she had her tank top off and braless and I was like holy shit she's fucking naked. 

So at that moment I decided to make a move I went into kiss her but as I was trying to put my hand around her back I landed square on her naked boob. She freaked out. I mean it went from a fun playful evening to her being absolutely furious with me in a matter of seconds. I told her I was really sorry that wasn't what I wanted to happen and she replied with ""I don't even see how that's possible!"" She gathered up her clothes and sort of threw on  sweat shirt and stormed upstairs. I can't get her on text or VM so I think she blocked me. 

i'm so sad because I honestly would have never even tried anything if I thought this would happen because I just loved hanging out with her. I feel like such an idiot for even trying to kiss her much less touching her. I feel awful but was I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwpzyj	2019-06-04 15:26:49		AITA lying, socially unaware flatmate	"I moved into this new place just 5 weeks ago(2 bedroom), thinking that I had finally found a person I could trust. I even told him a bit about the issues I had in old places with there not being hot water or something and he said that ""I think if the landlord doesn't fulfil their duty to provide the utilities, then the tenant shouldn't have to pay rent"". you'll see why this is ironic at the end.

&#x200B;

While we did get along amazingly, I did notice that he had lied about the fact that the room came with a dresser when I came to view it but  I let it slide. 2. The fridge didn't get cold. But I was only told a half truth(that the fridge temp fluctuated) after I had paid the deposit, rent and moved in. AND NOT TO MENTION THAT SMART FRIDGES BEEP WHEN THE TEMP DROPS SO DURING NIGHT EARLY MORNING OF COURSE I WOULD HAVE TO WAKE UP AND TURN IT OFF SEVERAL TIMES. He didn't mention the prospect of buying a new now but I ASSUMEd he'd just buy a new one soon. I let this go on for 3 WEEKS w/o fridge, only asking him a total of 2 times very politely about the status of the fridge, not wanting to seem like I was nagging. Of course I was pissed, not only because of the sheer inconvenience but the fact that he would never update me, I had to ask HIM and when I did he would have an attitude about it or make the excuse that he is waiting for his friend to move so he could get his friend's old fridge for free. Despite all this, I kept it together and we maintained a good relationship. 3 week mark arrives and I go ""is the fridge coming or not"" in a slightly pissed off voice, he continues with a 3 minute bullshit excuse. I reply with ""but it's like going 3 weeks without a fridge"" in the same tone. I say ""okay"" and go to my room to sleep.Mind you he slams the door after like a self-important idiot. It was at this point that he began to disgust me. another 2-3 weeks have passed and we pretty much just say 'hello"" and 'goodbye' to each other which is a draaastic change from how much we used to talk in the beginning. Of course I am also angry that all he could muster up was a lame and unemphatic ""sorry"" but not financial compensation for example. 

&#x200B;

As he bought and owns all the furniture inside it was his responsibility to replace it. From his point of view, I understand wanting to wait for your friend to get a free fridge, but the LEAST you could do is keep me updated about when it is coming, apologise profusely and try to not act like a fucking cunt (he does other not-appropriate-for-shared-living-space shit).

&#x200B;

I mean things are cordial, im moving out in 2 weeks ofc, there has been no fight but im so fucking pissed/uncomfortable. I know im not the asshole but I feel like it for making the statement(body lang) that I dislike him by suddenly not engaging in conversation (he hasn't initiated any) and clearly avoiding him."

bwpy3s	2019-06-04 15:22:30	sickcunttrashaccount	WIBTA if I ditched the workshop/self-help session that my mom signed me up for	"For the past two years or so, my mom has been obsessed with self improvement. Everytime I hang with her, she is talking about a club she has joined or a workshop that she went to recently. Most recently, the one she has been sticking with is called Landmark. 



Now, if you look up ""landmark organization"", one of the first things that comes up is about how the organization may or may not be a cult. My mom came back from an intensive weekend-long workshop, and was telling me about how ""what they taught her completely changed her view of the world"", and that she was no longer depressed. She has suffered from depression her whole life, so her saying made me highly skeptical of both the organization and of her ability to self-assess. 



She told me that she strongly wanted to go to this thing. I expressed that I really didn't want to, and that I was skeptical of it all. She said ""Anon, I really just need you to trust me on this, please do it for me"". To me, this felt a bit manipulative, but I decided fine, it's just one weekend out of my summer, I'll humor her. 



Now, a couple months after signing up for it, my friends invite me to go with them to Cape Cod on the same weekend. I asked if they could do any other weekend, but this was the only one that worked for all of them. 



I am not worried about wasting my moms money which she used to sign me up, because she has expressed to me many times that it is not an issue, she is well off. Of course, I'd much rather go to Cape Cod, and both my friends and my other parent have told me that this is what I should do. But I know doing so will hurt my mom, and might weaken our relationship for a while. I honestly have no clue what to do."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwpxut	2019-06-04 15:21:57	silent_dooker	AITA for not defending the honor of a fellow pooper?	"Dear friends:

About a month ago, I was using the handicap stall at work, one of my favorite workplace activities. Things were proceeding normally, when I hear a knock on the stall door.  ""Are you almost done in there?"" Clearly the man has a situation to deal with, and I do my best to accommodate, responding: ""I'll just be a moment."" and proceed with my normal sanitation routine. (I'll spare you all the details, but I'm sure you get the idea.) This isn't enough for our friend, who then begins a tirade: ""You shouldn't be using the handicap stall. Do you want me to contact your manager? You know you can get fined $250 for using a handicapped stall without being handicapped? I will contact HR."" This is obviously a bit off-putting, and I respond with ""Give it a rest buddy, I'll be out in one moment."" I finish washing my hands, and pop the stall door, give the guy a big smile. ""She's all yours bud."" and proceed out of the restroom.

&#x200B;

I return to my desk, and proceed to do a quick google. I first check if there is actually any legislation/fine associated with using a handicapped stall. There isn't. The only actual legislation revolves around size/dimensions/accessibility. I then google ""handicap stall etiquette"" - the internet's general consensus is that using a handicap stall is ok, especially if other stalls are occupied, and no handicapped people are actively waiting to use it. I'm pretty sure I'm in the clear, I have a laugh about it, tell the story to a few close friends, and go on with my life.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I'm once again, as is my prerogative, getting paid to poo. This time I'm using the regular stall - I've avoided the handicapped stall for the most part since ""The stall Nazi"" incident. Some unfortunate soul did not get the memo, as I hear a knock at the stall door next to my own. ""Are you almost done in there?"" ""There sure are a lot of handicapped people around here, I should start taking pictures and sending them to HR."" I stifle a laugh, and maintain my silence. I immediately text my girl - ""The stall Nazi strikes again!"" and relay the story to her.

She calls me out for not defending the rights of the downtrodden, and allowing this guy to continue his reign of terror.

My stance is that:

1. I believe the sanctity and silence of a men's restroom should be maintained at all times, with the exception of fart and plopping noises.
2. I don't want to get involved with this guy, he's clearly a spaz.
3. I DEFINITELY don't want to get caught up in some HR incident, it's always been my policy to avoid interaction with HR, for reasons that should be totally obvious to anyone who has spent any time at all working in corporate America.

My mom is moving but she's is recently widowed with a 3 year old so packing is hard when she has to simultaneously watch the kid. I'm up here helping her but even with 2 of us, with have a basically a week and a half to pack the entire house and we can't work at the same time because one of us has to watch the kid. A few weeks ago when my friend visited, they mentioned that they might possibly be able to come up and visit again (they aren't working right now and have very little plans, their words). My mom asked if I could ask my friend to come up and help watch the kid while we pack and she'd pay all her gas and get her a massage. 

I didn't think that was a very fair trade off but I told my friend anyway and made it very clear what my opinions on it are (that it isn't very fair, they'd basically be an unpaid babysitter, you're allowed to say no, it's a long drive, etc) and let them decide. A few days later I texted them to get a for sure answer and asked that ""they're probably not coming, right?"" Just because I knew the situation and doubted they would want to. They said they would though and that they'd be here in a day or two. 

After they agreed though they were kind of weird about it but I figured that they're an adult, they'd tell me if they really weren't ok with it. So I told my mom they were coming and she was really relieved. Cut to today, the day they were supposed to come. They texted me about 20 minutes ago that they aren't coming anymore and basically listed everything I had mentioned previous as the reasoning. (Not being comfortable being an unpaid babysitter, worried about the drive, etc). I told them that I understand and that those are completely valid feelings but that I wish they would have told me sooner, basically just not the day they was supposed to be coming. I tried to always make it clear that they could say no and not to feel like they have to come. But if they could've told me that first time I asked them, or when I texted them, or literally anytime before the morning they were supposed to leave then I wouldn't have had to get my mom's hopes up because even originally when she asked me that, I told her it was a long shot.

I'm not mad at them for feeling that way because I whole heartedly understand how they feel and even mentioned that that's how I thought it'd be multiple times. I'm mad because they chose to inform me the day they was supposed to be coming instead of the multiple times I tried to give them the opportunity to say no. But then again, them coming is completely a favor in the first place and I'm wondering if I'm an asshole for being mad that they backed out of something that would have been a favor at the last minute."		1	0

"Today i went to get my car, when i got to the parking lot i realized that someone crashed my old car really badly (not just a bump).So there was a little paper with a license plate number and a phone number on it. I called the number, and it turns out it was left by a delivery guy who has seen what happened. He told me that he went after the car that crashed my car, but they didnt care to stop or anything, so he just wrote down the license plate number and the type of the car.

So i went to the police station to make a report, and it was all really quick, the officer was in a hurry, so she made the whole report in like 5-10 minutes, i didnt even have time to think when i left my car there etc.

So then she asked me if i parked correctly, and i said yes altough it wasnt technically true. I park my car next to my dormitory, and in work days there are cars everywhere so its really hard, to get a stop if you left the parking lot.Long story short, the lot is kind of a circle and there are a few spaces in the middle, but everyday people park in middle as fully as it is possible, so i also like to park just like that, but i always check if the cars next to me can leave their spots ( my car is also really small), and when i left my car i was sure that there is enough space for everyone.

So technically i kind of was parking by the rules but im not sure 100%, because in the middle there are just a few lines, and i parked next to the last one, and i am not sure if that is allowed or you should park only between the lines, its hard to tell, its a closed area next to my uni, but i know the rules are the same as if it would be anywhere else.

So when the officer asked if i parked by the rules, i said yes, meanwhile i know it might be not true, and she also said after that perjury is a felony and if i parked in the wrong place i get a fine as well.

But i am so mad that someone just crashed my car and then just left eventhough i could park in an other spot.

EDIT: here is a picture of the parking lot and how i parked [https://i.imgur.com/V87MJ48.png](https://i.imgur.com/V87MJ48.png)

He's a smoker and occasionally he'd smoke in the truck after work on the way home. One day the company owner tells everyone that he doesn't want us smoking in the trucks because he can smell it and doesn't like it. My coworker stop smoking in the truck for a while, but eventually he started again.

Usually, I'm the kind of guy that minds my own business. I never see anything, and I never speak out. However, one day it was just me and the boss and he smelled smoke in the truck. He knows I don't smoke and he directly asks me if my coworker ever smokes in the truck. Me, torn on not wanting to lie and not wanting to rat out my coworker, said ""Yea, a little bit."" He responds by saying ""That's more than a little bit."" (He was referring to the strong smell)

Later that day, I told my coworker that the boss knows he has been smoking in the truck. He was confused and asked how did he know? I told him that he smelled the smoke in the truck and asked me if he's been smoking in the truck. My coworker was quite mad that I ""snitched"" on him. I was confused and asked what was I supposed to do? He replied by saying I was supposed to claim ignorance, to the very end, no matter what.

Mind you, there are only 4 workers at this site at this time, and we are partnered up. We had one truck, and the other 2 guys had their own truck. The boss knows it's only been us 2 in this truck, he knows my cowoker is a smoker, and he knows I don't smoke. The boss fucking knew he's been smoking in the truck before even asking me. If I had said anything else other than the truth, I would be lying to the boss's face, and he'd know it.

My coworker wasn't listening to this logic and still felt like I wronged him by ""snitching"" on him. At the time, I felt bad about having to tell on him, but looking back I see I didn't do anything wrong."	Not the A-hole	1	0

"I’m just a little bit bewildered by a situation with a friend of mine. We have been friends over the past few years, and grew close over a shared experience we have had which was quite traumatic and sad, so to me she was a dear friend. 

We originally know each other from living in a similar area and being in the same social group and became closer together as she opened up about experiences on Instagram, which I identified with and we ended up being close.
Her online following has now grown and she has a few thousand followers, and constantly talks about her account and sees it as a huge deal. She often told me how stressed and busy it made her, and she did kind of start to be distant from me and my other friends in favour of ‘bloggers’ to which I didn’t really understand as I don’t spend much time on instagram or care that much about likes and followers, but I’ve always been supportive of her account, followed her, liked things and commented when she’s needed a bit of a boost when promoting a brand. 

She always talked about how you should always be there for friends, and talks about having good values and being a good person etc. on her social media, but recently she became extremely bad at replying and actually being there when I needed her. She’d half make plans with me and then never reply back when I said that I can do that time/date etc and has been increasingly absent and a bit of a crappy friend. 

I bumped into her recently and I was a bit off with her, as to me she was no longer the good friend I used to know. 

She then messaged me to say sorry if she hurt my feelings, and she could tell I was being off with her , and she knows she hasn’t made effort with me recently. This has been brewing in me for about 6 months, so I just said that it’s pretty shitty to make plans and then be uncontactable and not interested in seeing me. She then said that because of her Instagram account, she is so busy that shes not ‘seeing people’ anymore- so she isnt meeting with actual friends anymore because her Instagram account is taking up all her time.  I kind of went in on her a little bit, saying that I’m a real person and meant to be a good friend that she’s being horrible to, and shes putting Instagram followers over our friendship, to which she had no other reply than ‘We all have different opinions, good luck for the future ‘.  

She’s 30 years old and I find this so odd and such arsehole behaviour! Am I the asshole? Or is she?

Edit: for info, the instagram account is not her main job. She has said before it brings her a bit of extra cash and some freebies. I get that everyone has different interests, but no friend has ever dropped me for a side project before!

Edit: for info, people have been asking how many followers she has. Its around 4k.

Edit: also, people have accused me of pushing my friend and saying i’m unsupportive, which is not the case. Ive always been there to support her whilst she had this page and engaged with her when shes said she’s lacking interest on a particular post, I always comment , like, give advice, take photos etc. And her instagram page is what brought us together in the first place"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Last week, I handed in my notice and was a bit shocked at how it was received. The MD was extremely nice about it, saying he was sad to see me go, wishing me the best of luck etc, but my manager barely said anything. He said thanks, and ignored me and started typing. When I tried to discuss it, he ignored me, then left for the weekend, walking right past me without a word. I then received several very rude and demanding emails about needing things to be done ASAP (all at about 4.30pm on Friday). I arranged for these things to be done, but some required confirmation from him which he ignored.

Since then he has continued to be extremely petty, walking past my desk and greeting everyone there by name and excluding me, refusing to speak to me except via email, admonishing me for being 10 mins late due to a crash causing traffic (which made everyone late but only I was reprimanded), and I have just found out that he lied about all the ‘urgent’ things I had to stay late to do on Friday. In addition to this, two of my colleagues are now treating me like a pariah since they had a meeting with him this morning, although the rest of the team are fantastic as ever. I have also been removed from the reports and emails I need, so I can't do my job, which I only found out when I called an external supplier wanting to know why I hadn't received a confirmation from them. It was upsetting and humiliating.

I gave 3 months’ notice as per my contract, and I have drawn up SOPs and training manuals for whoever replaces me but I feel like I’ve done something horrible to him because of how I’m being treated. My mother said it’s probably because I didn’t tell them I had begun to play outside the organisation, but I feel like that’s normal. I didn’t even accept the other position until after I had handed in my notice, as I wanted to give them a chance to perhaps counter, but instead I’ve been subjected to a lot of pettiness. AMITA?"

bwpq83	2019-06-04 15:03:11	DrMrPootytang	AITA for getting annoyed my GF was eating off the plate as I was trying to grill?	"Last night I finished a softball game and texted my GF to see if she'd like to come over and I'd make us food.  We were in a bit of a tiff the night before so I was hoping to have a nice chill night to get back to normal.  She says yes so I walk to the butcher, get the goods, and meet her back at my place.  I turn the grill on to warm up and go upstairs to where she's laying in my bed.  Off the bat she makes a few jokes about how ugly our new team shirt is (it's ugly). I head back down to cook while she stays in bed and when I'm halfway down she says, ""Wait can you help me with something?""  I come back up and she points to an article of clothing next to the bed so I just chuckle, say ""Yeah right"", and go back down - half annoyed but also half in the playful way from the jokes about how bad I looked in the ugly shirt.  Mind you, the grill is on MAX downstairs this whole time.  Later she said it was her shorts and my roommate was home (on that floor) so she couldn't get out of bed for them.  Guess ITA for that?

&#x200B;

So, annoyance from that plus the night before is building up for us both.  As I throw everything on the grill she tells me she's starving and asks if I have snacks.  I say not really but the food shouldn't take long.  I turn the burner up on some stuff I think she'll like most so I can get it off the grill for her.  I put a sausage on a plate on the wing of the grill and she eats it pretty quickly and shares some.  Then, as everything else finishes up I have to start loading that plate up.  I'm piling 2+lbs of chicken & sausage on and as I'm doing that she's using utensils to eat it.  Not the apocalypse but it made things more difficult.

&#x200B;

I admit, as this was happening I was getting frustrated.  I tried not to snap but she swears I did.  I told her pretty plainly, ""Hey I need to use this plate"" to which she starts going off, half laughing, along the lines of ""OMG calm down.  I'm not hurting anything.  How am I hindering you at all?"" which of course just irked me more.  If I'm grilling for you and I'm telling you that you're making things more difficult, why can't you just be like ""Oh my bad, I'll wait two minutes for you to finish.""

&#x200B;

This all digressed into bigger themes of her saying she doesn't want to be with someone that ""loses their shit"" (I can be impatient sometimes, 100%, but I absolutely didn't ""lose my shit"") over trivial things and me saying that she seems to have a hard time actually hearing/listening to me and respecting how she's affecting me.  It feels like in moments like these it's her world and I'm just living in it.  It's especially frustrating because its all SUCH stupid shit and on the things that really matter we have such a strong connection.  For reference we're both mid 20's and she's \~120lbs so it's not a food thing lol.

&#x200B;

So loooooooong story short, AITA for getting frustrated she was eating off the plate while I was trying to unload the grill?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bwponh	2019-06-04 14:59:30		AITA for not wanting my boyfriend’s son around?	"My boyfriend and I live in a VERY small, one bedroom apartment. I mean, we don’t even have a dining area or a dishwasher. On top of that, my boyfriend is in a wheelchair and our apartment is not accessible. So, I end up having to do a lot of chores that he physically can’t do (which I don’t mind at all). He has an 8 year old son who lives with his ex and only spends every other weekend here. He is a sweet, intelligent little boy but he just gets on my nerves. He argues with everything I say or ask him to do, he eats and drinks on the couch when I ask him not to, he pees on the toilet seat even though we have repeatedly asked him to lift the seat, etc. I feel like these are “normal little boy things” but it gets on my nerves. But, more importantly, it seems like he takes up the whole apartment. He has to sleep on the couch (which he is happy about) but when he is on the couch, there’s no room for anyone else. Plus, it seems like he is always sick and I have a mild phobia. 
Because it’s summer time, he is out of school and will be spending weeks here at a time. I talked to my boyfriend about having him do one or two chores in order to earn a small allowance to which he agreed. I thought that one of his chores would be to clean up the couch in the morning so that we can sit there too. But, of course, he didn’t do it. 
I just went to throw some loads of laundry in the wash and came back to my boyfriend and his son hanging out in our bed watching tv. He has done this before and it BUGS me. I don’t want his son in our bed. It gets under my skin and the only reasons I can figure are because of the germs and because I just want a space that he isn’t in. I want my bed to be mine. Am I the asshole for letting all of these things bug me so bad?"		1	0

My friends that came we’re both dude and one of them I’ve known since 6/7th grade and the other is a really good friend of mine I’ve come to know this year. Well, one of them got extremely drunk and was laying on my lap talking about cheese or something as the other was sitting next to me. I took a photo of it and posted it on Snapchat. I also posted a photo of me with my female cousin (that will be handy to know later). So the next day my ex (I’ll call him mike) messaged me and basically was saying “Well good luck and goodbye” out of the blue. I was just very confused so I asked him what was going on (he’s done this so many times) and he says he was looking forward to trying things again but that I seem to want to be with other people because of the post I made! He thought that because I took a picture with some other guys that I was dating them. We got into an argument because I was so fed up with him acting this way and his willingness to write me off without even asking for clarification. Then he said “I have a short fuse” and I said “That isn’t an excuse” and he said “It’s not but can’t you take responsibility?” Then immediately texted never mind and goodnight after he said that. 

I was so pissed. What do I have to apologize for? For his insecurity? I’ve been looking at the messages wondering if somehow there is something I did to be ashamed of but I don’t see t. Maybe you do?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwpltg	2019-06-04 14:52:28	romancandle4	AITA for screwing over my partners for a good grade?	I had a chemistry project in which we had to come up with tests to identify 9 substances (every one had to identify six but we were the only group of three so we had to do all nine but that made it easier because we could use process of elimination). We managed to identify 5 of the nine and two others we made an educated guess based on physical properties and then the last two was just a guess with a fifty fifty chance. Well then we got to conclusion which we were graded separately on we each had to pick three different substances and explain the tests we used and how we identified them. Well thing is since we only legitimately PROVED 5 only those would probably count as full fledged answers and get full credit. At first partner 1 tried to call dibs on the three that were easy to prove but I wasn't having any of that he did by far the least work he didn't help with figuring out which tests to do and didn't even do any of the tests only occasionally washing out the test tube for the next test and cleaning our station. Me and partner 2 worked really hard, we collaborated and we both did about 50% of the testing. Well I managed to get myself three of the identifiable chemicals to write about (I only took one that was easy to explain while my other two required a more complex explanation) But that only left two chemicals that they could get points on. I don't know how they divided the remaining chemicals (I hope partner 2 got the two remaining ones because I would've never gotten through that lab without him) But the thing is no matter what I would be the only one able to receive full credit on my conclusion. If we had identified more I would've gladly split it with everyone or at least partner 2 but the way I saw it, it was my grade vs theirs and I chose myself over them.	Asshole	0	0
bwplro	2019-06-04 14:52:21		AITA for yelling at my roommate and girlfriend to be quite while having loud sex?	"So my roommate started seeing this girl which is totally fine. She comes by most days and is super nice to be around so I enjoy her company. However, I have a BIG problem when they start to get frisky. The first time they had sex in the apartment it sounded like they were blasting porn from his room. This girl is so loud. All the guys in the apartment found it very amusing at first because she practically screams for like 15-3 minuets straight. As time went buy it became less funny and extremely annoying. Our apartment is is very industrial so our air conditioner tubbing is not in the walls rather than a large tube that goes from room to room. This makes the sound travel much easier which doesn’t help. All of us were getting fed up with her ridiculous moans but none of us wanted to speak up. On day, at 2:30 in the morning on a week day I finally had enough. Me and my girlfriend were laying in bed unable to sleep due to how loud it was. I said “fuck this” walked out of my room and went up to his door. I pounded on the door as loud as I could and said “ For the love of God, it’s 2:30 in the God damn morning, shut the fuck up” I went back into my room and my girlfriend said it was a dick move to do that. 

She said the girl can’t help it and feels bad. I still don’t feel bad for doing what I did. If you truly can’t help SCREAMING during sex, stop having sex at 2 in the morning with an apartment of other people.

bwpl30	2019-06-04 14:50:38	cactusmalk	AITA for being mad about my family hurting my finances.	So I'll try my best to explain this without it getting too confusing, and for context I live in Canada. When I was 24(f) and my fiancee was 27(m) we had our daughter in April 2017, now my mom (I'll refer to her as M) and sisters like commandeered everything related to my pregnancy and child birth. I'm the baby of the family so this happens a lot. My sister Meghan (I'll refer to her as SM) set up my mat leave as a favour because I was so sick (and she said she knew how to do it). When my daughter was born SM offered to set up my baby bonus for me because again, she claimed to know how to do it. I wanted to just go in to service Canada and have them walk me through it, but I let her convince me. Now, during all of this I had many discussions with M and SM and my step father (SF) about how I thought me and my fiancee were common law and had to file everything as such. They swear up and down that no, that's not the case. So SM marks me as single for my baby bonus, my parents file me as single for my taxes in 2017.  Fast forward to now and my fiancee is filing his with an accountant (parents did mine) and buddy notices we've been doing it all wrong.  Looking at over $5000 owing just for the baby bonus alone, and that's a low estimate. So I obviously texted both M and SM upset and scared, and they are all refusing responsibility. Their saying they never told me l anything and that I must have told them to do it that way, and that this is my fault because I'm stupid and irresponsible. It's not even like I want them to pay it back, I should have double checked what they were saying. But I don't understand why offer to do something, end up doing it wrong and them blaming the other person who was right in the first place. It also hurts that they don't care at all how much stress this is putting me under, I've barely slept or eaten in days. It's all I can think about.	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwpf9q	2019-06-04 14:36:04	speakeasy2019	AITA for not listening to my wife tell me how I should do a presentation	"Background: For my daughter's school, the administration reached out to me to do a career day presentation as part of a larger career day event.  Approximately 30 parents were involved of varying jobs and levels.  I have a somewhat interesting job (to me) at a pharmaceutical company running a few laboratories but still able to do benchwork.  I'm at a job level where I give presentations constantly, sometimes at moments notice and I'd like to think I'm good at what I do.

Additionally, recently at our take your kid's to work day I did a 60 minute session for an auditorium of kids on exactly what I do.

There also is a bit of tension in the relationship regarding my wife's work status.  With my support my wife gave up her career to be a SAHM until our children entered full time school.  That time has come and gone, the kids have all been in school for years now and she doesn't plan to return to work.  It is somewhat OK from the money side of things since I earn a good salary, however I'd be lying if I said it wasn't an issue in my head.

Issue: Just before leaving for the presentation, my wife started in with  ""For the presentation, you should talk about..."".  That struck a pretty sour note for me since she 1) really doesn't know what I do 2) I am a skilled presenter and public speaker with fresh and relevant experience with kids of this age group.

I responded (although cutting her off) ""No, I'm already all set with the presentation, thanks"".  This didn't go over well.  On one hand I feel like the asshole for cutting her short like that before being able to contribute, but on the other hand I am still a little put off by her telling me what I should say about my career when she has a basic understanding of it at best.

I know this is going to blow up in the near future (we've been avoiding each other), and I need a bit of a calibration.

EDIT:  It looks like an asshole consensus!  Apparently I have some apologizing to do and stop avoiding some difficult discussions."	Asshole	0	0
bwpdp4	2019-06-04 14:32:17		AITA for not letting my wife's SIL babysit our daughter?	"Context: My wife and her SIL are not on the best of terms, with some long-standing conflict that hasn't been resolved mixed with some personality clashes. We're always cordial and pleasant, but it's fair to say that the two are not fast friends. We have a 10-month-old daughter who currently is in daycare full time (M-F). SIL and husband (wife's brother) make minimal effort to ask about our daughter, FaceTime with her (we live on opposite coasts), and last saw her in October 2018.

In April 2019 the SIL (28F) texted my wife to say she was coming into town for her friend's baby shower for a long weekend, and wanted to spend time with us and our daughter. We let her know we were excited to see her, and what times on Saturday would work best for us (she texted us a week prior to flying in). She then texted my wife to ask if she could take our daughter all day Monday to do ""all the baby things"" with her. I felt uncomfortable with that request for two reasons: 1) I didn't know her level of experience with babies, particularly spending all day with one, and 2) the lack of relationship between her and our daughter, and with baby 'stranger danger' not wanting to have my daughter upset all day with a new person.

My wife texted back that due to stranger danger that it would be best to focus on time together over the weekend, and to build that relationship so there could be future times where they spend together. The SIL then wrote back the following day that she was no longer feeling comfortable coming, and would not see us at all that weekend. She is now not speaking to us, and feels triggered/""deeply wounded"" by saying our daughter would have stranger danger with her. She's also claiming that she was coming into town explicitly to see us, and that we were unreasonable telling her the times we were not free that weekend (even though she texted us a week prior to flying in). It has brought up a lot of the past tensions (which I'm hoping is good long-term to mend the relationship), but AITA for drawing this line?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bwpdmr	2019-06-04 14:32:08	leeleemackay	AITA for being annoyed at co-worker needing drives for over a month?	"I work about 25 minutes away from where I live. I drive to work everyday. A coworker of mine lives somewhat close to me, still out of the way a bit but we’ve occasionally carpooled for meetings, etc. I don’t mind picking my coworker up every once in a while. About a month ago, my coworkers car was having an issue. They took it to their mechanic, who is actually about 2 hours away from where they live but it’s the mechanic they’ve always used and their parents use. The problem is they had no guarantee about when they could check the vehicle over. They weren’t able to look at it for almost 3 weeks meaning it sat over 2 hours away in a lot. The issue the car was having wasn’t one where it was causing the car to not drive, it was a light that kept coming on. 

My boss suggested to my coworker to rent a car since they had no guarantee when they’d get the car even looked at. For some reason my coworker chose not to do this, and has been asking for drives for the entire month. At first it was fine, but then they started asking for drives on days where I didn’t work until later than them, meaning I would be going into work hours before my shift started. I have a hard time saying no because I want to help out, but it’s become an extreme inconvenience for me and my day to day life. On top of that, this coworker is extremely negative. I tried encouraging them and listening to their problems and tried genuinely offering advice, but it’s like they never even absorb it and everyday it’s more and more negative. It’s affecting my own mood and day at work because after having that type of conversation on the entire drive to work I feel emotionally drained. On top of it all it makes me feel guilty to say no because I know that I’ll be made to feel bad if they can’t find a way to work, even though it’s not my responsibility to drive them to work.

She mentions how she has a boyfriend and everyone asked to see a picture. She didn't want to show one, so people started coming to the conclusion that it was fake. She finally shows us a photo and it's of a relatively attractive guy. People began to ask questions about how long they've been dating (three months), have they ever went anywhere together (yes to the movies), and what they talked about. So at this point there's like twelve of us girls all looking on his facebook page (which only had one photo) and reading through their messages.

bwp7pe	2019-06-04 14:17:29	Panzram-ifications	AITA for being mad that no one picked up the phone after my grandmother disappeared?	"Last night my grandmother with severe dementia went missing from her nursing home. My parents came to check on her that night at 7-8 pm, they discovered that no one had seen her (or her dog) since 4.

&#x200B;

My sister and I left our homes to help look. I texted my two closest friends a brief rundown and ask for them to call me in an hour to check up on me. One friend, B, texted back saying that she would try, but she might fall asleep. My other friend, O, does not answer. It was 9 pm at this time.

&#x200B;

The nursing home is a new build, surrounded by unfinished suburban home construction, four lane roads/highways, woods, and dead ends. At around 9:41 pm, I stumble and nearly fall into a large hole. The fog of panic clears and I realize that I'm walking around in a pitch black construction zone. Despite the police and volunteers crawling around, they are looking for an elderly woman with a walker and a dog, not a twenty-something scrawny girl with good intentions and shit judgement. I was abruptly very, very aware that if something happened to me where I couldn't dial 911 fast enough, no one would know and it scared the shit out of me.

&#x200B;

I decide that I would feel a lot safer to have someone on the phone with me, that way if the line suddenly goes dead, someone would know something was wrong. All my relatives are on the phone making calls to other relatives and search teams as they look. I call B. No one picks up. I call O. No one picks up. I call my ex-BF (we broke up on good terms and have transitioned to friends) as I know his sleep schedule, and he doesn't even think of heading to bed til at least 1 AM. He does not pick up either. At this point, I'm scrolling through my phone in between short bursts of searching trying to figure who else I can call when my father calls me back. It takes a while, but we find each other, hop in his car, and continue our search along the roads.  
 

At 10:30 pm O texts me asking if I'm okay and if I still need her to call me. I update her, but I'm mostly distracted with the search. Due to the character limit I can’t go into detail, but she was found, and I make it home at 12 AM. Ex-BF texts me at 3 AM asking if I'm alright.

&#x200B;

I woke up furious this morning. My family went missing for hours, she could've died, I could've been hurt - if I was on the hearing end of my texts and calls, I would've come down to help, or at the very least stayed up all night with them. I would've NEVER texted to ask if someone was okay, especially if they requested that I called, since this was such a serious situation - and I feel that no one took this as seriously as it was. 

However, I have BPD, so I'm not good with emotions, so I'm honestly unsure if I'm reacting right. There could've been a bunch of reasons for no one to pick up, so I don't want to over-react, but I really needed somebody to help and I feel so abandoned and mad about it.

bwp5pw	2019-06-04 14:12:26	Call_Me_Rambo	WIBTA if I put all my groceries in my room?	"So I am roommates with my sister (I DO NOT recommend). In our household , everything you buy is yours and doesn’t have to be shared. Or at least that’s *normally* the case. 

I eat more than a lot of people. Hell I eat more than people that are almost twice my weight most of the time. I’m also trying to bulk up as I go to the gym, so I have to get  plenty of groceries that can last me day after day.  I assumed I could just leave my groceries in the pantry and fridge and expect them to be untouched as of course, I didn’t buy them to share because then they last me an even shorter time.

My sister doesn’t spend a single cent towards the groceries I bring home. She rarely does grocery shopping herself and just gets fast food or just makes spaghetti. Yet I’ll check the fridge and see this and that grocery item of mine has been depleted somewhat or opened already. This annoys me because I’m trying to make these groceries last as long as possible because I’m trying to save money so I can treat myself for once. (I haven’t been able to for a long time but that’s a whole entirely different thing.)

*Hey OP, just ask or tell her to stop ya goof!* 
I’ve actually tried that. Before we lived in an apartment together we lived with our mother and I was doing the same thing then that I do now, buying groceries to make me last and such. Long story short within another story, my sister came back from college (300 miles away), ate my groceries, I assumed she mistook them for ones my mother purchased and very kindly, even in a joking manner, told her they were actually mine. She told me to shut the fuck up and that she didn’t care. I was actually kinda taken aback by that so I didn’t even know how to react. 

Also more info on my sister, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple years ago. And for about as long as I’ve known her, she gets into incredible rages when she does not get what she wants. I witnessed her cuss out our own aunt (the 2nd closest family member in her life to her) because my aunt was worried she might be developing a drug and alcohol addiction(as a minor) and was pleading she just tone it down a bit. Basically, if I believe if I tell her to stop again, she’ll lose it, I’ll lose it and we’ll be a divided household. 

Today I wanted to one of my favorite desserts. It comes in a box and there’s 6 of em. I get it and there was one left. That brings the total of how many of it I’ve had to 3. Yeah, she ate the other 3. So instead of going the petty route and start eating whatever she brings home, I’m close to thinking I should just buy a mini fridge and shelf to keep in my room to just keep her away from my groceries. 

AITA if I do this?

TL;DR
Sister keeps eating groceries she doesn’t pay for. Telling her stop would most likely anger her and divide us. I will probably keep my all groceries in my room now."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwp3io	2019-06-04 14:06:50		AITA for ignoring a guy at a party?	"So, about 3 months ago I marked myself as “going” to a friend’s party on Facebook.  A couple of days before the party, a guy I’ve never met before messaged me on Facebook to say “Hey, say you were going to so-and-so’s party and we’re from the same hometown!  Sorry for the creepy message haha.”  I was mildly weirded out, but had a brief conversation notwithstanding.  

The night of the party, I don’t plan on staying very long because I have another thing to go to.  I get there pretty early, and run into an acquaintance.  We talk for awhile, and I bounce around to other people as closer friends of mine arrive.  I never notice the guy who messaged me on Facebook, and he never approached me.

When I go to leave the party, I walk up to the aforementioned acquaintance and give him a hug and say bye.  I notice he’s talking to the Facebook guy, but since I’m running out I don’t want to engage in a new conversation.  I just flash a smile and head out.

On my way to the next party, I shoot a text to the acquaintance saying it was nice seeing him and we should hang out again soon.  He never replies, which I think is weird but figure he just isn’t interested anymore.  

Cut to a week ago, I’m at a tea dance (for the non-gays, read this is as a “daytime social/dance party”) and I spot Facebook guy.   I need a break from my friends I was with, so I strike up a conversation.  It takes him a bit to realize where I knew him from, and the conversation goes nowhere interesting.  BUT, the reason I am writing this post was that one of my friends was talking to one of Facebook guy’s friends whom I have never met before.  My friend say to Facebook’s friends “Oh, do you know (my name)?” He replies “Oh, (my name)? He was a total asshole to my friend.”

Now I’m worried this whole subset of people (including the above acquaintance) think I’m some douchebag for ignoring this guy! So, Reddit, am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

We have separate finances and we share the house expenses 50-50. I think that it's natural we get our own food and cook our own meals, that way everyone can eat what they like and spend food money in whatever way they want and it shouldn't be a problem. 

It's not like he's not allowed to eat my food, I mean, of course we can share if I have or cook something he likes (withour abusing), I just don't think this should be the assumed standard. 

I think that if we were roomates this would be the most logical arrangement and the fact that we have intimacy doesn't change the fact we have separate finances.

bwp1mm	2019-06-04 14:02:09		AITA for not accepting my mom's gift for my birthday	"Okay, I know I'm the asshole 100% but I just need others to confirm.

For the past 3 to 4 weeks, I haven't been speaking with my mother at all. And the thing is the only reason why I did that was because I'm sick of depending on her all the time and had enough of her ""sweet-talk"" which she'll basically manipulate and push me into talking about my job which I shouldn't. because I work with a lot of sensitive information and documents.

My birthday is today, and to be honest I was excited at first because my co-worker and boss got me excited about it. 23 now, but anyway when my family tells me through text or says it without looking at me its doesn't bring out any emotion in me. With exceptiong of my sister, although she tryings, with her smiles and being nice. I can't return it in kind.

The night before my sister gave me $5.00, not to be a choosingbeggar, but looking at that bill makes me feel sad. I don't need it and I know if I give it back, she'll get mad at me.

But this morning, I'm still living with my mom, I wish I didn't but I have no place to go, no vehicle and my job doesn't pay well at all. She send me a text, wishing me a happy birthday than this..

""*Even tho you hate me
Because I seem like I am 
Invisible to you.
My wish is that you find happiness in you.
And wish you all the best in your life.*""

I'm the A-hole right here, because I haven't been speaking to her, and when I do, I answer with closed answers. She already attack me at work with personal question. Good timing too since no one was around.

I was getting ready when she open my door and throw a bag at me. When I look it was a necklace. I don't need a necklace even if the thought counts as a gift. My mind is already black and white. At first I throw the gift elsewhere in my room but decided after I was ready to ride my two wheel pedaling machine. I placed it where my mom can find it. I then texted her back...

""**I'm sorry to be the asshole but I don't need a necklace or gifts. Keep it or give it to someone else because I left it on the little mirror in the hallway. Again sorry**""

After this I turn off my phone, I hate expression my emotion at work. If my eyes go red. I'll blame it on allergies. Once that next was sent, she text me back saying that I'll be paying rent from now on.

Do I care that I'll being paying rent? No not really.  At least she'll have gas money now. I'll still be riding me bike even if it storms or rains outside.

bwp0pw	2019-06-04 14:00:02	SadisticSienna	AITA: for telling my mum to screw off and wanting to cut her out of my life	"So my family including my mum has been constantly horrible to me for the last 2 years roughly, it wasn't great before that but no where near as bad. Being emotionally abusive and picking on me. Started dating my boyfriend a bit over a year ago. They picked on him too.

Anyway they would constantly tell me (26 - with disabilities) to move out and generally terrorize me.
Many examples of the terrorization (banning my only friend from coming over for a year because my sister had a baby and threatening me with violence, not letting me use the bath, constantly yelling at me, not letting me use the main shower, forcing my boyfriend to park in an unsafe spot which resulted in a car smashing into it parked) but Ill keep it on point. To the point me and my boyfriend actively tried to move out to get away.

So we get accepted for a place and was not sure if we should accept because it was near exam finals. My mum insists I should accept the rental and pushes me hard saying I don't need to move all my stuff out and can do it over time. So I stupidly believe her and accept.

On day we are moving her and my sister suddenly change tune and demand I move literally everything out that day after saying I don't have to. So I have to stay there for hours packing every single thing in my room that was hard to pack (some 20 liquor and alcohol bottles I collected) and my boyfriend goes to work.

Then my mum now 1.5 weeks after the move is saying shes going to bring my quilt over ($150 quilt) and Im like ok thinking its nice of her. But That suddenly turns into her bringing some 15 boxes of my other stuff out of the garage. Im like oh no and try to get her to not because our place is small and the loungeroom is full of boxes because our shed is already full of empty boxes from the move.  Since we hadn't had our curbside pick up yet. She won't take no for an answer and demands we take it (bear in mind its pouring down rain and I just finished a final exam) and we get mad and tell her to f#ck off. Then we stupidly think she didn't come and think to ourselves we will pick it up soon.

But when we go outside we see shes dumped everything in the drive way (including glassware in boxes, quilts, art, books, my christmas tree) in the pouring rain and some stuff appears to be missing or damaged (books).

Now shes threatening she won't look after my fish and just let them die as well after she said she would as a manipulation to get me to move before id moved them to my friends.

I'm just so angry and hate this woman. All she does is lie and shes so selfish."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwp0go	2019-06-04 13:59:17		AITA For not giving someone a chance, because they have kids?	"I'm 21F and I say I'm not dating, but I am. A guy 26M who has 2 children a boy and a girl, I don't know their exact ages but they are in primary school so I'm guessing between 4-10yrs old with the girl being the eldest. Anyway, I am on dating apps ect. but I don't use them all the time and don't take them super seriously, but I started talking to this guy and before I knew it he began following me on one of my social media's and I had matched with him but until I looked on his profile at his photo's, he had not stopped to tell me or even insinuate he has children. It's not on his dating profile and there aren't any pictures of either of them.

&#x200B;

I am trying to start a career, I'm going to Kavos for my birthday in a few weeks which is a party planned out, I go to the gym regularly and somehow my life is coming together but I'm not financially stable I want to experience being young. ANYWAY somehow the conversation got to where he admitted he had kids. I'll be honest, I don't mind kids and someday I'll want them but I feel odd about dating someone with kids.. This isn't the first time either, I flat out refuse to date someone with kids because that is my preference, he comes off as a loving father too. He dresses, looks and acts younger than he is but I can't get over this fact that he's got children, it's a turn off for me personally. I know situations and circumstances can lead to this but I don't feel ready for that responsibility.

&#x200B;

BUT instead of letting it be known I'm no longer interested, I'm trying to make the conversation dim down, giving bland replies, generally being like a wet towel to talk to but he's still attempting to talk to me.. Which makes me feel worse. He's not a bad person and still has (what I assume) is a good mutual relationship with the mother of his kids.

&#x200B;

I don't want to make him to think his kids would hold him back in dating BUT it's just not for me. I can't tell him that him having children put me off meeting him because I don't want him to be shy or give up on meeting people because he has kids. How do I put it nicely? I FEEL TOO YOUNG TO BE IN THIS SITUATION and HE DIDN'T TELL ME UPFRONT AND WE TALK ALOT.

&#x200B;

AITA for writing someone off because they have kids? And then being too afraid to be judged by said person when I tell him I'm no longer interested due to his kids?   


tldr; nice guy doesn't tell me has kids, i find out he has kids. immediately go cold on him because i feel too young"		1	0

I minding my own business head to the ladies room one morning, swing open the door and find my very large co-worker standing at the sink eating a can of oysters with no shirt on. I was shocked, turned my eyes to the floor and hurried into the nearest stall. She laughed and said something like ""I hope you didn't flash anyone in the hall"" as she was standing in her bra right in front of the hallway door inside the bathroom. I did not answer as I was in shock and did not know what to say. While in the stall I was frantically trying to decide how to handle washing my hands. I really hate confrontation. I decide the best thing to do is to just act like everything is normal, wash my hands and leave. As I am washing my hands she acts surprised and says she forgot she didn't have a shirt on and says something like she is sorry. I awkwardly  said ""You're fine"" and hauled ass out of there. I haven't been able to look her in the eye since. Her excuse was she had to eat something before she took some medication, the canned oysters was all she had and she didn't want her clothes to smell like them.

Now this is not the first time I have walked into the bathroom to find her doing something weird. The first time I walked in and she was in the handicap stall peeing with the door open hanging halfway out of it (still do not understand the physics of that). I let that go because she said it was because she **really** had to go and didn't have time to shut the door that was clearly within reach, but whatever. Until one of my co-workers came to me on a different day and said they had just walked in on her doing the same thing again. And then a week later another co-worker said it happened to her too.

I am starting to think she is either completely ignorant of work place bathroom etiquette or she is doing this on purpose because she gets off on people seeing her or she is actually trying to get fired by doing weird shit.

Am I the asshole if I go to our supervisor and say something? I do not want to get someone else fired. I understand people have different life experiences and maybe doing that is perfectly normal for her. But I am stressing every time I go to the restroom because I am worried she will be in there.  Or should I take her aside and talk to her about it myself? Am I making too big of a deal about this? Should I just laugh it off?"		1	0

"A few friends and I have been planning to visit each other for a year, with serious plans being made since the start of this year. I realized around the start of the year, when the plans were getting more serious, that I wouldn’t be able to afford to go, and said I would have to miss out this year, but my friends insisted to not worry, they would pay for the flight. After that, RL got bad for me and I’ve been flaky and bad at initiating communication. I then found out I wouldn’t be able to go even with the tickets paid, and apologized again and backed out. Two weeks later, one of my friends approached me and asked me to pay for the plane ticket. I said that was unfair because I’d never been able to pay for it (and still can’t), but her argument is that I have been a bad friend and she didn’t want the group/her to pay for someone who wouldn’t put effort into the relationship. When she first asked me to pay, I told her I would pay but that I was frustrated that she was asking for it, and I don’t want to go back on my word, but the more I think about it, the less fair it seems.

bwox52	2019-06-04 13:50:07	ADudeWhoPostsHere	AITA for requesting that my in-laws stay one less day?	"Every year during the first week in June, my life is crazy. June 6 is my wedding anniversary, June 8 is my son's birthday, and June 10 is my wife's birthday. Things get even crazier when you factor in the parties that must happen around these events. It means household guests, family, etc. 

This past weekend, we went to my wife's parents' house all weekend. My wife wanted to leave Friday after work (I work, she doesn't). I was a good sport about it. We went along and had fun, but it ultimately meant no ""real"" weekend for me in any way, right? Fine, whatever. 

This coming weekend, we have my son's party, and both her parents and her brother are coming to stay overnight. Fine. I had it in my head that they'd only be staying Saturday night, so I was thinking, ""well, at least I'll have Friday night to myself."" Alone time is super important to me as I'm an introvert!

The weekend AFTER this coming weekend, we have to make a long drive out of state for our niece's graduation party (wife's side). Fine. Family, right? This is the stuff you have to do. 

So this morning as I'm leaving for work, my wife informs me that her parents will also be staying Friday night this coming weekend (in addition to Saturday). I know it seems like a small thing, but it's really fucking annoying me. Can I not have one weekend night to myself during this string of three weekends with her family? 

I should also note that the graduation party weekend will mean father's day will be spent driving home from out of state. I'm trying to not be a martyr about it. It's not like I need a new tie or brunch as a matter of course, but it's the principle, right? 

So anyway, I sent my wife a note this morning after I got to work basically demanding that she have her parents just come Saturday morning before my son's party instead.

My bff and I (3 years) made a new friend who is similar to me. But we are all alike. We had a group chat. We have all side stepped a few times, that’s human. New friend said some things about my bff’s back. First I was shocked so I didn’t say much. The next time the conversation when like:

“Can I complain about (bff)?” - new friend 

“Sure, just have in mind that she’s my BEST friend.” - me

New friend kept her mouth shut. At some point, I guess I told bff about this. That was my mistake, I don’t remember doing it. But anyway, I her that new friend doesn’t exactly talk about her back, she just... complains. Which isn’t much better.

Lately bff’s behavior has been extremely childish. Like almost trashing my place and then leaving. She obviously has a bit of a grudge towards new friend now, which sucks. I took some distance from both of them doing exam season so I could just focus.

We have a group chat. Us three. New friend send a couple of memes the past few days, and they were funny. I like them. Bff texted “that’s true 😂😂😂” or whatever in the chat. 

Then immediately after texts me this: “why does she send those things to the group???” And then in a new text. “It stresses me out she has time to send those things when I’m under so much pressure.”

I was shook. Especially since bff always says she hates fake people. At this point I was fed up and didn’t even know how to react, so I send these three messages:

“Are you dumb” - not a question 
“Then leave the group chat.”
“Wtf.”

She just replied never mind. And I get why.
Am I being an asshole here? Should I not distance myself? We are 18-20. I hate liars and I value loyalty highly. My bff knows this. I’m willing to let things slide, people learn from their mistakes. But I’m not gonna be sweet about it"		1	0

I got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. I had to pick her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out, but I also told her I was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

I work 0700 to 1600, but most days I'm here till 1645ish finishing work up or just trying to avoid the traffic. I do not get paid a cent of overtime.

The incident happened last week. I was working all day, skipped my lunch break so I could make a conference call and keep working. I ended up staying to almost 1700 so we could finish the project that day instead of making it run into the next day. We finished around 1640±. 

&#x200B;

After finishing, I loaded up Reddit to just browse for a little bit before leaving as it was raining and I CBA to get wet walking to the subway. My boss walks past my desk and says (quite loudly) ""Ooh, I see, on Reddit, are we? We don't pay you to sit on Reddit at work"" this pissed me off, I had stayed late (unpaid) and was just chilling out for 5m.

bwotkj	2019-06-04 13:40:24	altinourclosets	AITA for not refunding a Craigslist item?	"I listed an essential new A/V receiver on Craigslist that I purchased last year, but didn't really like. It worked fine, but had some usability issues. I only used the L/R/C audio channels.

  


I met someone who purchased it and provided the original receipt because they wanted to be able to use the warranty if something on it failed. The receipt had my name and my (incorrect, unbeknownst to him) address. The purchase price was about $50 less than what it's been going for used on eBay--I gave him a great deal.

  


The next day, he messaged me that one of the rear surround channels didn't work and accused me of ripping him off. I told him I didn't know about that, but that it's the manufacturers fault not mine. And that he would have to contact the manufacturer to get it fixed.



He then said he had my address (he didn't) and asked if I wanted him to come over and discuss in person. I said I have no way of knowing that he didn't break it. AITA for being offended by his accusation and not offering to allow him to get his money back?


UPDATE: I offered to take it back and refund his money if it was returned in the same condition I gave it to him. We met and had a good time talking for a while before getting to business--we had a lot in common. 

He said he was looking at his text again and felt bad that he seemed threatening. He said he didn't mean to be like that and showed regret. He apologized profusely about it and when I handed him his money back, he even gave me $20 to keep for my trouble! He understood that I didn't have to do this refund for him and the $20 was a very nice gesture I was not expecting."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bworb2	2019-06-04 13:34:10	Chemical_Imagination	WIBTA if I continues to be open about my weed habit?	"A little background: My parents came to the US from mexico so their idea of weed is that it’s evil and bad for you. I’m 20, college students, full time EMT, and casual weed smoker. I do my best to chip in with expenses so I try to give them at least $100 a week, more depending on how many hours I work that week.

I’ve recently been getting into arguments with my parents about my weed use. I used to lie to them and try to keep it a secret when I was a teenager but they would eventually find out. Now that I’m an adult I wanted to change things by being honest with them about my use and that my opinion on weed will always be different from theirs. The issue I have with this is that they genuinely feel hurt whenever I come home and smell like weed. They feel like failures as parents. I don’t want them to feel bad about themselves just because I smoke weed. At the same time I don’t want to give up a habit I enjoy just because they believe the reefer madness propaganda they learned back in Mexico. My older brothercalls me a selfish asshole for being so open about it. He says I should just lie to them and say I won’t do it anymore. I do feel like being open with them about it is the best way to go about this but maybe I’m not thinking about this clearly. So WIBTA for being open with my family about smoking weed?

Edit: So I do live with my parents at the moment but I do my best to keep support them financially. Many of have said that I should try and educate them about the topic. I have tried countless times and have gotten nowhere. They are aware that their beliefs are very narrow because they grew up in a very different time and place. They choose to think the way that they do because they have told me they think they’re “too
old to change.” Also, I usually keep the weed habit to myself as much as I can. I don’t go out of my way to make sure they know I smoke, but if they ask me if I did it I tell them the truth. Hope this clears up a few things."	No A-holes here	0	0

bwoqbp	2019-06-04 13:31:30		AITA for sleeping with the guy my friend cheated on her boyfriend with?	"This is actually a painfully, senselessly long story so I’ll try to compact it as much as possible (only the most important details). 

One day, I ran into my friend with a guy. I said hi to them and she introduced him to me as her friend. I believed this to be true because she had a boyfriend. I found him extremely attractive from the start (which I was pretty excited about as I don’t experience that often). We talked and he made it pretty clear that he was attracted to me as well. My friend talked primarily about her boyfriend and how excited she was to see him again. Before we parted ways, the the guy gave me his phone to enter my number into.

He and I texted for a day before I got surprised by a random text from my friend. I say “random” because she and I actually hadn’t spoken in some time as a result of her feeling competitive with me and wanting to distance herself (her words). She basically asked if we could meet up in person. So we did, and there she confessed that she had been cheating on her boyfriend with that guy for almost a week. She attributed it to feeling ignored by him (her boyfriend). She then said that she was done sleeping with him, but she still wanted to keep him as a friend. After saying this, she told me that she wasn’t ok with us getting involved because she didn’t want me to take away from their friendship and hinder them from getting closer. 

I asked her if she had feelings for him and she said no, and that she loved her boyfriend. She reiterated that she just wanted to grow their friendship without any distractions. I can admit right now that I was wrong for this, but I told her I understood. I was wrong for that because I was actually very annoyed by her thinking she could tell me who (not) to see, especially when we hadn’t spoken for a while before this.

So, he and I continued texting, which led to meeting up to hang out. Which, of course, eventually led to going home together. My friend found out (though I wasn’t trying to hide it) and went ballistic. I mean a full mental breakdown with threats of violence to top it off. She turned people against me, called me evil and the sort and apparently self-harmed. Ironically, she is now staying with her boyfriend. 

I know that what I did wasn’t right per-se, but am I really as wrong as she’s making me out to be?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bwoo7o	2019-06-04 13:25:31		AITA Babysat, cleaned out a kids hoarder room (at the request of the parents) now they’re mad at me	"This weekend I babysat for a family I’ve known since high school. The youngest has issues with anxiety adhd and i think she’s developmentally delayed, I don’t remember her diagnosis’s exactly.   Her behavior reminds me of like a 7 year old, maybe younger, sucks her thumb, needs to cuddle to feel safe would come into where I was sleeping cause she got scared, she’s almost 13.  The family had to go out of town for a funeral,it was an 8 hour drive and she would have been miserable so they asked me if I could take her. I used to watch her in high school. I took the job and I was told if I got her room cleaned out they’d pay me extra. Sounded good to me. 

I went to check out her room and I was floored, it was hip deep floor to floor garbage.  I felt morally responsible as the adult in the house to make sure she had a clean room to live in, a clean bed and clean clothes. She and I BUSTED ASS this weekend. (In between hiking with the dogs, a diy spa day and trips to the zoo) 
At one point while cleaning, while she was sorting clothing, I cried as quietly as I could  behind her bed cause I felt so terrible about how she was living. I have issues with anxiety and it manifests as a hoarder nest around me and I just saw a younger me in my room. The older sister (a friend of mine) found me hyperventilating on the second day.  We got through the garbage, a dozen bags about. And started sorting toys and stuffed animals. I told her she could keep as many toys as she could fit in the storage in her room and everything had to be in a place not just on the ground. She was fine with these rules and we gathered about 6 bags to donate. 

We found a local women’s shelter that she wanted to donate to and I stacked the donation bags in the living room. While we were cleaning I found out that she didn’t have any clean clothes in her room, other than in her dresser she couldn’t open because of the garbage, so she would go to the laundry room in the basement every day to get random pieces of clothing to wear. So I washed ALL of her clothing and bedding.  

Her room is beautiful now. She likes making youtube videos so when we found some string lights with bees on it we set up a cute backdrop for her to film, green screen included curtesy of a green blanket we found.  The closet is organized, all of the clothes clean, folded and put away. She loves her room now too.

The problem is the mom is mad that I’ve thrown away or put stuff in donation that she feels weren’t supposed to be. She picked a bunch of stuff out and put it back in her room. I feel that since every item that wasn’t damaged I ran through the kid and asked what she wanted to do with it. AITA for throwing things away?"		1	0

Yesterday it was 98 degrees and there’s no shade at the camp site and we’re pretty understaffed so I was made the head tennis coach, and last night I had to go to the hospital for an IV because I was so incredibly dehydrated despite drinking a ton of water. I’m also so sunburnt I can barely move, so I’m really considering quitting. I also have very bad beat diarrhea and a constant low level headache.

bwomjo	2019-06-04 13:20:53		AITA for being upset that my brother and SIL have planned for us to fly out for our annual family holiday on my wedding anniversary?	"We try to have an annual family holiday, which is becoming more complex to arrange as the family grows. It is normally my parents, my siblings, their spouses, myself, my husband and my two nieces. The holidays and all spending money whilst we are out there are paid for in full by my parents. My parents have asked my brother and SIL to choose the dates and destination for the holiday as they have two children and are the least flexible, as in the past they have refused to attend if they feel the destination is too hot for the children etc.

&#x200B;

This year my brother and SIL have chose the school summer holiday period for the family holiday, as my SIL works in a school and my niece attends school, so they have restricted holidays. The school summer holiday period lasts for 6 weeks, and the holiday this year will be for around 10 days. In the midst of the first week of the holidays is my niece's birthday, so understandably my brother and SIL do not want to be on holiday then as they want to have my SIL's family be present for my niece's birthday. At the beginning of the second week is mine and DH's 2nd wedding anniversary, which is when my brother and SIL have proposed we fly out. My parents are happy to proceed with this date and I think this is because neither they or my brother and SIL see a wedding anniversary as something to really celebrate as they don't really tend to themselves. Last year, DH and I went on holiday alone for our anniversary, so they could assume we would want to celebrate it in some way. Also note that there aren't limited flights to our destination, so flying out later that week or even a week later would not be an issue.

&#x200B;

I am quite unhappy that with a 6 week period they have chose our anniversary to fly out on and not considered us at all. I tend to do most of the planning for family events, and the vast majority of the time it tends to be heavily based around what suits my brother and SIL best as they have children. And I guess I am just a bit upset that when there has been an opportunity for them to consider DH and I, that they haven't. AITA for being upset about this?"		1	0

I work in a retail position and I’m normally on the register to let people buy stuff. Of course this is the brunt of where shitty people really shine, as most retail employees know.

It was a really rough day. I had to come in on a shift I wasn’t scheduled for and I was already pissed with management for not listening to my schedule. I was also running around to do online orders and labour and helping customers on the floor and it was just a huge mess since two people called in sick. I was exhausted. Furthermore, the boomers that came out to play were worse behaved than normal. Basically, my patience was wearing thin.

So then this couple comes along. I greet them and request their membership info, and they... well, didn’t say anything. So I just carried on. The female then got mad about the fact I didn’t take her phone number. I explained that the male said you didn’t have one. She then gave me her phone number and I entered it, and they gave each other some smirky look. I was suspicious.

I was scanning their stuff and their items were in big boxes, and one of them was a soft mat for a dog crate. I was pulling the mat across when little papers I’m supposed to put into every bag ended up falling all over the floor. The male kicked some papers towards me, but he didn’t help, and he kicked the ones that were more in his way than anything. I quickly scanned the items in their cart and then picked up the papers, but I was so tired from earlier and my back was DYING, and I groaned. I then heard the female chuckle and when I glance up, she’s pointing at me and whispering something to her friend. 

This is when I place the papers on my till and mumble “thanks for your help,” and hand them their receipt. The male then unloads on me, shouting “OH, YOU’RE WELCOME,” and then I kind of snapped and told him that maybe if he and his wife weren’t too busy making fun of me and giggling like idiots, maybe he could’ve acted more like a decent and respectful member of society, and that acting too cool for service workers makes him look like a dickless jerk. They abruptly left. 

AITA? I just really, really wasn’t having it.

Minor edit: I normally do not snap at customers and have a very good reputation at work based on surveys and comments and manager observations. It was the pointing and laughing and shit that really got under my skin and I couldn’t hold back anymore."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Turns out, he was running 20 minutes behind this morning. He saw me standing in the shower, looking at the ground under the spray and told me, ""I'm gonna need to get in there."" I told him I wasn't finished yet, that I would hand him out his shampoo, and that we had 2 other showers he could use (1 is even on the same floor). I don't remember exactly how it went, but he told me if I had just been standing in the shower, finished, I would have needed to move, so he could shower. If he had even just asked, I would have hurried up.

I'm a little irritated that he would interrupt the few minutes of relaxation I have with work, kids, and other commitments instead of simply showering in a different shower when he was late anyway.

I tried to talk to him about it after, but he told me I was making it a big deal and refused to talk about it. He was clearly angry. At no point did I raise my voice or use angry language.

I work straight 10 hour days at a government job.  We don't have time clocks, we simply fill out time cards, and we are monitored to make sure we aren't showing up late or dipping out early.  I usually get there a few minutes early and start working so right there I'm donating a few minutes of my time each day.  Not a huge deal.  Every now and again I stay late for emergencies and do get paid overtime for that.

I work until 9pm.  I usually start wrapping up around 8:50 and shutting down my station because I have to make several stops on my way out to drop things off to a few places and then leave at 9.  I sometimes don't time it well and end up getting out 5 or so minutes late that I don't get paid for.  Again, not a huge deal because it's usually my own fault.

So, the other night I'm wrapping up.  It's less than 10 minutes before my shift is done and I'm just getting one more thing done before I start heading out.  Then the phone rings.  I answer and one of my co-workers asks me to bring some batteries to his station.  Well, it *is* my job to supply stuff like that, but my shift is almost done and I don't have time to bring them without leaving late, unpaid.  I tell him ""Can't do it, I'm about to leave, sorry man, no time.""  He answers ""Really?  It'll just take a few minutes.  Come on man, we need batteries down here.""  I still refuse, and he's not especially happy and seems to think I'm being petty.

Was I being petty?  It was a small ask, but people there know what time I leave and they have kind of a bad habit of calling me or requesting things at the last minute, just as I'm about to walk out the door.

bwogb8	2019-06-04 13:03:50	anastasia_dedonostia	WIBTA for reporting a breeder?	"About a month ago my boyfriend and I bought a thoroughbred kitten from a breeder. She’s been doing this for around 15 years and has won a ton of awards from cat shows.

My boyfriend and I show up and her house is disgusting. Messy which is understandable, but I mean filthy- smelled so strongly of piss I started feeling sick after around 10 minutes. We even saw one of the males jump up on a table and piss right in front of us.

She’s got like 12 cats running around, 4 adults and the rest listens from 2 recent litters. The mom of the cat we adopted was already sequestered with a male so that they could mate- this cat had just given birth to 7 kittens 3 months prior. 

There was another pregnant cat who just seemed in such bad shape, so tired and just... not having it. I don’t know much about breeders or breeding cats, but that house does NOT seem up to code- and making a female get pregnant a mere 3 months after giving birth seems cruel.

We were there for a while talking to this lady and filling out paperwork and whatnot and she shares a bit about her life with us- she has limited mobility from a recent surgery and persistent back problems. She’s divorced and has two grown kids but from what we could gather- they both live pretty far away and she doesn’t seem to hear from them often. We are pretty sure that her livelihood is breeding these cats, but in her current state, I think she has become completely overwhelmed with it and is now really going overboard on the breeding and selling of her cats which most people do as more of a hobby unless they have a TON of space/ability to do it right.

I’m pretty sure that if we reported her she’d lose her licence and maybe her cats- it would probably destroy her financially and emotionally since despite everything, she loves her cats. I just really think those animals are not being treated properly, and I think she needs to stop what she’s doing since she clearly is incapacitated.

WIBTA?

*Edit* Ok, I am definitely feeling like an asshole for going to a breeder. Never done it before and won't ever do it again. Once my boyfriend gets home I'm going to talk with him and we're going to do something.

"I have recently relocated to a new state where I was supposed to transfer to a new store and work part-time there. As it has happened, the move did not go as smoothly as planned. I have run into some major hiccups with my living situation that has caused a great deal of stress and anxiety for me. I was homeless for about two weeks and got into my new place just a few days ago. Needless to say, the transition has been and continues to be pretty rough as I do not know anyone in my new area.

If everything went as planned, I was supposed to start at the new store this week. However, with the transition and my situation, it just isn’t feasible for me to work part-time retail. I have instead been focusing on finding a full-time admin role that could help me gain more relevant experience and further my career. Basically, my situation, needs, desires have changed.

A few days ago I got a call from the manager at my new store telling me my schedule for the upcoming week with less than a few days notice. I let them know of my current situation and that I was sorry but would no longer be able to work because of everything going on. They have since contacted me multiple times after I told them I would like to be terminated. They have been overly pushy and rude to get their “scheduling needs fulfilled.” They have twisted my words into making this an entirely different situation than it is. They even went as far as contacting my previous manager and asking them to reach out to me to convince me to stay.

This manager has been constantly contacting me out of their business need (which I totally understand) but is toxic and disrespectful to my situation. I believe they are manipulating me and others in order to have me to stay with the company and fulfill her scheduling needs. Let’s be honest, I don’t know this person and this is retail, I doubt this person honestly cares about me and my situation. They have said things like, “we can offer you hours and income while you clearly need the support” and “we hate to see you leave on bad terms in which you would not be eligible for rehire.”  

I get that I put them in a bad spot by telling them I wouldn’t be able to work so last minute, but I feel like their response is unnecessary and inappropriate. Maybe I’m completely off track, AITA?"		1	0
bwoes0	2019-06-04 12:59:44	swagdu69eme	AITA for coming back to the same place at a concert after going to the bathroom?	"I was with a couple of friends, but the only one that is relevant to the situation was a guy I'll call Tim.

Yesterday, I went to a concert with a few mates. We met up about an hour before to hang out and drink together. We have some fun and join the queue a bit early. We get into the venue, buy other drinks and go to the standing area.

Some context: we're all guys and I'm somewhat tall (6'2""), so I know that standing behind me sucks.

After the side event with an artist no one seemed to know (he was quite good), Tim and I decided to go to the bathroom. I naively believed that going back to the same place wouldn't be a problem. We finish our business quickly and get back to our friends, with condescending glares I could empathise with on our way throught the crowd.

However, a guy next to me (to my right, not behind me) told me to go somewhere else and to stop cutting the line. I explained that I went to the bathroom and came back to my original place, so I didn't steal it from anyone. He told me he didn't care. I didn't care either and didn't want to fuel a fight, so I ignored him. He started etting angry and shouted at me. He pushed and grabed me by my collar. I was surprised he did that, as the power dynamic was clearly in my favour. He was about a head smaller than me, out of shape, and I'm quite athletic. I grab him by his (he still had my collar in hand), put my forehead on his and told him to back off. This guy starts stuttering, as he was clearly not ready for someone to fight back, but keeps insulting me. Tim, who's very uncomfortable with confrontation, screamed at me and told us to stop. We both did. I thought about it for a few minutes and understood why they'd be pissed, so I apologised and explained that they were right, and I was the asshole. He and his girlfriend (who he was probably trying to impress) accepted the apology. 

After the concert (it was great), the boys and I joked about it and Tim admitted he was glad I told the guy off, as he'd probably be a pain in the ass to deal with if I stayed passive.

bwoazz	2019-06-04 12:48:15		AITA for asking my landlord to remove a plant that attracts ticks	"Our apartment has a great backyard and this yard is one of the biggest reasons we are staying in a 2 bedroom apartment with a second kid on the way.   


A few weeks back my husband was doing some yard work and he got a tick on him that we didn't find for quite a few days and I had to remove it. For whatever reason this incident gave me a ton of anxiety, probably because I'm pregnant, but also just because I'm a mom who has a young daughter who plays in that backyard all of the time. A day or two later an article popped up on my newsfeed about how a certain bush can attract lyme disease carrying ticks and we have two of these bushes in our backyard. I have always hated these bushes because they are covered in huge sharp thorns, and they are also an invasive species which is really bad for our native plants. The article states these plants increase the risk of disease carrying ticks on any property and that the state's CDC recommends they be removed. The article also said these plants are now not even legal to buy in our state anymore because of their invasive nature.   


I asked our landlord if they would remove them, and even offered to do it ourselves and explained the article and the CDC's recommendations. They didn't answer for over a week, and at this point our lawn still hasn't been mowed (this is included in our lease) which can also increase ticks. So I asked again last night and mentioned the lawn hadn't been done. He said he'd check on the lawn but that we weren't ""ripping up the yard"" because these bushes wouldn't make a difference because ticks come in on animals, and that we get the same tick warning every year and we need to treat the perimeter which means mowing the grass. Now, I will admit this made me a little mad. I had already explained to him I had read this in the paper and the CDC was recommending it, and I felt like he was just dismissing me like some paranoid idiot housewife who couldn't know anything about lawncare or tick prevention. I reminded him again that the CDC recommended this, and that studies had shown those particular bushes certainly can make a difference regarding the number of ticks on a property and actually attract ticks and sent him the article. I also offered to replace the bushes with a different plant on my own dime since it seems like it's possibly an aesthetic concern. I feel like offering to replant something new was a very reasonable compromise but now he is just not responding to me, and my husband thinks I was too pushy.

Wife got a temporal gig in Europe, and she is getting a decent fee for this, plus some rent money, all of these on top of her normal monthly income.  So all in all, low ball, for the coming months she will be making 3x of what I do at the moment.

Her company got a flat, but alas, just for one person, so person number two, that is me, needs to pay a very basic extra amount - say $600 for three months. She wants me to pay that, which economically is not really an issue.

Thing is that in the past I have had similar opportunities overseas, and renting a flat or paying a hotel was never something I asked her to contribute to it. At all. So in a way I feel like I need to pay my way in. AITA if I refuse to pay, even is small money?"	Asshole	0	0

I’m a supervisor for some boring office temp job. (Recently graduated to I’m trying to earn some money before I start my grad scheme in September).

There is a kitchen in this office but the temp staff aren’t allowed to use it (even though it specified in our contract that we would have access to all facilities). This girl came to me during the first week (2 weeks ago) and said it was crap that we don’t have access to the kitchen; she said that she was taking medication and that she couldn’t just buy any old food to eat for lunch like the sandwiches in the nearby shop (I assumed that meant she has allergies or food intolerances). She wanted to be able to microwave food that she brings in so I offered to request the lead manager make an exception. He said it was fine as long as I was happy to do it for her.

Fast forward to last week and I find out the “medication” she was on was Lemsip (basically paracetamol) and vitamin D tablets, and that she only took the Lemsip for two days... she also occasionally has been bringing in food bought from the shop.

I’m pissed that she kinda lied to me and I don’t like pandering to manipulative people. However, this job is finishing in a weeks time.

So should I tell her I know she mislead me and that I can’t microwave her food for her anymore because it’s special treatment and I can’t do it for everyone? Or should I just put up with it since it’s only one more week and avoid the confrontation?

We've always had a fun  friendship & been close despite our respective weirdnesses (me  ASD, her super ADHD) & have had a historically good dialogue &  mutual respect for each other, despite the relationship being somewhat  biased but we balanced really well and it never seemed too hugely  problematic.

I have my sh!t \*kinda\* together & have helped her countless times over the years- she was chaos but over recent years has been diagnosed & sorted all of her main  issues out & is genuinely working on the rest & has turned in to a  proper adult. We're sort of like an old married couple, joke that each is our 'wife'  etc. We're family and then some.

So we I go on holiday (her idea, started off as a great  but  impulsive idea that ends up costing me a small fortune (again  due to her carelessness/lack of consideration etc) but whatever, it'll  all be great when we get there right?!

Final night it all goes wrong.  I'd managed her chaos as best I could, communicated well but on the final night, trying to sleep for 3/4+hours,  I had a  panic attack that lead to a full meltdown so I sat in hostel bar until we check out  & I tell her I'm going to head to airport & await flight as I can't deal with the overload of city we're in& I didn't want to ruin her last day.  She joins later, explained I was drained and couldn't think or communicate properly, we boarded and had an OK flight home.

We arrive I miss something said,she was getting stressy, kept walking off, I asked to stop, don't walk off & tell me what  but she snapped, shouted & was  really mean & rude so I told her that she didn't need to be a dick (We speak like  this all time,both frank  Northerners) & went to await the coach we were  taking to mine.She ignores me whole journey -  messaged my partner & got him to take her spare meds from ours across the city in the middle of the night to  her SIL's, then stays on coach to her city, not informing me of this plan change. I get home really distressed then find out what  she made him do & she ignores me for months.

10months later and I get a text, v  apologetic ""I was a dick, shit friend etc "" & it  threw me.  I wrote a careful reply thanking for apology &  explained that I had too much going on at the mo, needed to focus on me I'd be in touch, signed off with love and  kisses etc. Since then  I've become more conflicted over what to do. I love her but  it's all so one-sided, emotionally draining & she has no time for my needs & I just don't think we can be the same.

Before I left I forgot to put gas in said car. We share two cars, one is really nice and the other I am pretty scared of since it’s a little over 30 years old, I call it the death trap. I told her “I am driving this car this morning.” And she blew up, saying that she was the one who filled up the car so she should get to drive it, asked if I had put any gas in the death trap (which I have). The problem is is I’ve filled up the car several time too and had no problem with letting her drive it since it’s both of ours. I argued with her, called her a b*tch, then ended up taking the death trap to school. I am actually pretty angry about this, I screamed for the majority of the way to school, if I didn’t do this then I would have curb stomped her. Am I the asshole?

bwo7w5	2019-06-04 12:38:35		AITA for cutting off my friend for not shutting up about her boy problems?	"So I have a friend that I’ve known for about 8 years now (since the beginning of HS). She had a boyfriend for a while who I became quite close with because of her. After 3ish years of them being together they broke up, although it took several months to “confirm” the break up. 

So following their initial stage of breaking up, my friend starts seeing a male friend of mine who we shall call C. They started sleeping together and what not, however her breakup with her ex was apparently not official. We’ll call her ex O. Despite the many complaints about him, she still spoke to him as he kept saying he still liked her. Which is fair enough, but I wasn’t that impressed that she was sleeping with C and, in my POV, leading him on while still talking to O. I was very upfront about my POV when she asked.

So eventually it came to a point where she’d randomly start crying when we hung out because she didn’t know which guy to be with. Call me insensitive but I thought it was a bit ridiculous. C did not know O was still a thing until he went through her phone one day. Anyway the problems with these two guys went on for about 6 months and I kind of got over it after a while as I personally thought there were better things to worry about. 

It kind of came to a boiling point one day where I had been running on very low sleep as I sometimes start work at 5am, but on other days would work a night shift. On this day I had forgotten a week prior that I had agreed to go to dinner for her younger brother’s birthday, whom I am not that close with. I told her I’d probably bail as I was very tired. She was disappointed and wouldn’t stop going on about buying an outfit for the dinner (only she, I, the brother and brother’s girlfriend who I don’t know would be attending). She asked me a place where she could get a cheap but decent dress, and I suggested supre. She scoffed at this and then proceeded to talk about nice dresses worth around $200. I then snapped at her for being a judgy bitch and that she shouldn’t have asked if she wasn’t going to consider an actual place with decent but cheap clothes. 

Anyway after this we didn’t really talk for the rest of the day. I decided she wasn’t really worth hanging around with if she was the type of friend to force me to attend a very unimportant dinner rather than let me rest after working. I was also pretty sick of hearing about the guy problems. Personally I thought it was alright for a while, but I grew sick and tired of it until it became a daily thing and didn’t stop for months. 

So AITA for not sticking around and listening? We barely talk nowadays since all that happened but we haven’t shunned each other. Sorry for the length."		1	0

So my boyfriend (let’s call him Jon) and I have been having major issues with our apartment (carbon monoxide leak from the furnace, igniters not working on the stove, etc) that have been going on for months now. His dad expressed to Jon that he would love for us to move into his house because he is always out of town and is afraid someone will break in. Jon and I have a serious talk and decided we were legally allowed to break the lease (unsafe conditions) so we would give our 30 day notice the next time we pay rent.
Well, yesterday was that day. I give the notice and we leave. I feel a huge weight off my shoulders, no more shitty apartment! Jon goes to his dad’s house because the locks were getting changed and the guys doing it would be there soon. Cool! Long story short, I looked up one of the guys on FB and find out that Jon’s dad has a go fund me set up for turning his house into basically a shelter for disabled veterans. I was beside myself to say the least.
Should probably mention that I have severe PTSD from living with roommates/strangers previously, which my bf is well aware of. My mental state has not been okay since I found out I could potentially be reliving a nightmare all over again with people who might not even actually be veterans (his dad is not the type to do his research).
I asked Jon when he planned on telling me what his dad wanted to do with the home, and he said he didn’t think his dad was serious. After speaking with his dad and voicing concern for his safety and mine, his dad’s exact words were: “Buy a gun if you’re worried about safety.”
His dad thinks I’m basically heartless because I don’t want to help the veterans and my boyfriend just says it’s his dad’s house so his rules. AITA?

Edit: Friendly reminder that people other than veterans can have PTSD. I would rather not go into detail about previous roommate situations, but I can assure you it was more than “they didn’t take out the trash”."	No A-holes here	0	0
bwo4u5	2019-06-04 12:29:13	DeathOfaScamArtist	WIBTA if I didn’t cite my moms resources for her?	"My mom recently went back to school to get her masters. She has been very stressed out and overwhelmed since starting school again, so much so that she went to a psychiatrist for the first two semesters to help her manage the stress. She is much better now, but still gets overwhelmed because she has a full time job and still cooks/cleans for my dad. 

Right now she is taking a research class. She has to write two big papers this semester, all in APA format. I know APA can be confusing and a pain in the ass sometimes so I helped her out and showed her the format, sent her examples of some APA style papers I’ve written, gave her an APA manual, showed her how to use the Purdue Owl website, and showed her a website that cites everything for you. I walked her through APA format for her first paper, including how to cite all the resources. 

Today, she gives me this stack of books and articles and tells me (not verbatim) “Can you cite these for me by Thursday? Type them up and email it to me.” 

I was a little taken aback when she asked me that. I don’t know why but I just feel uncomfortable about doing her work for her, especially after I took all that time to show her how to do it. I asked my dad if i would potentially be out of line for bringing that up to her. He said that I’m just being lazy and selfish and that “she’s your mother and you’ve seen how stressed she has been”.

bwo4k8	2019-06-04 12:28:20		AITA for making my Ex take her rats home after she broke up with me	"Broke up last week.

Bought rats a while back, we agreed if anything happened between us she would take the rats home. Her mother is refusing to accept the rats.

We have a bit of a situation with rats. The pet shop we got them from mis-sexed one of the rats which resulted in 2 more rats, my ex accidentaly rehomed a female one thinking it was male which ended up getting pregnant again and had SEVEN-FUCKING-TEEN babies. My Ex didn't want to give them to a pet shop so she was going to wait until they were old enough to seperate and then rehome them. She has already found a lot of people on facebok groups willing to accept them, however it will be 7 more weeks before this is possible.

&#x200B;

The baby rats and mother have been seperated into a different cage to prevent other rats in the cage from stealing babies (they do this for some reason). I told her that I'd like her to take the baby rats home and explain to her mother that it's only temporary until they are rehomed.

She was under the impression that she would still be able to come round to my house ever 1-3 days to check on them and rehome them from my house. I'm completely refusing this to happen because I don't want her coming into my house after we have broken up.

&#x200B;

I've told her to explain to her mother the situation and to take them home and under no circumstances is she going to keep popping into my house to rehome them.

&#x200B;

She wanted the rats, she bought the rats, she agreed to take them home if anything happened, she mis-sexed them reuslting in 17 more rats. As far as I'm concerned, it's her responsibility and I'm taking no part in this."	Not the A-hole	1	0

My investments will also mature in a few years in which I can expect to be decently wealthy. I’m saying this to emphasize that in an event of a divorce, I have a lot to lose. 

I have told my fiancé several times that I will not marry without some sort of protection or guarantee for my financial future. At the time she agreed, but now I think she simply said whatever it took at the time to get me onboard with marriage. She probably didn’t think I was serious but I certainly was and am. 

I talked this over with my lawyer and he drafted what I consider to be a pretty ironclad prenuptial agreement based on my concerns. He even suggested adding an infidelity clause which I didn’t think of, but certainly welcomed the suggestion. 

I talked this over with my fiancé and told her to go over the prenup with her lawyer to see if we can reach mutually agreeable terms. She got VERY offended that I even felt the necessity for one. To say she got upset would be an understatement. She was particularly offended by the infidelity clause. I certainly did not expect this reaction from her. She is now insisting that she will sign no prenups. 

Her reaction is making me have second thoughts. She claims that I’m not respecting our relationship and I’m expecting it to fail, which is not true. However, life is unpredictable and anything can happen at anytime so I’m just trying to protect my financial future in case of a divorce. 

I’m beginning to question everything after her response, especially to the infidelity clause. I thought we had a good relationship and never questioned her loyalty before, but why should she get so offended if there is nothing to hide ? It really feels like she would prefer to take me to the cleaners in the event of a divorce.

Keep in my mind, most of the terms in the prenup, including the infidelity clause also applies to me. She is more than welcome to modify it because I’m faithful and have nothing to hide. But at this point I’m planning on just calling the whole thing off.

During the dating period and through the engagement, now ex-wife was a very heavy drinker, drank minimum of a 6-pack a night (she was pretty tiny, only 5'3""). Not only was it expensive, that kind of drinking at such a young age (early 20s) with no sign of slowing down, even after a DUI, was dangerous. She agreed that the drinking needed to back off and she promised after the wedding she would. Well, after a very expensive wedding her parents paid for, she didn't change at all. After about 6 months, I finally confronted her about it, brought up her promise and she agreed she would restrict her drinking to weekends. Well, that lasted about two weeks. One weeknight she went out after work with some coworkers and I fully expected her to have a beer or two, and I didn't mind. She had learned her lesson about drinking and driving, so she never had more than 2 when she had to drive and even then made sure enough time passed for it to not be in her system. When she got home, I went for a kiss and she actively pulled away and tried to hide her breath from me. I was angry about her trying to hide something from me, not the drinking, and I told her as much. She promised, yet again, that she'll slow down, but she never did. After about another 6 months of broken promises I decided to just end it. She said I was an asshole for letting her parents pay for such an expensive wedding just to divorce me, but I couldn't handle being lied to anymore. So, AITA?

I’ve had my head shaven(when I say shaven, i mean 1mm, not baby’s bottom smooth) multiple times these past 2 years. Of course, I accepted, because he told me he is going to cut my hair “short” beforehand.

Around Easter, while we were on holiday, he put up a new rule: one bad grade, he’ll take away my new laptop. If I take a second bad grade, he’ll send me to have my head shaven. 

Well, I did take a bad grade. After I told him about it, he told me that he was going to take my laptop, and send me to the barber. I didn’t take it well, but I thought he was joking. When I went to the barber, he told me that my dad was serious about shaving my head. So I told the barber to keep 4cm on top.

When I went home, my dad was not happy(I expected it) and he didn’t feed me for the last 24 hours. Luckily, I have some money of my own, so I can handle that for the next 2 weeks, until I go back to my hometown.

From my point of view, he is a hypocrite. He broke a rule made by him, gor reasons unknown to me. So, am I the asshole? Should I have not retaliated?

Edit: I will talk with him tomorrow, I had 2 nervous breakdowns, and he told me in a call that he would offer my laptop, as long as i get my head shaven, so he clearly has an obsession with my hair.

Edit 2: Ok so, I’ve talked to him yesterday. I might’ve not explained myself to him clearly enough, but I understand now why he won’t leave me any food in the last 50-ish hours. His reasons for being angry are pretty much that that I went to the barber and had a “normal” haircut, I didn’t let him know beforehand, and that I told him that I’ve lost some respect for him. That’s why he won’t make me food anymore, but he’ll leave me 15 RON(roughly 3€), basically to feed myself. He did give me some food though: he gave me dinner, and a cheap cheesecake from a supermarket(which, I have to say, is pretty good). He told me that he’ll think about another punishment(very ominous), and that’s pretty much it. This whole fucking thing, he’s made all of these decisions these past days for a fucking haircut.

bwnz0a	2019-06-04 12:10:36	microfatcat	AITA for not wanting to change the hen party plans?	"**General background:**

* Hen guest list: Bride, me (maid of honour), Annoying Bridesmaid 1, Annoying Bridesmaid 2, and her mother. 

* I got married 4 years ago and my hen party was horrendous, it involved bitching in the loos by Annoying Bridesmaids 1 and 2, and they were in tears over literally nothing (they were drunk and tired). 



**Background to current situation:**

* I'm made of honour. Bridesmaids = the same group as above. 

* Bride wants me to plan her hen party, wants no input into it, trusts me to plan something fun, no alcohol
 
* She mentioned this to me after Annoying Bridesmaids 1 and 2 were messaging her party ideas (in a Facebook chat group I'm not in!) which was stressing her out. 

* My life is no longer drama filled since I stopped seeing them, so perhaps I'm not well-practiced at navigating these situations




**The situation:**

* I've planned a spa day and meal and a themed tea party / crafts afternoon on Day 2. No alcohol, over 2 days, requested by Bride due to drama at my hen and the baby 

*  Annoying Bridesmaid 1 who has an 18 month old son says she likely won't come to the spa day because baby won't go to sleep unless he's sleeping on her, and is breastfeeding. I don't think she is being unreasonable.

* Annoying Bridesmaid 2 says that I should've made a group conversation because we now 'need to decide what we should all do for the hen party' i.e. make a whole new plan. 

* My husband's advice is that if people don't want to come to certain parts, that's their decision. It's not a democracy and the whole group doesn't decide together what to do.

* Although this makes sense, I'm concerned this will lead to more drama. Bride says she wants everyone to have fun and not be upset. 

* Am I being a cow for wanting to keep the plan as it is?

Now after a while of her getting accustomed to the fact that we're married and have a baby on the way, she now seems to share the excitement and I'm very happy about that. We've talked about her visiting us overseas when the baby's born. 

&#x200B;

Now we recently brought up the topic that she can't stay as a houseguest with us. We did point out that we'd love to have her here and spend time with her, but she can't sleep at our place. We offered to help look for accomodation in our area (there's holiday home here close by). My own mother offered to come visit around the same time as her, so they could share an appartment and split the costs. 

Our main reasons for this are that we don't want her (or any other houseguest, for that matter) while we're having a newborn for the first time, and also that we don't have the space. The former guest room is now the nursery, where the baby's things, clothes and changing table is. We also consider it too stressful to have a stranger in our intimate family space right after the baby's born. We're uncertain how hard it will be (sleep deprevation, hormonal changes) and a house guest would certainly add to the stress level massively. Especially since the relationships are not super close to our mothers.  
My own mother also reacted slightly hurt by the fact she can't sleep on our couch when I told her, but she took it much better than my MIL.

bwnye2	2019-06-04 12:08:40		AITA for not wanting to watch TV that stresses me out even if it’s TV my BF loves?	"My [29F] BF [30M] is a big fan of all things TV and movies - One of his favorite pastimes is seeking out new movies to love and he has so many favorites it’s become a running joke. I like some TV, but I have pretty bad general anxiety so I don’t like watching anything that triggers it; basically I enjoy happy, silly TV and movies. But I feel like lately it’s become a point of contention in our long-term relationship that I won’t watch the things he loves to watch: dramas, thrillers, horror, etc.

Last night for the probably 10th time he asked if I would watch Black Mirror. I told him I didn’t want to. He got annoyed and said he would pick out one of the episodes that would be more my style. After back and forth I reluctantly agreed because honestly, I just didn’t want to escalate to a silly fight. We start the episode, 20 minutes in I am too stressed and tell him I’m just not that into it and I’m sorry. 

He gets very annoyed and tells me for the millionth time that I don’t even try to watch what he likes, and then gets upset / cold shoulders me for the rest of the night. And while I am describing the events from one evening, this is absolutely NOT an isolated incident. No matter how many times I tell him I don’t want to watch those things, he still continues to ask and then still continues to get frustrated with me when I don’t enjoy them. 

I hate that he takes it as a personal affront when I don’t like something he loves and I can absolutely see where he is coming from - he wants to share those things he loves with me. But I also feel like I am entitled to spend my limited free entertainment time not battling anxiety. So, AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	1	0

bwny60	2019-06-04 12:08:01		WIBTA if I told my new housemate I would be taking the larger room?	"It sounds like a small issue, but I'll give you some background and let you decide. Together me and my housemate share a two bedroom apartment, she has the larger room, and I, for a year now, have had the smaller room. 

Recently she's decided to move out, and promised one of our mutual friends her room. I hadn't realised that this had been promised and started getting ready to move into the larger room. This is where the problem arises. 

Both myself and the mutual friend have expressed our want for the larger room. I feel I have precedence as I have been living in the house for some time, and there's usually been a big room shuffle when someone leaves. Our mutual friend feels she deserves the room because my current housemate had offered it to her, and she has already turned down other properties for this one. I feel that my current housemate does not have control over the rooms once she moves out, and should not have offered it. 

Finally, we have been discussing this. She has made it clear that she does not want the smaller room stating that she has too many clothes. WIBTA if I tell her straight up that I was going to take the room? 

Failing this, I'll start to look for a new apartment because my king size bed and desk setup take-up too much floor space in the smaller room.

"We planned my graduation in January and I applied for an extra ticket so my best friend could come to it, since she said she wanted to go. We were also going to get massages that day too and I was really looking forward to it. 

Two weeks before my graduation, my friend says she can’t go because there is a meeting at work that she has to take minutes for. It got rescheduled to the day of my graduation.

I am devastated. These meetings are every month and are 3 hours long and they are always a complete time waster because people go on long unrelated tangents and it just seems like a dumb reason to not go to my graduation. I’ve already had other family pull out so I was really looking forward to my friend going. I asked if just for one day someone else could take minutes and she didn’t answer. 

So AITA?"		1	0
bwnwk3	2019-06-04 12:02:53	Simmerdi	AITA for telling my sister that I will always see her as a sister and never a mother?	"I'm 21 and my older sister is 35. I was raised as her little brother since birth. Two years ago I found out that my sister is actually my biological mother and that my parents who raised me are biologically my grandparents. It was a shock to me but I've had two years to process this information and I think I've come to terms with it. I still consider my grandparents as my parents. I was raised by loving and caring parents and never had to want for anything. I love them dearly. 

On the other hand my sister and I had a very difficult relationship growing up especially during my teenage years. I felt that she was extremely overbearing and overprotective. Even though my parents allowed me to go out with friends and gave me a curfew (11pm) my sister would often call and demand to know where I was, what I was doing, who I'm hanging out with etc. She tried to stop me from doing things she thought were too dangerous. She tried to stop me from swimming in our condo swimming pool because there was no life guard there despite the fact that the pool is tiny and not very deep. She also secretly asked her boyfriend to tail me and my friends when we went cycling at the beach because she was afraid I would drown in the ocean. I was 17 at the time. Me and my friends were cycling and I turned around and saw her boyfriend casually following us on a rented bicycle. It spoiled my mood and ruined the outing. At the time I thought she was just being a weird, overprotective sister. My friends all thought she was really weird. None of their older sisters behaved this way. But now it all makes sense. 

Since she revealed to me the truth about my adoption she thinks she can transition into a more parental figure in my life. I am really uncomfortable with that. I was raised for many years as her brother. It's just strange to see her as a parental figure after so many years. She made an emotional post on facebook about how she finally told her ""son"" the truth and ""reconnected with him"" as a mother. I didn't say anything at the time but was very uncomfortable with it. Yesterday she reintroduced me to a family friend as her ""long lost son"" in front of my mother/grandmother. I was pissed and said out loud that she is my sister and will always be my sister. She's not my mother and will never be my mother. I can't explain why I was so angry. But I was really furious. She burst into tears and left the room. Didn't come out for the rest of the night. My parents haven't said anything to me directly but the family friend thinks I was too harsh and that she was ""just joking"". I haven't spoken to my sister since yesterday night.

I put up with this for the first few times and even asked him why he doesn’t and he said i quote “i dont have to if i dont want to” .

bwns0c	2019-06-04 11:48:38	n00berduper	AITA for wanting to split monthly bills with s/o as they come in rather then paying a set monthly amount?	"We've been together for almost 2 years and we're renting an apartment together.  All of the bills are all in his name except the gas which has both our names on it).  He wants me to pay him a set monthly amount each month saying it will work out even in the long run (winter is more expensive than spring, etc).  I want to pay 50% of each bill as they come in.  I have no money issues so that's not a factor in his reasoning.  When I asked him why he wanted to collect a set monthly amount he replied he ""needs to budget for a certain amount"".

This is a major issue in our relationship and neither one of us are budging. We can both be really stubborn, but I don't think I'm the asshole this time. I'm feeling more like he's wanting an interest free loan to have extra money over the summer.  AITA?

bwnrog	2019-06-04 11:47:28	Random_Expletive	AITA for not accepting I’m responsible for my boyfriends academic failure?	"Crucial information here is we both suffer from depression and have been seeing each other for just over 8 months. 

So my boyfriend and I both study full time. At the beginning of this year he stressed to me that it was going to be a big year for him and he needed me to respect that. It’s my final year of my honours degree so I agreed that work would have to take priority.

He’s always offered me an open door when I’m feeling down and I’ve often taken him up on it. There have been times that I’ve just gone to his house and spent time in the same space as him for support. He’s always maintained this is ok, but now he’s turning around and saying this time I spent with him has ruined his academic process for the year and he has no work to show (he’s a digital illustrator) 

He maintains that because of the stress of the relationship, and me not understanding when he needed space, that he hasn’t been able to complete his work.

There is part of me that understands my responsibility: I should have been more proactive giving him the time and space he needed to work however I am 100% NOT responsible for him sleeping all day, playing games, going out, getting distracted by movies and telling me “yes absolutely you can come over” and then turning around when he has a deadline and telling me I stopped him getting his work in on time.

All year I’ve kept up a constant stream of communication with him about the space he needs and whether or not it’s ok for me to come over and he’s never really been upfront about whether or not he doesn’t actually want me there. He has a nasty habit of saying yes when he means no.

Also I find it frustrating that when I point out his lack of effort on his part, he just defaults back to “The stress of the relationship” causing the issues

He’s been given MULTIPLE opportunities to go into remission and get the work done. His lecturers have been really understanding but he still hasn’t done it. The responsibility of this then falls squarely on my shoulders. 

It’s at the point where if I talk about any academic success of mine he gets sulky and resentful that I’m passing and he isn’t. It’s really hurtful to me and I refuse to accept responsibility for his academic failure. I can understand how I added to his stress but in the end it’s in his shoulders. And over the last 3 months I’ve tried extra hard to make sure I’m not in the way. 

I’ve been stressed too this year and I haven’t failed my semester. I feel like I’m the scapegoat here and I refuse to take responsibility (more than I already have) for his academic struggles. 

So AITA here? Have I actually had more of a direct responsibility for his failure than I’m willing to admit?

bwnpc2	2019-06-04 11:39:57	Nipples4Jesus	AITA for blocking/ignoring family in 3rd world country and refusing to give away money?	"Hello all. 

I have family in the Philippines that live in run down areas of the country. They can barely afford medication for sick family members and can't afford clothing. My parents gives them a hefty amount of money every month for their basic needs. However, I have cousins who I barely know message me on Facebook asking for more money because of unexpected emergencies. I also have family who message me asking me to find them romantic partners in the U.S. so it'd be easier to immigrate here.
I am a full time student who is currently paying off student debt, struggling to keep a roof over my head as it is, but I do have a couple thousand saved incase of emergencies. I block and remove all of my cousins because all they ask for is money and a romantic interest to propose to, which I want nothing to do with.
They also see the clothes I'm wearing through my Facebook photos and ask to send them over. I've sent old clothes that I no longer wear in the past, but they continue to ask for more.

I spoke to my mother about my family and she tells me I'm selfish for having this extra money and not giving it to my family. She goes on about how I have aunts and uncles with cancer and medical needs are expensive. This makes me feel guilty knowing they have less than me and I have sick relatives, but I don't want to be put in a vulnerable position because I don't have extra funds.

I'm the only one who still has an old laptop that can access it, so I'm putting everything onto a new hard drive.

I'm having to go into folders as some won't transfer as a whole and there are some corrupt files I need to avoid. This is how I came across a document in one of my brothers folders with what I recognised as my best friends email. Curiosity got the better of me and I opened it.

This chat is almost 10 years old and I havent seen my former best friend in about 9 years, so reading it didnt feel as much of a violation as if we were still friends, and I wouldn't say I had a close relationship with my brother either. It was just really interesting to read and find out they had a thing going on, which I had suspected back then.

Reading this hasn't changed anything and no one will know I've ever seen it, but even so I think I know I'm the asshole. In fact I'm terrified/embarrassed by the idea of someone reading certain chats. I think my nosiness is the reason I have trust issues and anxiety haha.

bwnm3i	2019-06-04 11:29:16	jgustav86	AITA for feeling relief after my gf’s miscarriage?	"Me and my gf have been together for two years. The relationship have had its ups and downs and I am not sure I want to be with her in the long run.

She was supposedly on the pill, though now I suspect that maybe she was not. However I cannot prove it, though I found suspect that she told me after the miscarriage “I was so happy... we were finally moving in together. Now there’s nothing left to plan”. She seemed mostly sad about us not moving in together (though also for not having a baby). 

She desperately wants me to move in with her and I still don’t want to. Of course I would have to move in with her if she was still pregnant.

So this is what happened. Last week she told me she was late. We waited 3 more days and she took a pee test. Positive. I told her she should also have a blood text next day which was also positive. I told her I would stick with her because she was talking about a baby since one year ago and I knew she would never have an abortion, so I didn’t even considered it a real option and assumed that a baby was welcome if already on its way. But I was very scared, not properly excited about it and I was afraid that I would be unhappy because I have a feeling we won’t stay together on the long run and I don’t want kids with her. But I felt I had no other option since she really wanted the pregnancy. I would take responsibility and do the best I could.

The next day, she miscarried. She was devastated. I was not exactly devastated, though I felt sad. Sad about the situation, not exactly for the fact that she was not pregnant anymore. Sad because she was going through the entire morbid physical process. Sad because... I realized I actually WANTED that to happen. I never mentioned abortion to her and I really was going to stick to her, even against my own wishes because I didn’t want her to get pregnant in the first place. And finally... I felt relief. Of course I am still shocked, and still a bit sad (though I really didn’t want this pregnancy to evolve), but mostly relieved. Of course I am supporting her in all ways I can, took some days off work to be there for her because it is also my responsibility that she’s going through this. But I do not regret that she miscarried... though it makes me sad.

AITA for feeling relief? AITA for not feeling the need to mourn? Is it ridiculous that I feel sad about feeling relief?

I work for my colleges newspaper and there's this one co-worker who I feel is either leaving me out of situations or just doesn't think to include me.

For context: my phone's camera does not work and therefore I cannot take pictures using SnapChat. I'm on a plan with my parents and cannot get a new phone at this time. My problem is that this co-worker only invites people to hang out via Snapchat. And like I know you can create a Snapchat and not take pictures of it but my other problem is that he only invites people who are active with it. This wouldn't be a problem so much but he invites everybody from the newspaper except three of us and there are about 20 of us in total I don't know if maybe I should just take the hint that he doesn't like us or what but it really feels like he's not including us on purpose because we either don't have Snapchat or for whatever reason and I've brought it up to him in the past and he just shrugs it off and says get a new phone. I know it probably sounds childish but when you're being not included it kinda makes you feel bad.

But i am always mindful to make sure my long legs dont bump into the seat ahead of me, and i NEVER lean my seat back unless it an empty seat or a small child right behind me.

Once on a flight, after the attendant walks by, but before we are technically “allowed” to lean back, the guy ahead of me aggressively leans back and jams into my knees. Im mildly annoyed, but i let it go, bc i figure he will have it leaned back the whole flight, so whats another 20 minutes. 3 hours later, the pilot announces “seats upright, trays back, etc.” and as the attendant is checking on people the guy ahead puts his seat up. Finally i have a tiny amount of leg room, and i adjust my position accordingly. As soon as the attendant passes by him, he jams his seat back and into my knees. At this point im pissed, so i just start bouncing my knees aggressively. After about a minute he turns and tells me to “stop bouncing my fucking knee”, and i reply “oh im sorry, landings make me nervous, but i think your seat is supposed to be up any ways”.

In the last few weeks we had many stupid arguments and we've decided to take a break from eachother for a while. One of my closest friends, I m going to call her Anne started to hang out with him more and more saying that she feels bad for him and what not. In the meantime she would also hang out with me telling me how sorry she is for him, because he feels terrible for what happened. Few days later me and my bf decide to go out for a bit and he tells me that Anne admitted to liking him a few days before we got together and that she felt bad for rejecting him a few years ago. I was like ooook, that doesn't sound good and I ve warned him that she might still have a crush on him. He started thinking about it and so he messaged her that night and asked her if she liked him. She answered yes and asked if he liked her back. Apparently she was drunk (although she specified that night that she wasn't) and she called him the next day to talk about it.
They met up and she started to tell him how she only meant that she liked him as a friend and that he is a nice person and bla bla bla.
Now, I ve confronted her about it and she denies having any feelings for him and considers me crazy for thinking so. Another thing that came into my mind after hearing all these things was when she first found out we were together she told me that I ve made a big mistake and that I should ve remained just friends with him.

Originally it was supposed to be I explained the maths and she explains the application, but she's been busy with work for other classes and so I just asked her to write 100-200 words on why it's important to be able to predict population growth and jobs where this would be useful. It's the night before and I've pretty much finished the entire poster, including the bit I gave her just in case she doesn't get it to me in time. I'm tempted to hand it in and tell the teacher that she didn't contribute but I'd feel bad if she got a 0 cuz we're friends, like not close but we talk a bit. Maybe she could try and get an extention or something idk, but WIBTA if I do that tomorrow?

TLDR: My partner didn't do the work but if I hand it in like that she'll get a 0

bwndn1	2019-06-04 10:59:57		AITA Am I selfish for blocking him?	"Okay over a year ago I made friends with this guy I will call Fred. Fred seemed pretty cool at first and we got along really well but he started to get really attached to me. He would call me every day and send me texts all the time and would get angry with me if I was too busy to talk. I'm a University student and so I am often occupied with assignments. Fred had a habit of calling asking if I wanted to hang out and if I apologised saying I was busy he would guilt trip me until I came over claiming I only ever thought of myself.

Because of stress I would often feel really depressed and he would often accuse me of crying at the top of the hat even though he often called me crying over minor things. He even got angry at me for taking time to mourn when my mother died because I wasn't thinking about him. 

He would often buy me really expensive things that made me feel guilty for how much it cost but then demanded that I pay him back. He told me once that he had a crush on me despite being straight (I'm a man) and ever since I let him down (I'm gay but only saw him as a friend), he's get angry at me for showing interest in other guys saying he was giving up so much for me and calling me vain and shallow. He kept me from seeing my friends and shouted at me if I put my family first saying he should be more important.

He would also start conversations with out of context statements and when I was confused he would call me stupid or say things like ""Am I speaking in tongues?"" or ""It was pretty fucking clear"".

Recently I had enough when he kept saying that he was disgusting and call me stupid because I did not know how to help. After snapping at me and telling me to go fuck myself I finally blocked him. I ended up receiving a message from him through his friend's number apologising and saying he was sorry. Am I a bad person for not wanting to talk to him again? I feel kind of guilty about it."		1	0
bwndmb	2019-06-04 10:59:52		AITA for going of at a guy for misgendering me when he claimed it was an accident when I think it wasn't	"So I'm a transgender male. I would just like to clarify that I'm not an SJW and I don't normally freak out at people for misgendering me unless I feel that it was on purpose and they know I'm trans. I am out to my parents and most of my friends, and I'm pre transition and I currently go by a name when around friends and my household that sounds somewhat gender neutral that's close enough to my birth name to come off as a nickname. 

Anyway me and C were having an argument about a thing and at the very end he referred to me by my birth name. Now at first assuming he probably forgot or something, I asked him to call me by my actual name that I go by, but he just said 'NO! YOUR NAME IS BIRTHNAME'. 

Now, I have said many times and made it very clear what name I go by, and C has called me the right name multiple time. So we move to Instagram, and I tell him that what he said was offensive.

So, his first excuse was 'You haven't changed it legally so I can call you birthname', which is not how it works. On top of that I am not in a position to legally change my name. When I pointed this out he then changed his argument to 'I didn't know', which is very sketchy because if he didn't know he would have said that to begin with. There's also the fact that he has called me by the right name multiple times, so yes he did know. 

Once I pointed out that, yes, he did know, and that I literally had an account on one of our group chats that everyone, including him, knows is mine thats in my preferred name, he said he thought it was a joke. Now I have a few social issues. I struggle more than most people to understand social situations. Even I would know that when my TRANSGENDER friend says CAN YOU PLEASE CALL ME THIS NAME and that name doesn't sound like a joke name, that it's probably not a joke. 

That was his final excuse. I still found it hard to believe him, especially in the context of it happening in an argument. So AITA."	Not the A-hole	1	0
bwnd47	2019-06-04 10:58:01	GrannyFromChurch	AITA or rather IMDTA(Is My Dad The Asshole) for denying a homeless lady entry in his restaurant because she draws away customers.	So my father owns a small Jamaican and Mediterranean mixed restaurant in New Jersey. He’s had multiple customers who come in who are either homeless or pretend to be to get food like many other restaurants have.  There’s one out of the bunch that stands out though and that’s this woman with puffed up dirty greasy hair, she comes in with torn clothes and looks like she hasn’t taken a shower in weeks. She in a bad spot obviously and my Dads a Mormon so he strongly believes in helping others. She comes in everyday asks for food then leaves when the store isn’t open she heads to the Wendy’s next door to get food. It’s definitely possible she does crack,heroine etc being the most likely reason she’s not able to afford anything else due to her addictions. When me and my father went to the Wendy’s on this recent Memorial Day she was there as well. My father bought her the four for four deal and she proceeded to say inside where she was then told by one of the workers to leave. The homeless lady then called the worker a “whore”. My father didn’t exactly like that so he proceeded to follow her outside and tell her to not return to his restaurant and ask for food if she was going to talk to others like that. She then proceeded to curse my father saying “fuck you” “you piece of shit” etc. As she said this my father followed her until she was down the block he threatened to call the cops and that if she got any closer to him he would “beat the shit out of her”. This was just to scare her away which it accomplished and she has tried to return but not been allowed to enter and the cops have already been called on her once.

bwnavr	2019-06-04 10:49:35	Magpie213	AITA for wanting to have meal out with my future brother-inlaw?	"So basically, I am married already and my sister is engaged. We've all known each other since college where we all got together if you will.

I was happy for my sister and then boyfriend (now DH) to get along as it is important to me that both family and bfs/gfs be civil to each other. Plus my parents really liked him too so major bonus!

We all enjoyed going out together; days out, movies, food, shopping trips etc.

Thing is; I suffered severe depression and anxiety afew years ago but have managed to (mostly) beat it, thank god! At the time I was aware that DH was neglecting going out seeing friends and family just to stay in with me (as I just wanted to shut the whole world out at my worst point) so when my sister asked if she and DH could go out for a meal, I said yes because I didn't want to drag him down with me into the pits of despair. And they did, and they had a nice time and DH even said thankyou to me for letting him go even though he knew how badly I was suffering right then.

Not a problem! It took time; but with help I managed to get better and rejoin the world about 6 months later (yay!)

So now (2019) I think I would like to have just one meal out with my FBIL as my sister did with my DH to get to know him alot better as we have barely spent any time together, even at family get togethers, holidays and B-Days; we hardly have the chance to have a proper conversation at all. Plus it would be nice to know his interests better so we're not just buying him sweets and bodywash every b-day and holiday. But now my sister won't let me have that with him even though he seems genuinely up for it. Even my DH thinks it's a good idea as we never see him.

The last time I tried asking; she made up this crap about him being too tired or why couldn't we ALL go instead? Basically blocking me at every turn.

AITA for wanting to do this?

Edit; Heya guys! Thankyou to all who responded to this. I think most of you are right - I just need to talk to my sister about all this really. That's the main problem that I need to get in there and sort out. Thankyou again though, it has helped gather perspective on this while situation. And thankyou to Redditt for having this sub where I can ask ppl about this 😊"	No A-holes here	0	0
bwnamp	2019-06-04 10:48:35	furnituretaker	AITA for taking the furniture and ending the friendship with my roommate when i moved out?	"A friend and I moved into an apartment together and furnished it. We bought a couple used things with cash, but everything else we put on my card and reimbursed. The furniture and appliances we bought were to be split when we moved out. About eight months ago he came to me saying he needed help with that months half of rent, because he was feeling depressed and had to cut back work. I was a little upset because my budget is somewhat tight, but hes a friend so whatever. I never expected him to repay that. I treated it as a gift, but told him I didn't want to do this again, and don't like to give money or loans to friends or family. About 2-3 months ago I came back from work to an eviction proceedings notice to our apartment. When i asked him about it he said he wasn't able to pay the last two months and hadn't told me and was taking the notices because he was embarrassed. I got super mad and stormed off (not my finest) and crashed at a friends for a few days. I paid the rent so I didn't have to live in my car, and when I went back to the apartment informed him when in two months when our lease was up for renewal i would not be staying, and I expected him to repay me that last two months and the late fees.I told him I'd give him three months.

When the lease was just about over he still hadn't even started working more, and I knew he could barely afford this months half of rent, so there's literally no way I'm getting repaid. So I packed up my stuff, and moved out and I took all the shared furniture and appliances with me. I texted him and told him I'm going to hold this as collateral, and he got really angry and said I had no right to do that. After this he didn't speak to me until my ultimatum was up. When it was, he told me he couldn't pay because of health problems, he needed more time, but we should hang out and be friends again. I lost it and told him I didn't want to speak to him again, and told him he was a leech. Blocked him and moved on with my life. After that I sold or donated any of the stuff I didn't want. 

Now some mutual friends are saying I'm an asshole and need to give him the stuff back and be friends because they're worried about him, and if I don't we can't be friends. Honestly I don't really care anymore. I gave him a fair shot and it's not my fault if he wants to piss away a friendship through negligence, and if they really want to take a stand on this I don't think I'll back down. AITA?"

bwn9wo	2019-06-04 10:45:53	icedteawhore0614	AITA for getting angry that my ex best friend dragged my younger sister into an argument between the two of us or does ESH?

Shortening it down to get right to the point of what I need to know, as I definitely know I'm a huge asshole in the grand scheme of things)

Now, I'll put the backstory shortened down into bullet points because I can't be arsed typing it all out again. I don't want judgement on these series of events because I know we both sucked. This is really just needed to set a scene

• I (f16) in study period asking ""best friend"" (m16) about study period, I mentioned that going through buzzfeed isn't studying jokingly and the other girl I was with got angry at him and called it his piss around period. He normally comes out with rude comments like that too others, as he'd implied to someone that I ignored him to go fuck my boyfriend behind an alleyway the day before, so I didn't step in at all. He got angry, flipped out and left.
• I made a joke about it on my close friends story (in short, asshole move) but deleted it almost immediately. Unfortunately, he saw it and assumed I deleted it just because he'd seen it
• He confronted me over messages and chewed me out, I apologised and said I was in the wrong for joking about it online and apologised for offending him with my questions, that he happily answered until my friend jumped in with a snarky remark. He said I trivialised his recovery and belittled him, I apologised and tried to explain I didn't mean too, I was just curious about his study period as I'd forgotten the smaller details
• I make a couple of offers to sort this out over messages as I hadn't seen him irl at that point, which were ignored (which was fair enough)

Now the thing I'm angry about, the only thing is the fact that he had decided it was a good idea to confront my sister (f11) in the middle of McDonalds and ask her if I'd been talking shit about him at home. After about a week of no-contact, I'd decided to message him asking why he thought it was a good idea and how he'd feel if I'd done that to his younger brother. My parents at the point weren't happy that my sister had been dragged into it and threatened to go into the school. My parents told me that he and I can sort our own teenage shut out ourselves but they weren't happy he confronted and intimidated my sister in this. I chose to do damage control and wanted to ask him before I let my parents get involved. 

Fully expecting to get harsh judgements but I wanted to get strangers perspectives on the entire thing. I fully think I've been a bit of an asshole, but he genuinely thinks he's a saint in all of this and that genuinely bugs me. Overall, AITA or does ESH?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bwn8eo	2019-06-04 10:40:26	courtcourtcourtcourt	AITA and being misogynistic?	"I’m not sure so I would clarification please. 
So Im 19 and have OCD and have been for the past five years. Before then it was quite mild, but it really worsened then. One of the main factors was regarding the toilet. My older sister would never clean up after herself after using the toilet, and my family would have to come in and see her excrement and period blood in various places, like the toilet seat, floor, sink, taps etc. Since, I have stopped using the toilet at home and instead prefer to use the one at my girlfriends house. And when I do end up having to use it, I have to take a shower, which lasts about an hour (it was anywhere between 2.5- 3 hours but I manage to cut it down in the past 8 months). 

So while having breakfast this morning, the topic of my showers randomly comes up. Now sure how. My sisters says why do you have to take a shower so long, it’s so annoying. I then reply with ‘well I wouldn’t if you had cleaned up your poo and dirty period blood after using the toilet’. She gets furious. Says ‘that’s the problem with you men’ and says I am misogynistic. Was I in the wrong here? 

Don’t mean to cause any anger. I’m genuinely curious if I was in the wrong here. Cheers"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwn680	2019-06-04 10:32:08		AITA for telling the girl my friend dated i love her?	"One of my best friends started dating the girl i love for a long time. but i never told both that i loved her. me and my friend are going to rent a house together. 

so my friend told me he was going to date this girl. He told no one except me cause he trusted me. So he went on  their first date last Saturday and he told me it went very well. the next day he organised a BBQ in his home and after the BBQ we went partying, the girl was also their. During the party i showed affection to her (without intention) and that made her ask me if i loved her at the end of the party. I told her i loved her but that she needed to continue to date my friend. But she was very confused and left the party soon after. My friend didn't know what happened yet and he didn't know i loved her, i told her later that night after he insisted. 

Now the next day the girl made the decision to stop dating my friend and start dating me. My friend is now mad at me because i broke his trust, i get why he is mad. He isn't mad at the girl cause she was trown in this situation and accepted her choise, but is mad at me that i put her in this situation.

so now my friend don't know if he still want to life with me in one house in a few months, his parents are the owners of the house so if he wants he can block me from renting. His arguments are that i broke the bro code and had the worst timing, if i told her 2 weeks earlier there was no problem etc. He told me we can talk it out but the thrust he had in me is broken.

so am i the asshole for telling ""his"" girl and is he the asshole for not wanting to have me in his home?

At lunch, when it was supposed to happen, I didn’t come because 1. It was in the theatre which is on the other side of school and idk if they would let me in with foods and drinks (I had both) and I didn’t wanna walk all the way. 2. I was looking for my other friend so I can send him a video but I didn’t want to walk around everywhere so I just went to the ‘Retreat’ (where me and him usually hang out) and he wasn’t there, but I didn’t want to walk all the way back, as mentioned before.

While I was in there, my friend came back and said “You didn’t come to my performance.” And he said it with a bit of anger. I didn’t tell him that I just didn’t want to walk there, and kept silent and never really answered his questions. 

I was also sending him a funny video but I think he was taking his ‘revenge’ on me by ignoring it when I was playing it but idk if that’s just me being paranoid.

In short, we got into what ended in a hostile discussion over his study period (I was genuinely curious but he took it as belittling him because my friend accused him of having a piss around period) and he stormed out.

Out of bad taste, I made a joke about it on my close friends story on instagram. Five minutes later I felt guilty and took it down because I know I didn't think before posting. He'd seen it and assumed I took it down just because he'd seen it. He called me out on it over DM's (understandably I think?) and I apologised, saying it was in bad taste and explaining that it was meant as a joke but that's no excuse, which set him off into saying my asking questions about his study period was belittling and trivialising his nine months recovery from his concussion. I again, realised how I came across and apologised for myself but he was fuming and assumed it was my intention to have a dig at him, which it wasn't. (Considering I had been one of the only constant friends actively visiting him and keeping an eye on him since he got the concussion.)

I asked him about five times over message if he'd like to talk this out irl but at this point, he went around boycotting the hell out of me and doing passive aggressive little things, so I (again, in anger and bad taste) replied by doing little petty things. I really just put it all down as ""yeah, we'll sort it all out ourselves"" because we'd both been kind of shitty, until he chose to go out of his way and confront my sister (f11) about whether I'd been shit talking him at my house. I asked him why he thought that was appropriate and if he wanted to know that, he could have just spoken to me and he went off on a barrage of how I was a terrible person and how he never wants to speak to me again, but he never acknowledged that he'd gone and confronted a child five years younger than him, kind of intimidating her??? I asked him how he'd feel if I'd done that to his brother (a year younger than us but allegedly autistic) and he went off again and blocked me without answering me.

Now I know I was an asshole for how I handled things initially, but surely I'm not the only asshole here? AITA for being angry he dragged my sister into this when there was no need too? He's insistent that I'm the only asshole but surely we're both as bad as each other?"		1	0
bwmxvf	2019-06-04 10:00:43	throwmydadaway12	AITA for uninviting my best friend and dad to my wedding and calling him out in front of everyone?	"
EDIT: I am 20, former BFF is 22.


My dad’s been in and out of my life due to drugs. For the past 3 years he’s been sober and is about to move closer to me because of a new job, or so I thought. I’m getting married Friday. I was excited about my dad’s progress. He was going to be the one to give me away but that’s not happening.

My former BFF has a 2 year old daughter. As it turns out, her daughter and I are related. C and my dad have been in a secret relationship and he only straightened up after he found out she was pregnant. I always thought it was odd that my dad was overly affectionate with C’s daughter, but it makes sense now. 

I found out C’s daughter is my half sister when we were rehearsing for the wedding and I realized that I forgot decorations at my house. C’s daughter got sick all over her clothes and she didn’t bring extra, so she needed to get some. I told her I’d take her and her daughter by her apartment to get clothes because it’s on the way to my house. I go in and I had to use the bathroom so I follow her into the apartment. When I step outside the bathroom, I see her dress and my dad’s suit hanging up together, presumably from the cleaners. In her daughter’s room where she was changing her, I also saw a framed picture of my dad holding her. I asked her what it was doing there and she froze and was unable to come up with an explanation. 

I got back in my car and drove to my house without saying a word. I left her and her daughter back at her apartment and I still don’t regret it. I was angry and didn’t want to go back to the venue, obviously. Eventually my fiancé came and took me back. I didn’t tell him what was going on but he knew I was upset. When we got back to the venue I unleashed HELL on my dad and called him out and told him he wasn’t going to be the one to walk me down the aisle and give me away. 

It ruined the mood and everyone left. My mom said I should’ve handled it in private and not been as harsh, so I’m beginning to rethink my choice. I texted my former best friend to let her know she was uninvited and I have blocked both of them on every platform. I know I caused a scene but I was so angry and still am. I can’t believe they’ve been doing this behind my back for a few years. My dad isn’t moving so he can be closer to his job, he’s moving in with my former best friend because they have a kid together and they’re in a relationship and have been for quite some time now. Not only that, but she lied to me about who the father was and I believed her.

bwmt0n	2019-06-04 09:41:22		AITA for confronting coworker for not helping me take a call while I was busy with a customer?	"I work as a cashier at a Red and Blue Game Piece pizza place. I don’t like asking for help on phones since I understand that the guys making pizzas are busy making pizzas and the oven tender is busy tending the oven.

I have this coworker who is about to be promoted to Assistant Store Manager. She seemed okay when I first met her but I started to notice that during the times that we were not busy she would hang out by the oven and not answer the phone if I was busy cleaning or folding boxes. The only time she would want to go to the front would be when a customer comes through the door.

This incident happened on Saturday while we weren’t busy. I was busy taking the payment from a customer and the phone started ringing. She comes around, interrupts me as I was talking to the customer to tell me that she was going to put the line on hold. I gave the customer his order and attended to the customer on hold. After I finished with them I headed to the back to find her chatting with other coworkers. 

I did my best not to sound nasty as I asked her why she didn’t tend to the customer on the phone instead of interrupting me to tell me that she was going to put them on hold for me. 

She replied with,” Well, you were finishing up with the customer and you are on phones aren’t you?”

I told her that yes, I am on phones but that we needed to help each other out and that if I am busy and if she or anyone else has time then she could attend to the customer instead of relying on one person to do it.

She exploded after I said this and yelled,  “You don’t confront me with shit!” and walked outside. The Assistant Store Manger was present and didn’t do much besides tell us both to calm down. He doesn’t really like dealing with problems and from what I know he is only an ASM because the General Manager needs the help. Anyways he spoke to me later on and told me that she only put the customer on hold for me to deal with because she felt as if I was “stealing the customers that were walking in.” 

Whoever is on the register sometimes gets tips so I think that’s why she rushes to the front with the bell door chimes.

I spoke to my coworker after she had calmed down. I told her that I was sorry for making her feel as if I was stealing the customers away from her but that we do need to work together. She agreed and we shook hands and that was that.

My brother works there as well as lead driver and he told me that I shouldn’t have apologized and he told me to tell the GM about what happened since he feels that the GM should know what to expect since this lady is going to become a manager. I’m not sure if I should have confronted her. I think I should have waited to tell the GM. So AITA for confronting my coworker?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bwmq6l	2019-06-04 09:29:58	nayrexe	AITA for repeatedly asking a manager to stop clicking his pen?	"I work in an office that's usually quiet. My job involves processing background checks, so as you can imagine, accuracy when processing these is important. Me, a coworker, my manager and the department manager with her assistant. Five people.

&#x200B;

Until around 2-3 hours into the shift, when the manager of a different section comes in. He's part of the department, but I don't answer to him. He sits directly behind me. We sit back to back, pretty much.

&#x200B;

He. Is. LOUD.

&#x200B;

Now, he's a nice guy and I like him. Very friendly and helpful... but he talks loudly, types loudly, his phone ringer is loud and he shouts down the phone to whoever is on the other end (and never seems to stop talking, so I struggle to see how a conversation can occur). I sometimes think he's unaware that others are in the office, trying to work. These, I can kind of deal with... it's a struggle, but I can somehow tune this out. Or I'll go sit elsewhere if it's too loud.

&#x200B;

Then... the pen.

&#x200B;

He'll start clicking his pen (or worse, constantly remove and replace the lid of a highlighter). That noise is hell to me. It's not even on a pattern... it's sometimes fast, sometimes slow, he'll stop for a few seconds or a minute, then do it rapidly... ugh.

&#x200B;

Eventually, it got so bad, I had to mention it. My first attempt was 'what's that clicking noise?', where he responded that he was clicking his highlighter pen... and of course, he didn't stop.

&#x200B;

I asked him politely to stop clicking the pen, while trying to do my work. He puts the pen down... for a few seconds. Or his phone rings, and he picks the pen up again. Of course, I can't interrupt him mid-phone call. He seems to think no-one can hear him while he's on the phone.

&#x200B;

I've asked him several times now to stop pen-clicking, which he does... then resumes a few minutes later.

&#x200B;

He obviously needs to fidget.

&#x200B;

I tried giving him a silent-clicking pen. When he realised it didn't make a noise, it got put in his desk drawer and never used again.

&#x200B;

I tried giving him a fidget spinner (our local 'single-unit-currency' store stocks them), as an alternative to his pen. He used it for a day... and then starting spinning the thing, and using his pen to stop it from spinning! The result is now a rapid 'clack-clack-clack' noise. I found it on the floor the day after, so I pushed it under his desk drawer unit so he wouldn't find it again.

&#x200B;

I've even mentioned this to my manager, saying that I can't concentrate while that ear-grating clicking is going on. Of course, I'm just told that there's nothing that he can do.

&#x200B;

Am I just being overly sensitive to noise? AITA for asking him to stop... repeatedly?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I messaged her today to ask if she needed any help with the latest (and biggest) assignment so far, and she responded that she is fucked and will pay me if I do so and help out a little bit of writing. This would be a few hours work for me, but I'm happy to do it for free. That's what friends are for, right?

Except she offered $1250 and right now I could really do with the money. So I'm simultaneously saying no no, I couldn't possibly take your money for this, but I really want to say yes.

She says because we are good friends she doesn't want me to do it for free, but I feel weird accepting so much money from a friend for this. To my knowledge, she is not well-off and this is a lot for her too.

Am I missing some kind of social cue, where I'm not supposed to accept the money? I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I would 100% take the money if we weren't friends.

It is just before closing and I can tell the server lady has had the same kind of day I've had, so I make an effort to be nice and walk out with my drinks.  As I walk out a girl gets out of her car and asks me to buy her a couple of boxes of booze. She hands me $100 and say's her ID is expired. Not wanting to be the asshole I tell her I'll try.  

I had seen her exact order on the bench as I paid my money.  So I aproach the server and tell her the story,  girl wants booze, got no ID. The server lady says ""oh you mean the girl that just swore at me?""

Oh well that makes all the difference doesn't it?  I said ""yes probably, but watch this.""

So I proceed to purchase a smaller box of one type and a different flavor of another box.

The order comes to $35 less than what the foul mouthed lady wanted.  

I smile at the server and put $15 into my pocket and smile, ""This is her tax""

The server lady smiles and says ""Oh, what a shame.""

I walk out the shop, hand the two boxes to the girl and give her $40 change, ""Next time don't be a bitch""

After a long day at a food truck festival where I even I ran into my older sister and her family (my brother-in-law and 1 1/2 year old nephew). My sister calls me at around 8:30 pm and asks me a huge favor. She ordered food from a place downtown, we live less than 2 miles away from each other, but she ordered directly from the restaurant instead of an app and the restaurant itself doesn't deliver.

&#x200B;

She wanted me to either pick it up for her or drive to her place so she can take my car to the place to pick up her food. She couldn't go herself because my brother-in-law accidentally took his keys for his car with him to a football game with my nephew. He took her car because the car seat was all ready to go and so was the rest of my nephews belongings. When she called, I was already in my pajamas and had my dog on my lap and I was just relaxing after a long fun day. When I said no, she hung up on me.

&#x200B;

Now let me preface this, when my sister needs something I am there. I have picked up medicine and food for my nephew when he had the flu. I went grocery shopping for my sister when she was pregnant and tired. I even offer to watch my nephew all the time, but she is a bit overprotective of him and wants someone more responsible, I get it, no offense, although I think I am a great uncle. She even asked to borrow cash from me at the same food truck festival earlier that day because they didn't have enough cash in hand.

bwmkup	2019-06-04 09:07:34	purplecannibal	AITA For refusing to visit my in-laws again?	"My fiance bought a car from his parents and was paying them off weekly. He got sick and his work didn't pay him for that week, so out of the kindness of my heart, I took off from work to go pay his parents the money for the car.

The original agreement was that every time a payment was made he would sign next to the amount paid and his father would sign that he has received it. So I want over to their house to pay, his mother said I can just give her the money its no need to sign, I said no i would like to sign, all while shes not letting me in im standing in the street and shes in the yard. 

She started to get mad that i wouldn't just give her the money, i kept on being super nice and asked politely that i insist on signing in the book for the money.

She lost her temper and yelled at me in the street in front of my grandfather and at that moment my FIL  got home with his work friend, and everyone saw her yelling at me (will skip what she said but i went home crying).

I tried to do a good thing, this happened in March 2019, since then she hasn't apologized to me since the incident i haven't gone over to them. His father only talks about how he beats people up at bars and his mother tells me every time how she cut her sons gf's neck with a saw (they are rough people) and i try to keep to myself and not judge them

Im kind of happy it happened because i really don't like them and now i have a reason to not visit them, although i have always treated them with respect and i have never kept my fiance from visiting his parents, he just has to go alone now

Took my 7 year old daughter to a friend's birthday party. She's normally well behaved, but today she was kind of a brat. She stuck her finger in the kid's cake to eat some frosting. I told her if she misbehaves again, we are leaving the party.

It came time for everyone to sing happy birthday. My daughter interrupted the song by singing cha cha cha as follows:

Happy birthday to you, \[Daughter: cha cha cha\] \[Me: STOP\]

Happy birthday to you, \[cha cha cha\]

Happy birthday dear Aiden, \[Cha Cha Cha\]

Happy birthday to you, \[cha cha cha\]

I told her ""stop"" after the first line of the song, but she kept doing it. It was super embarrassing, as she was drawing attention to herself instead of the birthday boy while simultaneously throwing everyone off rhythm. I grabbed her arm and we left as she started crying and throwing a fit, saying she didn't do anything wrong.

I had dated my ex-girlfriend(Victoria) for a year and a half and towards the end it got rocky. I considered breaking up with her but she wanted me to reconsider our relationship. After some thinking, nothing changed and I still felt like we weren't compatible. We broke up. Shortly after that, Victoria and I met up to talk about our relationship and ended up hooking up. She still wanted to be my friend, so we would meet up from time to time to study and by the end of it, we would always hook up. This went on for a few months. At the same time, I hooked up with her close friend(Karen) on one drunken night. Karen and I had a friends with benefits while I was still hooking up with Victoria. I didn't tell either of them because that would have compromised my friends with benefits deal that I had with Karen that I became more fond of, and I didn't feel an obligation to tell Victoria about anything either because we had already broken up. If we were still together, I would have been honest with her from the get go, but we were just hooking up. I made it clear that I didn't want any feelings involved with Victoria. Eventually, Karen confided in Victoria that she had been hooking up with me, thus unveiling both secrets. Karen confronted me about this and we talked it over, and realized that we had feelings for one another. Victoria didn't want us to do anything with our feelings because that would ultimately hurt too much and ruin the friendship that she had with Karen. A week later or so, Karen and I decided that we were going to get together, regardless of what my ex's wishes. AITA hooking up with my ex girlfriend's close friend, despite us already being broken up? I truly believe I am not doing anything wrong here.	Asshole	0	0

One of my classes was a public speaking class and in it we needed to give an informative speech. I collect perfume, so I decided I’d do a speech about the history of my favorite perfumer, Guerlain. This speech was set up in a chronological order, and I used the fragrances themselves to be like checkpoints through history. I decided it’d be a cool thing to put together little baggies with some strips of paper soaked in each of the mentioned scents (each separated into their own baggies). 

That’s just some context, now the day before my speech, a girl gave a speech on her epilepsy and some history and facts about the condition. Red flags went off immediately for me about my presentation cause, well she mentioned she was sensitive to smells and although she hadn’t reacted badly to the little bit of fragrance I wore daily, I didn’t know if this would be an issue.

So here’s where the question lies, after class I went up to her and I told her what all I was planning on doing for my presentation and after hearing her presentation, I wanted to give her a forewarning about it and I asked if there was anything/any modifications she needed me to do to my presentation. She just kinda sat there with a blank face and told me that she appreciates my concern, and then told me my question was very ableist and kinda offensive.

I said I was sorry, I didn’t realize it was, and I left it there. I did my presentation just fine, and she was fine, but ever since then I felt kinda bad about it. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwmi35	2019-06-04 08:56:03	TrappedFrame	WIBTA for letting my 3yo nephew go into foster care?	"Quick back story: The child’s mother (my wife’s sister) is addicted to meth and is a prostitute and the father has been ghost his entire life. The mother abandoned him and left him with their other sister whom she was living with at the time. The other sister eventually got fed up with the situation and basically told my wife that either we can take him or she will call CPS and let them handle it. This took place in Arizona which has a notoriously bad foster care system which usually ends up in abuse, so we couldn’t let that happen. We decided to take him for the time being.

Fast forward to now, my wife and I are at our wits end. We have 3 children of our own that we are struggling to provide for, we are currently co-living with my Mom and splitting rent/bills because we are not financially secure. My nephew was also born addicted to methadone and we’ve noticed some potential development issues coming to the surface. He can’t speak very well for his age, he doesn’t understand potty training, very destructive, whiny and just very difficult in general. I’ve seen my wife break down several times and cry because she just isn’t equipped to deal with it. It’s also taking a toll on my kids who have started to resent him, even though they may be picking that up from me and their mother. We love him, we want the best for him, but I don’t think we can provide it for him.  We don’t want to be angry with him or take out our frustrations on him because none of this is his fault, but we can’t do this anymore. We decided that we would look into other options, but there is nobody else in the family that can or will take him. The parents are MIA and the other sister said no because she needs to put her family first, which I understand. So this leaves us with the option of getting the state involved and letting him go into the system (in Texas). Just the thought of this makes me sick to my stomach and I don’t know if I could live with the guilt. But I also know that we can’t live like this any longer.

"My ex and I have a 5 year old daughter who we have joint legal custody of. I live about 2 states away. I see her a few times a year for 2-3 weeks each time. I call every night. 

My ex has primary physical custody and they live with her boyfriend of 3 years. 

She very obviously wants me to not be a part of my daughters life at all and just be a paycheck to her every month. 
She has successfully taught my daughter to call me by my first name, of which my daughter has specifically stated that “mommy told her to”. 
She has successfully taught my daughter that I’m not her real dad, but that the boyfriend is her real dad. 

This visit, I asked her if she could call me dad and not my first name. And she replied “yes, only if you don’t tell mommy”. 
So I thought I had gotten a small victory, as she spent this last week calling me dad with no hesitation. 

I was wrong. 

During her phone call tonight with her mom, she goes “he asked me to call him dad and I don’t want to”... 

Now, my ex is blowing up my phone, saying that asking my daughter to call me dad is confusing to her and cruel, since she’s referred to my ex’s boyfriend as her dad/daddy for 2 years now. My ex says I’m emotionally damaging her by “suddenly changing things”, even though I’ve tried to fix this issue several times over those last 2 years. 

WIBTA if I continued to coach my daughter that I’m her real dad, even though she says she doesn’t want to call me that? 

I’m actually struggling with whether I should continue to correct her or just give up. I don’t want to confuse her but I think it’s absolutely abusive that she’s been taught otherwise. I also don’t want to contribute to the damage to her emotional state. 


FYI: this is not the first time I’ve tried to correct the issue, but it is the first time my daughter has ever complained about it to her mom. Wanted to make that clear."		1	0

bwmh6i	2019-06-04 08:52:04		WIBTA if I refused to go to dinner with my bf and his mother?	"Hello Reddit, this is about a relationship.

So, my bf and I both moved to the same city to go to college but we live in two different houses. He’s got no siblings, so his parents miss him more than my parents miss me apparently...

Because of this, he feels obliged to spend long periods at their house during summer, coming to visit me almost never and coming to college city only to take tests ... this annoys me a lot, I can understand his parents want to see him but I’d also love to spend some time with him during summer months, otherwise we only spend time together during lessons period, which is not the exact definition of having a good time together.

Anyway, I tried to explain him my reasons and he explained me his, we are trying to find a compromise. A few days ago he told me he would leave the college city to go to his parents for a week or so. I was pretty sad but okay, fine, his life at home needs him so I’m  okay with him going, even if this makes me sad. The fact is that he would have left Monday morning, but his mother told him she would come visit him on Friday evening, she will stay here and they will leave together on Saturday afternoon. 

It’s not the first time she does so,  always during the weekend, always in the only few days where we can sleep together and wake up all cozy and spend the day cuddling and doing things together. Plus, she would have seen him Monday for more than a week so it really seems to me as a way to keep the two of us distant and to make him realise that I’m his gf but she, the mother, comes first.

He was pretty upset with this but again, he feels obliged to his parents, which is right, and asked me to go on dinner with him and his mother on Friday evening. Now, I don’t want to put him in a bad situation saying “no”, and I’m planning to return home for the weekend, too (we come from two different cities). I’m just wondering if I’m being childish and TA for not wanting to see her since she deliberately “ruined” our last weekend together before exams."		1	0

Honestly, we all do it to eachother, and not to sound like an ego tripper, but I’m definitely the best at it.

I love doing it, and I do it really well, especially to one teammate who tries to put up a fight and roast me back. It’s all good fun, yes, but I’m thinking maybe I should tone it down a bit or cut it out all together as even though it’s all in good fun, it’s not a good way to treat your friends?

We have a group chat, and we’ll roast and rib eachother in that, too. I’m notorious for being brutal and will straight up bully someone for a mistake. Like, he dishes it back - but it goes like that pretty much all the time now. I guess I’m just trying to think is it bad that this is becoming kind of my personality - a tough, uncaring athlete?

After she lost custody her mom/my other grandma and her sisters basically disowned her and even though she tried to come over to family get together and visit and call me, the family always prevented it. My half brother was older so he always saw her because his side of the family didn't have the same hate for her. Now he thinks I'm wrong for this but the grandmother that didn't raise me (mom's mom) cut my mom out of the will and left her part to me instead, as well as her other four kids who are all well off. My brother told me it was inappropriate to take this inheritance as my mother is unable to work and destitute and could use her inheritance to bring her house up to code. The rest of the family said it was OK to take it because my mom didn't raise me or spend any money on me. So we all hid the fact she was cut out of the will and got her to sign papers saying she wouldn't contest it. Since she is mentally ill she didn't realize anything was wrong until the money was all dispersed and someone accidently told her. 

It's now been two years and mom owes property taxes and she has no heat/hot water and may lose the house. I don't want to pay for any of this but also am worried my brother will tell my friends and colleagues (I'm a social worker) and i will be mortified.

As a background, I’m currently a stay at home mom with a 16 month old. 

A few months ago, i decided its time to go back to work and started to look for jobs. I discussed this with my boyfriend and he agreed. During this time, I reached out to a few daycare places where my potential job would be. I relayed these finding to him each time. 

About 2 weeks ago, my interviews were getting more serious and it sounded like I was going to land a job sooner then later. Then today was the day that I got a call for a job offer. They asked me when I could start and I said in two weeks. This is where the problem started

I got into an argument with my boyfriend because he asked me why did I accepted the offer without discussing with him first about our child daycare needs. I told him my reasoning and that I researched and found one for 20/he. I told him it was a temporary solution until we can find a more permanent solution. 

Then he exploded and started to yell at me. He got angry because I didn’t apologize for making this decision without him. 

How I said it was “Yes, I should have consulted you but they wanted me to start ASAP especially when I interviewed with them over 4 weeks ago. I’m sorry but the fact is I felt pressured to make the decision now and given that I did the research about the child care, I know our child would have some sort of day care.”

So I then asked him how long did you want me to delay it for then. He said he didn’t know and that he needed to do the research for daycare.  I got mad and asked him why didn’t he do it before I got interviews. 

He said there’s no point in looking because you were technically unemployed. I told him this is not the kind of thing you’d wait on. There are waitlist and background checks you have to do. That’s why I already started doing it. He said he wasn’t mad at the fact that I’ve been searching, it was the fact that I made the decision without consulting him. 

I don’t feel like I’m the asshole for making the decision for a 2 week start date since based on our argument it would have been two weeks anyways. 

TLDR: boyfriend is mad that I have a two week start date for a job when I should talk to him to extend it longer depending on when we would find childcare service.

There is a girl who i was dating for 2+ years. after a rough patch of few months and almost a breakup

we decided to try to give it a shot again. Not jump into a relationship again just keep talking and see where things are leading.

In her past behavior she never liked me when i roast/interacted like a boyfriend on her social media posts, so today she asked me ""why i don't follow her""

So i did follow her again and replied to one of her tweets saying  ""lol nobody seeing your tweet"". 

She FREAKED out so much that she sent me 10 texts back to back saying ""delete the reply what the fuck""

Her twitter account is pretty much dry nobody interacts with her or anything no likes or replies hence i said what i said, still she freaked out so much.

When i asked her why she got so worked up she said vague things like she don't like it or this and that which was seeming off

""So i said something feels fishy""

&#x200B;

She told me off by saying and i quote 

""Fuck off dude stop talking to me you've no right to question me

I'll not let you roast me, you don't have that right anymore so fuck off please god you've made me reach my peak anger point by pulling out your old self you've no fucking right now to say shit like fishy or sumn shut the fuck up. Don't reply me anything or you'll get a fat block""

bwmb8x	2019-06-04 08:25:10	funguy97714	AITA for changing plans with my sister and her BF after her behavior changed?	"My sister’s college boyfriend has come over to our house for this week during the summer from his long-distance home. My sister and I are close in age and in general, and this is my chance to perhaps get to know her boyfriend a bit better, which my sister has expressed she really wants me to do.

His vacation up here has two stages - him coming over to our house and exploring our hometown, and him driving up with us to my grandma’s lake house. The original plan was that the 3 of us would stay up at the lakehouse stage for 2-3 days together, but I have decided to shorten it to just one for myself, taking the ride back with my mom, who needs to go to work the next morning.

This is largely because my sisters behavior towards me changes in front of other people, particularly with this boyfriend. She will consistently make jokes at my expense, bringing up deep, biting things from my past that I’d rather stay buried, saying things like “remember how annoying everyone found you in HS funguy?” and “you only think like that because you’re a narcissist” if she’s trying to get the upper hand about some sort of debate. I make a lot of jokes as a part of my personality, and even though her bf seems to find me really funny so far, she is always trying to argue that I’m not. I’ve never hid from my sister that I have a big ego and a lot of affection for myself, but I feel it crosses the line to share these kinds of personal flaws that I see in myself with a person I’m just meeting, along with her demeanor change in general. This really gives me mixed signals as to whether she really wants me to get to know her bf, or if she just wants to make herself look better than me for whatever reason. I feel bad for abandoning her and her bf when he flew up specially for this, but I also feel like I didn’t sign up for this, and I’ve never really liked our Grandma’s lake house as much as she does anyways.

The husband is the main breadwinner by far, also does almost all housework including cleaning, shopping and cooking. The wife works part-time but uses the car husband bought while he takes the bus to work.  The husband is a great amateur baker who does these pinterest-level cakes and other baked goods, always contributing to bake sales and events at the common hobby we share. 

Last week the wife started complaining to me 1:1 that she is displeased with how the husband does not make great ""ordinary food"". I expressed that I do not appreciate the ungrateful nature of what she is saying and we ended up having some words and her storming off.

Worth probably to add that the wife also has made pretty open advances towards another guy in our group and talked disrespectfully about the husband before. Worth maybe also noting that as it's my firm believe that respect is the most important thing in a marriage, I would have reacted the exact same way if the tables were turned and it was a guy complaining about a wife that does everything already.

bwm6cq	2019-06-04 08:03:15		AITA for not letting my cousin sleep in my room?	"Something I'd quickly like to mention before talking about the main issue, I never liked my cousin to begin with. She's bossy, emotional and has gotten me into trouble in many situations. One such example is when I went to visit and she locked us both in her room, refused to let me out when my mum called me and started crying about her boyfriend not taking a picture with her. At the time this happened I was 16 and she was 20. I also happen to be gay and she's homophobic, I came out to her once but quickly withdrew it when I realized her reaction wasn't great.

&#x200B;

So she came over to my house (I live in Australia and she lives in a certain country that hates Pakistan) and wanted to stay in my room despite there being three others available. I don't want her near my bed or in my room, I don't think I'm close enough to her as friends to have her sleep next to me and tolerate her stealing my blankets. She also has this habit of clinging to me in her sleep that I just find creepy. I said no and apparently she complained to everyone because she can't sleep alone and gets nightmares.

&#x200B;

When I see her next I apologize and she says it's cool. Ok, the issue's solved and we're both fine. I tried to make the best of the situation when we visited her and I talked to her about her wanting to study overseas and tried to help her convince her parents. Before I say the next part bear in mind she was the one who asked me to stay in her room, I was fine with being anywhere. So I'm laying on one side of my pillow and she literally comes and sits on the other half near my face, obviously kind of ew. I ask her nicely to stop but she keeps doing the same thing with the entire 'this is my room' thing. I say ok and I get my stuff and leave the room.

bwm60n	2019-06-04 08:01:53		WIBTA if I ask people/say that I don't like being referred to as 'girl', 'sis', 'queen' and so on?	"Gay cis male here. So it is kind of quite common for gay people to refer to themselves with female terms, and like I guess with the de-gender-ification of words like girl, sis, and queen, many of my straight friends are catching up too. They (and my queer friends) use it amongst themselves and to each other as well, so they are definitely not trying to 'feminize' me or whatever on account of my sexuality.

&#x200B;

But, I am not sure why, it kinda disturbs me- I don't like being referred to by female nouns (that happens once in a while). I don't say anything cause they are almost definitely using it in a gender neutral manner, and so I don't know whether I would be the asshole, if I just brought up how I didn't like it, regardless of the innocent intent.

&#x200B;

Part of the reason I feel this way is perhaps because it took me a really long time to come to terms with being gay- internally homophobic me associated being gay and being feminine for a really long time and I kind of hate it but sometimes my stupid brain makes this inadvertent connection again and again and hence the female pronouns bother me. I am not against anyone being feminine/masculine but it's like I don't want to feel like I am automatically associated with being feminine just because I'm gay and 'queen', 'sis', 'girl' make me feel that way.

My girlfriend currently works in a coffee shop, but told me the other day she wants to start working in the company i am with. Now i don’t want to hold her back, but i just have some worries.

My main problems are:

• What if we were to break up in the future? I’m fairly well established where i am, and it would be really awkward if we were both still working together.

• I know that in a few years time she’ll want to have kids and work in a part time job. Working as an electrician around home is a fairly full time job, as is child minding. I’m not saying that as in the man should work, i mean she has told me SHE wants to just work part time and mind the kids, do house-wifey things.

• She can sometimes lack conviction in what she does. She went to college, and dropped out after a year. She worked a few jobs, dropped them quick as shit. This is a problem because it’s a 4 year apprenticeship to become an electrician. What is also a problem is that i have also explained that being an electrician is very tiresome on your body, so I recommended she goes on afterwards to do quantity surveying, which will keep her in work, but mean she will have to do night classes. Again, i’m not sure she has the conviction.

• she has complained to me several times that she’s sick of working full time, and just wants to work part time, and work on makeup and beauty stuff. This goes completely against being an electrician, because it is a VERY full time job (anywhere between 8-12 hours a day plus weekends)

She wasn't having it, she kept pushing and I eventually cave and got her one. The entire time she was gone and I had the kitten was hell for me. I felt trapped since I wasn't near my family since we live pretty far away and really couldn't travel an long distance to vist them with the 8 week old kitten by myself. I eventually started to feel depressed and alone until my wife came back. After a while her mom started having some kind of mental break down. I won't elaborate since it's not important but there were a few instances I got stuck with the cat by myself or I traveled with cat by myself and I hated it.

He has a dog. My wife brought it up about keeping it. I refused and gave her scenarios of if she deploys again and if I need to go incase of a family emergency. Does she trust him to take care of both of them. Which she understood and our cat doesn't get along with dog anyway. 

Fast forward to today, she texted me telling me that she couldn't refuse him. Saying that he was about to cry when he put up his last battle to keep the dog. Which I told her I understood the circumstances and it was ok but I'm just scared that I'm going to be stuck with a dog and a cat that I didn't want and unable to leave.

So a little backstory, we dated for 2 years and I was the dumpee. I bought the ps4 that she has now early in our relationship as a second ps4 for myself to play at her place and for her to use as well. We agreed at that time that it was my ps4 and not hers. Fast forward a year and a half and shes moving back to our home city instead of continuing at our uni. 

So our relationship is pretty serious at this point, like I might want to marry this girl serious, so obvi I give the ps4 to her while we prepare for long distance and the new semester. She ends up breaking up with me and offers to give back the ps4 and ""everything else"" a day after our breakup. But in reality we talked it through and decided on a break instead of a breakup. So again another reason she keeps the ps4 cause were not actually broke up and I was still very much in love with her.

Fast forward another 3 months to now and the break turned into a were better off as friends. After long thought I told her that I thought she should pay me back for the ps4 and extra controller I gave her and requested 100 dollars. She denied paying me and said she would just give it back. 

Now she says shes not giving it back and that I'm scummy for even asking. She says she wont pay me and wont give it back and that it was a gift that she offered back to me and I refused. She told me that if I came to her house her dad would ""hurt my feelings and then break the ps4"" It has certainly thrown any friendship we could've had out the window since any situation for me to try to get it back ends in a losing situation for me.

"Sorry that the title of this is so vague, I didn't know how to compress it into a sentence. I'll keep this as brief as I can and please feel free to ask any clarifying questions in the comments. 

So my [19M] parents kicked me out two years ago. There was blame on both sides there, and it is what it is. One of their conditions after kicking me out was that I wasn't allowed to speak to or see my younger sisters [17, 14 and 5] any more. Of course I was upset by that, but I did break one of their rules and I couldn't think of a lot of things that I could do in order to circumvent that condition without making things worse for everyone so I kind of made my peace with it and tried my best to move on. 

I recently started having a little secret contact with my eldest sister via Facebook. Our middle sister, the 14yo, is something of an aspiring stage actress and she recently landed a role as Nancy in her theatre group's performance of Oliver! It's her first big leading role, and I'm insanely proud of her for getting it. She's apparently asked our parents if I'll be there and they just wouldn't talk to her about it. 

I really want to go along and show my support for her. My plan is to sit somewhere inconspicuous and slip out at the end hopefully unnoticed. I'm still figuring out how I'd let her know I was there (current plan is just have the oldest sister tell her). However, I'm apprehensive. I know if I go and my parents spot me/find out there'll be hell to pay. God knows what kind of trouble I'll be in, but I'm more concerned that it'll also get my sisters in trouble - the oldest for speaking to me and the middle for asking about me more than the once - and I really really don't want that. I'm just completely torn. I really want to support my little sister, and I know the chance of my parents seeing me in a large packed theatre is slim, but it's still a chance all the same.

I'm an actor at my local community theatre and have been doing plays there for the last year or so. Recently I was casted in a play (I won't say the name of it to avoid anyone I know seeing this) and I've been having a great time with rehearsals and all. For the first month of rehearsals we hadn't had a full cast yet. We were missing a character yet to be cast due to some reasons that don't matter. We eventually casted someone (Let's call him Mike) and even though Mike was late to the party he graciously accepted the role. We were all very happy.

The thing is, Mike is a trans man, ftm
And there is a rather awkward running joke in this play. A joke in which a male character magically turns into a female. I personally do not find this type of joke funny, but I'm not offended by it either. I just feel that we are past using men in dresses for comedy relief. But it does not bother me at all. I hardly took notice of it in the script. This play is a parody and a comedy, I just took it as joke that didn't land with me.

However, Mike felt a different way about this and took full offense to it. He was very angry when he saw the scene and expressed that to a few other cast mates...
He talked to me about it and we discussed how it's ok to feel that way about an awkward joke, but if he really feels strongly about it he needs to talk to the director or something. Mike agre8ed and I figured that was the end of it.

So we're at the homestretch of rehearsals (Tech week.) we've been doing rehearsal for a couple months now and we've all worked very hard. Everything is fine, when suddenly one of the actors comes up to me and says Mike quit the show. He left in the middle of tech rehearsal...4 days before opening night. I'll be honest...I was furious. We've all worked so hard for this and Mike screwed all of us over. I understand how he feels and even agree to some extent, but he cannot do this to us. We have all been extremely respectful to his idenity and have used the correct pronouns and everything. 

Mike had told me that he didnt actually read the script before he took the role. And even when he did, he only read his own parts. It was only when we actually got on stage instead of being in the rehearsal room that he saw the gender change scene. Maybe I'm an asshole, but isn't that his own fault? He went weeks without knowing about that scene. I feel that if he had read the script he would have had the chance to back out early and we wouldn't be in this situation now. I'm very angry and feel the show is going to lose a lot of it's quality because we have to find a replacment.

We were never ""friends"" but I'm thinking of blocking him on all social media and never talking to him again. I'm pissed. Am I being an insensitive asshole?

TLDR,; Trans castmate quit theatre show 4 days before opening night

bwlmew	2019-06-04 06:43:58		AITA: I’m going through a lot AITA if I don’t tell my family?	"I recently got out of a rehab center. I’m not going to use a throwaway because I’m ok with people putting 2 and 2 together. I’m on mobile and English is my first language so if I fuck it up that’s on me. 

I got out of rehab and started to slowly tell my in laws, they were understanding. I love my in laws more than I ever thought possible. My immediate family however has been nothing but a pain in my ass. 

My whole life my mom and grandparents pushed me to be “better”. You know the saying, “keeping up with the Jones’?” That is my life, literally, I’m trying to keep up with these people. They are shocked that I can actually do it, my husband makes a lot of money and I CAN keep up the Jones’ in my family. I hate it, I do not want to become these egotistical people who place their worth on belongings. I also don’t want to be left behind. 

So what I came here to say is, I’m feeling so good. I want to “ keep up with Jones’” without my immediate family catching on. I have become that selfish person that doesn’t want my flaws to be public.. so am I an asshole for hiding this from my family but telling my in-laws everything? I’m really ok if they “find out” but I really don’t want to be the one to tell them. If they do find out we are all so superficial I know we can brush it off as “nasty politics”.? 

And bonus I already know that I’m an asshole for falling into the egotistical shit my family brought on. I’m working on it, I really am."		1	0

bwlltt	2019-06-04 06:41:30	ImaZebraCat	AITA for being 'immature' when it comes to my best freind?	"Ok so the title IS kind of clickbaity but I find this kind of funny either way.

So a little backstory. This school year, I was in 7th grade(im in 8th now). In 6th grade I had a group of friends that would basically eat lunch together at lunchtime, text eachother memes, ect. Sadly I didn't have ANY classes with these friends in 7th grade and so I was (understandably) lonely. Basically I took mainly advanced classes and they didnt.

In 7th grade I had advanced lit and advanced history with a girl I went to elementary school with. (Let's call her Lily cause she's the best(not her real name)) but in elementary we didnt really talk much or KNOW eachother. 

In 2nd period (which was lunch period and advanced lit) she was sitting at the same table as the gug I had a crush on and I was sadly placed away from him cause I came into class late. Since most people were anyways, I gave into peer pressure and moved to sit next to Lily. 

Most of my friends were friends with Lily and I've heard only good things about her so I talk to her and we quickly become good friends. That day I decided to sit with her at lunch, because I had no friends in that class I just kind of wandered around (at my middle school were assigned a table to sit at so..)

Anyways, we talk and talk until we become best friends. We know basically everything about eachother.

At this point in time Lily is dating a guy from the group I had in 6th grade (let's say his name is David (also not his real name)) and they went to middle school homecoming together. Lily invited me and another one of our friends to go with them and we had fun, then we ended up having a sleepover which was when we become BEST best friends. Which was new to me.

Lily and David breakup because he cheated on her or something. Later she moves 4 hours away to live with her dad. She's much happier now and she has a boyfriend who she really likes. We still keep contact, too.

Now to the actual shit.

So recently David texts Lily and asks her to take him back (idk if he knew but she had and still has  a much better boyfriend)

Basically he told her he wanted her and she asked how and he said romantically and she just put a ton of XD's.

She screenshots the conversation and posts it onto insta. I commented that she was a queen even tho David was my friend.

Good old comedy, ya know?

Well, later I was texting him that I passed and so did he and then he mentioned the comment.

He said he didnt really care but that I was immature and rude so I just typed lol and sent it.

He said 'so this is how you deal with immaturity'
And I put yup with a cute little smiley face.

He gets annoyed and idk but he said something about my family and I said idk if I runs in my genes or not but comedy is the best remedy or something along those lines.

He left me on read. Idk I found it hilarious that he took this seriously but idk if I'm being the asshole or not. Which is why I'm here. Cause I dont wanna be an asshole."	TL;DR	0	0
bwlkvp	2019-06-04 06:37:53	Meriland31	AITA For Not Wanting To Let My Husband Spend My Money?	"So, me and my hubby have separate bank accounts. We both contribute 50/50 on basically everything (restaurants, hotels, bills, gas, rent, etc). Me and my husband have never spent each others money before, and we never complained about it at all...but my husband did vaguely suggest a joint account earlier in the relationship,  which I declined (cause I like to save my money, whereas my husband likes to spend spend spend) and he was more than cool with that. I rarely buy myself much and save that leftover and also sell stuff on EBay and Etsy to accumulate for retirement/savings. As a result, I get a comfy nest egg going and am able to occasionally buy us fancy trips every once in a while and take my husband on expeditions, or fancy 5 star restaurants. If we are ever in a bind or he needs help financially, I always do too.

My mom told me that since we are married, my money is his and his is mine..and I am not entitled to my 'own' money alone anymore. I get angry when I hear this (and she isnt the only one I have heard this from). So AITA for doing what I am doing?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwlihc	2019-06-04 06:28:43	digbicks845	AITA for not wanting to reconcile with girl from middle school?	"Back in middle school, I was a pretty quiet kid with my group of friends. So one day they announced that we were gonna have a winter formal. Everyone got really giddy about dates, ya know usual middle school stuff. One day, one of the “popular” girls asked me for my number. “A pretty girl wants to talk to me?? Omg” was basically my reaction as I was pretty taken aback. She texted me later that night hardcore flirting with me, calling me sexy and cute and she asked me to the dance. Excited, I said hell yea and I told all my friends and I felt pretty ecstatic about the whole thing.

My friends were really skeptical saying “oh she’s just fucking with you, no way she wants to go with you” and I kinda blew them off. Long story short, they were 100% right, the girl outed me in front of like half the grade saying “why would I go with a loser like you” and I was the laughingstock of the school for a while.

I moved to the other side of the country for high school and currently college(not related to event). During this time, I guess I became more outgoing since I had to learn to make new friends. I guess my shyness in middle made me an easy target for her but anyway, that event really fucked me up. Now, anytime a girl flirts with me, my first instinct is always “oh she’s just lying to me” so my relationships since then have been pretty rocky and short. Whenever I told people this, they always say “get therapy”. But I am Indian so therapy isn’t a word in our vocabulary.

Anyway that was all backstory, recently I visited friends from my old town and she was there. At one point, I was all alone so she came over to me and started talking to me trying to catch up on life. Whatever malice I had for her disappeared by that point so I didn't hate her but I didn’t want anything to do with her so I told her to leave me alone and she asked why. I’m like **BRUH**. I basically told her about the trauma

It was one thing if she was like “oh I’m sorry, I was an immature kid yada yada” but she passed it off as a harmless joke. She said “oh it was middle school, I was just having fun, get over it”. And then she started fucking flirting with me again telling me how much I’ve matured and asked to get coffee or something. this really pissed me off so I told her to “go fuck yourself cunt” and some other stuff that I didn’t realize I held in over the years. Not gonna lie, I almost did accept her proposal to coffee and then fuck her and dip for revenge but I’m not really a revenge kinda guy so I put it out of my mind. At the end of my ""rant"", we were both almost in tears so I just left.

Honestly, I feel a lot better now that I got A LOT off my chest. But at the same time, I can’t help feeling bad since I almost made her cry. But then, it’s not like she didn’t deserve it. Her friends texted me saying I was a huge asshole to her over some middle school joke. It wasn’t a joke to me. But anyway, I leave the judgement to y’all AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

dad passed away when I was a child. 

so my brother has been living with my mum rent free for 3 years now after he decided he did not want to work, he just wanted to game all day. 

because he thinks that his life goal is to game he refuses to help my mum around the house, whenever she would ask it would result in Tim calling her every bad name you can think of. and it would normally make my mum cry, not that he cared. finally mum kicked him out. 

he decided to try and ask me if he could stay with me, I said no. as he was leaving I heard him mutter fucking bitch under his breath. 

I then saw red and yelled at him, I hope you end up homeless you fucking asshole, you deserve no love from anyone and I hope to never see you again. and then i said quite loudly YOU ARE NOT MY BROTHER. 

he left in tears and my mum told me I went to far, some of the family agree.

bwlhq9	2019-06-04 06:25:58	SubstantialLimit8	AITA for dancing with a stranger	"I had been good friends with this guy, I’ll call him Jacob, over the past couple of years, and towards the early stages of our friendship, I got the feeling that he liked me. However, he never made a move on me, and I was happy with just staying as friends. Over the course of the first year, Jacob began losing his interest in me but we remained very good friends. We could just talk about anything and I would always have a lot of fun going out with him. In the second year of our friendship, we danced at a club and got kind of intimate. A few days later, he confessed that he had feelings for me and I told him I thought I had feelings for him too but was unsure with myself because I had never been in a serious relationship before. 

A week after he confessed his feelings and we had gone on 3-4 dates, I went to the club with my friends and had a few too many drinks. According to my friends, I danced pretty vulgarly on this random stranger, but it didn’t mean anything to me. About a couple of weeks later, I figured that Jacob and I had too much friction between our lives since he was going to take a job in another city in a year, I had a lot on my plate career-wise, and other general issues. Jacob was very understanding about all of this and could see where I was coming from and why I didn’t want to continue our premature relationship. He wanted some closure and asked me if I had danced that one night with the stranger since he had heard some rumors from my friends about it, but didn’t believe it. Jacob was very hurt of what I had done and felt as though I had disregarded him, but it didn’t really occur to me that I should have not danced with the stranger. He told me that he was going to need a very long time before he could be my friend again. AITA for dancing with that random person, even though we weren’t necessarily 100% exclusive?"

bwlh1e	2019-06-04 06:23:23	CM_UW	AITA for expecting my gf not to throw away perfectly good things, & to at least attempt to make some money?	"I'm 45F and I've been dating my 40 yo gf exclusively for 3 years. She was married, we had an affair, she told her husband. They hadn't gotten along or slept together in years, he worked weird hours, they were rarely at home at the same time, but were co-parents of 2 teens. This week he's moving out & divorce will be final this month. 
We've fought more this week than ever, but I still love her & want it to work out. When he didn't get all of his things out, she packed them up & set them outside for him to get. He didn't, so she threw it all in the trash. Like, boxes of collectibles, books, etc. Things that have monetary value. I suggested she sell them so she'd have the money. She doesn't work, will receive child support and alimony. She didn't  want to look at his shit any longer, so I offered to sell the items & give her the proceeds. Again NO.
She asked me to loan her some money for household items, I offered $650, but at the store it came to $800. She bought all new glasses, dishes, silverware, beach towels, solar lights, etc. I said, if you get rid of any of your dishes or anything, I want to donate them. Today I complained about throwing away all the pool hoses, pump accessories, skimmers, etc. She's mad at me & is going to burn all the trash. I asked if I could set the dishes etc aside & she told me not to touch her trash. Actual household garbage is separate, so it's not nasty or anything. Am I wrong or is she being selfish?

Edit to answer some questions:
I admit I was wrong to get involved with her while she was still married. I accept responsibility, & also know that their marriage was already rocky for many reasons. I won't badmouth her husband, just know that he knew that she & I dated, he was okay with it but didn't want me in their house while he lived there, which I wasn't. He was fully aware that she was with me most weekends. He worked locally, just 24 hour shifts, so it wasn't a m-f job schedule.
I know he knew his things were packed up, and he came over & didn't take them, twice. As for the pool, it's an above ground pool, it was like $300 at Walmart.

"Context: long distance GF and I haven't seen each other in 2 months. Last week, it just so happened she'd be close the city my eldest brother has his summer home in, so we thought it would be nice to meet up there. 

My brother, however, refused to let us stay there. And me being a broke college student, couldn't afford to stay a few nights in a hotel, and since she couldn't either (and couldn't host me at her location), we dropped our plans. 

Im fairly pissed pissed off at my brother, but not entirely sure I have the right to be. 

I definitely get where he is coming from. It's his property and of course he is free to do whatever he wishes, including not letting people stay over, and of course the idea of his brother and his brother's girlfriend in his bedroom will make him slightly uncomfortable. 

But I mean cmon... it's not like i would've been bringing random hookers over for the night. I really like this girl, haven't seen her in a while, and this would've been the perfect opportunity to see each other again.  

Except it didn't get to happen because my brother found it weird to let his lil bro and GF bang in his house lol. 

Again: I know it's his right and I need to respect that... but I also feel like exceptions can be made sometimes to help a bro out. I know I would've done the same for him."	Asshole	1	0

She got A’s and B’s and has around a 3.6 GPA. She was telling me how difficult some of the classes, like organic chemistry were, and how stressful and tiring the school could be.

In response, I told her that one of my high school friends had a son who went to UCLA, graduated in 3 years with honors, and upon graduation, will be working at Amazon. As soon as those words left my mouth, my daughter got so angry and told me that I was comparing me unfavorably to him, that she already felt insecure enough about her abilities at Berkeley, and that she was doing her best at a tough school.

Realizing how angry she was, I replied that my statement had no implications. When my daughter questioned me further, I said over and over, “No comment.” 

Like honestly, my daughter was free to interpret that statement however she wanted. Seriously. But when my daughter refused to talk to me for the rest of the day, and several days after, I called my friend, also a dad, who said that I shouldn’t’ve made that comment.

bwl9kf	2019-06-04 05:56:05	D3struction209	AITA for not wanting to text mom every day on vacation?	"Backstory: I'm a 23 year old male and my mom has always been a bit of an over-controlling helicopter parent who has struggled to let me mature. I've found it easier to lie or omit some details when talking to her in general because of her nature. She's very protective and thinks the world is scary, worries that I might not be OK when I’m on my own. Two big events have recently taken place that mom has not dealt with well: me planning on moving out into my own place next year 2 states away, and me having a long-distance relationship. Girlfriend has gone no-contact with her family because of abuse and a similarly over controlling mom.

As of late, I am planning a trip to see GF who lives in Europe. After I told mom about her, one of her first reactions to me mentioning the trip and gf was ""why cant she come here?"" which seems not supportive to me now but I didn't look too much into it. I stood my ground and said that I wanted to go on this trip to see her home. She's insisted on saying it would make more sense somehow for her to come here (her being younger and holding much less money than me).

Gf and mom got to video call a couple months back and that did not go well as you can imagine. GF ended up having a panic attack because of my mom’s interrogation style. This distresses me greatly since gf considers having a good relationship with my family to be important. As the trip and my moving plan has gotten closer, mom has been acting a bit weirder about me moving and trying to get me to consider staying in this town or at least nearby and not leaving her. One example, mom quite frequently will mention that the state I want to move is too far, and there are plenty of better places in this state. When I've told her the reasons I want to go, she almost seems to ""forget"" them every time like they aren't valid.

Here is the latest dilemma I am in. Mom said i'd promised i would i text her every 24 hours while i'm gone in the other country to visit gf. I do not remember making this promise and I doubt I would make such a promise. I told her that every 24 hours is too much and i would prefer once every few days on my own terms when i was wanting to text her. She got very upset at me for that and said it felt like i wasn't considering her feelings. Her exact words were ""It feels like you're telling me fuck you, I know it will make you upset"". I've told mom that it feels she is not respecting my desire to be independent or mature on my own. Plus this is my vacation, I should be able to spend it how I want. With how lackluster I have been at being an adult, now should be the time I really step up. I want to prove to myself and her that I can be on my own and function without her watching over me 24/7. She says its because she worries about me and wants me to be safe but it feels to me that she cant trust me to function on my own as a 23 year old man.

My train of thought was that I didn’t want to put my boyfriend in a position where he had to run favors for my brother as if he was a younger sibling (background: my family isn’t good at treating my BF with respect and recognizing that this is a real relationship and we aren’t just children because they still only see me as a little sibling). Plus, it was a really stressful night because I have a very toxic mom and I really wanted that drive back to be a quiet time for me to unwind and vent to my boyfriend. Either way, I gave my brother a polite no, he got really mad and defensive, and I explained that I had a right to say no to a request for a favor regardless of circumstances. 
The next morning I woke up to 2 calls from my mother who proceeded to call me (direct quotes) a selfish bitch who ruined everybody’s night, and judged my brother for drinking even though I was no better.
I know that it is a really simple favor and it wouldn’t have been hard to drive him home, but I really want to know if me simply not wanting to bend over and drive him around again after already being late so I could chauffeur him, and not wanted to make my (then-new) boyfriend uncomfortable, was a good enough reason not to do it. So, AITA?"		1	0

bwl7xz	2019-06-04 05:50:18	The_Bitch_Is_Here	AITA for snapping at a kid in school?	" In 5th grade, a new kid got into the same class I was in about 2-3 weeks into the year. (Maybe more). At first, he seemed like a chill person. I went to greet him along with a few other people. He had polite manners at first. 

 But then he started getting more mean and annoying. One story I have about this kid is one time after school, I was walking to where I usually went out. Where I usually went out was a staircase going down to a door. So while I was at the top of the staircase and the kid was in front of me, he turned around and basically screamed in my face, scaring me. Fortunately, a kid saw this and told him that it was completely unnecessary for him to do that. (Yes, That story sounds ridiculous, but it actually happened). 

 I have another story. But here’s something that I should say before I tell this story. I have OCD. I’m currently getting treated for it, but back then it was pretty bad. So one of the things that I had to do is when one leg of a table is touched, I have to touch the other legs of the table so it is “even”. Anyway, this kid eventually caught on to it and intentionally touched the legs of the table so I would have to “even” it out. I’m pretty sure this kid thought that it was funny. Because of this, this made school life horrible for me. I’m pretty sure I actually once got in trouble for getting upset. I refused to tell the teacher why I was upset, so the teacher thought I was upset for no reason. So, the teacher left me outside in the hallway. In reality, the teacher caught me in the middle of me trying to “even” it out, and I was trying to remember how many times I had to touch the legs of the table and which legs needed to be touched while I was out there. 

 Anyway, one day I couldn’t take it anymore and basically screamed at the kid to leave me alone and that he was basically the reason why I hated school. I don’t remember how he reacted. So basically, after that year I moved out of that school to a much better one. But since my older sibling still attended that school, I still had to attend whatever events that was going on. Assemblies, concerts, you name it. Which means that I still saw that kid. Anyway, I had to come for an end of year assembly. The kid that was mean to me saw me and smiled and waved. It wasn’t in like a sarcastic or evil way too. It was in a friendly way. My mom waved to him back for me, since I didn’t because of surprise. After that, that got me wondering if I was too harsh on him.

bwl7fv	2019-06-04 05:48:31		WIBTA for moving up to the top floor of my loft because my roommate and her boyfriend are super loud, every single day	"I'm subletting in a technically 3-bedroom loft, although there's only one other girl living here now. She's gone most of the day, but every night she brings her boyfriend over and they hang out in her room, being super loud and having super loud sex. 

The room I'm subletting is right next to hers, but the apartment has an open third floor that isn't in use right now. Two girls used to split the room, but they're both gone for the summer. This is where there might also be the potential for some assholery, since I'm not paying for their room, I'm paying a different girl the rent for a smaller room. 

It's now 12:30 am, and I'm trying to sleep. This girl is a complete stranger to me and I feel super weird talking to her about her relationship and sex and stuff, so I'm debating just moving my stuff up to the third floor and making that my room. My friends say that'd be an asshole move because I'm paying for the smaller room on the second floor, but the more you interfere with my sleep the less I start to care. I'm already sleeping with earplugs in, and I can still hear them every night. I get that sex is important and I don't want to get in the way of their relationship, and I'm super nonconfrontational so I'd prefer to just head up there and hopefully it's quieter. 

I'm on the fence about asking her since she's actually on the lease here, but I pay rent too and I'm super fed up with this. I also went away for a few days and came back early, and the toilet seat in my bathroom was up the way guys put them up, even though I'm a girl and don't have guys over, so I've also felt like they're invading my space in that way too."

The only two people that I can think of that I have spoken to about her were one of our newly hired employees. Who I did ask about her first shift alone with said Coworker but only due to that new-hire working for the first time with my Coworker. So I was trying to make conversation. On top of that my Coworker was complaining to me about the new-hire and her concerns with working with her. So I was curious how the shift turned out. 

The second of two people was essentially her daughter in law. The two have a rocky history and I was stuck on a shift with said daughter in law. So I was again trying to make conversation. The DIL was talking about how bipolar her MIL was and I agreed because she constantly flips between complaining that noone does things around the store and not doing said things herself while making her coworkers do them instead.

bwl6py	2019-06-04 05:45:49	DavyMosa	AITA for following rules at work?	"A little background to begin I work in a fast-food chain with rather relaxed management most of the time all though we have just received a newish restaurant manager in the last 3 months.

Today I wake up to a message in the work chat saying something along the lines of “Nobody is to take food on there half’s or fifteens now as empty drink bottles have been found in the cool room also we will be enforcing up selling anybody caught taking food or not up selling will receive immediate coaching (like a written warning).

I’m fine with that like I’ve been working in the place since I was in high school procedure is like second nature to me at this point. I get to work tho and notice we are still holding product passed it’s expiry time (our times are quite strict I think 45mins-1.30 for the longest product)  so I immediately throw the expired product in the wastes bins and ask the cook to cook more. 

I spoke with the manager on duty they said this is fine we’re meant to do it anyways and all the other team members agreed with me. Why should we follow procedures which don’t benefit us at all and ignore procedures that only benefit sales etc which don’t even come back to us. 

We get through almost the whole shift without the actual restaurant manger talking to me and the manager on duty also stopped talking to me by mid day. The third and final store manager shows up to take over for night shift and as I’m serving I overhear them talking to other staff saying I’m pathetic and what I’m doing is pathetic. 

The whole day I happily did what they asked us to without an issue all I did was enforce procedure which is what they wanted in the first place. 

All in all I left work feeling super down like I hadn’t done the right thing when I was really just fighting to get our food back.

Those extra costs came from my savings, no big deal as I had much more than my gf. However I am low on money, I do work so I can save again. But my gf didn't spend any of her savings. As we want to use that as a buffer for when we decide to get children.

Last saturday we were in the shop, doing our weekly shopping. We also pick up stuff for my Mother in Law, as the shop we go to isn't near her and she is afraid to drive. This shop has weekly sales on products based on products from different countries. This week is was cuba or something. And my gf grabs around 30 euro worth of non-important product (cookies, candy, ice cream and liquor).

 After we get home, I ask her if she can give me the 30 euro's back as it is quite a lot to buy for someone else. She gets mad and tells me that her mother can't go to the shop and needs this. I tell her that normally I'm fine with paying for her stuff, but it's trice as expensive this week and I simply don't have the money to spend as we just bought the house.

She went to her mother, and slept there. I got a call from my MIL she told me that she would give me the money behind gf's back.

bwl4cp	2019-06-04 05:37:07		AITA for being scared to commit to a white guy who’s sister went viral for extremely racist road rage?	"This is an incredibly weird post so using my throwaway account. 

I’ve been casually dating a guy for a few months and had been eager to get into a relationship with him until I saw a video online of his brother in a violent act of racist road rage. 

She’s caught on camera, yelling expletives like spic, n*gger and other crazy stuff to a young Hispanic man. The other driver did nothing wrong and they caught it all on tape.

I saw this video online a few days ago and was blown away. I didn’t want to believe it but turned out it was true. 

I calmly approached my guy and he admitted it was brother and they don’t have a good relationship. He hinted that it’s very hard for him to date the women he likes (Hispanic) because of this. I don’t believe he has the same tendencies are his brother. 

I felt so bad that he had a brother that would act like that. Thousands of people made this video go viral and it was all over the news here in Texas. 

I really liked the guy before and originally didn’t want to be nonjudgmental but honestly I feel weird about it. 

I’m Hispanic and obviously have had to deal with a ton of racist stuff in the past few years and while I’m very open minded... I feel like the more intelligent side of me is saying to break this relationship off. 

I’m falling in love with this person but don’t want to be associated or possibly marry into a family where the brother is a popular racist. I feel like I’m betraying my heritage even though he wasn’t the one who did it.

bwl485	2019-06-04 05:36:40	DeeplyTroubledSmurf	AITA for not trying to be friendly with my co-worker and boss?	"Context: I work at a small, secure warehouse with one co-worker and a boss. I'm the ""supervisor"" of the other employee. My boss is an alcoholic who only speaks about his girlfriend with animosity. My co-worker is a near-500 pound man who is illiterate and has questionable hygiene. I'm a very happily married, super average guy. I'm usually a people pleaser, and try my best to be likable so things go smoother, but I've completely given up at this job. I should also preface that I go *weeks* without seeing or hearing from my boss, I do most of his daily jobs.


I have nothing in common with them. They're both immature. My co-worker took vacation and my boss failed to show up three of the four days he was gone. ""I needed help for an hour each morning, and you've failed three times"". He came in after everything was done all three days, I couldn't stand to actually look at him, so I left early the last two days once all of the hard labor was over.


My co-worker is incapable of handling most tasks aside from straight labor. Almost half of my job is on the computer, sending reports and dispatching drivers. The labor part of my job is very insignificant. Co-worker spends around half of his day on the forklift moving pallets. He drives the forklift in to a corner of the shop and sleeps. I move pallets by hand because he pretends to have things to do, but I catch him moving the same pallet back and forth multiple times. When he uses the toilet, he leaves a shit stain on the back of seat because his ass is too big. There are just too many things about both of them and this isn't r/offmychest.


I just can't anymore. The drivers seem to like me, but I've made it very known I don't give a shit about my co-worker or boss. I pretend to work alone, usually.


I've started straight ignoring both of them, giving one word answers, and telling my co-worker to shut up. He sings every song so loud I can't hear the actual music, he stops me in the middle of an e-mail to incorrectly read a meme he found on his phone sounding like a first grader reading Shakespeare when he doesn't know what the words mean.


The thing is, I'm happy. Not with them, but I can do this job myself. My home life is great, I've stopped smoking, lost 100 lbs, and I'm in a fairly neutral mood at work which I'm fine with (don't need to be happy all day every day). 


Am I an asshole for pretending they don't exist, and treating them like they don't matter? I don't know how to handle this, because explaining any situation to them always results in my frustration having to explain things to grown men like I would my 6 year old nephew.


Would it be better that I find another job if I can't be nicer to them? Maybe I should prioritize their happiness (they get along well) with mine because 2>1?

bwl36a	2019-06-04 05:32:55		AITA for not paying for my Mum’s online order?	"So I recently visited my mother at her house and she started talking about some $300 bag online that she wanted to buy. I said it might be a good idea to check with Dad first as he is the bread winner in the family but she said it was fine and I thought nothing of it. She then asked me to help her order it, then suddenly at the payment screen she asked me to pay. I immediately got annoyed as she had not asked me at all in the previous 10 minutes when speaking and suddenly expected me to pay. She often does this but usually with cheaper orders and always pays me back in cash, but I explained to her that I have to pay my rent and bills through my online bank and can’t do it through cash. I also don’t have enough to pay for her bag currently, I have spare money in my savings account but if I take money out I don’t get the netbank rewards for keeping it in there. She then asked if she could transfer money to my account and I said that would be fine. She then pointed at her phone and asked me to pay again, I said well no you have to put the money in FIRST. I asked her why she just didn’t want to pay on her own card but she refused. I believe it’s because she and my father share the same account and she gets embarrassed at buying stuff that he can see? I’m not sure. She then got upset at me and was saying that I was being disrespectful and speaking with a rude tone. She also claimed that I said it was too late to put money in my account which I never said and doesn’t even make sense???? Since when is there a time limit on transferring money? I got quite angry at her at this point as I said she was getting upset for no reason and accusing me of stuff she made up in her head. She then left for the shops.
Afterwards I called my dad and told him the situation and as I knew he’d be he was fine with paying for the bag. I decided to snitch so that way he knew my side of the story before she went ahead and complained about me. This is not the first time something like this has happened. 
Anyway I also wonder if i was being an asshole for getting annoyed at her and eventually telling her off once she started calling me disrespectful."		1	0

"So, I have a friend I've known since like 6th grade, he's been one of my best friends ever since, but he's always been... unreliable. Now, in middle and high school this wasn't as big of a deal between class and the seemingly never ending chances to hang

Butttt, I'm graduated from college at this point,  I moved back to my original hometown like halfway across the country, I don't make a lot of money so my time is limited and I only get a couple weeks a year to visit where we all grew up and stuff 

He's constantly over the years agreed to plans o Lynn to back out at the last minute, constantly making those of us who waited up on him to look like idiots, but I thought, hey, adult adults now, he had pretty overbearing parents, will be cool right? Nah. 

I got into town Friday, and he called me (I gave him like a months noti and e so he could plan) and told me the plans for Sunday night (last night) and I was like cool sounds fun can't wait!

All of Sunday I try at various points to contact him without a word, then I notice he's still posting on Instagram stories (he's a semi famous internet 
musician so he posts a lot of fan shit and what not) but he's also with his girlfriend, and tbh, if that's what he wanted to do, more power to him! I just felt v disrespected by the inability to take even 5 seconds to shoot me a text. I've gotten onto him before about this too, I get very little serious answers from him about it. So, I decided to just rip him a new one and basically let him know that if he really wants to hang, he can call me and he can actually show up or let me know if something comes up or he just wants to stay in!! I traveled across cross country and spent money I don't have to see him have a moment in the sun with his music, am I not deserving a single fucking text or something when I've put in so much see him as my brother"		1	0
bwkzce	2019-06-04 05:19:13	Rackbaw	AITA for wanting my gift back?	"So I dated this coworker(I know, I know), for a few months during the winter. Christmas was coming, I’m a handy guy, and she’s conceited. What better gift than a handmade lit vanity? It was perfect. Big mirror, lights all around it exactly like something she’s always wanted. Christmas comes and she’s in love. So proud of her new gift. Then she gives me mine. A nascar driving experience at the Kentucky speedway. Wow. Very expensive and thoughtful gift. I’m a car guy, and this was up my alley. The soonest she could get a date was June. No problem. I can wait. Well, as dating coworkers go, it went south. But we left on decent terms I’d say. 
A few months go by and just checking on the status she asks if I’m still interested in using my gift, I say absolutely! She nods and says she’d still like to go. I said of course, you paid for it! Fast forward a couple more months to today. I get a reminder it’s this weekend. I see her and say, hey that thing is this weekend if you still wanna come watch? She gets quiet and doesn’t say much. 
After work she messages me and tells me I have some nerve for asking about my gift. She tells me she’s passed it on to someone else to enjoy. I say well that’s a bummer, but am I able to get the vanity I built back? (I’ve had a lot of interest in them and have made a few more for others) I’d like to sell it if I can? She says absolutely not and blocks my number. I just feel like if I can’t enjoy the gift you gave me anymore, you shouldn’t enjoy the gift I made you anymore. Am I the asshole?

bwkyf2	2019-06-04 05:15:54		AITA for indulging in my friends behavior when I know I could have helped	"I think the topic name is quite confusing so I’ll try my best to explain the situation. I had a friend who went through a really bad breakup. Or rather a series of bad breakups. Her most recent significant other made her feel like a tool and like usable property. He always wanted her body and blackmailed her with her emotions when she didn’t want to give him what he wanted, then he dumped her when he was done. She took a nosedive from then in terms of attitude, general demeanor and overall grades. She was studying biology as her premed course and she needed above a 3.5 GPA to be competitive in her medical school applications, so the grades part was really important.

She came to me when her grades were dropping initially because I was considered to be pretty smart and she wanted to know if I could help her. Soon after we became really close and she told me everything about her bad breakup and how it messed her esteem and her grades.

After she told me that, I used to give her a lot of compliments and tried to make her more confident. I think she saw this as me flirting and she started flirting back really hard. There’s this thing we did in college where we studied deep into the night in a building reserved for students as a chill spot. On one of those nights when we were studying she really came onto me and let’s just say I got variations of a “happy ending” that night.

She was above average in terms of attractiveness but she had a really big ass and I had this sort of ass fetish, so I continued with the late night reading sessions when we both knew what we were going there to do. I didn’t need to study, but she did, and I knew that, but I was just really horny and didn’t care. 

Eventually I got bored and tried to stop it, but it was too late. She was already talking about how I really helped her esteem and how she wanted to be with me. Stupid me never flat out told her I wasn’t really interested because I wanted to be able to booty call any night I was really horny, and also cause I didn’t want to be like those guys she kept telling me about when I first met her. All while this is going on she barely ever studies.

So final exams come around and she fails terribly while I pass. She needed above a 3.5 but she barely makes it above a 3.0. She can’t get into medical school now while I’ve moved on to the next stage of my life and I lost most contact with her(she changed her number due to embarrassment and I never bothered to look). I walked into her yesterday and while we didn’t talk about anything related to the previous incidents, I could tell she was in shambles. I can’t help feeling like I’m the asshole in this situation.

EDIT: Yes I realize I’m the asshole. I’m not trying to defend myself or make it seem like what I did was justified but I’d just like to clear some things up.

1) Even though she didn’t study, I tried my best to teach and help her understand a lot of things. If I had just told her I wasn’t interested and we should just get back to studying I’m 99 percent sure she would have fallen back into the same state she began with. And I only realized she wasn’t actually paying attention to me teaching when we took practice tests towards the end of the semester.

2) Emphasis on the part where I said I tried to stop it. I didn’t flat out tell her I wasn’t interested but I vehemently tried to avoid anything sexual in nature and tried to actually get some study done. 

I know I’m the asshole but these two things keep coming up in the comments and I’d just like to clarify."	Asshole	0	0

bwkx4x	2019-06-04 05:11:29	mhall54	AITA for making a child cry while cheering for my sister?	"Yesterday was my sister's high school graduation. My family got to the venue about 30 minutes early and waited for the ceremony to begin. There were about 10 of us, because we were all excited to see my sister graduate. A couple minutes later, another family showed up one row in front of us. Most of my family is older and in college or beyond, but the family in front of us had several kids below the age of 10, including a small baby.

The ceremony begins, the principal, salutatorian, and valedictorian all give their speeches, and then each student begins to get called up by name. Now beforehand, the principal told everyone that everyone should hold their applause until all 200+ students graduating were called, but almost no one followed this. After each students name, a select few of each person's family would cheer or whoop. My family decided that we would cheer as loud as we could, because we were proud of my sister and we thought it would be fun. When my sister gets called up, all of us scream and cheer as loud as we could. 

After we sat back down in our seats, the baby begins to cry, most likely because of our loud screams. The mother looked a bit annoyed, and tried to calm the baby down, but the rest of their family just laughed it off. The ceremony goes by without any other disputes, until my cousin who is also graduation is called up. We get up and cheer for her again, maybe not as loud as before, but still loud enough to make the baby cry. This time, the mother was visibly upset, and angrily said ""Stop yelling, you're scaring her!""

As the mother was trying to calm down her daughter, the family's daughter got up to the stage, and the family began to cheer for her. While they were not as loud as we were, they still made a good amount of noise. The mother tried to calm down her baby for a minute, before having to leave the venue because her baby was so loud. The family kept looking back at us after the mother left, acting like we were in the wrong for making her baby cry. So AITA for making her baby cry for just being excited for my sister's graduation?"

bwkx0j	2019-06-04 05:11:06	FinalWorking	AITA for prioritizing my dog over my kids?	"My dog is sick. She (potentially) has some kind of mammary cancer which is starting to develop. No one noticed until I brought her to the vet two days ago and they felt small pea shaped cysts growing on her belly. They've quoted me $1200 to do a biopsy to check whether it's cancerous or not, and if it is, they'll put her on chemo drugs. She's 11 and dogs of her breed tend to last 10-14 years. I keep some money aside for my dog for this express purpose. I've got $500 in a safe in case of emergency, and I don't mind adding the extra $700 out of pocket.

But my fiancee and I share finances. This is money I've always kept aside, even before I met her, so by all rights it's my money. We have a 4 month old daughter who is formula fed. My fiancee doesn't want to pay for the biopsy and instead wants to use the funds (which she didn't even know about until now) on our daughter. She needs formula, diapers, new clothes, an exersaucer, etc. We talk between each other before big financial purchases (over $200) and she says this is one of them and she is vetoing it.

A little context: I work part-time and my fiancee is not working right now to be a SAHM. Her family is rich. Ludicrously rich, but they don't share their wealth and instead keep it in investments. In emergencies, they'll give her some money but otherwise she earns whatever she can and that's it. I argue that I should take money that I earned and use it on my friend (and ostensibly a part of the family) and if we run into trouble, she should ask mommy and daddy for help. They won't help me, but they will help her.

So I did just that. My daughter needs things but I took the money and spent it on my dog. She had surgery today without my fiancee knowing. I played it off as I was hanging out with my friend with the dog. The dog is staying with my friend for now.

Am I the asshole? We aren't strapped now but it does make things harder. I was willing to make this sacrifice for my dog.

**Small update and correction:** the surgery is to remove the cysts and send them for analysis. Whether it's cancerous or not, the cysts are now gone. They said eventually they would become big (whether malignant or benign) and cause pain, and this surgery is preventing that pain and in the case of cancer, may be helping her out, too.

We are not strapped for cash. We collectively have about $6,000 in savings, so the $700 I took is of (relatively) little consequence. My fiancee was against taking any money for the dog, even if we could afford it. Whenever I want to spend something on myself or for our house, it always boils down to ""we might need the money for xyz for our daughter"", even if that never even happens. We will not be going without food or clothes or whatever. There's like a 1% chance this will cause us issues, and if it does, we have bigger things to worry about and her parents could help a little.

FWIW my fiancee hasn't worked in two years. Our pregnancy was planned and she left her employment well before she became pregnant. When she did work, I still contributed about 70% to the household."	Asshole	0	0

bwkw7h	2019-06-04 05:08:14	throwaway100902	WIBTA If I snitched on my friend for smoking weed?	"Throwaway because I know he lurks Reddit.

So I have this somewhat new friend. I like him, he’s pretty chill. And he also happens to smoke weed. I don’t necessarily have a problem with it, even if it’s illegal. I know my country doesn’t care.

The thing is, we’re both highshoolers. We have work to do. And my friend just so happens to smoke a lot more weed than you actually need.

He has a weird family dynamic, where his mum gives him money for groceries because she’s never home. So he’s getting a certain amount of money a week for all his food. But he only gets the bare minimum he needs. The rest he spends on weed. Like $20 a purchase. 

This ultimately leads him to be underfed. Everyday he asks if I have food, to which I reply with “Don’t you buy food?”. He always just says he can’t afford it. I know this is bullshit because he could obviously fit it in his allowance.

I’m just worried he’s addicted. And he has to hang out with shady people to get it. I know, “his body, his rules”, but come on?"	Asshole	0	0

So I was in a group and we were taking pictures. This one girl and I did that pose, and I noticed her face was really oily. Oily makeup is really gross.

She wanted to take more pictures with me, which I was ok with, but I kept moving my face away from hers.

She didn't get the signal, and kept trying to put her touch faces. Eventually, I said ""let's not do that pose. Your face is kind of oily.""

bwksoq	2019-06-04 04:57:00		WIBTA If I pay Somebody to split up My Ex Best-Friend and His GF?	"I’m going to make this as short yet detailed as possible. I know it sounds bad, but hear me out.

So I had this friend, Bryan. Me and Bryan went through a lot together; some really dark times, and some really fun ones. I would have considered him my closest friend. We talked about everything. We had sleepovers and vacations, and celebrated holidays. We went on adventures, and tried new things, ...and we laughed; and we cried. We swore nobody would ever break us apart, and I was sure he would be a part of my life forever. I knew him inside out. We were the very best of friends, and I should probably mention, nothing more. 

Fast forward to January. Last year he went through a lot. He struggles with his own mental health often, and I don’t think he really knows who he is yet. He’s a generally depressed guy, but most times it’s hard to tell, and he isn’t always sad. But he has moments. Well, he started talking to his best friend’s ex. Unusual for even him. But! I tried to support it,  because I supported every relationship he got in, and he was my best friend. I just wanted to see him happy. All of us even hung out together once, although she didn’t say a word and made him leave early.

At first he started becoming kinda distant from me and some other friends of his. Then he started ditching us, ghosting, Etc. I got upset about it and will admit we all had a fight. However, I apologized and I thought we were okay. He ghosted again, and blocked our messages. (not just me) Me and his other friend go to his house and he isn’t there but we tell his brother to let him know we came by. He unblocks me, asks me what were we doing there and to not go back. 

I found a way to send him a very long and thought out letter. Mostly an apology, because I thought he was still mad over the GF situation. Messages blocked. This is when I get suspicious that the GF has his passwords. I send it on instagram. Not blocked, but GF messages and tells me he doesn’t want to talk and to stop messaging. 

We have not talked since. And we have had no direct contact since before they started dating. (February) Since he’s been with her, there hasn’t been a time we talked without me having to go through the GF. She talks for him. So I worry he may not even know some things and she is isolating him. I feel she’s very manipulative and controlling to tear him away from his closest friends. He has mental health issues. He has talked about killing him self in front of me many times. Lately he posts depressing things on facebook, like how he feels alone and has no one, and no one to talk to about anything. I am worried. 

So, I made a post/ad on another social media platform anonymously, stating I will pay someone to split them up. I feel somewhat bad but at the same time I know the only way I will ever have my friend back is if they split up. He isn’t good in relationships anyways and it’s very easy for girls take advantage/use him which I think may be happening. (again.) So, AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

I see them all the time and have built a solid relationship with them. I know what their favourite toys are, and often buy them presents just because.

&#x200B;

The last couple of months, I noticed that the son prefers his sister's toys more. He's more entertained with kitchenette, iron, cooking and other toys that are deemed as feminine. He does play with toy cars from time to time but it's fairly obvious that he enjoys his sister's toys more.

&#x200B;

On his birthday, I bought a much larger cooking set that he can share with his sister (he LOVES sharing his toys with her) My bestfriend never had the issue of him playing with more girly toys but she has mentioned in the past that their dad (her husband) gets very upset whenever their son plays with his sister's toys.

&#x200B;

I bought the cooking set knowing that this may upset my friend's husband but their son really loved it and has thanked me numerous times so I have no regrets. My bestfriend is also fairly ok with this and thanked me for the gift, but I can tell that this may have caused a tension between me and her husband.

So, an unfortunate update has come. I bought Eli all new “heavy duty toys” with the help of his breeder, and bought some sour carpet spray as per recommendation by you guys. And first, I want to thank everyone who commented, he really was getting much better even after only three days. However, yesterday I had to go to a cousins house for her birthday, and my parents, oddly, stayed home. 

When I got home, I noticed the lack of claws skidding across the wooden floor to greet me. My parents were sitting on the couch, fidgeting. The interaction went as follows:

Me: “Hey mom, dad, where’s Eli?” 

Dad: “He’s not here anymore.” 

Me: “What?! Wait, why? Is he okay?” 

Mom: “Honey, it’s gonna be just fine.” 

Dad: “You did your best kid, but he just wasn’t a good dog.” 

Me: “What are you talking about? Did he bite someone?” 

Mom: “We rehomed him. Don’t worry, he lives in a nice house with a huge backyard.” 

At this point, I blanked out. I felt like the walls were closing in. Sure, we had talking about rehoming my puppy, but I at least wanted to say goodbye first. And he was doing better, my dad even said so the day before he was rehomed. 

I can’t really remember what happened next, I have anxiety so this happens fairly often when I get really worked up, but I do remember screaming “This could mess Eli up for his life! You can’t just rehome him, we were bonded!”  and being told to go to my room. I know I could’ve handled the situation more maturely, but they could’ve too. 

And for bonus points: I’m being called an Asshole by my brother for “Stressing my parents out.” Okay, yes, a yelling angsty teenager is stressful, and so is a puppy. But I feel like it’s warranted when you literally give my “Child” away from under me. 

I don’t know if update post are allowed on here or if I have to ask if I’m the asshole again, but I feel like I needed to update anyway. Like I said, thank you for every suggestion y’all gave me. Hopefully the next time I post on either of my accounts will be in happier circumstances."	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

So, my brother (12), is a very exhausting person to be around. He is always wanting attention, whether to look at what he did on Minecraft, or to see how amazing he is. If you don't want to be around him, he throws a tantrum, even if you are busy at the moment. Often, I (17m), get stuck with him. Now, don't get me wrong, he can be fun to be around, just not all the time. Recently, I was working on schoolwork, and he refused to leave me alone. He kept asking me if I was done yet, so we could jump on the trampoline, or play the video games. I kept saying maybe, and told him, if he kept asking, the answer is definitely no. He started to throw a fit of crocodile tears, and went crying to my mom, who told me to stop bullying him. When I do do stuff with him, it is very tiring mentally, though he can still be pretty cool. He never stops talking, and always assumes know what he is actually talking about. And everything has to be done the way he likes it, never anyone else's. We also share a bedroom, and he tries to make conversation late into the night. 

&#x200B;

Recently, I just up and told him no to hanging out, and to stop asking for a while, because I was very busy studying for finals. He started crying and insulting me about all of my insecurities, which I will not mention here. My mom said when I am done being studying that I have to play video games with him, and to stop being an ass. My dad, on the other hand, saw where I came from, and let me be. Last night, at 1200am, he woke me, and started to talk about mundane shit, and I flat out told him to shut up and go the sleep. I heard crying, though I am not sure if it was real or not. He can be kind of manipulative. I told him this morning, that after school I would be in our room studying, and to not bother me, and that I do not want to play with him today. Naturally. there were tears, but I don't care.

&#x200B;

He can be a good kid, but he is kind of annoying. I like the fact that he looks up to me and wants to be with me, but he can just be so damn annoying and doesn't understand boundaries. He is slightly on the autism scale. My mom says that I am the asshole, but my dad and sister say I am not. So AITA for telling him that I don't want to hang out with him."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwkouh	2019-06-04 04:43:49	gothiccelery	AITA for asking my friends not to say retard, but saying it myself constantly?	"autism runs in my family, almost everyone is a little autistic. i’m not severely autistic as if i can’t function on my own, and i don’t look very “autistic” but i have a very hard time reading social cues, learning most subjects, concentrating and i’m VERY sensitive to sounds. usually in public places i have to use noise cancelling headphones to prevent a terrible headache. i’ve been diagnosed with autism.

my family has taught me that the word “retard” is similar to the n word. since i’m autistic they allow me to say it, but they don’t simply because they aren’t autistic.

lots of my friends say “retard” not as an insult but usually as a joke, and they’re sure to never call me a retard. all these kids are around 17-19, so i guess i should be expecting it.

well a week or so ago they were using it over and over and i got tired of it. i told them that it’s very insensitive since it is practically a slur. i told them that i don’t care if they say it, but just please don’t do it around me. they all shrugged and acted fairly cool about it, i could tell their was awkwardness in the air, though. 

a few days after that we were talking about something during lunch, i can’t even recall what it was. i used the word retard when describing someone and that’s when one of my friends pointed out that i asked them not to say it.

“but you see, i am retarded. i am the exact definition of what you’re saying” i replied.

another friend said “but you’re not REALLY autistic, right? you just have some symptoms?”

then the first guy added to that. “you don’t even look autistic, i doubt you are.”

now i got really pissed. growing up looking how i am i get the “you don’t look autistic” thing all the time, and i was so tired of it that i picked up my stuff and left on the spot.

easily you can tell that what they said was an asshole thing to say, i think anyone could see that. 

my question is, is it an asshole thing for me to ask them not to use the word retard around me, but freely say it myself constantly?

TL;DR
i requested for some friends to not use retard, i say it myself all the time as an autistic person. aita?"	Asshole	0	0

bwknhl	2019-06-04 04:39:14	NihilstcWlfShephrd	AITA for quitting a hostile work environment without having a new job already?	"After nearly two years of working with the most unethical, miserable collections of sentient chemicals, I filed reports with HR and leadership to try to do something about it. I lost that gamble and things have now gotten exceedingly bad for me. The retaliation is obvious. 


My spouse asked me to wait until I had secured a new job before I resigned. It’s  been several months. I am trying, I’ve got some leads, but nothing official yet.

This morning I was threatened with more torture and dismissal within the next six weeks. I prefer to leave voluntarily, on my own terms, and as soon as possible now due to this new threat. As in, immediately, not with even a week of notice (constructive dismissal).


My spouse got very angry, yelling ensued, followed by us going to separate rooms for several hours. They tried to come back and talk to me, and that consisted of asking me what was so unbearable. They also said they are worried that it might be a significant amount of time before I get something new. Completely valid, but it felt like they were asking me to justify how angry and depressed I am, and that they don’t have faith in my abilities or trust that I’ll do whatever it takes to take care of us. 


As far as I’m concerned, we could be living in our truck and as long we’re together it’ll be fine. The way they are acting makes it seem like their priority is the finances and the stuff, not the well-being of the person they vowed to love for better or worse.


So, am I the asshole for quitting here and now to get away from this harassment without having a new job secured?

EDIT: haven’t actually quit yet; have 6+ months worth of savings; have strong support network; also, no children, very little debt in general. Spouse and I talk about and share everything, and disagreements of this caliber are rare for us, hence asking if I’m the asshole.


EDIT 2: wow people on here are literal. There are no circumstances in this scenario where we would ACTUALLY end up living in the truck. See above edit about savings and support network. The point of that section was to illustrate that we seem to have different priorities: mine being US, because I know that we can make it though anything together, and theirs being not risking the finances (despite the aforementioned savings, etc.).

UPDATE: well, perhaps instaquitting isn’t the answer. I’m taking some personal days for some distance to help me think clearer. I’m probably going to try talking to a higher-up in HR just give it one more shot, then I’ll give two weeks notice. If they decide they don’t want it and tell me to just go, then that’s on them. Meanwhile, I’m working with my connections to get a good paying position as soon as possible, and will take some stop-gap measures as needed after the two weeks (TaskRabbit, UberEats, etc)."

Ok... so I (24f) am 9 years and 11 years older than my brother and sister, respectively. My relationship with them is complicated to say the least.. 
I love them, deeply though. 
BUT where the AITA part comes in, I am super close to my brother. He's my mini me. He's always kinda been my mini me. He listens to my music, watches my shows, likes to do everything with me. Hes a good kid and I have a feeling we will always be super close. However, my sister... is such a great kid, but we just don't have much of a bond. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE them equally,  and I would honestly die for either of them. But I just am not close with her, and genuinely avoid spending time with her alone. She irritates me to no end and I can only spend a few minutes around her before I get super frustrated. Id blame it on her age (12/13 year olds are awful in general) but Ive pretty much always felt this way. My brother always tags along with me on trips and errands. He even likes to go makeup/ clothes shopping with me. 
I make sure to include her on most things. Im a pretty involved sister and make a point to take them to things like the movies, the zoo, botanical gardens, or just to lunch, pretty regularly. Parents are getting older and just don't do these things, so I make sure the kids get to do more than sit in front of screens. But I still definitely spend significantly more time with him than her. Even just this weekend she got upset because I was going grocery shopping for our mom, and the bro asked to go, but when she asked I said no. I mean he did ask first, and generally taking them both shopping is the literal worst. But it still really hurt her feelings. I genuinely feel bad and never want to hurt her, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  I should also add that shes a nightmare in public. Even at 12 she will just disappear and wont answer her phone, and when she stays with you she will ask for everything under the sun and throw a tantrum when she doesn't get it. Every time I do something with just her I swear I'll never do it again.
In her defense (kinda) she's always been her daddy's princess. She wouldn't know consequences or discipline if they punched her in the face. She's never really been punished ever. 
I also have a very very strained and difficult relationship with their father, my stepfather.  We rarely speak and avoid eachother when I visit. I am aware that my feelings are likely (edit: PARTIALLY) a combination of resentment (she hes a doting father whom I strongly dislike, and also my dad died before she was even born. Also most of my childhood was steeped in poverty and tragedy, whereas she has had a staunchly middle class upbringing) and the fact that my brother was born during a very traumatic time in my life and became almost an anchor for me then. 
But still am I an asshole? Does my almost nonexistant relationship with her make me a bad person?
Edit:
So I think many people misunderstand. I DONT exclude her from the fun outings. I just dont take her on menial errangs because her behavior is unbearable. 
Also, I don't distance her because of her father. I could have worded that better. Her and my brother share a father. Obviously thats not it. Granted, he treats my brother more like he treats me, though not to the same extent. I mean to say that his doting on her and never ever ever holding her accountable has made her often mean, aggressive, manipulative and entitled. She is very difficult to be around. I'm not the only.one who feels that way either. Most of mine and my mom's adult friends avoid her because of this as well. BUT I am not so naive to acknowledge that there are factors beyond her control that may influence or reinforce existing feelings, such as the loss of my father. Also, I don't NOT love her, or care deeply for her,  I just have a bond with him that I don't know that I'll ever share with her.
To put it as succinctly as possible, I LOVE them equally. I just like him more."	Asshole	0	0

bwkjzw	2019-06-04 04:27:28		AITA for not wanting to take my (soon to be) husbands full last name?	"My fiancé is hispanic, has a Mexican mother and a Chilean father. His full legal last name is a hyphenated mix of both their last names, which is pretty common for the culture my fiancé has explained to me. When his mother and father married, his mother never took his fathers last name and kept hers. 

Now i’m just some Canadian white girl, I have one last name. My fiancé has always hated his hyphenated last name but never considered legally changing it to just one as he knew he would offend one of his parents. Although, in his social media profiles (facebook,instagram) his usernames only include his fathers last name, and while signing unimportant papers I’ve seen him only include his fathers last name. 

Him choosing his fathers last name is nothing to do with favourites (in fact he’s a big mamas boy) but he just thinks that his fathers last name suits better with his first name. 

I’ve talked to my fiancé about only taking one of his last names when we married, which he was very much ok with. He was going to keep both of his, but even suggested that if we ever had kids that maybe we would just want to give them one last name as well, as he hated having two last names as a kid. 

I made up my mind to take the fathers last name, nothing to do with favorites again, and technically i’m a lot closer to his mother than his father. But my first name has 3 syllables, where his mothers last name has 2 syllables, and his fathers last name has 3. I prefer having a longer sounding last name than first name and I think the fathers last name just suits better as well. My fiancé has prefers this last name and thinks it would be the one we would also give to our kids, if we ever did have any. 

Last weekend, my fiancé met up with his parents for dinner, and somehow the conversation on only taking his fathers last name must of came up and his mother was FURIOUS. She sent me a large text message claiming I was trying to “erase her” from her son’s and future grandchildren lives and i’m disrespecting the family name. I simply replied back that I would prefer to have a conversation in person about it, and she hasn’t replied. 

For personal reasons, I won’t include the hyphenated last name but the mothers last name is Maya. I have spoke to my husband that I in fact wouldn’t mind naming one of our daughters Maya, as it is a beautiful female first name and may please his mother. He agreed. 

Of course, I wouldn’t tell this to his mother yet, just in case we don’t end up having kids, or just end up having boys, etc. I don’t want to make a promise I can’t keep and start a feud later. 

But i’m curious, is only taking one last name disrespectful? AITA for only taking half of his family name? And especially considering giving our future kids just one last name as well?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

B wrongly accused me of something and while she was already mad at me I called her out on the harassment I'd had to face the past year. Obviously she denied everything.

""I don't remember that, and it really doesn't sound like me. Are you sure it wasn't someone else?""

I basically told her ""That's convenient that you never remember. This is the second time I've called it out & you didn't remember last time either.""

I cut off that friendship.

F and I became very close, best friends. When she started getting very close with B I told her that it really upset me how affectionate/close she was after seeing how she had treated me. I told her my goodbye & I was going to distance myself since I didn't want **any** contact with B. Being in a friendship that was associated w/ so much negativity was not healthy for me. I decided after a mental breakdown how bad this was for me.

She told me that her friendship with B wasn't as important as ours & that she would cut off B. This was her decision.

She said that B didn't deserve to be completely cut off. I advised her that no matter how much line you put out, they can always pull you back in unless you just cut it.

I waited a few months for their gradual separation. There were a couple times I asked F about it & she said that she was working on it. I gave her multiple outs from our friendship - friendship w/ B would cost ours. It was bad for me and our friendship wouldn't survive.

I realized about a week ago that F wasn't going to give up this friendship. F was posting tons of pictures with B, them talking about what they had done together the night before, F encouraging me to 'forgive and forget' but I couldn't do that as I had never received an apology & B still denied it happened. The suggestion was insulting. 

F thinks that B doesn't remember & feels bad so she can't be held responsible for it & deserves our friendship. F thinks that I'm prioritizing a feud over me and F's friendship. F doesn't need my permission to be friends with people. (She's absolutely right, that's not what I was suggesting)

I see it as F should've told me when she decided to stay friends with B so that I could remove myself from this friendship and move on. F is pretty much saying ""I know she has a terrible impact on your mental health but I want to be friends with her knowing how much it'll hurt you"". I'm choosing my mental health over friendship.

bwkhzt	2019-06-04 04:20:55	4dogz2many	AITA for not wanting to lie about resume	"My fiancé has a 15 yr old son and he is applying for his first job. The application process required him to upload a resume. However, his son has zero job experience and does not have much to fill his resume with. 
My fiancé decided to create a resume for him. At first I thought he was just going to show his son how to properly format it and what to list. When I took a look at the finished resume, I was shocked. It consists of job experience that he has never had! Fiancé put that his son helps take care of our multiple dogs, babysits, and works at our snow cone business. We do not have a snow cone business...we talked about setting one up, but it never happened. Also, his son never helps with the dogs. I’m the one who walks them and takes care of their needs. Lastly, his son does not babysit. 
I just feel weird about the whole thing because I found out his son listed me as a reference. What if the company calls me? I’m not sure I feel comfortable lying about these so called jobs and experience. 
WIBTA if I expressed my concern to my fiancé? Or am I being a tight ass about the whole thing? I mean they technically aren’t hurting anyone. I’m torn between talking to my fiancé and just letting this all go."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bwkftd	2019-06-04 04:14:13		AITA for not allowing my girlfriend to have ketchup with her steak?	"I love cooking for my friends and family, and I love it even more when I get requests. 

The other day my girlfriend requested steak - not something I make very often. I made medium rare porterhouse steaks with bearnaise sauce, mashed potatoes and broccoli with a merlot. Simple, perhaps slightly fanicer than usua.

I had a request - mostly as a joke - no ketchup! This was when she said she always had steak with ketchup and preferred them well-done as well.

I know that this combination would be considered a cardinal sin to people who take their meat really seriously, but I'm mostly of the mind that people should enjoy their food however they like and it's not really for me to judge. Thing is... I spent quite a lot of money and went to quite a lot of effort to get this dinner just right, and it doesn't sound like she has had steak any other way in her life. I wouldn't be able to resist feeling a bit offended if I made the requested alterations, because I feel it reduced what I felt was a special dinner to something kinda trashy.

She ate it but she did express she would have enjoyed it more with ketchup.

bwkemg	2019-06-04 04:10:39	krycess	AITA for preferring to wash my own dishes?	"I prefer to wash my own dishes as soon as I am finished using them. 
my grandfather always tells me to put them in the sink so that he can wash them and I always tell him thank you but I prefer to wash them myself so that I don’t accidentally break the habit.
today he became irate after he told me to put the dishes that I just used in the sink before I once again explained that I prefer to wash my own dishes and he gave me a stern lecture about how I need to learn to be a more cooperative team player.
I was shook and told him that I have no words as I left the room.

am I the asshole for not letting him wash my dishes and wanting to wash them myself?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bwke7e	2019-06-04 04:09:21	throwaway100232145	"AITA for blowing up at my mom for ""pressuring"" me to come out"	"Throwaway because family know my actual account.

I'm generally very open about my sexuality with everyone except for my parents. The reason for this is because growing up they were never particularly accepting towards the LGBT+ community. After a very deep (and heated discussion with my parents) they reluctantly decided they would be okay if I came out. However, after this discussion, I still felt like I wasn't ready to come out to them so I brushed it off and told them I was just trying to figure it out. This has led to weeks on end of my mom relentlessly asking me if I'm gay. Sometimes it's straight up, other times she manages to shove it into the conversation, and each time I have told her I'm not interested in talking about it and I'm still just trying to figure it out.

Well today I hung out with a friend of mine and when I got home she was back at it again with asking if I liked this friend and if i was gay. I tried calmly explaining to her that I didn't like it when she would pressure me to come out to her and if she would please stop. She laughed and said she would never stop, she's my mom. I kind of let this anger bubble inside of me for a while and so later when she went to ask me if I was upset I lashed out at her and explained that me coming out was the only thing I had complete control over in my life and she was trying to take that away from me. She got mad and started saying things like, ""I get it, you're always right, I'm always wrong"" and at this point I lost it and blew up about how she didn't understand how terrible it felt to have someone pressure you about something so personal. She keeps telling me that she doesn't understand why I'm so mad and that I'm just overreacting and she was just trying to show me her support. Before I was convinced I was in the right but now I'm not so sure because I know she was just trying to support me but it just felt terrible.

bwkdw9	2019-06-04 04:08:22		Aita for wanting to drop out of wedding?	"The person who asked me to be her bridesmaid asked me after knowing me for 6 months, like the nice person I am, I said yes. I had been in a wedding party before and it was a wonderful experience. I was made fun of by some friends saying I'm just being used to even out numbers. It's odd that she asked me and the bride herself mentioned her groom has too many friends. Fast forward, the bride imposed that we must pay for her out of state bachelorette. I said I wasn't comfortable cause she spends a lot when we go out and I also have many expenses. I'm legit going to use my credit card for this bachelorette. It is out of state and it's a week long. She wants all of her expenses paid for and it wasn't a question..I was backing out as I don't consider I should be the reason for her to not have what she wants, and she assured me she wasn't going to make me pay for all of her expenses. So I was cool paying for as much as I could. Now the trip is happening soon and she took it back. Insulted me and called unpleasant labels I guess to guilt trip me? And said things like "" I don't mean to embarrass you but how can you not afford this trip?""
I am annoyed that it's being imposed on me. I have a  unexpected health expenses that I just found out about and that is what she said to me that she doesn't want to embarrass me. She also said I should have gone out less to save money to pay for her. There's more to is but just the imposition, lack of sensitivity and straight out lie to keep me from backing out that make me feel like a fool and I honestly feel so uncomfortable. I was trying to back out again and she continued reaching out to keep me. I do not think this friendship is salvageable because she thinks she's right and I'm just the worst friend ever. I am deeply offended and she did not apologize about anything she said. Help me, I already invested so much energy and anxiety towards this woman who I do not wish to be around."	Not the A-hole	1	0

bwkdh1	2019-06-04 04:07:08	JustinGoodFun	AITA for telling my dad to cut off my alcoholic brother?	"My dad is a big softy. He’s very generous and carrying. He was a really successful contractor, and his company was growing strongly ...until my brother fucked it all up. My brother was always an abuser. He went beyond indulging, but he was still a functioning member of society. However, the past 4 years he’s gone in the dumps. 

Now he drinks a box of 30 beers a night (minimum), can hardly keep his eyes open most the time, and cant remember anything. He’s full blown acute alcoholic. 

Anyways he works for me dad, and my dad is afraid that if he fires him my brother will go even further off the deep-end. The city my dads company was based in has unanimously decided that they cant hire my dads company because my brother is a huge liability. Since then my dad has relocated to a different city, and tried his best to make it work. He has lost everything, and is in the verge of bankruptcy. My brother has scared away all working talent, killed the companies hardworking culture, and ruined my dads ability to get contracts...but my dad still keeps him around. Then the other day I lost it on my dad at dinner. 

I told my dad that he needs to fire my brother, and let my brother hit rock bottom. That either it happens now, and he saves his company and retirement, or it happens when the company doesn’t exist and they both are at rock bottom. 

Side note: I live far away from family and only visit once a year for a month or so. A lot happens while I’m gone, then I come home and find everything falling apart. Usually I keep my mouth shut. But i can’t anymore."	Not the A-hole	0	0
