c15w1g	2019-06-16 03:56:07	justaonepostacc	WIBTA for refusing to feed my elderly neighbors dog while he’s away?	"Clickbaity title but not entirely false. My neighbor (around 60) is taking a small vacation next weekend and has asked me to feed his dog each morning and night. Now usually I would say yes, I don’t mind feeding the dog and he’s good company to be with. However the dog isn’t being left alone, he’s being left with neighbor’s ~~elderly~~ adult entitled son and he hasn’t asked me to feed his dog because I enjoy it, but because he son has said he doesn’t want to. I don’t feel it’s my responsibility to do chores for him just because his son has thrown a tantrum about it, so WITBA if I just said no?

EDIT: If I say no, entitled son will feed the dog. However might cause tension between neighbor and son."	Asshole	0	0

c15vnh	2019-06-16 03:54:51		AITA for continuing a friendship with A even though I told B I wouldn't?	"A group of my friends and I went on a vacation trip where we rented a house to stay in. During a game night on the trip, my friend Alice lashed out on the group. She had some pent up frustration with her older brother who was there, and some badly timed jokes set her over the edge. She had a 10 on the scale of 1-10 freakout and it ruined the rest of the trip. 


In the car on the way home from the trip, I told my other friend Beth that Alice was really selfish and rude for that and ruined the whole trip for all of us. I tell Beth that I don't plan to be Alice's friend anymore and that I am strongly against what her actions showed in terms of her character, since this had happened once before in a similar context.


Some time pass, and I am now in a situation where Beth keeps telling me she cannot stand the fact that I have forgiven Alice even though I was so aggressive in saying I was never going to hang out with her again and that the friendship was over. I completely understand why Beth would feel this way, since she was the one I confided in when I spoke my feelings about Alice. To Beth, it was like we made a mutual agreement to be rid of Alice's toxic behavior.


But personally, I hate holding onto grudges and I believe that your closest friends are like family, and sometimes family shit just happens but you forgive and move on. 


It is to the point where Beth brings up the situation all the time as an argument to why I am a hypocrite and that I go back on my words. I admit that I am. I am a hypocrite and did go back on my words. But in my personal opinion I did it in favor of showing someone (Alice) that I still loved them, despite their actions that were detrimental to the health of a friendship, and that is different from what Beth tells me were just hollow words and empty phrases.

c15vfg	2019-06-16 03:54:00	thisismylastres0rt	WIBTA if I messed around with my exes friend because she keeps accusing us of being together?	"For some context: last summer i was having sex with a girl (who I ended up dating a bit after) while her bestfriend would send me nudes frequently, knowing full well that I was fucking her friend. GF found out and hasn’t really trusted her since. Now onto the current situation.

I am still friends with my ex. We never ended on bad terms, and I actually enjoy her company a lot, we just aren’t compatible partners. However, I also remained good friends with her friend, let’s call her Z. I guess Z and I are pretty flirty toward each other, but never in front of my ex and she has no way of really knowing. 

My ex and I have agreed to not talk about Z at all, and she doesn’t want to talk to me when I’m with her. Okay, great whatever. But everytime I hangout with Z, my ex always says something passive aggressive, such as “have fun with her”, and I’m really starting to get tired of it. I’m thinking at this point of just proving her right and actually doing intimate things with Z. The chemistry is already there, I’m just wondering if I would be TA for following through with it. 

So reddit, AITA? I can provide more details if needed.

EDIT: My ex and I still do intimate things together. Don’t know if that changes anyone’s opinions.

EDIT 2: Okay yep, I am the asshole. I have decided against doing anything with Z, as I value the friendship between me and my ex. My ex and I talked, and I understand why she is not trusting of us. Thank you all for your input."	Asshole	0	0

c15ujo	2019-06-16 03:51:10		AITA for talking poorly about my coworker?	"So context: I work for a small business that sells cosmetics, and we are paid hourly. I have this coworker who tends to not pull her weight. Whenever we need to ship things, she’ll drop our packages at the post office and come back hours later. She’s on her phone frequently, and doesn’t know how to do most things in the store. She will frequently stand behind me and correct the things I do. For example I was repainting one of the walls and she kept telling me I was missing spots, when I clearly wasn’t finished painting, or telling me I was using the wrong ingredient when I wasn’t. Often our boss will give her simpler tasks to do. One day I made a remark to another coworker about her after she had messed up some of our products. I said “-bad coworker- keeps messing up the products, it just makes more work for me”. 

     Now, I definitely don’t seem like the asshole without more context. She is a single mother with a child she has half custody over, and I believe she has major depressive episodes. She’s also my bosses friend. I believe my boss knows about her being unable to do many things in the store, so I think they maybe have something worked out. I feel bad talking about her, and I probably wouldn’t have if she just didn’t do much at work. But the fact that she tries to correct me in my work, that she doesn’t know how to do, bothers me to a (admittedly irrational) degree."		1	0
c15uhw	2019-06-16 03:51:01	Split_Screen	AITA for ignoring an old friend?	"I thought I saw an old friend while I was out today. He took his own life years ago. But the guy looked so much like him I forgot it for just a split second. Shook me pretty hard. For his family's privacy and such I'll refer to him as T.

T and I grew up in church together. He was a couple years older, but the church was small and there weren't many other kids to play with so we all just hung out. All the kids played basketball or tag or something like that after church while the adults mingled and talked shit about each other in their own little cliques.

I must have been around 8 or 10 when some sort of drama went down with his family and they all stopped coming to church. Over the next couple of years I would hear things here and there about how his family had essentially fallen apart.

Cut to several years ago, T contacts me and we briefly catch up on messenger. We are both heavily into music. We both write and record. I tell him I recently wrapped up recording at a local studio and it would be cool hang out and see if we can write something together. He agrees and that's that. 

A few weeks go by and he reaches out again, just sort of touching base, seeing when we can hang out. I wish I can say I was telling the truth when I told him I was busy. I wasn't even employed at the time. I had literally nothing going on and I blew him off. This happened a couple more times over the course of a few months before I just stopped hearing from him. 

I was sitting on the couch watching some stupid TV show, probably covered in cracker crumbs, when my parents called to tell me that he had been dead for some time before they found his body. My immediate reaction was something like ""...ok? Yeah we weren't close but that's sad"". After I ended the call it took a few minutes but I cried harder than I had in like a decade. Mind you, I don't cry. Ever. Now, years later, I still cry uncontrollably any time I'm reminded of him, which happens pretty frequently.

I realize now he was just trying to reach out for someone, anyone that would give him the time. I should have. I definitely could have. I even said I would but I didn't. My girlfriend says it isn't my fault and I'm not responsible for someone else's actions. That makes perfect sense to me. It's close to what I might say to anyone else in my position. But it doesn't really matter who is at fault or who is responsible does it? If there is a one in a million chance that my friendship would've saved his life, how can I not feel I played a part?

I'm not sure why it affects me like it does. We really weren't close. I'm not looking for validation or attention or whatever other crap I'm sure someone reading this will think. I just want to tell him that he is missed and that he meant something to someone but I can't. I want to know if I deserve to feel like a shit human being and it's just forever a part of my life. I can accept that. I basically already have. If I'm not an asshole, I need to know how and why so I can try to move on."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c15ugs	2019-06-16 03:50:54	Heydudes47	AITA for not wanting to change my hairstyle?	"Alright, my hair grows really fast and thick. My hairstyle is that I get a 3 on the sides and back, and leave a little over and inch on top. I then get a part shaved in on the side, and push my hair away from the part.

c15u5w	2019-06-16 03:49:51	MrSnootybooty	AITA for wanting my SO on our mortgage before she's on the title for the house?	"Obligatory apology for typing this via mobile: 

So last November myself and my family moved into our first ever home (hooray homeownership). In order for us to get the home we had to use my VA Home loan to get it. We originally would have had both of ourselves on the loan but due to my wife's former college loans from 10+ years ago that she was still paying at the time (was told by our realtor that it'd most likely lessen our chances for getting the home with adding her on) we opted for just me on it. 

So fast forward to today: we just got into an argument about her wanting to be on the title. For the past month or so she's been pushing to her to have herself on the title to the house and has been getting things in order for that to happen on her free time. I never explicitly came out and told my concerns at the time simply because I know how I've seen things be talked about as plans actually come up as just ideas at the time and never really were acted upon, but tonight while we we're doing bills she brought it up again- so I expressed my concern that I feel if she wishes to be on the house please let me look into how she can be put on the loan as well, since one of my biggest concerns is financial ruin and I don't want to be solely financially responsible on paper for this house. Instead of understanding she kept pushing me on why I don't want to move forward on this and why it doesn't make sense since she's paying on the home as well. I respond again with the same and she goes off with saying maybe we find separate places to live and have shared time with our child (WTF??!) and stormed up the stairs.

Now by no means do I feel like this is a unreasonable request to ask. After looking into it immediately afterwards she can be put on the loan (she's a vet) and her college loans were forgiven due to her disability percentage so there's no reason why financially she couldn't be put on it. I bring this to her attention a little while later and she still fights for her needing to be put on this house now, because I might die at any point and they'll lose the house plus there's no other time we'll get to do this otherwise we'll, ""have to try to do it the last month before we rotate"" (I'm still active duty; we have 3 years before I have to change locations)

She just stormed out of our room saying ""f*ck this I don't care what happens, f*ck that it doesn't matter, we'll pay however much extra money we have to (if she's on the title we don't pay property taxes due to disability)

AITA for asking that? I'm all onboard with her being on the title AS LONG AS she's on the loan first."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c15r6z	2019-06-16 03:39:31		AITA for asking my disabled sister to not work at my school?	"(throwaway) So for context, I’m 15, and my sister is 21. My sister has a cognitive impairment and so she’s in a special education program. In this special education program, they send their students to job sites, where they learn to work and don’t get paid. This was my sister’s third year. Her disability doesn’t show through. She understands things pretty well and does tasks nicely, so she could get a job right now if she wanted to. 

Second semester rolls around and her new worksite was working as a lunch lady at my school. This really angered me because she expressed that she didn’t really want to go to the program anymore, she doesn’t get paid, and there’s just no point of it if she’s already prepared for getting a job. Being absolutely honest here it’s embarrassing to me because she’s my older sister who’s working a minimum wage job at my school and doesn’t even get paid. If it were an actual job she gets money for I would have been fine, but this doesn’t do anything for her because she doesn’t want to work at a site like this in the future.

So I asked her, “Hey, can you ask your teacher to switch to another jobsite? It makes me very uncomfortable that you’re working at my school and I don’t see the point of you working here anyways if you wanted a job relating to ____ and _____.” 

She says no, and tells my parents. She knew exactly how I felt about it, and even though it’s both sides’ benefit to have her switch, she says no because she wants to embarrass me. My dad agreed with me and said that he doesn’t want her working at the school I go to. My mom said it didn’t matter. She ended up working at my school and I stopped buying lunch. School is over now so the issue is in the past but in the end, I want to know if I was in the wrong for having these feelings.

Cops all over the sides up and down did fuckall, they passed at least 2 that I saw and they didn’t even move. (We were all taking the same route home so my family thought that we should know.) These people were a danger to the road and everyone on it. I saw them coming and blocked them, swerving in front of them. I was honestly so scared I didn’t look back to see if they kept going or if they had fallen. These people weren’t just going a little over the speed limit. The train of family members were talking to each other as it happened, and one person recorded it, they literally fucking zoomed by and they had to have been going at least 120 miles per hour then. I don’t know if they were still going that fast when they got to me (right at the area w the cops who did nothing) but I know they are assholes who could have killed someone.

We just learned my aunt got hit by a car. My guardian (D), my aunts son, was calling around to see where she was. My other guardian (C) asked if she was drinking, she had a smile on her face. My aunt does have a history of DUI's (i don't excuse, i think she should be in jail for them) BUT D 
1) didn't even know her status or hospital just that she was hit
2) Aunt has a breathalyzer in her car form the DUI's, the car will not start if she's impaired. I have told C this a few times when talking about my past abuse.
3) she shouldn't have been smiling when talking about a loved one getting in a wreck.

After D left to let out some anger on no one telling him anything (aunt posted on Facebook but didn't call him, his sister wouldn't pick up, etc) i told her what she said was insensitive especially with her smiling, & she got mad at me saying she just wanted to see how bad it was saying if she was drunk it would've been worse, & giving examples that made no sense-e if she wasn't drunk she'd just be in unstable condition if she got hit head on, but dead if she was drunk.

I was sitting at a different table 10 feet away from MIL and her boyfriend and said “uh huh let’s not do that”.

I am ready to drop it,but now they dragged my wife into it and she thinks I should apologize because what I said was disrespectful cause they are older than me.

Due to Gia and I being the closest in the group, Gia asked all her questions (such as ""When did it to begin"" ""Who else knew"") to me, and having thought that Steffanie confessed, I answered. 6 hours after the confession, Steffanie let us know that someone dared her to do it, so I freaked out because I had already answered Gia's questions. I managed to salavage it though, I convinced Gia that what I said was false information (theres a-whole-nother story for that), and I apologised to Steffanie.

c15lk8	2019-06-16 03:20:47	ChanceAttitude	AITA for not letting my friend store his food at my place?	"Hi there reddit,

I have an issue that’s really been bugging me over the last week and I need the internet’s opinion on the matter. 

So a little bit of background, within my friend group I’m the only single guy. Because of that, a lot of those friends like to hang out with me and at my place. To be fair, I’m a bit of a homebody and I do like hosting so please keep that in mind while reading.

So I have a certain friend that wants to hang with me more than others in the group. However as of late, this friend has been treating my apartment as his personal storage bin. At first, it was him ordering one or two items off Amazon Prime, no big deal. But lately the guy has been ordering multiple bags worth of stuff (last time, three grocery bags full of food was delivered and none of it is usually healthy). While he does buy things such as candles and spray when we hang out occasionally, (we sometimes smoke) I never specially ask for them. Moreso, now he’s been wanting to store this food at my place for the next time we hang out or extended periods of time. While I’ve made it known that I don’t like it, he brushes it aside and I’ve just sucked it up until now because I hate confrontation. However last time we hung out, he had the audacity to get upset at me for giving away sodas he had in the fridge to other guests I had over a previous night. This is the other problem, I usually eat clean for the most part and I try not to stock unhealthy foods in my fridge and pantry. So not only am I storing his food, but I’m also tempted to eat/drink all the garbage he brings into my home (which to be clear I’m no saint, I have eaten ONE pizza he left but it was in my freezer for a week). I will say this though, while I don’t want him keeping stuff in my apartment, I would never not tell any of friends to not bring food/drink they want to consume IF they finish it or take back leftovers with them. So with these details in mind, AITA?

"okay, so this happened  a couple minutes ago, My dad and my little brother just left for what my little brother called "" a fun secret mystery."" I asked them where they were going and My dad just repeatedly shut me down by saying: ""DO your chore"" or: "" you know what, it doesn't matter because you need to do your chore"" 

now, my chore only takes about 5 min, so I thought I could do it then we could all leave, but apparently not, He continued to shut down my ideas and told me to go inside and do my chore. Now I consider this to be sorta jerkish, so I was just wondering:

Is my dad the Asshole for doing this?

c15k53	2019-06-16 03:16:10		AITA for asking my boyfriend (that I live with) to leave the room while I change?	"TLDR: AITA? Is it weird to ask your boyfriend that you live with to leave the room while you change? I know you guys will be aggressively honest with me.

I (25F) have a huge test tomorrow that I've been studying for weeks so today was supposed to be a day of relaxing and not stressing anymore. My boyfriend (24M) and I were going to spend time together and go play mini golf. I've been stressed and anxious and it has made me even more self conscious so when I got out of the shower I asked him to go in the other room so I could change. This started a huge fight. He was pissed about me wanting him to leave the room and said I'm pushing him away. He wanted to know ""what's going on with me"". I told him I'm stressed about school and boards and I wanted some privacy to change and that I'm embarrassed right now. He says he's not even looking and I should just change. He eventually does leave the room for me to change, but is visibly unhappy about it and keeps saying he doesn't understand. We drive to mini golf and he doesn't say a word and just has a pissed look on his face the whole drive. We play mini golf and he probably says 2 words to me. We get home and I let him go in and I go shopping because it was my mission to relax the day before the test. I get home and he still won't speak to me and avoids eye contact the rest of the night. I was going to study some this evening to keep everything fresh in my mind, but couldn't focus because you could literally feel the hostility in the room. We start to go to bed and I can tell I won't be able to sleep for hours so I go in the other room and start to review. Now he won't leave me alone. He keeps telling me it's 10 o'clock at night and I don't need to study now and I'm going to be tired tomorrow and won't stop standing beside me just looking at me. I tell him ""you haven't wanted to talk to me all day why won't you leave me alone and let me study now?"" So he leaves and starts packing his bag for work and leaves the house to sleep in his truck. He said he wanted to have an adult conversation today about me wanting him to leave the room and that we didn't so he just gave me space today. He told me to ask my friends if wanting my boyfriend of 2.5 years to leave the room for me to change is weird. I can't ask my school friends that so now I'm asking you guys. Is that weird? Am I an asshole? I'm exhausted now and still need to study so I'll probably be reading this tomorrow evening after the test."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c15jwk	2019-06-16 03:15:17	AllHailMegatron8	WIBTA if I ever told my dad that I hate him at any time? (Not tommrow)	"I'm asking this since I feel like I'm justified in how I feel but my mom isn't sure. She isn't outwardly saying I'm a A-Hole but that I shouldn't say it.

Some context. My father is a hard working blue collar man, who up until 2 years ago was my hero. 

My father came from a very poor up bringing, middle child of 7 kids, raised by a single mother, and had a asshole father who he doesn't speak about.

That being said he had always said he would never become his father. 

But he has.

My parents have had some spats and he's acted irrational about one of them involving a friend of mine who my mom taught to drive. (He was 20 and never got his liscence so my mom taught him.) My mom became friends with my friend and we would all just sit around and talk. But my dad acts really but hurt about this like my mom betrayed him in someway. 

My mom never did anything but talk to my friend like you would a friend when you need to talk about life. Nothing inappropriate at all. And my dad got upset about nothing if you ask me.

It got worse

In 2017 the whole family was cleaning house until myself and my brother hear my dad screaming at my mother. Myself (22 at the time) and my (13 year old) younger brother walk into a scene I can't forget.

Dad was screaming at my mother demanding he wanted a divorce and saying how he is tired of being the only one working. (My mom had to quit a month prior due to health issues.)

I scream at him to stop it. Than he turns his attention onto me and my brother saying how he's sick of how lazy we are and how we don't do anything in the house, and how dissapointed he is in us, and how were freeloaders. And how we do nothing to make him happy. 

I clean, cook, take care of the animals, and do everyones laundry. 

My brother has done all the yard work with him.

To be honest that's not why I'm so hurt. But how he said it is what really hurt. He had basically said how it's because of us he's not happy.

He basically said he wished we didn't exist.

The rest of that day was just a blur from my heart breaking.

This was the man who had helped made me. 

Who saved my life when I was in the deep end of a public pool when I was 4.

The man who was my gaming buddy.

All that didn't matter to him?

We meant nothing to him? 

What I do remember is grabbing my car keys and my brother and just driving to a parking lot to hide.

We were inconsolable. After what felt like hours our dad came by to get us. He apologized for what he said.

But I didn't believe him. I still don't believe he really was sorry.

He's still an a-hole . And he constantly treats my mom like crap.

My mom got hurt in a accident recently having a lot of broken bones. He may have been at the hospital all the time. But now he just treats her like shit and screams at her about crap.

I don't love my father anymore. I hate him.....

c15jkw	2019-06-16 03:14:13	aitaquestion12344	AITA for being upset at this childcare situation?	"TL; DR: My wife and I entered into a childcare agreement with my brother for the summer. He’s been getting off work early but letting his wife pick up their child 90+ minutes later. Wondering if IATA for being upset with my brother.

I am in a career that gives me June and July off, and I’m married and have a 3 year-old son. My brother, who is a couple years older than me, is married and has a 4 year-old son. His wife and he both work full time 8-to-5 jobs. Before summer started, we talked about the topic of childcare. They needed summer childcare during the week, and they estimated it’d cost $1000/month. Since I was staying home with my child anyway, we came to an agreement where they would pay us $400/month to watch their son. The basic agreement/understanding was that I’d watch their son from breakfast time until either my brother or his wife got off work, and then they’d pick him up. 

My brother’s wife works until ~5:15 pm daily. Lately, my brother’s schedule has become more flexible. Sometimes he’ll work till 5 pm, but there are other days where he’s done as early as 2 or 3 pm. He really enjoys bowling, and in the past, I know he’s asked his wife to pick up their son from their previous day care because he’s gotten off work early and has decided to go bowling. It’s easy to tell when my brother is off work, because he parks his work truck in his driveway and uses his personal car. 

A couple times over the past two weeks, I’ve taken the kids grocery shopping in the afternoon, and when I’ve passed his house on the way home (as early as 3:30 pm), his work truck has been in his driveway. One of these times, I called to ask if I should just drop his son off, and he claimed he was also out running errands. As I was talking with him, I thought I heard a bowling ball hitting pins in the background. This is when I started to get frustrated, and I’ve been going back and forth about whether my frustration is justified. I have a feeling this is happening at least 2-3 times per week.

My brother has helped me out quite a few times in the past, and I know he’s paying me, too. I just have this feeling in the back of mind that I’m being taken advantage of. The money he’s paying us is much less than what he’d be paying for day care, so I think it’d be reasonable for him to pick up his son as soon as he gets off work rather than going bowling while I’m watching his son. Another thing is that since I would be watching my own son anyway, it’s not like his son is keeping me from engaging in my own hobbies. However, if his wife has to pick their son up, she doesn’t arrive until after 5, so I’m watching their child for at least an extra 45 minutes.

c15jig	2019-06-16 03:14:02		"AITA for saying, ""I would hate to be woman.""?"	"This post is completely contradicting my mindset but I'm tired from jet lag.

I'll try to be brief, I was with my friends and they are all female. They seem to enjoy my company and feelings are mutual. And well, we were just hanging out on the beach talking; kept circulating questions and thoughts. One asked me,""If you were suddenly a woman, what would you want to do?"" to which I instantly shut down by saying 'I would hate to be a woman' (I definitely said more but that's mainly what I spoke). 

Yeah well, she instantly got aggressive asking me all these reasons why. Everytime I listed an answer she went into defensive lockdown trying to vindicate every facet of womanhood. In the end, she called me an asshole and 'I ruined our relationship'. I honestly don't know what my other friends thought but I'm just hoping they understand what I was saying. I don't think I was sexist, I simply told her my opinions as bluntly as possible. But I'll be happy to provide info if necessary.

I tried stripping this of any bias but I feel like I need to say how much being a man means to me. I genuinely love being a man, I love my personality, my body; I embrace it. And frankly, I don't give a shit if I'm the asshole or not. I just want to know if I was the asshole in this ""situation"". Enlighten me."	Asshole	1	0

I will be finishing my master’s in December, and have been working at a retail store for about a year now part-time so I was making some money while in school. I was just offered a job that can finally allow me to be financially independent, but there’s a tiny problem. This job wants me to start training next week, and therefore I will possibly have to only give a 1 week notice to my part-time job. I asked what times training was so I could possibly work around it and stay the two weeks at my part time job. I would have just told the new job I couldn’t start for two weeks, but another problem is that I have a vacation scheduled in the middle of July too, and had to mention that, and didn’t want to seem like I was asking for too much too soon. I just feel like an ass because I do care about the people I work with and it’s a small company with very few workers working in that store.  

The only thing that makes me feel a little bit better about it is that my boss just told me that the budget is being cut and that one of us might have to be let go, so it’s not like they need me terribly bad. Like I said, I just like these people and don’t want them to hate me forever now, lol

When I got there his grandma was ecstatic to see me and let me inside and brought me to his room. Not that long later, she came in and gave me $10 for gas, as it was a 40 minute drive to get there and I'm a college student. She then later offered to pay for my gas and movie ticket and movie concessions if in the future we wanted to go to the theater. I felt kind of bad taking it, and still do. Especially since I'm sure a part of why she did it is because he has a disability and depression and I dont think he has many friends over.

c15hqf	2019-06-16 03:08:03	chaoticneutralhobbit	WIBTA for telling people I can’t have kids instead of saying I don’t ever want kids?	"This is a hypothetical at the moment. I’m not married, but I am engaged. The wedding won’t be for another 3 years, for general life reasons. Even if we wanted kids, it’s not in the cards for at least 5 years.

My fiancé and I don’t want kids. There’s no reason, really. We just don’t want to be parents. We usually don’t mind telling people that but here’s the issue. My fiancé is a Southern Baptist pastor at a little church in the Deep South. His whole family is also conservative Christian, with a lot of children in all branches of the extended family. I say all this because, if you didn’t know, babies and reproducing are *huge* in the Christian church, and even just the South. Our church is 95% grandmas and grandpas who had a lot of kids, and now want grandkids and all of my fiancé’s cousins are popping out child after child. 

Even though I literally just graduated college a month ago, and he’s not graduating until the fall, everyone seems to be a little baby crazy already. I hear “when you have kids” or a variation of it pretty much at least once a month or more, and I know for a fact that those comments will ramp up to 1000x as soon as we walk into the wedding reception. We’ll be hounded by the church to have children immediately.

While we love our congregation and where we’re at, there’s no way we can tell the church we don’t want children, because of the culture there. They just... wouldn’t accept it, if not be devastated. There are no children coming to the church regularly, and many of them don’t see their grandchildren often or have any. So I know they’re all hoping that this young pastor and his wife will fill the church with babies. 

His parents don’t seem to want to accept it either, but they leave it alone at the moment. But even my own mom, who isn’t religious, says I have to have kids since it’s “something every woman should experience”. So the plan is, after a year or two, to tell people we have tried but turns out I can’t have children.

But I’m here because I’m not sure if that’s okay. It’s a really easy fix to the issue. People likely won’t bother us about it again, beyond saying we should adopt or try IVF or whatever, to which we’ll answer that we feel like it’s God’s plan for us not to have kids (which is true regardless, actually). I also feel like it’s a lot kinder for the people around us who want to help raise our children one day. Instead of us not wanting them, it’s that we can’t have them. But on the other hand, I feel like I’m exploiting something that is deeply painful for a lot of women, for our convenience. We would never tell anyone the truth, so no one would find out but still. It’s the principle of the matter in my mind. 

Like i said, this is hypothetical, so try not to rip me apart. Our lives could change drastically before we’re even married. But I was curious what other people think. WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c15hk7	2019-06-16 03:07:27	roseparades	WIBTA if I asked my fiancé to contribute a bigger share of the rent?	My fiancé makes significantly more money than I do  and currently we each pay for half of our rent. I have student loans and he doesn't, so after paying for those as well as my share of the rent and utilities I'm left with almost nothing, and I have no savings whatsoever. For him, his share of the rent is less than 10% of his monthly income, while it is nearly 30% of mine. However, because of the nature of his job, he goes away for two weeks at a time and then comes home for one week, so he's at the apartment for way less time than I am; while he's at work though, he has no expenses at all, as his laundry, meals and housing are all paid for by the company. I'm struggling a lot and it's been very stressful for me, but at the end of the day he's not in the apartment as much as I am, and it's his money and he works hard for it, so would I be the asshole if I asked him to pay for a bigger share of the rent since he's more financially stable?

c15gc7	2019-06-16 03:03:18	Cherinnb	AITA for suggesting one of my neighbors come home to care for their dogs while their baby is recovering after surgery?	"My neighbors were at the hospital while their baby was recovering from surgery. The wife stayed the whole time and the husband would head there every night after work. They made prior arrangements with a friend to look after their dogs, but when he stopped showing up the wife asked if I could let the dogs out and feed them. My husband and I helped as much as we could, but because one of the dogs was kept in a cage (as requested) she was constantly living in her own feces and urine anytime she was indoors, and the other dog was using the kitchen floor as a bathroom. My husband helped clean when he could, but neither one of us had time to fully care for these dogs or let them outside as much as was needed. I kept in contact with the wife via text and let her know how bad things were getting without a full-time caretaker, so the husband eventually came home for a night to care for them. He made it clear to me that his wife was giving him a hard time about being home and then headed back to the hospital the next morning. After helping out a few more days, I had to let the wife know we were unable to help any longer, because we don't own a washer and dryer, and after several days of getting covered in urine and feces we were down to our last clean clothes and couldn't afford to go to the laundromat until payday. I was a little frustrated because these poor dogs were suffering, and we couldn't provide the care they needed, so I gently suggested that maybe her husband could come home every other night to care for them, and she could give him a call if there was an emergency with their baby. I told her I completely understood them both wanting to be there, but that things were bad enough that they may need to make an exception for the sake of their dogs. And at this point, their baby had been in recovery for a week and was doing well as far as I'd heard. Anyway, they ended up finding another friend to let the dogs out (once a day) and came home a couple days later. Once they were home, I noticed the wife wasn't being very friendly towards me and wasn't speaking to me at. In fact, she's been acting like I don't exist. My husband ended up finding out that she was mad at me for saying specifically, ""you guys don't BOTH need to be at the hospital"" which is NOT what I said at all. I've been somewhat baffled by her reaction since I thought we'd all become pretty good friends the last year, and I really was trying to be sensitive to her situation. Aside from the fact that she completely twisted my words around, am I an asshole for suggesting they may need to have her husband come home to care for the dogs occasionally? I should also mention that he had absolutely no issue coming home to care for them. She was the only one that had an issue with it, and that similar things have happened while they're just on vacation (dogs living in filth.) So, do I need to apologize here? I showed my husband our texts as well and he was just as surprised as I was by her reaction and surprised by how much she twisted my words.

Part 2:

He called someone who I considered my best friend and whose husband I am close with as well. Both are in the health care field, a nurse and a doctor. The wife, whom I considered a best friend calmed me down along with my brother. However they deemed it necessary to make me go to the ER. I did and they released me when they determined I was not a hazard to myself or others...a few hours later and after consulting with my shrink. 

Part 3: I was out of town for a few days, a week later. It helped my clear my head. I spoke with my psychiatrist and my therapist about how my emotions control me but it's a product of my condition and it's never about harming others, it's about unburdening others with my presence.

Part 4:

Last week I was trying to arrange a get together with the person whom I had considered a best friend. Lo and behold, they (husband and wife) had decided I was an immediate threat to their family and I was too much of a burden. I only found this out because I realized I was being avoided and sent a string of texts and finally an email apologizing for my selfish behavior. I got one response that boiled down to, you are a threat and stay away.

c15ft0	2019-06-16 03:01:36		AITA For Yelling At My Brother About His Dogs After His Cancer Diagnosis	"Hi all,

I've been struggling with this. My older brother was just diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. He's been given less than a year to live and this has hurt my entire family. He was the brother that introduced me to the music I know today. I wouldn't be who I am without him. We aren't as close anymore because he lives 8 hours away. We talk through Facebook and text but that's about it.

I understand this diagnosis has been hard on him. He barely eats and sleeps all the time. He lives in an old house that belonged to my grandma. He and his wife live there rent free.

My dad called me a few days ago almost in tears. He said he went to the house and it was destroyed. Dishes piled up, dog shit on the floors, and that the three dogs they have were almost dead. He told me one of them couldn't stand and he had to feed and help him. The other two were bad off but he helped them with food and water. I was livid.

I called my brother and told him just because he's dying doesn't mean he can take innocent animals with him. He hung on me and made it clear I will never understand what he's going through. I understand but not feeding his dogs because of this is no excuse. He refuses to speak to me because I plan to call animal control on him.

My sister says I'm not understanding his pain but I do. I understand he is dying and I hurt too. This is no excuse for the animals. I keep thinking maybe I was too harsh with what I said. I can't imagine the pain of dying but those dogs worry me. My sister says it seems like I care about the dogs more than brother.

He is home now and resting. However, he hates his cone, hates his crate, and constantly squeals for one of us to be in the room with him. I was with him the last two days, non stop. Giving meds, giving love, and trying to juggle full time school work and keeping my house in order. My fiancé comes home this evening and becomes increasingly agitated at his squealing. I told him to just give him some attention and be with him while I catch up on some house work, like laundry. Eventually, he gave up on giving him attention and decided to go outside and hangout on the back porch to grill something for dinner. I got upset and bitched at him about not helping. He burnt the pork chops that we were having and completely flipped out. Yelling at me that he is just a dog and dogs whine. He’s had about enough of all of this. He goes into the bedroom and shut and locks the door. He texts me and tells me to sleep on the couch tonight with the dog and that i can be an overbearing bitch sometimes. I know that I pushed him to the edge tonight but I honestly did not mean to. My anxiety has hit a whole new level tonight with all of the stress going on. I was worried our dog was going to die the last few days. He literally has been such a huge emotional support for me, since losing my mom last year. He saved my life, pulled me out of this grief ridden hole that I dug. I just couldn’t bear to lose him. 

I guess my question is, am I an overbearing asshole?who needs to chill out?

I'd rather spend my birthday alone and doing stuff that makes me comfortable and at peace than sitting through lunch making small talk while my mind would obviously be elsewhere. 

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole for saying no? They know I'm in town alone and they're definitely trying to be nice inviting me out to lunch with them. But I really don't want to go. He's a good friend and his family is great but this hike is something I really want to do."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Everytime we go on a ""vacation"" she yells at everyone and defensive about everything, it's more stressful to go somewhere than if we were to just stay home. She told me the reason she wants to go is because my birthday last year was horrible. Long story short, I made joke about her  boyfriend (who smoked crystal meth in our garage the same day) not liking red velvet cake (my favorite and a birthday tradition in our house) and he screamed at me and wouldn't stop. Some other stuff happened too, but that was the worst. For the past few days, she and my grandma have been talking about a vacation in the near future. Today however, me mom said,""So what all are we going to do on your birthday trip?"". We discussed going somewhere for my birthday about a month ago, and I told her I didn't want to go anywhere and she said we wouldn't. When I told her what what she previously said about it, she claimed I never told her I didn't want to go. She has a chronic illness and sometimes forgets things, maybe due to her medicine? I'm just sick and tired of being called a bitch and told to shut up for disagreeing with her. I really do appreciate the sentiment, but I'm trying to better my mental health which hasn't been easy and I don't think I can deal with any more stress."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Stay away, don't die like I will. Anyway, we had a family cookout and after many drinks one of my uncles asked if I still smoked. I said Yes. Trying to quit but still yes. He asked if he could secretly have a cigarette. On the way out another uncle noticed and asked if he could have one as well. (in the past I have given cigarettes to both of them previously). I obliged. We smoked and had a drink. About 20 mins later one wife noticed her husband smelled like smoke and was pissed at him and other uncles wife then noticed the same. They were kinda mad at them and said I shouldn't have let them smoke with me. I'm probably the AH here but I mean they asked me... How does Free Will Work? Is it my fault? Should I have Refused them?

c15ca1	2019-06-16 02:49:50	Lieutenant_Buzzkill	AITA for asking for my money back from the sale of a broken controller?	"I just graduated high school, other guy is going to be a sophomore in the fall if that matters. 

I play video games a lot, so naturally the controller would get worn down eventually. Mine had a joystick come loose seemingly out of nowhere and it's basically unusable now. 

So I posted on my Instagram story and said ""Hey, anyone have an Xbox One remote I could buy?"" And a kid who I met through theater responds and says that his brother has one. We agree on the price point of $35. New remotes go for 50 or 60 bucks, so I figured it was a good deal. 

I had been using a remote a separate friend let me borrow, and about 45 minutes ago I plug in the one I bought and try to play some Call of Duty. As soon as I get into the match, my character's vision immediately goes up to the sky. Apparently, this remote is busted too. I played a couple more matches to make sure and yup, it's broken too. 

So I text the guy and say ""yo the remote's kinda busted."" He reads it and doesn't respond. I send another text that says ""yeah I just played a match and this thing is basically unusable in a competitive game so i kinda want my money back cuz I feel like i got ripped off ngl."" And he read it and didn't reply. I told a mutual friend and he said I was too hasty to ask for my money back and that he couldn't have known. But since this guy plays primarily Fortnite and COD, he has to have known. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting my money back?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So for background about 5 years ago I met my husband L while he was on a extended business trip through some mutal friends and we really hit it off. We spent a big portion of our relationship in the us and a smaller part long distance while he was back in Russia. Long story short I ended up moving to Russia to live there with him after we got married in the states. We're back in us for a while for his work and probably will be for a few years. We're planning on starting our family and while talking to my mom about plans for baby names and such I mentioned we had picked out a girl name and a boy name, Lyubov and Alyosha. These aren't just randomly picked but after people important to us on his side of the family. My mother was very upset saying that my kids were going to be made fun of and I was setting them up for failure. She was more upset when I told her me and my husband are planning on only speaking Russian in the home if we have children while here (unless of course my family or friends visit). She said its like we're trying to make life as hard as possible on our future kids. Our reasoning was 1. If we moved back to Russia eventually (which we are planning on after a few years) the transition on our kid will be easier if they have ""normal"" names and already speak the language (plus learning Russian was one of the hardest things ive done and I don't want to lose it from misuse). 2. If we stay in the us for a longer time or dont go back they'll have ties to their heritage and be able to put having a second language down on a resume. We figure they'll learn English in school and I've heard kids will reject a language unless they have to use it like the only media in the home/having someone who doesn't speak English.
I get my mom's points about it being hard on the future kids but I thought hopefully they might be greatful when they're old enough
So reddit am I the asshole for wanting to give my kids Russian names and making their first language Russian?
(Also the throw away name is a reference to my grandma saying our kids will sound like commies lol)

EDIT: so just from reading the comments I think its important to note there is a very small chance of us staying in the us past the kid turning 3 and the child most likely won't even end up being born here. My mother just also doesn't like the idea of them having very Russian names even though it's a 99% chance they will be growing up there and having English names would be weirder."	No A-holes here	0	0
c15bkz	2019-06-16 02:47:25	xiaomein	AITA for getting mad at my SO for bad business.	"For context, we just finished finals and were now in summer. Because of housing rules if you're not using the space you still have to pay for it. She doesn't have that much money so she chose to sublease her place which is a single bedroom. She's in China right now so I've been helping her once I was done with my finals.

 We haven't been having good luck but I know we would've gotten one because I subleased mine for around 750 a month. But without telling me, I guess she got desperate last night and she agreed a deal to sublease the place for 600 for 2 Whole Months so 300 each month including utilities internet and parking.
I got mad and I said doing that is dumb. And I got annoyed at the fact she did this without telling me. I think I got mad for how low she sold it for and the fact she didn't tell me. 

Thinking over it, I wonder if I was wrong to get mad at her for this. I'm a pretty frugal person as well so I'm wondering if my reaction was unjustified.

c15av5	2019-06-16 02:45:05	VoxieBoy	AITA for not wanting to be around my partner while he's drunk?	"(in this story we will call my partner/companion Q.)

My partners family has a history of alcoholism. His parents were completly incompatible unless they were at a bar drinking. Q would regularly have to pick his parents up in the evenings because they were completely smashed. To top it all off Q's mother was crazily abusive towards him. She would regularly gaslight him and say horribly manipulative/mean things that really messed with his self image. You would think after having all these bad experiences with the brew growing up he would stay away from it like the plague. Unfortunatly that's not how he's reacted.

At the beginning of current year Q moved in with my family to get away from said abusive mother. Where he previously lived he was aloud to drink whenever he wanted and regularly did so to cope (even though he was underage). My father has a strick no underage drinking policy. Since he moved in Q has had to be dried out up until this last month when he turned 21. Before his drinking was managble. I could buy him a beer every now and then and be prepared to deal with his drunk self. Now he drinks every day he's off work and I have no choice when I get to come home to a drunk idiot I have to take care of.

This is probably tmi but when Q is drunk he gets A. really horny and B. Really insecure about being loved. I generally don't like being around drunk people because of my own experiences with alcoholics in my childhood.

Today I came home for lunch and Q's drinking pattern had repeated itself. There he was completely drunk off one Stella because he has been sober for mouths beforehand. 

Naturally I was put off because I was going back out in one hour and didn't want to deal with this. I just said hi and tried to leave to go spend time alone in my room.

This triggerd his worries about being unloved. He was all cheery at first but when I went to leave he whined about me not giving him enough attention.

I thought that was rich because I spend every waking moment I can with this bloke. He's the one who regularly needs alone time to recharge.

I went to spend my time alone. Then I said goodbye to Q before I left.

He asked me what he had to do to get me to spend time with him (It was his attempt at seducing me but I ignored it).

I told him to ""stop drinking so much. It makes you annoying"".

He said ""I'm not an alcoholic"". Not the point I was bringing up.

I told him ""That's what alcoholics say"" and mention he's been drinking every day he's off.

This made him freak out and he ran into the bathroom and started crying loudly.

I said to him ""I'm sorry I have to go. I love you."" I felt bad about not being able to comfort him.

As I was walking out I heard Q sob ""Please love me!!!"".

Now I'm just here thinking ""I do love you but I'm not going to spend time with you if you're going to make yourself horrible to be around"".

I was not gonna make the mistake of letting him back in, so I lied and said he has the wrong number. His response after that? He replied with ‘no problem child later’. First of all, it’s been almost 2 years , he doesn’t know me anymore. I didn’t reply after that because why would I? Am i the asshole considering we were close at one point and people can change?

c159yr	2019-06-16 02:42:09	100outof10	AITA for getting back on my sister, whose treating better than before?	"Obligatory English is not my mother tongue.

My sister is older than me by three years, and she used to treat me like absolute shit. In our teenage years, where kids were the most sensitive, she called me things that gave me insecurities to this day. I'm a chubby person, and she has called me ""a fat cunt"" since I was 12. I train for two hours around 2 times a week for a labour-intensive sport, and I'm slowly dropping the numbers. My confidence is coming back up. The last time we argued and she called me ""a fat cunt"", I was hurt still, but I told her I wasn't insecure about it anymore, and she retorts with ""You should be"". Set me back to ground zero. Whenever I bring this up to her in a regular conversation, she would reply with ""but I don't do that anymore!"" like it solves it. She does the same with ""You have no friends"" ""You are terrible with people/with socializing"" ""You have shit grammar"" (or just correcting my grammar in general, we grew up in a country with English being our second language, with her being older, she was much better at English when we moved to Canada) and all have that gave me lasting scars because of how true they were, and how much I loved her. She has played very sick jokes on me that threw me into a complete panic attack, which I ended up calling my friend, crying through the entire phone call, calling kids help phone right after, and being very close to dialling 911. There were also forms of physical abuse, but there are some things I won't say because I'd breakdown again if I had to.

That doesn't do her terribleness justice, but I'll leave it at that. Time for my asshole-ness. Now I would find everything I know she's insecure about: terrible grades, unstable relationships, failing her driver's license, and poke fun at it. Today I found her crying in our younger brother's bedroom(whom we both love and fight over) because of something shitty I did today. She has been treating me better recently, but I can't forget what she had done to me. She told me she had depression, ADHD, and anxiety. She hasn't been diagnosed but she is very sure of it. On my side, I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Social Anxiety. But she mocks me constantly for it, and has even gone to screaming at me in a restaurant for being unable to get our server to come and saying I was just ""being lazy"". At this point, I don't know if I still have any love for her left. The main reason she is upset is that she is treating me ""well"", by letting me sit at the same table as her, by helping with school, etc. She would always be insulting me the whole time, but help is help, and her acts of kindness are still there. She acts like this couple of month of niceness can cover up my trauma, and that if I'm mean to her in ANY way, I'm a shitty person. I'm beginning to feel like I am. She's treating me like I used to treat her but worse, and I'm treating her like she treated me just without the physical abuse. She has written me notes about being sorry, before, for context."

c159v0	2019-06-16 02:41:51	Graylorde	AITA for joining social events, but not participating enough?	"I am a very introvert person, but I work ln a very socially competitive field (as an on-the-floor salesperson) and I've worked there long enough to where I consider several of my colleagues close friends.

We try to occasionally celebrate salary days, special holidays and other events.
I struggle a lot with various energy related issues that contribute a lot to my introvert nature (I'm still getting tested for cfs, but it's a long process when done thoroughly) so when I do go out, I legitimately want to go out with people I truly appreciate with the mindset of wanting to celebrate and have a good time.

 So once things get going i'm not exactly the first person to show off on the dancefloor, but once the group has a good time and everybody is loosening up, I'll join in. But occasionally people expect a lot more.

So what triggered me today is that a colleague of mine decided to bring a friend of his to our celebration because to paraphrase: ""kickstart the mood, since he's such a party guy.""

We got a couple of drinks, had fun, danced etc.

He started out as playfully active and fun, but once we got into an expensive venue and more alcohol got involved, I started to experience him more as a bully, he kept pushing us to play along and do things how he wanted, and drank everyone else's drink when they weren't present (despite some of us having financial struggles and only spending money because we want to have a good time with friends and colleagues), until he drank someone else's drink in front of their face and went ""oh sorry, I didn't mean to drink this blue drink, but this one"", which also wasn't his. Then I realized he drank most of my expensive drink that I had planned to have a good time with for most of the evening.
When I confronted I him about it I just got ""oh yeah, that one blue drink, sorry, I didn't mean that"" even though I literally saw and heard him go ""does anybody know who's this is? No? Then I guess it's mine."" a dozen times earlier. Of course my colleague went with his side of the story, since he'd been away on the dancefloor most the time and it's his friend. 

After this happened, I sat down for a couple of minutes and tried to understand happened, but shortly after, the friend outright tells me to leave because I'm ""bringing the mood down"", even though I was having an amazing time and dancing along, singing and partying untill that point and was already pushing myself above and beyond on a personal level.

I tried to tell my colleague that I felt like he was bullying me and trying to control me, but he didn't want to accept my experience of it even slightly, and the evening quickly fell apart.

All I wanted was to have some fun with people who are important to me, but I got no sympathy from my colleague.

Am I just lashing out or did I have justified reasons to be upset? Should I just soak it up and pretend like nothing for the sake of everyone else?

c156q7	2019-06-16 02:31:29		AITA for telling my roommate’s mom about his drug problem?	"Hey all, 

I just got some pretty lethal revenge on my ex-roommate. I’m curious as to whether or not I am in the wrong here. I probably am.

The ex-roommate in question recently moved out of my old rental. He was an annoying asshole for pretty much the entire year we lived together. He was rude, combative, disgusting, and entitled. To give you some idea of his habits, I’ll name a few:

1. He used my electric razor without asking and left his hair in the sink for me to clean. 
2. He has vomited all over the bathroom and failed to clean it until several days after. 
3. He often spat phlegm into the kitchen sink without cleaning it.
4. He never bought anything for the house, but would yell at the other roommates if something was missing (ex. toilet paper, spices, cooking oil/butter, basic ingredients, trash bags, etc.)
5. He had friends over and would loudly listen to music while doing every drug under the sun. 
6. He blocked me on social media platforms when I would message him asking to clean or take care of things around the house. 

Unsurprisingly, he didn’t clean anything when he moved out, and he refused to pay me or my roommates for the electric/wifi bill. 

Needless to say, I was pissed. I talked to our housing provider about our security deposit and I couldn’t do anything, and there was no way to get him to pay up for the wifi and electric bill because nothing was ever billed to him.

So, after a bit of brainstorming, I came up with an excellent way to hold him responsible for his actions.

I sent his mother a simple Facebook message, informing her that her “perfect” son avidly abused alcohol and cocaine throughout the year. 

Now the way I see it, this is a net positive. The worst thing that could happen to him is getting pulled out of school to go to rehab, which would help him with his obvious drug problem. To be honest, I doubt his mom will even take action- he’s very privileged. 

A few of my friends have said that this was a bad idea and that he will get more severe consequences than he deserves, but I disagree. His fixation on drugs and party culture prevented him from being a considerate roommate. To me, this all comes full circle.

But I know my opinion is biased. So, Reddit... Am I the asshole?"		1	0

I questioned her about why because I've never heard of anyone sending each other exams notes (since exam notes and long and hard to make). She said that she had exams every day next week so she wouldn't be able to make them. Now this girl is known for asking people for their work (she's not dumb, she's actually one of the smartest girls I know, she has a 95+ average for everything) but I don't mind sending things. She doesn't send me stuff in return but I have to admit that she does help me with my work (math and chem). Now the part that I think makes me TA is that I said that I didn't make any when in reality I did but they're super long and took me about a week to make because they're past 16 pages. I thought that I wasn't TA because exam notes are hard to make and it's not that she can't do them because her grades are 10-20% higher than mine, it's that she always asks for things from others and I shouldn't be obligated to send.

Things to note: 

I also have multiple exams next week

My grades are significantly lower so I'm working twice as hard to study for all my courses

"My daughter is 16 and ever since she was younger I would always give her responsabilities around the house, one of them being washing her own underwear. About two months ago while going into her room I noticed a pile of underwear near her bed, all of them were dirty. I washed them and when she got home I asked her about it and she told me she was too busy at school and had forgotten but it wouldn't happen again. Then, two weeks later I went to her room again and found yet another pile that was poorly hidden under the desk. This time I didn't wash them and when she got back home I asked her once again the reason and she said she had forgotten. I made her wash them and she seemed like she had learned the lesson. 

After that I keep an eye on her and sure enough, a week later I found another pile. This time I told her that if I found any more of it I would throw them in the trash and she apologized. When I did find yet another pile a few weeks later I threw it in the trash and did the same thing last week to another one. Yesterday, she finally realized that most of her underwear was gone and she threw a fit. I told her that if she wanted she could buy new underwear out of her allowance but I wouldn't spend money on it. She decided to take the issue to my husband who was aware of the problem but not the fact that I was throwing them in the trash. 

He told her that he wouldn't get in the middle of it and said the same thing to me but added that if I wanted his help then I should have kept him in the loop.

So the short and sweet is that I had work at 6am and woke up at 4:30 am because I have to wake up an hour before driving, otherwise I’ll be drowsy as I drive and I hate that feeling. Had an uneventful 9 hours at retail hell dealing with asshole customers and the occasional nice customer. Came home, showered, and went to the mall to pick up a father’s day gift for my dad, and picked up desert from some shitshop that my parents insisted on trying so I sucked it up and went to this dinky restaurant/desert shop and bought deserts because guests are coming over.

I was my dad’s sou chef in preparing plates for the guests, and he starts barking commands (quite unusual as he usually tells me clearly and coherently what to do and that’s what works) but he just kept barking single words at me like I was supposed to understand what he meant, which left me in a sour mood right before guests arrive. 

 I was expecting just my parent’s adult friends (one couple as the other couple had to cancel last minute) but they brought their annoyingly loud child, so I said my welcomes and retreated into my room. 

I’m minding my own business, and I get a text from my dad to pick up gelato as there’s a place walking distance from my apt, so I decide to scoop up a quick bite of ceviche that my dad whipped up (one of my favorite dishes that he makes) and as I go for a chip to salvage a bite from the 90% empty plate (which I’m mentally trying to be fine with as I wasn’t expecting them to eat *that* much ceviche), the husband just slaps the chip out of my hand “as a joke”. I decide to mentally fuck this shit, and go grab the gelato, the whole time he’s apologizing and saying it was a joke and I’m responding that it’s fine, it’s ok, etc. and leave. 

I go get the gelato and drop it off and take a walk to blow off steam and am typing this out. AITA for walking out on my parent’s get together?

P.S. AITA for deciding to not eat the ceviche leftovers if there are any left tomorrow just because this batch is associated with a bad experience?

My parents got them a fucking $250 gift card when they got their new house. The food we provided for this get together was more than the shitty gift they brought us.

Throughout my life my dad has been verbally abusive to my mother and I, with the situation sometimes becoming physical, I cannot begin to count the amount of times I’ve been called a fucktard and cunt between the ages of 7 to now, for just walking into his vision. For as long as I can remember he’s been a raging alcoholic, and every few weeks he crashes and gets violently sick, and no matter how many times he’s been admitted to the hospital and rehab clinics (which have left a hefty debt on our family) he refuses to get better. It’s come to a point where he leaves and comes home completely wasted every day, sometimes as early as 6:00 in the morning. He refuses to move out, and insists we leave even though we have several pets and young children in the house. I don’t understand how he still has his job as he’s too drunk to go, and hasn’t payed bills in months. He blames his problems on everyone except himself, and about a month ago he was so wasted he fell and fractured his ribs. Last night he was in so much pain and got so mad at everyone for not coddling him, but I just couldn’t bring myself to care. I feel guilty because he’s my father and family holds a strong place in my heart, but I feel like he deserves it and as sick as it sound I wish he’d been hurt more to feel just a little bit of the pain he’s inflicted on his kids. None of the my friends know and it hurts to see my younger brothers have to say no to friends who want to come over because they fear anyone finding out about their dead-beat dad. I feel like he deserves to suffer, but I also feel like an awful person and daughter for thinking that.	Not the A-hole	0	0

c151ys	2019-06-16 02:15:35		AITA- am i the asshole for refusing to clean up dog pee?	"On mobile, so sorry for formatting.
My roommate and his girlfriend decided to get a dog “together”. The reason together is in quotes is because she doesn’t take care of it, doesn’t financially contribute to it, nor does it live with her, but she picked it out. It lives with us. She just plays with it when she comes over. Also, I was not consulted about this dog. I came home to find this wolf in the living room. I have also have never had a dog before. The dog makes me very anxious because she jumps all over me when I come home, and I can’t wear shorts anymore because when she jumps on me she scratches my legs up. Once I snapped at the dog to get off, and she yelled at me “do NOT talk to my dog like that”. I have been made late to work because of “her” dog ripping through the trash, terrorizing the other animals, getting into pantries etc. and because Im the one expected to stop her when they’re not home. She even asked me how I like the dog, and I told her the truth. I dont like coming home because Im very uncomfortable, I can’t handle the dog’s energy, and I dont know how to care for a dog. She became cold, shrugged her shoulders and said “welp! You’d better get used to her!”
So, the incident at hand... they went out all day. Like out of town. They did not take the dog with them, nor did they apparently take the dog out. I come home from a 12 hour shift to find that the dog as pissed all over the carpet. I am not going to clean up after this animal because they have made it very clear that its THEIR DOG and not mine. Am I the asshole?"		1	0

I have a real mom) was never around I have 4 memories of her and she didn't pay a dime of the child support she was ordered to for both me and my brother. I reached out to her over Facebook and talked to her for a couple of days before asking if she could help me pay for school(I didn't even specify an amount) and she gave me a sob story about hurting her shoulder and being unable to work (today she uploaded pictures to Facebook of her on vacation in Mexico) So I asked my dad for help and he's been trying to work it out nicely for 2 months I think we should've already gone to court this is the last week he's giving her. I don't see anything wrong with taking her to court but a couple of people have told me it's wrong to take your mom (she's not my mom) to court.

c1516e	2019-06-16 02:12:55		AITA not caring that I used my sibling's chopsticks?	"I attend college live at home with two younger siblings, one similar age to me and the other a preteen. Call them Jane (preteen) and Bob (highschooler). 

Whenever we're eating dinner together for some special event (rare occasion, mom works late), Jane gets super offended about me sitting in ""their"" chair. 

This chair policy only comes in effect whenever we're sitting together, apparently. And I don't remember who sits where because it's like twice a month, and I don't care which chair I sit in. But I have to move everything I already settled down or they get upset.

And today a new thing with chopsticks came up with Bob. 

We're on a roadtrip with extended family and used my grandparent's chopsticks for instant ramen a few days ago. The chopsticks have different pretty colors/designs on the ends of them. Today when a cousin asked me which chopstick is yours, I just said whatever it doesn't matter. But they insisted ""which chopsticks is *yours* though?"" and I told them I don't remember, so they gave me one of them randomly and my ramen.

A few minutes later my sibling's ramen is done and he gets super pissed that I'm using his chopsticks. Chopsticks we are using for the second times in our lives, and never seen before.

Apparently all the other kids got their chopsticks that they used last time, and my brother had to suffer using a different chopstick. He spat some words at me and when I told him ""if you care that much, make sure to get them first next time"" and he told me to ""shut the fuck up you bitch you got your ramen first so I couldn't know idiot.""

Wtf? I don't care about the swearing, he does that whenever he gets angry, but this seems like such a petty thing he doesn't actually care about. 

But Jane's chair thing, and the fact that all the other kids (cousins, all younger teens) cared to remember what chopsticks they used last time confuses me. Is this a common thing to care about what eating utensil or chair you used? 

I know Bob uses reddit, dunno which subs, so if you see this then go ahead and see what other people say"		1	0
c15148	2019-06-16 02:12:44	dman2316	AITA for being angry that my bestfriend ghosted me and accused me of lying about having seizures?	"Hey guys, so the title pretty much sums the situation up but i'll give some context for clarity sake. I took a new medication for health issues and had a bad reaction and had two seizures pretty much back to back. My mom was with me when they happend on the front porch (that is relevant later in the story) My neighbor was walking by and saw me seizing and he ran over to help since he was a paramedic but he was off duty. He assessed me when i came to and decided i was lucid and aware so unless i had another seizure or started twitching i didn't need to go to the hospital. 

I called my bestfriend to tell him about this and we had a normal conversation about it and then hung up, nothing odd happened during that phone call and all seemed fine.. Over the next month i tried calling, texting and facebook messaging him all with no response. Eventually i called using someone elses phone and he answered and when he found out it was me he told me he didn't want to speak to me again because i was obviously lying about having seizures, his reasoning being if a paramedic had been there he would have sent me to the hospital. That's it. That's the only reason he decided i was lying. I begged him to talk to my mom so she could confirm i was telling the truth but he refused. So he completely ignored me, out and out called me a liar then refused to let me prove i was telling the truth. Our mutual friends have taken his side and say i should apologize to him for lying and hope he is nice enough to forgive me. But at this point i don't know if i even want to fix our relationship after him treating me like that. Obviously i won't apologize since i did not lie or do anything wrong but i don't know if i want to even try coming to an understanding so we can move on with our friendship. In an effort to be as open and objective as possible i feel it needs to be said that i do have a serious amount of health issues, like alot, so i can understand a little, suspicion for lack of a better word, or wondering how one person can have so much wrong but i still feel the way he went about it was inexcusably rude and wrong. If he had just outright said that seems sketchy or a bit unbelieveable when i first told him i would not have been upset and i would have offered him to talk to my mom who could have confirmed everything and things would be fine but he just ignored and avoided me and now says he never wants to speak to me again and i am very angry that after almost 10 years of friendship he would treat me like this.

Edit:  This also isn't the first time he has done this kind of thing. When i was 17 i was hit by a car and broke several bones and had obvious physical damage done and he accused me of lying about that too and even went so far as to tell my lawyer for the insurance case that he didn't believe me. He later apologized after the case was won when several doctors confirmed the injuries i had were consistent with a car accident and it was proved the accident happend. Now i wonder if he were to come around and realise i wasn't lying if i should forgive him and move on or if i should refuse and explain how much it hurt for my bestfriend to act like that.

Edit 2: noticed a couple people comment my gender wrong so just want to clairfy that i am a male and so is the friend to which this post is about."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c15121	2019-06-16 02:12:31	amanaska	WIBTA if I told two strangers to be STFU?	"Obligatory I'm on mobile, sorry for formatting.

This happened earlier today, and resolved itself after a hour, but I need to hear from you guys because I was mad and don't know if it was justified. It's also been a repeated problem every day I've been here. 

I'm on vacation in a Caribbean country, I'm from America. The hotel I'm staying at is right on the beach, only separated by a pool and a small bar. The hotel rooms have balcony's facing the pool and ocean. On my way to the beach today, there was a woman on her ground level balcony (patio?) playing very loud Chris Brown renditions of Disney music. I could hear it from my room (second floor) with the windows and doors closed. When I walked pasted the bar, there was a solo dude playing reggaeton on his phone and intermittently singing out loud. 

The bar generally is the only unit playing music, and today they weren't. I believe it's because there would be three competing and different songs playing. The person on the patio and the person on the beach were out before the bar opened (11am). The solo dude ( hotel guest) on the beach had no one around him, empty beach chairs in both directions. But with people on the beach in both far directions, including hotel guests. I was immediately frustrated because A) how inconsiderate/unaware can you be? B) in what world is this okay? (No seriously, educate me.)

I moved down the beach, and was still able to hear both songs playing. I just wanted to relax and read a book. It was incredibly distracting and very unrelaxing. Both of these people were not Americans, and I was trying to be really culturally conscious of what does and does nother bother other people in a different country/part of the world. But I was pissed. I don't want to hear your music. It's a no brainer that's rude, (right?). The hotel groundsman complimented the reggaeton music, and started a positive conversation with the solo dude about the singer. The bartender, closer to the patio woman, paid no mind to her music. There is such a culture of positivity here, I felt like a dick for even being bothered. But honestly, what the fuck? You know you can hear each other's music, and you know everyone else can hear the both of you. I could not make sense of their thought processes. 

I remained quiet because I felt like path of least resistance was the correct option.  And after one hour the patio woman turned her music off, and the solo dude on the beach left. So, whatever. 

But, WIBTA if I (politely) approached either about the volume of their music? Is that entitled? Am I missing something? Should I have not taken it so seriously? The hotel staff weren't bothered, they didn't enforce any noise rule. The beach is at least public. Who am I, after all? Incredibly American? Guys, help me. This will happen again tomorrow."

c150w3	2019-06-16 02:12:00	npc-observer	AITA for telling my mom to stop buying me sweaters as a gift, particularly if they are the wrong size?	"I told her I'm size M, like multiple times now. She keeps buying me sweaters which I mostly never wear because they're not my taste. It's often stuff with ""quirky"" prints on or something, and I wear pretty much 100 % plain basics from like Walmart or so for less than $ 10. Every time she buys me something, it's one or two sizes too large. I brought it up before, in a nice way, along the lines of ""I really appreciate it but could you next time please ..."". I also said I actually don't really want a gift and I will just buy things if I need them.

At my last birthday she did it again, and as the situation was already a bit tense, I was apparently visibly unhappy because it's again a size too large and I felt like she could have really remembered it at some point. Caused a fight. I also feel a bit like it has this subtext of ""you're overweight"" because she does running and has a strange idea of what healthy people look like (borderline anorexic). I work out and I'm actually pretty fit\*, but not in the same way she is. It's also just one of many little things, but idk it gets really frustrating. AITA here?  


\* Edit for Clarification: I work out, a lot, and I'm somewhat massive because of it. It's not fat, it's muscle, I literally have a sixpack. Her idea of fit is these scrawny runner lightweights she has in her sports group though."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I come from a first generation immigrant family and my siblings and I recently graduated from our colleges and started our full-time career. My brother and sister are consultants who are currently traveling for work and I am a banker on wall street. We all have high hours and I was recently assigned on a live deal which is making me work extremely long hours (70+ per week). I cannot afford to spend time to have a dinner with my dad tomorrow because I just don't have time for it. I told my dad that let's have dinner next month and he agreed, especially since I will be heading back home with him that weekend. My siblings can't do a dinner with him because they are traveling. I told them that I can't do a dinner with him and they are furious with me, saying that I don't care about our father and that I am an asshole. So reddit, am I an asshole here?

My parents live across the country and I’ve been freaking out. My mom is busy and can’t spend 24/7 in the hospital with him. They are self employed and him being out of work will put enormous strain on her.

My mom isn’t the type to ask for literally anything ever. She’s very self sufficient. But my dad is sick. She will need help. She will need company. She will never ask for any of these things but I know she needs them.

I bought a plane ticket and will be basically showing up at their house in two days. Not entirely uninvited- I told her I wanted to come, she said it was my right since he’s my dad, but she didn’t make it known that she wanted me.

Now I’m wracked with guilt that I’m imposing myself on her. But also, it’s my fucking dad and I’m losing my mind being far away and out of the loop. I don’t want to be a burden for her. But I can’t stand not being there while this is going on. I offered to rent a car and stay in a hotel and she refused both which makes me feel even worse because now she’s probably stacking taking care of a guest on top of everything else...

c14z06	2019-06-16 02:05:56	Drakonish	AITA for leaving the job when my dad gave me the opportunity?	So about an hour ago, my dad said we needed to do some jobs. It was 9:00, dark, and there was some trash in a box, a big old plastic bag, a ton of pinecones, a few garbage cans, and an old cooler. He then proceeded to order us around like we were servants. First I cleaned up the trash, as my brother put away some gardening tools and my other brother was cleaning some pinecones. I put one of the boxes that he told me to put on the pavement and got mad at me because “It’s not neat enough.” After that, my dad opened the cooler and poured out about 17 unopened, old beers and a rotted watermelon. Now, keep in mind I was barefoot, this was in the grass near a drain, and I had a big cut on my foot. I didn’t have any shoes because I had recently gone on a boat trip with my mom (parents divorced) and left my shoes in the boat. So now, my brother and I are opening bottles of old shaken up beer on the grate of the drain. We are completely sprayed with beer, and it got into my cut, which hurt like hell. To make things worse, there were ants nearby and the beer and watermelon attracted them, which got my feet bit. Now, we didn’t know that we were gonna do any of this. We had just eaten dinner and were winding down. Then, when we had cleaned everything up, I was going to go take a shower. He said, “No, now were going to the garage to clean that.” I was done with this. I told him off just like he had treated us in the last 30 minutes. Then he said, “Fine, I don’t care. Go ahead and leave.” And I went upstairs. Even after a 30 minute shower in hot and cold water, I still faintly smell like beer and my skin is sticky. AITA for leaving?	Not the A-hole	0	0

Here is the situation. I have been putting a lot of effort into eating healthy and improving my fitness for over a year now. My Grandma, god bless her, is morbidly obese and food is very much her love language. Everytime I see her she brings me food, usually several bags of grocerys, all stuff I am not willing to eat. I have stressed to her several times that I am trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle and try to politely tell her I dont want the things she brings me. If it was like one thing here or there I would just accept and throw it out to save her feelings but its usually like I said bags upon bags of food. Today she brought me grocerys again and I know shes just trying to help and she worries about me and loves me but there was not one thing I was willing to eat. I asked her today to please just not buy me groceries anymore and it really really hurt her feelings bad. She started crying and told me she put a lot of effort into trying to shop healthy for me, but the thing is her idea of healthy is so far from it because of the way she lives her life. I love her, I don't want to hurt her feelings, and I know this comes from a good place, but its so wasteful.

Apparently, when he is not on the quiet floor, he is in the help desk on the first floor not making any sounds..

c14vpi	2019-06-16 01:55:19		AITA for being in the shower when my dad gets home?	"Yes, I know this is petty, but it's been bugging me so much.

So I (F20) moved back in with my parents for the summer before I head off to school in Canada (I'm transferring from my old university in the states which is why I'm not living near there now). My mother doesn't seem to grasp the fact that I'm an adult now, which I understand to a degree. She's always been a bit overbearing and all that, but sometimes she just treats me like I'm still 12 and it bugs the hell out of me. My dad is pretty quiet, we've never had a strong relationship but I don't resent him for it or anything. I've just accepted it for the most part, and we're getting a bit closer as I get older so it's fine.

I just started a new job (today was my second day) working in a kitchen at a nursing home. Yesterday I worked from 9 am to about 8:30 pm, and today I worked from 1 pm to 8 pm. I clean dirty dishes, prep food, and basically run like a madwoman because we're really understaffed so each person does as much as they can. I'm on my feet all day and splash old, frankly disgusting food onto myself constantly while I'm cleaning or gathering things from the dining hall. It's a gross job, but it pays well so I have to stick with it for now. When I get home, I'm exhausted and sore all over, especially my feet. I immediately shower and get all the gunk off, and I'll admit, I don't go very fast in there because I can finally start to wind down, and it feels so nice on my sore body. We don't have a water bill because we have a well that provides our house with water, and I certainly don't drain that of water or use all the hot water.

My dad also works in a kitchen and has for a couple years now. I don't know much about what he does, but I know he does a lot of cooking. He works in a buffet restaurant though, so it's a different environment. He works either from 10 am to 9 pm or 2 pm to 9 pm. When he gets home, he takes about a 5 minute shower then goes about his nightly business.

Now, I understand that we both work long days in fast environments, but I get home about 30 minutes before he does, so I shower first. Yesterday, my mom kept knocking on the door after he got home yelling at me to get out. I took about 5-10 extra minutes once he got home to finish up what I was doing and get out. Today, my mom scolded me and told me she ""didn't want to listen to him about it,"" and ""he's all sweaty and dirty and wants to take a shower too."" I responded back with ""it's my house too, I live here, and I want a shower too. He can share."" She did not like that and keeps saying things like ""you need to hurry up"" and ""he wants a shower too."" I would understand if I took an extra 20-30 minutes, but it was between 5-10 minutes at the most. I don't understand why it's such a big deal for him to wait at the most 10 minutes to shower.

So, AITA?"		1	0
c14vlw	2019-06-16 01:55:02	deviztate	AITA for bailing on dinner plans?	"My girlfriend and I had dinner plans tonight with my friends at 6pm, friends whom I have been very close with for about 10 years. We have been very busy for the past 6 months and finally all decided to meet up to get some dinner. I haven't seen my friends in probably 7-8 months. We decide to meet up in a downtown-ish area, where there are a ton of restaurants, and some shops, single driving lanes. This downtown area is deep within suburbia. It's kinda like a big shopping center that is like 3-4 blocks big, with a ton of apartments/townhouses as well. 

Side note: My girlfriend is staying with her uncle right now to help him with post surgery. She's been helping him get back to normal life, and also assisting him with some medical devices which can go off any given moment. So I already knew going into dinner tonight that we were on somewhat of a time crunch, as her uncle asked her to be back home around 9pm. 

Anyways, I've been to the area before, and while it was pretty busy those times, I was always able to find parking. Usually there are about 3-4 parking areas that I would guess can fit on average 50-70 cars. All parking areas are packed. General street parking is full. There was street parking areas that were vacant, but they were residential parking zones, and the cars parked had parking permits. 

We drove around for 30 minutes looking for parking. At this point, I'm starving, and my girlfriend is also. I'm starting to get pissed. I basically avoid places where parking is scarce. I'm not a picky person, but I'm super anal about being able to park. Super super anal. At this point, it's like 6:45pm, I honestly decide to give up and text my friend our situation, and say that we won't be able to make it even though we are here, but cannot find any parking within a 5 minute drive.

 We then left the area and just went to an actual restaurant where there was plenty of parking in front of the building and had a quick/nice meal and I was able to drop my girlfriend off at her uncle's at 9pm. After I had texted my friend saying that we could not find parking at all, around 6:45pm, she texted me while I was driving, saying that there was a parking garage with plenty of parking. By the time I saw the text, we already arrived at the other restaurant. I texted her back saying sorry, we drove for a long time, and I did not see a parking garage. I also stated that we would love to take them out to dinner within the next few weeks due to us bailing on dinner. 

It has been several hours since I texted her sorry for bailing, and she hasn't texted me back. I've had people cancel on my before and it was no big deal, and vice versa. Unfortunately with her, it kinda takes it too personal, from what my friends and I have noticed when people cancel dinner plans with her. I'm not stressing about the situation at all. I'll reach out to her in a few weeks. AITA for bailing?

TL;DR: Bailed on dinner plans due to not being able to find parking after driving around for 30 plus minutes."	Asshole	0	0

I (18 F) graduated from high school yesterday, and I have lots of extended family in town to celebrate the graduation. This post is particularly about my grandfather on my father’s side; that set of grandparents have always been heavy alcoholics (each downing at least 12 beers EACH) per day, and I have never had a great relationship with them because of their alcohol issues and the fact that they’ve never made an effort to reach out to my brother and I, or be much of grandparents at all. I’ve always felt that my grandfather comes across a bit creepy, and I could never really pinpoint why, but I always just got not good vibes from him.

Yesterday, after graduation and after my grad party, things were settling down for the night and my grandparents had each had at least 10 beers. I was sitting at a table talking to my mom when my grandfather comes up behind me, slowly strokes my hair, and whispers in my ear, “I like your hair so much better when it’s straight; it’s beautiful curled, but I LOVE it when it’s straight”. My mom was visibly taken aback by this. It was not said in a casual, complementary tone, it was a tone in which you’d use with a lover or someone you are involved with. 

I’m still really, really uncomfortable after this and my mom agrees that it was extremely creepy and weird. I told my dad about it, and he just laughed it off with the statement, “family, right? They can be pretty weird”. I was upset that my father didn’t take what happened more seriously, and told him that I didn’t want to see my grandparents for a long while after they leave. He got mad and told me that they are family, and that my grandfather had been drinking and meant nothing by it.

AITA for not wanting to see my grandfather again after this creepy interaction with him?

EDIT: Wow, truly thank you all so much for your replies. I was pretty sure that I wasn’t the asshole, but on the other hand we do only see these grandparents probably only once every few years, and they gave me an extremely generous amount of money for my graduation present, so I felt really guilty about the fact that I don’t want to see them at all again.

FINAL EDIT: After getting up this morning, my dad came up to me and apologized for how he reacted to hearing what happened. He told me that he fully supports my decision to not see them again, and that he himself is getting sick of their behavior. In general they are arrogant, judge mental people, and the excessive drinking makes their personalities worse. I appreciate my dad apologizing to me and ultimately supporting my side of the issue."

c14rwr	2019-06-16 01:43:06		AITA for wanting my own contact information on a Craigslist ad?	"Hi. I’m a 20 year old female, and I’m moving out of the country soon so I’ve been needing to sell my car. I planned on posting it to Carvana, Craigslist, Facebook and all that stuff.  

I don’t wanna call him my boyfriend because you know, it’s that whole “it’s complicated” mess, especially with me moving. But he’s about as close to a boyfriend as you can get. We’ve been together for a couple years, but as I’m moving it’s pretty clear it’s coming to an end soon.. We’re best friends and still want to be in contact. But we’ll call him T.

T kept insisting on what I should price it at, where to post it, how to negotiate, etc and I honestly appreciated all the info because this is my first car and I’m not really sure how to do all of that. He kept saying he would post the Craigslist ad and I kinda just brushed it off, which is probably my fault since I never directly told him “no” even though I was a little hesitant. 

He told me to send him a bunch of pics of my car and posted it on Craigslist. No big deal, I figured he was being helpful and appreciated it because I’ve been really busy with packing. But I never asked him to post the ad. He insisted. 

Then he started sending screenshots of text messages with people who were interested in my car. I asked him why he put his info on the ad instead of mine since it was my car and it’d be better for them to talk to the owner, right? He said “you don’t know what you’re doing. You’ll ruin it.” I kept insisting he just put my number because 1) it’s MY car and 2) I need to get this experience as I’ve never sold a car before. He got upset and said I was being ungrateful. He eventually put my number on the ad. 

A couple days ago someone texted me about the car and said something about emailing me but never getting a response. I told T to put my email on the ad. He said “no one emails about a car.” I told him someone did, so just put it on the ad. That was two days ago and he still hasn’t. I mentioned it and he got mad saying “I’m not gonna drop everything to do some dumb irrelevant chore because you can’t be thankful for a second”. 

Yesterday he sent me pictures of a Facebook ad he posted for my car. I asked him why he did that because I was planning on posting to Facebook, which he then claimed he didn’t know I had a Facebook which was a flat out lie. I don’t even think he ever gave the people my number or anything. 

Also, side note; today he paid $100 to a random man in a walmart parking lot to fix a dent in my car. I told him flat out before he paid him that I don’t have that kind of money or a job right now. The man hit it with a hammer a few times and said he was done. Welp, the dent didn’t even get fixed and tbh it looks worse now and he STILL gave him the money when the dent was obviously not fixed!!!! Now I feel obligated to pay him back and I was obviously pissed off and he got mad because he probably thinks I was being ungrateful then too.

c14q8o	2019-06-16 01:37:24	nocryinginfootball_1	AITA for shutting the lights off on my roommate?	"I have 2 roommates, Joe and Karl. Karl and I used to be best friends, but had a falling out and haven’t spoken since. I’ve had time to properly reflect and know he is not someone I want back in my life. It was agreed that Joe would move out at the end of June, though we haven’t discussed how we’d cover rent when Joe moved out.

So here’s the issue: since we haven’t discussed what we’d do when Joe moved out, I asked him the other day what he wanted to do about the rent for the last two months. He told me that we’re just going to split the next two months in half. He didn’t discuss it with me nor did he intend to. He simply stated we’re going to split it, and it kind of pissed me off that he just expected me to be okay with splitting it in half. 

Now here’s why: I sleep in the living room, and Joe and Karl share the only bedroom in the apartment. When Joe moves out, Karl will obviously have his own room. So I don’t think it’s fair for us to pay the same when (a) his living space is obviously bigger and (b) he has significantly more privacy. So I asked him if he would be okay with splitting rent if we were to switch places. His argument was that he had to live with Joe the whole year (P.S., Joe leaves on weekends) and I had my own space, and they are hardly in the living room. I thought those were fair points, because they’ve never been overly intrusive. So I agreed to pay half, based on that

Fast forward to last night: I come home at 2 in the morning, and Karl is in the living room on his laptop, just fucking around. I thought okay...he had his own room for that, the space he’s paying for. He’s in my space right now, the space I’M paying for. So I get ready for bed (I took maybe 10 minutes, which I think was ample time for him to realize he was now invading my privacy since I was home). I finally come out, I tell him “I’m going to bed now, okay?” and I shut off the lights. He gets mad, starts stomping around and slamming doors as he goes in and out of the apartment, finally going to bed after maybe 15 minutes of this. 

I think I was well within my rights to dictate when the lights go out in my room. So AITA for shutting the lights off on my roommate?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c14plq	2019-06-16 01:35:08	throw-a-wayayay	AITA For being pissed everyone tells me “not to be a baby” about my fears?	"I’m on mobile, so I apologize for that beforehand.

So there’s only really one thing I’m simply terrified of in life: bees/wasps/any insect that resembles them (hornets, yellowjackets, etc). And apparently I’ve been told that annoys the hell out of everyone that knows me, even my close friends and family. 

I know my reaction is exaggerated, I do know that. Whenever I see one within five feet of me I start to panic. Full-on hyperventilation, sweating, heart pounding through my chest type of thing. I get the irresistible urge to run from it as fast as I can. I can do snakes, I can do spiders, heights, and small spaces but a wasp will almost make me cry I’m so terrified.

Here’s where I could be TA. My mom has said that I need to grow up and not act like a baby anymore and just deal with it, and that my behavior is extremely annoying. I know that I have an irrational response but that’s not exactly something I can control. So I was fuming (though I didn’t show how mad I was because I know better than to talk back), but I’m not sure if I’m TA for being upset because I know my reaction is irrational and extreme.

I have been stung before, and my entire foot and ankle all swelled up and I was in excruciating pain. I don’t think that’s a normal response? However the fear started before that, for as long as I can remember honestly. I’m also allergic to quite a number of other bugs though I’m not as terrified of anything else.

So reddit, am I being a whiny AH and should suck it up or do I have a right to be pissed?

Edit: I am (17F) and therapy isn’t an available option for me right now, even though I would love to seek help.

Edit 2: Thank you all, I hadn’t realized I probably have an actual phobia. I will definitely seek help as soon as I go to college now that I know how crucial it is for me to."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c14ooc	2019-06-16 01:32:11		AITA for quitting my family business after my mom ruined my 21st birthday?	"For my 21st birthday, my boyfriend and I had plans for months prior to spend the day together going to bars, arcades and different kinds of shows in Los Angeles. (My birthday landed on a saturday so it was perfect).

2 weeks prior to my birthday, my mom tells me she wants to take me and my younger brothee to the grand canyon along with my step father. I told her that I already had plans and reservations at several places and I wouldn't be able to do that weekend. 

My mom has a m e l t d o w n. 

She starts crying, telling me I'm unappreciative, I didn't care about her and that she wasn't going to force me to go. My little brother also starts crying so before It got worse- I agree to go. I was completely guilted into it but I agreed. 

On this trip, I was treated very poorly.

They even took my cell phone privileges away and I couldn't communicate with my boyfriend of three years ON my birthday. My younger brother is very spoiled and decided everything we did the entire trip aswell. Any time I made a recommendation I was looked at as if I had killed someone. He also cried at every place we went to because he was fighting with his father. I really wasnt having a good time and I spent the day miserable.  This made me very upset, so the morning after I packed up all my stuff and took a train back to California.  As I'm packing in the hotel room my mom is screaming at me that I was traumatizing her son, ruining her vacation, did not care about her or my little brother, and threatened my boyfriend. 
She started calling me names and trying to get me to hit her (getting in my face screaming 'hit me') [crazy I know]. Bringing up horrible things from my past. 
She even started blocking the door and would not give me my wallet so I could go. I told her she was sick in the head.  I had to call the police to help retrieve it. I spent a lot of money going home but it was ultimately worth it and better for my state of mind. 

 I get home and decide I'm going to take some time off from my mom's business. (I would otherwise spend half of the week at her home working with her) 

I guess after she got back she decided to tell everyone in my family that I told her I wished death upon her and that her ""sicknesses spread to her head'  Now, my mom has had various types of cancers so I know I would never say this. In fact my family members at one point thought my mom was faking being Ill, but I always had her back. 

Hearing her play THE victim made me so upset I quit working under her completely and I have no intention on ever doing so again. This trip made me realize she had way too much power over me and I need to become independent. My family thinks I'm being cruel and is actually encouraging me to APOLOGIZE to MY MOM.

My mother tells me each year to wish my stepfather a happy father's day. I don't think I have ever done it. I am the only stepchild and he doesn't have biological children, so I would be the only one he would hear it from.

When he does a favor for me, I thank him in person and/or frequently send thank-you cards. I wished him a happy birthday not too long ago. We certainly get along.

c14o8j	2019-06-16 01:30:55	hahaLONGBOYE	AITA for using my phone in a movie theatre?	"So, this happened a while ago during the movie Us directed by Jordan Peele. Me and my boyfriend went to a late showing in a far off theatre way after release date like we always do because we prefer empty theaters so there’s less distractions and we can cuddle/laugh with each other, what have you. 

So! We walked all the way up near the back rows pretty much just us in there. Next thing you know a group of 5-7 people walk up and sit pretty much directly behind us maybe one row back in an otherwise empty theater. 
We quickly realized we were not going to have a good time as these people were the loudest most obnoxious people I’ve ever heard watch a movie. I get jumping/ laughing, but these people were basically directing the movie from behind us very loudly the whole time like “OHHH HELL NO DONT GO IN THERE” “YOU STUPID GIRL DONT DO THAT” ”OH THATS THE BAD GUY!!”  etc. VERY loudly, the ENTIRE time. 
I swear I have never heard anything like this outside of watching a movie in your own home. And still never heard anything quite as obnoxious. 
My boyfriend and I were getting pretty pissed off where we couldn’t even enjoy the movie anymore and were super distracted, so at this point I pull out my phone with my brightness up to go on Facebook and check other stuff online while I’m half watching the movie now. 
Now these people tap on my chair and ask ME to please turn off my phone they’re trying to enjoy a movie and it’s distracting. When they decided to sit behind us, the only other people in the movie theatre. At this point without wanting to start an argument about how ironic their request was to me I just turn back around and continue using my phone while they got louder.
They followed us to our car afterwards in the parking lot to scare us or something I don’t really know. We’re both armed so no big deal but I thought it was insane, so was I really the asshole here?!?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I’m getting married in a few months and my FH and I are paying for the wedding ourselves. When I found my wedding dress, it was within the budget I set for myself and I was fully prepared to pay for it myself. When I ordered it, my mom insisted that she wanted to pay the remaining balance for it, out of tradition of the bride’s parents paying for the wedding. Now, my parents are not well off, nor do they make a lot of money. So when I agreed to this, I was expecting her to maybe be able to put a max of $100 on my dress and then paying off the remainder myself. However, I got a phone call a few weeks ago from the bridal shop to say nothing has been paid on my dress and just a reminder of the remaining balance. I’m hurt that my mom didn’t even bother to make any kind of payment on my dress- not even $10. Like I said, I wasn’t expecting her to get anywhere near paying it off, but she didn’t even attempt to make a payment despite her insistence on paying for it. My FH doesn’t think so, especially considering past occasions where she has made empty promises. So, WIBTA if I confront her about it?

"My best friend only seems to have one flaw in my eyes, that she's very hardcore into astrology. Every other day or so she sends a meme with ""This is how capriunicorns and gemimints always think"" or whatever. Sometimes she comments on other people's behavior like ""that's because you're saggitaurusius"" and I just say  that the stars' locations do not have any affect on human attributes, and she's unironically like ""yeah right"". Sometimes it's pretty mild and she just seems to do it in good fun, but other times she says it's not her fault that she's being a bitch, it's just her zodiac sign. Or she'll call her coworker a massive slut behind her back because the moon wasn't fully lit by the sun the day she was born. I'm a very scientific and logic person, and have realised that i'll probably never change her mind. Am I the asshole for making her feel bad about it, or telling her that what she believes in isn't true.

I hope I can get an unbiased opinion whether you believe in astrology or not.

I changed jobs and city's and have my own flat now with my cat. My parents helped my, I was living with them for 3 weeks before I got my own place.

  


My ex wanted a change too. As I didnt hate him, I stayed in contact. He decided to move to the same city as me. And because I felt bad for him , I made the offer he can live with me for 4 weeks, untill he got his own place.

  


  


So to make it short, there is a festival in town this weekend. And I (35w) decided to stay home. I didnt feel any social and later in the night i would feel kinda unsave to be out alone.

  


My friend went, he was hoping I would later join, which I didnt. He called me at 2 o'clock and waked me. Told me he didnt know how to come home (he is living with me at the moment), but also that he is at a big train station. I told him which trams he could use and he can ask google. He was clearly drunk.

  


Because of the festival there will be trams the whole night. He got angry and keeped calling me and sending messages. I turned my phone in flight mode, because I have to work tomorrow.

  


He keeps telling me, that it is my fault. I let him down. I think if he can write messages he can use google maps. I wont leave the house at 2:30 am, especially not on the festival weekend.

Now I am sitting in bed, wide awake and kinda scared and waiting for him to come home.

  


I know I should never allowed him to move in with me. But I felt guilty and couldn't go no contact.

  


So, am I the asshole because I didnt take a tram (I have no car) to search for him? I feel bad for ignoring his calls (I answered the first 3)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Dh work is more flexible on days, but typically he works from 7am-3pm.  For example, he may work sat-sun but have mon-tues off.  Sometimes he'll work a 7 day week, other times he may work 1 or 2 days in the week (construction)

I am an early bird.  On the weekend, even after the rare large night, i am definitely up by 8am, usually 7am.  I get tired at night.  Dh is a night owl and would prefer to stay up to 2-3am (or later) and sleep all day. 

We dont get many weekends off together, and the ones we do, he just sleeps.  He will easily sleep until 2pm on a sat or sunday, meaning we have no time to do anything productive together. He wil sleep for a 12-13 hour stretch.

Im happy to compromise the following ways:  i stay up super late sometimes (typically drinking watching tv or playing video games, since what else is there to do at or after midnight? None of this is really my jam).  I dont expect him to get up at 8am, i think 11am is a reasonable time to sleep in and yet still be able to do something. I try to entice him with food, making bacon and eggs or something and then offer him some.

Im just frustrated.  I feel like my weekends are wasted.  Its a beautiful sunny winters day and we could be going to the market, on a hike, doing some gardening, lunching, watching his family play footy etc.  But no, he is sleeping.

In addition, we have chores lists and i always do mine for the most part during the week, so i can have a leisurely weekend.  He does all his on his days off so when he does finally get up on a weekend day, he has stuff to do. 

I do go do activities with friends or by myself (eg i  went and played tennis all morning with a friend last week) but i also would like to hang out with my husband sometimes.  

Anyway, he thinks sleep is a personal thing and i have no right ever to try and wake him up, even if we've made plans with each other.  He is happy sleeping the way he does and doesnt want it interrupted.

2) I didn’t want my gf to sit alone in the corner. We were a lot of guys and the only women were my friends GF and his cousin. And she is not very extrovert while my friends is not good at talking to people they don’t know well

3) because of 1) I would not be the “guy” who is boring and only talks with my gf

So today me (27F) and my husband (26M) were driving through the city to go to the store. We didn’t realize the gay pride parade was through our neighborhood and a lot of the streets were closed off which made driving very difficult.

Anyway, as me and my husband are driving through this clusterfuck we’re making jokes about all the awful drivers who are driving so erratically because everyone’s pissed off about the detours. There’s also a lot of cars stopping to like perv at scantily clad girls in the street and me and my husband are making fun of these pervs. It’s all good and we’re joking back and forth. I’d like to add we’re the kind of people who make inappropriate and not “PC” jokes from time to time. We’re an interracial couple (I’m white and my whole family is from Poland, he’s Puerto Rican) and we make jokes about race, religion, etc.

At some point as we’re driving through this I sarcastically was like “you know, why does it have to be a gay pride parade? Like why does it have to be something that fucks up traffic? I bet a lot less people would be homophobic if it was changed to like, lets pogo stick in the park for gay rights”. I know, not my finest joke or super clever but I was just making a silly comment. My husband said that’s super offensive and in the political climate that we’re in right now I shouldn’t say things like that. I was like I didn’t say it to a group of randos I said it to you and second of all I’m bisexual, it’d be the same as you making a joke about Puerto Rican people. He said it’s not the same and I shouldn’t make a joke like that ever again.

Husband works a lot, not by choice but it’s his job (13hrs/day, 7 days a week).. so I’ve taken on everything else since we agreed that me not working would be better, from cleaning, taking care 100% of the kids. We live more than comfortably financially, so no stress there. But I definitely can tell my husband gets stressed out from working a lot understandable, anyways not of importance.

So my days consist of taking care of everything, twice a week I go and train for an hour and there’s usually not much time left for myself besides that. The girls have summer break now, so I don’t have to get up early anymore, which is great. The past 3 days I’ve been staying up until 2 am or 3 am gaming, I don’t start gaming until about 11 pm, because I’m too busy the rest of the day. Husband goes to bed around 10. 

He’s been getting really irritated that I’ve been staying up so late and almost turning it into a fight and his reasoning is “it makes it seem like you don’t do anything and you just have a gaming addiction.” Usually I go to bed about the same time as him, but I’ve been needing some time alone to relax, and one of my ways of relaxing is playing video games.

Everyone is fed and asleep, the house is clean, bills are paid, animals are taken care of, fridge is stocked, and I don’t have to get up early now it’s summer break, so why does it matter if I stay up a little later?

I’m currently in a relationship with another girl who does not like my ex girlfriend, partly because this has been an issue before where ex girlfriend would hit me up and I would say “nah I’m in a relationship you can’t be actin like that towards me.”

Finally the ex says “whatever gn” and is content with leaving me be. 

I tell my current girlfriend about it and she just gets super pissed and talks about how innapropriate and uncool that is. I agreed with her and told her that I told me ex that it super innapropriate and uncool and that she can not be getting drunk and trying to hit me up because I’m taken.

Well my girlfriend wants to confront my (currently drunk off her ass) ex and call her out for doing this. After I expressed the sentiment that I don’t want my girlfriend that has no connection to my ex to contact her out of no where to reverberate what I’ve already said, she said that she doesn’t want to “confront her” she just wants to talk to her and have a “heart to heart”. 

I asked her what exactly the goal of the her envisioned “heart to heart” was and she said she didn’t want to talk about it right now. 

So I’m thinking that she’s still pissed off at the ex and wants to call her out and put her on blast, which she has every right to do so. But I don’t want to be attached to the drama that ensues between them. So I told her that if she really was dead set on reaching out and talking to my ex despite my repeated insistence that we drop it and focus on our own lives rather than give her the time of day, that I would want to separate.  Does this make me an asshole? Am I an asshole for breaking up with my girlfriend if she tries to go and speak to my ex about her actions today despite my wishes to leave it alone?

TL:DR - My ex hit me up and my current girlfriend is pissed and says she wants to just talk, but her tone about it before I expressed disapproval was much more hostile and I feel that she’s going to reach out and start a confrontation despite me wanting to just leave it as is. So I told her that if she does go out and try to talk to my ex about it that I would be wanting to deprecate."	Asshole	1	0

"So my mom wants me to get out of the house to go eat some Chinese food and watch people dance. My friend is also going, but the thing is, we both don’t want to go. Our parents keep telling us, “you should go because (friend) is going!” I kept expressing my distaste for not wanting to go, just wanting to spend the day before my birthday in peace (My birthday is on a Monday) and then we can celebrate on Monday. 

Mom eventually got sick and tired of my yapping and told me that I’m taking this for granted. She says she’s willing to buy anything for me there, but since I don’t want to go, she’ll treat herself. I was glad that she’d focus on herself there rather then me, because I think she’d enjoy the festival more then I would. But mom was still mad and told my dad that she would no longer cook or do anything for us in the next week, dad or us would have to do that for ourselves.

My friend (he's watching this thread) says it's basically stealing money from the theater, because

(1) I'd buy food at the theater anyways if I didn't buy it beforehand (I wouldn't). 

(2) The extra price of food at theaters include the ""theater experience"" and clean up. If I don't pay the theater price I'm enjoying the ""full theater experience"" without having to pay for it. 

(3) It's weird and unethical.

every Tuesday I pick up my friend from her place and take her to uni, we have a class together and found it was easer to carpool. 
I have a 5 year old autistic daughter and so I drop her off and then take me and her to uni. 
I want to add that my friend knows my daughter is autistic. this is related to the story 

yesterday we where driving to my daughter's kindergarten and my friend decides to tell a joke, I do not remember the joke as a whole but it was about an autistic person and the punchline used the word re***d. 
my daughter immediately asked what the word meant and i started to panic, I told her that it's a naughty word that will result in a time out if you say it.

I then turned to my friend and told her to get out of my car, she looked shocked and thought I was joking until I pulled over and told her to leave. she had a 20 minute walk or so to the campus.

c14g9l	2019-06-16 01:06:06		AITA for not supporting a friend’s baby name choice?	"I was a part of a group of 6 women who met in college and stayed close in the following years. 

One girl, “Sarah”, met a guy at work and immediately told us all how she accepted a date from a guy named Larry. She made him the butt of several jokes about dating an old man. 

In fact Larry was our age and they really hit it off. Sarah told us all how Larry was a third, as in named after his father who was named after his father. Naturally we asked if they would name their first born son Larry? No. Absolutely not. Never ever ever. 

Larry even joined in saying he wouldn’t name his son it. He experienced bullying at worst, constant comments from other kids and adults at best. 

Fast forward, they get engaged, married and pregnant. They hold fast that the baby will NOT be named Larry. 

They find out they are having a boy and slowly she starts changing her tune. Comments about how “Larry isn’t *that* bad of a name...” and how her son “will be so lucky for being apart of a dynasty.”

I asked Sarah if they could name her son Lawrence and call him Larry? Or choose Larry as his middle name? Hard no.

We would tease and make facetious comments early on when Sarah was still adamant her baby would not be named Larry. After she started seriously considering it, that all tapered off. Then it just became awkward, we’d all dance around the name. 

A friend, “Beth” and I threw Sarah’s shower and following the party she confronted us about the name. She wanted to know what we really thought about Larry. Beth pretended not to understand and I thought it was now or never. I told her I was shocked she was picking it, what about all the bullying and teasing her husband went through as a child? Weren’t they worried they were setting their kid up for the same thing? She told me to fuck off before leaving. 

That night she started a group chat without me to complain about what I said. However all of our friends backed me up if not said worse things. 

Sarah basically fell off the planet from our group after that. We all learned about Larry IV’s birth from social media. Texts and calls went unanswered. 

It was getting better for a bit and she came to Beth’s baby shower 6 months after Larry’s birth. Things were going OK until the topic of the baby’s gender (unknown) and possible name came up. They had a name picked out for a girl but were undecided for a boy. Sarah started lobbying hard for Larry. I think the other guests who didn’t know the backstory thought it was a joke at first. That really upset Sarah and she told us she was on “a campaign to get more babies named Larry so her’s wouldn’t be the only one.” It was a total party killer and I made an awkward announcement for dessert. Sarah left before I could even get the cake out of the fridge. 

I moved to the other side of the country shortly after that and still keep in touch with all the girls, save Sarah. Apparently she still holds a grudge and we’re all the bitches who bullied her unborn child."	Not the A-hole	1	0

You might already think that i'm the asshole , but listen to some backstory first. So my friend who i've known for 2 years runs a youtube channel. Not extrememly big , he had about 120k subs and got about 10k-40k views per video. Me and a few others (including my friend) run a discord server. He owns it , of course. There is a rank in the discord that i'm in , the editor rank. Me and the 'few others' i mentioned earlier are editors. Not just any type of editors , no , we are the editors for his youtube channel. Between the 4 of us , we have a scedule. I do monday and tuesday uploads , one person does wednesday , one person does thursday , and one person does friday. I do 1 more day  than everyone else because I'm , ""The best editor and i trust you the most."" Well a few days ago he told me that he was going to take a break from youtube , and i didn't have to edit for a week.  I don't typically watch his videos except for when i'm editing them , but later that night i decided to watch his latest video. I hadn't seen it since it was saturday and his last upload was on friday. (Or so i though.) The last video had been uploaded 4 hours ago. It seemed weird so i clicked the video. The name of the video was , ""My Friend is Leeching off me ( \[my name\] Exposed!)"" I was shocked , i watched the entire video and i was soooo fucking mad.  He said that i was leeching off him by live streaming me editing his videos. I was super mad. I messaged him on discord about it and went off. He gave  some lame excuse about how he was just doing it for views and he was sorry. Everything calms down and eventually it's my time to edit his video.  I edit the video as normal and send him the vid. He aproves of it and gives me the go ahead to upload it.  I had the password and email so i could log into his account and upload a vid when he was busy. He just so happened to be busy and so i set my plan into motion , and he was none the wiser. Instead of uploading the video i edited , i uploaded a compialtion of  hardcore porn and nazi propoganda. His channel was banned sometime during the night. I woke up to frantic discord calls and i eventually answered one. He told me that his channel was banned and i did my best to act suprised. It's been two days and he still doesn't know i did it.

c14ext	2019-06-16 01:02:00	endship123	AITA for dropping out of a road trip and going on our own?	"This is my go-to throwaway. Not new here. 

About a month ago, some of my relatives started planning a road trip and invited me along. It was for my 12 to be 13 year old little cousin’s birthday. They told me I could bring who I wanted to, and I picked my best friend. 

We (me and bff) have done long road trips before, and have always cut corners where possible.

Altogether, there were 9 of us going. We were going to split costs, and per person, excluding food and gas, it was going to cost around ~$300 each. For 9 people, that’s really not bad at all. 

I made it CRYSTAL CLEAR what lodging prices we’d be willing to pay. CRYSTAL CLEAR. I‘m not badly off, but I like to budget carefully.

I also was pretty pumped to go spend some time with my cousins. My little cousin is a single child who looks up to me as a big sister, and was really happy when she found out I was going. Of course, I played it up, and said we would have so much fun and that I was so excited to spend time with her. 

A few days ago, one of my relatives (who had been one of the people to propose the trip) sent me an approximation of our finances and I was blown away. We’d gone from our initial plan of a few motels and airbnbs to literal 5 star hotels that cost WAY more than what was originally discussed. They’d also added several extra and unnecessary stops that were all VERY frugal places. 

It wasn’t what we agreed to, and it was an INSANE amount more than what had been first planned. I said if they’d pay the extra prices they tacked on, we would go, but that otherwise it was a no-show for us. 

Relative asked me if I was insane. I dropped us out immediately, as did the two other people who were also going. It felt like they were trying to milk us for our money so they could do things we weren’t the least bit interested in. Relative got super pissed at me and told me I was ruining everyone’s fun and making his daughter miserable. Not sure what he told the other two people. 

Me, bff, and my girlfriend all then went along with the same plan, but within our budget. We’ve already booked whatever lodging we might need, and are leaving in 2 weeks. 

Turns out when everyone dropped, they decided not to go, and are now furious that we’re going without them. My family has been calling me nonstop saying I ruined little cousin’s birthday, that I should be ashamed, and should have booked a different trip. Then my little cousin called me crying on the phone and asking me why I didn’t want to spend time with her.

I don’t feel like the asshole here. The prices they sent me were insane. I like my cousin, but it felt like her parents lowballed us so we would agree. And I don’t feel like, because she’s a little kid, we should have suck it up and gone. But idk. I’ve had a migraine since all of this started. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c14dmu	2019-06-16 00:58:12	oceanic-feeling	AITA for not buying my partner a new pair of shoes after the dog chewed one of her shoes?	"My partner (31F) and I (38M) own our home together and have a dog and a cat. The dog was mine before we met but since we’ve been together, the dog has been considered our dog, as opposed to just mine. Of course, when she is angry at something that the dog did, she refers to the dog as “YOUR” dog, as opposed to ours. 

In the past year, the dog has chewed up a few of her shoes, probably 2-4. This past winter, the dog chewed up one shoe in a pair of heels that she really liked, and asked me to purchase her a new pair that same day. I did this, even driving to the neighboring state that same night to get them for her. I did not resist this or push back at all. 

Today, the dog chewed up one of those heels, from the replacement pair that I had bought. 

In the past year, part of the reason why the dog had had access to her shoes was due to us not having a door on our walk-in closet, where her shoes are kept. We’ve since remedied this and now have a door on the closet, thus eliminating any worry that the dog might be hungry for her heels. In fact, we put the doors on the closet for this specific reason, so we didn’t have to deal with any more chewed up shoes. 

Her replacement heels were left out, downstairs on the floor in the office. They were not safely secured in the closet and the dog chewed the shoe up. My partner wants me to again buy a replacement pair for her. I am refusing because she left them out and did not secure them in the manner that we specifically came up with to rectify the issue. She blames me, saying I’ve trained the dog poorly. I don’t feel that this is a significant part of the problem, as the shoe chewing is rare. For reference, he’s only chewed my shoes once in about 3 years. 

Thanks for reading. I don’t feel that I’m the A here for not buying a new pair of shoes. 

TL, DR: dog chewed up a shoe that my partner left out while not utilizing the storage that we have to prevent this issue in the first place and wants me to replace the shoes and I am saying that I won’t do it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I am officially a college graduate and my graduation ceremony was this morning. I had bought the cap and gown a while ago and was expecting to go through with the ceremony, but I ended up deciding not to do it. I really dislike any situation where I’m the center of attention ( graduations, birthdays, etc.) and college has been really tough on my physical and mental health (gained roughly 60 pounds, have been having some days where I was feeling down and have been smoking weed to help cope). I live about an hour away from my family and I decided to go home the day before the ceremony.  I didn’t mention it to my mom until after the ceremony when I was already home (They didn’t know when the ceremony was going to be held because they were expecting me to tell them when it was approaching.) She was fairly upset because she wanted pictures with me at the ceremony. Previously I had told my brother (doesn’t live at home anymore) about it a few days before the ceremony, he was wanting to go but had already made plans to travel to see family and so he gave me a graduation gift before leaving. My mom and brother were the only ones I was expecting to go to the ceremony (extended family lives far and not on talking terms with my father), but after telling them they both were upset with me. After telling my brother why I decided not to go through with it he was pretty understanding and said if I needed anything to ask him. I told my mom I can still get the cap and gown to take pictures so we are going to do that as well, but I feel like she’s truly upset by my decision.

Looking back at it I feel like it was a mistake. I’ve always heard the ceremony is for your family and not for you which I kind of understood but I still went with my decision. I feel like this is just a really awkward situation, so AITA?"		1	0
c14bj3	2019-06-16 00:51:57	itsnewbsdelight	AITA for not wanting to move the light fixture in our newly renovated bathroom?	"My wife and I have been married for 8 years. It will be 9 years in January. 

&nbsp;

We have been renovating our bathroom since the Friday before Memorial Day weekend (May 27th). That means we're on week 3 of this renovation. Things have been **very** slow moving because while I'm handy, I've never taken this type of job up. I've had help from a friend who has loads of more experience. He does this for a living. 

&nbsp;

We have been planning this for months. The remodel is complete gutting. Removing the old drywall, tub, vanity, toilet, and flooring. Basically, we're designing our bathroom as it was new. 

&nbsp;

During the days I've had to work on this, my wife usually pops her head in to see progress. This is a normal occurrence. While there wasn't much to see in the first few days/weeks, we're finally starting to button up the room, with flooring, vanity and light fixture going in today. After my friend had left for the day, my wife came in and said: ""this is good, but the light-fixture is crooked"".
I measured and said light fixture is off-center of the vanity by about 3 inches.

&nbsp;

And I was gutted. Not only have we been working 10-12 hour days trying to finish this bathroom, having to re-work the light fixture is not something I'm comfortable in doing. That means relying on my friend who already has said he is busy for the next week or so. While I'm not comfortable, I do know that moving the fixture involves cutting into finished drywall. It adds a minimum of 3 weeks due to my friend have other obligations.

&nbsp;

I tried to understand her point of view. But the bathroom looks at least 1000x better than it used to. When I calmly tried to explain that I will not have help until the week after next, and what moving the light fixture to center on the cabinet involves, she insisted that she would ""not be able to look at it without constantly noticing that the light fixture is off-center."" She insisted I call my friend and tell him that we need to move it. He explained what kind of work it entailed, explained he was busy and confirmed that it would be at least a couple weeks added on to a project we were hoping to complete tomorrow. (all things I already knew)

&nbsp;

After I hung up the call, I explained this to my wife, who then proceeded to break into tears. She was upset due to the fixture being off center, and I was equally upset due to her not appreciating how much work we had both (my friend and me) put into the bathroom. She has now stepped away with her sister-in-law to go shopping.

c14b38	2019-06-16 00:50:33	UnderwaterBoogaloo	AITA for hanging out with my other friend because w/o my best friend because she doesn't like him?	"I tried to make the title as easily understandable as possible but I really just can't.

My friend group consists of A, N, and M; N dislikes A and has even stated she hates him (for reasons I disagree with but whatever, go off), anytime I try to get everyone together to do something she always pulls me aside and says something like ""You really wanna invite *him?*""

I wanted us all to go to the pool, hang out as a group of friends for the second time because we all just made up with M after he was...less than a good friend but he's back nonetheless. She made up some excuse on the fly like ""The water is nasty"" and ""Let's just go some other time"" and made it clear to me afterwards she didn't want to go because I wanted to invite him.

So, what was I supposed to do? Ditch my other best friend because N doesn't like hanging out with him? BS, so I ended up going to the pool with just A (M felt kind of hurt because he wanted to go as well, but A and M are on rocky terms and I feel like if it was just me and them something would happen) and posted it on my social media. Well, N slides up on my Snapchat post and asks why I only had A all over my story (in a really condescending tone with laughing emojis, I could feel the passive aggressiveness RADIATING off of her text I stg). I told her point blank that I went to the pool with him that day. She just said ""Oh"".

The underlying thing about all of this that literally infuriates me is that N has the notion that us two can hang out without A, because we're ""best friends"" and he should just have to deal with that. But anytime I try to tell her that A and I are also best friends she gets all snippy and passive aggressive (lowkey it feels like she acts like because SHE doesn't like him, I should also just not like him as well).

But now I'm wondering if any of my anger is even really justified. N hasn't expressed that her feelings are hurt and A knows she texted me because, surprise surprise!! she asked him (right after I texted her back) if we'd gone to the pool that day. It seems like she's jealous or entitled or something but maybe I'm doing something wrong and I just can't see it? Idk she's just being really confusing and I wish she would just tell me what she wants.

"I come from a fairly large family (me + 4 brothers) and my wife and I are fighting because I invited my brothers + spouses and mom and dad to our house to our house for a BBQ tomorrow. My thinking is that one of my brothers hosted us all for Mother’s Day and no one has an outdoor BBQ set-up like we do. 
My wife thinks I’m an asshole because she lost her father a few years ago and maintains it’s a hard day for her. We also recently found out she’s pregnant (1st pregnancy) and she’s been having a tough go at it - lots of puking and overall being tired. She hasn’t been able to keep up with the house chores and cooking like before and she feels embarrassed to invite everyone and not be able to “properly host”. I told her my family will bring everything and if she doesn’t feel up to it she doesn’t even have to come up to the roof with everyone and can stay downstairs. 

So reddit AITA?

Edit: in regards to the her staying upstairs, we live in a condo and the BBQ is on the roof. I meant she could stay in our condo if she didn’t want to join the BBQ."	Asshole	0	0

Since they have moved in it has been nothing but crashes and stomping around. Everyday it seems that something falls over or they drop a bowling ball. The walls are pretty soundproof since our last neighbor was only heard a handful of time in 8 months. It’s just a constant frustration to be hearing tons of random loud noises from early morning hours throughout the entire day. Till recently we just have been putting up with it and hoping they move out at then end of the summer. 

Here comes the potential asshole part, they have a new puppy. It runs around all the time and barks thus adding to the already loud as fuck people. Now our landlord has a strict no pets policy for this building. We’re tired of hearing a puppy run around being chased by two stomping girls several times a day.

"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 8 months and we decided to take a trip to his home country for the summer. He is from Paraguay and speaks Spanish (i am from the USA and not entirely fluent). Since we were going his parents also decided to come. I wasn’t able to afford the thousand dollars it took to fly there so I applied for a scholarship and my part of the work is to make videos about the culture. We have been here for a week and have only went on one outing. Since his parents came we have to go with them everywhere all the time, and it sucks for me because I don’t speak the language very well so i can’t really talk to anyone and mostly just sit there in silence. I’m not having the best time here and I am also getting nervous because we have not made a single film or even written a story to film and we will only be here for 2 more weeks. On top of that I also have to write two essays in the next two days to keep the scholarship. It seems like we are only allowed to do what his family is having to do, and it’s not that fun for me.

c147lf	2019-06-16 00:39:44	r3lvalleyy	AITA for never getting along with my brother?	"I have an older brother (24) and i'm (18) this year. When i was young, my dad has always bought toys/etc for me for my birthdays/christmas, effectively spoiling me in the process and thus my older brother always had a problem with me because of this.

Fast forward to a few years later, I (15), now have my own part-time job, don't depend on my parents for anything i want as i use my own money earned to buy it (except for the occasional school allowance). I'm pretty much trying to be independent at this state as i'm trying to get out of the ""spoiled child"" zone and i want my parents and older brother to look at me like an adult instead of that spoiled brat who always needs everything handed to him. 

(present time) However, that has never changed. During family dinners, we will always argue about something trivial because we (85% of the time) never get along. It's always something like i'm being a rude/spoiled child, always needing help even though i've been trying to get my ass out of this phase for around 3 years and my parents (mom especially) always sides with him about the spoiled situation (she always had a problem with it since the beginning). My dad can't really say much as he... well did spoil me when i was younger.

I'm never shown the same amount of respect from any one in my family which actually pisses me off to the extent that i really hate talking to brother especially and my intentions are just to ignore him and not go for any dinners with him and get the hell away from this family asap because it's frustrating as fuck.

He always likes to belittle/embarrass me in front of family dinners which adds the fuel to the fire. Usually, i go out with my parents for any lunch/dinners which is generally fine but when my brother gets involved. its game fucking over for the whole dinner for me.

I grew up in a chinese family so filial piety is important.. like really fucking important (tradionally). So my parents always tells me that my brother is older and he ""lived longer"" so i should try to be like him and take his advice and not try to argue with him and instead co-exist... sigh

And i admit, i know i'm not the ideal son, i do tend to be rude sometimes but i've always maintain a level of respect for everyone (respect should be earned not given.. #1 rule IMO) as long as they've treated me with respect which is what is lacking here.

Nowadays, i just ensure that i'm not in the house for more than 5 hours, i try to hang out with my friends as much as possible because they really make me feel a lot better on inside.

sooo, TLDR; When i was younger, spoiled to death. From 15-18, working part-time, trying to be independent but brother doesn't see that. Never treated the same by family after getting spoiled 10 years ago."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

This year, we’re at the town where my grandma used to live in before she passed a few years ago. I haven’t been here in so long and I was really excited to revisit the places that meant so much to me. However, my cousin, her husband, and her daughters are here as well and they’ve really directed how the entire gathering has went. 

My entire family has been catering to my cousin and her own family and I have been going along with it, but my depression has been resurfacing the more I have to be dragged along to do things that I don’t want to do. I know it makes me seem selfish, but I’ve been doing everything they want to do the entire time. When my depression resurfaces, I become really tired and exhausted. So, I usually want to sleep and have some alone time. My mom, however, doesn’t want me to do this and has been forbidding me to go into the hotel room for time to myself. But when my cousin and her family keep us waiting outside by the hotel’s fire pit for an hour while they were taking a nap when we were going to grill out, my mom says “Poor [cousin’s name],” because she looked seriously tired after my aunt and I woke her up by knocking on her hotel room door and forcing her out. 

I really feel like a third wheel and I feel as though just because my cousin has kids, it makes her own actions that are similar to my own fine, but when I do the same, I’m scolded. But, I really am starting to think that something is wrong with me. I love my family, but I want to do what I want with everyone for a change.

c146g0	2019-06-16 00:36:25		AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to shave his head because he would look like my boss at work and my dad?	"A little bit of context here. My boyfriend (23) has been having scalp eczema problems the past few months, which he’s gone to the dermatologist for. The dermatologist isn’t giving him a solution. He’s been adamant about shaving his head because it bothers him so much. At first, I was opposed to the idea of him shaving his head because, no offense, but he’d look bad bald. But I realized how shallow I was for thinking that and now I’ve told him “whatever, just shave your head.”

Now, my boss is his cousin. They have little resemblance, but I am almost certain he’d look completely alike his cousin (my boss) if he shaved his head. And from the side, he looks like my dad who is bald. I’m almost certain he’d look a little like my dad if he shaved his head. To be honest, I don’t want to have sex with somebody who looks like my boss AND dad. This is some weird Oedipus Complex confirmation shit. 

Would I be an asshole if I voiced in my opinions? Of course, his head is his own and I have no right to stop him from shaving it, but would I be an asshole for TELLING him I don’t want his head shaved? Telling him probably won’t convince him out of shaving his head and it’d probably only stress him out, but I want him to know how I feel about this."		1	0

So I’ve met this woman with a toddler and a baby on a way a few months ago. Her husband was abusive and she had to file for divorce. Hubby moved out and stopped providing for the family and paying rent and she had no job/no savings and couldn’t drive. Things were pretty bad. So,I’ve been helping her (bought her groceries several times and she needed someone to drive her around) and we seemed to become good friends and our kids played together. Yesterday she told me that she’s met these new people from Jehovah’s witnesses church and she’ll be attending their church because they offer pick up. She’s previously told me she was Catholic. I’m atheist. So, this is when shit hit the fan part. I have a huge problem with Jehovahs witnesses I’ve seen them turn someone I knew into a complete zombie fanatic who quit her job donated all her money to the church and went door to door inviting people into Jehovahs church. So, I’ve told her about my experience with JW and sent her several articles online about ex church members exposing this church but she dismissed it all saying they seemed like nice people and she would be attending this church now. I told her I can’t be around if she goes there because I believe they do more harm then good and prey on vulnerable people like herself. I know I sound like a selfish jerk but I really don’t want her and her kids to become one of those people who can’t talk about anything other than Jehovah and devote all their life to recruiting new members. She said she will be going anyway.I feel kinda hurt, she so easily gave up on our friendship for people she doesn’t know and I highly doubt they would be buying her groceries or driving her around like I do.

c1453x	2019-06-16 00:32:19	SoILikeIceCreamSueMe	AITA for asking my boyfriend to stop for ice cream?	"This happened months ago but it still bothers me. 

My husband and I were visiting my in laws from out of state. My sister in law was also visiting with her eight month old son. 

My sister in laws husband (my husband’s brother) was due to arrive a week later. On the day he arrives, my husband and my father in law drive to pick him up from the airport which is an hour and a half away. 

As they are coming back from the airport I text my husband to please stop and get some ice cream from the store that is on the way. This is AT MOST a ten minute delay. 

I ask my sister in law if she wants some ice cream and she just glares at me and scoffs “Jesus, no.” I ask her what’s wrong and she just rolls her eyes and goes into the next room. 

The guys get home and all is fine but when my husband gives me the ice cream she looks at me in a very mocking way. 

She tells me the next day that she was livid at me because 1) she and the baby had not seen her husband for over a week and I delayed that for some trivial craving 2) it was an hour past the baby’s bed time and she was trying very hard to keep him awake and I was really selfish for asking them to stop at the store when her family wanted to see each other. She was over it and laughing about it by then. 

I apologized to be nice but to be honest I think she was being ridiculous. It could not have been more than ten minutes delay and the baby was not hysterical or anything, just had to be carried and rocked. They reunited just fine. Also, she is very slim and body conscious and I think there was also a touch of fat shaming in the mix.

My closest friend has been feeling really, really down lately (more than usual) and it’s been putting a strain on our relationship. I noticed that they never start our conversations, never text me first, and never plans anything unless I suggest it.

I talked to them about it and they said that they’ve been having a hard time reaching out to people or talking to people in general because of their anxiety, which I totally get. They assured me that it’s not just me and that they love me. However, I have to admit it’s really draining to talk to them. I hate that I always have to text them first and when we do talk it’s either dry responses or it feels like I’m pulling teeth to have a conversation.

Recently I’ve been debating whether I should give them space or try and match the energy that they’ve been giving me. I feel like a dick because I know they’re in a dark place right now and I love them more than words can say, but it really hurts me to talk to them. I just can’t shake the feeling that they’re annoyed with me or don’t want me around, even I they’ve told me themselves that it’s not true. I’m at a total loss here.

So, WIBTA if I distanced myself from them/matched their energy? I feel like I’m being childish but I don’t know what more I can do that I haven’t done already.

Edit: I’ve tried everything in my power to help them and support them but nothing I do works. We both suffer from depression and anxiety, both see a therapist, and they take anti-depressants. I’ve supported them whole heartedly for years, but is starting to take a serious toll on me, which is why I was thinking about distance."	Asshole	0	0

c143yb	2019-06-16 00:28:50	McHitman	AITA For cleaning out my friends car without him asking me to?	"I've gotten a wide variety of responses on this so I'm curious of reddit's opinion. To preface, we have been good friends for three years and currently live together. He's always been a pretty messy person, and doesn't really care about his stuff unless it's something he's using currently. We have a very sharing-based friendship, i.e. always borrowing each other's stuff, he uses the mirror in my room all the time, etc, so it's not an issue of me touching the things he had in there or invading his privacy (at least not in my opinion). Important to note that he's not a random roommate whose stuff I pilfered and threw out.

Last weekend, he let me borrow his car to drive a couple hours away to see my long-distance GF. We agreed that I'd have it back on Tuesday evening (no specific time). Before bringing it back on Tuesday, I decided to clean it out as a thank you for letting me use it. Let me say, his car was absolutely filthy. Molding food in bags, trash and clothes overtaking all the seats, spilled drinks and dirt everywhere, etc. Not quite as bad as those hoarder cars you see but still pretty bad. I took a couple hours to clean out all the trash, vacuum it, wash the floor mats, wipe everything down, and organize all the clothes in the trunk. After doing so, I texted him to let him know I'd be a few hours later than I initially planned, because I cleaned his car to thank him for letting me use it. 

His response was ""Thanks I guess... would have liked to have it back earlier but whatever"". This kinda miffed me, as I felt like I had gone out of my way to do something nice for him. I didn't tell him so, that's just how I felt about it. Got the car back up later that evening and there was no issue, and he did thank me for cleaning it when he saw it. 

Some people have been saying it was a huge invasion of privacy, and they'd be really pissed if someone went through their stuff like that. Others have said that I had good intentions but went way too far. A few have said they'd be stoked if a friend would do something like that for them. So, AITA?

c142q3	2019-06-16 00:25:04	njd13	AITA for leaving my co-worker to take my break when it was busy?	"I got a job at a mini trampoline bungee stand in the mall. There’s only a max of two workers at a time and only two machines. Because of this, the line gets backed up quite a bit as there’s a small capacity we can bring in. However, even when it’s busy it isn’t hard to manage by yourself- just takes longer if you’re working alone. So I made plans early in the day to take my break at 3 pm with a friend who works in another store in the mall. I haven’t talked to her in a while and needed a bit of comfort about some things that were going on. I told my coworker, Max, about my planned break and he was chill with it. 

3 rolls around and it’s swamped. I haven’t sat down or been on my phone once. My friend shows up, already clocked out her break. She didn’t know how busy we were and I couldn’t text her and honestly didn’t think to. I mean, I did inform max in advance so I felt it’s alright to go with my plan since my friend was there. HOWEVER I figured I should double check with max. I tell max I’m leaving for my break. I ask if that’s ok. He doesn’t answer. I repeat it and he dismisses me with his hand. He stays quiet however and I ask if he wants anything. He declines and I leave. I thought he was just tired as he tends to be an up front person. 

I go on my break and arrive back in a slightly bad mood. I’m going though something with a family member right now and I was updating my friend on the situation and bringing up the topic brought my mood down. The crowd has mellowed out by now. 

I go to talk to max and he seems cold towards me. I ask what’s wrong, as max is my favorite co-worker and I’d consider us friends. He’s also very literal and I figured he’d express how he was feeling. He says he’s upset I left. I apologize to him and say I asked him if it was ok. He said I shouldn’t have left him there alone. I explained to him that it would’ve been a dick move to my friend as she already got the time off and arranged it with her co-workers who would take their break when. He says I should’ve thought more about him. He then brings up another time I left him to break in a rush. 

This peeves me off because the reference he’s making is to a time I got sick, nobody could cover my shift, and I had to leave for a bit to get water and sit down because I felt dizzy and nauseous. He seemed comforting at the time, asking if he could get me anything. But now I find out it upset him that I took a break that day? Another thing is it’s not like doesn’t take any breaks. He may not use his full 30 min (I usually don’t either but today was special) but he still takes breaks. 

I end the conversation by apologizing but also telling him to be more upfront next time. I feel super guilty still yet at the same time unsure if I was in the wrong.

c142fy	2019-06-16 00:24:11	littlemissmoxie	AITA for purposefully drifting away from my former best friend with anxiety?	"Bear with me this is long. 

About a year ago I stopped attempting to communicate with my former best friend. We had been close since we were 12 to 25. But I noticed as time went on that while I started to work towards my dreams of moving away and growing in my college/adult job goals, she never really did. She dropped in and out of college supported by her father and stayed a caregiver because it was less stressful than getting a job. 

She was filled with anxiety and depression. And while I did my best to support and motivate her, she never opened herself up to me or wanted to seek help for her issues. 

I’ll admit, I started to get annoyed that we could never go to social events or do anything that would upset her. We sometimes couldn’t even visit certain public spaces on the off chance she might see someone she didn’t care for. She would also drop classes at the slightest discomfort. 

And I was also annoyed that I had to be constantly the one to initiate communication and going out. She also never learned to drive due to anxiety so I was always the one to drive us around. 

Eventually I moved away to start a new job. Even still, I sent texts occasionally to check up on her. But responses were always short and since she didn’t like long phone convos this communication felt empty. 

So I stopped trying. And now it’s been a year. I miss her sometimes but I’ve found new people that want to experience the world as much as I do. I think I more so feel guilty for purposely drifting away from a person riddled with different anxieties. But I honestly couldn’t see a way for me to help. After all if a person doesn’t want to try to solve/deal their problems you can’t force them to.

He seeks validation from his mother and some other elders with everything he does. Sometimes this attention seeking attitude leads to him belittling my sister (14) and me (18 F). He also has some far right beliefs he pushes onto certain family members who do not fact check a lot of what he says, which adds to my discomfort of being around him.

I am currently on a family vacation with said cousin and have been avoiding direct contact with him as much as possible. It has been a nice break for my mental health issues related to his nonstop criticism of everything I do.  However, my mom has seen this avoidance and says I am being rude. Because of my quiet nature (this cousin is supposedly quiet compared to his brother) and our similar interests, I am almost expected to be close to this cousin. Another factor to this is that I am hoping to do two years at the college he is a professor at after two years of community college. It is one of the top [subject I plan to study] schools in my state, and he is actually in the [subject I plan to study] department. He is very interested in helping me with admissions and making sure my credits line up, which is super helpful and very nice of him. He definitely has times where he can be helpful and kind, but they seem to be less and less frequent recently.

I am really conflicted on this mostly because of the great resource he can be if I do end up going to this school. He’s not a horrible person and I know his mental health struggles must be tough for him, but staying around him for too long really puts me on edge. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c140sk	2019-06-16 00:19:10		AITA for being pissed off with my dad?	So Ive been paying my dad to pick me up from work and I decided to do some shopping before he arrived to get me. I walked into this store and was talking to this girl Ive been liking for months. I give him a call and tell him to let me know when he’s there and i’ll be right out. He then asks me if they have any of a certain product and I say yes and I would get it for him. I hang up and as Im going towards the checkout, he comes in and sees the girl I was liking because I told him about her, and he starts showing her my pictures and telling her stuff I said to him about her. I don’t know exactly what else he said to her because when I got to the counter, she really seemed creeped out by me and gave the vibe that she really did not want to talk at all. When I got into the car I asked what he said why he did that and he said he just wanted a store discount so he told her all the nice things I said about her. I kinda got upset because he started telling me I shouldnt care what she thinks of me and he’s more important because he’s my father. AITA for being pissed off at my dad about this?

c140da	2019-06-16 00:18:05	bbthrowawayx	AITA for asking my grandmother (~80 years old) not to come to my baby shower if she’s going to be ill and miserable?	"My grandmother suffers from pretty bad sciatica (nerve pain). She is nervous about surgery at her age and the shots she gets aren’t really working anymore. So she’s in pain a lot of the time. 

The last family event we had was my little sister’s graduation party a few months ago. My grandmother couldn’t really walk around and spent a lot of the time grimacing and needing help for everything. She had to sit up for a while and did not enjoy it at all. But she felt like she had to be there because it was an important event. 

My baby shower is in two weeks. I’m renting out a nice space at a restaurant where we can eat and play games and just enjoy ourselves. But my grandmother still isn’t really able to sit up for more than an hour at a time before she gets uncomfortable. I told her that I think it’s best she stays home and rests. However this is my first baby and her first great grandchild so she really wants to be there. When I explained my reasoning she actually broke down in tears. 

I just don’t know what to do. I love my grandmother. But I don’t want my guests to feel uncomfortable with someone there who clearly is in pain. She thinks she can grin and bear it but it is obvious that she is not well. 

Some of my family members agree with me on this but others think I’m being a witch to exclude her. 

Hoping to hear from people who don’t have any skin in this.

c13zrm	2019-06-16 00:16:22	lwa_7701	AITA in this family fight	" 

About a 1.5 years ago I had a falling out with my parents. I had known there was some tension between my parents for a long time. I also noticed my mom was never happy and was always trying to make everyone happy.The fallout started with my parents volunteering to watch our 2 kids (11 and 14) while the wife and I took a 3 day weekend getaway.I didn't ask them, they said we should getaway and they wanted to watch the kids and our dog. Note our dog gets along with almost every dog, except one of my relatives dogs. Well when we show up that relatives dog was there and my dog started barking at it and jumped on [it.My](https://it.my/) dog didn't bite or hurt the other dog, just jumped it kind of aggressively. My dad proceeded to grab my dog by the side and threw it into a chair. While my dog needed removed from the situation there are many other ways to do this without hurting [her.My](https://her.my/) dad then proceeded to scream and yell at her and she crawled away terrified. This was just a trigger situation and not why I haven't talked to my parents in 1.5 years, but did start it.I kind of lost my cool with my parents and grabbed my dog and left my parents house with my kids, wife and dog.I left in anger, maybe not the best situation.

Now I'm looking for someone else to watch my kids and dog so we can make our flight. I'm fully expecting my parents to call and smooth things over before we have to leave. No call ever happens, I'm still furious with my dad, but a call from him or my mom would have calmed me.

We take our trip and return 3 days [later.My](https://later.my/) daughter has a play and needs some shoes that were left at my parents.I go over, they are out of town.I can't find the shoes so I call my mom. She says my daughters shoes are in my truck, which they were storing in their extra garage. I go to the truck and all of the items we had at my parents house were thrown in my old truck.I called my mom and asked why everything was thrown out in the truck and she said because I told them the kids weren't allowed at their house anymore. Which I may have said in anger with my father, but lots of things get said in anger.This is where a call from them may have helped in the beginning. At this point I wanted a simple acknowledgment that my dad was in the wrong and my parents didn't handle this situation the best. At the same time I talked to my mom I admitted I could have handled it better and apologized for yelling at my dad. My parents refused to admit any wrong doing and refuse to this day to [apologize.My](https://apologize.my/) mom is now asking to be back in our lives. I think because I started posting pics of the kids and vacations and she is seeing what she's missing. You may have noted I haven't spoken a word to my dad since that day 1.5 years ago. My understanding from the few conversations with other family is my dad has zero desire to reconcile with me and my mom wants to see the kids but wants my dad to see them too.The kids never ask about grandma and grandpa.

My friends all say I look like Bran Stark and that I should go as him.

Back info: 
I have depression, PTSD, paranioa and hyper empathy disorder. (all confirmed by a licensed therapist)

Charaters:
F1 Girl who wants M1 back (16)
F2 Girl who im/was best friends with. (15)
M1 Guy who groped F1 5 months ago (20)
Me (17)

Story goes as followed,F1 brings M1 back into the friends group. Me and M1 hate eachother, because i still dont trust him. He keeps provoking me but friends get mad when i react. So lately i had it and yelled back at full force(not the smartest) then i tried to cool myself off by just complaining against F2. I said a comment which i fully regret, but also never expected to reach F1 in the moment of anger. I said ""i hope you get groped again bc apparently you liked it!?"". They know i dont mean it, also do it themselves towards me.

F2 Told F1,F1 told M1. M1 treatend to kill me.
After this i had a breakdown, because F2 betrayed me. They both didnt want to see me again, and when i asked why. They said bc of all the things i get therapy for. Being overprotective bc paranioa, being sometimes emo. Bc depresion

The comment that i mad apparently wasnt the reason. They then say i do things say things id never do. When i try and make things right they get angry, saying im an egoistic prick. I shouldnt brag about certain things. I jokingly bragged about being able to blackmail alot of people. Im just a trusted person.

Then F2 fully begins to lie to me, saying i punched in the stomach when i had a panic attack. I asked around it doesnt check out. Even now when i ask what i did wrong, something about human flaws, i just get angry responses. When i ask why they didnt tell me till now. I get answers like we didnt want to hurt you.

Did i fuck up?
Am i the asshole?

c13v03	2019-06-16 00:02:22	i_need_help74	WIBTA if I abandoned my family?	" 

For some context. My family are members of the Jehovah's Witnesses. I, am PIMO (Physically in, mentally out) because I made the mistake of getting baptized when I was younger. I don't agree with any of the beliefs that they hold, and I've been planning on leaving for a long time now. However I'm not able to tell my family how I truly feel because I'd be kicked out of the house I don't really have anywhere to go right now. You see, members of the Jehovah's Witnesses are supposed to shun those who have baptized and chose to leave the cult.

Currently I am 18 years old, I just graduated from high school, and I'm planning on attending Uni starting this fall. The plan is to get my degree, find a better job, then move away and cut off all contact with my family. I know that it's still a long ways away, but I've been thinking about how me leaving might affect my family.

You see, our family has never done well financially, we've never really had enough money for all of the things we need, and we've had to move house about 10 times now. It's obvious that my family needs financial support, I feel like if I left, it would make things more difficult, and put more stress on my older brother, who dropped out of high school and is helping out my parents by working a decent job at a factory.

Another problem is my mother. She has never really been well mentally. I never really understood what it was, but she has periods of time where she will do really well, and then all of a sudden have very violent outbursts, she's threatened to kill my dad, she's locked herself in her room screaming, more recently, she took more drastic measures, I won't go into the details, but she had to be taken to the hospital for fear of what she might do to herself. She cares about her children's ""spirituality"" and wants all of us to do will in the cult. I'm worried about what me leaving might to do her. I feel like if I left and she ended up hurting herself or someone else, it would be my fault.

And finally, I have to younger, and of course, very impressionable siblings. Honestly, I remember the hell I went through struggling to figure out who I was, and how hard this has become for me now. I really don't want them to go through what I went through, or to feel as though they have to do what our parents want them to do. Of course, if being in the cult is what they really want, then that's fine, but they need to know that they have to decide for themselves what they want to be, and not be directed by a fear of disappointed their parents. I feel as though, if I left, I would be abandoning them to this fate, because my parents would never let me contact them.

Again, I know this is still a long time away. I haven't even started school yet. But I can't help but wonder if I would be a terrible person for leaving this way."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Last week I tried to take my own life. I overdosed on pills. Don't really want to share anymore details. I have ppd.

We have a 3 month old daughter. 

Today we received a letter from CPS, as the cops informed them. And a flyer. On this flyer you could see a crying child and it had these big ass letters saying things like ""child abuse"", ""neglect"", and ""physical abuse"". Obviously none of that was happening in my case. The letter said that they are not worried and not taking any action or want to see/talk to us. I handed him the letter and flyer after I read them and he also read both of them. 

This evening, me and my SO were in bed, doing the usual playfighting before being intimate (which never happened). Halfway through playfighting he says ""I feel physically abused"". It triggered me a lot. He was saying it as a joke. I was not hurting him or doing anything out of the ordinary. I was laughing the entire time but as soon as he said that I just got angry. I said ""Maybe you should call CPS"". And went downstairs to sleep on the sofa.

Just a note, he has never in our time together mentioned physical abuse, the words have never passed his lips. I still don't understand why he said it today.  

Now he keeps pestering me. Am I really the asshole here?"	Asshole	0	0

c13snx	2019-06-15 23:55:27	crystalldaddy	AITA for getting my dad the “wrong” father’s day present and not wanting to change it?	"So I should preface this with saying I work in a fancy department store. It’s by no means well-paying but it’s slightly above minimum wage and I get a good employee discount on high end things. 

This year for Father’s Day I got my dad a special edition bottle of his favorite cologne and a set of guitar picks in his favorite color (my dad is a guitarist). All in all it cost about $70. 

This morning, the day before Father’s Day, my mom informs me that my dad told her he wants an Amazon gift card for father’s day. She offers to Venmo me $50 to get it. I decline her offer because a) I already got him a really great gift and b) my bank doesn’t accept instant transfers from Venmo (a long story) so I wouldn’t be able to use the money before Father’s Day. 

She starts insisting that I should use my own money to get the amazon gift card. I say no because I already got a gift and even though I can technically afford it, I’ve been saving money for an eyeshadow palette at work that is only on sale this weekend. Even if I return what I already got him and got the amazon gift card, it wouldn’t be in my account in time for me to get the thing I want. 

My mom gets really upset about this and starts going off about how I’m going to “ruin” Father’s Day. I’m super confused because my mom is a really reasonable person and usually doesn’t get upset about stuff like this. And I’m really close with my dad so I know he’ll love the gift I already got him. 

Is it selfish to want to get something I’ve been saving up for instead of buying my dad a second Father’s Day gift? Am I being unreasonable?

EDIT: I just want to add that both my parents are pretty great people. My dad will be happy no matter what he gets and my mom is usually super sweet and reasonable. I have a great relationship with both of them. That’s part of what makes this so upsetting. It’s SO out of character for my mom.

EDIT 2: Just so everyone knows my mom called me and apologized. Apparently she got really bad news from work and she was in a bad mood when she called me and took it out on me which she apologized for. We talked it out and she ended up buying the gift card from herself. So my dad is going to get 2 awesome gifts tomorrow and it’s all good."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c13sbl	2019-06-15 23:54:32		AITA For wanting my luxury bed back?	"Background: My mom purchased a luxury bed for me when I was in high school. Nice mattress, and the woodwork on the bed is very modern and sleek. It came with a dresser too. I moved away and didn't take it with me because it would have cost a lot to ship it out to me, and since I had not found a permanent place to live yet, it seemed stupid to keep shipping that bed around the country.

My brother, about 7 months ago, decided he wanted to use it and took everything and moved it into his room. Since he lives with my mom, I was not angry about it but I feel like he at least owed me the respect to ask if he can use my stuff. He has a history of disregarding my feelings.

Now, I am going to move back home and my mom told me that she will move my brother's old bed into my room for me to use. I respectfully asked if I could just use my old bed, the nice one, and my mom said that patience is a virtue. Aka, that is her way of avoiding a fight. There is a long history of her favoring my brother and making me put up with stuff.

I understand that she doesn't want to start any fights but why should I use a sub standard bed when I own a luxury bed. If anyone is going to use an older bed, shouldn't it be the person who had it? Just because you take a bed that isn't being used, doesn't mean that it is now yours and the owner can't have it. I can understand using someone's stuff if they are physically not there, but if they return home... doesn't it automatically go back to the owner?

I just don't see the logic in denying me use of my bed, because my sister is using it. If the roles were reversed, I would be forced to give it up for my sister."		1	0
c13s48	2019-06-15 23:54:02	sathurok44	AITA for wanting to kick my friends off of my vacation??	"We invited our closest friends on a vacation with us for several days. We loved them then, and have been close for many years. Recently the dynamic has changed in our relationship, and we no longer feel like the relationship we have with them is healthy. The vacation is in 1 month(we planned it just a month ago) and we just do NOT want them to come. We resent them more and more every time we hang out. I’ll just say that it’s not something we can fix anymore or discuss any further with our friends, so not having them on our vacation seems like something we just need to do. They’ve paid a deposit, and we can give that back to them. That’s the only prep/expense they’ve paid for the trip so far. I just feel awful kicking them off the trip. If I do, what do I even SAY?!

More INFO: When I say the dynamic has changed, what I mean is that I’ve come to a realization how toxic our relationship is with them. I’ve been going to therapy, and just a few weeks ago(just after we booked the vacation) I had a major breakthrough, it helped me to see that my girlfriend (its a husband, wife, and 2 kids) is verbally abusive to me sometimes. They are super negative people, complaining about everything, screaming at their kids regularly, etc. We consistently feel very negative after our hangouts, and it wasn’t until this recent breakthrough that I realized how unhealthy our relationship is with them. It affects our attitudes after we hang out, my relationship with my spouse, and even taints my parenting. This has been going on for a LONG time, but like I said, wasn’t until just recently that I realized it actually affects us in a huge way."	Not enough info	0	0

My parents are out for the weekend so it’s just me (m16) sister N (17) and sister E (20) at the house. 

At about 2 pm I’d decided to go for a long bike ride because it’s the first day of my summer break. I just kind of flowed with it and ended up going for 34 miles and while I am and avid cyclist, 34 is around double what I normally do on a Saturday afternoon I was back around 4:30 pretty much dead inside with my lungs and thighs begging for me to end it all.

At around six pm N came asked me if I’d support getting five guys carryout for dinner and I said hell yes because I was bombed and a burger would be amazing. 

At 7 N came in and said that I’d have to go with her to help carry the stuff. I said that all I’m really up to doing is recovering in my room and that I was under the impression that N and E would go. She said that E had to finish two articles for her uni’s paper and that she can’t go. And I said well fronk, I’d rather just make something here than go with her; all I’d essentially would be doing was sit in the car, get out, pick up the stuff and get back in but still I felt like it wouldn’t be worth it. She tried to convince me but I was too stubborn. 

She told E this and she came up and screamed at me that I was being selfish and that I’d be doing something so simple and it would take only 15 minutes. And I responded with the classic “if it’s so easy then why don’t you do it?” And she said that what she was doing was way more important than whether or not I spend 15 more minutes in my room. I asked why she was so pent up about getting five guys like it’s the only source of food and she wasn’t snacking on chips for the past 30 minutes. I then said that with all this time arguing that the food could’ve been already picked up. She then said “would that be fucking nice” and stormed out.

I write this sitting in my room just after kind of regretting most of it and I think I would’ve gone if I’d known that she’d get this steamed. But title? I think if I was judging this I’d give a YTA or a ESH"	Asshole	1	0

"Me and my girlfriend are moving together this 1st of july. We had no oven so we looked on facebook and we saw the daughter of somebody my mother knows (it may be important) selling a good enough oven for 100$. We went to see it on the 29th of may and said we would take it and pay on the morning of the 1st of july.  

Then, some majors news came up in the family of my gf and we were given for free a better oven. I was in a dilemma but i couldnt say no to this new oven. So i texted our seller back this thursday, the 13th to cancel it off, explaining briefly, saying i was deeply sorry and wishing her good luck finding a new buyer. This left her around 2-3 weeks to get rid of her oven.  

Now my gf says i'm in the wrong and wants me to  text her again saying we would take the oven and  seek ourselves a new buyer. Im against it and say it's not my problem, it's not that much of a short time and nothing was paid yet.

"Basically, after having kids so close together, I’m feeling insecure about my body. My husband is generally supportive of things that I do to feel good about myself. However, after doing some research he pointed out that this is an extremely risky procedure (which I already knew) and he questions whether I am really willing to risk “leaving the kids motherless” so that I can look better. In the end, he’s leaving it up to me, but it’s hard to get past those words. 

At the end of the day, I want to feel confident and secure with myself. Yes there is always a risk with surgery. But is it wrong for me to accept the risk to improve my self esteem just because I’m a mom?

In case it’s at all relevant, I live in Beverly Hills where going to get Botox is like going out for an iced coffee.  I know I shouldn’t compare myself to other people but that is far easier said than done. I know that this procedure, if all goes well, will make me feel like a sexier wife and a happier mom. 

But another part of me feels like maybe I’m a selfish jerk.

My wife and I really want her to take advantage of this opportunity, but our daughter is not 100% on board. She wants to, but doesn't want to do it right now. She wants to finish highschool, take a year off to work, and then go to college. 

This ""deal"" this university made with us is that she can take these classes free of tuition, even get a yearly stipend for textbooks and technology. She would effectively not only skip the $8,000/yr tuition but also receive about $5,000/yr in grants. Imagine being paid to go to school. This is all assuming she goes *now*, and not later. The college gets free publicity for having a (very) minor student, drawing in more potential students. The allure is in her age being so young.

Would we be the assholes for ""forcing"" this upon her? By forcing, we want to push hard for her to make this decision, but we'd never literally force her to go to college by way of consequences. If she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to, but we want to make her aware this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. This is something that gets you in the news, it gets your foot in the door for lucrative jobs, just by the fact you have a degree at 16. I would have done anything to have this opportunity growing up, and I don't want her to squander it away."	Asshole	0	0

Don't know her that well, but have found her a bit standoffish in the past. We were invited to celebrate with other family and friends just after the proposal and of course went to support my son. I guess during the speech my son told her that the forgot what he had planned to say and was improvising, but he had written it out elsewhere. During the celebration, she told him she wanted to read his planned speech. I found that exceptionally rude, since he put so much effort into the proposal and she was in no place to demand the ""perfect"" speech. I said something like ""isn't the speech he gave good enough? why do you need another one?"" and my son got upset with me. I was just trying to stand up for him, but my exwife dragged me out and I didn't want to make a scene, so I left. My exwife called me a name I can't say here when she made me leave and now my son isn't speaking to me right now because he thinks I made it awkward and he doesn't appreciate what I was trying to do for him.

c13kt5	2019-06-15 23:32:42	CursedChosenOne	Aita for putting a hold on my debit card that my family is using.	"So for context my family is using my debit card to get money that is coming under my name for a job where I do house work for my family. In the past we agreed that I would get the money and give it all to them for bill's and stuff while I would do the work, and eventually they just kept my card. Slowly over time I've been slacking on doing the work but they've still been getting the money this whole time. Meanwhile they are constantly telling me that I don't do anything to bring money into the house or doing a proper job on the housework (which I agree I could be doing a way better job). Also when I try to get another job i cant keep it for longer than a few weeks because i feel like I'm constantly having a panic attack. I always argue that even just receiving the money under my name is doing something but they disagree. They also have discouraged me getting another job in the past due to rent going up if I got more income, but at other times they've allowed it and I've failed in keeping it for the reasons above and whenever I brought up getting a different job they countered by saying that I'd never keep that job anyway. 

I also have been driving them everywhere since I got my license. The times they have driven themselves in the past 10 years I can count on my hands. But they say this is also nothing.

I recently put a lock on the card and told them that I wouldnt unlock it until I was removed from the housework job since I  didn't get a cent aside from being allowed to live in the house and food (which I admit is a lot)  and i wanted to get another different job and some respect. They kicked me out instead.

Today my wife decided to present me with my gift. It was a mousepad of course, but it was clearly of worse quality than my current one. Not only that it’s less than half the size. It had pictures of our baby all over it. I told her I loved it and it’s beautiful and that I was gonna put it somewhere I can see it, maybe on the fridge.

c13js5	2019-06-15 23:29:54	implicitxdemand	AITA For Asking Parents to Take Back their Credit Card From my Sister?	"Background: I'm 19, my sister is 22, we both live at home, and our family is not in a good financial situation.

So basically I've always been the ""responsible"" one in the family, I got a job first, got my license first, went to a 4-year college right away, and just handled money better. My sister has always cruised through. Working during the year is hard because we commute to our university, though I found a job in school and made some money. But currently I'm not working. On the other hand, my sister hasn't worked in well over a year and has been quite literally broke.

In case of emergencies my parents had given her my mom's credit card to carry around. She's had it for a while now and uses it regularly. My parents know, but they're total pushovers when it comes to money, even though we have very little. I've always been the ""stingy"" one.

Anyways, yesterday I got frustrated because my sister went out to eat even though she (still) has no money and there was food at home. I told her to stop being so irresponsible and spending our parents money. I came home and told my mom she needed to take the card away from her since she was using it as her own by now. Because my mom was then frustrated at her over something else she agreed. However, when sister came home, my mom did nothing and just had a talk with her.

I got really mad because even though I haven't been working either, I don't use their money. And I unlike her am actually looking for seasonal jobs, pay my own gas, and generally don't get much help. I have savings (she doesn't)  but I'd rather not use them.

They both got mad and told me to stop being so selfish, and stingy since it's not my money, and that's not an attitude to have with family, etc. I'm so unbelievably frustrated because their money habits kill me, but AITA for wanting my parents to teach her money habits?

Edit: I don't want a card, I ironically though younger have a credit card that's actually my own, the issue is more that they're not encouraging her to be financially mature"	Asshole	0	0
c13jmx	2019-06-15 23:29:27	_idk_a_name	AITA for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?	"My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.

She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c13ioi	2019-06-15 23:26:53		WIBTA for avoiding a friendship that constantly disappoints me?	"I’ve been friends with this person for nearly 13 years. She’s really great, the kind of person that everyone loves. I have considered her one of my best friends, and she’s said the same. After going to different colleges, we moved to the same city. I lived with her for a short time, and saw her nearly every day for a while after I moved out. 

Since then, I’ve found she has a habit of just... sort of disappearing. I won’t hear from her for weeks or months. We’ve had many conversations about how that’s really hard for me, because I have emotional issues surrounding abandonment. I try to reach out, but if I have to more than a few times, I start to feel ignored and really terrible. She’s always really receptive and becomes really communicative for a little while, before fading away again. 

Well, it’s been another spell. I’ve only seen her once, for a quick lunch, in the last 5 months (I didn’t even see her for my birthday), and that one time took weeks after me reaching out. Honestly, it’s caused me a lot of pain; not seeing a casual friend for months is one thing, but I thought she was one of my best friends. She lives close by too, within walking distance. 

I think she’s a really great person, but I think we just had different understandings of our friendship. I’ve been consistently disappointed, thinking that we’re very close and that I can depend on her for support, and then finding that she’ll disappear for months. It truly feels like going through a breakup. 

I’m sure that, eventually, she’ll reach out again like nothing’s wrong, but I’m tired of getting hurt. WIBTA if I avoid seeing her until I’ve been able to get over the feeling of losing a close friend?"		1	0

I’m an 18 Y/old female my parents are kinda controlling, they have placed a camera inside the house that just points at the door and the leaving room, just to see when I get home or when I go to the kitchen, and this is unnecessary because they also have automated the door with bluetooth(whenever I enter or leave the house they receive a notification to their phones) so the camera is completely unnecessary because the door already does the job. Anyways my parents always know where I am (because of find my iPhone) which I kinda understand.... The issue is that now they want to place a camera at the door of my room and I disagree, I’m tired that everything in the house is automated just to control me. I can’t move out because I haven’t graduated high school yet (the calendar here is different) I’ve tried to save money to move out but It’s not enough. I’m leaving to college in January but my parents wont let me go to a foreign college (they want me to say in the house) I forgot o mention that my parents have my phone password and my dad also controls the internet (he turns off the internet at 11pm) I always fight with him because I’m tired, I know that it is his house, therefore his rules but I think there is a limit.

c13eje	2019-06-15 23:15:04	thejohnnygrey_666	AITA for telling my friend off because she unfairly accused me of standing her up?	"  

Yesterday, my friend A and I made a plan together to drive around the city to take some dramatic photos with bokeh effects. We talked about this in our Whatsapp group chat. One of our friends, N, said that she would like to join us. And even model for us, which kind of surprised us because we had asked her many times before (She’s really pretty) and she had always said no because apparently we’re just amateurs. But no problems there.

So A said like yeah that’d be cool and that we two should come over to his place because we did not have a ride. She only lives a couple of blocks away from his house. A works at a huge company and it has happened many times that he missed or was late to a birthday party, dinner or lunch together. Nobody gets upset though because we all understand it’s his job. A said that he would probably be late again make it around 10. And I said that’s okay tomorrow’s Saturday and told him to drop me a message if he’s already home.

N apparently had missed this part of the conversation because there was a never-ending discussion about a friend’s birthday party coming up next month. She showed up exactly at 10 and when she found nobody there she got really pissed. She dropped a long angry message in our Whatsapp group directed at me, which basically said I was such an irresponsible asshole for not showing up on time and wasting her time and that my unpunctuality would take me nowhere.

I was surprised and offended by her remarks. We all know she’s always been very strict about punctuality. But I had never asked her to join us in the first place. It was herself who said that she would like to join us, and A said OK. I did not say anything. So I pointed it out to her and she said “yeah whatever. But you are also in on that plan. The fact that you are not here now when you haven’t said no to me coming with you two tonight means that we've had a plan together. And you've stood me up!” I told her that A had already told us that he would be late again and I told him to let me know when he’s already home. So I would only show up there when he gets home. And It’s not my fault that she had missed that. But she was so keen on putting the blame on me and even started to point out the times I was late to our lunch or dinner. 

I was really pissed so I told her “You know what? The plan was going really okay until you decided to include yourself in it. Who asked you anyway? You invited yourself. A and I have a very good understanding of the nature of our schedules and we are only having fun taking pictures. Stop making it sound like it is your plan, because it is not!” 

She got mad and then after another insanely long angry message, she left the group. Some of my friends thought that it was only a misunderstanding and that I should have handled it better. But i think it was really unfair of her to blame me for being late or for not showing up when it was never her plan in the first place. Am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c13e0o	2019-06-15 23:13:29	chessnbreasts	AITA ‘best friends’	"About a year ago, I had old middle school friends, well call them K and M. M was a competitive dude and K was a gentile giant. We would always get along, always respectful of each other until college.

I was just an insecure 22 year old who wanted to see more of his ‘best friends’. I was a good friend to them, always supplied a bed and food when they needed it.

Around college time, M took on an arrogant attitude. Was always asking for things but never looking to return the favor. This attitude evolved and he began to adopt a ‘manly’ mentality. He would use this to his advantage when he needed it, and abandon it when convenient. ‘C’mon man, we’re men now’ was his motto. An example of him using this to his advantage would be playing video games when he wants to and not when I suggest. Or he’ll hit me up to hang and when I say no he’ll say I’m a bitch or I never go out. I do, just not with him.

The real issue was that we only hung out when it was convenient for them. They would tell me their plan and I was either a part of it or not, no negotiation, no compromise.It wasn’t always like this. I could hit up K and we would chill, and same with M. Eventually things changed when M went to college. Anyway I confronted them with my issue and this is how they responded:

They took me to a restaurant I didn’t want to go to. The only reason we know about this restaurant was because of my friend. We had that friend serve us while trying to convince me that I was buggin, that we hang out enough. They tried to convince me things were as they always were, that I’m wrong. After that things went back to ‘normal’ and I’m still not content, I barely saw them anymore. And I didn’t have a say in anything when I did. Needless to say I was pissed, so I decided to myself heard, if they cared.

My plan was to call K and make plans the way they make plans. I call him up around midday but his little brother picks up and says he’s sleeping. I tell him to put him on the line anyway, and he does. I believe K was only pretending to be asleep so here’s what I say:

‘Hey you’re free Saturday we’ll chill then’ I say
‘I’m busy Saturday’
‘Sunday then’
‘I’m busy Sunday’
‘What are you doing?’
‘...something in the afternoon’
‘Then the morning, I’ll see you there’
‘...’

He calls me back yelling, buggin. He acts the victim, tellin me I know he can’t go back to sleep once he’s woken up. I say he’s buggin and if he doesn’t want to get blocked he’ll see me on Sunday. He tells me I’m acting childish and he won’t see me. I wait till Sunday to block him.

Then M texts me. Tells me to unblock K, I say all he’s got to do is hang out with me.  M says this isn’t how you treat friends, then I tell him this was what I was trying to tell him, that this was how they were treating me, but he didn’t care or buy it. He told me to unblock K or he’s blocking me. No real change for me, so I took him up on it, told him if he ever needs anything I’ll be right here. Haven’t spoken to him since. AITA?"

c13drs	2019-06-15 23:12:45		AITA for telling my aunt to either deal with me carrying a firearm, or don’t ever feel like you have to visit again?	So some background, I live in an area that isn’t particularly safe, and last year, my friend was assaulted and robbed in plain daylight. So since then, we’ve both gotten our carry permits since our area seems to be degrading. Any who, last week my aunt (who is very anti-gun) comes to visit me and I drive us both to lunch from my house. As I’m un-latching my seatbelt, my shirt rides up a bit, and by the slim odds of her looking right then, she sees a part of my pistol. Immediately she goes, “Oh my goodness, do you have a gun??” So I calmly told her yes, and try to explain why and all of that. It seems like everything i explained to her went in one ear, and out the other. Because for the next hour at lunch, she kept going on and on about how I need to get rid of it ASAP, and that I should never ever need it. Being very frustrated by her ability to even stop and consider my stance, I just calmly, but sternly, said that if it’s such a big deal, she doesn’t have to ever visit me again if she’s that uncomfortable. So when we got back home, she kinda stayed quiet, and then left with a quick goodbye about an hour later. I felt kind of bad, but at the same time, was very annoyed by her quick judgement towards me.

c13dp5	2019-06-15 23:12:31	FishingMonkey	AITA for losing my friend because I didn't want to play a certain videogame with him?	"So backstory, I met a guy A online roughly about 10 years ago, we played videogames together and later on another guy B joined our gaming sessions, from there on we would play games and chill in group or sometimes we would play seperately something as a duo. We were pretty solid, the three of us even met irl and spent pretty good time, so things were going good for a while, but then I noticed that I wasn't enjoying playing with guy A as much as I did enjoy playing with guy B. I still did like talking to guy A and occasionally play some random games like league of legends etc. Where mostly I had to focus on the game itself and not so much on the chatting part.

We had pretty different interests with guy A in life itself and gaming. He always wanted to be the star of the show, and he would try his best to be better than anyone else, bragging how good he was, even when we were playing with just the three of us, usually me and guy B just went along with it, silent noddings etc, because if he wasn't having fun then he would start doing the silent treatment and thus me and guy B weren't having any fun.

Fast forward to this day, there is this one game that I personally have been waiting for quite a while with excitement, it's a multiplayer game and I really want to play it with guy B, because he and I come along really well, but I wouldn't want to play it with guy A because this game means so much to me that I don't want to jeopardise the experience. But then again the guy A was in belief that all three of us would play it together. Guy B has sort of same feelings towards guy A like I do, so he kinda felt the same way as I did. 

To the actual asshole-ish deed, I came out straight and said to guy A that I wouldn't want to play this certain game/types of games with him because it means a lot to me, and that I am afraid that because of our diffrences it could ruin the experience for me. He then asked why specifically, and I answered him calmly the best I could. I told him that I understand if he is angry, and that I still would like to play games with him just like before, and that this doesn't mean we can't play other games etc. Just this one game. Well, a couple days move onwards, I don't hear anything from him untill he sends me a message stating that I am a horrible human being and even worse of a friend, and that he is cutting all connections from me, and that his hatred towards me is so powerfull that he can't ever talk to me again.

So yeah, I lost an old friend because I didn't want to play a certain game with him. Am I the asshole here?

c13d70	2019-06-15 23:11:08	mad_cami	AITA for completely cutting off my best friend after she put my boyfriend on “test”	"Hi guys. So, my boyfriend and I’ve been in a LDR for about 2 years now. I’m living in another country and he’s back home. We love & trust each other and we‘re making it work.

My best friend is also back home. We don’t really hang out together (the 3 of us) much when I’m back, but they’re both cool with each other if we do. Overall, she’s pretty neutral about him, never said anything bad, mostly some advice and nice stuff.

So, yesterday, she gave me a call and she was like “OK, gotta tell you something that’ll make you really happy”. Apparently, she went to this bar with her friend and my boyfriend was there with his friends. He didn’t see them come in and my friend suddenly came up with an idea and a plan for her friend (who is quite attractive btw) to come up to him and flirt, so they can “test” how faithful he is (?). Well, she tried, and my boyfriend just told her that he has a girlfriend, she tried pushing some more, and he basically told her off and asked her to leave. My friend told me this and ended up with how now I really have no reason to doubt him (even though I’ve never expressed any concern) and how she’s convinced *now* (??) that he’s 100% good for me & a good guy. 

She sounded really happy and excited telling me this but I was honestly pretty shocked and just told her that she crossed the line big time - that I never asked for this and not to call me/text me again, as I don’t want to hear from her. I hate the fact that she took it upon herself to play detective with my personal life. This is not what best friends do IMO. 

Well, since then, her and some of our mutual friends blew up my phone saying how I’m taking it way too far, made her feel awful, and she said I’m ungrateful and she was just “being my eyes” when I can’t be there physically. That she had the best intentions and now I’m making her feel like shit. Now, I know what she’s done is a shitty thing to do, but one of the guys who is our mutual friend told me that, in all honesty, I was being an asshole and should appreciate having someone who loves me so much that they would look after me in these situations (but like... which situations? having a social life?) and that I’m being SO dramatic over something that was not mean-spirited, but protective. I value his opinion a lot, so I’m questioning my decision to cut her off now. 

So, I would appreciate you perspective - AITA for cutting contact with her completely and making her feel bad and should I have more understanding for the fact that she tried to look after me? I’m willing to apologize if I overreacted, I just don’t really know what to think rn."	Not the A-hole	0	0

This girl, let’s call her Sarah, has been affectionate for our whole friendship (abt one year) and has always held my hand, hugged me, smacked my butt etc which i all interpreted as platonic. We’re relatively close friends, and I had absolutely zero clue she liked me until one of her friends (also a friend of mine) told me.

I was absolutely shocked, and, honestly a little weirded out. I felt a little strange about all our little interactions after seeing them in a new light and i kind of avoided Sarah for a few days just trying to figure it all out. I’m not homophobic, but having a friend like me that way felt a little weird when I’m not attracted to girls.

New week started and we had Bio first period where we sit together and she goes to hold my hand. I kind of wiggle out of the grip, fake stretch, and i leaned away when i noticed she was touching my thigh. It made me a little uncomfortable. A few days of this and she asks me why i’m acting so strange, I just told her that I’m starting to feel a little uncomfortable with the way she touches me sometimes and that Id prefer if she didn’t, leaving her quite upset. She just said “ok” then left. 

A while later I was talking to the friend who told me sarah liked me and she said I was being an asshole. She said i was perfectly fine “flirting” with boys who i knew liked me and that i was being unnecessarily cruel to sarah. 

So, AITA?

tldr i started acting weird around a good friend when i found out she liked me when i’m straight, and i hurt her feelings when i told her to stop touching me. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0
c13c2n	2019-06-15 23:07:44	COATstar	AITA for taking a shower without telling anyone else in the house?	"There's quite a few people that live in my house - a few step-siblings, my half brother, my step mom, and my dad. The water's almost always being used for laundry or other people taking showers, and it doesn't help that my siblings aren't the most clean people ever.

My step-mom takes a shower every single day, as does my half-brother. Usually at the same time (he's 4 years old and autistic so he can't take a shower on his own, so it helps to make it a two-birds-one-stone situation). My step-siblings usually go by an every other day basis. Dad normally takes his way early in the morning when no one's awake before going to work, and laundry has no rhyme or reason. If it needs done, it's going to be done. Which is almost all the time due to how many people are in the house. I'm also supposed to take a shower on an every other day basis.

Except I can't. The water being used all the time makes it nearly impossible to find a moment in the days I'm supposed to shower on without finding out that someone else is about to use the water, currently is using the water, or has used it recently enough that there's little-no hot water left. Earlier I finally found a time where everyone else was outside and playing, and figured that since they'd be out there for a while, no one else had used the water recently, it was a perfect time to just enjoy a nice hot shower. I hadn't gotten to take one in about a week, so it felt good to get the grease out of my hair.  
Turns out they ended up coming back inside a lot sooner than I thought they would. Half-bro ended up soiling himself, so they had to come in early and take a shower to wash it off.

Since I *just* got out of a 15-20 minute shower and never informed anyone I was taking one, they went in and only had about 5 minutes of warm water before it went cold. According to my step-sis, step-mom got really angry and upset about this as she had a poop-covered toddler and hadn't gotten to shave herself in 3 days, and said I have to start telling her before I took a shower now. No one else has to say when they're going to be taking a shower as far as I know, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

On one hand, the water's run cold on me several times in the past before from no one else notifying when they just used the water. I also couldn't care less about her not being able to shave for a few days since I haven't gotten the oil out of my hair for about a week. Her only having 5 minutes is ironic as the shower I'm supposed to use was so clogged at one point that you only had about 5 minutes before it was flooded, 20 minutes before it drained.

On the other hand, you can't control when a kid soils themselves, and an autistic toddler is very hard and stressful to take care of. Having a kid scream at you all the time really grinds on your nerves. My step-siblings aren't the easiest to care of either with how much trouble they cause. I can understand why she would have an outburst over a small thing from how much is pressed on her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c13acv	2019-06-15 23:02:43	justgivemebbq	AITA for congratulating my coworker on their weight loss?	"I’m at a total loss here. 

Coworker I’ve known for 2.5 years and who overshares galore is always complaining about her weight. She’s maybe 200 lbs at 5’4 so not overly large. We work in a small office and she tells all of us about her struggles. We are in a team of 8 and are all pretty closeish. 

She’s normally very chatty with me and will occasionally stop to sit at my desk and help herself
to my snacks/ look at what I’m working on/ etc so I thought we were cool. 

Over the past 2 weeks she’s begun fasting intermittently every other day and she came in today to tell us that she’s lost 13lbs. Of course that’s a huge amount in a small space of time and I said congratulations to her especially because she was super vocal about how hard it was for the past 2 weeks. She became VERY offended and said I was outta line for congratulating her because it’s not my place to make any implications about her body. 

I was thrown for a 6, ESPECIALLY when two minutes later our boss walked in and said ‘congratulations Olivia, random coworker told me about your milestone’ and she got super happy and started talking about it with our boss. I called her out on it and said how come boss could say congrats but I can’t, and she replied that since our manager was previously overweight she ‘gets it’. 

My boss took me to the side afterwards and reassured me I had done nothing wrong and asked if I was ok, but tbh I’m feeling like I’m a huge dumbass for not getting something apparently everyone else does and if I’m just an ignorant ass."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c138rh	2019-06-15 22:58:11		AITA For changing my date last minute?	"TLDR at the bottom. 

This goes back a little bit but I’ve always wondered if what I did was wrong. So to set the scene this happened during the run up to our end of year ball. Of course you were pressured from every side to take a date.

So I had been talking to this girl for a while now who, while I liked, was merely a friend due to many reasons from my naivety to her insecurities. We got on like a house on fire and would FaceTime a lot but I kept our friendship secret from everyone at my uni course and especially from my family as they weren’t fond of her due to things that she couldn’t change.

So as the ball was getting closer I was reluctant to ask her to be my date as then that would mean me revealing our relationship to the world, but when my friend asked out a girl to be his date, I cracked and decided I would do the same. So one evening I decided that I’d ask the girl I’ve been talking to if she wants to be my date as she had been dropping some hints that that was what she wanted. So I messaged her sister to find out where I could find her the next day but...

While this was going on a random girl that I knew through one of my friends hit me up and asked if I wanted to go with her to this dance as she thought I was single. So this random girl is better in every single way then the one I had been talking to so after some deliberation I decided that I’d go with the new girl. 

Of course this meant cancelling the plans to ask out the first girl. I messaged the sister I had asked for girl no.1 location and said I had changed my mind and she kicked up a big fuss and told girl no.1 about the whole situation to which no.1 was understandably quite unhappy about. Our friendship fizzled out fairly quickly  but to this day I don’t know how she truly felt about the scenario as I had mixed reports from other people. All in all I don’t regret my decision due to things that became apparent later but AITA? 

TL:DR I last minute change my date for a dance from a low key friend to a random girl"	Asshole	1	0
c13872	2019-06-15 22:56:33		AITA for wanting my wife's parents to get rid of their plants	"Okay, some context:

My wife and I just moved across the country to live with her parents because I got a nice job. She's of Asian descent, with her parents being born outside the US and immigrating here. 

They have some plants that are very sharp and covered in thorns that are about 2 to 3 feet tall from their home country. 

My wife and I have a very difficult child who gets into everything and we can hardly control child even without dangerous objects around. We have done our best to child proof everything because we know baby will find all hazardous things and play with them. 

The plants are outside on the porch, which is also where the hammock is along with a baby table. There's 4 plants like this and our baby is 2. Tantrums frequent. The baby loves being on the porch, but frequently takes a slap at the plants and I'm afraid will end up with a plant thorn in the hands, or eye, etc. 

I asked my wife if we should get rid of the plants and she got really defensive, and made me seem like an asshole. Saying I'd be taking away something that makes her parents happy. I didn't even clarify what I meant by getting rid of them (like perhaps moving them to a different place where baby can't reach) because she turned really hostile and immediately tried to make me feel bad for making the suggestion.

So after a long day of work my boyfriend texts me to come over for the night and he told me that he didn’t want to bail on his ex because he already bailed on her before. I decided that I was gonna catch the train to him because I leave for vacation in a week so I want to spend as much time as I can with him before I leave.

To be fair I am not worried that he will cheat on me or that he still wants to be with her.

I went to the women’s restroom and the stall I was in had no toilet paper, and I didn’t notice until after. It’s a very unpleasant experience but I understand that people don’t know how low the TP is sometimes so whatever. I finished my business and went up front to make my order and let them know that that stall was out of TP. I mentioned the latter first, and the person who was going to take my order walked away (but not to take care of the tp, they just kind of paced behind the counter.) Afterwards nobody would take my order so I politely said “I also want to order something,” in case he thought that telling about the TP was all I wanted to do.  He said I know but still nobody came to take my order (he was still running back and forth up front at this point but didn’t appear to be actually doing anything), so I just said fine I’ll use the kiosk. I made my order on the kiosk, got my drink, and sat down at a table. Not a second later the same employee comes to the table next to mine, loudly complaining to himself about how the people there before couldn’t even walk five steps to the trash etc etc. I understand that it can be frustrating when people don’t pick up after themselves (I’ve been a cashier too) but loudly complaining in the table next to a customer doesn’t seem like the right way to go about it, and it was hard for me to relax with him bitching. So I turned to the employee and told him that I was having an unpleasant experience there. He said “okay, I’ll talk to him” and went over to a DIFFERENT employee (he didn’t realize I was talking about him) and loudly said, “you were rude to the customer!” And I exasperatedly said “Not him!” The lady in the booth next to mine on her way out went up and quietly told him that I was referring to him, not the other employee. The people across from me were staring at me like a chicken with my head cut off, and when I called my boyfriend about it he said that I was being one of those “can I see your manager” types. AITA for this? I didn’t yell at him or chew him out or anything I just said that I was having an unpleasant experience.

c134is	2019-06-15 22:45:46	JamesKcO	WIBTA for not attending my friends birthday party because he forgot about mine?	"Sooo a little backstory... Ever since I was a kid my family has never celebrated birthdays. I've never been celebrated by my family or friends and I've never gotten a real gift. When I was a little younger i always wondered why I was never allowed to go to birthday parties or why I never got any gifts or any kind of celebration. As I got older, i started to not care and just brushed it off whenever I wouldn't get invited to birthdays or whenever I never it was my birthday and I didn't get any gifts or whatever. Furthermore I've never had a ""real friend"" or best friend before. I've never had a friend I've been able to fully trust or just someone who would actually want to hang out with me until I got to high school.

I'm not saying I don't have any friends. I do know quite a lot of people however, they are more like acquaintances than friends. They are more like people I've met through work or school and was forced to become friends with, and as soon as i graduated or quit my job, they would just be the Facebook friends that never got deleted.

So here is the thing. When I got to high school I became friends with this guy we will just call Simon. We got close really fast and had a lot of common interests and hobbies. We would hang out with each other, play games, visit each others homes etc. He is probably the closest thing I have to actually be called a close friend, however he doesn't know much about me. He might think he does, but even though we've been friends for 3 years. I've never felt comfortable telling him stuff about myself. However he knows about me never been celebrated before and me never getting a gift before. When we started getting close to each other, I would attend his birthday parties and buy gifts and shit, which is something I'm really bad at. But i realized that he didn't even know about my birthday if he didn't get a Facebook notification. I don't really blame him, since we live in 2019 and pretty everyone forgets each others birthday. However, for me, I remember everyone who i think is close to me's, birthday. Again, i don't really care about birthdays, since I don't really know the feeling of getting celebrated but it is his birthday soon, and I don't really want to go through all the effort of finding a gift and then coming to his birthday party, where i don't really know a lot of people.

Sorry if this became a really long rant about birthdays or whatever, but I've been wondering if i would be the asshole, for not going to his birthday party because of something so petty.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I should probably add that I deleted my birthday from Facebook and other social media, because for some reason i felt like people only wrote Happy birthday on my wall, because they just remembered i existed. After i deleted it from the social media, literally no one said happy birthday to me."	Asshole	0	0

c1328w	2019-06-15 22:39:10		AITA for getting upset that my boyfriend is sleeping in the same bed with a girl he’s traveling with?	"Background: we are both gay men. We have been dating for a little over five months. 

My boyfriend is in another country with one of his good friends/coworker. She is a woman. He is a gay man. 

My boyfriend has dated multiple women in the past before coming out and has even described their sex as “good.” He is 100% gay (according to him) and he only had girlfriends because he was in the closet and felt it was what he needed to do to avoid suspicion.

I just found out that he and this girl he is traveling with are sharing a small bed. I trust my boyfriend, but this rubbed me the wrong way a bit. He has said things in the past towards this girl that were inappropriate in my eyes (how she was very good looking and a few suggestive jokes when we have all hung out together) but he has assured me that there is and never was anything between them. She is in a relationship with another straight man. 

He also likes to sleep naked and he is a cuddler as it is, but in this bed personal contact is unavoidable (the bed is tiny). He told me he is sleeping with shorts on but I didn’t ask about cuddling because I didn’t want to come off as controlling/paranoid/untrusting, 

I got upset when he mentioned they were sharing a bed and showed me how small it was (he didn’t tell me upfront - I assumed they were in separate rooms) and he is telling me I’m overreacting and that I’m not putting enough trust in him.

They were decent enough friends, but had a few relationship issues that caused them to not be able to be around each other as often as they were when they were living together. Since they both live with their respective families, they would usually come over to my BF and I’s house to hang out and smoke etc. 


They went a while without talking to us, and we assumed we did something but they reached out to us eventually and told us that they had kind of went separate ways and weren’t seeing much of each other anymore. Of course we were still willing to have them over either individually or together if there was no tension. 

Fast forward to my BF’s birthday, we had made plans with them a month or two beforehand since it was out of town and wanted to make sure everyone had enough to see if they could make it. Fast forward to a few days before, and since they hadn’t called or anything to inform us they were coming, so we canceled the reservations at the venue and just went out to dinner together. They messaged us on Thursday (his birthday was Friday, we went out on Monday) asking what was going on with the party, that she had taken time off of work to make sure she could come. We told them we canceled the party because no one reached out and said they were going, and it would have been a huge waste of money for just us two to go alone. This upsets our friend a little but we all apologize and just move on.


Ever since then we have tried to make plans with them wether it be going to eat, to a bar or just chilling at home and they say sure, but the day of, when we expect them they don’t reach out to us, and don’t reply to texts until way later in the night if at all. 

This has been going on for months now, and I know that friends come and go, and they were already kind of selfish, really only reaching out to us to hang out if they wanted to come smoke at our place, since they couldn’t at theirs. Or they only accepted a dinner invitation if they knew we would be paying. 


After a while, I started ignoring their texts and attempts to make plans since they have fell through constantly for the past few months. I told boyfriend to do the same since they clearly have no interest in maintaining a friendship, but he feels bad about it. I don’t want to try and split him and old friends up, but they take advantage of his kindness, and can’t be bothered to take the initiative and make plans and follow through.

c130ck	2019-06-15 22:33:53	The_Mord_Sith	WIBTA For expecting my mum to get rid of her cat for beating mine up?	"ETA this was made while I was upset and angry. I genuinely don't want to rehome either if them, Sam can just be challenging and we've had a rough few days.


Mum has a deaf cat (Sam) who we got in November, he's almost 2 and is quite happy playing with my Male cat of a similar age.
In April our neighbours OH rescued a cat from his neighbourhood who has been a stray for 3+ years and was kicked out of her previous home because she was terrified of the new puppy.
She (Moo) has anxiety when it comes to Sam because he just doesn't know when to leave her alone. He chases her and sits really close to her hiding spot, he's tackled her and pinned her down. Today, just now in fact, he was under my bed and I couldn't get him out (he will bite and clamp down onto limbs if he's in a bitey mood, I still have a healing bite so I didnt want to stick my hand under) and Mum refused to get him out, saying ""He'll get bored or they'll scrap"".
Scrap they did. Moo was so frightened she peed everywhere and I couldn't get a grip on Sam to get him off of her as they fought under my bed. Mum managed to seperate them (I'm disabled and she is more mobile than me) and took Sam out while I cleaned up the pee and tried to tempt Moo out.
Moo is not bothered by the other cats in the house and spends her time stuck to me like a cuddly little sticky thing, she has spent half her life a stray and sometimes forgets things (like the appropriate place to go to the toilet), has had a knock with a car and broke her jaw and we suspect she has problems in her shoulder as a result. Sam on the other hand, is a biter, he is deaf was mishandled as a kitten (which made him a biter), he doesn't  understand that he needs to give the other cats space.
After the fight tonight I'm of the opinion that it's unfair to keep putting them both under the stress and one of them needs to go. I don't want to part with Moo and I think I would hate Sam if she had to go, but he was here first.
WIBTA for asking for Sam to be the one to leave? 

(I dont want either of them to leave, they both are lovely in their own ways, but this isnt fair on anyone.)

ETA: Sam has been a biter from day one. His first night with us he bit me while I was playing with my other cat. Blood everywhere. He has since gotten more bitey with people, especially if you try to remove him from any contact with Moo. 
There are other cats in the house, it was not as if Sam was living alone.
I'm disabled and cannot live alone.
It is not my mums house, it is our house. It's been adapted by the council for my use and we are both on the tenancy.

c12z3y	2019-06-15 22:30:22	Freshman50000	WIBTA if I told my friend not to move in with her boyfriend?	"I live in a house with my boyfriend, and my two closest friends, A and B. B has a boyfriend, who we’ll call C. C isn’t a very nice guy. He and B have been “seeing” each other for over a year, and she’s been emotionally invested since the start. However, it’s always been clear to myself, A, and my boyfriend that C isn’t very invested in the relationship. He blows her off constantly, wouldn’t let her tell anyone they were together until last month (ie they had been exclusive for a year already) would get upset with her if she posted a photo of the two of them, and up until recently, his ex girlfriend (broke up 1.5 years ago) still lived with him. He tends to gaslight her and tell her that she’s being crazy. What she told me once was “when we fight, I’ll be mad about something he did but then somehow he manages to make it my fault.” He also talks about how all of his exes are crazy, and he is just generally red flag city.

B doesn’t see it. Or if she does, she’s in denial. She clings to every cute thing he says, and tells us about it because she knows we don’t like him. I honestly was just waiting for her to realize how he treats her and change her mind, but this week C has started saying he wants to move, and that she should come with him for a “fresh” start. He wants to move to a city that is a 3 hour ferry and 2 hour drive away from here. B has a manager position in a retail store here, and is just starting to build her savings- so if she were to move, she’d be starting from scratch, in a city she doesn’t know (and a rural one) with no money, or job, or friends- only her boyfriend who has never been overly good to her.

A and I have been talking, and we think it’s a terrible idea for her to go. At best, she’s isolating herself into a toxic relationship that will ultimately end badly, and at worst she could be descending one level further into a potentially abusive situation. We don’t think it’s healthy for her to leave every bit of support she has, to move in with someone who has consistently gaslit her and treated her like a second option. However, I don’t know if it’s our place to say this. If we don’t tell her, I’m worried that she will give too much of her life to this guy, and he will ultimately leave her worse than when he found her. If we do tell her, I’m worried she will be angry at us (shooting the messenger) or will think we are unsupportive. That might drive her into his arms, and then when she leaves, she will leave without keeping contact with us, and will ultimately be worse off.

c12xm4	2019-06-15 22:26:11	ohjustfml	AITA for not quitting my best friend even though I'm in love with her husband?	"I've recently  come to the realization that I'm in love with my best friend's husband, but I don't plan on telling her or backing away from our friendship. If I told her, she'd be both incredibly angry (rightfully so) and also enormously hurt, questioning the basis of our entire friendship. Neither of us have many friends and we are extremely close, so losing this relationship would quite honestly be devastating for both of us. 

I'm married and while I love my husband, I'm not in love with him. However, our life together is good, we have 4 kids and we get along very well.  If I told my best friend, inevitably my husband would find out soon afterward. I don't want to end our marriage over these feelings I have for someone who is completely unavailable. 

And this man is wildly, madly in love with his wife. Even if I decided to pour napalm on our friendship and make a pass at him, it would never, ever happen. No question. So I don't want to end our friendship over something that nothing will ever come of it.

Probably relevant info, I spend a lot of time with the two of them together.  It's not like I see him in passing. I cannot imagine this changing if I keep my mouth shut, so I will be hanging out with both her and him as we already do. 

I'm aware my reasons for not telling aren't selfless, which is why I'm questioning my decision. Would it be better ... more honest for sure, but actually *better* ... to just be up front, end our friendship and explain why? AITA for keeping this from her, with the hopes that she never finds out and my feelings eventually change?

TL; DR: I'm in love with my best friend's husband and I want to pretend like that's not true so our friendship doesn't end."	Asshole	0	0
c12wgs	2019-06-15 22:22:56		AITA for ditching an Ex and a mutual friend because the ex was texting an abusive ex	"Sorry  for the long title. A bit of backstory. Me and my ex recently broke up  because she wanted to 'fix her life' by going back to counseling, going  on antidepressants, exercising etc. (Didnt think she coukd be a good  partner while she was depressed). So we officially parted ways about a  week ago.

Now I've just finished my exams  and her, a mutual friend and I all decide to go on a bit of a pub crawl  through town. The night is going great until the mutual friend looks at  my ex's phone and sees that she has a snapchat off of 'Tom'. This is a  pretty big deal because whenever the two of them talk about Tom it's  about how shitty he was to my Ex and how he was abusive and manipulative  (doesnt let you talk to other boys, checks your phone, etc.).

Now  i'm finding it pretty hard to hear this, the ex can see this and  decides to try and cheer mu up but you know when youre so upset that you  cant smile? I was like that. And so i suggested we leave the bar and  then i begin to walk home. No one likes the fact that im just walking  away so the mutual friend asks us if we can talk about it. We're both  visibly pissed at each other and I say ""why would you go back to an  abusive piece of shit like him"". She says that i didnt even know him  (this is true, my ex is 2 years older than me and most of the drama  between tom and my ex happened before i met her). So i said ""well then i  cant talk about it, ruin your life with him"" and then i walked off.

The mutual friend approached me and said that shes on my side and knows the damage that Tom has caused before.

Just  some disclaimers. She says she was talking to him for support because  she was going through a tough time and he happened to message her. I  think im so involved about this because i still care for her. And tom is  the kind of guy to call multiple times a day, email, skype call and  message every day if he doesnt hear from her."		1	0

c12udw	2019-06-15 22:17:03		AITA for going to my business' legal department without an appointment and waiting in the lobby until I was seen?	"I work at a very large business. I recently developed an app to help its employees work more efficiency. I went to my business' legal department (without an appointment) and the lawyer, Chris, confirmed there would no issues with me licensing my app to the business while I'm employed. The app works for other similar businesses so I want to license this around.

The issue is that there is a policy that any invention an employee makes is owned by the business. I had my IP laywer draft an agreement so that I can legally claim full ownership of my app. I called the same lawyer, Chris, and ask if I can get this signed. He asked if I used company time or equipment to develop the app for which I said no. He asked if it's part of my job description and I said no, but he wanted to confirm this with my boss in a meeting. Chris said that he's done this before and he just needs my boss and my boss' boss to say in an email that this isn't part of my job description, which we got done. At the meeting I gave Chris the agreement and he said he'd look into it.

A week after I stopped by Chris' office and he came into the lobby and said he had nothing for me and he'd keep in touch; didn't let me get a word in. A week after I sent an email but go no response. A week after that I called and asked to speak with him but the assistant said he was busy and asked if I'd like to set up a meeting. I said yes, but she checked with Chris, and then said he didn't want to set up a meeting and that he'd just call me back by the end of the day. Got no call back. The same the next day and the day after. The next week I had a few days off so I decided to go to the office again and just wait in the lobby until he was available. He was out of town the first day. The second day I got there before him and told the secretary that I'd just wait for him.

An hour and a little bit until he came out to the lobby very visibly upset. In a raised voice he said that it was completely inappropriate for me to go to his office and ""demand to be seen"" (I never said the word demand to anyone). That I had to change my behavior. That I can't keep coming to his office like this. I was a bit stunned so I couldn't get much out other than an apology for any misunderstanding as I was just waiting for him to be available. He ended up saying (yelling) that he wasn't going to sign the agreement and to speak to my boss about anything further. After I left I got a call from Chris' office that he wants to set up a meeting with him, me, and my boss. I'm now waiting for that meeting coming in a few days but I think I'm just going to get berated at.

I know Chris is very busy and I'm on the bottom of his list, but I think I was patient enough and attempted other forms of communication. Maybe what I did was annoying, but I don't think inappropriate or deserves to be yelled at like that. Now I'm stuck being unable to move forward with my business plans and not sure how to move forward after this."	Asshole	1	0
c12u9b	2019-06-15 22:16:38		WIBTA For making somebody sign an agreement to not use my diagnosis against me if our relationship comes to an end?	"This is probably a wierd post and I'm not sure if something like this would be legally enforceable to begin with but here goes. 

I'm autistic, ADHD, and have depression and anxiety- the autism is the part I'm mostly speaking of in this post.


I  know from experience that people tend to stop seeing me as an individual and start seeing me as just a walking embodiment of autism once they learn about my diagnosis (including family members and friends) and I want my romantic relationship to be a space where I can just be a person/partner of a relationship. 

However I also know that keeping it a secret from a serious partner would be unfair and impractical because it does impact how I do certain things in ways that probably can't be written off as just being quirky, so in order to avoid my condition being used against me by a partner or ex I've come up with an idea.

I'm considering writing up an agreement to be signed by anyone I'm thinking of committing to a relationship with, basically stating that they won't use their knowledge of my medical conditions in a malicious way during our relationship or in the event of a breakup. Examples of using that knowledge maliciously would include: using it to overrule me in major decision making aspects of the relationship, using it to exclude me/allow my exlcusion from events that a significant other would typically be invited to, using it to make me lose custody of any kids we might have (obviously the exception to that would be if I somehow become abusive- but I doubt I would be), or disclosing my condition to anybody who could use their knowledge of it to harm me or my loved ones. 

Would I be an asshole for requiring somebody to agree to these terms before committing to a relationship with them?"	Asshole	1	0

So Im 24 and my brother is 14. I’ve been at uni for 5 years and finally finished and plan on emigrating to Australia with my partner in September, however to save up until then I’m spending the summer back at my parents to save cash. 

It’s our dads 50th birthday coming up and it always been his dream to go to Rome. A couple of months back I booked my parents a trip to Rome costing £700 for a long weekend, during the time I would be at home. It’s a surprise for dad, and also my brother - firstly because he can’t keep a secret, and secondly because he gets pretty bad anxiety at night time. He has still never spent a night away from our parents, but I think he’d be borderline okay if I was staying home.

My partner has just found out he needs to move in a month, and I really want to move with him. Pick a house start our lives together. However that would mean not being there to child mind. He’s never slept over at a friends before, never mind for a weekend and I’m not sure he’d even be okay with a family friend sleeping over in our house. (He really is a normal teen just anxious about sleeping over). I don’t have holiday insurance for my parents, so if they don’t go, I lose the money. If I stay, I’m away from my partner for 3 months but I’m worried that my brother won’t cope with the weekend.

c12rug	2019-06-15 22:09:42	Bullet_runner	AITA for not helping my sister and her baby	"My sister is 38 and I just turned 30. She got pregnant and the piece of shit father wanted nothing to do with them. So my sister moved in with my parents. 
She is constantly texting, calling, me AND my fiancée to come over. Sometimes it’s to “hangout” other times it’s to help, to clean, give the dog a bath. She will send texts and berate us. If you ignore her she asks why and says “I can see you on Instagram”. 
She has called me a numerous amount of times about how my dad is awful and loses his temper. That’s true but they’ve always bumped heads. Truthfully my dad might have aspergers, he has anxiety and is ocd. 
She’s called crying because she’s alone and wants us to come over. My sister has a history with being absolutely manipulative and bat shit crazy. We want to avoid her whenever we can. But this is what ends up happening.
Today she called because there was man outside and she’s home alone. She’s crying because of what would have happened if she didn’t lock the door. I asked if tried to get in and she says she heard a “noise”. She called the cops, she called my brother. She was sobbing on the phone. I told her I couldn’t come over, my fiancée is sick and I don’t drive. The cops were already on their way.
And honestly I did suspect that shit maybe she was lying. She actually has gone the extra mile for attention. I don’t want to think it because she has always been scared of being alone. 
She has so many friends and they basically all have kids. She’s been treating me AND my fiancée terribly. It’s like she wants us to fill in for the father. I’m not his dad. I can be there for help sometimes but it is not my job.
My mom takes care of my brothers son and now she has the baby. My sister is constantly trying to get me to go over and help because she feels bad. She wants me to help so that she could feel better about her situation.
Her whole thing is “I’m alone. No one helps me.” She has so much help but she needs to be an adult. She’s 38 not 18. She’s a manipulative person and I can’t keep dealing with her tantrums and control issues.

He hasn’t been deployed, is living in another state at a base for the rest of his time in. I (23f) and brother haven’t always had the best relationship, however right before he left I thought we were growing closer. I came out to him (I’m a lesbian) he was supportive all was great. This last winter he was home for Christmas and he was a different guy. I had dinner with my family and he spent the dinner talking about how “lesbians shouldn’t be running for office” because it’s not Christian, saying racist things, talking about how parents that get divorced are ruining society. I come from a very “Christian” and conservative family, so wasn’t surprised but thought he wasn’t like that. I decided to leave earlier than expected and he told me I “ruined family dinner” saying I disagreed with him. We didn’t talk. 

A week later, it’s Christmas. My brother and his wife have two dogs, I have one. My brothers wife is super protective of her dog. We kept the dogs fairly separate for much of the day but my brothers bigger dog and my pup got along well. My family left to see my great grandma and were gone for about 4 hours, then my parents and I returned back to the house. My brother and his wife decided to go shopping and out to eat, and were gone for another 3 hours. Their dogs were freaking out in the kennel so my mom and I took them out. My dog and his big dog played, the little one sat on the couch by me, all was fine. 

Until my brother got home and freaked out we had taken the dogs out. He was screaming at me that I was irresponsible, had risked his dogs lives, that my dog was an awful animal, could have killed his dog, etc. I apologized for taking the dogs out of their kennel without asking. He said it wasn’t sincere enough and got in my face screaming at me, and threw a bag of cow tags (think plastic squares) across the room. I ended up taking my dog and leaving my parents house. We haven’t talked since. 

In a week, he’s coming home for a week. My mom wants me to come visit for a day. The day she planned is a weekend day I had planned with my friends to go out and celebrate me graduating grad school and quite frankly, I don’t want to see my brother.

Disclaimer, sorry for the format, I'm on mobile.

So I've (17F) been going to therapy for severe anxiety and psychotic depression (I am diagnosed with these issues). After 3 months of therapy, I started taking amitriptyline for insomnia issues. My issues were rooted in the fact that I couldn't stay asleep and that I would have a hard time sleeping. 2 months into treatment, I've been able to fall asleep within 20 minutes and stay asleep until I needed to wake up. This is the best sleep I've had in a long time.

Now here's where I might be the asshole. I'm supposed to be taking these pills 2 hours before I fall asleep, I take them at 10pm because quite frankly I'm okay with sleeping at 12am when I wake up at 9am. However, my mom (41F) has been really pissed at me because I'm not going to sleep earlier. She's also been really mad that I stay up taking with my boyfriend (we stay up around usually 11pm-12am, but never later than 12:30am). She only knows that because when I get a call or call someone, she's get a notification on her phone. But, to me, my boyfriend is the only person that I feel comfortable talking to, he knows how my mental health is doing and he supports me. So our phone calls are really important to me.

But, according to my mom. I've been breaking my treatment plans and that therapy isn't helping me because she's seen no results and I'm not sticking to the plans.

c12fof	2019-06-15 21:36:10	immapikachu	WIBTA for going on vacation while my grandma is having surgery?	"My grandma hurt her back about 3-4 months ago. Rather than go to the doctor's immediately, she hoped it'd just work itself out. After a month or so, it wasn't getting better. It was actually getting worse. It got to the point where an ambulance had to be called and they took her to the hospital. While in the hospital, the doctor said that she is going to need surgery to correct it. (Many basically unknown long-term back issues that decided to attack all at once. Degenerative disk and pinched nerve to name a few.) She didn't want to do surgery, so left the hospital after getting something to help with inflammation (cortisone shot possibly?)  to see if that would help. It didn't help. After about another month of waiting, she finally decided to schedule surgery. It'll be happening while I'm supposed to be away on vacation.


I've had this vacation planned and paid for since the beginning of this year. It's basically non-refundable at this point. This is a solo vacation, she wasn't going to go with me anyway. She and her older sister (my great aunt) are trying to guilt me into staying home because ""something might go wrong during surgery and you need to be here to support your family.""


I told them that had she scheduled surgery when the doctor first suggested it in the hospital, she could already have been into recovery by the time my vacation started. Since she kept putting it off, it's now going to be right after my vacation starts and I'll already be on the other side of the country.


We're a pretty close-knit family, I understand why she wants me to be with her. However, the rest of my family will be there and they can keep me informed. My great aunt is continuously trying to guilt me into staying and making me feel like I'm not a good granddaughter if I go on this vacation instead of helping my grandma. My grandma has mostly given up trying to guilt me and says she understands, but she still acts kinda pouty/upset when I visit her.

c12e7d	2019-06-15 21:31:58		AITA For casually dating someone after being asked out by someone else?	"On mobile, forgive me.

Context: I'm a 26f. I have a main group of friends that I've known for a long time that is a good mix of guys and gals; we'll say 60% guys,  40% girls. We've been friends since middle school, so about 15 years, and i have never had any romantic feelings towards anyone in the group.

I recently had a messy break up. I'm fine, just wasnt actively looking to put myself back on the market so soon.

A member of the group, Josh, messaged me one day and asked if I'd be interested in getting to know each other a little better. He was very sweet and respectful and just seemed to be looking for us to talk more frequently one-on-one rather than in a group setting. I had to decline, and explained because of the circumstances of my breakup, i wouldn't feel confident starting something new. I didn't flat out tell him that I can't see myself dating anyone from the group, just said I wasn't ready for anything. He took it really well.

I should also mention I had been helping plan a surprise going away party for a coworker who has no ties to this friend group. During the planning, I'd been in contact with, but had never actually met, the coworkers mom and cousin. 

The day of the surprise party comes and I'm at the mom's house helping set up. The cousin, Aaron, shows up shortly after me and... he's cute. I smiled, introduced myself, and got back to blowing up balloons. The party was great, coworker was totally shocked, and I spent a decent amount of time talking to Aaron that night.  

The days following the party, Aaron would text me and we'd carry on some good conversation. He invited me to a small party at his friend's house. I went, it was very nice, and at the end of the night he asked me if I wanted to get dinner sometime; I did. I like him a lot and I guess we've been casually dating for a few weeks.

My main group of friends had a beach trip planned, Josh said he couldn't make it. I decided to invite Aaron. If Josh had been there, I wouldn't have invited Aaron, I wouldn't want to rub it in his face.

Last minute Josh was able to go, but Aaron and I were already en route to the beach when I found out. 

While at the beach it was obvious Josh was a little hurt, but neither of us said anything about it. We all ended up having a good day and it seemed everyone went home happy.

c12dq2	2019-06-15 21:30:44	ohliviers	AITA for encouraging my 15 year old son to ditch his final exam?	"My son is in his last year of lower secondary school, and his grades determine which upper secondary school he will get into.

At the end of the year, the students get a final grade between 1 and 6 in each subject, 6 being the best. When it comes to the exams, it's completely random which subject you will have to take your exams in. It's a poll, and you have one random written exam, and one random oral exam. You get to know the subject just days before the exam takes place. 

My son is an average student, but has always struggled with math. We found out he has to take his written exam in math. The grade you get on your exam is based solely on that one exam, but counts as much as a final grade in any subject. His average as of now is 4,4, but if he does bad in his exams it might drop to 4,2 (still on a scale from 1 to 6.) This could very possibly determine if he gets into the school he wants to or not.

If he is sick and can't attend his exam, nothing happens. He doesn't have to retake it. I think the system of random exams with such an important grade is completely idiotic, and I don't support it. I encouraged him to fake being sick, get a note from the doctor and ditch the exam.

My wife is furious at me, and says we have to teach him to be honest and never cheat. I think we should teach him to do what's best for him and his future.

So as the title says, she double dips stuff, like crackers or fries into dips. We'll be at a get together or out at a restaurant sharing appetizers and she'll just smoosh her half eaten fry back into the sauce/dip. 

She also has these super long acrylic nails that she'll dig into the dip if she drops her chip. I know that she gets the dip under them because she'll lick them to get the dip out. Then she'll wipe her fingers on the couch, even though the host has deliberately given her a napkin because she's noticed her wiping her hands on the couch. 

So, once we've seen her contaminate the dip my other friend and I will stop eating it and Emma will polish it off. Kinda sucks when we're all splitting the cost.

But she called me up and said they were coming by right now! I asked her not to because of what I had going on and she sort of laughed it off and said they'd be here in 15 minutes and hung up. I got a bit mad but called her back and explained politely the situation and my shows and dinner, etc and maybe another time? She sounded all put out and I could tell she was pissed off but said OK.

c12be0	2019-06-15 21:24:23	Panic_Inc	AITA MY friend left me in Venice	"My friend left Venice over what I assumed was a jokey comment between friends.

&#x200B;

So we decided to take a little minitrip to venice, unbeknownest to me she booked a bunch of train tickets and other stuff that totallted to like £250 without asking me about the price ect, which I didn't really kick up much of a fuss about which I could have but I didn't because hell we were friends and I don't care all that much about making unneeded drama. (This is relevant later).

&#x200B;

However, when we were in Venice, she started getting visibly and audibly annoyed that I'm taking pictures and and asking her to take photos of me. After a few times of her rolling my eyes at me, I make a jokey comment saying 'that's not very lady-like'.

&#x200B;

2 days later she brings it up after what I assumed was a perfectly fine day out mentioning I've been sexist and rude. And I'm just like ????? She brings that up and I almost didn't even remember it because I just assumed she knew I was joking.

After that we get into a little argument and she storms out of the hotel room, comes back 30 minutes later saying she's leaving on the next flight home.

&#x200B;

I'm like, whatever, do as you want. She then starts saying I walked off from her (I walked up some stairs to take a picture and was gone like 5 minutes tops. She literally stormed off from me in Florence because she didn't want to wait to get into the Pallazo Vecchio. I mention this to her and she just drops that angle entirely, shifting back onto my 'sexist' comments.

So then I bring up the whole train situation, telling her she probably should have checked with me about costing since I'm just at University right now and money is still kind of tight. And then it just devolved into a huge bickering fight and she just got her shit and left for the airport leaving me in Venice.

&#x200B;

Was it really on me that she over-reacted to my joke and left me in Venice by myself over said joke?"	Not enough info	0	0

c12b7j	2019-06-15 21:23:54	atx78660	AITA for telling my sister and her husband they can’t tag along on a vacation	"Background: Every year, my husband, my son, a few family friends and I take a trip to the Caribbean to decompress and relax on the beach. Just good company, having some drinks and laughs for a few days. 

My sister (we’ll call her Mary) and her husband (we’ll call him John) recently moved to Orlando (about an hour away from where I live) all the way from California. I see her much more often and we get along really well, so I’m thrilled to have her nearby. The problem is John. He drinks like a fish and makes everyone around him uncomfortable. It’s gotten to the point where family friends avoid coming by when they know he’s visiting. He’s also extremely immature and once got in a shouting match with my son because my son wouldn’t give up the bed when John was visiting. John claims he is “older and therefore deserves the bed over the couch”. John also said some not-very-nice things and is still salty and hasn’t apologized. 

A few weeks ago, Mary found out about this year’s upcoming trip and basically invited herself and John. My heart dropped, especially knowing everyone going on that trip dislikes being around John. The hotel is all booked up, so they wouldn’t be with us 24/7, but they’d still want to do meals and all daytime activities together. 

I’m not one for confrontation but I finally built up the courage to tell Mary that I’d prefer if she and John didn’t join because John creates friction with everyone and the vacation would not be relaxing for anyone. I know she knows about his drinking problems and that he is an offputting individual for most people, but I understand as his wife, she defended him. She didn’t take it well and yelled, claiming I preferred friends to family and she’s not sure why she even moved nearby. As a side note, there was a CHANCE John would not have been able to make the trip but I didn’t want to roll the dice.

First I’ll give you guys some backstory, my grandpa died today (he’s 85 and has had heart problems and other things) and my Dad decided to go to my grandparents house to help out while  his sisters are going there to help to. My grandpa also died at his house alone (my grandma is at a nursing home) and the nurse that takes care of him called the cops and they broke down the door to his house to get in. He then asked me to go even though I’m too young (19) to deal with something like that and it’s the first time anything like that has happened to me. I also had to pack my things and we probably would be there for like a week. I got pissed and yelled at him about it (which I deeply regret) and said I’ll go to my mom’s instead (My parents never got married and I live in two different households). I also got mad that my sisters and step mom weren’t coming as well and why I was the only one chosen to go (which felt like a lot of pressure on me) because, they’re too young (ones 13 and one’s 16). I decided to not go because, it was too much for me, I couldn’t deal with the stress of my aunts crying their eyes out and my dad having his short temper like he always does and probably getting mad at me if I mess up trying to fix the broken door to my grandparents house after the incident, it’s also the first time it’s happened to me and I’m still shocked that he’s gone and I don’t know how to get over the fact that he’s gone besides probably not thinking about it and focus on other things. I really should have gone but, it’s really too late now. Am I an asshole for not going and am I an asshole for being like this during that time? Too me personally I sure feel that way.		1	0

c128vm	2019-06-15 21:17:28	AtomikRadio	WIBTA for approaching apartment management over concerns about a special needs boy in my complex?	"I live in an apartment complex with ~70 units, many rented to families with young children. Our ""parking lot"" is a road that snakes through the complex with cars parking on either side, so cars are regularly moving through the lot.

About 4 months ago I began to notice a new young man outside, I would guess this kid's 13-15 years old. I noticed him right away due to his weird behaviour: He would walk slowly around small areas of the parking lot at the rear of the parked cars rather than on the sidewalk, he would occasionally break into a skip or run seemingly without looking around for cars, he clearly was ""wandering"" as opposed to going somewhere, and he had humongous headphones on. I *think* the headphones play music or white noise based on the wire coming out of them, but they may also be for an auditory stimulation reason. He walks with a hunch and his wrists flexed inward and arms sort of moving around ""randomly."" These reasons are why I assume he is special needs/ASD.

I've worried about him ever since I've seen him, I never see an adult nearby and I worry he's going to get hit by a car. However, he's quite tall for his apparent age, ~5'6-5'9"" so I was pretty sure reasonably-cautious motorists would see him, so I was going to follow my ""let people do as they wish, it ain't hurting you"" mindset.

However, as of today I noticed he was *sitting* hunched over, in the middle of the roadway around one of the few low-visibility turns, looking at the ground in a patch of shade which made it difficult to see him. It would be *outrageously* easy for him to be hit by a car. Shortly after I noticed him, a car honked and he moved to sit on the curb.

Basically I'm worried af that this boy is going to get hit by a car. *But* I live in the same area as a lot of those busybody white people calling the authorities on black people minding their own business, and I don't want to be part of the problem. I don't want him or his parents to get in trouble, I don't want him to have to spend his days indoors, I don't want to inconvenience his caretakers if the apartment demands they supervise him outside, etc. I honestly don't know what can be done. I just don't think I'd be able to live with myself if he got hurt. WIBTA if I approach apartment management about it?

(I don't know which unit he lives in, and like I said, he's always alone.)

**TL;DR** Special needs young man wanders outside in a way that puts him at risk for being hit by cars. Want to make sure he's safe, but don't want to cause problems for anyone involved. Should I talk to the management or just let him be and hope motorists watch out?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c128c7	2019-06-15 21:16:09		AITA for telling my roommate I'm going out of town but actually will be staying home...	"I'm having a very contentious ""break up"" with my roommate. He is about $700 behind and rent and owes me a further $1000+ for money I've loaned him. I was willing to take the loss on the money he owes me just to have him gone but he's been completely insufferable while I've gone out of my way to be polite for the sake of not being stressed out at home while he finds a place. I'll take him to small claims court for the rent and money owed (Yay documentation!!) but for now I'm just keeping quiet. I never told him I'd forgive his debts, anyhow.

I was supposed to go out of town next weekend and he knows it. He now told me that's when he'd likely be moving out. Now I'm no idiot, so I'm not willing to let him have free reign over the house while I'm gone. His belongings amount to clothing, a laptop, and an old mattress. The bedframe, dressers, and desk in his room are mine. The rest of the items in the house are also mine: all kitchen stuff, bathroom stuff, furniture, etc. Plus, I'll have to change the locks and all of that stuff if he is leaving. 

The way the house is set up, I can come and go from my bedroom without him knowing. There's a shared bathroom but my neighbors are amazing and have said I can use their guest house to do bathroom things during this time. I plan on sending my dog off to a friend's house, parking my car on a different street, and secretly living in my bedroom that weekend. I also got security cameras for inside and outside but I haven't set them up, and disabling them is as easy as unplugging the modem so I don't want to take the chance. Plus, if he does take stuff and pack it I won't be able to tell from a camera, and any of the bigger stuff will have to be recovered and I don't want to go through the whole process with that.

So, will I be the asshole if I quietly pretend to not be home and then come out to monitor his packing/moving? One of my friends says it's ""creepy"" but everyone else seems to think it's a good idea. I'm torn."		1	0

I am a gay 16 year old girl, and my friends (also my age, female, and LGBT) want us all to go to pride in New York City. They are really excited about it, but I don't know if I want to go. I have always had trouble with loud noise and crowds, and I have had to leave events in the past due to anxiety. I have gotten better since then, but I am still bothered by noise and crowds. NYC is an hour away from where I live, so it's not like it would be a simple thing to leave if I needed to. I'm also generally introverted, and while I am proud of being gay, I have never personally felt the need to go to an event like pride to celebrate it. Maybe it's because my family and environment have always been accepting of my sexuality, unlike one of my friends who wants to go. She has recently dealt with her family having a lukewarm reaction to her coming out, and she has always been very vocal about her sexuality. I know that the first pride was a riot and other things like that, so does not wanting to go celebrate my sexuality make me a bad lesbian?

It wasn't all bad, but sharing a bathroom with an entire floor and no privacy wasn't ideal. The middle of last year, I agreed to live on campus with two of my friends, with a caveat that we picked a dorm with a private bathroom. I really didn't want to live on campus, but my friend did so we went that way. I found out my other friend needed room mates and I found a last minute, fourth room mate in my class, a guy who I had talked to for a bit and seen around campus a lot. At that point the plan was rooming with my two friends, and my really cool fourth classmate.

&#x200B;

Now, our school has extended the deadline for canceling the housing contract  and me and my two friends agreed we no longer want to live on campus. However, my old classmate is on a scholarship for free on campus housing and off campus is out of his budget.

I don’t think that’s fair to me, considering how often I give him my undivided attention to listen to his problems.

When we hang out in person, it’s always super fun. But we rarely do it nowadays. He’s flaked on me multiple times now, and it’s discouraged me from trying to set up other opportunities to hang out, and he almost never tries to do it himself.

So basically, he uses me as his personal therapist, we mostly text (which I hate), we only talk on the phone to talk about problems, and we hardly ever hang out in person nowadays. If my relationship with anyone else was like this, I’d have ended it by now. A friendship is a symbiotic thing, and I don’t feel that I’m getting as much out of it.

But he’s so freaking depressed, and his circumstances are admittedly terrible. Maybe that’s why he can’t give as much to the friendship, and I’m not being understanding enough. Or maybe it’s not an excuse, and I should stop letting it be. I don’t know. What do you guys think? WIBTA if I let him go?

(Btw I have communicated a few of my issues to him, and things were better for a little while, but then it would go back to how they used to be. Nothing ever stuck)"		1	0

 I talked to a few people about it, and they were all confused as to why I wasn't asking them to pay a part of my rent also. seeing as they're going to share the one room, they were going to split their rent 50/50, while I have moved out, still paying the full amount of rent.

c1219x	2019-06-15 20:57:07		AITA for being open about how weird the age gap between my sister and her husband is	"My sister (22) got married to her husband (43) a couple weeks ago. They've been dating for 2 ish years and I've met him twice: once when they announced their engagement, and then at the wedding. He is wonderful. He isnt condescending, he has a steady income, is intelligent, and has a long career ahead of him. My sister is also all of those things. They're great together. This is why I think I'm the asshole.

My issue is that my parents have always been dead set on letting us make our own decisions. They're great parents, but sometimes they get so focused on that algorithm that they dont ask questions. They were both gushing about him after meeting him once. When I asked about how they feel about the age gap, they give wishy washy statements about how my sister's always been an ""old soul."" I think that answer is BS. She's smart and mature and all, but she's still my young goofy sister.  I've cracked a few jokes about it, even with my sister, but I've never said anything negative. There isnt anything negative to say.

Well after we came back from the wedding, my mom was SOBBING. She had never shown any hesitation about this wedding until the night of. It has been weeks and she's been crying every day and she doesnt know exactly why. My sister doesnt know about that, obviously. I havent asked my mom about her concerns about the wedding since, because clearly shes FEELING IT. Or something. We dont know.

Anyway. Am I the asshole for trying to get someone to acknowledge that the age gap before the wedding and then once the actual wedding made reality hit, I'm kind of... angry(?) At my family. For not being vocal about any concerns? I'm scared this will cause major rifts in the future. And I feel like if they took my bait we could've aired out whatever emotional explosions are happening."		1	0
c1218f	2019-06-15 20:57:00	AcesInThePocket	AITA for wanting more from my wife and her live-in brother?	"This seems so cliche. My wife and I bought a house together several years ago. We bought it large enough to accommodate her brother. 

The brother lives with us.

He does not work, and gets high all day. Hey, I love to get high too. But I have a job. 

He has very, very basic responsibilities around the house. He does the dishes, turns on the roomba, and feeds the dogs. Takes out the trash. That’s it. For this, he lives in a beautiful home, with full internet, 80” TVs, A/C, the whole nine yards. 

For a long while, this seemed ok. I would do the vast, vast majority of the maintenance for the home. 

Air filters, picture hanging, about 40% of all the cooking; maintaining all the technology; bedroom maintenance, the list goes on. 

Also, he is a large man, and I have to continually fix things around the house because of his largiosity. Chairs are broken, the bannisters for the stairs get ripped off the wall from the hanging on to assist his accent. It’s a pain in the ass sometimes. 

I didn’t formally talk with my wife about the matter, but now I am quite vocal regarding my needs in the relationship, chiefly among them is that she needs to take care of her brother’s financial impacts on us. 

I have recently insisted that she get a maid to handle all those areas of the house that need cleaning (the things I can’t / won’t do).

When I moved in two years ago, I placed a wind chime on my covered front porch.  It's not very windy here most of the time, so the noise it creates is fairly subtle.

I have a new neighbor who moved in across the street and over by one lot.  They stopped by yesterday, knocked on my door and told me my wind chime is disturbing them.  Their house is well over 300 feet from my front porch, and is separated by a forest and a busy road.

I apologized for their inconvenience and took it down, but it really pissed me off.

I decided  this morning to re-hang the chime on the back side of my house because I like it.  Now it's separated by my house, hundreds of feet, a busy road and a forest from the neighbor who complained.

Guess who just stopped by again?  They were walking down the road, heard the chimes and decided to double dip on their complaint.  The discussion became a little heated, but civil.  I told him I'd think about it.

Some quick backstory:

My girlfriend of two years has a best friend that she has had way longer than we have been dating. About a year ago, her friend found a guy that makes her really happy and they’ve been dating since. It makes me happy that she did find someone who can genuinely make her life better.

Problem - I can’t stand the guy. Just something about his personality rubs me the wrong way. He is very opinionated and instead of having constructive debates, he devalues other opinions and makes the other party feel dumb. We’ve hung out a couple of times, and each time is worse than the last. It’s just so frustrating to interact with him. Other people have said similar things about him.

Now my GF wants to invite them over for dinner and games, but I have a feeling it will all end badly again. They say we can make amends and maybe even get a friendship out of it. I have expressed my dislike for him multiple times. 

So AITA for not wanting to hang out with the group solely because of him? I know that it’s possible to reconcile with some work, but I really don’t want to. I am able to be civil when he’s around as to not show my frustration, but it’s never a good time."	Not enough info	0	0

A few months back, she found out that I was sent $800 because I get text notifications from the bank and she saw it. She started begging me for $80 to cover her gas for a week and when I said no she took out her bible and began reading about how it is good to give or whatever and that really rubbed me the wrong way. Fast-foward to yesterday, she was telling me how she wanted to try this new drink and how she only had $2 in the bank. I Just ignored her. Later she called me on her way to work telling me how she bought that new drink but now she needs $2 to cover the service fee for her bank so she won't get charged an even bigger fee.

c11ul0	2019-06-15 20:38:48	puffpastry2001	AITA for not believing someone when she told me a specific song was played at a relative's funeral?	"Starting off, this happened about three or four years ago. I was living in another town at the time and my siblings made friends with some local kids. One of their friends was a girl around my age. Let's call her Sam for anonymity's sake.

&#x200B;

One day I was sitting on the couch listening to new songs I had found. Sam was sitting next to me and stated - slightly rudely, but I understand if she was very emotional at the time - that the song I was currently playing had been played at a relative's funeral and that it makes her sad. The song in question was Little Octopus by Parry Gripp.

I didn't want to make her cry or anything so I turned it off, but in my mind I didn't believe her and suspected that she just did this for attention. Sam wasn't the most trustworthy person, but other then that I had no reason to think this. The song was very cute; but I couldn't see it being played at a funeral, unless the funeral was for a little kid.

&#x200B;

I didn't tell Sam that I didn't believe her and went on with my day, but this incident stuck in mind. My family has since moved out of that town for unrelated reasons and I no longer have contact with Sam, so my suspicions will remain neither confirmed nor denied.

&#x200B;

Does not believing Sam make me the a\*\*hole?

Update: Thank you all for your input. Looking back, I was extremely wrong to judge Sam like this. In the future, I'll do my best to not judge people like this again."	Asshole	0	0
c11u19	2019-06-15 20:37:14	ahayesden04	AITA	This girl and her dad came into the bike shop I’m a service technician at. The girl had bought the bike less than a month ago, and she was having an issue with the front brakes. She had spun the handlebars around bending the noodle for the rim brakes and also kinking the brake cable. So with the extra tension from the twisted bars the cable was pulled enough to engage the brakes on the rim. Clearly this sort of thing was accidentally done when transporting or storing the bike, I couldn’t even say it was a bad fall and she spun the bars on accident because there wasn’t a single scratch on the bike. After the quick diagnosis I tried explaining this to them, the whole time the daughter didn’t even acknowledge that I was talking let alone look at me but the father was. So I started talking to him, when I left to go get the parts that were needed to fix the problem and came back the father was gone. She said to me “listen I don’t know why you’re only talking to him but this is my bike so you need to talk to me, I don’t know if you just assumed or something” I said “I’m sorry I was just talking to who was listening to me I didn’t mean any disrespect by it” then she asked me what the problem was, only to prove that she was not listening to me. On top of that she goes “well this is a new bike so I don’t think this should be happening why should I have to pay for the repairs?” I said “this may have been an accident but it doesn’t just happen from riding the bike, there is no reason for this bikes handlebars to have been spun around completely. Not even if you took a really sharp turn” my boss sensing the trouble popped up out of nowhere and gave them the repairs for free. AITA for trying to charge them for something they blatantly didn’t care enough about to even notice they ruined? Maybe if I could tell the bike had been in an accident then I would have tried to warranty the parts because I can understand a bad fall can leave you disoriented. Also AITA for talking to the person who was paying attention to me? I assure you I didn’t talk to the father because I thought anything negative of women, I work with thousands of woman customers and I have never once had an issue as far as this sort of thing goes.

I have my senior kid wrestling another coaches kid, in the consolation rounds. My kid loses, and I take him to the side to console him. After a minute trying to calm him (kid was crying and got injured), I hear a voice behind me. It's the other coach.

""You the head coach?""

He repeats himself, because honestly I don't see or hear him. I affirm I am, and he says:

""Never tape one of my wrestlers again. I'm only going to say it once. That's bush league"".

He walks off, and I'm still consoling my kid. I walk my kid over to the trainer, and I go to seek out this coach, because I'm pissed. Not by what he said, but because he thought the right time to do that was when I was taking care of my kid. I seek him out, and say, ""I'd like to speak with you.""

We go to another part of the gym, and I tell him it was suoer unacceptable to do that, when I'm taking care of my kid. I get angry, saying he was acting like a jackass, when there was no need,

""I just said it politely, don't film my kids"".

""It was not polite, fucking be real, man.""

He continues to hem and haw, and I say, ""Did you really think the best time to do that was when I'm taking care of my kid, who's career is over now. Is that really the right time?""

And he says, with absolutely no emotion, ""Yeah, well, maybe it wasn't the right time?""

""You fucking think?"" I walk off, knowing I was going to go nowhere in this.

c11rq3	2019-06-15 20:30:56	Training_Candy	AITA for being upset and reacting rudely for the way I was told that my dog died?	"Quick background info:

Thirteen years ago my family adopted Sierra when she was about 6 months old. I was nine. In short, she was the most amazing dog you could ever wish for and was adored by absolutely everyone who met her. My family worshipped her and gave her an amazing life. 

Fast forward to the present: I have moved abroad (to Central Europe from Oregon) and keep in  consistent contact with my family, often via a group chat. Anyways, yesterday I was at work and things were slow and so I checked my phone. I open the group chat and see a message from a relative commenting how sorry she was that Sierra passed away. I was FLOORED. I had had no idea.

I scrolled up about 10 messages and saw a message from my mom (to the group chat) stating that our doggo had gotten very sick and the vet advised that she be put to sleep. There were some pretty graphic descriptions of how sick she had gotten. I hadn't been told that she was sick.

Most of the other messages were about how they are waiting to break the news to my 5yo cousin. 

Honestly, alongside the immense sadness I felt hurt and a little angry at the way I found out. Later in the day I texted my mom privately asking if they had told the 5yo cousin, and she responded with lengthy text about why they don't want to break it to the 5yo until his mom returns from a business trip (which I think is absolutely the right way to handle things with a kid that age). My emotions boiled over and I responded sarcastically ""I was thrilled to find out in the group chat."" 

I know that was a shitty thing to say. But it turned into a huge argument that ended with my mom telling me that the other relatives (who only saw Sierra at holidays maybe a few times a year) were just as close the dog. 

Well, no. I grew up with that dog, she was one of the only constants in my somewhat tumultuous upbringing.  

I'm hurt that I found out so indirectly and that the importance of Sierra in my life wasn't considered, and that no one asked how I was doing. I shouldn't have responded with sarcasm, but the way I was told has added to the intense sadness I am feeling.

c11r47	2019-06-15 20:29:15		AITA for making fun of a schizophrenic man?	"My 2 children and I went out for breakfast. We chose sidewalk cafe which was packed. We found 1 empty table but with only two chairs so I scanned the other tables and spotted a man dining alone at a table with 2 chairs. He was reading so I gingerly approached and kinda whispered, ""Excuse me, if you're not using this chair may I?"" When he looked up I was struck by how handsome he was, and with such a warm smile. 

""Sure!"" He exclaimed, ""I'm not using it.""

&#x200B;

I'm pretty socially awkward, always have been. When I get into situations with intense eye contact and pheromones, I start getting that 7th grade feeling all over again, which usually results in some pretty un-smooth behavior. So after giving me his chair I could have said 'thanks!' and walked away, instead I said, ""Well I had to ask; for all I know your imaginary bff coulda been sitting there, didn't want to be rude."" Immediately upon saying this I cringed at how dumb and unfunny it sounded, but without missing a beat he quipped back, ""Nah, the Zyprexa has taken care of those pesky imaginary friends"". He said it with almost a wink. I didn't get it, but he said it in charming way so I giggled. Having worked in an impatient psychiatric facility many years back, I recognized the name 'Zyprexa' as a pharmaceutical but didn't remember what it was used to treat.

&#x200B;

The littles and I enjoyed our meals and as we went to leave I thought I'd do the polite thing and return the chair. This time he was on the phone so I gently set the chair back in it's place and mouthed ""Thank you"" and gave a thumbs up. I walked about 20 ft. to the corner where my little ones were waiting when I heard his voice behind me, ""You know, 2019 is a little late to be this tone deaf when it comes to mental health."" Confused I looked back to see that he was in fact looking right at me. We locked gazes for a second before my son pulled on my hand and said, ""It's green!"", which brought me back to the task at hand: crossing the street. So I faced forward and put my hands on my children's shoulders (as I always do) before looking both ways and stepping down from the curb. A few steps later I hear the man behind me shout, ""Yeah, that's right, quick get the young innocents away from the wild crazy man!!""

&#x200B;

I looked back again and this time I swear the folks on either side of this man's table were now staring me down too, like I was just some giant dick, hopping away on my balls-for-feet.

We got back the car and I left pretty quickly, but ten minutes later while stopped at a gas station I Googled 'Zyprexa' and learned, much to my horror, that it was an antipsychotic commonly prescribed to people with schizophrenia. Meaning:

&#x200B;

I made a joke about hanging out with imaginary friends..to a schizophrenic man.

I appreciate everyone's input and apologize if my post came off as homophobic.
I didn't forbid her from going, She asked, and I told her I didn't feel it was the appropriate environment for a 15 year old and told her maybe next year. She respected our(Mom & Dad) decision.

Edit:#2 Survey says... I'm the asshole. But, I can live with that.
I'm only looking out for her safety and best interest at heart. I get I'm the asshole for not letting her go, but I'm still not convinced it's a place for a 15 year old to be. Thanks to all that have responded, it's been a wild topic to discuss.

c11pts	2019-06-15 20:25:51	Jacobg303	AITA For not pitching on my mothers birthday present?	"Title sounds rough, let me explain.

Nobody in my family has ever had much money. Very paycheck to paycheck. My mom recently got a new car and has wanted to install a remote start. One of my sisters in the last year has become engaged to a guy who is very well off. She is in a position now where money isn't a concern and that attitude has become a new thing with her in the past several months. I live alone, don't make shit money, but not much of anything left on the bone after bills/ groceries etc. My sister decided to purchase this remote start and set up the installation etc. for my moms birthday. She gives me a call asking for me to pitch on half of it (around $200). I kind of laugh at her and tell her that would take me close to 1.5 months to save up and that I hadn't planned on going in on the remote start in the first place. She makes a fuss about it and I (in lesser words) tell her that when I get myself a sugar mama I can pay for an extravagant birthday gift for mom next year. So tomorrow, as I have for the last 5 years, will be taking my  mom to lunch and buying her some flowers for her birthday. As well as probably a 6 pack for my sister to ""apologize"""	No A-holes here	0	0

c11mz6	2019-06-15 20:18:17	aita-babysitter	WIBTA for refusing to babysit after an unfavourable experience?	"A little background, I'm a 17 year old (girl) student, who has been babysitting for the last two years. I volunteered in a daycare for two years, so I have basic childcare experience.

In January, a mother got in touch and asked if I'd be interested in babysitting her daughter ""Lucy"". I said yes, and she said she'd be in touch. Last week Tuesday, the mother asks if I can babysit on the Thursday, I say yes and agree to be there for 8pm. She assures me that the Lucy will be asleep by then.

Thursday morning, the mother lets me know that Lucy isn't feeling well, and she gives me the opportunity to back out. I tell her that it's no problem, I've looked after sick children in the past, and she'll hopefully be asleep anyway.

I arrive at 8, and the mother leaves. They live in a flat, neighbours on each side, with Lucy's bedroom wall being the other side of a neighbour's wall. When I check on her, she sits up, sees me, and starts screaming for her mother. I try to calm her, explaining that I'm here to look after her, and that her mother is out.

Around two minutes later, she calms down, and falls asleep again. I don't contact her mother, as the situation has been resolved, and I'll tell her when she returns. However after she's gone back to sleep, there is a knock on the door. I was told that if I feel comfortable answering the door, then I can. So I do. 

At the door is ""Arthur"", who says he is the next door neighbour. He politely asks who I am, and I tell him I'm the babysitter. He voices his concerns about Lucy's screams, and I assure him that everything is fine and that she's just ill. He asks to come in and check on her, and I refuse, telling him that he is a stranger to me and so I wouldn't be comfortable. This is when he begins to get louder and more forceful, saying he thinks I've hurt Lucy. Before I close the door, he says that he is going to call the police, and report me.

I phone Lucy's mother, explaining the situation, and she says not to worry, that Arthur is all bark and no bite. I'm still shaken, but I say okay and leave her to her night. 

A little while later, there is another knock on the door. I look through the peephole, and it's a woman. She must've heard me approach, because she begins talking. She says she's Arthur's wife, and that they're worried about Lucy. She urges me to open the door, and begins banging on it, saying that if I don't let her in she'll call the police, calling me a child abuser. I, obviously, don't let her in, and she leaves after a while.

Lucy's mother gets home, and apologises for everything. I'm still shaken, but I accept the apology. She pays me £5 extra, and says that she didn't tell Lucy I'd be babysitting, which is probably why she was so distressed.

Skip to today, Lucy's mother contacts me asking if I can babysit in a few weeks. I haven't responded yet. So WIBTA if I refused because of what happened? I know it wasn't her fault, but I can't help feeling uncomfortable over what happened.

Edit: I've decided not to babysit Lucy again. Her mother was a little annoyed, (""How am I going to find another babysitter before then?"") but she did seem to understand why I didn't feel comfortable. She said that she would talk with the neighbours to ensure nothing like that would happen again.

I've officially learned my lesson, don't open the door when you're babysitting. Thanks everyone for their help. Good to know I'm officially NTA!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Well I have always hated chocolate, literally any type of chocolate I won't touch, it grosses me out. I'm pregnant now and it's made me hate chocolate even more, I really can't bring myself to eat it.


For some reason they decided to get a chocolate cake with chocolate fudge frosting. When they tried to give me a piece I told them I don't eat chocolate. They said since it was my birthday and they got it for me that I had to have a piece, and I refused and reminded them I've always hated chocolate. It turned into an argument with us going back and forth with them telling me I had to have some and that just one piece won't kill me, and me refusing and saying I hate chocolate and can't bring myself to eat anything chocolate that even the thought of it makes me sick. Finally I just said if they're going to make this much of a fuss over it I'm just going to leave, and went home. Now they said I ruined the party and i was ungrateful and rude for not eating just a piece of it and for leaving like that. My whole family is pissed off at me now. AITA for not eating a piece?"

I had a piece in the school gallary, and the college was giving out cash prizes. I won nothing this time, and I was kind of surprized to be honest given how popular it was.

Well, after the event I was told by my drawing teacher that I actually did win a prize from a women's art alliance but they forgot to print out the letter and thus never gave it to me.

c11iw7	2019-06-15 20:07:20	HeadVideo	AITA for letting a mother pick her child up without contacting the father?	"I work at a day care and am responsible for pickups. One girl's father usually picks her up, but last week her mother came. I hadn't met her personally, but I checked her ID and her daughter recognized her and called her ""mommy"" so I let her go with her, which is our normal procedure. I have a list of kids who are on the ""only one specific parent can pick this kid up"" list and she wasn't on it.

A little while later, the father shows up to pick up his daughter. I was doing another pickup so he dealt with my boss, but as I understand it, my boss freaked out and said that the girl's mother had picked her up and offered to call the cops, but the father laughed it off as a miscommunication between the two of them and left. Nothing else came of it and the girl was back this week with no parent complaints or anything.

My boss is furious with me however and told me that I should have called the father when the mother came to pick the daughter up because that was different from what normally happens. I think he is overreacting because the girl was not on the list of kids to double check, and there weren't any custody issues and it was just a miscommunication. He thinks I was wrong because the daughter could have potentially been kidnapped, but I don't think I did anything wrong. I'll follow his new instructions to call the parent who normally does pickup if the other shows up, and probably will annoy some parents in the process, but AITA for not calling the father when the girl's mother showed up?"

c11ig8	2019-06-15 20:06:06	saberloli	WIBTA if I make disconnect our phone at night?	"My grandma sleeps in the ground floor of our house alone because their room was the only room located there, save for the help's room. Since my grandpa died, she only had the help's company at night (and our dog) but since the help was gone too, I sleep nearby her room to keep her company. She wakes up even with the slightest noise, but she can probably sleep again immediately if it wasn't for too long.

  


Here's the annoying part. My uncle likes to come home at ungodly hours (2am to 3am) and would ring our home phone (which sounded a lot like the old Messenger app's tone) and alert the whole house and wake up our dog that starts barking like hell. For years I had been sleeping upstairs and he actually wakes up my grandma to open our gate for him, and it wasnt till this year that I started rushing to the phone as soon as it rings just so he'll stop calling to avoid waking up my grandma.

  


The disaster that happened tonight was when my uncle called, I had just gotten inside the comfort room, still, I ran as fast as I can to the phone. Too late, dog was barking enough to wake up the whole neighborhood and my grandma was already ready to pick up the phone. To make matters worse, I had just finished my work and instead of getting mad at her favorite son, I got reprimanded for staying up late (regardless of reason).

  


And so, I'm planning to start disconnecting our phone at night. I'm not sure how to phrase it in English, but I'll let the phone hang off (not necessarily cut the phone line). Yes, I know that I'm exposing my uncle to danger at 3am. But I also think he should start respecting everyone else's time and rest. I'm still wondering why can't we just have duplicate keys for the lock, but I also understand that it would be hard to actually reach and unlock the gate from the outside.

  


Some more context: my grandma is a huge pushover when it comes to my uncle. He's 32, definitely a grown ass man but not acting like it. I has already asked him to message me first before calling. Numerous times. I'd like to say my grandmother tells him off but she is such an enabler I and he's gotten way too spoiled by her.

  


Tldr: Uncle keeps coming home at 2-3am, wakes everyone up with his obnoxious family phone calls including our grandmother just for his arrival.

I interviewed for and got offered a position for a construction company, just to be their receptionist. My new potential boss seems really nice, I like him a lot. But he said a few times they want someone who knew they would stay within the company for a long time. And that this position should be seen as at least a 2 year commitment, not a temporary thing. I never actually straight up agreed to that just kind of nodded and moved on.

But anyway, I plan to move to california when I have enough money saved up, which shouldn’t take more than 6 months but who’s to say - it could be more or less than that. I’ve asked my mom and a few others for advice and they all said the same thing. That it’s not a big deal since I don’t have a set date, that all companies say that in interviews, and that I should take it and save up money.

c11g3s	2019-06-15 20:00:03		AITA for not wanting to meet my dad's new family, go to his wedding with his new wife, or basically be involved in his life at all?	"I am in my mid 20s, I am disabled (crippled from cancer), my dad provided for me through college (helped pay for my college); he was never one of those ""when you turn 18, you're on your own, get out of my house"" types of parent, and I was always and still am grateful for him providing for our family... I am especially grateful relative to my siblings because I had my cancer was when I was very young in the early 90s and most of the treatment was still considered experimental/not covered by insurance then, so he was forced to pay out of pocket for a lot of my treatment and was literally bankrupted by it... I will forever be grateful for that.

But we have never been particularly close, especially as I got older.  When I was a kid, he worked odd hours, such that he would sleep most of the day and work at night... When I was a teen he worked multiple jobs almost every single day of the week (several different fire departments at once), so he would do like a 24 hour shift at one department, then a 24 hour shift at the next, and a 24 hour shift at the next, etc., he would only be home like one day a week and he would sleep most of that day.  I rarely saw/interacted with him.

During that time he cheated on my mom with someone he worked with, but they didn't get divorced, presumably because he didn't want to pay a lot of alimony and my mom didn't want the headache.  Fast forward a few years and he changed careers; he worked outside of the country on a one month on one month off kind of schedule.  He also bought another house and lived there whenever he was back in the country rather than at our house.  I was in college at that time, I saw him maybe a half dozen times over the four years I was at school; I have seen him maybe once or twice a year since then.

A bit over a year ago he told my mom he wanted a divorce... They finally got divorced and shortly thereafter he told us he was getting married to someone else, who he was presumably seeing for quite a while before the divorce.  Since then he has asked me to come visit many times, asked me if I wanted to meet his new wife and her daughter, asked me if I wanted to go to his wedding, etc., etc... I decline every time, I have absolutely no interest in interacting with his new family or even him really at all.  I don't hate him or anything, its just as I said before, we never had much of a relationship to begin with and only grew more distant as I got older, such that I just genuinely don't care to be a part of his new life.

The most recent time I spoke with him he went on a tirade about how ungrateful all of us are (my siblings are equally uninterested in participating in his new life), how none of us ever loved him, and just wanted money from him and what not.

So here's the story, me and the girlfriend have been going out for about 6 months and had an end of year plan to move in together (note the end of year which also gives me time to pay off debts at save some money) that was untill a few days ago when I was informed that she had found the perfect house and was going to view it while I was at work, when I said I didn't want to sign a contract to rent until I saw the place first I was met with an argument that I should trust her and if she likes it I will like it too, while I do like it I am cautious of signing a contract for a large part of my paycheck for a place I haven't seen as the next time there is an appointment for viewing that I am not at work is next weekend and it ""will be gone by then"". While I have seen photos it is hard for me to get a sense of the place and if I like it until I actually see it. She viewed the place yesterday and thinks it's perfect (she thought that before seeing it and took 9 photos for me but I find it hard to get excited about a place from just some photos). I feel as if I have no choice in the matter but to sign the contract or have her pissed off with me. Am I the ass hole for wanting to see the place with my own eyes before signing a contract?."

c11fgr	2019-06-15 19:58:18		AITA for flipping out at my greatgrandma, given the circumstances?	"I had no idea how to word this title.

I’d also like to state that I don’t think I’m TA, but have so many weird situations like this with my family that I ended up feeling guilty, anyways.

Pull it back 4 years to my junior year of high school. I’m with my cousin and her mom at a mall in the city shopping for my prom dress. In all actuality I don’t know why we were shopping, anyways, as my family’s poor as all hell and there’s no way we could’ve afforded the dresses that were upwards of 400-500$. Maybe it was just nice to dress up like that for awhile. Anyways, not the point of the story. I find some dresses I really like, and we send pictures to my family — mainly my mom, grandma, and greatgrandma, the last of whom had a huge hand in raising me because my mom sucks. Greatgrandma is... A lovely woman, but she’s very hypercritical and has always had the knack for making me feel bad about myself. Nobody said anything about the pictures and cousin’s mom wanted to go shopping around the mall for awhile, so cousin and I decide we’d walk around separately, too.

So we’re shopping and walking, and all of a sudden we see stores start shutting down. Super weird, as it’s not anything close to close. Cousin and I just pass Victoria’s Secret when she gets a text from her mom — there was someone with a gun in the other side of the mall, and shots had been fired. I immediately grab cousin’s arm and pull her into VS, the only store open. We see some cops with huge ass guns coming our way. VS people had no clue what was going on, somehow, but I made my way to the counter and told them the situation. We ended up cramming everyone into the backroom for two hours and waiting for the situation to resolve. When it did cousin, cousin’s mom and I all met up again and drove home. I’m... Easily shaken, as I live with severe anxiety, and started crying the minute we started driving. I called greatgrandma hoping to just talk to her and settle my nerves. I told her everything that had happened. She was very nonchalant about all of it, and her response, finally? “You looked fat in that last dress you sent me”.

I was shocked. Prom wasn’t even on my mind, or the stupid dress, and she calls me fat after I just spent hours thinking I was going to get killed? I was so livid I hung up on her. The next time I saw her, we got into a huge fight because I asked her how she thought that was appropriate. She told me I was overreacting, and holds it over my head to this day. So, Reddit — I’ve decided to consult you! This is not the first nor the last time something like this has happened with my family, and I’ve been thinking of sharing the other one I have stocked up, but it’s a long one so I figured I’d knock this one out of the way. Was I really just being a big baby? Or was she TA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c11f9d	2019-06-15 19:57:45	axanette	WIBTA if I chose to go to a concert over dogsitting for my parents?	"My parents have asked me to dogsit while they're on holiday abroad next month. Part of this involves staying at their house for that period as I live in a flat and my mum says the stairs will be too difficult for one of the dogs to handle as he is older and has joint problems.

Because of this, I will have to take seven days off work as their house is in the next town over and I can't drive so won't be able to get to the office. Due to having already taken a number of vacation days this year and already booking time off for Christmas, I only have four left. When I've told them this, they've just said it's fine and ""we'll work something out.""

However, one of my favourite singers has announced a tour later this year including a date on Halloween that I am dying to go to. I've never seen her live and this is the first time I've not had schoolwork and exams preventing me from going. Due to how long it will take me to travel there though, I'll need to take two days off work.

I texted my mum about this and got no reply so I don't think she's too happy. I *really* want to go--holidays aren't really my thing and I prefer going to gigs instead so this is essentially my vacation.

My parents' argument for me dogsitting is that I'm someone the dogs know so they won't get separation anxiety (the younger one is particularly prone to this). The older dog is also on a number of medications that require certain dosages at different times and they don't trust a kennel to make sure he is given them correctly.

My argument is that for starters I don't have the full amount of vacation days to dogsit anyway. I'm also not happy as my mum mentioned a few months back that I would be invited on this holiday as long as I paid for myself, which I agreed to. They then booked it behind my back and didn't tell me until they asked me to watch the dogs. While they partly want me because of the medication issue, they've also said I'm the ""cheaper option."" I won't be getting paid for this, as my payment will be ""food and lodgings."" I'm also concerned given the older dog's medical issues--as I can't drive, if he takes a turn I won't be able to get him to the vet. 

Plus, I just really don't want to give up all the vacation days I have left to be alone in their house in a town I'm unfamiliar with.

I'm not the only option they have; I have an uncle who has previously has a dog with severe health issues so he'd be more familiar with medications and dosages than I am. My parents are reluctant to ask him, however, as they believe I am more mature and responsible.

c11eki	2019-06-15 19:55:59		AITA for being upset about walking in on my SO being with another woman in our bed even though we’re in an open relationship?	"For a little background, my SO and I are in an open relationship that have some rules. 

Since we started dating while we were young, we decided that even though we love each other and only want each other romantically, sexually we like to explore. And normally it’s not an issue at all, especially since he’s the only one that goes with other people. We don’t have jealousy issues. 

One of the rules of ours is that I don’t want to see him with another woman. It’s fine that he is with one, I just don’t want to see it. We have a few other rules but it’s unimportant. 

A few days ago, my SO was going to visit his parents that are a little far away, and I knew I was going to be home alone coming back from work. 

My SO has been sick with the cold, and even though I tried my best, I ended up getting sick too. At work, I found that I had a fever that was slowly climbing and decided I needed to go home early that day. 

I get home early, excited to get into my bed, when I walk in the door to see his shoes and another pair of shoes I haven’t seen before. At first I was curious but I didn’t care cause I was sick and went to my bedroom. 

I open the door to the room and see the both of them on the bed, and both of them shocked to see me. I close the door and walk away to the living room. 

She quickly left, and my SO came out apologizing right away. I was so in shock and upset, that I just wanted him to leave, so he left. 

He apologized to me via text message, and the other woman apologized to me too. Even with the apologizes, I still feel hurt. 

Today, he came back from his parent’s house upset that I’m still upset. He says that he doesn’t understand why I’m so upset even though I did explain why. 

I feel it’s disrespectful for him to bring a woman into the same bed that I paid for, and that my SO and I sleep in together. I’m very upset that he did this in the room we live in together. He said he wasn’t thinking about how I would feel walking in on the scene.

"I have lived with my brother for the last 5 years.  3 years ago, the family dog passed away after a long life of 17 years.  My brother wanting to replace the dog, brought in a stray that his boss found about two months after of dog had passed.  
Outside of getting in the trash, he was a decent dog so my family kept him.  Fast forward 15 months, and my brothers wife convinces my brother to get a cat, despite the fact that he is severely allergic.  After the cat arrives, the dog begins showing signs that he isnt happy and wants attention.  
I left the country for school for a little over two months, and while I was away, he began chewing up things such as glasses, inhalers, small items that aren't worth a lot of money.  
My brother wanted to get rid of the dog immediately.  After I returned I said lets do a better job of taking care of him.  My brother furious, asked if I would claim financial responsibility for the dog, meaning buy food and vet appointments.  I said if we were keeping the dog, not a problem.  
One week later, while my sister-in-law is laying down in her room the dog chews a hole in their bed mattress.  My brother is rightfully pissed and says hes getting rid of him.  I don't stand in his way, but ask if he will please take the dog to a non kill shelter.  He tries, but all shelters are full of animals right now because of the floods in Missouri.  Not to mention, he is told to take him to a non kill shelter means the dog needs vaccinations so he wants me to cover the costs.  I told him it wasnt my problem since they are getting rid of the dog and not keeping it.  If he has to get the dog vaccinated to get rid of it, he is going to pay for it, not me.  
Fast forward one more week, the dog once again goes to town on the same mattress.  My sister-in-law runs around the house beating him.  After cornering him to beat him more, the dog snips at her hand and draws a little blood from a scratch.  Ive seen more blood from a paper cut.  
The next day my brother is practically giddy with excitement, as now he can turn the dog over and claim he is a biter.  Two days after he turned him over, I went to the humane society to tell my story about the dog to clear my conscience and to see and walk the dog. I found out he was euthanized because he was labeled as a biter and would not be able to be adopted.

c11dks	2019-06-15 19:53:14		AITA for avoiding a “friend” to the point where I don’t even open the door when he comes?	Ok so this sounds extremely bad but here some context. This guy and I have known each other for years. We’ve been friends since we were 4 and now we’re 18. We’ve always done fun things together like go to amusement parks and have sleepovers with other friends playing video games and eating junk food. We even went on a cruise together once with some other close friends. However, around 2017 he started becoming different. I was in a program at my school called IB (was because I’ve graduated) and it’s really rigorous. We started at the same time but he quit halfway through our freshman year because he couldn’t handle it (he was getting bad grades and kept falling behind). So his mom took him out and put him in some private school. This private school is terrible though because it’s known for housing drugs and kids illegally drinking and having sex. So he went there and I continued with IB making more friends and some close new friends that I’ll keep in contact with for the rest of of life. Ever since he started going to that’s chop, he’s changed completely and become kind of an asshole. Every time we hung out he’d try to force me to take drugs with him and he showed me a hidden stash of alcohol he had in his house when I came over. Every time we talked about something, he’d turn it into a discussion about having sex and talking inappropriately about girls and what he wanted to do to them. We started growing apart since then and I’ve been trying to avoid him because every time I hang out with him it’s the same crap over and over and he tries to get me to do stuff that I don’t want to do like take drugs and drink underage. I ceased contact with him in 2017 but he lives in my neighborhood so he always comes to my house knocking on my door and yelling for me to come out but I just tell my family not to open it. He stopped coming in 2018 but he’s started it again and keeps trying to hang with me but I constantly just avoid him. He tries to ask me on Snapchat and Instagram but I ignore his messages. I feel pretty bad but I know if I hang out with him he’s just going to try to convince me to the same illegal stuff again because that’s what happens every time. So AITA for avoiding him and not responding to his messages?		1	0

So my friends name is Mary... so when we went to the first store i told her i'd be right back and i snuck over to the customer service saying ""hey i'm with my friend she doesn't have her phone can you ring her over the intercome?"" They said yes and asked for her name i told them  "" her name is mary jane""(get the reference? lol) they said ""Mary Jane please come to the front register"" i ran off laughing to her she was laughing and thought that time was funny. So was i TA even if she was fine with it that time? About an hour later after we ate lunch she wanted to go to another store but she had to use the bathroom so she told me just to sit and wait... i snuck off and ran to the customer service of this store too. I told them the same story "" i lost my friend can you ring her over the intercom "" they said ""Mary Jane come to the front your friend is waiting for you ."" I didn't see her she came back and cussed me out for not waiting for her  by the bathroom, first off i can't go in with her, 2nd she was in there for like 10 mins and i left to go walk around and decided to do the prank again. She is 3 years older than me so i dunno if that's why she got so mad, was i or she TA in the situation?

She got a boyfriend not long ago and like SO’s do, he was around all the time.  Which is fine, he’s a great guy and fun to be around.  Problem started when he began complaining about little things here and there.  Like the fridge needing to be more organized or how they need more room in the pantry.  Okay cool, whatever, he was going to move in so they needed more room.  
So I made a comment about how FH and I always did the dishes.  Roommate responds “we don’t make that many dishes” referring to her and her boyfriend.  

FH and I were leaving overnight so we did the dishes and left.  Came back to a full sink.  I was annoyed.  I told FH to stop doing any dishes they make and just do ours if she felt she didn’t make that many.  So we stopped.  Sink is still full.  On top of that her family comes over every day and dirties as least one or two dishes a day.  
We are trying to clean house today and I text the house message “can you please do your dishes today since we are trying to clean up”.  She ignores it and is rushing around trying to pack to leave for the weekend.  Finally I text her boyfriend to please ask her to help do the dishes and he flys off saying how I must be against her having a healthy relationship with her family and how I’m “getting worked up over a few dishes”. I get a message from her saying she’s not gonna deal with it and I’m being “fucking neurotic” and how me and FH and i wait forever to do our dishes too (which is sometimes true, but again, we both work full time so we don’t alway have the ability to keep ourselves sorted 100% of the time) 
So AITA for getting upset and asking her to clean up?  link to sink pic

c118tr	2019-06-15 19:40:43	softheart7	AITA for not wanting to remain friends with someone(24F) who cheats on their bf(23M)?	"I'm new to reddit so please be patient and let me know if I've made a mistake. 

I(23F) met said friend(24F) at student halls 1.5 years ago. Said friend has moved into a studio flat with her bf(23M) last year. They have been together for 8 years.

They have relationship problems where it sounds like he neglects her. She has told me about many instances when she has cheated on him - from sexting to going on dates with work colleagues to finally breaking up with him for a day, having a day of sex with work colleague and then going back to exbf. They are still together now. 

I never felt comfortable saying how I felt about her cheating - I just never thought she would take it well so I just tried ignoring it. But when she hid from her ex that she had sex with someone else and just got back together with him, I just had had enough. (Bf doesn't know about anything other than that she gave one guy her number). 

I've lost a lot of respect for her. We had a text conversation where I told her I no longer felt comfortable with her and wanted to stop being friends. I asked if we could call/videochat/skype to talk about it. Friend said she has anxiety with those methods. I said that I have anxiety whenever it's messaging. I said that since neither of us can talk, I just want to stop being friends and just leave it. She continued messaging and told me that I was being unfair for not giving her a reason and that I was being a bad friend. I just blocked her on everything. 

Now a mutual friend(25F) has got in touch and is trying to convince me to rethink my decision. Mutual friend thinks I'm overreacting and will regret this. I don't know what friend(24F) has said to her but mutual friend mentioned how I may have created this evil version of friend in my head. 

All of us (excluding bf) have mental health difficulties. Friend has recently been fired and is unemployed. 

Tl;dr Friend of 1.5yrs has been cheating on bf of 8yrs for the last year. I've never told her how I felt about the cheating but told her that I wanted to stop being friends with her. She tried to push for a reason but because of anxiety, I ended up blocking her. Mutual friend is now trying to convince me to remain friends. AITA for not wanting to be friends with her? AITA for not explaining why I stopped being friends with her?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I realize it's Summer vacation for kids, so I go to the pool when it opens in the mornings, at 9, because i like to swim and read by the pool in peace. There's a rule about unsupervised kids under 12 (still seems young to me, but what do I know). Lately there have been several kids already there when I when I arrive, unsupervised and not looking 12 to me, though one of them I think could be, in all fairness, usually 3-4 of them plus a toddler. They're loud and not careful, and I know about things they get up to because they're openly discussing hooking up with people and doing dabs right in front of me. Honestly don't care about what mischief they get into, but they get on my nerves and also jyst plan worry me, especially swimming with a toddler unsupervised.

&#x200B;

I work for a firm that renders professional services (Auditing, Consultation, Tax) etc. This firm belongs to a group of firms called ""The Big 4"" as they are perceived to be the pinnacle of the industry. 

&#x200B;

About 6 months ago an acquaintance of mine who works for another firm  in the big 4 was terminated for leaking classified information. His firm acknowledged that he did it by accident (He's very active on social media and unknowingly put up on his instagram story his wrist watch and on the table the front page of some sensitive documents were shown) and decided to part ways with him no hard feelings. Afterwards, he applied to another member of the big 4 and they turned him down during the application process. 

&#x200B;

After these rejections he decided to take to social media and go off about how awful and archaic companies like this are and how badly they treat and compensate their employees and generally telling young graduates to steer clear of these ""predatory"" companies. In private he later messages me that he would like to  try applying to my place as he's heard it can be different from the others. I told him to look online \*bla, blah, bla\*. 

&#x200B;

Now, this individual in question isn't the kind of person I would like to accidentally end up being partnered with on a project so ... I screenshotted all of his rants, put them together and sent them to my HR. 

&#x200B;

My objective was only to inform them that such a person may slip through our ranks as my firm  strongly recommends we help filter out such people. I was wrong HR replied me saying she's glad I forwarded this to her and she plans on relaying it to her counterparts throughout the industry saying people like my acquaintance only make life harder for everyone around them. 

&#x200B;

This was all about 6 months ago. Fast forward to now and my acquaintance is genuinely having a hard time finding a job in our industry. With the credentials he has this really shouldn't be an issue and i can't help but feel that this is all my fault."	Not the A-hole	0	0

There was a woman on her phone multiple times [30 mins in, then 20 later, 10 later]. Her screen is bright enough to distract everyone in her row.

During the 3rd time, she shows her phone to her husband that the screen is doing something weird [not scrolling notifications with her touch]. So I said out loud, ""PUT YPUR FUCKING *eye contact* phone away!"" She is 2 seats away from me and my girlfriend [in the middle of this] hears her say ""wHaTtHeFuCK?!"" For the last 35 minutes of the movie nothing happens.

Then after the movie, my girlfriend and I exit the opposite way, away from their seats. The husband shouts out to me at the doorway of the screening room [my girlfriend and I are already in the hallway]. 

""Hey bro I didn't like how you treated my lady!"" I said ""well too bad, fuck you and fuck her!"" As people are exiting past him, I'm between the screening room and the ticket ripper podium. I'm getting heated, this guy is shorter than my girlfriend. I put my drink and candy on the floor and stand up straight and say ""you wanna do something? Get out of the doorway and get in front of the cameras!"" Security suit says take it outside. Then I say ""maybe if your stupid ass customers wouldn't pull the phones out in the middle of a movie I wouldn't have to tell them."" Husband chickened out and went back in the theatre.

They never apologIze and just avoid me or continue their problematic behavior after instead of addressing the issues. My husband never says anything he has literally watched them yell at me at times, or witnessed them saying really nasty things to me and just stands there.

Today I found out in addition to this dynamic one of them texted my husband something about our house and dogs I should have known too and specifically said they weren’t going to talk to me about it and not to tell me.

he didn’t tell me either for weeks he just kept it to himself until he slipped up today and mentioned the thing the roommate said and when I said “what I didn’t know about that” he immediately was like shot I wasn’t supposed to tell you.

c114br	2019-06-15 19:29:03	yaradahl	AITA for talking about DNA tests in front of adopted cousins?	"Ok, so I was reading another post on here (the one where OP wanted to take a photo without the adopted kids), and it got me thinking about something that happened around christmas time.

I was working over the summer, and earned a bit of extra money for University and whatever else, and with that money I bought a DNA test (from 23andme), as I find genetics really interesting and wanted to know more.

I was talking about it at a family gathering at Christmas (after I send in the test, before I got results), where my mothers’ many siblings and all their kids were present (I have around 20 cousins on that side of the family). I found out one of my cousins (not present on the day, but her brothers were) was getting a similar DNA test as a gift, and this got me even more excited because, as I explained, we’d soon be able to see how much DNA we shared! I think I then explained to my mother and some of my aunts/uncles/cousins (can’t remember exactly who was present at the time) how related family members would be able to see how much DNA they shared with each other and connect with family members.

It was around this point my aunt chimed in that my cousins (her two adopted children) wouldn’t show up. It kind of threw me out of it, because obviously she was right but I didn’t think I’d said anything wrong - and yet, I thought she said it in a slightly angry tone. I didn’t say anything at the time, and I can’t quite remember what I said in response, but it stayed with me. Was I wrong to talk about this in front of her and her kids (who were present on the day, but not necessarily both in the living room at the time; they obviously know they are adopted)? I didn’t think so at the time, obviously they are as much my cousins as any of my biologically related cousins, but that doesn’t change the fact that we do not share DNA in the same way...

So this happened last August or so. My current boyfriend were seeing each other but not official yet (I asked him to be my BF officially about a week later). We were not in the same city at the time this happened.

I went to a frat party with some friends and it was pretty fun. During the party this guy came up to me and started talking to me. He was pretty nice, and I thought he was being friendly. I didn’t want to assume he was hitting on me, because I’ve seen lots of people do that, so I didn’t want to be one of Those People.

He told me about salsa dancing and showed me a couple moves (we were standing far from each other, super chill, not very flirty at all IMO). I gave him my number so he could tell me more about the class.

I’m pretty oblivious and blind when people are flirting with me (I generally give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they’re being nice/friendly) and my boyfriend has commented on this often (we joke that I didn’t even know he was into me when we started dating even though we met on a dating app)

He asked me if he could kiss me, and I said no, but I never told him explicitly about my current BF. Eventually, he left. 

I haven’t told my current BF about this. I didn’t tell him then because I didn’t know how he would react at the time to other guys hitting on me. New relationship and all. I love my BF and would never cheat on him, but idk if I should tell him about this now bc it happened a long time ago and it didn’t matter to me at all. AITA and should I tell him?"		1	0

They bench was put very close to the cable machine and I was doing them all back to back, with a minute and a half rest in between each superset. Some guy came to take the straight bar and by the time I noticed he had already taken it off the clips  I told him that although he is more than welcome to work in, he can’t take the bar because I had two of these left to do. He disregarded my offer, left the straight bar on the floor unclipped, and walked away. 

Now I pay just as much as he does to workout and use the gym equipment, and wasn’t one of the gym goers who chit chat or is on their phone. I got peeved and quickly did two sets with the straight bar and gave it to him. I’m conflicted if maybe doing three workouts in a super set was not proper gym etiquette. AITA?

So basically what happened was I was making a right turn on a green light and just as I was about to turn some guy forms speeding down the road and nearly crashed into the drivers side of my car. I’m guessing he was running a red light as the signal on my side had just turned green and the signal on his side must’ve just turned red and he was trying to speed through it. Anyways he was going at least 60 mph in a 45 mph zone and would’ve completely wrecked my car and caused a massive accident had I not stopped in time. My sister was in the car with me and I’m pretty sure we both would’ve ended up with broken bodies had I not seen the guy. I was pissed so I made the turn and followed the guy for about a minute just honking repeatedly at him before I changed lanes and made a U-turn. As I passed him (he slowed down because there was another car in front) I flicked him off. I was really angry because this idiot nearly killed me and my sister and I was acting in the moment.

later on i was telling my husband about how rude and unprofessional the medical receptionist was. he agreed, but he also mentioned that i should have just minded my own business. i asked why, and he said that even though the woman most likely knew that i had heard the receptionist, i probably embarrassed her even more by announcing it. i hadn't thought about that. then again, if i hadn't said something, how much more of their conversation would i have heard?

My girlfriend and I were together for a year before moving together, so everyone who knows us, knows that we've been serious for quite some time. Friends on both sides want to visit and we've been excited to host in a fun place and enjoy the city together.
 

Let's call my old pal Stinky. Stinky visited the first year we moved here, and was one of the two close friends I had back home who was actually able to make it. Everything was fine and now discussions about ol' Stinky making this an annual pilgrimage have begun.




No idea what preempted Stinky to say it, but during a conversation where I tried to accommodate his bachelorhood, he decided to say, ""I'm going to drop a bomb: I would fuck the shit out of your girlfriend. But...""

I immediately dropped the phone and started cursing. What a fucking buffoon. You can't put the genie back in the bottle after saying something like that. But I had to hear the rest before immediately burning the bridge in a first rage.

""...But I wouldn't do that because of your thing. She's really pretty and you should stick with her for a long time.""

All I could muster in my shock was, ""I hope you wouldn't, friend""


Awkwardly wrapped up the conversation and immediately told my girlfriend. She apologized to me... Which is kind of heartbreaking and what she said next, ""You were the first guy I've been with who hasn't dealt with something like this... Until now. It's funny how guys think I don't get a choice in who fucks me"" -- sorry, ladies, I have no concept of what dealing with this bullshit must be like, but I hate it for ya'll.


So I slept on it. Although it wasn't easy to get to sleep because I felt such a deep betrayal. Woke up and shot Stinky a text cancelling his vacation to stay here. Told him my only regret was trying to be cool when what I should have done is call him out on his shit immediately.


Girlfriend is beyond cool and told me it was my choice after I told her she had the final say on whether or not anyone stays in a home that is equally hers. I have zero concerns about her loyalty -- I just don't want her feeling objectified, even if it was something said privately, which still massively breached bro code.

Later I heard her whining saying that someone shrunk her pants, I told her that it was me, but I wasn't going to buy a new pair. My reasoning is because when we used to babysit together I would do all the work. I'd feed the kids, play with them, clean up after them, change their diapers, etc. As soon as their parents left my sister would plop down on the couch and play on her phone all day. Basically she would get paid $30 for playing on her phone all day. Another reason is she treats me like shit. I just have to look in her direction when she's in a mood, and she starts screaming telling me to shut up. Another reason is that she has stolen from me before. It was only $10, which doesn't sound like much, but it was to me considering that was a third of what I got paid every two weeks, but it's more than just the money, just the fact that I did all the work and then she had the audacity to steal from her own brother. After shrinking her pants i just really didn't think she deserved a new pair, I don't know if that makes me an asshole or not, but that is how I feel.

Edit: Lots of people are saying I'm the asshole, which is perfectly understandable.

c10w2m	2019-06-15 19:07:41	itsleilani	AITA for not letting my grandmother “touch” me ?	"Hi
sorry if this will be a misleading title, and im currently on mobile so I apologize for any formatting, grammar, etc. i do make many letters lowercase if you notice. 
I’ll try to make this short.

So my grandmother (who is in her 50’s) had lung cancer. She did beat it (thank god) but due to stress (and other complications) there is a chance she’ll get it a second time.

She does have many problems and is not really mentally well at the moment, but does love us. there’s days where she’s adoring us, and many where were either arguing or completely ignoring each other. Most of the time she does talk things like how she’s going to run away, and she can’t stand everyone, even if whoever she brings up did nothing to her.

Now i slept over at her house a lot as a kid (long story due to a verbally/physically abusive alcoholic father, in which i was terrified to go home) and still do, so we sleep in the same bed. It’s been a few years since those dark times that im still affected by, and one of those is i don’t like to be touched. 

It’s nothing inappropriate, mostly rubbing and stuff. i don’t know how to describe it. She does it out of love i know that, nothing like a predator way. She’s noticed many times me either not giving eye contact when she does this, or moving my hand (or leg or whatever she’s touching) away. I don’t mind hugging anyone (she claims it’s hugging as well) and don’t mind receiving kisses, but i grew up finding them disgusting, resulting in never wanting to give one, and still don’t. (Also having to do with bio father).

What makes it worse is she always mentions how she does it when im asleep, and don’t even know it, which makes me more uncomfortable.

I expressed how I felt about the touching situation, and she responded with “I don’t believe that, don’t come to me with that”. Even my mom kind of finds it bizarre. I honestly don’t know why I feel like this and I do feel bad about it.
AITA ?

c10vuq	2019-06-15 19:07:08	UnhappyWriting9	AITA for not returning my friend's, who claims he's dying, phone call?	"I've been friends with this guy Jamie since elementary school. We dating in high school, but we broke up because he kissed my best friend Lucy. (Who is still my best friend.) I know it seems weird I'm still friends with both of them, but high school kids are stupid and I don't hold a grudge against things people did while they were kids. So Jamie has a lot of emotional problems now, and has failed to launch. I'm 25 and just started a job at a big law firm, and I'm studying to take the bar exam right now.  So needless to say I don't have a lot of free time. Almost none. Jamie is always dealing with self esteem issues and when he calls I stop to talk to him sometimes. Sometimes he gets too flirty and weird and I'll ask him to stop that he's making me uncomfortable, but he won't stop. He'll tell me he loves me, jokes that he wants to get married, calls me names like ""beautiful, lovely, dear, etc."" 

&#x200B;

Anyways, he's been saying for the past few weeks that he's been in the hospital and has been having seizures. But when he says this he like begs me to ask him why he was in the hospital or is sick, and I feel like I'm being manipulated. So on tuesday  he called me a few times and when I went to lunch I picked up the phone. He sounded like he was on drugs or drunk or something and told me he was dying of leukemia, after a weird set of me asking him about it, he changed and said that he had liver cancer. Then he told me it's actually something wrong with his spleen. When I questioned him about what drugs he was on and what his diagnosis was, he wouldn't give me a straight answer and would not tell me his diagnosis. He would just answer with ""why do you care?"" and I knew he was trying to get me to say something like ""oh I love you."" But I don't, and I don't feel comfortable saying that to him. So after a while I got frustrated with him and hung up the phone. I called Lucy and told her what was going on, and she said that she keeps telling him she's not interested in dating him, but he calls and texts her relentlessly too, and tells her he's very depressed. After I hung up on him he called me twice and I didn't answer. After I didn't answer he sent me a text that said ""Fine. I was only trying to apologize for putting everything on you. I kind of love you you twerp."" I haven't talked to him since tuesday and he has called me several times throughout the week.

I feel bad, because I don't really believe he is sick, and that he is being selfish and trying to keep attention on him while I'm busy. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c10v65	2019-06-15 19:05:28	witchyyyyy1595	WIBTA if I complained to my landlord about the barking dog upstairs?	"On mobile sorry for any formatting/auto correct issues!! 

My boyfriend and I recently moved, and we’ve been living here for about a month. We live in the one building that allows pets. The neighbors upstairs have a little dog that barks the entire time they’re gone. Right now, for example, it’s been barking since about 9am. It barks the moment they leave to the moment they come home. 

Side note - our landlord made it clear to us that if there were any issues of noise, that he wanted to know, as he wanted everyone to live in peace. 

My boyfriend mentioned to the guy that lives there, and he was apologetic, and said they try to drop it off at other peoples houses when they’re going to be gone. It got better during the week, but it seems like every weekend they leave it home. I have weekends off so I’m  home listening to the damn dog almost the whole time. If I play music or turn the tv on it somewhat drowns it out, but it’s still. There. Plus I don’t want to watch tv the whole time I’m home! 

We’ve talked to one of their neighbors and it sounded like they were annoyed about it as well, and that the people with the dog are aware of the issue, so I think it’s been going on for a while. 

I feel really bad complaining as it has gotten better. Nobody lived in our unit for 2 years, so we almost think they didn’t realize how bad the barking was (they are a unit in between two other units though, so the argument is flimsy as I’m sure they can hear it). If this is the case, I feel like an asshole coming in and immediately complaining to the landlord, especially if they are trying to help it. I know it’s probably impossible to find a dog-sitter every time they’re at work. 

I want to mention it to them again, but my boyfriend tried to go talk to them at one point, and they didn’t answer the door when he knocked. 

We’ve gotten the impression from other neighbors that everyone here is really friendly with each other, so we don’t want to be the people that move in and start complaining. I contemplated getting a high pitched whistle or something to try and get it to stop, but the research I did indicated that cats can hear those too, and we have a cat.  

I feel like an asshole because it has gotten a little better, but I just want them to know it’s unacceptable for it to be this loud for this long. Other neighbors in our building have dogs and you hear a bark every now and then but never for this long. 

So... WIBTA for complaining about something that only happens every once and a while? I cannot emphasize enough that it barks the ENTIRE time they’re gone. Would it be better to talk to the neighbors rather than the landlord? My boyfriend and I were dead set to complain at one point but it got better so we didn’t.

She’s bipolar but she takes her meds now, so she’s not that bad, but when she gets in a low spot she always tells me what’s bothering her and why. When she does this she often tells me multiple times in a row. The first few times I tell her what I think and try to help. 

She also likes to very loudly interrupt me when I try to help. At some point I tell her that if she does not listen to what Im saying, then i will not listen to what she’s  saying. She gets very frustrated when i do this. She also gets mad when I point out that she’s already told me what she’s telling me, them continues to talk about it to me.

c10szk	2019-06-15 19:00:18	bananatruck867	AITA because my sister and dad left their trip here early?	"Throwaway. 

I’m a PA student, finishing out rotations 4 hours away from home. I’ve been traveling away for about 8/10 of the past months, and my family members said they’d visit me but never did. Finally, it’s my last weekend, I told my dad he should come up by train for Father’s Day weekend. We can see museums, go to history sites he likes, I’d get a hotel with breakfast. Two days later, he said he probably won’t, so I told my sister people can’t complain they never see me if they make little effort. The next day, he said he and my sister were going to come up Friday. Ok, reservation made, cool. 

Friday, I leave work early to pick them up from the station. We go sight  seeing, get dinner, go to hotel. Fewhours pass and Im ready to go to bed and I tel my sister I need that side of the bed for the outlet so I can charge my phone. She told me “no, that’s too bad, use the other side.”

Me: that side has no outlet, come on, I got this hotel room, I want to use the outlet. 

Her: I’m not moving suck it up, sleep on the floor

At this point she yells for my dad who says he’s staying out of it, then says “why are you always such a b-tch all the time.” I sit down on the other bed, close my eyes, and just go to sleep. But every 5 minutes she says something like “why is -name- such a nasty girl?” “Aw you’re so sad and upset you couldn’t get the outlet, so vewy sad. God you’re selfish.” She then tells my dad she is changing their train to leave the next day instead of Sunday. 

Morning comes, they sleep til past noon. My dad asks her what they’re doing, if they need a cab or I’ll drive them, she says she’ll get them an Uber into the city. He thought I said something but she said “no she’s just sitting there smirking. Come on, she’s selfish. God she’s so nasty” 

They go to leave, I haven’t said a word, im just sitting there in the chair. She goes “sorry -name- ruined your Father’s Day weekend. She’s so selfish she messed up your entire trip, sorry she wasted it.” To which he replied “yeah happy Father’s Day to me.”

AITA? She was being just mean so I literally sat, rolled over, and went to bed. Now I’m in a hotel alone because I prepaid both nights, crying my eyes out, while she’s in the city with my dad, who turned his phone off and said he won’t put t back on u til they’re home.

Edit: I chose a job 4 hours away because if They told me not to move too far. I don’t know how I could possibly accommodate them any more than I do. I’m asking this because I’m made out to be the bad guy. Phones are still off"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c10sez	2019-06-15 18:58:54	Wanttoreadmybook	AITA for wanting alone time?	"Back story before the argument. GF and I are in a long distance relationship. I work a very demanding (long hours) and high stress job. In the last months it's not uncommon for me to work 10-12+ hour days right through the weekend. Obviously this puts a strain on our relationship because it means I'm stressed more and there is less time for us to talk. Communication is already an issue (something I consider inherent to a long distance relationship). 

After a long 12 days straight of work I finally have a weekend off and figure being fathers day I should make the drive down home to spend some time with the old man. Today (Saturday) he had to go into work for a few hours so I had the house to myself.
 Gf asks what I'm up to and I text back that I'm having some relaxing time alone and may finish the book I've been reading for over a year (how did it start again?). An hour later she calls me and I decline the call. I'm having some alone time. I text her that I'm reading and she texts me back ""just say hi"" and calls me again. 

I pick up and I'm not too thrilled. We end up getting in an argument where she says she just wanted to say a quick hello and see how I'm doing. I tell her thanks but I'm reading my book and I don't want to talk. She gets all upset and says fine then I'll go, holding back tears. She hangs up and I call back.

 I try to explain she isn't being respectful to me; she knows I don't get this type of self quality time often but still feels she has the right to interrupt it even if it's ""only for a quick minute."" She doesn't see the problem with it. From her perspective she just wanted to let me know she was thinking of me and thinks I should be happy to know that. I told her she could do it in a less distracting way like a text, snapchat, or voice message. She says that since I'm with family and friends for the weekend she knows there won't be much time for her and she just wanted to talk. We went back and forth but in the end she is still hurt that I wouldn't make the exception of alone time for her. 

AITA for prioritizing time for myself over time with her? I know she was coming from a good place (wanting time together) but can't seem to see that I need some for myself too. I end up feeling bad and my mood ruined... Maybe I'll finish the book next year!"	No A-holes here	0	0

"We started watching Game of Thrones years ago and we've watched every episode together since. *(edit: I had watched the entire first season alone before she jumped on. we re-watched it together.)* She didn't like it at first, but it grew on her. It's kind of ""our"" show. Since we're in Europe, the episodes air at 4am, which means we've never watched them live. Sometimes it takes *days* for her to get around to watching it with me, even though she claims she really loves the show. Sometimes we even had a backlog of 2-3 episodes!

She didn't seem to like the show at all since season 7. She spent more time on /r/freefolk hating on the show than she actually did watching it. I, on the other hand, was still excited about it (am not anymore...) Since I'm a night owl and I sometimes happened to be awake when the episodes aired, I did watch a few episodes on my own. Without her. Later I would watch the episode again, this time with her, and not tell her that I'd already seen everything. I don't mind watching things twice.

I've told her before that I sometimes do this, and then she got really angry. Today I told her in passing that I did it with S08E03, and she's still really angry.

c10re2	2019-06-15 18:56:21	callmethewildrose	AITA for skipping a big family party to go to an amateur wrestling show?	"Me - 25[F]. 

Every year, my cousins (who live 3-ish hours away) host a huge summer party at their house. They go all out with food and invite pretty much everyone they know, including a lot of my family that I don’t see too often. I always try to go, because a lot of my relatives are getting older, and I want to make memories with them whenever I can. Last year, I went and spent time with my uncle, who passed a few months after. I was very grateful that I got to go and see him one last time. 

My partner of 8 years, somehow, has never gone to a single one of my cousins’ summer parties - he’s met all my family on other holidays or at other parties, but somehow he’s always working or on vacation when this specific one rolls around. I don’t really mind that much, since he sees most of the family I’m close to during other parts of the year. But since he felt bad, a few months ago, he actually took off the specific weekend it’s happening just so he could go with me. As such, we both planned on going. 

However, about a month ago, I let the date of the big summer blowout slip my mind and bought me and my boyfriend tickets to an amateur wrestling show that’s coming through town. It’s a very silly, campy shindig, one that I’ve really wanted to see since I got into wrestling. I was very excited - so excited that I didn’t really notice the tickets were the non-refundable kind. I just dropped the $100 on impulse and signed us both up. 

Well, my mom called me a few days ago to confirm I was going to the party this year, and that’s when I realized I had double-booked. When I told her that I had bought tickets to something else, she seemed really sad. She first mentioned how my relatives were getting older, especially my aunt. Then she mentioned that my partner had never gone to this party, and that she was hoping he’d make it this year. She also asked me where I got a sudden interest in wrestling from, which made me feel a little guilty - it’s a new hobby, so it probably shouldn’t be as important as seeing my relatives. She didn’t really guilt me hard, but I’m a bit sensitive to that stuff, so I told her I’d try to see what I could do to make it. 

The thing is - I kinda still want to go to the wrestling event.  Not just because I spent money on tickets, but because I want to see the show really badly. But I also realize that if I don’t go to the party, I might regret not making more memories later. Which makes me feel like a jerk. 

The party’s in two weeks, so I have to make a decision soon. I just don’t want to make a choice that simultaneously makes me an asshole.

c10r0c	2019-06-15 18:55:22	super_soprano13	AITA For wanting my work to enforce a rule so I stop being sick all the time	"So I work at a place that has a fragrance free policy. That means no scented lotions or perfumes body sprays etc. They also have a more strict ""no scent zone"" where I sit bc of an ada accommodation because scents trigger my migraines and extended or severe migraines trigger my seizures (I have absence, temporal lobe, and tonic clonic seizures which are generally controlled by high doses of a topirimate compound under the brand name of Qudexy XR. I take 400mg every night. It's pretty hardcore shit)

Lately, there have been more and more blatant rule violations of these rules. In the no scent zone, we're not supposed to use scented anything. Deodorant, hair spray, laundry detergent, no strong smelling drinks, anything. Whenever something is heavily scented, I message our team lead group and they do a walk around. For the past month I have had 4 separate instances of a migraine that lead to a seizure. One was so severe that I missed a full day of work and had two straight days of chained temporal lobe seizures that lead to my neuro switching me from the medication I had been on previously (trokendi) to the one I'm on now (Qudexy) and ordering a VEEG, which is a 4-5 day in hospital video and audio monitored EEG.

I have twice emailed specifically to complain and inform them of complications that these continued triggers could involved which include potential bodily injury from the physical action of convulsive (tonic clonic) seizure activity, bodily injury to myself and others because of lack of awareness during absence and severe temporal lobe episodes, brain damage from extended episodes, SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy), memory loss, continued loss of vocabulary fluency and range of communication skills, continued increase in severity of anxiety and depression, panic attack during temporal lobe episodes etc. The most that occurs is other employees if specifically identified as the source of fragrance get moved. There is presidence for charging those who trigger epileptic episodes with assault. I also have a service dog and deal daily with folks interfering with him despite my requesting that something be done about that. Interference with a service dog is a class six felony. I've requested that both of these things be dealt with more severely or at least be a more intensive part of our training. There is federal and state law to back me up but my management team is wishy washy and our lower level management is reticent at best to be helpful. 90% of the time it's the same 3-4 people of about 20 who respond. If they aren't there I'm in pain and waiting for the inevitable.

Am I just an asshole?

**Edit 1:

Tl;Dr: scents trigger migraines trigger seizures. Company was fragrance free before I showed up. Management *was aware of my condition* when they hired me I have an accommodation to sit in strict no scent zone. Enforcement is none existent. Am I the asshole for demanding enforcement improve bc it's making my health and attendance decline?**



ALSO FOR THE RECORD: I don't have seizures just walking around because outside is VENTILATED that's part of being outside. And if you read the whole thing you'll see I'm regularly in contact and have regular neurologist appointments and discuss my meds and treatment with them. I'm dealing with work and specific triggers, not the condition as a whole. I'm a 31 year old epileptic who takes high doses of anticonvulsant medication, not a fool."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c10pd5	2019-06-15 18:51:11	GrillMaster3	WIBTA If I confronted my friend about her possible self esteem issues?	"Well, I’m back. Y’all gave some good advice last time, so I’m back to get some more, this time with stupid high school friend drama.

So, I used to have a really big friend group. I’m talking 30 kids that always hung out together for half of our freshman year. The issue arose when one kid (Code Name: John) decided to start dating another girl in the group, who I’ll call Julia. 

Now they dated for a month, but when they broke up, it was UGLY. They refused to be in the same room, they both said HORRIBLE things about each other, and the drama lasted till June (the breakup happened in January) with the last of the fallout disappearing in September of this year. This left us with a small, close-knit group of about 6 or 7 of us that’ve all been sticking together, because if we don’t, we’re completely alone.

Julia is SUPER pretty, so she talks to guys on occasion. There’s this one guy who she dated April who I’ll call James. Ima be real with you, James was a huge mistake. He had a lot of problems with his self-image, and he broke up with her after a month. They still liked each other, so in July of this past summer, they got back together before breaking up again. THEN after that, in November, he drunk texted her to meet up, they got back together AGAIN until about early January when she found out he’d been cheating. I swear this is important for the story.

So all this happens, but it didn’t really effect our core group of girls. It made her really sad for a while, but she eventually recovered and things went back to normal. Then... she joined Newspaper, and I joined track.

The reason this is relevant is because there’s this guy in both track and newspaper who I’ll call Joe. Joe is funny, smart, cute, athletic, tall, nice... basically the whole package. So of course both of us liked him. He ended up liking her and asking her out, so whatever. I got over it in a day, I don’t like him anymore. 

So then recently they actually went on a date, and they’re borderline official. They walk past each other in the hallway while he’s with his friends, and he refuses to say hi to her. He still texts her and stuff, but when other people are around he won’t talk to her. All of us get worried, so I talked to her about it.

She confides in me that she feels doesn’t feel good about herself without having guys be interested in her, and if she doesn’t have a boyfriend she feels like she’s not worth much. I listened, but as time’s gone on and we’ve all been concern about Joe’s lack of a spine to her, and how we don’t think this will turn out well, she’s steadfast in saying that she wants to date him.

I’m really worried that, considering her previous dating track record, she’s going to drive herself down a really self-destructive path thanks to her possible self-esteem/self-image problems, and I’m concerned.

Would I be an asshole if I confronted her about it and expressed my concern without sugarcoating it? I’m worried that something bad is going to happen if I don’t say something."	Asshole	0	0

I haven't had a paying job as of yet because I have literally spent the last 6 years gaining ""experience"" in my desired career so people will actually hire me. I'm now finally ready to get a job, so I figured the reasonable idea would be to move in with my girlfriend of 4 and a half years, as we've been wanting to start our lives together, settle down, etc, she lives 100 miles from my parents home, but a trip I have been able to make consistently for years, every two weeks or so. 

Over the last 3 years I have been talking of my plan to move in with my girlfriend. Recently, with all my work experience complete, my dad in  particular talks how moving to my girlfriend's town would be a bad idea. He says I need to be established financially before I make any decisions. I have done the maths. Between my girlfriend and I's paychecks, we'd not only be able to live, but live comfortably. We'd be fine. As far as I can tell, there's no problem financially. I told my dad I have an interview up here yesterday and he told me straight up that it was a bad idea, he went on about how I need to be established. He told me I would have no financial support or emotional support. Which is true. I'd have no financial support which is why I need to get a job. That's life? As for emotional support, I am close with my girlfriend's family also, and theres no reason why I wouldn't phone my parents once every 2 or 3 days. Plus, I said I'd be willing to visit every weekend or so. But my parents have come off as if I did what I've been planning to do, to put down roots where I want to live, I'd be completely disappointing them. 

I know I sound crazy typing this out, basically seeking validation on it. But my parents raised, I get it, I'm not ungrateful for it, do I have to live with my parents? Is there a time a you're allowed to move out? I desperately don't want to disappoint them, I don't want to disappear from their lives, I love them both.

After getting off work, I ran an errand and came home to make dinner. I didn't sit down until almost 8pm, at which point I'm exhausted and really uncomfortable since I'm still dealing with getting over a medical issue (some advil would help, but it wasn't quite time for the next dose). 

My spouse (S) exited their home office at about 8:45 and said we should go next door to wish BIL a happy birthday since we're right here. I initially agreed, and started to get up. After standing for a couple minutes, I realized how uncomfortable I was and that going next door would be pretty painful. I told S I was going to stay home, that we'll see them the next day. S responded it would be a 10 minute trip (which is unrealistic - minimum 30 min, knowing the in laws).

c10nsr	2019-06-15 18:47:08	HuryMad	AITA for getting angry at a friend when they blanked me?	"So I've been friends with this person for a while and we've gotten quite close.

A few days ago, They were in a pretty bad mood and I was talking to them through text, trying to help them feel better.

They then send me and all of our friends a text saying that they're uninstalling their social media apps and if anyone needs them, we can text them.

However I didnt have their number so I asked them for it and expectedly, no reply.

A few days pass and I get a text from them as if nothing had happened. After talking for a bit, I express my frustration with being blanked. They then say that I am taking things too personally.

After a bit more talking, I wish them the best of luck with figuring things out and leave it there. They then say that I'm sulking and that when I am ready to be mature and sort things out, to text them.

Am I the asshole here?

c10mu5	2019-06-15 18:44:45	maoisadorable	WIBTA if I pack my family and leave my in-laws house after one night (supposed to be here a week) because they obviously lied about not smoking in the house?	"I'm 35, been married 16 years to my true love who is 38. We have an amazing life together and two kids aged 6 and 2. As perfect as he and our kids are, I can't stand his mom and her boyfriend. According to my husband after his dad died ~20 years ago his mom went off the deep end and she ""used"" to be nice. We'll all I've ever known her is to be a bitter old woman who is insatiably mean, lies constantly and tries to use our kids against us. 

It was massively against my better judgment that I agreed to stay at their house for our summer vacation. My husband is a pilot in the military and he has a weeks worth of TDY in our hometown so we figured it would be a good time to go home and see friends and family. I had wanted to stay in a nice Embassy Suites where we would have plenty of space but my MIL called me crying that she ""doesn't even know her grandkids"" and this is the perfect opportunity for she and I to try and mend fences. I told her that based on our past experiences, she could buy the kids one gift per the trip, she had to limit snacks and treats to once a day and her boyfriend had to stop smoking in the house now (actually 3 months ago) to try and give it a chance to air out. She promised she would abide by this. 

We drove up to their house late last night and not only could you tell that he'd been smoking in the house recently, I actually think he'd put a cigarette out as we were ringing the doorbell. The air was just heavy with cigarette smoke. It was well past midnight and the kids were exhausted so I didn't make a big deal of it and tried to sleep. But her boyfriend is a passive aggressive ass and he stood right outside our bedroom smoking all night and I swear I could smell it coming in through the swamp cooler that is right outside the window. 

My husband could tell I was upset but he had to get up early for training this morning but pleaded with me not to do anything rash until he had the chance to get back and talk with his mom. I agreed. I would have not said a single word to her but she actually barged into the room (door was closed) at 6:30AM to tell me how proud I should be of her that she's able to keep her promises. I told her the house still smelled like smoke and how Rod was smoking right outside our window. She told me that wasn't true and nobody had smoked inside the house for months. I told her I just didn't believe her and it turned into a full blown argument. We hadn't even been there for 7 hours yet. 

I took the kids to see my high school best friend as an avoidance method and I seriously don't want to go back to her house. My kids love her because she spoils them like crazy so they would be very upset if we don't stay there and my husband would be mad if I make a unilateral decision to move us into the hotel. 

Would I be the asshole if I just say screw it and book us a hotel for the rest of the week?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c10mkq	2019-06-15 18:44:06		"WIBTA for ""ghosting"" someone for lying about her age on Tinder?"	"I met a woman on Tinder. Her age said 26. I am 40. I wasn't specifically seeking someone in her 20s, but I'm certainly open to it (I prefer late 20s and 30s because I still want to have kids). 

Before we met, I wondered if she was older than 26 based on her profile pics - I would have guessed mid-30s. I asked a friend and he guessed 33. I am a trusting person and do not assume people are lying - it's just that she looked older. 

I gave her the benefit of the doubt, as she certainly *could* be 26 from the pics.

So I meet up with her and we had a pleasant time eating and chatting and taking a stroll. Based on her appearance and details that came up (e.g., there would be a huge age gap with her older siblings if she were truly 26), I am pretty darn sure she isn't 26. We have never discussed age and she has never said that she is 26 outside of her Tinder profile, though she should certainly clarify if it's a mistake.

WIBTA for ghosting her? Our date ended on a nice note, though I'm pretty turned off about the age thing. It's even possible she's in her 40s, which is not my preference. I don't want to bring it up to her - it's uncomfortable for me and for her."		1	0
c10m10	2019-06-15 18:42:35	curvykirby1	AITA for advising my friend to work instead of being a trophy wife?	"My friend and I graduated nursing school this spring. For the past 3 years, she's been dating a professional athlete, who is also in his early 20s. They got engaged in December and are planning to marry in August. He is wealthy for his age, but despite that he's a very sweet and grounded guy with a promising career in front of him. They are truly in love. I am going to be one of her bridesmaids.

Yesterday, I asked about where she planned to work. She said she's ""not sure"" and said that she wants to wait until after she gets married to see. With her fiance's job, there's a lot of moving around every few years. She says she really wants to start a family with him and focus on that, maybe get a part-time job or work from home (e.g. telehealth). He is also fine with this, and in fact encourages it.

I told her that it's her life and her choices, but that it would be wise if she established a proper career as well. She still hasn't gotten her license yet. I asked her if her parents were okay with her wanting to be a trophy wife, and she got offended. She said that they want her to be happy above anything, and she's not even sure if she wants to be a nurse. I said that she should at least try, given all the hard work and effort she put into getting this degree. 

She was cold with me after our conversation. I definitely angered her, but I think someone needs to say this to her. Maybe I'm just an idealist, but I find it sad that she wants to be a trophy wife instead of using her skills to care for sick people. Plus, I came from a place of genuine love and concern. Her mother is a rather materialistic woman so I doubt she's spoken sense to her yet."	Asshole	0	0

It was fun I guess. Lots of banter. Afterwards he told me to come to his room so we can watch some videos. E3 was last week and he insisted on me watching some of the trailers. I already watched e3 myself live but he didn't care. So I sat down on his bed and he was showing me the cyberpunk 2077 trailer on his bed and he just relaxed his head on my shoulder and put his leg on me. I just rolled with it... Then after the trailer he was looking at me for a few seconds, like staring at me and I asked him what was up and then he just kissed me with his..with his tongue slobbering all over my mouth and I threw him off of me and literally left and ran home.

c10lgz	2019-06-15 18:41:09		AITA For not hanging out with a friend I live with because of his SO?	"I’ve know him for 10 years, he’s lived with me for just over a year, and he’s been with his SO for 3-4 years. Their relationship was great and then became way too toxic. For the last year and a half she’s been  secluding him all to herself. She’s incredibly rude and he is too when she’s around. I’ve just stopped being around him all together. I still say hi, ask about his day, and watch tv with him on occasion but I’ve gone from spending hours with him every day to about 30 minutes a week and he’s noticed. He is constantly trying to get my attention but I just stay in my room or out of the house most of the time. Our other roommate has done the same for even longer than I have and he’s also a good friend of ours. The roommate in question feels like he’s hated by the house now. 

So now my roommate is alone whenever his SO isn’t around and I kind of feel guilty, but no part of me wants to risk hanging out with him and her popping by again unannounced so I just avoid him all together. And yes, I have talked to him about her more than a couple times. He acknowledges her behavior but makes excuses to no end and she’s only been getting worse."		1	0
c10l03	2019-06-15 18:40:03	Rivsmama	AITA for telling my 5 year old he could dye his hair blue for the summer, without consulting my husband?	"Idk I'm having trouble with this one. I really don't think I'm wrong here, but I'm also biased because people don't usually think they are. 

So, I have a 5 year old. Blonde hair, blue eyes, freaking adorable little guy. He asked me about a week ago if he could make his hair blue. I said, ""yeah we can do that when you get out of school for summer break."" 

Yesterday, I bought some manic panic for my own hair, and he asked me if I got blue for his hair. I reminded him that school wasn't out yet, and we weren't doing his hair until then. My husband was standing there and asked me what I was talking about. I explained, and he got pissed. He said I was NOT dying our sons hair blue and he wasn't going to have his kid walking around looking like a punk and some other not nice things. He said as his dad, he should have a say in things like that.

 I got mad too, because I have facial piercings and used to always have crazy colors in my hair, because I thought it was fun, and he shamed me into taking all my stuff out and keeping my hair natural. He says adults don't have those things and I need to grow up. He would also say how ugly it looked and stuff. I'm pretty sure he just hates that stuff in general, which is fine, but I don't. 

And I am the only one who takes care of our kids. I'm talking 100% of the time. He works a lot. I'm not saying anything bad about him, but if I'm the one who is with the kids, I feel like this IS my choice. I was probably just going to get spray in stuff so that if he didn't want blue hair anymore, we could just wash it out at the end of the day. I don't see the problem."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We went out a couple of times and recently he seemed to be quite adamant that he wanted me to treat him for my new job. I thought that was a bit unusual, considering he never treated me when he got his job, I thought that nullified the whole thing. Regardless, I accepted and took him to drinks and dinner and even paid for his cab back home. Cost me a bomb, but I decided to go through with it at the time. 

He texts me a week after saying that hes got an off from work and would love to meet up. I told him yes, and it that he could use this opportunity to treat me back for his job as a chef at a five star. He completely sidestepped the question!! He then told me he was coming to my part of town and would like to catch up on drinks and a night of partying on the very same day. I should tell you that I am not a party person who likes to stay up at night, but found it pretty hard to say no. I accepted and when the time came to meet him at the pub, I called him. He refused to pick up only to call me back 2 hours later saying that his phone had been acting up, but that he had already begun partying with one of his other friends. I thought that was a bit rich. For context, he does not earn a lot and that might be why he doesnt want to treat me. I still think he should have at least called me when he came to my part of town and went drinking though, especially when I had agreed to it despite my preference otherwise.

c10irh	2019-06-15 18:34:21	NoncompliantWonder	AITA I'm rude to random strangers hitting on me.	"Okay, I know how this sounds already but to give a little context I'm asexual. I have no interest in sexual relationships of any kind. 

Unfortunately mother nature has a sense of humor because as my roommates often say: ""That's such a waste."" So you can guess the issues this causes.

I'm not the type to surround myself with friends when I leave my dorms so at least once in my daily rounds I'm stopped by a guy. The lines very from ""Can I get your number?"" to ""Hey girl, you looking fine as hell.""

I used to be nice to these random strangers after all they don't know my preferences and can't be expected to. After all they just saw me and had to talk to me. I used to let them down easy and just say I'm ace but this caused more issues. They'd ask why don't I give them a chance or i should give dick a try or even say I'm making it up.

Something had to change so, I made my disinterest obvious and my rejections short and loud. No more arguing and meekly trying to tell people that I have to go only to be ranted at about being ugly anyways.
I honestly don't feel good about it most of the time but I want to believe that it's better then wasting both of our time.

Recently my roommates have told me that I'm so mean to these guys but they just don't see it from my perspective. I understand this it's hard for guys to get the confidence to talk to girl they think is pretty but I didn't ask them to hit on me and I have the right to my own day and I don't enjoy them approaching me at random when all I want is a box of fruit snacks at the grocery store when I'm alone. 

But tell me if I'm wrong or being to hard on them. I'm not exactly satisfied with the way I'm handling this but I haven't found a better solution and if you have any tips for this I'd love to hear it.

Edit: After reading a few responses I need to give a few more details. No, I don't actually yell at them unless they make me by touching me or something. When I am approached I give them a firm ""No, thank you"" or ""Your making me uncomfortable."" and I speed walk away. The responses to me doing this is mixed all around. My roommates say I'm being mean and guys will yell that I'm a bitch which is why I made the post.

Thanks to those who offered advice. I will take it to heart and keep it in mind next time it happens."	Not the A-hole	0	0

As you all know father’s day is tomorrow. My husband and I are first time parents and I just recently celebrated my first Mother’s Day, although it was kinda shitty due to the fact that my husband had inadvertently made plans with one of his buddies to attend the Byron Nelson, it was nice to have gotten to spend the day with my daughter. Well, about a week ago I asked my husband to clear his social calendar for Father’s Day weekend because I intended on hosting a small pool party for him, immediate family and a few friends. He hesitated, arguing that Father’s Day weekend should be about him being able to enjoy a hobby he enjoys such as golf or going fishing but agreed to do so anyway. Well the party is set to take place this afternoon and my husband just called to let me know that he feels uncomfortable attending this party because he’s our daughters father only and not anyone else’s. I explained to him that I simply wanted to celebrate him with our friends and family and although he is dreading having to attend, he agreed to do so. As soon as I hung up the phone with him I was annoyed that he was so bothered by the fact that I simply wanted to celebrate him as a father so I called everyone I invited and told them the party was cancelled.

He claims having the word “not” in the account name implies I’m not the one posting so I shouldn’t be bothered by it. He also said because my social media accounts are public and have my name in them I shouldn’t feel offended that he’s using my name (he uses fake names for his). I told him that that wasn’t the point, that it was a matter of control. I don’t mind using my name in my social media because it’s mine, and I post things I don’t mind having associated with me in real life.

c10fac	2019-06-15 18:25:38	Jonislove	AITA for taking back my money from a charity organisation that supports deaf people?	"A person who was deaf was collecting donations came up to me while I was eating dinner at a restaurant asking for donations. This charity organisation had a weird system where if you donated $10, you would be able to write your name on a card, which I assume will recognise you for your act. Although I am still studying at a considerably young age, I tried to give her the most I could possibly spare.  I decided to hand her a $5 bill, and as I handed her the bill, she had this look of unsatisfaction on her face. 

Due to me not reading the instructions Clearly, as I proceeded to write my name, the lady quickly pulls back and shows me the amount that must be donated so I could write my name. As I sat there just realising to the mistake I made, the women just walks off. No sign of appreciation or sign of gratitude she just walks away with my money. Now, I understand that $5 is not a lot of money but I am a student and to me and where I come from, $5 does many things.

At that moment, I had the suspicion that this might be a scam.  It was a conflicting thought, I believed that whatever you give should not have a limit and should be always appreciated as long as you don't give something insulting like a 25 cent coin. But on the other hand, I believed that some people who donates hundreds or thousands of dollars to charity SHOULD be recognised and appreciated. 

But whatever the thought was, I decided to take my money back. I kindly tried to call her back, and as she reached my table, I had to kindly ask for my money back. At first she didn't get what I was talking about, but when I kindly pointed to my $5, she knew what i was talking about. She pulled this really unhappy face and sort of had refusingly returned back my $5. It took her a long 2 minutes to give me back my money so much so that I had to lightly tug it away from her as I thought she didn't get the message. As I put the money back into my wallet, she had this really unpleasant look on her face as she walked away. I felt bad, but at the same time, I can't help but feel like I just got out of a scam.

c10azk	2019-06-15 18:14:55	Call_Me_Clark	WIBTA for asking potential roommates who cancelled on me to pay for part of my new rent?	"A few months ago, I was offered my first job out of college. It’s in a high-cost of living area of the country, and I’m from the Midwest, so it was a cross country move. I had no connections there, and found a roommate ad on Craigslist. Sketchy, I know, but I vetted them carefully and they seemed like nice, normal professionals who wanted a third roommate. The rent was good for the area, $1200/month. 

Two months before move-in, I signed a roommate agreement (not a lease) which included terms for moving in and out - thirty days’ notice for all parties. I paid a deposit equal to one month of rent, and thought all was well. 

Three weeks before move-in, they message me and tell me that they have a friend moving to the area who they would like to live with them, and if I’d be ok splitting my room with the new friend until I found a new place. I expressed my concerns, and they promised that I would have a place to stay and that they’d help me however they could. You may be able to tell where this is going (They sent my deposit back to me in until we could decide a new deposit and rent deal, and insisted on signing a new roommate agreement).

A week later, they pull the rug out and tell me that I’m no longer welcome. They send me some Craigslist links for new places to check out (I had already contacted them as I saw them a week prior). I told them that two weeks was not enough notice for a cross country move, and they were unsympathetic and (I believe) muted me. 

I found a new place, at $700 more per month - it’s much nicer, but it’s also more than I need and all I was able to find without a significant commute. I feel very lucky to have landed on my feet, but I can’t help but feel that the broken roommate agreement (whether it’s legally binding or not) gives them some responsibility.

Now I know birthdays are just technically another normal day and I’m getting a bit too old for them (22F) but it would have been nice to receive a text or even a verbal “Happy Birthday” even if they forgot to get a present. Especially, considering I try my best to remember all the birthdays in my family and get everyone gifts. Heck I wouldn’t even mind a hug as a present. 

But nope, after my parents treated us to dinner, we passed by a bakery and I hinted that a cupcake on display looked pretty nice, there was no response (it was only $2.50). I thought my sisters (18 and 15) and I were close but today really sucked. And it’s not like they don’t care about birthdays as they themselves enjoy planning and getting gifts among their respective Friend groups. Heck the youngest one even asked me what she should get as a gift for her Friend just last week! 

Now for the assholery part, the youngest Sister has been saving up to get Mario kart for the switch and since her birthday was only next month, I planned on surprising her with the game itself. But after yesterday, I feel like cancelling my order. My older Sister instincts say this is too childish but my petty self says screw them they won’t appreciate it.

But this lad, this absolute unit, makes one or two drinks before telling someone to get the rest of her order for her and goes to sit in the back. 

To add on to it, instead of muting her phone at work like a decent human being she keeps it at full blast and just walks to the back to take the call instead of working.

Somehow, I’m seen as the bad guy for splicing some money out of her potential share and splitting it among everyone else.

c1097j	2019-06-15 18:10:21	HaelaDeer	AITA for someone's prom being ruined?	"Ok so I had made plans to go to prom with my friends T, E, and A. E and A were friends, but were going as prom dates.
Then another person, D, asked E to prom. D and E had been friends for a while, and it was no secret that D had feelings for E. E didn't want to reject either of her friends, so she agreed to go as both A's and D's date.
The problem is, D is T's ex. It was not a healthy relationship and they had a really messy breakup leaving T depressed for a few years. T of course didn't want to spend his prom with D, and there was no room in the car for her anyway. A said that D had agreed to come to the dance by her own means and would meet us there, to which T agreed.
Apparently, D was unaware of all this.

So after prom D texted me, saying she didn't want to be friends anymore. I was very confused because I had no idea what she was talking about. D said she had wanted to have dinner with us and take pictures with us etc, and A had decided things without consulting her.
She basically called me stupid for not doubting my friend's words. She was angrier and A and E, and rightly so, since they pretty much excluded her for the whole night. But I don't think it was right of her to be angry at me at all."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c108kb	2019-06-15 18:08:37	PermanentThrow4way	AITA For Ignoring My Friends?	"Hi Reddit! Long-time lurker, first time poster. To save space, I'll add the two in one.

1. A friend of mine, Luke, and I have been friends since high school. Recently, he hasn't been making much of an effort to stay in touch (not responding to messages, never sending messages first) so I've stopped trying.

Recently, he's sent me messages and while I did respond, I didn't put much effort into it. ""Yes"", ""no"", ""haha"" and so on - one word answers.

I asked my step-mom about it and she says I'm being pretty (nice way of saying asshole) but I don't think I am. I got the message before, he's not interested in maintaining the friendship so I'm not going to make an effort.

So, I thought I'd get more than two opinions: Am I The Asshole for ignoring my friend?

2. Another ""friend"" of mine, Caleb, has been very dismissive of any attempt by me to stay in touch. One time at my cousin's birthday party, he actively walked away from me when I tried to talk to him, and when I tried to speak to him at Christmas, he gave very short answers and walked away when I was in the middle of speaking to him.

I ran into him recently and treated him the same way as he treated me - short answers and I walked away shortly after.

My step-brother, who was there, said I was being a dick. I explained the situation to him and he still said I was a dick.

c108if	2019-06-15 18:08:29	icantholdthisin27	AITA for expressing myself when I felt uncomfortable to a friend risking my other friendships?	"I am in an online group of friends who are gaming together for about 2 years now and although it's really dwindled over time there is still a few active members, I will come off completely honest here I've been suffering from severe social anxiety, depression and self-worth issues for almost as far as I can remember and reading this sub and other advice-related sub has really given me a new perspective on how I live my life and how it can affect others around me. Although I am afraid my thinking is too narrow-minded and I sometimes ignore common sense so please give me your honest opinion.

Today we were playing and I was doing decent against 
a friend of mine we'll call her P , I'm 20+ and she is 14 and I'm doing decent against her then this friend who I will call A listened to our conversation talking about how I was winning and started saying ""wow <name> I can't believe you would beat a 14 year old why don't you play with us 1v1 you would rather beat a 14 year old I can't believe it wow <name> beating a 14 year old."" 

I might be iffy with the exact things he said but I specifically remember him saying I beat a 14 year old 3 times which first I just roll my eyes off as bad joke (this friend is usually nice and sometimes comes off as a little strange imo) but by third it just made me uncomfortable and since I didn't used to have much self confidence didn't know what to do and made some other remarks which I cannot remember now but later few moments later I contemplated on sending him text about how I felt but I was afraid he would twist the story when I'm gone and turn my friends (there were 2 other in the voice comms) against me. 

I am not sure if I should feel uncomfortable clouding my thoughts as to maybe I'm just wierd and it's normal to say jokes like that and I was fine to brush off the joke the first time but it just became difficult to play when he kept saying it and I pointed it out to him that I felt uncomfortable it was over the line and just take that into consideration and let's move on to which he replied he hated this kind of stuff and to not talk about it because he moves on quickly which is fine except I said but it made me uncomfortable what of it am I supposed to accept that quietly. I am now very Conflicted over whether I am just butthurt/weird or I was right to do so, also I am afraid he would end up giving me the cold shoulder or turn others against me. Please offer your opinion.



Tldr; friend made inappropriate comments about me beating a minor(not like playing a game) multiple times till it worn off its humor and just made me uncomfortable. Was I correct for pointing that out and potentially risking my friendship."	No A-holes here	0	0

&nbsp;

The other day she had prepared a slow cooker meal before she left for work. She found a recipe online and decided to give it a shot. This was the first time she had ever made this recipe, mind you. I get home late from work so she was already in bed by the time I had my dinner. I was not a fan. There was nothing wrong with the way she prepared it . . . I mean it was a slow cooker recipe. You just throw everything in. It wasn't until the following day that I had mentioned to her that I wasn't a fan of the recipe. I did kind of randomly bring it up as we were chatting about something else, but it had popped into my mind and I wanted to let her know before I forgot again. I had said ""I wasn't a fan of that beef stew recipe. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. You probably shouldn't make it again"". She responded with ""I could have gone my whole life without hearing that"". I responded back with ""I could go my whole life without that recipe"". She said okay, I said okay and we went off to bed. 

&nbsp;

Today her and I are talking about what I said. She told me I hurt her feelings! I told her I don't understand how and that I wasn't criticizing anything that she did. It was literally a dud recipe. Her response to that was ""Well, *I* made it"". I get that . . . and I assured her that I didn't think there was anything wrong with the way that she made it. I just wasn't a fan of the recipe. I'm having a hard time apologizing for her feelings being hurt over a bad recipe that she found on the internet. She's upset about that too.

c105og	2019-06-15 18:01:30	Tenkanmi	WIBTA for telling my friend I don’t want to eat her food because she doesn’t wash her hands?	"Title is pretty self-explanatory. I (25F) slept over one of my close friend’s (25F) home once and noticed that she never washed her hands once leaving the bathroom. Tried casually joking about it like “haha, you’re not going to wash your hands?” And she just laughed it off and kept on her way. 

Naturally, this has put me on edge when it comes to sharing food and stuff. I’m a germaphobe but I think most people who aren’t, would be bothered by this. 

When I’ve come over with our group of friends, I’ve always said okay everyone wash their hands, if we’re cooking together. But I’m not sure if this is something she’d do without us there.

Anyways, the issue is now that sometimes she offers to cook a meal and have us over. I’ve been able to avoid this so far by claiming diets, like Whole30 or saying something like I’m not hungry, I’ll just bring snacks or something. But I know she wants to plan a dinner and I’m not sure how I would get out of it. WIBTA if I told her this? I guess alternatives would be to suck it up and eat or just not go.

EDIT: I didn’t know if this was TMI so I didn’t include at first. But I was also bothered by it, cause she was on her period during this time as well."	Not enough info	0	0

c104xq	2019-06-15 17:59:39	weeeeethrowaway	AITA for refusing to unsubscribe to my brother’s girlfriend’s porn page?	"Throwaway bc some people know my main handle. 

My brother’s gf is on this app where she posts sexual videos and people pay small monthly fee to view her content. She’s not a professional porn star or anything like that. It’s mostly just amateur solo stuff. 

For context, my brother, his current gf and I all went to high school together. But they weren’t dating then or even good friends, and I only knew her casually from my classes. Fast forward and I hear from some mutual acquaintances that this app is how she’s making her money now. I managed to find her page pretty easily and subscribed out of curiosity. I stuck around because it’s pretty good content for the price. I should note that she has like 3k subscribers and I don’t use my real name on there, obviously, so I don’t think she knows I was one of her subs. 

Okay so fast forward some more.  Somehow she and my brother reconnected on instagram or something and eventually they started dating. It’s been a few months now since they’ve been seeing each other but I didn’t realize it was serious at all. 

Anyway last night I stupidly got a little drunk and decided to call my brother and come clean to my brother about the fact that I subscribe to the girl. He already knew what she does and doesn’t care. So my drunken self kind of thought he would laugh the whole thing off...but that did not happen. Apparently he is really committed to her and they’ve even talked about moving in together at some point. 

He asked me to unsubscribe to her page. I was like “yeah ok”. But he didn’t believe I really would so he said he wanted to come to my apartment and literally watch me unsubscribe. That’s when I told him no and he flipped out. 

I said he should just tell his girl to block me if it’s that serious. But he says he’s too embarrassed to even tell her that I’ve watched and asked me not to say anything either. Needless to say, we didn’t end the convo on a great note. 

Knowing my brother he will get over this. But is it that wrong to subscribe to content that’s available to the public anyway? I wouldn’t have subscribed if they had been a couple at the time, but I was already a member *before* they even reconnected. I also already paid for this month so...pretty sure I will have access until at least July even if I unsub.

Edit: Not that it probably makes much difference...But I want to clarify that I don’t *only* subscribe to her."	Asshole	0	0
c104dk	2019-06-15 17:58:14		WIBTA if I stopped reaching out to a friend?	"I’m gonna keep the details vague because I feel like the person I’m talking about probably has found my account somehow and checks it, because I know they do this with other people. 

Anyway, I had a really close friend that I made in high school. We were pretty inseparable for years. As we got older and life goes on we didn’t hang out as much anymore but have always remained friends. No biggie. For the past couple of years they have always taken weeks to respond to texts, which is fine as it’s always just catching up and nothing urgent or anything. People are busy or don’t want to text. That’s fine, I get it. More recently they just don’t even bother responding and a month might go by. Usually I’ll just text again and ask how it’s going, they apologize for not responding, we talk a little, and then I don’t get responded to again. 

It’s getting annoying. We hardly hang out anymore and whenever we do I always feel like it has been me that has to make the plans. I feel like I am always initiating the conversation. The lack of response makes me think that it’s time to just let the friendship die- which is maybe what they’re trying to do anyway. It would be nice if they could just tell me that instead of straight up ghosting me, but whatever. It makes me feel like I did something wrong and I’m constantly thinking back on if I’ve done anything. 

We have been friends for so long and this person really had an impact on my life. I know friendships die and everything but I will feel guilty if I stop reaching out. This person has been through some hard stuff and I don’t think they hang out with anyone besides their SO. And that’s really not a great relationship. 

Part of me wonders if I should just let it die and stop trying, but part of me worries what if they need someone and are going through something tough. I kind of just want to give up but I’m wondering if that makes me a bad person.

Basically my dad and i have been feuding because I started staying at my moms a lot more as its closer to my job and other things. I had previously moved to his house and am a minor so don't have full independence. The longer I stayed at his house our relationship becane toxic. He also was the manager at my previous job too so work was toxic. 

That leads me to recently where I quit my job. On my last day at work he calls me a ""fucking scumbag"" and tells me some other bullshit and genuinely made me afraid that he was going to hurt me at home (He hasn't ever laid a hand on me but my other siblings who are 12 years older than me he used to beat). I then went to his house and gathered my belongings while he was still at work and moved in with my mom. 

Then it took him 3 weeks to even reach out to me or my mom and it was about how he refuses to pay for an MRI and drs apointment I had to have and nothing about how im doing or anything. The thing is is that hes medically responsible for me still as im on his insurance and he writes me off on taxes. He also refuses to pay child support or anything else and my mom and I have decided not to push him on it. 

Now he's lying to all my siblings telling them that hes been calling and texting me about how we need to make up when in reality he hasnt texted or called me once. 

I feel as if im justifiably frustrated and in the right when choosing not to go to the fathers day dinner he invited me too (first text I've gotten from him since this whole ordeal). But everyone else thinks I'm being an asshole for choosing not to go. So AITA or not?

c100ng	2019-06-15 17:48:49	PM_ME_PIKACHU_CUTIE	AITA for telling my dad to shut up while he was screaming at me?	"My dad is one of the most impatient, immature people I know. Often he will go on long rants criticizing me and attacking me, and typically these rants come after things that are out of my control. Yesterday I was taking a shit, and when I came out, he screamed at me profusely for not being there when he needed me for some help. I told him I was in the bathroom and he didn’t tell me about needing help before (I gladly help him with whatever he needs if I’m not taking a shit). He continued to yell at me ad infinitum so I just told him to shut up and went to my room.

Later my mom heard the story and is telling me that although my dad shouldn’t have done that, what I did was way worse because saying “shut up” is showing a lack of respect to my parents. I calmly explained to her that respect is a two way street, and when I am being attacked for things out of my control, I am not being shown respect. She then replied that nobodies perfect, and people get into bad moods. I asked why I remained calm then? “Because you’ve never faced hardship, you have no reason to be angry.”

Here’s the kicker - my dad then said “he sounds like the type of kid that if you hit, he would hit you back.” I was like ??? If you hit me, of course I would hit back! And he laughed as if that was something crazy to say and proved his point that I’m a little shit.

I completely understand that a parent/child relationship is one of power, and the child should obey the parent. But that **power** is the EXACT reason a parent should never verbally harass or hurt their child. Raising your voice now and then is fine, but continually screaming at your kid for taking a shit at an inopportune time *for you* shows an almost childlike self-centered lack of maturity. And if you hit someone — *anyone* — you should be fully expecting a hit back. There is NO relationship on earth where it is ok to hit.

Anyway now they are threatening to not pay for college because I am disobedient and disrespectful, just because of the fact that I will stick up for myself to any authority figure, even my parents. I should note that I have been calm and patient throughout this time, never raising my voice.

Also sorry for the grammatical errors, roast me if you’d like. Originally posted on r/entitledparents but someone told me to post it here too. 

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/c0z9u0/em_gets_mad_when_i_dont_write_her_daughters_essay/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

My sister missed an important event for her physical education class and had to write an essay to make up for it. She plays volleyball and had a two-day tournament the same weekend as her finals. I should mention that she’s injured so she didn’t play: she had all weekend to write her essay.

When they got home from the tournament, my sister said I needed to write her essay for her. I thought she was joking, but she wasn’t.

Later that night, my mother basically demands that I write the essay because my sister has finals to study for. I say no multiple times because it’s cheating.

She gets mad and makes me feel bad for not writing the essay. I tell my sister to write it and I can help her edit it that night. The essay is supposed to be 2 pages, but I told my sister to write as much as she can (at least a page and a half) and I can help her get it up to two pages.

My sister gets mad and says that I won’t even help her and I never do. I don’t say anything and just walk away, because I’m annoyed and upset at them for refusing to see that they’re being unreasonable. 

Later that night, my sister writes the essay and I actually did help her edit it. She wrote a page and a half and I had to fill in the other half page, not too bad. 

A couple days later, my mom and I are in the car and she talks about how I can’t always have a clear vision of what’s right and wrong and have to be a little flexible and bend the rules. She never apologizes for making me feel bad.

c0zw9t	2019-06-15 17:37:52	throwthrowawayy6969	AITA for not wanting to spend time with my SOs family because of how I’ve been treated?	"A little background - My boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 years now. We were long distance for a few years after college and I relocated to a new city to live with him last year. Moving to a new city to be with him means I’m now 7 hours away from my own family. Where we live now is about 30 minutes from his parents/extended family. 

Now, his parents do not like me, especially his mother. My relationship with them started off well and has deteriorated over the past 2 years. I truly cannot understand why as there wasn’t a significant event that happened that would cause this. When I say this to my boyfriend he just says “maybe sometimes you can be abrasive” but isn’t able to ever provide me examples of when I may have acted that way. Having a good relationship with them is important to me and it bothers me a lot that they don’t like me. My boyfriend and I argue about this at least 1-2 times a month so it’s hard on our relationship as well.  

His mother wouldn’t even acknowledge my presence. I would walk in their house after not seeing them for months while he still lived at home and she wouldn’t even say hi. No fake questions like “how is work” or “how is the weather”. She wouldn’t acknowledge I was even there. I have to point this out to my boyfriend so he would finally notice. When he did, he did say something to her so now I at least get a hello. 

I’m usually not invited to family functions. They had a BBQ one weekend but I couldn’t go because it was “family only”. We got into a huge fight and he sided with his family saying “well you’re technically not family” and he left me alone to go home for the BBQ. 

I think I hit my breaking point a few weeks ago. On Mothers Day, when I asked him what we were doing for his mom he said “we’re going to dinner but my mom asked me to only have reservations for 4 people” (to only include his parents, him, and his sister). My boyfriend says that “it’s Mother’s Day and she just wants to spend time with her kids, she gets our undivided attention when it’s just us and you and (his sisters boyfriend) aren’t there” so he never says anything to his parents about it. He has told me that if I have an issue with the way his mom treats me then that’s between them and I have to talk to her. I think that’s isn’t fair at all. The whole situation sucks and really upsets me. My boyfriend doesn’t see why it upsets me so much. He thinks that it’s not a big deal and that I’m dramatic.

She is quite abusive and talks about kicking me out a lot, so I’ve been saving money to move out. My dad lives nearby and I could move to stay with him but at this point I just want to save money and move away completely. I have depression and I just don’t think this place is a good environment for me. 


My boyfriend (together 1 year, known each other and been best friends for longer) lives across the country and offered to share an apartment or room together (roommates). I would much prefer this than moving out completely on my own, but it means moving across the country. I’m perfectly fine with this, however. 


My friends and family that I’ve told have said that I am an asshole for wanting to move away, that family is more important, that I will make my parents upset (I do feel very guilty about this but I really want to get away), things like that. Originally I planned to just not tell them until I left because I didn’t want a fight, which I’ve been told is an asshole move as well. I’m willing to tell them before I move though.

c0zus0	2019-06-15 17:34:02	helpmep73453	AITA For being happy that my ex-wife has moved on	"My current girlfriend, who I truly believe is the right person for me, is upset because she interprets me being happy for my ex as a commitment of emotional energy into my past.

&#x200B;

Some backstory is required and additional context is needed to start, but I really need some outside perspective on this:

My ex-wife and I had been together for 10 years, but only married 1 and a half. The relationship we had was together, but apart, and not one most would deem as healthy. We lived our own separate lives, but would come together at the end of the day to pay bills, plan our future, and make business style decisions. We both realized that we were not as compatible as we had originally thought, we both agreed in a fair, coordinated divorce. There was an idea that we would give it 2 years, see how we had grown, and then decide whether or not to get back together. That's not what happened. I met someone else, told my ex-wife about her while we had finalized the divorce (in my state there is a waiting period) and my ex was happy for me and completely understood that I had moved on.

I thought that I would remain friends with my ex at the time, however my current girlfriend saw me being friends with my ex as me not being over her and trying to incorporate her into the current relationship. I agreed and saw it her way, for how could I grow if I kept around the one responsible for a lot of things I don't like about myself. Also, my current girlfriend is one of those that doesn't like to share her man with other women. And I can understand that. Thus, since the paperwork has been officially processed, I have not spoken to my ex wife.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 2 years and I hear from a mutual friend informs me that my ex-wife is dating someone else. By this point, my current girlfriend and I are very solid. We have not moved in together yet, but are making plans, and I have also become a very prominent figure in her son's life. So upon hearing the news about my ex-wife being in a relationship with someone else, I express that it is great news and that I am happy for her. To be honest, I'm happy for multiple reasons:

1. I am happy that she will not be alone and has found someone that is right for her.
2. I am happy that there is closure regarding the 2 year idea, and since she has now moved on as well, there is no reason to worry about her trying to get back together with me, which isn't really a concern, because I am happy now with what I have.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend is interpreting me being happy for my ex-wife as a sign that I have not gotten over her. She believes I am emotionally investing myself in my ex-wife and see's it as taking away from what we have. She'll ask me, ""Why do you care?"" It has turned into multiple fights and might even be the end of our relationship, as I really feel I am not the asshole here.

&#x200B;

Any feedback would be appreciated...

c0zthp	2019-06-15 17:30:49	Olive-oil-tastes-lik	WIBTA for being upset with my friend for telling people he saw me topless?	"A little bit of context, I’ve been friends with this guy since we were 11 and have no idea when he is claiming he saw me topless. We are all 16 ( Juniors in high school now). 

The other day I went to the mall with one of my friend, K, and we started talking about how are friend, T, who I’ve been friends with for a long time, is bugging her by interfering with her relationship. We go on to gossiping on why this is when she tells me that T told her he saw me topless in a lake when we were kids. 

I found this really odd considering he brought this up the last time we hung out, telling me how it was weird considering I didn’t have a chest at the time.I was kind of weirded out but forgot about it until K brought it up. It made me really uncomfortable that he was telling other people about it, especially since I have no memory of this incident. T also has the tendency to fabricate stories, coming up with outlandish stories about making out with girls in his uncles truck while they’re naked. I was worried that he would take this incident I don’t remember and make it seem like it was a real sexual experience. 

T has also done this kind of thing before, making an encounter of him sharing a blanket with a girl into a story about touching her boob. 

T and I have never been interested in each other. To put it softly I’m just not physically attracted to him, I thought he was someone I could talk to about relationship stuff and he could do the same for me. It makes me pretty uncomfortable that he’s telling other people that this happened and I’m scared he’ll say something about it. 

The other day he asked if K and I were pissed of at him. I told him I was uncomfortable about him telling people about the lake thing. He told me K was asking him weird questions so he brought it up, and since K and I weren’t upset at each other at the time it was okay. I still feel uncomfortable about the situation, but I don’t want to be the asshole by bringing this situation up if it really is nothing, especially since he has low self esteem due to being overweight.

Update: We had a conversation about it and after explaining to him why it was weird he finally apologized! Thanks for all the comments!
Update 2: So according to T the entire conversation started because K said she saw me naked, which never happened. I have no idea who is telling the truth and why they have anything to gain by talking about me naked."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c0zsx4	2019-06-15 17:29:26	troubledlabtech	AITA ? Bf expects me (f) to sign a lease and move to a place when I have no work?	"&#x200B;

My boyfriend is going to graduate school across the country while I am working near my family. We were living within 20 minutes of each other before he got into a graduate program. I told him that I would move out to be with him if I could find work. His lease is up soon and he had coordinated me and several roommates to sign on to a new place. The two of us would be sharing a room together.  I have been unable to find work near him after searching for several months and I do not have the money to wing until I can get a decent job. He is very angry with me that I will not be able to sign the lease and is insistent that I sign and pay regardless of my job status. We have been together for several years and only went long distance a few months ago. I do not feel comfortable putting myself at such a finical risk by taking on a lease with no job.

As a graduate student, his budget is tight and he could not really afford to take on my portion of the lease. I have goals of getting an advanced degree myself and if I don't find something soon I am worried I will be stuck working somewhere for a very short period of time before school, thus not really gaining any new experiences. If I make the move with no job, I will be stuck looking for work only in the area near him, which I have had no luck doing so far. From the start, I have held that I can not sign a lease without employment. I don't really know what to do here and how to come out of this still having a boyfriend. Am I wrong for not wanting to sign the lease?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c0zspc	2019-06-15 17:28:53	NotTodayMyself	AITA for not wanting to help my father?	"  

I’m 24 years old. I live by myself in an apartment just big enough for me and my pets. My father is in his late 40s and has always been involved with drugs. The past years It’s been mostly weed, which I don’t have a problem with, but he’s used heavier drugs in the past. He also drinks.

   
 

My father and I have similar incomes, but my expenses (house, loan etc) are more expensive than his. He always runs out of money 2-3 weeks after payday, which means 1-2 weeks with no money. He definitely spends a good amount on weed and alcohol. When he’s out of money he comes crying to me, begging for me to lend him money over and over again. I do it because I don’t want him to starve because of me. Lending money and getting paid back is okay, but I often have to go out of my way to do it. Meet him, go to the store to pay for him etc. I just wish he could be more careful with his money. 

   
 

I also fairly often give him things (clothes, household things), sometimes because I offer it, sometimes because he goes “can I take this?” when he’s visiting me.

   
 

He also never listens to my advice. He’s about to be kicked out from his apartment and refuses to acknowledge it. I’ve told him time and time again to 1. Talk to his landlord and 2. Look for a new place. He doesn’t wanna do it, he’s sure he’s fine, even though he got a letter about having to go within the end of the month.

   
 

I fear he’ll come to my place and expect to stay, even though he knows I don’t have space for, nor do I want, him to live here. When he is kicked out and tells me he doesn't have anywhere to go, how do I say no to him staying here?

   
 

When I was in my teens he did some harder drugs. I used to find him sleeping on the floor somewhere in the apartment, often in the bathroom. What teenager wants to take a piss with their drugged dad sleeping on the bathroom floor? I often had to wake him up (which wasn’t easy), wrap him in a blanket and lead him to his bed.

   
 

Today is my day off and I planned on spending it relaxing by myself. He called and asked if he could pick up my empty bottles to cash them in, I said it’s fine but I want to be alone, so he can just pick them up. He arrived, he grabbed some juice and food, sat down and started whining to me about everything, and begged for more money. I had to lend him $70 more. He left after 2 hours.

   
 

I just really dislike someone being so dependent on me. And the fact that he keeps whining but never listens to my advice annoys me. It’s sad to say, but these days my father doesn’t give me any happiness. I don’t know, I’ve just grown distant to him. These days I only help him with money and such, that’s about it. We meet fairly often, but I don’t really enjoy it. He also smells a lot of the time as he doesn’t like showering. It’s just generally not pleasant anymore. I wouldn’t exactly cry if we didn’t talk, but I’d feel bad because he’s made it clear he only lives for me. It’s too much pressure, I don’t even wanna live myself sometimes.

c0zs90	2019-06-15 17:27:43	throwaway80800808	AITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want him to go to a bachelor party?	"So, I know how this sounds, but let me explain the whole story.

A few days ago my BF (of 4 years) got an invite to a bachelor party. He lets me know and I think great, a weekend to myself, no big deal.  Well it turns out it's Fourth of July weekend.  This year the 4th falls on a Thursday, and I was able to also get the 5th (Friday) off work so I would have a nice 4 day weekend.

About a month ago I had planned a BBQ for that Saturday (the day of the bachelor party).  I had already invited some of our closer friends (around 15 people), and one of my friends has already switched her weekend at work in order to make it.

The bachelor party is for a family member's wedding that he is in. It is during the day with the option to stay over night.  It's about a 5 hour drive each way from our house, so there's no way to make it to both. It's a combined bachelor/bachelorette party, and BF says I'm invited too, but I haven't heard anything from the bride at all so I really don't think that I am (not that I would be willing to go either way).  He also hasn't had a chance to talk to the bride/groom to confirm this.

We talked about it today, and I basically told him that either way, I would not be attending. I had a long weekend planned, and I don't want him to go either since we have plans already, but in the end it was up to him to make the decision.

I do agree it would be kind of weird for him to not go since he's in the wedding and the rest of the wedding party will be there, but the wedding is still 1.5 years away... there's going to be another bachelor party right before the wedding so I feel like this is just a weird party? I don't know it's all just strange to me.

We already have 8 weddings to go to this summer, he has around 5 bachelor parties to go to (including this one), and I have a couple of bachelorette parties to go to as well.  I just feel like the past 2 years our summers have been consumed by wedding/bachelor/bachelorette parties and bridal/baby showers.  We both work a lot so we don't have whole weekends to ourselves ever, and I was just really looking forward to it.  I told BF I'd like an answer within a few days so I at least know what's going on, and he was fine with that, but I can tell he's a little annoyed, and I feel like an a hole.

&#x200B;

So Reddit am I the asshole?

c0zrgj	2019-06-15 17:25:43	Ella-April	AITA if I don't want to listen to my friend complain about her family issues?	"The title is a little bit misleading.

 Hear me out, I've been friends with (let's call her Amber) her for 2(now 4) years. And during the time we've talk quite a lot. Amber's parents aren't the best people, and she has an autistic(though human calculator) younger brother.

She talks about how her parents call her the ""problem child"" and because she's the oldest, she has to take care of her siblings. 

Not to mention the constant comparisons between her and her MENSA genius cousin.

Also, insomnia. Thankfully she has a doctor aunt who runs a clinic and gives her sleeping pills.

Her parents aren't abusive as starving her or something like that, but her father once slapped her because she couldn't find a toilet for the younger brother on a road trip.
They also like the children more than her and guess why? Because she had no eyebrows. Seriously.

(Also I recently heard her say that her mother maaybe tried to kill her, but she might have been sleep deprived at the time so we'll never know)

Now, I used to listen to it. I would let her talk all day, and she would sometimes cry during her talk. So of course I listened.

But it got tiring when I had to avoid the topic of parents entirely. Say my parents bought me something:
Me: ""Look, I have a new bag!""
Amber: ""...I wish my parents bought me stuff I want.""
And I couldn't say anything else.

All our group of friends can't talk about families if she was near. I feel guilty not letting her in the group chat but we didn't want to make her feel bad.

I've tuned her out when she starts talking about her family. It's all the same thing after all.

This is a story from 2 years ago. She's doing a lot better now because her aunt got suspicious on how her mother was treating her. No, she doesn't suffer from depression if that's what you're asking. Her first boyfriend might have turned out to be her cousin but at least it opened the door to interacting with boys that she was previously disgusted with. I'm not sure if she still talks about her family because we're in different classes now. Well this doesn't matter though.

So Reddit, was I the asshole?

We get on well but she has a drinking problem, that is to say she gets wasted and super dramatic. She will scream in public and cause a scene and argue and all the worst trashy drunk girl things. It always happens where I have to take care of her and make sure some creep doesn’t try to take her home. I told her beforehand I hated it and she promised she wouldn’t get wasted in Amsterdam. She said wanted a brownie and that was it. 

Late yesterday evening I arrive in Amsterdam in the apartment that I purchased for the weekend. She had flown in earlier in the evening. She said she was already at a bar and when I was ready I should go and find her. It happened that I started chatting to a girl on the plane who was having a similar weekend to us and she said she would join us too. 

I get there and she is absolutely WASTED. Her eyes are red and she looks a wreck. She’s sitting with two random men who look dodgy as fuck. She’s screaming and making a scene and the poor girl who has just met her is looking a bit overwhelmed. I apologise and offer to buy her dinner to apologise. But that entire time through dinner,  my friend is getting up and walking in and out of the restaurant. She sits with other people and screams at at them so I have to chase after her. She takes a nap in the back of the restaurant. I’m pissed since it’s my holiday too and she promised she wouldn’t get wasted. It gets a bit much and my first night in Amsterdam is ruined. I get us a taxi home and put her to bed. Luckily the other girl and her acquaintance join us to stay up all night for a girly chat. Their opinion is this friend is taking advantage of me and that I should cut her out my life. 

This morning I wake up at 7 and see she’s awake on the sofa and texting on her phone. I lose my shit and start yelling about her behaviour yesterday. I tell her I’m done with her constantly getting wasted and me having to babysit her. She doesn’t apologise but claims she had only one drink, and the more I question it goes up and up until she admits she had 8 drinks and a brownie. FFS. The fucking lack of accountability. I’m done and I tell her I’m done. 

I tell her to pack her things and GTFO out the apartment. Like now. And she does. She puts on her jacket and packs her bag and leaves. AITA for making her leave an apartment not knowing if she could get anywhere else to stay in a strange city?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I am also gay, and while most of my family is okay with this, there are some who I know have an issue with it (I.e. my grandfather, my mom’s dad, unfriended me on Facebook a while back and still doesn’t acknowledge it to this day). 

All of that being said, I am still a Christian. Maybe not in the “traditional” way, or how most people think I should be, but I still hold fast to most of the beliefs I was raised on. I just happen to have a more tolerant and inclusive mentality when it comes to my religion. 

Jump to today: I got a message from one of my less tolerant family members today, started as the whole pleasantries deal because we haven’t seen each other in a while. Then all of a sudden it turns into this: “Good to hear from you... I am blessed and highly favored. Praise be to God... I'm alive enjoying every min, and so happy now because my life has really changed for better and I was just wondering if you have heard about the good news yet?”

Usually, we all hang out once or twice a week. Most of the time, this happen at our place because our apartment is the most suited to hosting (AKA the biggest one) and everyone can come here easily, we're all in the suburbs of a big European city and some of our friends don't have a car so they're dependent on (very poorly organized) public transportation.  


I'm mostly fine with that and this does come with the perk of asking them to bring food and drinks. So free meal once a week, yeah! But recently I started to notice they're becoming a bit entitled. Like one friend inviting the other at our place before asking us if we can host, or some of them not answering the invitation and dropping by without ever confirming their coming.    


It's nothing major yet, but enough for me to think about politely refusing to host events for a one week or two so that everyone is reminded that our place is not granted. I don't plan on doing it in a confrontational way, but simply saying ""Our place is a mess right now. Let's go out to a bar instead!"" or proposing for them to host the next few time they propose to hang out.   
My SO feels like I'm going a bit too far since nothing major happened and finds it a bit manipulative. I did see the point but would like some exterior and unbiased judgment. WIBTA?

Years ago I started Community College, I paid for it 100% out of pocket. As a result it took me years to go through it. 

About three years ago, I decided I wanted a different direction in life. I went to trade school and became a welder. I put off school and worked for two years. It fucking destroyed me. 70 hour work weeks, one day off every 6-7 weeks, 1st shift one week, 2nd the next. I hated it. Went back to finish my AA. My heart isn’t in it and I’m only a few classes away, but I’m not going to finish. 

I’m just so lost and drifting. I need a way to figure out my life, or if I even want one. I’m planning on leaving and trying to find myself for a few months. But I can’t face anyone. I’m just going to be gone one day. The most I may do is leave a note saying don’t file a missing persons report, I may be back soon. WIBTA?"	Asshole	1	0

My wife recently gave birth to our second kid who is a boy. I was against getting him circumcised but my wife got it done anyway so I took my 3 year old daughter to get circumcised from a guy I know who does it on the downlow 
My wife is furious with me and is threatening divorce, but I said since she got our son cut then our daughter can be cut too. My argument is that since she thinks he doesn't need his foreskin for sex then daughter doesn't need her clitoris and inner labia for sex either"		1	0
c0zhrt	2019-06-15 17:01:28	WineandWeight	AITA for taking a second job under my ex?	"Background on this. Me (27M) and my gf (24F) currently live one state apart because of work. This situation will end in December as her contract will be up and she will be moving back permanently for another job opportunity. Currently I have fallen on to hard times and because of living and housing costs in the area, I need another job. 

&#x200B;

Lets explain where I work without saying exactly where. I work in a very specific job market that is heavily seasonal and times can be lean when you are living alone and in an entry position. So I cannot move as my profession is really planted (Literally) in the area. The town is quite small and everyone knows everyone. I cannot walk down to the local coffee shop without seeing half my ex bosses, ex gfs, or a famous person. My gf met me visiting on a business trip from a neighboring city, so no ties to here. 

&#x200B;

Now back to the story. My ex, whom I mutually broke up with but still are associate friends through business, heard through the networking of friends I was looking for a second job. She calls me and says she can get me a job at one of the businesses she runs. She wont be my direct boss but she still runs the company and I will probably see her once every two weeks. Pay is way better then anything I would get and I would only work till august when busy season starts where I wouldnt need another job. 

&#x200B;

My gf started acting strange when I told her of the opportunity and potential to save some extra money when she returns to our place. She then instead of talking to me over facetime to tell me in person, or as close as you can get in our situation, she texts me and says shes upset I would even think about it. That it feels that I am not considerate with her feelings or I don't care at all. I responded she is getting upset over nothing as I would never cheat and think of my ex as an associate in business. She continues to tell me that I am hurting her and brings up conversations relating to how I want her to be more active and eat better (she hasent eaten the best and her parents have bad habits, and I suggested it to her as a benefit to help depression) and how I am just being different. I just respond saying she is projecting her insecurities on to me and that I am going to take the job as it will help us in the long run. She then stopped talking to me to go to sleep 

&#x200B;

My current job would place me $400 short every month on bills. The second job would put me $900 over. So I could save $900 in the bank to do something special for us when she comes back.

c0zhdd	2019-06-15 17:00:31	chessnbreasts	AITA for having my ‘friends’ ghost on me?	"About a year ago, I had Old middle school friends, well call the Kevin and Malcolm. Malcolm was a competitive dude and Kevin was a gentile giant. We would always get along, always respectful of each other until college.

I was just an insecure 22 year old who wanted to see more of his ‘best friends’. I was a good friend to them, always supplied a bed and food when they needed it.

Around college time, Malcolm took on an arrogant attitude. Was always asking for things but never looking to return the favor. I warned him it would go against his best interest. This attitude evolved and he began to adopt a ‘manly’ mentality. He would use this to his advantage when he needed it, and abandon it when convenient. ‘C’mon man, we’re men now’ was his motto. An example of him using this to his advantage would be playing video games when he wants to and not when I suggest. Or he’ll hit me up to hang and when I say no he’ll say I’m a bitch or I never go out or somewhere new. That I’m a child who doesn’t know best

The real issue was that we didn’t hang out enough, or rather we only hung out when it was convenient for them. They would tell me their plan and I was either a part of it or not, no negotiation, no compromise.It wasn’t always like this. I could hit up Kevin and we would chill, and same with Malcolm. Eventually things changed when Malcolm went to college. Anyway I confronted them with my issue and this is how they responded:

They took me to a restaurant I didn’t want to go to where another friend of mine works. The only reason we know about this restaurant was because of my friend. Had that friend serve us while trying to convince me that I was buggin, that we hang out enough. They tried to convince me things were as they always were, that I’m wrong. After that things went back to ‘normal’ and I’m still not content, I would see them close to 5 time a year at this point! And I didn’t have a say in any of the terms! Needless to say I was pissed, so I came up with a plan to make myself heard, if they cared.

My plan was to call Kevin and make plans the way they make plans. I call him up around midday but his little brother picks up and says he’s sleeping. I tell him to put him on the line anyway, and he does. I believe Kevin was only pretending to be asleep so here’s what I say:

‘Hey you’re free Saturday we’ll chill then’ I say
‘I’m busy Saturday’
‘Sunday then’
‘I’m busy Sunday’
‘What are you doing?’
‘...something in the afternoon’
‘Then the morning, I’ll see you there’
‘...’

He calls me back yelling, buggin. He acts the victim, tellin me I know he can’t go back to sleep once he’s woken up. I say he’s buggin and if he doesn’t want to get blocked he’ll see me on Sunday. He tells me I’m acting childish and he won’t see me. I wait till Sunday to block him.

Then Malcolm texts me. Tells me to unblock Kevin, I say all he’s got to do is hang out with me.  Malcolm says this isn’t how you treat friends, then I tell him this was what I was trying to tell him, that this was how they were treating me, but he didn’t care or buy it. He told me to unblock Kevin or he’s blocking me. No real change for me, so I took him up on it, told him if he ever needs anything I’ll be right here. Haven’t spoken to him since. AITA?"

c0zh9x	2019-06-15 17:00:18	PossibleBird	AITA for taking out my sister's friends but not inviting her or doing the same with her?	"So this may sound childesh, but we're actually in our late 20s.

Now in highschool my sister had two close friends, Amy and Jen.

Now they were her best friends from 11-15 but they lost touch over the years 

I was never close to either of them other than just knowing that they were my sister's friends. I was 4 years older and kinda saw them as kids.

Now last year I ended up hooking up with Amy casually. We were friends with benefits for a few months and as such went out quite a bit, restaurants, parties, drinks and other fun stuff.

Now my sister hadn't seen Amy in years at this point and didn't seem to have much of a problem.

Amy and I are still friends but she started dating a guy and now we rarely see each other.

Jen and I became close over the last few months as we both support the same causes and are members of a charity NGO.

Jen recently just broke up with a her bf of 6 years and a few days ago was her birthday.

I assumed she was hanging out with friends so other than wishing her a happy birthday I didn't have anything planned.

The day after her birthday she told me she spent it alone other than lunch with her family and friend.

I felt really sorry for get and ordered to take her out the following night for a birthday dinner.

So I did, got her a small gift and we spent the night out and of course I paid for everything.

Apparently when my mom told my sister, she went ballistic.

It's true I never take my sister out but I mean come on, I see her all the time. We go out sometimes with my friends. It's not like I totally ignore her or never get her anything.

Also, the night with Jen wasn't a date but it ended up feeling like one as she seems really interested in me since.

So even if it was, my sister can't be jealous of me taking out women who were once get friends.

c0zgs0	2019-06-15 16:59:04	Obnoxiousraver	AITA for refusing to serve mass at my grandma’s funeral?	"My mom recently told me that my grandma wants us (my brothers and l) to serve mass at her funeral. She’s had a stroke recently and now all she talks about is dying and her funeral. I love my grandma. She lives close to us so we hang out with her quite a lot. But the thing is that I’m not religious. I used to serve mass back in grade school because I went to a catholic school and it was just a thing kids there did. When I went to high school I talked to other people about their religious practices, and I noticed that Catholicism was not for me. I am now 22 and am not religious. I am spiritual (I meditate every day), but I am not religious. I haven’t served mass in YEARS and I would have no idea what I would be doing. Not to mention I feel like it would be more meaningful to have someone who actually knows what they are doing and is actually Catholic to serve the mass. It’s not like I would refuse to be at the mass. I’m going to attend, but I just don’t want to serve at the mass. My brothers have a similar point of view because they are no longer Catholic.

c0zg6h	2019-06-15 16:57:33	alpineLotus626	WIBTA if I stick with my plan to move, even though my ex doesn’t want me to?	"The title doesn’t even begin to cover what I’m really asking... I’ll try and make this as concise as possible though. 

So, a couple weeks ago my now-ex sprung on me that he was moving to another town for a better paying job. This was all fine and dandy, we had a bit of an argument about it, but I then managed to also find a job out there, also better paying than my current place of employment.

We were not planning on living together, however his workplace is right next to mine, and I will be living fairly close to his work place as well. 

So a lot of shit went down a couple nights ago, and he made some very poor decisions which ultimately lead to us no longer being together.

He’s leaving on Monday for his new position, and should I still choose to go, I would be leaving in 2 weeks. He texted me to “please don’t come to [town]” to which I responded “I will do whatever I want to do, you made your choices, now you have to live with them”

I know if I go there we are bound to run into each other. He’s apologized for his actions, but I have no interest in forgiving him at this time. And as it stands, if I were to see him, I would pretend like I do not know him, and continue on with my life.

So I guess the big question is, WIBTA if I chose to move there anyways? Even though he doesn’t want me to? I’ve basically already accepted the job offer, people are now counting on me to be there, and I’ve wanted to move away from my current town for a while."	Not the A-hole	0	0

About 4 months ago, I met this amazing woman and we started dating. I had not told her that my ex still had a key to the apartment (my ex now lives in her own apt in a different part of town) so she could visit our cats. This became an issue when my ex stopped over unannounced and came into the apartment surprising my new girlfriend. My gf was so upset I agreed to make my ex ask for permission before visiting. Thats been fine till now but since my divorce is almost finalized, I have been talking to my new girlfriend about us moving in together as soon as my lease is up! I have made it clear that my ex will still be able to visit the cats even after we have a new apartment together (she would not be given a key though). My new gf refuses to consider moving in with me because of this. She suggested that the 3rd cat my ex had just rescued from Brazil before we broke up be given to my ex and I keep the other 2 so that we would both have our own cats and not need what she calls “custody visits”. I refuse to even consider that because the 3 are now bonded and I really like the little guy.

So one day, my dogs (I have 2) get out and to catch them, I hope on my bike and try to chase them. I chase them back home on my bike and hop if it to grab them and put them back inside and it kinda slipped my mind to put my bike back in my shed since I was so exhausted from trying to get my dogs. Fast forward to today (everything previously was yesterday) my dad who just got back from Florida as a traveling nurse who I already a terrible relationship with because of a lot of reasons, come in the house and asks me where my bike is. I get really nervous when he calls or even calls to me because I’m expecting to get just pummeled with insults. I say that it should be in the yard and my dad says that it isn’t there or in the shed. So I go look and I can’t find it around my house anywhere. (Just as a side note, he bought the back for me). After that I come back inside and sit back down since I can’t look for it now since we have to leave for a wedding in an hour and I don’t wanna get dirty. I start just playing my video games again and then he gets pissed. He starts calling me names and is basically calling me worthless which he does a lot. I ask him what he want to do since I can’t go look for it now but he says I know what he wants me to do even thought he never said anything. He is now saying that he is bringing my Xbox and my phone that I’m using to right this back with him to Florida when he goes back to work on Monday unless I find my stolen bike.

c0z8bz	2019-06-15 16:37:04	ahoy_ahole	WIBTA if going on a boat trip meant my ex didn't go	"  

I met my ex right before she moved continents. We got serious over 6 months of LDR. She encouraged me to move and we even got in a fight when she felt like I wasn’t finishing the visa application quickly enough. We both moved to a new city together.

We both decided that since we'd only spent 3 actual weeks together, we should live in different houses, but we found a complex close to both of our jobs and we wound up living in the same complex.

The first night we had the chance to hang out with the big group in the complex, I had been invited earlier by one of the guys. After work I said I wanted to go have a beer while she showered but she got mad I didn’t invite her even though she and the group had just been at her house watching a movie and the party was open-invite. I always felt she was controlling and used fights like this to do so (her ex cheated). I didn’t go and didn't get to meet them to for a little while, but eventually did.

After 6 weeks of being here we broke up. Stressed from work, the move, family stuff and mostly because she was obviously unhappy despite my every effort, it was my mostly my fault. That is no excuse for raising my voice and impatience. My actions are my choice and I take full blame. It lasted for a week and then she came over to talk and we got back together.

We broke up again about 3 weeks ago. No longer consumed with trying to patch things up, I was able to be social. I went out with the group 2 times within those 3 weeks and they were days I knew she was working. There were also a few group messages of planning a day on a boat where I just said I'm in.

One of the guys had a birthday and I said I might stop by. She pms me asking if HAVE to be there ALL THE TIME. Haven't seen her since she broke up with me the second time. After a short exchange, I decide I'll give her space and not go

Today:

We're finalizing plans for the trip in the group chat and I send her a private message saying I'm going and that I would be happy to have a civil conversation if she has a problem. She says I'm being selfish hanging out with her friends and that I tagged along with her to this country and into this group of people and how I'm intruding. I feel she’s changing history because she even said ""I liked having you living so close when we were together, but not now.""

The 2nd time we broke up was amicable. We agreed that we would be cool to see each other. So the birthday party messages and now especially this have me confused.

WIBTA if I went anyway even though she said me being there would ruin her time? I don't want to upset her, but she doesn't control me anymore. I know these people only slightly less well than she does. They're all my neighbors or regular faces. I'm tired of just letting her have her way after fights like I always did, but I also want to know if I AM wrong on this one. This is a bucket list trip.

c0z834	2019-06-15 16:36:27	cohortvertigo	"AITA for telling my friend using the word ""Latinx"" in her article is stupid?"	"So first of all I'm Latina and I hate this term. It's something that was created by white ""woke"" people, not us, it completely goes against the grammatical rules of Spanish, no real Spanish word ends in two consonants, it's barely pronounceable and by extension can create words that aren't at all (for example if ""amigos"" became ""amigxs"") and it's becoming used in contexts where a gender neutral term doesn't even make sense. Just Google ""latinx female"" and see how many hits there are. ""Latina"" could just be used there. I remember my mom asking me about the term when she saw it once and when I told her she said that was one of the stupidest things she's ever heard of in her life.

A friend of mine recently wrote an article for some very indie local publication and asked me what I thought of the first draft. In it she made a reference to a ""predominantly Latinx neighborhood"" in the city and I rolled my eyes. When she asked for feedback i told her ""please don't use this stupid fuckig made up word"", I explained to that it's basically English colonization of the Spanish language and that she could just say ""Hispanic"" in this context (on a side note these terms are not synonyms but a Venn diagram of people in the US would show the vast majority of any who fall in one falling into the other, Latino means ancestry from Latin America. Hispanic means ancestry from a mostly Spanish speaking country. Brazilians are not Hispanic, people from Spain are not Latino, but people with ancestry from Mexico, Central America, South America and Spanish speaking Caribbean islands are both.)

She seemed to be pretty annoyed and then asked why I was so hung up on that and what I thought of the rest of the article. I gave her some other constructive feedback and she thanked me but she still came across a bit cold. Then she asked why I was so hung up on one word she used in the article and I explained it's just a pet peeve of mine.

My wife slept instantly, I took a few extra hours to sleep (at around 6am), sometimes I have insomnia. She woke him up to feed not long after I went to sleep. I was a bit irritated, so I grabbed my pillow and went to the guest bedroom where I slept 4 extra hours.

I woke up and went straight to our room, turned on my desktop PC because I desperately need to work, and she was listening to pop music while calming the baby. I was not on the mood to hear any shit. So I told Alexa to stop playing.

She got irritated, said that’s the only thing she can do while breastfeeding or calming him down. I asked Alexa to turn it back on but she got up and stormed out of the room with the baby.

Half an hour later I went to the kitchen and she was there sulking, browsing Facebook and having breakfast. Just the other day she got super pissed at me for having breakfast without her. I questioned her and she said it’s fine to have breakfast alone. It really is, I just don’t like her having double standards.

So I confronted her a bit and apparently I’m the asshole according to her POV.

I took the baby and I’m looking after him right now while she cooks food. She didn’t ask or anything, she just let the baby sit alone in the stroller at the corner while semi crying, so I just took him along.

Mid spring semester I scored myself an internship that pays minimum wage, not nearly enough to pay bills but I have helped a lot around my house with cleaning. I even helped my father out with meal prepping for his work lunches. 

Because of my internship, I can’t get a traditional job until I complete it. 

Just as I started said internship, my physical health started to deteriorate. I think it’s because of the stress and the amount of work I was doing.

Because of my heath I haven’t been able to clean as much around the house but I still do it out of appreciation of not having to pay rent. The other day I was feeling especially ill and didn’t clean and my father came home and started yelling at me saying he shouldn’t have to carry me. My mom cried then I went back to my room and cried because I feel completely helpless. I’m trying to do well in life but I’m under a lot of pressure and feel crappy 99% of the time due to my illness. 

Today my parents called on a meeting where they pretty much blamed me for the messiness of our home and I told them I’m going to try my best to help more but I literally feel like shit all the time which is why I haven’t been doing the best job.  This escalated to a fight where my dad said I need to get a real job and that I need to be cleaner. 

My mom got emotional again apologizing to me for my dad attacking me and went for a drive. I told her I’m grateful to her being so supportive of me and I’m sorry this turned into a huge thing. I feel really bad about what’s going on and I’m trying hard not to lose my mind. I almost feel like I’d be better off quitting my internship and just working a retail job.

c0z72h	2019-06-15 16:33:51	Poopachoo1231	AITA for not staying the night at my boyfriends after my car got towed?	"So my boyfriend has an ongoing beef with me for not moving in (you can check my post history).  He actually started a fight with me last night about it while I was taking care of him/cooking him dinner (he has a cold).  It was not a pleasant night.

But I ended up staying with him until pretty late to make sure he was ok and my car ended up being towed because my car wasn’t registered to be staying there that late.  Totally my fault for forgetting to move my car.  Since my phone was at 10% and I had no charger and my boyfriend was asleep I just texted him letting him know what happened and Ubered back home (I live 30 min away).

The next morning I wake up to a stream of texts saying I must be cheating because I didn’t just stay the night instead of “being so desperate by paying 30 bucks for an Uber to get somewhere else”.  I tried explaining that I had 10% charge, no charger (bf has a diff type of phone) and didn’t know what else to do so I went home to charge my phone and subsequently made calls to determine where my car was, when I could get it, etc. I told him I was hoping he could help me out getting my car back today by giving me a ride, etc, and then I’d spend the day with him since I’ve pulled him out of a lot of tight spots (eg, drove an hour to give him a ride on a work day, lent him money, pay his rent, etc). He says he has no sympathy for me and why should he emotionally support me if I don’t support him (because I “make him sleep alone”).  He also said I should just keep my distance today because he is so upset with me and he “has no money so can’t help me anyway”?

I see where he is coming from and likely this is carry over from his continuing resentment about me not living there.   So AITA for not just staying the night when my car got towed?  I have no idea how to make it right currently because I feel like he’s being kind of an ass but I also feel like I should just move in to make him happy even though I’m pretty unhappy with the way our relationship is right now?"

c0z45l	2019-06-15 16:26:26	cheapskategirlfriend	AITA for cheaping out on my boyfriend’s toiletries?	"I live with three roommates in a big, expensive city and pay rent myself. My boyfriend lives at home with his parents and helps pay their rent too. I never go over to his home for obvious reasons, but he stays with me almost every weekend. I know this isn’t a lot of time, but we’ve been together 1.5 years and when he stays over, he uses my toiletries.

I don’t make much money, but because I have sensitive skin and hair, I shell out for those products. I’m talking paying $30 for shampoo and conditioner, $20 for body wash, etc...So while it’s definitely not extravagant, it’s a splurge for me. 

Because I already spent money on my own products, I  buy my boyfriend cheap $4 shampoo and $1 soap. I figure since he isn’t around much, it shouldn’t matter. We split the bill on every date night, Uber, food, but I never ask him to pay for toiletries and gladly share the food in my fridge, like yogurts, fruits and waffles, with him without asking him to pay.

He thinks that it’s petty of me to force him to use the cheap stuff and that it means I don’t value him. He says that I’m trying to get back at him for always splitting the bill and for not being invited to his place. I just don’t want to go broke lol.

My family is extremely lovely and give my life for them. 8 months ago my uncle who was a firefighter passed and all responsibilities of the family came upon my father and grandma. 

He left behind my two cousins, one of which is 8 years old. He is extremely cute and my very first brother. I love him a lot, but recently he has started to tick me off. After uncle passed away my father treats him like his own son, everyone in my life makes sure that he won't be left alone after his father's passing. He knows that he gets special treatment and he has started taking advantage of it, acting completely selfishly and entitled. If he won't have something his way he cry like hell and throw everything in the house and even after that if his wish is not granted he will force himself to vomit. One day he went too far. To give some context, I am the type of person who would rather talk something out rather than fight and let my rage take-over it happens very rarely and that day it did. He went to far that day, started throwing in the house and threw my grandma's sandal to my face. My lip got bruised, I still remained patient and tried to calm him but he wouldn't listen one word anyone and I finally snapped and yelled him the worst way possible called him a entitled little kid and told him next time acts like that, I won't just yell at him. I restricted him from playing games on my pc for two days as punishment.


The whole family got mad at me for yelling at him trying to explain me his father is gone and I shouldn't have yelled at like that and he will feel depressed now. I tried explaining my family that with love, I myself feel like I went to far.

Yesterday, I lost my voice and even after a night of rest the highest I can go is a whisper without sounding like a dying goose. I haven't been able to get a day of proper rest since these problems began because I work everyday. 

Today is my cousin's wedding. To say that I've been looking forward to is an understatement. I've been excited for this wedding since they got engaged, and my Mother knows how badly I want to go. The problem is, I don't know how much fun I'd have being in pain and mute at a wedding. As much as I want to go, I know that I'd just have a shit time. Earlier she seemed fine with me not attending, acknowledging how me going would do nothing to improve my health. On my way to visit urgent care to beg for an antibiotic, she seemingly changed her mind after reading webMD and told me I'll be fine if I just keep gargling salt water and taking advil- even though doing so has made me worse.

She's called me selfish for not wanting to go, saying that I can get over it for eight hours and pretend to have a good time. She just texted me saying ""Do what you want I'm sure I will get a ton of crap if you don't show up but that's just the way it is"" which I think is very passive aggressive and has only made me more upset, especially since earlier she said me not showing up would ruin the entire event. I'd love to go to my cousin's wedding but I just can't see how me sucking it up and sitting in the corner for the entire event would be fun. If I'm doing something wrong here, please let me know if AITA.

EDIT: Thank you for all the advice! I talked to my Mom and she was actually very considerate. I'm still going to go, but after the reception I'll go to another cousins hotel room and sleep until the entire event is over, getting the rest I need. Hopefully I won't get too much flack for this!"

c0z2tt	2019-06-15 16:23:12	sogemania64	AITA for choosing a roommate I'd known for two weeks over one I've known for 10 years?	"Back in August of last year I got a new apartment with my s/o and also a new job, to which I was referred by a friend from high school (we'll call him Jacob). Jacob mentioned to me that he wanted to move out of his parents' house by the end of 2018 and since we have a 2br apartment I discussed it with my s/o and we offered him our extra bedroom. 

Around the same time, another of my friends (Mark) had just broken up with his gf and needed a place to stay, so I told that friend that Jacob had already asked to move in, but we could set up a portion of our living room as a temporary situation if Mark couldn't find somewhere else to go. 

After I mentioned to Jacob that Mark might also be moving in, Jacob started to hesitate and said he would wait until Mark had made his decision. For the record, Jacob and Mark have met a few times and don't have any issues with each other. Mark ended up not moving in with me, so I asked Jacob for his final decision. He said that he had found a place with a family friend and was going to move in there. 

A few weeks after Jacob moved in with his friend, he started complaining to me about how much he disliked living with this person because they're messy and lazy and don't bother to do any chores or cleaning in the apartment. Jacob asked again if he could move in with us, so we agreed again. This happened in late March / early April, and Jacob said he was going to wait until mid-May to see if the situation improved.

Mid-May rolls around and a new batch of temp employees started work at the company where my s/o and I work (also with Jacob but he works on a different floor so we don't see him much). One of the temps in my s/o's department mentioned that she needed a place to live and would need to move by the end of May. Meanwhile, Jacob has been putting off his decision and has since told me that he would have a definite answer by the last day of May. Since the temp already had a definite answer, we gave her the room instead of Jacob.

He starts texting me every single freaking day, morning/afternoon/night. I again told
Him I’m not into spending all day texting and that I’m not looking for anything romantic. 

I didn’t hang out with him for almost two months due to schedules. Then today we had plans to go out on his boat today. I went to the grocery store to get beer and subs, and I ask him what he wants. He sends me like 81739 different text messages (all 1 word) about types of beers, ingredients on his sub. How he’s doing low carb again and wouldn’t mind a light beer, maybe even a WhiteClaw.  

Anyway, he forgot to list which cheese he wanted on his sub. I sent him a text asking him, and he takes forever to respond. So I assume he doesn’t want cheese. I mean I don’t fucking know him, I’m not going to pick a cheese he doesn’t fucking like. So I get the sub without cheese. 

I then get another 40 text messages (1-2 words) about which types of cheese he likes. He literally listed every fucking cheese: cheddar, Swiss, Gouda, provolone (best bang for your buck since it’s the most expensive cheese). So I tell him, I’m sorry I didn’t get it with cheese because you didn’t respond. 

As I’m going through the beer aisle, grabbing his freaking low-carb drinks... I realized that I was in an awful mood and that I could not hang out with this dude for 10 hours on a freaking boat. 

So, I texted him and said I had to cancel. 

I’m now sitting on my couch eating my sub, and drinking the beer that I LIKE. I don’t feel like a jerk but my friends think I owe it to him to hang out.

I was tired and had a huge headache so I told them that I was going to take a nap first and we could plan something after. They agreed, so I thought that was the plan, and I went to sleep. 

About an hour and a half later, my brother woke me up to tell me that my friends had shown up to the house and jumped in the pool without telling either of us. (The rest of my family had gone out to eat around the time I went to sleep)

I was upset, but I wasn’t going to make a big deal out of it. I walked into the kitchen, which has a large window with a view of the pool, to grab some chicken to make dinner for my brother and I, as well as to see if my friends really were using my pool without permission. 

They were, so I went back into my room to call my dad to see what I should do about the situation. After about 5 minutes on the phone my brother let me know that they had just left. Keep in mind that they still hadn’t said anything to me. 

Later that night I messaged both of them in a group chat and they both acted like it was no big deal that they came to the pool and didn’t care that I was upset about it. 

So I told them that they need to respect our things and that maybe they shouldn’t come back over for a while and they both messaged back “K.”

c0z1yo	2019-06-15 16:20:57	Zerosugarbeverage	AITA for not wanting to be responsible for my 14 yo sister after my mom goes to prison?	"Some background info. 

I am 25F and live 18 hrs away from my mom and sister. This is the only family I have in this country, the rest of my family lives in South America. 

Several years back, my Mom’s husband started a fraudulent business where they committed some sort of tax fraud. He is in prison and has been for a couple years now. 
My mom was arrested last year in relation to this. And has been out on bail since then but they gave her a date to turn herself in after a court hearing. That date it basically at the end of this month. 

I am not here to argue if my mom is a good person or not. 

We had previously talked because when this happened my mom expected me to take in my sister once she had to turn herself in. I told her I did not feel capable of doing that. I haven’t been in a good emotional place since 2016, and although I am better, I don’t think I could be the best support system for my sister. We agreed to send my sister to our country of origin so she could stay with my grandma or my aunt (they were okay with this). 

Aside from me not feeling capable of properly caring for my sister, I will have to move to my Mom’s city and take care of her car payments, pets, and everything else she is leaving. I was planning on leaving my job to go to a accelerated program in a trade school. I will be taking a loan for this and will be living frugally for years as this program does not allow for a side job. 

My mom basically wants me to postpone my plans and find a new job in her city and basically take care of my sister and her things. She expects this if me and has recently called to tell me that she is disappointed on me for not wanting to do this. She says she cannot take my sister from her environment because it will be bad for her. I don’t think this would be as bad as she thinks. 
(For reference, my mom left my country when I was 12. I lived with my grandma and great grandma until I was 14 when she brought me to the US)

For me it feels like no one is thinking about how this situation is affecting me or what I’m going through. I’m seeing the plans I’ve worked for the last year falling apart and being forced into a role I don’t feel I can fill correctly. I am scared I’m going to be insufficient as a guardian to my sister and I think she would be much better off with my family in our country. I am also scared of my mom resenting me for this.

c0z0yo	2019-06-15 16:18:22	throwawayagbfhdfs	WIBTA if I hid having cosmetic surgery from my dad	"Context: In a few weeks, I'm going to be having rhinoplasty (nose job). I've been unhappy with my nose since I was probably 13-14 years old, maybe even younger, and it has honestly destroyed my self esteem. My nose isn't severely deformed or anything like that - my choice to have surgery is purely cosmetic. I've wanted this most of my life and I'm now 23, so I'm old enough to make this decision. My mom is aware of it and is helping me finance it.

Here is where my dilemma is - I considering going ahead with this surgery without letting my dad know it's happening. I have a good relationship with my dad and I generally try to be honest and open with him about most things. 

My dad is the type of guy who thinks spending money on a haircut is a waste of money because you can just do it yourself. He has always drummed it into me that I should save my money and not ""fritter"" it on material or superficial things. Basically spending money on anything that isn't a necessity is wasteful to him. So the fact that I am spending thousands on cosmetic surgery is definitely something that would not sit well with him.

He also doesn't really understand mental health issues very well. When I've confided in him about my social anxiety in the past, he really can't grasp why I can't ""just stop caring what people think!"" or ""just go outside more!"". The idea of having self confidence issues is just alien to him, like he can't comprehend why someone would care about the way they look. He is from a different generation and had a different upbringing, that's just how it is.

I'm not trying to drag my dad here - he has good intentions and in many ways he is extremely supportive and loving. But there are certain issues I just can't talk to him about. I know that if I told him I was getting surgery, he would absolutely lose it, and the fear of that is what's stopping me from telling him.

But I'm torn about it because deep down I feel like there is something morally wrong about hiding this from him. He is very big on honesty and I worry he would feel like I lied to him when/if he finds out what I've done. This has been on my mind since I had the consultation and I've been going back and forth on whether I should or should not tell him. Now it's getting closer to my surgery and I really don't know what the right thing to do is.

So, with all that being said - WIBTA if I went ahead with my surgery without telling my dad?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I am not judging him, but I very firmly do not want to date someone who has killed someone. 

My bff and her boyfriend are really upset because of the circumstances which he killed people under, because it isn't the same as being a murderer or having a DUI or something, but I'm not comfortable with it in any case, and I don't think I could be good emotional and mental support to someone who has been through this.

This guy is a nice enough guy and is attractive, but I politely declined and said I wasn't looking right now, and my friend's boyfriend told him my reasoning and now he's depressed and upset and they say that's my fault too.

I don't think this is a crazy boundary for me to have. I am not judging him for what he did or why he did it, I just am not the best person to date someone with that experience.

EDIT: No, I am not just assuming he killed people because he was in a combat role. He killed people. His best friend, MY best friend's boyfriend, told me he has, as part of a conversation about wanting to get him to go to a support group that bff's bf goes to for exactly this thing (PTSD from killing in combat).

So I'm driving (male) with my wife in the passengers seat and as I'm half way around a roundabout I spot a car giving way with a young toddler in the back seat on the lap of a woman, who I presume is the mother. I glance again and window is down 3/4 of the way and the child has not only his head out but both arms hanging out of the window.

The car is behind me, going in the same direction and we approach a 2 lane wide road and my wife manages to get a video of them as they speed past (I'm going the limit whilst its common people to go over on this road).

 The woman in the back catches it and tells the driver to slow down and follow us whilst gesturing that they're not happy. I go to a nearby busy petrol station and my wife locks the door whilst I tell the mother to speak to me as she's trying to open the passenger door to hurl abuse.

 All 4 women confront me saying that they're going to call the police saying we've took pictures and the child is going to hospital. (I can assure you they weren't because the nearest hospital which happens to be the childrens' hospital is by far the closest is in the complete *opposite* direction they came from. They were heading towards the shopping centre.)  I told them the kid should be in a seat and after a few heated words one of them kicked my car and they left after taking a picture of my plates.

c0yz93	2019-06-15 16:13:57	FinallyTryingReddit	AITA for blocking my housemates boyfriend from the WIFI?	"Let me first set up the scene before explaining why I'm doing it and what I hope to achieve by doing so.

&#x200B;

So I currently live with my cousin.  Both of us, as well as her boyfriend go to the same university.  I initially lived on campus.  My cousin's former roommate had left and my cousin wanted me to move in with her.  I was aware that she wasn't' the cleanest person around, but I was tired 3 years in a university dorm and not being able to cook for myself.  But boy I didn't realize how bad it was before I moved in.  I was also under the pretense that it would be just me and her, until her boyfriend practically moved in.

Nothing gets cleaned unless I clean it.  The sanitary bin in the bathroom was overflowing with tampons and other goods.  There was grime all over the bath and sink.  The toilet bowl hadn't been cleaned in months.   The floors haven't seen a broom or mop in forever.

&#x200B;

They both neglect all the small things like hanging up the bathroom floor mat to dry for the next person.  That seems small but all these kinds of small things build up really quickly.

&#x200B;

What mostly frustrates me is the kitchen.  Dishes pile up.  Food left in pots and dishes for weeks on end.   I have to hide the few dishes I clean so that  I have something to use since many dishes end up in their room.  It's a small kitchen and I try to keep their mess contained to one side while I keep spot for myself.  I hate cleaning other peoples messes, but when they dirty my spot I just deal with it and clean it.

When they cook they have a ""system"".  He does the cooking, she does the dishes, but obviously that doesn't happen.  I'm a so social mess so confrontations are difficult for me, but I have managed to ask them to two or three times to please clean up behind themselves, but to no avail.

The boyfriend leaves disposables lying around and pretty much follows my cousins behavior.   This where where I get pissed.  How are you going to come in to some one else's home and make a mess?  Leaving shit lying around, not cleaning anything, and using the excuse of my cousin to not doing her part with dishes to not have to deal with a mess you helped create.

I want them to stay at his place more.  They spend most of the day watching Netflix using the boyfriend's laptop.   I have simply blocked the boyfriends Laptop and phone from accessing the WiFi  and I have feign ignorance as to why he cannot connect.  They still have access to internet through my cousin's laptop which is an old painful thing to use, so I'm not completely cutting them off.  This is likely to be enough of an inconvenience for them to start going to his place more. 

For transparency, I game online from time to time .  The constant streaming makes it impossible to do so, so this could seem like me trying to justify my evil.  The main reason for me doing this is because I am fed up with them disrespecting me and showing none of the courtesies I have shown them in regards to cleaning and general considerable actions."

c0yyc5	2019-06-15 16:11:41	heureuseanna	AITA For blocking my ex colleague on Linkedin?	"Before I begin, please excuse my English not being so fluent as it is not my mother tongue.






There is one lady I worked with 5 years ago. We worked together about 6 months and back then she was my onboarding mentor as I was a newbie.






She quit the job as she moved to the states with her husband and I tried to keep in contact with her at least 1-2 times a year. She is nice but not a kind of person who would contact you first and ask how you are doing. Well, she was my mentor so it did not matter anyway, I just wanted to keep in touch with her  because she inspired me a lot in a professional way.





Fast-forward to 2018, I sent her happy birthday message and happy new year message she ignored both messages. In past years I know that she never sends happy b day message back to me but it was okay cause I am that person who remembers everyone’s b day and she is not. However at this point I thought it would be better I just stop contacting her because I don’t hear from her anyway.





6 weeks ago, she called me out of sudden around 9 pm (in CET) and asked me to do reference check for her new job. She apologized that she asks this out of sudden but I already felt in a way... that I am being used. Anyhow, I did it. Two times (for agency company and the company she will work for).
Because that agency company told me I should do both reference check within 12 hours, I spent almost an hour after midnight during the weekday.




I screen captured what I sent them and sent to her saying that I only put really nice words for her. She said thanks.





Last week, I found out on Linkedin she already got that position 4 weeks ago. 





I thought common sense was leaving at least “thank you” or “ hey I got the job” messages for the people who spent times to do a reference check for you but as typical herself, she said nothing.




I thought to myself, holding all disappointment I have had with her, let’s give a last chance by messaging “Hey I saw you got that job! Congrats!” on whatsapp.




Of course she read it soon but never replied. Upon waiting 3 days, I decided that I will block this woman on both whatsapp and linkedin though she has been inspiring me so much because I am not her friend and never will be.




Yesterday I got a contact from our common friend/colleague that I was for sure overreacting and she was so busy that she could not say thank you to me that I should act more like an adult. I told this lady that this is not triggered from one time accident but I am tired of her ignoring my messages all the time but reaching out to me once she needs something. They still think I just feel jealous because she is so doing better than I do in professional life.









TL;DR : An ex colleague who never responds to my messages so only asked for a reference letter and when she got a job she never thanked me. Also when I sent her a congratulations message on WhatsApp she ignored it as well. Now she is blaming me that I am being super immature after I blocked her on both LinkedIn and WhatsApp

Or one time, he gave me something covered in ice cream and told me to eat it, so I did, turns out it was a live bug. Long story short, he messes with me all of the time, he sometimes says the n word too, just to get my reaction when I tell him to stop. I like him, and I don't want to ruin our friendship, so I kind of just sat there and took it for about a year.

That was until this year, this may sound incredibly anti-modest, but there are some people who really look up to me as a good friend, and I like friends, I don't want to lose friends. When I react like a jackass to Jake's crap, it makes me look really bad to other friends who like me for who I am, but I don't want to lose Jake ether. I've been waiting for that moment where I can kind of rise up so I don't look like an idiot, but still keep the friendship with Jake, that's the struggle I'm trying to find the day to react. 

I guess today was that day...he sent me a picture of his middle finger, and that's what started it. Just for the record, Jake HATES being called gay, it's a total insult. He's pretty right-leaning to begin with, and I already have to suppress my sexuality, because he doesn't like anyone that isn't remotely straight. Anyways, I did not want to just sit there and take it, so I told him to stick it up (you know where) and he said he'd do it to me (as a joke, he messes with me) I told him that that was pretty gay, and that's how it happened. He got so mad, it was crazy. I still, don't know if he was joking, but the more he said, the more he got mad and said stuff, the more I found a way to point out how gay it was, until he just left.

I feel bad ether way, because on one hand if he wasn't joking, then I made him really mad, and I don't know if he's my friend anymore :( But on the other hand, if he was joking, he'll still probably continue to mess with me and I'll have to find a new way to slow down the teasing. I'll say, the whole him messing with me, is all my fault, it's me that reacts and continues it, I just don't want him to do something, and me not give a good reaction, and lose his friendship, because that's all that it's built upon.

Was this ""Gay Strategy"" a good approach, or AITA for making him potentially livid?"		1	0
c0yx1y	2019-06-15 16:08:43	LeastAdvertising	AITA for not feeling very bad for my mother’s stress?	"I want to preface this by saying that my mother means more than the world to me.

2 years ago, my mom got pregnant with her 3rd child. I was 18 at the time and my brother was 17. We live in a 3bed room house so I had to move into my brothers room and bunk with him so the baby could have his room. 

Me being in university and my brother being in high school made this extremely difficult because the room wasn’t very big and we had very different schedules, so sleep also was an issue. I eventually moved out to my grandmothers (dads mom) who has 2 guest rooms and a need for someone with technological literacy, so we both benefited there. 

It’s worth mentioning that both my mom and grandma make 6 figures so money isn’t very tight, but neither are swimming in money either.

Anyways, fast forward 2 yrs, the baby is in day care and my mom is back to work, and she’s regularly stressed trying to find sitters when day care is closed, and the 1 month gap between when she went back to work and when the baby was old enough for day care was also brutal, I had to babysit a lot. 

I just can’t find it in me to feel bad for her. She wanted a third child, got pregnant with someone who lives out of the country (my parents separated over 15 years ago) has a child, and then is dying of stress when she has few options to baby sit when she’s not around, or has to lose sleep to baby sit. To me it’s like, you had 2kids before, you know what it’s like. You, for some reason, made that bed for a 3rd time and I can’t find the empathy to feel bad for you when you sleep in it. 

I do my best and help when I can... I don’t leave her high and dry but I’m also working and have university to deal with."	No A-holes here	0	0

c0yuqs	2019-06-15 16:02:57	KarlaGMR	AITA for not visiting my father?	"I stopped seeing my father 4 years ago.

His 1st girlfriend after the divorce was super rude to me, I would talk to her and she would just ignore me, saved some money from my allowance and got her a birthday gift only to find the necklace I gave her in the trash, she would routinely mess up with the plans I had made with my dad and my brother, I tried my best to be polite, clean, helpful etc, my mom urged us to keep in touch with my dad so we used to go every couple of weeks and I came home heart broken because it hurt me so bad that my dad wouldn’t say absolutely anything to her. I was depressed, i dreaded going but i knew my baby brother needed me (she was rude to him as well) until one day I just refused to go, shortly after I stopped visiting my brother stopped going too for obvious reasons.
Years later he broke up with her, I went to visit him a couple of times and my brother went to live with him (I was in college then and living by myself in another city) and then he got girlfriend number two, she was fun and smart and I genuinely liked her and she was ok with me until my dads friends made the joke that they thought my dad was back with my mom because I look so much like her.
Things got so bad that she eventually told me that she didn’t want me to go to her house anymore (my dads house actually, where she wasn’t even living) she would throw away my clothes and little stuff like my shampoo or toothbrush, she used my room as her “closet” and suddenly I had to sleep in the couch because my room was taken etc. I would have been ok with it if she was actually staying there but she wasn’t so this time I told my dad about how it made me feel, how I felt frustrated because I knew he cared more about his girlfriend than me and my dad flipped out and said it wasn’t true so I knew what to do this time, I stopped going. It’s been 4 years since I last saw him, invited him to my college graduation, and he said he couldn’t leave his girlfriend alone and that I was rude for not inviting her, my brother came back to living with my mom soon because of the same issue (he got upset that my dad picked up his gf over us) 
A couple weeks ago my brother called and told me he broke up with her, last week I got a call from my dad asking me to visit him for Father’s Day since my brother isn’t visiting him (he is on his graduation trip) and I just blurted our that I couldn’t because we had plans with my boyfriends father, he seemed sad and I immediately regretted telling him that

I feel like an  asshole for not going to visit him, I feel like I should forgive him for not putting us before his girlfriends before and just start over again, I’m not a child anymore I can be mature about it right? I just don’t want to get my hopes up and then when he gets another girlfriend he won’t even remember me anymore.

I do all the cooking and he has a hot meal at least once a day, and I cook everything from scratch and this can sometimes take a couple of hours a night.

I do the washing up as I go generally and will do clothes washing.

My boyfriend works as a PT and is currently in work about 20 hours a week, over 3 days. 

He gets mad that the house gets messy and that I do probably half as much cleaning total ( probably more Han half tbf, being generous). He goes withdrawn and will barely talk to me and says “I wish you’d help more with cleaning” .

So I guiltily do more and he goes on Xbox while I finish:

Today I got a screenshot from my other friend. In the screenshot my bestie is writing on a Facebook group asking for advice on something pregnancy related (like ""should I do X if I am pregnant""). I am not in this group, but some of my friends are. Many people were congratulating her there (also many people I know), but she didn't answer them yet. So it is not like 100% sure she is pregnant, she didn't really admit it, so maybe the question wasn't about her. I don't know. But she is not really active on FB so even her writing on a page like that is not typical for her.

So I decided to ask her if she is pregnant. I send her a text via WhatsApp and it was maybe a rather blunt question but I just wanted to know the truth. She saw the message but didn't answer. I started to think I was being very rude for asking that. Should I rather pretend I don't know? I honestly don't know ""the etiquette"" for these things as none of my friends have kids yet. 

But I am a bit hurt if she is pregnant and she decides to tell about it to strangers on FB and every other common friend we share there rather than me first. Also why would she assume it stays a secret if she writes about it on a Facebook group when she can clearly see my good friends are also there?

I don't know guys. Maybe she wanted to tell me face to face. I am scared I messed up, AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c0yttv	2019-06-15 16:00:45		AITA for wearing an ahegao hoodie and sweatpants when my friends don't like it?	"To preface this, I'm a college student who bought the infamous ahegao hoodie and sweatpants earlier in the year. I love to wear it around in public because, well, occasionally someone will compliment me, want a picture with me, or just generally think it's savage. I'm not even very fond of hentai, I just wear it ironically because it's savage and madlad-like. You'd be surprised how many compliments it gets me, and besides the two friends I will mention later, only one person I've met told me they disliked it.

&#x200B;

The two friends are both hardcore Christians. I also call myself a Christian, but not as hardcore. Another thing I will say is yeah, I know it's an a-hole move to wear an ahegao hoodie and sweatpants to church, no matter the circumstances. That'll get you excommunicated. Regardless, they don't like me wearing it at all in public. They always say stuff like ""It's not God-honoring"" or ""It's literally censored anime porn"". And I'm like ""Yeah, that's why it's hilarious"" or jokes like ""No, that's my face when I'm looking at some real good pizza"". They also continue with stuff like they think something is wrong with my heart if I keep wearing this. I personally don't think God would kick somebody out of heaven if they like to wear outfits like this. Like, it's just another outfit, and it's definitely not skimpy. It covers my entire body.

We are both the only good students in the class since everybody else just fools around and talks too much. We both get the same grades. We both work hard equally. We are both nice and don't talk in class. However, he seems to give better treatment to her than me. When she says good morning to him, he gives a nice response like, ""Well hello there!"" or ""Good morning. How's your day?"" When I say good morning to him, he just says, ""hey"" in a tone as if he doesn't care. He uses his phone while we work, because we were taught this program on a computer which we always work on, and he doesn't need to actively teach us so he uses his phone. When she asks him a question, he puts down his phone and he walks to her to help her on her computer. When I ask him a question, he stays at his desk and uses his phone, while not even looking at me while he gives his answer. He always praises her and tells her she's doing a good job, and one time, one of my classmates asked him who's his favorite student and he said her name. It's not that I'm mad at her for succeeding because I say ""good job"" to her when she gets good grades in other classes. But I feel that she's getting more special treatment because she's a girl. So AITA if I told him he was being sexist?

c0ys8r	2019-06-15 15:56:41		AITA for “abandoning the family business”?	"My cousin recently started up a lawn care business that he plans on building into a pretty big thing in the next couple years. He has a business degree, and he’s pretty smart on such. He’s building it as a “family business.”He offered me a job soon after telling me about it for pretty much two reasons. The first one being that I’ve recently graduated and can definitely use the extra money. The second one being that I’m in pretty good shape, so I can do whatever job needs to be done without taking much time for breaks (grass cutting, cutting trees and hauling them off, power washing, etc.). The big part of this is my cousin is banking on this business being big enough in a couple years to be living very comfortably. 

Now about a week after I started the job, my buddy and I were at his house playing cards. Naturally, the business and future plans came up. I mentioned that my football coach wants me to go to a very nice college and get an engineering degree because he wants me to have a job that brings in a lot of money. However, I also mentioned that I didn’t have the money for this schooling (even with scholarships), and that I didn’t want to necessarily take that route because I want to go into the military after I get a different degree. 

Well... my cousin only seemed to hear “I’m definitely getting an engineering degree for your business.” Ever since that night all he seems to bring up is how me getting an engineering degree will set us up for life. It’s like he’s making plans for my engineering degree that will never actually come to fruition. He tells everyone in our family that I’m going to help this business so much by doing this. 

I talked to him a few days later about what I wanted for my future, and he made a big fuss about him knowing what’s best for me. He constantly brings it up whenever we’re around other people to try and get them to convince me to forget my goals in life. I’ve had to get pretty stern with him lately because I’m tired of hearing about it. I’m set in my future plans and happy with it 

I’ve told him that I would help out until I graduate college, but he’s making it seem like I’m in the wrong for giving him false hope and abandoning the family business. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c0yqfi	2019-06-15 15:52:01	Jaywearspants	AITA for not wanting to have my parents come hang out at my house all day for fathers day?	"Hey folks. Frequent commenter here but I finally have a story that has me questioning whether IATA or not.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow is Father's day. My first father's day in fact! I'm writing this with my 3 month old asleep right next to me.

Before we had our son we had moved away from our home town area about 3 hours north for 2 years and prior to our wedding decided to move back to our home state to get married and to be closer to family for when we had our first child.  Right after we moved home my parents announced they were moving about 3 hours south, completely negating the distance we tried to make up by moving home (my wife's family is close too, so they weren't the ONLY reason).  My relationship with my parents has never been spectacular but we love each other, just butt heads a lot.  I was heartbroken when they decided to move and tried to convince them otherwise. They wanted to move to a community that does maintenance and whatnot (55+) and have lower taxes, which I get - but I feel like they could have achieved that at least within a bit of a closer distance.  Regardless, we've visited them once since they moved about 1.5 years ago and they've come up here a few times.

This brings me to this weekend. Yesterday, only a few days before fathers day my mom asks me if I want them to come up and we can go out to dinner and celebrate fathers day for me and my dad. I say that'd be great, but our house is a mess so I would prefer not to host them this time, and I had plans this sunday to paint and build a picnic table my wife and I bought recently so I asked if we can just meet at a restaurant to hang out. I figured they then can go hang out at my sisters house or with other family.   


  My mom replied ""fine, just relax then."" and hasn't replied to me since. My dad and I have never really gone crazy for fathers day in the past - and I don't even really know how he feels about this situation, but I plan on calling and talking to him tomorrow to wish him a happy fathers day and chat for a few.

As a side note I kind of get the impression that my parents really just want to take pictures and post them on facebook of our son and that kinda bugs me. We've had the social media talk with my parents and my mom still tends to post things without asking first, and they never seem interested in asking me or my wife about our lives or job - just want to tell us about theirs.

I kinda feel like an asshole. I am not doing anything this weekend really except doing some projects that I've been waiting for a nice weekend to do, but it's my first father's day and I feel like I shouldn't be an asshole for wanting to spend it with just my wife and son. A big part of me is still bitter about their move. It wouldn't be such a challenge to go out for dinner if they lived in town still.

c0ykgq	2019-06-15 15:36:22		AITA for asking (not insisting) to take a family picture with only blood relatives (i.e. not in-laws or adopted children) at our family reunion?	"We are currently at Disneyworld for a family reunion. It’s as fun and cheesy as can be and my mom even had fluorescent pink shirts with out family name and a charicature of my grandparents for all attendees. Our family gets along amazingly well for being so large. I think there’s a total of 78 of us here. Obviously a huge number of those are in-laws but my brother and cousin adopted kids from camboidia and Benin respectively. I adore all my in-laws and my adopted niblings and they are my family. 

An interesting tidbit about my blood family is everyone (and I mean everyone, right down to my cousins 6 month old) either resembles my grandpa or my grandma. It’s so uncanny as to almost be crazy. My mom, aunts and uncles, my cousins, my kids and other grandkids. They either have my grandmas features or my grandpas. 

We were doing family pictures last night on the lawn of the hotel. My grandma hired a professional photographer since it’s the only time all of us have been in one place. We took about a dozen pictures with everyone and they were really fun. 

My cousin and I had the idea that we should sit my grandparents in chairs in front and divide us up into who looks like either grandparent and stand to the side and behind them. Obviously this would be blood relatives only. At first it seemed like everyone was ok with it but then my cousins wife was furious that her adopted children would not be included. I calmly tried to explain to her that we’d just done several with everyone and this pic was sort of just a novelty. My explanation I guess was bad and further alienated more people and everyone left. I didn’t get rhe picture I wanted. 

Well I guess I really offended people because almost everyone went to breakfast and the park without me and my family. I’m very hurt over this because we were having such a good time. Was I the asshole for suggesting this picture?"		1	0

c0yenn	2019-06-15 15:21:08	throwaway_account__1	AITA for taking pics/vids and talking about a guitarist of one of my fave bands at their concert?	"Throwaway bc he follows my real account. Last night my bf and I went to a concert for one of my favorite bands. We got lucky bc right when they were opening the door to the venue we were at the front so of course we went all the way front and center in the crowd. Everything was going great, the opener for the band played and we were both drinking a bit. Then the main band comes on and my bf leaves almost immediately when people start moshing, literally about five minutes in. Important to note: the girls next to me were saying how the guitarist was cute and I laughed along with them, which my bf heard. 

Alone now, I tried to text him all throughout the show to get him to come back/ask what’s wrong. Eventually he said he was up towards the right of the stage but I couldn’t find him. He said he couldn’t find me but I hadn’t moved the entire time and was waving my arms around so he’d see me. Since I was so close I was able to get really good videos of the band, namely the guitarist literally right in front of me. All throughout the show they would ask the crowd questions, and the girls next to me and I thought it would be funny to try to get him to hit the juul. He declined which was totally fine, but I videoed it and put it on my snap story along with other snaps throughout the concert. Afterwards I actually got a chance to talk to him/take a pic with him as he was leaving the stage. 


It was kind of a short set so after their last song I went to go find my bf, he was in the very very back at the bar. He all of a sudden didn’t want to talk to me and asked if I wanted to stay and he would give me money for an Uber home. I said no it’s fine and we left. I was excited to show him all the videos I took since like I said they’re one of my favorite bands. I also showed him the juul video and picture of me meeting the guitarist. Then otw back home he was super quiet and refused to talk to me (which sucked bc we were stuck in traffic for a loooong time). Eventually he said he would tell me what’s going on, but he just dropped me off at my place, and when I asked about it, he said “I just want to go home.” So I respect that, and he didnt text me until this morning telling me what was wrong: He was “really disappointed in me” for “saying with that girl that that guitarist guy was cute and trying to get him to hit your juul, I didn’t expect any of that or know you were like that ig, I wouldn’t have done the same to you.” I’m just really confused and upset about the whole thing."

c0ye12	2019-06-15 15:19:30		AITA for deleting my ex’s friends on social media and causing them to hate me?	"So about 4 years ago, I made friends with other people in college. I met my now ex through them and was introduced into the larger friend group. My city has the largest population of people from their home country living in the US, so the friend network is very large. I genuinely liked everyone and loved hanging out with them, but they would often speak their home language which I did not understand and I was often excluded. Even though I knew everyone, I mostly interacted with the people that were more willing to speak in English. 

When my ex and I broke up, I was heartbroken so I did what at the time I thought was the normal thing to 
 do, which is to purge my social media accounts of my ex. I deleted all the pictures I had of us and all of his friends. I never thought this was a big deal since most of them I would probably never see or speak to again. The only people I did not delete were the friends I was actually close to. 

My ex and I ended up getting back together later. When I saw the people I had deleted a couple of them playfully gave me a hard time for erasing them from my life so I re-friended them and apologized. For me, the whole thing was not a big deal I always thought it is just social media. In the following years, anyone I interacted with I would add back, so now after 4 years I am friends with everyone again. 

So now, this brings me to the present. My ex and I just broke up, and among others, the primary reason for this is because all of his friends and family hate me. All of them have a very negative opinion of me and he feels like he is stuck in the middle. I was completely heartbroken to hear that a group of people I don’t really know can have so much hate towards me. And worst of all, they have hated me for years and he never did anything to change this.

I let my roommates use my tv for the rest of the month on the basis that he would pack it up in its original box(that I’ve kept for a year and half). Lo and behold I get a text from my landlord of all my stuff that I’m storing  in the garage and there is my nice roku tv completely bare with no box and just the original stand sitting on the ground of the garage. Now I’m no expert in electronics but can’t the humidity and temperature of summer damage my tv without a box buffer?

He stays in the garage, not the house, and besides being a fun and nice person, he is  pretty helpful to have around. Some of our neighbors are generally up-to-no-good and he shoes them off the property when we're not home.

It takes nothing from us to let him sleep in a space we don't use. Sharing what I literally never use or need is an absolute no-brainer for me.

So why kick him out?

He and his long-term-off-and-on-lady-friend got in a fight last night (he used to live there, down the street, but she kicked him out. They still hang out sometimes). They're both older, but she's slightly less frail than he is. He says she shoved him first, but she has marks on her face that show he might have hit her hard (he says she fell when they were shoving - classic). I wasn't there, didn't get into the aftermath, and I'll never know what actually happened.

Not not to derail us into some other debate, but I tried imagining ""swapping the genders"" in the situation and that gave some perspective that muddied things for me.

On one hand, I don't want to house someone that might be a threat to my one of my neighbors. On the other, I don't want to kick out someone (who has nobody else) that was maybe possibly just defending himself.

On a few occasions we’ve argued to the point where the relationship almost can’t continue as we find it hard to agree to certain things.

Me and my partner are fairly open with each other , not clingy and let the other do what they want.

However, my partner has recently been speaking to one of her friends (of the other sex), on a daily (constant) basis. We went on a break together and everyday they would message each other, whilst I was doing something else.

The person they have messaged has sent several ‘flirty’ messages (send nudes etc), whilst my partner has said to put them in their place and stopped their advances. I questioned them on this and my partner said if you don’t trust me fully, then this relationship can’t continue. They will almost try to flip the blame and say it’s because I don’t trust them.

Even after this, they still message each other every day, however on Snapchat, where messages disappear. I thought this was a bit suspicious.

I have to travel for a few weeks for work and am very worried about what may happen whilst I’m away. 

Whilst I’m close to just ending it because of all the stress this is causing, I don’t necessarily want to jump the gun as we still have somewhat of a good relationship.

He's a 70yo M, ill refer to as J, I'm a 17yo M. Yesterday J essentially kicked me out of the house because he thought I had been there all day (I hadn't, I went for tocos with the boys and went swimming at 2am because its Arizona). It was the middle of the day so about 108-109° he told me to just leave for like an hour or two. Rightly I'm pissed because no one wants to leave there air conditioned 70° room for the hell scape that is Arizona. 

So I ask him, and later admitted that I crossed a line, if he could slow it on the alcohol, admittedly he had been slowing down but it was still somewhat concerning. He went into a hissy fit and I let myself out when he stormed into the kitchen. 

I called up a friend in the area to see if I could get a ride to his place and we spent the afternoon hangout.

I got back at 11 (because my cars in the shop so my mother had to come get me). Everything was uneventful till this morning. 

He and my mother were talking about it so I get up and walk out to just see and he snaps to me demanding an apology. He and I get into a fight when I refuse to give him an apology. Long story short, my mom left crying and J ""yelled asshole"".

Am I the asshole here?

Edit1 of many I assume: we live in a 1 family house with ample room for everyone. And the reason he kicked me out, as someone made me see in the coments because he asked about it, is because he thinks all I do is sleep. I dont. He keeps saying that its like living with Dracula."	Not enough info	0	0

I’m a transgender woman and a few months ago I emailed him about housing and asked him what the situation was for trans people, he said I would have to room with a man on a male floor something I really didn’t feel comfortable doing. I had lunch the next period after I got the email and I ended up crying in front of all my friends 

I couldn’t find the official policy on the schools website and the housing office was closed for the weekend by the time I called. I spent the weekend super anxious, it was only a couple weeks before the commuting deadline and this was the only school I could afford to go to. I was upset and really annouyed that a large state university was having these troubles, I figured a smaller school might, but this was a large school in a progressive state, this shouldn’t be an issue!

As the night went on I was really freaking out, some of my friends who saw me cry where texting me to see if I was doing better and I ended up calling the sucide hotline, because I felt stuck in this situation

When I called housing on Monday they said the policy was that trans people roomed with their preferred gender.

Throughout the next couple monthes everytime I’ve asked the admissions rep about a trans related issue, he gives me an incorrect answer.

c0yacw	2019-06-15 15:09:58		WIBTA for abandoning my bf to go to a pride block party?	"Me and bf (5 months now) have been rocky for months. Especially last few weeks. My feelings are fading and so are my mental health. I’ve been contemplating leaving. Moving. He knows this. He’s kind and trying to make it work but I just feel like being close friends. I haven’t been able to make any action yet. My therapist told me to try for these two weeks not thinking about us and instead focusing on myself and things I need to get done (get a job, work on my mental). So I have been trying not to think about us or make a decision etc because of her recommendation.  

Tonight is the pride parade. As a pansexual non-binary person this annual event is super important to me and I go yearly. Two friends of mine offered to take me there (and I think take my bf there too. We have no car) and they offered to buy my ticket to the block party after the parade (I’m broke) but they don’t wish to buy his ticket. They were his friends before I started dating him and know he gets self-centered and pissy at times. He’s also not the type to be excited about pride stuff (but the friends are, and I am).  He’s pretty much only going cuz I am and he’s the type to want to glue himself to me (I dislike this). They know he’d probably want to leave before the block party, but they are going to the block party. 

They’re telling me to go with them to the block party after the parade, essentially abandoning my bf and leaving him to find his own ride home. I can’t tell if this is immoral or not. Way I see it, there are two perspectives here:

1) I’d be an asshole for abandoning him and making him find his way him via Uber or something alone. I can’t afford the block party myself, so I should decline friends’ offer and go home with him (he could afford an Uber home, potentially). 

Or

2) it’s no big deal to go to a block party he isn’t interested in. He should let me enjoy myself without making me feel bad about it. If he doesn’t want to go, let me go without guilt. If he surprises us and does want to go, I think he can afford it (he has a job. He affords junk foods and cigarettes all the time I’m sure he can afford this). 

What do you think? I just so easily see him being pissy even just at the parade itself."		1	0

At first, I was going to try to talk to her and find a day I could order tickets and take her out to lunch as well. But, this morning she looked at me and said the first thought she had when she woke up was how I didn't get her anything for mother's day. It completely ruined my mood and now I really dont want to do any of the plans I had. AITA for feeling like that? Also, her birthday is in a month, which I already have a card to give her.

c0y9fe	2019-06-15 15:07:35	EbonyFaery	AITA for not sending my father a Father's Day card or present?	"Background: my dad got custody of me when I was three because my mother was a heroin addict. We moved south and he met another woman, whom I love dearly and I still call Mum. They split up, and he remarried to my now stepmother. They got together when I was 11 and married when I was 14.
All through my childhood my dad would shout a lot, was very controlling, down to picking my clothes out for me, not letting me go out the front of the house to play with friends, etc. Then when he moved in with his now wife I was dropped like a hot potato and had to go and live with my 'mum'. I was in college (UK, so about 16), and on Thursdays I took Russian lessons. The college was near their house so I'd stay there that night but I'd get sandwiches where they'd get a full meal etc, and his wife made it very clear she didn't want me around.
Fast forward to now (I'm 24, 25 this year) and he doesn't bother with me unless I call him. A few weeks ago I called him and he was really shitty with me when he picked up the phone. I was phoning to check his health, he's been having some problems and got test results so I was calling to ask how it had gone but we never even got that far. I hung up after telling him I didn't want to be spoken to like crap, and then I messaged saying I wasn't going to have anything to do with him until he apologised.
Three weeks went by and then, suddenly, yesterday, he messaged me asking if I was sending him a card or going to call him on Father's day. I messaged back saying I would think about it but that he still hadn't apologised for being horrible and the timing of his text was interesting now that he suddenly wanted something from me. It was the same on his birthday this year, he accused me of forgetting when I was a little late due to money troubles, and then he accused me of forgetting last year despite the fact last year I was with him and helped planned and execute a huge party. I got no apology when I pointed that out, either.
This has been going on for 15 years and although I appreciate him taking me away from a woman who was abusing heroin, I don't feel like I've been treated well since. I'm going down to see my 'mum' with my partner next week, and I don't wanna see him. I love him so much and I try so hard and he just takes me for granted. AITA, Reddit ?
TL;DR: dad has always been borderline emotionally abusive. Dropped me out when he remarried. Never calls or texts except when he wants something, in this case, a father's day card and phone call. I don't feel I can keep investing in a one sided relationship. It hurts because I love him but I don't know what to do. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My husband was married to his ex wife 10 years ago. My husband was really young when he got married to her. His ex was 10 years older to him. She ended up kicking him out because he didn't have a good job. They ended up divorcing and she was ordered to pay alimony. They shared joint custody of their daughter for a while. Later, she decided to move away and my husband was awarded custody. 

After that, my husband worked his ass off. He is the proud owner of a very profitable business and he is respected in our community. We got married last year. Last week, I found out that he gifted his ex around a million dollars, because she apparently started asking him for money. She told him that she was really struggling and needed help. So my husband decided to bail her out. He thinks she helped him out by paying alimony ( which was court ordered ). I'll baffled.

I'll call my dog Sunny. Before that my family member took care of Sunny while I was living in a different state for several years. Sunny has always been attached to me because I was their original owner. Now I finally have her back. The family member who took care of Sunny is currently staying with me for a few weeks before moving to a different state. My dog is aging. She gets seizures and is more fragile. I've already taken my dog to the vet and now make home-cooked meals for them. I've also spent hundreds of dollars on different foods, medications and appointments within the last several months.

My family member has not wanted to take any responsibilities for the dog since staying with me. If I've asked them to feed Sunny or take Sunny out, they reply with, ""You need to learn how to prioritize."" That's fine but they also claim ownership of the dog as well because they said they took care of them for several years. So, since they've been staying with me I've taken most responsibilities for caring for Sunny. Even though other family member has more time to do it because they aren't working right now.

  
Today I was preparing dog food and my family member was eating their breakfast. My dog threw up and I know that means that a seizure might be following that. My family member got up to take care of Sunny. I raised my voice and said, ""I've got it! Just go! (As in give me space) I've got it!"" I wanted to make sure Sunny was ok and I've seen her seizures before. My family member really hasn't and I didn't want them doing something to them w/o experience.

&#x200B;

Now my family member is mad. Saying I treated them like they were incompetent. I explained to them that I've taken care of Sunny, and that they recently have not. It's not fair to claim ownership of a pet your hardly take care of. They just reply with, ""I've taken care of the dog for several years while you've been away"" That's their rebuttal always.

I regularly visit him in the dorm about once a week. A while ago a new roomate (I'll call him mike) arrived, my first impression of him is that he seems gay (I kept these thoughts to myself).
One day I was with bf and mike came in, they talked about something and mike said ""oh I didn't give you a hug"" and hugged bf. It seemed kinda strange but I didn't think much of it.
Then on an other day, we came back to the dorm after celebrating bf's birthday and mike hugged bf again, this time a long hug. I did not say anything either.
But then on another occasion bf and I were cooking dinner when mike approached bf and hugged him *from behind* while he was cooking, like those romantic hugs I give him. He then proceeds to say to me ""I am stealing him"" and I awkwardly say ""I do not approve"" and mike says ""I'm not asking you."" I felt upset but I didn't know what to say so I didn't comment.
The next morning I told bf I do not feel comfortable with mike hugging him like that, and he said he'll talk to him. It felt wrong to ask this because bf is straight, I am a female, and we don't know if mike is gay. AITA?

Edit: My specific words were ""I don't feel comfortable with mike hugging you ~from behind~ ""

c0xzgf	2019-06-15 14:40:40	AnnieH_CZ	AITA for expecting my friend to make time for a three-day hang-out?	"I  have a friend who I've been friends with for years. She's 4 years younger than me, I've known her since she was 14 and she's been like a little sister to me. By now she's at university in the same city we live/work and we message daily and extensively.

So, my boyfriend and I spent a part of the last summer visiting some sights in one of the most beautiful parts of our country. When I showed her the pictures, she was speechless. To be fair, the locations are known spots for shooting  various movies and fairy tales, it really is breathtaking. She's never been anywhere near there as it was always too far for her growing up and mentioned she wished she could see that herself. So I figured ""I can arrange that.""

Now, she is very busy, she's always been a workoholic, even as a teen. She's studying two very hard schools, spends a lot of her summer free time supervising kids at camps etc. Knowing how busy her schedule gets, I planned accordingly. I figured I'd pick out the best spots, put it into around 3 hikes/drives, making it like a 3-4 day trip. Transport is not an issue as we have a car to take everyone up there. We have a summer house near the area, there is plenty of beds, kitchen, bathroom, great view, privacy, everything. I told her about all this 6 months ago, saying it'd be me and my boyfriend and her and her boyfriend who we also really like. Potentially we could also take another couple we are friends with to make it a full group hang out. I told her that 6 months early so that she would have plenty of time to count with it in her schedule, my boyfriend and I can adjust our vacation according to her. She loved the idea and said she hopes it'll work out.

Now, about 6 weeks ago I messaged her if she's still counting with the 3 day trip. She said that she is not as she cannot fit it into her schedule and does not have a single free day the whole summer. I honestly find that hard to believe, there are no classes in summer at all here and it's literally just three days in a span of 4 months. So I told her that, that I was disappointed and that she was being kind of a bad friend. She said something in the line of ""look, I had to cut a lot of  other events as well, I just don't have time and capacity to deal with it and had to draw a line between what I'll keep and what I will not, sorry."" I made a snarky comment that I believe it's a matter of priorities. We have not spoken since.

I get that she is busy with all her stuff, but it's just three days, she does not work, so it's not a matter of not having vacation days, she wouldn't spend anything on it either, and considering how long we've been friends with, honestly, she's sometimes more like a sister to me than my actual sister, it's unbelievable to me that she'd just drop it like it's not a big deal at all. Am I the asshole here?  


Edit: 1) uni is free here and so is her living; 2) all agreed to it, only unsure thing was the final date; 3) her summer plans are camps for kids; 4) I support her a lot, e.g. just to help her I got into a long term project she's in where I do most admin work only to ease up her own stuff"		0	0

A couple months ago I was planning a trip with mutual friends to go out of the country and she was invited. At first my spouse wasn't going to go, but then he had decided to go. This was where the problem started. She didn't want him to go because her spouse was out of state. There was other men traveling with us, so it wasn't exclusively a girl's trip and no reason my spouse should have been excluded. At this point in the planning she said she was still ""maybe"" gonna go. 

Now this was a cruise trip that was happening out of state. So we had to catch a flight to board the cruise. We had all discussed that we would catch an early flight to make it in time to board the cruise. However this didn't work for her because she worked overnights. She had told me that I needed to book a flight later in the day, leaving hardly any room to make it onto the cruise ship. She wanted to fly out at 10am. The flight was 3 hours long and another hour bus ride to the ship. We had to be boarded by 2pm. As you can see, this leaves little room for mistakes. Flights being late, the bus being late, traffic, etc.  The whole trip was non refundable and I would not budge on the departure time.  So since I wouldn't book a later flight time she said she was not going.  

She blamed me for all kinds of things. Saying I was a bitch and that I was a selfish person because I ruined her chances of going. That I should reschedule my flight for her and if my spouse wasn't going than I would have. She told my whole family that it was my fault and that I lied to her. Her husband was out of  state for work, and she threw the whole ""I'm lonely and really wanted to go and now it's all your fault.""  It made me feel like a terrible person which is what she was trying to do.

I gave her many options. She could have covered her shift at work. She could have called out. Hell, she could have flew by herself and met us there! We are all adults here. 

Needless to say, she didn't go and it was a nice and relaxing trip.

c0xy3x	2019-06-15 14:36:53	frootbatss	AITA for getting angry?	"Okay, I really hope i could get a respond, first of all, this is my first time doing something like this. Sorry for the shit title btw.

Yesterday evening, i decided to play a couple of games on league with my friends, (there was a person I really cared about who was playing with us, we’ll call him 11, this will be important later). First couple games went smoothly, next couple not so much, i did horrible and everyone assumed i was trolling because of this, i was frustrated and got mad, I know i shouldn’t have but i really didn’t want to play in a specific role so i immediately locked in mid lane which was the lane 11 wanted to play.

That game was horrible to say the least and everyone of my friends got mad at me, especially 11 which really upset me. After the game, I corrected one of my friends on his grammar and received a ‘fuck you’ and him leaving the server. I then got a DM from 11 talking about how selfish and how i didn’t care about him, he told me that i needed to leave him alone for awhile, he then proceeded to unfriended me from EVERYTHING.

I really didn’t want to be labelled as careless to him, i do so much for him, he’s one of the most important people in my life and i don’t want to see him leave because of something i did. 

I’d like to think i wasn’t the asshole in this situation but i’d like more clarification, if i am the asshole how do i fix this, this has happened more than once and all times i’ve had to apologise and write a whole essay length apology.

"I'm a long time classical pianist, and I recently came with the idea of diversifying and starting to play some jazz and blues. I told some friends who also play music and they said they loved it and wanted to join. The drummer also brought a friend of hers to play the guitar. She said he wasn't super good but that he had been really down lately over a break up and being in a new city and needed the outlet. I said ok, cool, and we started debating possible songs.

Turns out the guitarist doesn't like any of the songs we had been discussing. I thought it was whatever and told him to offer some suggestions of songs he knew.

Surprise! He doesn't know a single song. He doesn't know any chords. His complete repertoire is zero. He says he has figured out some parts of some songs by ear, but he won't let us hear it, and turns out it's because he doesn't even have a guitar and will be borrowing the drummer's.

The guy is also really depressed because he's going through a breakup and he has no friends in town and the drummer told me he really needs this. And of course this is just a band for fun, so in theory we're not expecting any level.

But I just want to tell him to get the fuck out and come back when he actually can play something on his instrument."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Every week I have maths tutoring on Saturday and the homework is about give or take 20 pages. This week I had a lot of other school commitments/competitions so I only had 2 days to do the homework. The topic it was on was really hard and I didn't really understand the concept so before the 2 days, I asked my friend if he could help me. He said sure, we'll go to the library after school on Thursday and Friday. Thursday afternoon, I ask him if he's coming and he says ""sorry, boss called me in for work, I'll teach you after I get home"" so I ask him when he gets home and he doesn't reply. I see on his Discord that he's playing video games and I ask him and he says ""I have a day off tomorrow, I'll do the homework and teach you after you finish school on call"". It's important to note:

1. this friend goes to the same tutoring but on Sunday
2. he hasn't done his homework either (has done 0 pages)

I ask another friend for help and she explains it to me but I still only half understand it and she had to go to sleep so I finished everything I could do (\~9 pages). Friday, I come home from school and I ask the dude about it and he says ""lol I was procrastinating and played games, you can have my notes though."" He sends me his notes and stops replying no matter what I send him. I read over them but it's too messy so I ask as many friends as I could about how to do it. Luckily they all replied and I eventually got a somewhat firm grasp on the topic but still wasn't confident but finished most of the homework by 2am. Today (Saturday) I had tutoring and I go shopping with a friend afterwards to relax. I come home and the same guy friend asks me ""can you help me with homework"" and I immediately get kind of salty. I tell him ""just read over your notes, not my fault you procrastinated"" and he gets mad. I end up sending him about 6 pages of my homework and he keeps asking me about my working out. I'm really not in the mood to explain especially after he promised to help me and didn't because he felt like playing games and is now crawling back to me to help him. I stop replying after a while and he curses me out and calls me useless and is never there for him.

Now it's not in our job description to help people unload their cart, but sometimes I'd put things on the belt while I was scanning heavier items. For awhile, I just told this as a general 'shitty customer' story, but being a little older now I wonder if we were both being shitty or if I unintentionally committed a social faux pas by not helping a pregnant customer -- especially when she might've been shitty because of hormones and not indicative of how she was as a person.

&#x200B;

So this time a pregnant lady was coming through with a cart full of various dog foods. So I went out, started scanning the bigger bags with the gun, and then noticed a few of them had an expiration date 15% off sticker which I have to input manually, so as I'm moving back behind the register to start adding the coupon, I asked if she could pull the remaining items out of her cart so I could keep scanning. The remaining items were all canned dog food at the bottom of the cart (maybe 8-15? I don't remember but it wasn't a ton) and this lady did a complete 180. She gets annoyed and starts slamming the cans down on the belt and not saying a word to me while I'm putting in the coupons. I finish scanning things, she pays. As I'm handing her her receipt I ask if she needs help loading things into her car (the store was making us ask everyone this question and, because we were a training store, we had to. It was habit.) she gives me this look and scoffs and says ""no."", then leaves. 

&#x200B;

I think I already know she's a bit of an ass for not just asking me and being passive aggressive, but was this a ""you both suck"" situation because it's assumed that I'd help her? Or because in her mind I ""stopped helping her"" halfway through?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So I had messaged a family member a few days ago asking about what time they'd be up at the cottage for the weekend and then mentioned I was contemplating getting up early to drive in and meet my grandparents for breakfast but that I hadn't messaged/talked to my grandparents about it yet. 

Well I got off work yesterday and was super tired so fell asleep and thus didn't pack anything. I hadn't talked to my grandparents about breakfast or anything at all. 

So I wake up this morning and have a missed call and voicemail asking where I was and that they'd be there (the breakfast place I had mentioned to my cousin) in 15-20 minutes, and then a text sent this morning from my cousin saying they'd also be there.

We have done early breakfast in the past.

TL;DR I didn't make definitive plans with family to meet up but my cousin must've misinterpreted what I meant when I was talking with him and they all made plans for breakfast potentially to specifically meet up with me, that I missed.

Edit: Here's the text to my cousin that was inferred as confirmation I guess.

c0xtrs	2019-06-15 14:25:12	VixHarlow	AITA for Not Helping My Brother with His Forum?	"Little background: I'm the youngest of 4 children. My sister died long before I was born. My two brothers are five and six years older than me, and I was my mother's last ditch attempt to ""replace"" her lost daughter. This has led to a family theory that I am my sister’s reincarnation. My mother started drinking and doing meth when I hit elementary school age. My brothers were both abusive when I was growing up. My dad joined in with the meth addiction and my brothers followed suit at like 14-15 years old. At any given time, I was the only sober one in the house, and my mother and two brothers resented the hell out of me for it.

I was always obsessed with art. However, when I was growing up, whenever I'd try to draw something, my mother's response would always be negative. ""Why are you even trying that? Why are you embarrassing me? You know your brother is the artistic one! Why are you trying to copy him?!"" (Because, apparently, she only had enough artistic skill in her uterus for one child, and I was shaming us all by trying to exist in a way that made me happy) But I conformed, and I stopped trying to create pretty things and just focused on schoolwork.

Until, that is, I got out on my own.

I am still in the process of teaching myself 3D modeling, and I recently started being able to make a little money off of it. Now, this is my pride and fucking joy. It's the one thing in my life that is well and truly mine and I am proud of myself for getting to where I am with it. It’s largely just a private thing that I do for myself, to make myself happy.

I showed my dad, he showed my mom, and days later I had my brother blowing up my phone because he wanted help with a gaming forum that he was trying to put together. A brother, I might add, who I haven't seen in 12 years and who, the last time I spent any real time with him, he told me I needed to lose weight because the only point to a woman's life is to be sexually appealing for men and I'd miss my window if I didn't get my shit together.

(I'm not saying he never improved his view, I don't really know, but I'm saying that it is a serious factor in how I see him and my desire to go out of my way to take over his forum and get it making money just to give it back with no benefit to me.)

Now, I have NO EXPERIENCE IN CREATING, RUNNING, OR ADVERTISING FORUMS. I googled and sent him some links to suggested resources for the avenues that he's trying to go for, but that’s all I felt comfortable doing.

This was deemed unacceptable.

Now, I have my mother sending me nasty emails. My brother seemingly gave up on it, but my mother expects that since I know how to make money online at all, I should know how to help him. She has been using my niece and nephew against me, saying that I am putting my sister's memory to shame, that my art was created out of a spiteful desire to go against her wishes for me, and I should be ashamed because I am a failure as a family member."

My daughter was still young so she stayed with my family in my home town with a promise that when she turned 14 I'd take her on a trip. 

Well 8 yrs goes fast and I am now remarried with a step son that my husband has custody of. We recently relocated for my new job and have mostly depleted the savings. My daughter is now asking about her trip. I asked what she wanted and her only request is to fly on a plane. Unfortunately we now have 5 people in our family and my husband is concerned that it's not fair to exclude my step son (and him). If all four of us go my oldest son is the only one left out. Flights for 5 of us leaves no $ for actually doing much of anything wherever we go. 

My step son (SS) is going to spend some of the summer with him mom and I mentioned that we could take a quick weekend trip just the 3 of us (DH, DD, & I). He is concerned that is still unfair. My thought is that every summer SS takes large vacations with his other family so it's not that big of a deal.

A bit of back story 

So i have been playing playstation with a my friends and this one girl for a while. I play the PlayStation almost every day. So i started playing with this girl (we will call her Z) and we got along really well. Played almost every day on the most romantic game on PlayStation, Rainbow six siege

So i start liking this girl but im not sure if she feels the same way. The only problem for me is that she lives in a different country to me. Now i dont know about everyone else, but long distance kind of puts me off.

So today she says that she has been hiding secret messages in her texts (the texts are snapchat photos so she can make the text any colour or size).

I was surprised and asked her what she was hiding in them. She said she couldn't remember (her lying obviously but in a nice way). Then a couple minutes later i received a photo from her.

So now i was on the look out for messages. Keep in mind that i was in a playstation party with her si we were talking there. After a couple seconds i find the message that i wouldn't have known was there if i wasn't looking for it.

It says that she likes me

Now she is in the party and knows that i have opened the message. She also knows that i found the secret message.

For a few seconds i sit there

And then i say 'oh'.

I then proceeded to keep play siege
She didn't say anything but i think she was really hurt.

Now i dont know what to do because i do like her but i dont know if i can handle the distance

c0xp8l	2019-06-15 14:12:21	Strict_Mastodon	AITA for refusing to wear a wig to my friend’s wedding?	"Just as a little background, I grew up in a very strict Christian family where I wasn’t allowed to cut my hair, ever, because “hair is a woman’s crown”. It was down to my knees by the time I escaped at 18. Ever since then I’ve either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because I cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. So that’s a big reason I’m so stubborn about this issue. Also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. Right now I’m bald because I always shave my head completely for the summer. 

One of my good friends is getting married in August and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. Everything had been cool, she’s always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going Bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if I could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. She explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. I told her I really didn’t want to get a wig, and we’ve been on bad terms ever since.

All of our friends are on her side because “it’s just a wig” and “it’s not like she’s asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she’s not the one being unreasonable.” And I know I can be very stubborn sometimes, which I guess is the reason I’m posting here. 

The thing is, I don’t know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. I’ve already paid for a bridesmaid’s dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who’s going to do our makeup. This wedding has already cost me a fortune. I could afford a wig if I wanted to, but do I really want to spend the money on something I’ll never wear again when I’ve already spent a ton? Not really.

Also, this is going to be on a plantation in Louisiana. In August. I’m already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. 

My biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying I’m the asshole-is the principle of the thing. I feel like it implies I look bad because I don’t have hair, which I personally don’t think is true. Is being bald so hideous I’ll ruin her pictures? Is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? And I think the “I want us to match” thing is stupid. We’re already wearing matching dresses, why isn’t that enough? I know it’s “her day” and we’re supposed to make her happy, but isn’t there a line? 

I’ve offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she’s not having it. I’m still in the bridal party and invited but I don’t know for how much longer, honestly. AITA for not wanting to wear a wig?

EDIT: Just to add two things: 1. She’s not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. Along with the headscarf I’d also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of August so it’d still be really short though."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I'm not all that religious though I'm not an atheist or anything, I was brought up Catholic but don't identify with that church anymore. One of my friends was essentially the same but she started going to a non-denominational church and started getting really into it. Recently 
she mentioned to me that she was being baptized and asked if I wanted to come. I thought that was weird because she was already baptized as a baby, but figured I could see what it was about and support her. I also checked out the church's website, they seemed pretty inoffensive, and according to my friend were pretty awesome and progressive, had open LGBT members, weren't judgmental, didn't care about how you dressed there, etc. so I figured it couldn't be bad.

So I went, and they started off with songs, I actually liked the first one. But then I saw people lifting their hands up in the air and swaying around and thought ""uh this is weird"". Then one of the pastors came up, a young woman wearing a tank top and ripped jeans and was pretty charismatic and likeable, but eventually she also started to make me uncomfortable because she was talking about things like ""Jesus rules all"" and talked about stories of Muslims and other religions becoming Christians and ""choosing Jesus over the world"". Then she introduced the people being baptized today and they all gave a short speech before and most of them just said things about how ""I'm a new person and Jesus saved me!"" I thought even my friend sounded like some brainwashed cult member.

Let me emphasize that I have been to church with my parents many times recently and also went to some weddings, I never got the same type of creepy cult vibes as here. And of course everyone cheered once the people were dunked under water, I thought this would be a solemn and respectful event. There were then some more songs and the same thing of people raising  and stretching out their hands, more cult-like behavior. I actually liked some of the songs, but wow I was uncomfortable.

Once it was all done my friend was excited and thanked me for coming. I was just happy for it to be over. She then went to lunch with me and asked me what I thought. I was trying to keep the topic away but I couldn't so I just said ""OK honestly I thought it was creepy"" and listed the things I thought were odd. My friend seemed pretty annoyed at this and told me how it's so much more progressive than the Catholic church we were raised in, there's married women pastors, and how they support LGBT people and are non-judgemental on sexuality in general. I explained I still couldn't not be uncomfortable at the stuff I saw. I stopped short of telling her I thought it was like a cult though because I knew that would actually offend her. She just went back to talking about how happy she was. I felt a little bad later, this was kind of a special day for her. Should I have just held it in what I thought about it?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c0xnrg	2019-06-15 14:08:15	JenEvans93	WIBTA if I lied about my current job title on my resume?	"So I’ve worked at a company the past year and a half and about 3 months ago they brought in a consultant to help grow the company. Since then, there has been 2 layoffs and the whole company culture (that wasn’t great to begin with) has gone to shit. Many people are leaving and after some choice words from my boss, I’ve decided to start looking as well.

I was first hired as a Marketing Analyst but I only took the job because I was 6 months pregnant and the company that I was a marketing manager for went bankrupt. I started as a Analyst in April 2018. The thing is, last year in August the person managing email was promoted and they asked me to take over. It was “informal” and it didn’t come a raise or official title change because they said there would be a review after 3 months. That review didn’t happen (my boss was fired) but in the last year I’ve more than doubled email revenue, increased open rates by 31% and increased conversion rate to 9.4% (industry average is 3.8%). I do all the campaign planning,  strategy, automation and database cleansing. I work closely with a designer and copy writer and whilst I am not their direct, I’ve helped them with their professional development and managing their priorities. 

During my annual review in April they rejected my request for a job title and raise and said that it’s not been enough time in my role to judge my performance. They said I’m be “entry level in email marketing and that the lack of the experience prevents a raise”. I tried to show my boss my resume (3 years as a marketing manager and 2 years as a marketing consultant) but they said “I can look at your resume but it won’t change anything”. 

I didn’t press it in fear of loosing my job (it was right after a lay-off) but now that I’m trying to leave, the feedback I’m getting is that it looks like I took a demotion (Manager to Analyst) and the title “Marketing Analyst” is too limiting and they are looking for a creative. Would I be an asshole if I lied and said I was an Email Marketing Manager at my current company? Im worried my current bosses will see this on LinkedIn and fire me but at the same time, it would greatly help my search and I want to finally stand up for myself. 

TL;DR my shitty bosses wouldn’t formalize my promotion. Now I’m trying to leave, should I be the asshole if I changed my title on my resume so it shows the role I’ve been doing the past 9 months?"	Asshole	0	0

c0xkvj	2019-06-15 14:00:17	EllyStar	WIBTA if I have no relationship with my stepmom after my dad passes?	"Background: my stepmom is the woman my father cheated on my mother with. She was a family friend, and pretty much watched me and my brothers grow up. When we were late teens/early 20s, my parents split up because of his affair. Obviously this had a lot of nasty and long-lasting repercussions for my family.

That being said, they got married when I was 24.

Further complicating things is the fact that my dad has a degenerative disease, and will probably pass well before she does. She is his caretaker, and I am very grateful for that. For the past 10 years, the length of their marriage, I have always been polite and pleasant, participating in family activities with them, all that good stuff. Never have I been disrespectful. Things are pleasant.

In fact, her mother recently passed, and she referred to me as her daughter multiple times, told me she loved me, and spoke about how she and my father have been working for “10 years to make this a family.“

This caused me to reflect. I don’t want to be her friend. In fact, once my dad passes, I don’t want to have any relationship with her. I’m simply not interested. Too much hurt and pain and history. If I didn’t know her through my dad, she’s not the type of person I would be friends with anyway. 

So what are your thoughts? WIBTA if I had no relationship with her after he goes?  (And to be clear, this wouldn’t be some big dramatic “I’ve hated you all along, you evil witch!” More of a slow drift away...)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c0xi0q	2019-06-15 13:51:50	throwaway_150619	AITA for telling my ex-boyfriend explicitly about a dude I slept with despite knowing it would hurt him?	"Throwaway for privacy reasons - Formatting issues because I'm on mobile.

My ex-boyfriend and I dated for two and a half years. We always had a long-distance relationship and it went pretty well. Unfortunately we both realised that we searched for different things in that relationship: While he is completely fine with long-distance for a couple of years with frequent texting / phone calls and meeting every two to three weeks on the weekend, I decided that I needed a 'finishing date' (moving in the same city or something similar) in order to keep up with the stress etc. Since we figured this out together and also saw that none of us was willing to sacrifice parts of his lifestyle to adapt to the relationship, we decided that we could not maintain the relationship under these circumstances and ended it. The ending happened from both sides and we totally agreed on it. We decided to stay friends and text occasionally and even meet up in a couple of weeks from now. Last weekend I went to a festival, got high and slept with a dude there which I enjoyed. My ex-boyfriend and I decided before the breakup that we would tell each other about new endeavours and so I told him two days ago while we phoned. He asked a lot of specific questions and I always tried to decline and tell him that he doesn't want to know. He kept on asking and after the third time I always answered. Just today I've sent him a picture of my outfit to which he responded that he needs some space for himself, no stories about other dudes and no pictures which I completely understand. My question is now: Am I the asshole for ignoring my gut feeling that he would not take the information well and telling him all the stuff he asked about ?

I'm a 20 year old female college student and my ex-bf is the same age for those who bother."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c0xgph	2019-06-15 13:47:55	Mirai52319	AITA? This is quite some time ago, but have been thinking..	"I have no form of contacting her again unless i make social media accounts but let me tell you...

I had this friend for about 15 years or so. Haven't talked to her in probably more than 2 years. We started talking and being friends in high school. Hung out outside of school not often at all. After high school we probably hung out once every month or a few. It was only for about a couple hours. I didn't have that many friends coming out of HS since most went away but she was one I texted often, saying hey what's up?

So I feel bad because those couple years ago I kind of dropped her from my life. I got a new phone with a new number and just didn't save her number because I didn't feel like she brought that much into my life anymore. The last time I spoke with her I told her I was getting married. Maybe a few other conversations since then. But she doesn't know anything else since then because she doesn't know my new number.

Before I got a new phone there were a few instances where I would go to the park or the store and I would see her and her husband, I would see her see me and then she would turn the other way. So eventually that's why I just didn't care if I were to talk to her again. I just feel bad that I left without letting her know. I don't know where she lives and she doesn't know where I live. But if she really wanted to find me, she knows where my parents live so she could have gone there and asked. Other than me making a social media account and adding her I don't know her number to get ahold of her and ask her how she has been.

Am I the asshole for just leaving her behind without any updates?"	No A-holes here	0	0

"My grandmother has fallen ill and has been ""circling the drain"" (my mother's words) for the last week and a half. I and my siblings and mother have been fortunate enough to take time off of work and act as caregivers to her and sit bedside with her. 

The last two or three days, my grandmother has been mostly sleeping, and hospice has advised that she seems to be nearing ""that time"". In this time, we have been hosting family members from out of town who want to see her and say goodbye, and all sitting in her room in mostly-silence and watching her sleep.

I have a feeling that she will be passing soon, and everyone in my family seems to be under the impression that we will all be sitting with her until her last breath. My mother keeps saying that this is how it was with her grandmother, and her grandmother's grandmother; that everyone just sits around and waits for it to happen. 

I genuinely don't want to experience this.

 I am content knowing that my last moments with my grandmother will likely be me sponging water on her lips, applying her favorite lotion on her hands, and giving her medication to ease her pain. However, everyone including my mother is acting as if me not being there for her in that time is the disrespectful.

c0xc0l	2019-06-15 13:33:26	pornandknowledge	AITA for not being happy on my vacation?	"So I just turned 17, I’m an upcoming senior in high school and I am currently on summer vacation as a little background.

I have traveled a lot with my family and especially my mom growing up and I’ve always enjoyed it. I like going to other places and seeing other cultures and amazing things and all that, but something about this time around is different.

I’m not happy, at all.

This time we went to a place that I’ve never been before, and it hasn’t been all that fun to me and I can’t figure out why.

Maybe I just don’t like the place? It’s nice, but I’m not drawn to it in any specific way.

Maybe I just feel lonely? I find myself more interested in trying to talk to my friends and this girl I’m trying to get with than any of the things we’re doing here. I’ve never felt this way anywhere else we have visited.

Maybe I’m just bored? I love my mom but when you get down to it we don’t have that much in common. We both tend to pretend to take an interest in what we both like but there’s not that much overlap and a lot of this trip has been about me pretending to care about the things she cares about.

In my defense, before we planned this trip I informed her that I didn’t want to travel that much this summer. The summer before your senior year you have a lot of things you have to do to get ready for the College App process and I wanted plenty of time to focus on that and get a job or an internship to have something strong in my App but she really pushed me to come and do this trip with her, and I reluctantly agreed even though I was hesitant from the start. I knew if I said outright “no” that it would upset her.

But through all of this I can’t help but feel guilty. I know I technically told her that I wanted to come and I know the trip was expensive but I haven’t been happy and I can’t tell her that because I fear it’s been weighing on my conscience.

I don’t wanna talk to my friends about it because I don’t wanna come off as an entitled dick or spoiled child.

So I wanted to come here, partially to get this out of my head, but also to see, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I am living on my own and have a full time job and a life outside my family. As I get older I find that there are certain events I just don't enjoy and wish I had never shown up to.

For instance, last Christmas I went to my uncle's house to celebrate. For starters I am not Christian in any way and do not identify with the Christian religion, but they insist we pray every time even though they are really secular. It seems really fake.

They also had no control over their tiny dog who bit me twice while I was trying to get food. Once in the leg and once in the hand, the hand drew blood. Nobody seemed to do anything about the dog the whole time even though others had noticed and commented on it.

Nobody had control of their kids. It was so loud and chaotic with little kids running everywhere and banging toys up and down the stairs. They were always screaming and nobody had them sit down while we were eating.

It was really an unpleasant Christmas. I told my mom that I refuse to go to any holidays at their house and she acted like that wasn't an option.

This isn't an exception for family events either. Things are always too wild for me and I never have a good time.

c0xamn	2019-06-15 13:29:22	mcchknsn9	AITA for my comment to my mom, after being upset she didn't include me?	"My parents live 6 hours away and were in town for a few days this week. Since I work 9-5, and they're staying in an apartment hotel three minutes from my job by car, we talked about meeting up for lunch. I don't have a car.

One thing about my mom is she never wants to come over to my apartment. She always says ""sure we'd love to see your apartment!"" but then she always makes excuses and at the end of the trip she's like, ""well we'll do it next time, sucks that we missed it!!"". She almost never comes over, I'm always inviting them. She always acts like she's in a hurry to leave when she comes over.

Anyway we all met up occasionally but not that often for the first two days. At the end of the second day we were driving with my grandma, and she hadn't seen my new apartment. So I asked if, after the drive, we could see it. Mom says it's too late, that grandma was tired, they'd be in touch tomorrow. I said it'd just be 5 minutes. My grandma stays up super late all the time. I know they wouldn't have minded a drive that long, I know it's just because it's my apartment. She says they'll see tomorrow. I said ""do you promise to come tomorrow then?"" she said they'd ""consider it"" which I know means it won't happen, so I said ""can I please just show you for 5 minutes then now if we don't know if we'll be able to tomorrow?"".

Eventually she caved on going up for a few minutes because she didn't want to promise to come over tomorrow, and my grandma was happy to see it. They were kind of rushed, and my mom said they'd be in touch the next day around lunch.

The next say I text and ask if we could have lunch. I also say I have my grandma's birthday present at home for them to take. My mom says they just ate a ""late breakfast"" at lunch (last time I was invited, this time not). I say ""ok, tell me when you're free, I'd love to see you guys"". Then she says they're free but comes up an excuse why they can't see me. I try to accommodate, so I say I can go whenever, I'll just make up the work that evening, and that I could just follow along. Eventually she says the car is too full, I can't see them, and sends a blurry picture of the extra car seat. She says there's no way I'd fit. It was too blurry and close up to make any judgment but I didn't feel like it was full.

So I just say ok, have a safe trip, etc. but I feel kind of rejected.

Later that night she sends a picture of them in the car driving home and there's an extra person there ??? Like that I know for a fact wasn't with them when I talked to her at noon. I saw the extra person around that time, they were working until 4PM. I think she thinks I was an asshole the day I wanted them to see my apartment, and didn't want to see me and was just making up excuses. So I text her, ""enough space in the car?"". My brother called to tell me I was an asshole, I guess they talked about it. AITA?

"My younger sister is graduating from a very large university this weekend, and thus the ceremony is split into two days: Friday was the general commencement, Saturday (today) is where each college within the university holds their own ceremonies and the diplomas are handed out.

My parents live overseas in S. Korea and flew in a few days ago to the US for her graduation. We all attended the Friday ceremony, including me, and I could tell my parents were pretty mad at me as they seldom talked to me.

The reason is because I told them two weeks ago that I would not be attending the Saturday ceremony as my best friend and I had organized an overnight trip to Death Valley. My best friend is moving to the UK next week for his new job and long story short could only find the time for our trip during my sister's graduation weekend.

My parents were understandably upset when I told them two weeks ago, saying stuff like how I could choose friends over family, but I thought they would eventually cool off before we all got together yesterday, so I was surprised that they didn't.

c0x4n1	2019-06-15 13:10:50	jew-of-the-blade	AITA For sleeping with my ex’s close friend?	"Second time writing this cause you can’t edit titles

So about 3 months ago my ex and I broke up, I thought everything was going great so it hit me pretty hard

After the breakup I stayed close to some of my ex’s friends

One in particular I was really close with, let’s call her Emily

Emily is just a super caring girl, and is easy to open up to, and says she enjoys helping too

And after the breakup with my ex I fell into a deep depression, and if me and Emily were alone, I’d talk to her about it, she always had a good answer to everything I said

About a month ago I became aware that Emily had a bit of a crush on me, I talked to her about it and said that I just wasnt ready for another relationship, I was still insanely in love with my ex and depressed over it

I said the same thing to my ex when she texted me about it, she told me that she was totally okay with it, e.i me and Emily being in a relationship 

And over the past month I’ve just been trying to still get over my ex, I’ve never had someone dwell on me for so long, it’s been bizarre

The fact that me and my ex still kept in regular contact probably didn’t help my situation 

So in early June, my ex texted me to stop talking to Emily about my problems/my ex because it’s stressing her out, I felt like shit.

Since I figured out Emily was interested in me, I started dialing down how much I talked about my ex with her, but after my ex messaged me saying that I just thought it wasn’t enough

I told her that I’d stop talking to Emily after that, for her sake not mine 

And after that I pretty much stopped talking to...everyone

I talked to a select few people I didn’t have any emotional connections with

And the thing that got to me is that no one texted me, no one invited me to anything, now that I wasn’t trying to start conversation it was like no one cared

Everyone except Emily

She’d text me starting conversation, (which I’d keep short out of grief for what I did), or invite me somewhere, which I usually made an excuse for

But after about 2 weeks like that I decided I’d talk to her, and we ended up hanging out again for the first time in a while

It went well, we just talked about how things have been, she started asking why is been so distant, I gave her a watered down version, keeping my ex out of it because I didn’t want to dampen their friendship

But then we kissed, and that escalated all the way to sex

I didn’t plan on it happening, but it did, and we both had a great time

I guess a few of our close friends caught on, which I’m perfectly fine with

But I guess last night someone told my ex

She texted me saying “never talk to me again” and “make Emily happy”

Again I feel awful, I told her that I was gonna leave her alone then 2 weeks later, all this happens

Emily hasn’t woken up yet so I haven’t had a chance to tell her about it, idk if I will

AITA though?


Edit:thank you guys for all the replies, I don’t want to sound like a broken record when replying so sorry if I didn’t reply to yours, but I read through and upvoted all of them, I’m going to a parade today, maybe take my mind off things so I won’t be active for a while, thanks again"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Last night my (F18) boyfriend (M21) and I were on the way home, we passed our local McDonald’s that has a drive thru and we both decided we would stop for food.

My boyfriend was driving and he pulled up into a parking space. Then he asked me to go in and get him his food and bring it out to him. I said to him “if you want to eat in the car then go to the drive thru” 

He refused to go to the drive thru and got mad at me because I wouldn’t walk in and get his food.

I told him I would go in and get the food if we were eating it inside but if we were eating in the car then go through the drive thru.

He lost it and ended up starting the car up and leaving!

Am I the asshole for not going in to get the food?

INFO: When I rang him today and he was being weird with me he asked me to apologise for not getting his food for him. He then said that after him coming over to see me early (8pm) (he normally doesn’t come until around 11/12)  I should have been nice and got him his food.

c0x1xf	2019-06-15 13:02:05	icareaboutdad	AITA for not helping my father pay rent and letting him go homeless?	"My father has been sick with chronic lymes disease for over a decade. He hasn't been able to work for the last 8 or so. He has SSDI disability which gives him $700/m. He also gets foodstamps which is I think 200/m.

I have helped support him and have paid for things like cellphones, phone plan, medications and other misc expenses over the years. For the last few months I have also been paying his gf 300/m for rent.

He is also an alcoholic and spends most of his money on drinking from what I can tell.

He has been living with his longtime girlfriend for this entire time. About a year and a half ago she asked him to move out as she couldn't deal with him anymore. He did look for other places but not very seriously. I tried to help him look and we set up a few viewings but he wasn't able to make it. He said he felt sick or not able to make it. I believe it, as he does semi-regularly have seizures that I've previously witnessed (horrifying).

A few months ago we got in a fight as I again mentioned he should considering stopping or slowing drinking. He then asked me for the 300/m to pay his gf for rent that month and I angrily told him no. I have not talked with him since.

His gf texted me about two months ago saying she couldn't take dealing with him anymore and was going to kick him out. It hurt me a lot but I told her I support her decision and that she should do what is right for her. She then gave him notice to vacate and got a court order to have him leave within 60 days.

He did not find a place until the day before the sheriffs were scheduled to come and remove him. He also lost his phone again during this time and I did talk to his gf about it and shipped him a new one from amazon so he could keep looking. I am also still paying for his phone bill at this point but nothing else.

As he was leaving his gf called me and begged me to give him $500/m so he could pay for a room in a house in town. I said no I can no longer enable him and he needs to figure this out himself. If he is drinking and spending his money on that I cannot help. It was very hard to do.

Now he will likely end up on the street and I do not know how he will survive. I feel that if he ends up dead or hurt I will feel extreme guilt for the rest of my life that I did not do anything to help him. With his seizures I do not think he will do well on the streets.

AITA for not helping support my father with $500/m so he can rent a room somewhere? I am very conflicted but don't want to support him while he is drinking all the time. It is hard because his lymes disease is very severe. He was unable to work due to it even before he became alcoholic. I can understand how someone would turn to drugs if they were left physically disabled and unhappy about their life. He was also a wonderful father and even as an adult he would give me great life advice and was always very supportive of me with my own struggles. It is only in the last maybe five years he's been a real asshole."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I have a somewhat estranged relationship with bio dad & co (when i was young he would always make me feel bad for not visiting ""often enough"" and has always tried to lowkey control me and make me feel bad for not making an effort when he never really made an effort either; learned from example) and I have purposely not reached out to ex step father in 6 months because I realized he is a narcissistic butthead that treated my mom like crap.

She often tells me that I'm a very difficult person to buy things for because I have very specific tastes. I do a lot of research into what I would like for a gift, and for what I give as gifts. She's always amazed at the wonderful ideas I have for gifts, and the gifts I give both her and the kids. When she asks what I want for Christmas or a birthday, I give her very specific examples of what would make a good gift for me.

My ex and I were out and about to eat and enjoy the day, but she had been in a lot of pain since the morning. She self medicates through cannabis as she doesnt want to become dependent on narcotics, but the pain was too much and her method of ingestion had broken.

We went to a smoke shop nearby and got her a replacement for her pot, but decided to get some fast acting CBD from a recommendation by the person working there.

As we were ubering back to our room, she took the CBD out to take a dose. Now im not well versed in the legality of the stuff but from what I could tell it is legal but questionable. I told her its inconsiderate to just pull it out and take it, and she should ask the driver if he minds. She felt I was being rediculous and would be the same as popping a medication pill. I explained that in my view not everyone may see it that way and she should at least ask since its his car.

"She does the laundry and I am grateful for that she is paid pretty decent pay and tbh we've had a good relationship until situations like these ones happen. Yesterday she put a bunch of clothes in the washing machine but God knows why she our a white t-shirt I like with a bunch of yellow green and colorful clothes. Anyways I wake up today she starts with a lie (I had no idea what happened yet). She tells me ""idk what happened to your white t-shirt you must've done something to it before I put it in the washing machine"". I tell her it's okay well figure it out later. 2 hours later I go to check why she said that and I clearly saw what hapenned. My white t-shirt is ruined because of her lazy wash yesterday. Who gives a fuck tho. Its a 30$ puma t-shirt that I liked but it's okay. Just to make sure I go and put it in a nearby dry cleaning place near my house and they tell me we'll try our best but it's ruined because it was washed with colorful clothes. I come back home I'm kinda pissed she's been working as a maid for 6 years at my grandfather's house where I live at with my mum and him (I'm 17 BTW she's 26) anyways I ask her why she did that and she has a nasty habit of lying directly bullshit lies that me n mum are used 2 like oh its not my fault I put it with white clothes only and that's not true anywaysssss. I start talking to her about like why did you do that next time pls don't do that ask mum next time if you don't know and she doesn't answer me, gives me the silent treatment says absolutely nothing no apology and imo she started actin like a real piece of shit. It's a fucking t-shirt who cares there's people dying in the world everyday. The fact that she lied and didn't answer me when I said ""hey next time pls don't do that"" and stuff like that is what got me kinda angry. Because wtf yo like say sorry or atleast say it's my fault ok I wouldve been like no problem. Shes being a dick so i tell her I'm gonna tell grandad to take 30$ of your pay and in 15 days I'm gonna claim that money sorta as a petty revenge for her being a cunt. Like all I wanted was at least the truth or a bullshit apology but she wants to act like the fucking queen after she fucks up my clothes.. Am I the asshole here guys be honest am I being an asshole for wanting to claim that 30$ the t-shirt cost me?"		1	0
c0wtms	2019-06-15 12:34:31		AITA for being nosey about coworkers work habits	Alright so a little background. I work at a government contractored software company as a software engineer. We are also a partial Agile team who use two week sprints for work. We have an internal lab environment for testing, deployment, etc... Some of my work requires assistance from the IT guys (only two of them on my team) to set up some of our machines network and permissions before installing builds. If this doesnt happen beforehand we really cant install anything or test anything until the pre reqs are all there. One of the IT guys, we shall call him Steve, in my opinion is never in the office. The day after he will state at the stand up he in fact did work yesterday but it's usually a status that Steve has used again and again like user support or admin stuff, ok whatever. When Steve is in the office after the stand up, he always says hes busy with something or gotta build a laptop or fix a network. A lot of those things you cant do from home and need to be in the office. Steve will work like 6 hour days too. I'm in the lab a lot so I see when he comes and goes with his bags and everything leaving for the day at 3 pm when he arrived at maybe 10 am. I meanwhile and the rest of the team work 8+. When we need stuff in the lab, Steve cant help us because he wasnt in that day or is too busy and we get pushed back. What I am assuming is Steve is being sly and charging 8 hour days on his time card. I do not believe Steve is actually working from home and is more just chilling at home. How can he fix network stuff or the server room if he is working from home. Someone needs to call him out because it's unfair he is charging time that he isn't actually doing.

c0wtia	2019-06-15 12:34:07		WIBTA if I don't give my neighbor's kid graduation money?	"My son and my neighbor's son both just graduated high school. Our families are not close, but we're neighborly and social.  Neighbor (the mom) called up one day and asked for my parents' (my son's grandparents) address, saying she intended to send them a graduation announcement for her son's graduation.  She was frank that her motivation was the expectation my folks would send money.  

""Please don't do that,"" I said.  ""My parents barely know your son, this doesn't seem right.""

She argued her point, even urging me to have my son send announcements to her family.  I said, ""That's not how we're choosing to do it.  We're just having a small family party, my son doesn't want the attention and doesn't want to send cards/solicitations for money/gifts to everyone under the sun.""  

&#x200B;

This went back & forth for a few minutes, with her continuing to press me for my parents' address and insisting, ""this is how it's done, you need to send cards to lots of people and get a lot of money for your kid.""

&#x200B;

We eventually agreed to disagree and I thought that was the end of it.  Well yesterday a card from her to my son showed up in the mailbox, with fifty bucks in it.  It was a nice gesture and a generous gift (btw my son knows nothing of the above interaction, he was genuinely appreciative of the gift and will send a thank you note)...but I feel she's attempting to manipulate me.  I had not planned to give her son money...but now feel I have to.  It's not the dollar amount at issue here, but the principle of the thing.

Am I a spiteful asshole if I stiff her kid?  Am I a spineless twat if I reciprocate in kind?  I'm stuck."		1	0

I would have greatly preferred a hotel but my mom basically guilted me into staying at thier house because I only see them once a year.

They are cheap and we don't really get along. House temp is set to 85 during the day and they cool it to 80 at night. First night I didn't get a wink of sleep because it was so hot. Next day I went to wal mart and got a cheap fan just to move the air around. It helped but didn't solve the problem. So last night I got up and quietly turned the AC down to 74 after they went to bed. I finally slept


My mom woke up this morning at like 4am and I woke up to her screaming at me that I'm going to ""break"" them and they are on a fixed income. I told her for the love of fuck ""fixed income"" does not mean living off the interest of a multi million dollar stock portfolio. She told me the money needs to last. I told her I'd gladly pay the extra $6 it took to run the AC last night. She told me my bad attitude is one of the reasons we don't get along.

I didn't expect the response to be ""what kind of chauvinistic stunt was that"" 

This genuinely upset be because I didn't do anything with any sort of ulterior motive but just because I'm a dude, I can't seem to do anything classically gentlemanly and pay the bill at a restaurant.

c0wrbk	2019-06-15 12:26:28	matthisonfire	AITA for forcing my cheating ex gf out of a holiday with our group of friends?	"So, a little bit of backstory.

My (19M) gf (18 f) of 6 months left me for his ""best friend"" (the one I had nothing to worry about) after cheating on me and lying for a quite long amount of time.

She was the first person I loved, one month has passed and I realized that no matter what there is no place for a cheater and a liar in my life, not even a small one.

We had a holiday planned togheter in August with our group of friends.

She had been hanging with us 6 months prior of us starting a relationship, while I have been hanging out with this people for years, we grew up togheter, they are almost family to me.

I thought about it for a while, and I realized that I am really not fine with living in the same house with her for one week, I would not be able to enjoy myself and I know it, putting to people in this situation togheter would also create a toxic and embarrassing environment for everybody.

So I talked about this with my friends, they understood my situation and agreed to invite another guy to replace her (so she wouldn't lose any money).

What will happen is that I will offer her an unfair deal: she can either not come, or , if she still want to, I will be the one backing out of the vacation, which I know my friends won't let since they will choose me for many reasons.

I am still pondering if I should go through with this, the reason I think I will is that this situation was not my fault and I don't see why I should suck it up and tolerate her for a week after what she has done.

c0wr44	2019-06-15 12:25:45		AITA for letting a girl cheat on her bf with me?	"Title makes me an obvious a-hole but hear me out.

This happened a few years ago and is just something I can’t seem to get out of my mind.

So a few years ago I (25M) met this girl (24F) when volunteering in Indonesia. We both came around the same time and were scheduled to leave about the same time. Anyway, as soon as I saw her I got sort of a mini crush on her and as time passed that crush developed a lot. So, I did some snooping on Facebook and found out she had a BF. Darn. However, I still liked her and she clearly was intrigued by my character, and we became good friends very quickly. We did romantic things, like, looking at the stars at night and going on walks at the beach etc. However, nothing that would be close to actually cheating. 

After this had gone on for a while she tells me that she isn’t happy with her current boyfriend and that he is both mentally and physically abusive. This sort of removes any sort of barrier I had previously between us. I offer my support... and a few days later we have our first kiss. We both thought it was wrong and stopped. While we didnt do anything intimate after that, we still had a very strong connection and a lot of sexual tension between each other.

We finish our volunteer work and both fly back home. We both live fairly close to each other in Canada and keep seeing each other. After a few weeks of our same old routine of teasing each other she says that she’s fallen in love with me and I tell her that the feeling is mutual. I bring up her boyfriend, and she keeps saying he’s abusive, yet she’s stuck in the relationship and can’t break up with him. I want them to break up so that she can be with me, which is very easy for me to think as I have no emotional connection to her boyfriend. (I realize this seems very childish but I was extremely in love at the time). 

A lot of time passes and she still hasn’t broken up with him. We have a lot of discussion about what she wants. She tells me “I don’t want to lose you”, “you mean the world to me” and a lot of other manipulative cheesy shit. So why doesn’t she break up with her boyfriend? Idk? 

One night she sleeps over at my apartment and things get sort of heated (we’ve slept at each other’s before but we’ve been able to resist having sex for a while) and we have sex. So now she’s officially cheated. We have sex a few more times until she breaks. “You never meant much to me” “I love my boyfriend more than I ever cared about you” “Everytime we had sex I thought about him”  etc .

I figure out that her boyfriend never has ever been abusive in his entire life and is a decent guy. He’s just bad at showing emotions and giving attention, so she got her attention from me instead. She also told him I abused her in order to maintain her relationship

In April this year I was bang out of luck financially and personally so I decided to 180 my life and move to the bush to do teaching on a farm. It's been great and I love the family I'm staying with and money certainly isn't bad, but I miss my hometown horribly today and I've started looking for positions back home.

I feel guilty about doing this because it'll be hard for my employers to find a replacement and they've been nothing but good to me, but I feel like this move might be starting to affect me.

Ok, so here is what happened. I am a 15 year old boy going to high school right now. I have gym every first period. On the first day, I really only had one friend so I hung out with him alot. On the first day we got spilt into groups for a game regarding a basketball. I was unresponsible and overhand threw the basketball at the net. It his the rim and bounced off, and it managed to hit a girl directly in the face. I immediately run over and ask if shes ok, and apologize. I see that she is bleeding out of her nose so I try to walk her to the nurse. Her friend comes up and immediately pushes me. (Her friend is a girl). And she calls me and asshole and forced me to sit out the rest of the game. She was in front of me, so she would have to pass me the ball for me to play. She just passed it to the person behind me.

Fast forward two months. These two girls love volleyball, as do I, and we were playing with a group. Me and her were on opposite sides of the net playing. I got moved up to the front when our frontman served. She immediately spikes it, and I jump up to spike it back. However, I misjudged the distance and rammed into her. I immediately backed up and apologized. This has been after she has been rude to me for a whole semester, doing things like spiking the ball at my head every time I am in front of the net, spreading rumors about me 24/7, and just overall being a jerk. She tells me to come to the net, and when I say no and apologize again she gets underneath the net and walks torward me. I see her hand go back and as it's about to hit my face, I grab it and backhand her. She just looks kinda shocked and walks back to her side of the net. I feel kinda bad about it and I dont know if I am the asshole. 

I know that I'm a boy and shes a girl, but I didnt care at the moment as she has been acting childish no matter how many times I apologize to them for what happened the first day. But I was thinking about it, and I think IATA. Am I?"		0	0

I made a dinner reservation at a nice restaurant, which he knew about.

I told him the discussion was too close to the dinner, but he assured me that he'll make sure to leave such that he'll arrive at the restaurant on time.

He ended up being late for over an hour (!!!), explaining that it was difficult for him to leave the discussion. The issue that the friend wanted to discuss about was husband standing in as a groomsman after another friend pulled out -- not something that I thought couldn't be discussed over a call or something.

Dinner didn't go well. Husband thought I'm a bit mean to get mad at him on his birthday, and for something that ""wasn't in his control'. AITA?

c0widx	2019-06-15 11:54:26	SubstantialAccess0	AITA for not splitting a house sale evenly	"Throwaway because friends know my reddit and this is the kind of family drama they don't really need to know. ANYWAYS, years ago my grandmother passed away. In her will she left the house to my dad, however she had talked to him about this and it was simply so someone had complete control over the property and she didn't trust my uncle with it. My dad agreed that any money made from the sale of the house would be split between my dad and his brother.

&#x200B;

Instead of selling it immediately, they agreed to let my cousin and his new wife move in while they got on their feet. No one really needed the money and this would help them out. My cousin and his wife did sign a contract to live in the house rent free but they had to pay utilities and property tax while there. They lived in the house longer than anticipated, so now the house is the ""cousins"" issue. There are 5 of us, myself and my brother and my uncle's 3 kids. I am technically the one that owns the house.

&#x200B;

We (all 5 of us) have finally agreed its time to sell the house. We got an offer on the house and so I called everyone up so we could have a meeting about it because I want to make sure we all agree with it since it is our house. While talking about this offer it comes out that they think it should be split 20% for everyone. Whereas my brother and I think it should be 50% for my dad's kids and 50% for my uncles kids. And the cousin that lived in the house is saying he should get more because he paid for the utilities and property tax and did upgrades on it so he wants that money back, which I also think is insane because they did all that knowing they were just ""renting"" the house so thats not on us to pay them back for it.

&#x200B;

So anyways they are calling me the asshole and threatening all sorts of things. I've talked to an attorney who looked over everything and he says I am all good and don't have to give them anything (not doing that). But I'm just wondering what you guys think?

He was her friend looong before I met her, but we hit it off & became fast friends. He's tying the knot soon. Poor bastard. (KIDDING!)

His bachelor party is tonight (organized by another friend) and my wife has given me strict instructions that ""if the party decides to go to a strip club....I'm to immediately disband & call her for a ride."" 

I kinda feel like if I ditch the party I'd be an asshole to my/wife's friend. 

Now there's NO GUARANTEE that we'll even go to a strip club. The plan is just to meet at his house & UBER out & go bar hopping. My wife's concern is once we get some drinks in us (and being that is is a bachelor party) we will inevitably wind up at a strip club. 

Cliché...I know.

I've got zero history of infidelity with the misses, so it's not as if I'm a serial cheater or some shit. My wife sees strip clubs as ""places filled with whores & guys looking to get their dicks wet"". 

I'm 36 years old & honestly have never been. I've been with my wife since I was 20 years old.

So WIBTA if the party does go to a strip club & I don't bail? I don't wanna be a dick to my/wife's buddy on HIS night & TBH I think my wife's kind of being unreasonable, especially since this is her friend too & she's the only reason me and him even know each other.



*UPDATE: We went to a cigar/cocktail lounge. Then went to a comedy club, then I called my wife to pick me up because the guy who was hosting the party wanted me to get an UBER to a strip club.

We were all pretty lit at that point & apparently no one charges thier phones before going out except me, LoL.

I did order their Uber, but made up an excuse about drinking to much & not wanting to puke on some poor girls boobies."	Asshole	0	0

I couldn’t do it anymore. My aunt has a mental disorder and has had a very difficult life that was filled with abuse. I understand that, but I don’t understand how that can be used as an excuse for her rude behaviour. She has constantly insulted my sister and I, telling us how ugly we look, how stupid we are. She even dishes out personal insults, like how my sister will never have children (not true, she just knows how badly my sister wants them), how she has my dad’s nose, how bad my hair is (it isn’t), all of these dumb fucking things. 

Yesterday, she came to visit and insulted my uncle behind his back, and said that he’s slow and retarded and that his children are ashamed of him. She told all of this to the cleaner, A COMPLETE STRANGER who has no right to know any of our family’s business. I saw red and told her that she shouldn’t be speaking about others behind their backs, and that I have quite a few things to say about her. She raised her voice and said, “Now say it! Say it!” but I refused. My mom was really upset with me, and we got into an argument about how disrespectful that was. 

She’s also exceptionally nosy and when she comes to visit she always goes into all of our rooms and checks everything out. What the fuck?! 

Despite her past and mental disorder, I still feel a great deal of resentment towards her, and I hate that no one wants to say anything to her bc she’ll get upset. Someone needs to set her straight and it sucks that I’m constantly being put in this position.

At the end I asked Lia if we’re good, and she replied, we’re good. This week I realized that I had been sending Lia lots over social media and she’s MIA. I decided to text her to say hi. After a while of no response, I texted that it’s been a while since we’ve spoken and we used to talk a lot. She replied saying good luck on exams. I asked, “our relationship seems off, what do u think?”

Well, that pissed her off. She responded 2 days later saying that she’s still upset from the previous argument. I reminded her that she said “we’re good” and she said I should know to give her time to recover, that’s what people naturally do. She was annoyed that I asked her twice if we’re okay and would have preferred some nice conversation about life to just get over it, and I pushed it. We’ve been friends for 4 years, I thought I could just be honest to her and if she had a problem, she should’ve just told me or said “I’m busy, let’s talk about this later.” She told me I should’ve known that “good luck on finals” means we’re okay and she also didn’t like my question (our relationship seems off, what do u think?), so she put it off for a few days and I need to get over it.

I feel like our convo was very one sided. She keeps telling me to get over it and she ignored me because she was annoyed, and I should just know and move on. Then again, what if I’m wrong, I pushed too much? I just figured friends can be straight up. Neither side is budging. AITA?"		1	0

The bar was managed by a group of young people, so we ended up blurring lines with our customers and partying with them. It was never a career for me and I loved being paid to drink and hang out.

One of our regular couples was Heather and Jay. Heather was a tiny, beautiful blonde, and Jay was a huge, burly man, and they used to pound double vodka redbulls every second night. At least once a week Jay would rip into Heather, in front of the entire bar, about her being a cheating slut. It was so strategic, and he'd only stop when she let him look through her phone and hid in the bathroom to stop crying. Then he'd ""forgive"" her and SHE would apologise to us.

My manager (who I stupidly dated) eventually told me that Jay was, in fact, sleeping with his ex-wife, who was friends with Heather (seriously). My manager was really involved in their lives, going over for dinner and shit, so he always made sure I didn't meddle when I saw our customers doing shitty things.

I ended up quitting a few months later because I honestly couldn't take the misogyny and BS I witnessed (it was horrific). A lot of men came to hate me for cock-blocking them (they'd ply young girls with alcohol and then try to carry them into their cars).

Heather and I had texted infrequently, but she ended up adding me on FB and my timeline was suddenly flooded with pics of her and Jay and his ex. It ate at me, and eventually I ended up messaging her telling her what I had heard, and that it was never my place to intervene before but, if it was me, I'd want to know.

She ended up running to Jay and the whole thing became a shitshow. My ex-manager (and ex) ended up lying and said I made it up for attention, Jay threatened to visit me at my workplace, and his ex-wife and her fiance laid into me via text. It became obvious that Heather didn't want to acknowledge anything, even though their behaviour pretty much confirmed it, and they all chose to write me off as the problem (which is fine).

I got mixed reviews from the people in my life; some say I did the right thing, but others say Heather had already endured so much abuse and I should have known she wasn't going to leave, or that it wasn't my place at all. I know I'd want to know if my SO was cheating, but I also believe, even if it's in the far future, maybe all of these things will stack up and help Heather leave. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c0wc55	2019-06-15 11:30:19		AITA for joking that my baby daughter (7mo) is going to be gay as a response to those “shotgun dad” jokes?	"First things first, I have absolutely nothing against anyone in their desire to find and cherish their version of true love. 

At the same time I have also been known as a crass joker, often taking myself down with my jokes. For instance, I’ve joked about how bad I am at math even though I’m half Asian and white, proving that whiteness rounds up. Just simple one liners and then I return to work or thoughtful conversation, whatever the situation.

I guess I am a product of the military which is one huge melting pot of good natured shit talking.

But I have one rule and that is that I would never  directly pick on anyone about their own life. I joke about myself and life situations.

Anyways, we were at a group dinner last night and me and my wife brought our beautiful 7 mo old daughter. The conversation basically went like this:

Them: She’s so beautiful, I bet you already have the shotguns lined up for when she grows and the boys are lining up!

Me: Nah, it turns out she’s going to be gay and gay girls can’t get pregnant! No shotgun necessary.

I laugh, my wife laughs, two people snicker awkwardly, and I get some hot stares from the rest.

Am I the asshole? Obviously I wasn’t serious, and I felt like my joke was a perfect stupid counter to the stupid old shotgun comment."		1	0

On mobile so apologies for formatting.

My upstairs neighbour and his girlfriend smoke weed in their apartment every day 3 or 4 times.

Me and my partner know this because they smell drifts down through a chimney that connects the two apartments.

I've asked 6 times now over the last year for them to stop, or go to a window on the opposite side of the apartment. My neighbour is always apologetic and says he is doing everything to stop the smell, but it's still coming down.

I am fine with people smoking weed and unwinding after work but I don't want to smell it while I'm trying to relax where I live. I also have a baby and I'm worried that it could be a safeguarding issue for him.

I feel like after a year of not being listened to, I should tell the landlord that they're smoking in a non smoking building, but would that make me the asshole?

She's staying in our apartment for the summer for classes but she went home to visit. I knew the day she was coming back (today) and offered to pick her up.

This issue happened yesterday.

She had told me, about a week ago, that someone else wanted to pick her up. We will call him Joseph. She didn't want Joseph to, so I asked her how she would tell him no, and she said I don't know. So I told her let me know if you still need me to.

Fast forward to yesterday, i double checked that she was having Joseph pick her up. I made plans to travel home for father's day (I'm also staying in the apartment) since she told me she was having him pick her up and she would let me know what time her flight was getting here if I needed to pick her up (she didn't). 

I ended up telling her Joseph has to pick her up and I won't. She claims she didn't tell me he would pick her up, but rather that he just wanted to. She never told me her flight info or that she needed me to and what I understood was that he was going to pick her up. But she's upset with me for making plans and not picking her up and is mad because I had told her I would pick her up.

c0w991	2019-06-15 11:18:49	AshamedCareer1	AITA for being upset my friend cancelled possibly vague plans with me?	"A friend and I have gotten into a bit of an argument. I think we're both bringing a lot of baggage to the situation, so I'd love an objective opinion on whether my friend was a bit rude in this situation or whether I was overreacting.

Last night, my friend sent out a message to our group's chat saying ""What are people getting into today?"". This is a common refrain in our group from people who are looking to hang out with people, and one that he specifically has made before that has always been followed by making plans.

A couple people, myself included, said we weren't up to anything and would be down to hang out. He responds about an hour later with ""I'm heading out for a few drinks with some friends. We shouldn't be out late so for those who are free later, let's connect in a bit"".

3 hours later, and quite late in the evening, I ask ""Are we still planning to hang out?"". He never responds.


I feel like he blew me and our other friends off to go hang out with different friends (who actually mutual friends of both of us), he feels like he was just checking in with people and couldn't have been more clear that he was not actually making plans with us.

Edit: I forgot to add why this upset me! So, I had reeeeally been wanting to hang out with people last night, and had already started forming plans with one friend that we were going to bring forward to the group. I didn't do that, because I felt like he was going to be making plans once he was done drinking with our other friends and didn't want to take over what he wanted to do.

As another note: though mutual friends, the people he went drinking with are not in this group chat and weren't the people who had responded in the group chat.

He comes back drinking and I tell him he can't have it and start getting upset so I go to the back and work on something else. To avoid them.

I'm going to start off by saying that my mother is a very kind but a sensitive person, she wants the best for me and wants me to be happy (as I can see) but sometimes I feel like if I don't want her to help me she gets offended.

Today we were shopping and she told me that I should buy new shorts cause the ones that I have look old ... I couldn't find anything that I liked and that's where she started to get angry. First of all ,I didn't want her to buy me anything and I told her that , but she didn't understand which got me outraged. Like why would she even get angry at something that I didn't ask her to do.
Anyways, I didn't care no more and we ended up buying one .
When we got home she seemed still angry and I asked what's her problem . She told me that I spoke to her disrespectful (??????). I told her that  I didn't asked for her help and she kept forcing it and it is not my problem that she got offended . I mean yeah she wanted good for me but I didn't ask for it and I think I have the right to say no.
I told her that she has no right to tell me how to dress like I do not tell her how to . ( yeah I know I shouldn't have said that....) After this she completely broke down emotionally. I might've been disrespectful at the shopping center but I feel like she kept on focusing HOW I speak not WHAT I speak... 
This thing ""being disrespectful"" caused a lot of arguments between us. I admit that deeply I judge her cause she believes some stupid pseudo science shit which is absolutely ridiculous and this might be the cause of me being disrespectful.

I want to hear your advice so this never happens again .

It was with my mom's closest friend, who is in her early 40s but she's beautiful. I always felt like she kind of liked me. I thought I was a little delusional but there was something about the way she complimented me, acted around me, looked at me, etc.; and the feeling was getting stronger and stronger as time went on. Her husband is someone I've obviously met countless times. I don't dislike him at all but I've also never had an interesting conversation with him or formed a personal connection with him. His personality is just the polar opposite of mine. Since I was going to be in the neighborhood, my mom had me bring her friend's book of CDs that she left at our house back to her. I got to her house and handed her the CDs, but she told me to come in so she could show me something. She grabbed me by the hand and pulled me in. It was a (pretty great) painting. The Paul McCartney album Ram was on in the background. I don't know the name of the song but its chorus went ""My love is long"" or something of the like and I said ""Ha, I bet he's talking about his dick."" She grabbed my hand and started hysterically laughing at my incredibly shitty joke. Then she looked at me for a solid three seconds and kissed me. I was shocked, nervous, but also insanely excited. I couldn't believe that the woman I'd had fantasies about had just kissed me. I was horny and the question of ""What about her husband"" left my mind as quickly as it had entered it. She looked nervous for a second as well until I kissed her back, and then things progressed incredibly quickly. She told me she was on birth control, so, uh... yeah. It was... quite brief. It felt like ten minutes, but it was probably much shorter. When it was over, reality came back and I was instantly flooded with shame and regret, but she had the opposite reaction. She smiled and put her face on my chest while I felt like I was about to puke. She didn't say a word. About ten minutes later I simply said ""I'm gonna go"" and she just ""Alright. See ya round."" And I left shaking. I haven't seen her or her husband since but I've felt like a shitty person for the past week. I do not intent to ever sleep with her again."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I reside in the Philippines, and being a ninong (godfather in local language) is kind of important if filipino tradition. And considered very rude to decline or refuse being one. 

Now, I'm an introvert. I think it all stems from that. I have people that I'm cool with, albeit, I don't consider them as friends. I mean, I probably won't be in touch with them when they or I leave my job.

My coworker, 25F just had a baby, and wants me to be the ninong of her daughter. When she asked me if I was up for it, I told her yes. As if I had a choice.

The baptismal and mass will be on a sunday, my day off as well. And I made up a total bullshit of a reason and told her I won't be able to attend the event. Now the poor kid will have one less ninong in her baptismal picture, and most probably a ninong that'll ghost her as she ages.

It was 2am and i got a phone call, i always have my phone on silent, ofcourse except this for this night. It was my friend, i couldnt comprehend wat was said so i was a bit confused of wtf was happening. The call ended after a small 5/10 sec. She texted me she was sorry because her son did that. I didnt reply, i have troubles with sleeping in, so i wanted to sleep. The next morning she texted me that he was walking around till 2.30am. Im most of the days cranky in the morning and i was also a bit pissed off because i had a shitty night and that was the first thing she said to me in the morning. So i snapped at her that i didnt find it normal that he is walking around late at night while everybody was sleeping and that he is supposed to be sleeping too. 

*Note that this happened on the upper floor and that they still dont have a stair gate. I find this highly irresponsible because the bathroom with cleaning stuff is closeby and kids will find a way if possible.(Unfortunally in their previous house, this has happened before with their son, thank god everything ended good) I have said weeks before that its maybe a good time now to get a stairgate en put the handle of the doors up, so he cant get out by himself. But those changes are still not made.*

Later i apologized for snapping at her and that i now understood that kids will be walking around at night. But again stated my points as above. She said that she and her boyfriend were kinda mad at me because 'those things happen.' I dont have kids so i dont know what is normal or not. But now im thinking about it, i still actually feel a bit in my right for snapping.. 1. Because of wat has happened before and 2.

c0w0g8	2019-06-15 10:42:49		AITA For letting a neighbours cat into my house	"Probably not what you're expecting, but the issue isn't that the cat belongs to my neighbour. He's almost an exclusive outdoor cat, the neighbour knows I let him in, and I never let him stay in at nighttime so nobody worries about where he is!

The issue is actually whether I'm being an asshole to my cat, which I'm worried I might be, so yes this is going to be a silly lighthearted post I guess.

I have two cats Tyrone and Spud. Spud is a tiny little 13 yo rescue that had a really horrible start to life. As such, she is in no way cuddly, and pretty hostile. She gives good headboops, but in generally is just to nervous for affection.

About a year ago my cuddly cat Mambo got hit by a car. After a few months, I decided to adopt another to play and cuddle with, Tyrone. Tyrone is a bit of a weird egg, you're stereotypical cat that people who don't like cats imagine. Usually friendly, you can pet him but he might randomly loose his shit. Now I know him quite well so he never scratches me because I know not to annoy him, but he's not cuddly at all. Which is disappointing but he's still a great character.

Cut to about a month ago, my neighbours cat started wandering down to my garden, and he is exactly like mambo - super friendly, laid back and cuddly. So I gave him pets and food, and since then he regularly comes in to sit on my lap.

Now, I feel bad because Tedrone doesn't like him. They don't fight physically, but Ted will chase him or hiss, but since he is smaller than the new cat, he never does anything. For context, Ted is also a little asshole that bullies Spud, while the new cat mostly just ignores his presence.

I feel like an asshole because even though my Ted is a little shit, I feel bad for just letting another cat come in to the house. At the same time, if Ted is going to be a mean little shit, to Spud, me and in general, I think I'm happy to continue cuddling the new cat. I feel like this is sounds like some weird analogy for cheating, but anyway, am I the asshole for cuddling other cats?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c0w0eb	2019-06-15 10:42:34		AITA for eating popcorn in the cinema?	"Hi guys,

I watched a movie today, during which i was eating a bag of popcorn. When the movie ended, a lady sitting behind me confronted me about my eating. She claimed that i ""ruined the movie for her"" and that all she could hear during the movie was my crunching and crinkling. She then went on to call me ""ignorant and rude""

A few facts:
- Before the movie started, i noticed that many of the other members of the audience had bags if chips and snacks
- By the end if the movie, i was probably the only person still eating (however there isn't a rule that you can only eat at the start of the movie?)
- It was a relatively small room, 5 rows of 7 seats
- In hindsight, my crinkling (moreso than by crunching) WAS pretty loud in a small, silent cinema
- At no point during the movie did anyone ask me to stop eating or to be more quiet

My main issue was how she confronted me. She was very aggresive and made me seem like an absolutely horrible person. If she had simply told me that i had been too loud, and that i should be aware for future regerence in a polite manner, i wouldn't be so upset. Also, if she had tapped me in the shoulder and ask me to stop eating during the movie, i definetly would have stopped. She didn't have to 'suffer' through the whole movie??

I think i should have been more conscientious about the other members of the audience, but i don't think what i did was as out of line as she described? I don't think i've ever even noticed other peopel eating during movies. In Australia, snacks in cinemas are very normal.

It was fun until I had accurately no friends, I wasn’t learning anything more and everyone disrespected the higher ranks. It also wasn’t fun because I had a MAJOR anxiety attack that I currently have PTSD because of the trauma I experienced. I hate it now and my mam has allowed me to leave— after a lot of begging and so forth.

Now she wants me to join the air cadets.

She says “only for one night to see if [you] like it.”

She wants me to go into a completely new thing, in a completely new detachment, make new friends (and I have literal social anxiety and my social-based autism makes me very unaware to normal things that I can’t even stick to) and start out at the more basic things while being older than most of the basics by 3 years.

“They have fieldcraft, and you did that at army cadets.” Yeah, I also get lowerkey PTSD to those horrible times.

“They do drill.” So did army cadets, but my favourite subject wasn’t enough to keep me there.

Like, I’m so damn conflicted, okay. I really, really do not want to go and screw up socially and disappoint my mam even further (because if I say I don’t like it after that night she probably won’t even accept it). I really want to do more club things so I can actually do more outside of school/the college I will soon be at (because I go on a lot of games to fill the time and soothe myself). However I don’t think this is the way to get me to do it. Forcing me into an activity that’s really close to something traumatic. I think I’d do much better if I wanted to do it. There isn’t a lot to do around here though..

So my mam basically says I have no friends and I’m disappointing her. I feel like I have no way out because I get really upset by this entire thing and probably would start crying. I wouldn’t be able to persuade her otherwise. I just hate the idea and I’m so upset even just typing this. I don’t want to try it even though I’ll be forced.

At first i thought it was just a simple argument but then they decided we should bet 10$ each on it , i agreed and we all shook on it( in our friend group handshakes are sacred) so the GOTY awards roll around and god of war won, i was so happy not because of the money but because god of war is an amazing game , so i text them reminding them of the bet they straight up say “ if kratos comes to my house in a suit and threatens me i still wouldn’t give you the money” i thought they were joking , they weren’t, i told them that we shook on it and kept talking about it for the last month , they said they were joking about the bet , i blocked them and avoided them in school completely ....

c0vyep	2019-06-15 10:33:29	SophisticatedPhallus	AITA For being upset with my roommate for leaving his kids at my house to go to the bar?	"So a little backstory/context to start things off. I have my own place and things got a little tight and I needed a roommate a year ago. I had a friend I knew was unhappy with his living situation because he was far away from his kids (5 and 9) so didn’t get to see them often (among other things). I thought it would be a win-win, I get help on rent and he’s closer to his kids and in a nice house to bring them to that he wouldn’t have access to otherwise. He now gets to see his kids more often. Which I generally think is good for all parties involved. 

Without getting into too much irrelevant details, I only really have one problem. He goes to the bar every night. That’s fine, I don’t care that he’s there until close or later every night.  I’m a drinker too, just more from home. So you do you,  until it effects me. My problem is when he has his kids, after he puts them to sleep in his room, it’s still off to the bar. He just leaves his kids here, doesn’t ask me to keep an eye out or anything. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I have HIS kids in my house unsupervised. Often time I’m home but asleep when he leaves his kids alone here (I know because I wake up to pee around 2-3 am regularly and he’s not home).  Other times like tonight I was out all night too, and came home to him gone with the kids home asleep. Alone. Now admittedly, his kids generally sleep through the night at 5 and 9 with no problems. It’s never been a thing where they’ve woke up freaked out and been like “where’s my dad”.  But that’s not hat point. I just don’t want to have to deal with the responsibility of his kids left in my house, especially because he never asked to keep an eye on them (can’t do that when I’m asleep even if I was willing.) 

We did have a conversation about this a couple months ago, and he thought I was an asshole for even being uncomfortable with him leaving his kids here to go drink. He says it’s his kids so I have no say, and that I’m overreacting. He was drunk at the very least during the conversation. We didn’t come to any agreement. Shit gets  glossed over and we move on. Its recently been apparent that he is still doing this, and I’m still not cool with it. He thought I was overreacting and says it’s not my problem basically. Well it’s my house and I disagree with that strongly. His kids in my house is my problem whether I like it or not. 

Would I be TAH if I told him this needs to stop? Again, nothing bad has happened, I just don’t like him leaving his young kids alone in my house to go drink. I’m really just looking for a way of approaching this conversation in a way that he won’t try to be super defensive again. Of course I’ll catch him sober next time.

He got back on Friday and we went to his parents for dinner with his sister and her boyfriend and he was talking about it he's never been to Saudi Arabia before and no one at the table had been either so it was interesting. I just off hand said I would have been scared to travel to the middle east and my boyfriend even said himself that he was a little nervous and he even had his work hire security for the team so it's not some unfounded fear that only I have but his sisters boyfriend who apparently is middle eastern but born in the US called me a racist and said I've never been there and shouldn't judge based on the media. He's never been there either funnily enough but anyway I just said like it's not racist there are tensions over there, i'm a blonde american girl, like terrorism aside, human trafficking is a big issue everywhere in the world even in the states but honestly I kind of just said it without thinking and I didn't even know her boyfriend was middle eastern.

"Throwaway because some of my friends know my main account and I don't want them to know about this story for a while. Anyways, this just happened today. About a week ago, I matched with a girl on tinder and we started to talk. I was visiting the city she lived in and would be leaving in about 2 weeks. We kinda hit it off and talked a lot. We made plans to meet up and get drinks. However, this girl gave me some bad vibes. For example, this girl knew that I was going to leave in 2 weeks and accepted that fact, however, she wanted to pretend that we were dating, calling me babe and such. She even went so far as to say she loved me. I played into it a little, thinking whats the harm, she knows I'm going to leave and had made it clear I didn't think anything would persist after I left. However, I never went so far as to tell her I loved her. 

&#x200B;

Finally, we met up today to spend the day together. However, when I met her, I saw that her pictures online were very different from how she was in real life. I have no problems with a woman's weight, but she was much heavier than what she had made herself out to be. Furthermore, there were other features about her that she had not effectively communicated in her pictures. I immediately felt very uncomfortable because I thought the person I knew was very different from the actual person I met. I followed her to the subway and we got on the train together, but she was very affectionate and open in this public area and it made me very uncomfortable. So at the next stop I told her I had forgotten something at home and needed to run back home. She said okay, she would text me later where to meet up. When I got home, I deleted her off social media and effectively stopped all communication without further messages. I feel like I should have said something before removing her, but I didn't know how to say ""you weren't how I had made you out to be"" without being insulting, so I figured it would be better to say nothing at all.

c0vsce	2019-06-15 10:07:14	angryand5foot3	aita for pronouncing spanish words correctly?	"let me start off by saying i am white. everybody i am related to by blood is white. my family history as far as we know is about as caucasian as boiled chicken with no seasoning. 

my native language is english, but i can also speak spanish. i’m nowhere near fluent, but i can understand it well, can write in it with little dictionary help, know all the grammar and conjugation rules and can hold a basic conversation. my dad is white, but he and his family lived in a spanish speaking country for a part of his childhood, so he is fluent in spanish and he has been teaching me since i was about two years old. in addition to this i’ve been learning spanish in school for as long as it has been available (about 10 years).  so, even though i’m not super great at being able to hold a proper intellectual conversation in spanish without rehearsal, my pronounciation is pretty on point (to the point where actual spanish speakers have been surprised when they realise that no i can’t actually speak their language properly). because of this, i tend to pronounce spanish words in english conversations as they are actually pronounced in spanish (tortilla with a y, horchata w/out the h, you get the idea). this has always been normal for me because that’s just how i learned to pronounce certain words. however, i have a friend that will put me down and berate me whenever i do this. they’ll mock me and say that i’m “too white” to be speaking like that.  

am i actually too white to be pronouncing certain words in the way that they’re pronounced in spanish? is it somehow offensive or bad? if not, what can i say to her to shut her up when she gives me shit for it? 

personally, i have never thought it was an issue and have never experienced any complaints from others apart from this. however, i like to stay as *woke* as possible and if there is any way that me speaking in this way despite being whiter than clapping on airplanes could be offensive to anybody that is unbeknownst to me,  please educate me. thanks

edit for those asking for more info: no, i don’t tend to try and correct others when they pronounce it the english way, and while the friend doesn’t get seriously upset, the way they speak about it very much implies that they think that i’m doing something wrong or stupid."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c0vqst	2019-06-15 10:00:33	mintyfreshpotato	AITA for not paying for my sister's bfs food?	"So me and my sister went out for a meal, and she asked if her bf could join us. I have no problem with that so he tags along (or I become the third wheel here, unclear, doesn't matter). For context I am single.

What we normally do is we pay for the dishes we order, rather than splitting things 50/50. We've always done in this way ever since we were kids, and she does tend to eat a lot more than me, and i don't drink alcohol so i usually get a smaller bill than her at the end of it.

We order food, and the total for what i eat I'm calculating as i buy is just under £20. I'm not fully keeping track of what my sister and her BF are ordering but the bill at the end is just shy of £100. Everything is fine and i flag down the server to ask for a bill, and ask for it to be split 3 ways. So at this point I'm already contributing to what they've eaten as mine was only a 5th of the bill.

My sister immediately goes quiet and I can see her giving me dirty looks, but Idk why. Her BF is oblivious and on his phone. 
I pay a third and then my sister asks for the rest of the bill to be put into one so she can pay the rest off.

We leave the restaurant and as soon as we're a way away my sister EXPLODES at me. Apparently she and her boyfriend have a system where they take turns paying for food bills, so she was only expecting to pay half of the cost of that meal, not 2/3. She's trying to save for a house with her bf and only works part time, she can't afford this much.

She demands I paypal her over enough money to split the bill 50/50. I refuse, pointing out I didn't eat nearly as much as them, or have dessert, and i've already paid for more than i bought. Her BF is just looking surprised and doesn't say anything (he's not the type to be confrontational). She rants a little longer and walks off.

At this point i head off to get a coffee, and text her to say I'm planning to leave after I've drunk it. I drove us here, so i'm still expecting to take them back. The restaurant is on a bus route so she's not stranded.

The only response i get is a paypal request for money. I refuse it, text her again to tell her I'm leaving, and give her a phonecall for good measure. She doesn't answer so i go home.

This was about a week ago. She is still not speaking to me, and if she does it's to demand money, and something towards the bus fare back. I've been told to keep the peace i should just give her the money, after all it's ""only about £30""

My mum has also offered to loan my sister half of the cost towards a house to pay back without interest in her own time. She hasn't offered me the same when I'm also saving for a house (i work full time but I am not making enough to splash out), so i also need to watch my finances.

&#x200B;

This January, my grandfather passed away due to an accident. I've never met a 94 year old with as much energy as him, but at that age all that it takes is some bad luck and a single fall. 

&#x200B;

My granddad had two children, my mother and a son. The son had two children and my mother three. My siblings and cousins are all in their mid forties, while I'm in my late twenties. I met my cousins once or twice growing up, but up until the distribution of the estate and the cleaning of my granddads apartment I didn't have any relation to them. We got along well though and I was happy to feel I might have two new family members in my life going forward.

&#x200B;

I took it upon me to manage the paperwork associated with the burial site and future care of it. Granddads wish was to be buried in the existing grave of my late mother and his late wife. The cost of this is 15 Euros per year, per person. I sent a breakdown of costs to all parties involved and received no objection until a month later, when the arrangements were already made.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing, my cousins don't want to pay the full cost of their share of the grave, as my mother and our grandmother rest there too. They figure they should only pay for our grandfather, as they didn't like their grandmother all that much and they didn't really know their aunt that well. 

&#x200B;

In the end they sent all the money, but said that as far as they're concerned the money should last 15 years instead of the four it actually will. It was his will to be buried there, they were happy to take part of the estate and the fact that establishing a new grave, against his wises, would mean a similar cost. I feel they're being unreasonable here.

&#x200B;

I couldn't wrap my head around their thinking at the time and basically broke off contact saying I hope they reconsider. I figure I'm better off not having them in my life, but I've had this thought in the back of my head that maybe I'm the Asshole here. Am I?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So a little backstory first, I'm 14 years old and a son of a shopkeeper. I was playing Call of Duty Multiplayer when this happens, so as you know, it can't be paused. Now onto the story itself. 
When my dad told me to work, I deny it, saying that ""The game can't be paused."" or something like that. Appearantly, this angered him and he started insulting me, calling me ungrateful and how he's not gonna feed me anything, etc. This isn't the first time something like this happens too. Then my mom came with foods and my dad interrupts her and said ""Don't give him food!"" or something like that and told me to obey him or get out of the house, I then replied by saying that he's authoritorian and thankfully, my mom sort of put an end to this argument but I don't think it'll laat that long. So AITA?

c0vohr	2019-06-15 09:50:16		AITA for wanting to prioritise my work over my family?	"Just from the title the answer would be obvious but there is more to the situation.

I work in medical research and I am part of a relatively small team. I really enjoy my work and I can see how it is improving the outcomes for all patients and families not just on my unit but worldwide. I feel that I want to work more so potentially more lives can be saved or more effective treatments can be found. The other side of this is that the more work we do the more money we generate and this is used to pay for more staff so more research can be done and it is also used to pay for education and equipment for all of the staff that work on the unit not just the research team. So there are so many people that benefit from the work that I and the rest of the team do. 

I just have the feeling that I could be doing more good being in work than being home. The difficulty is that I have a young family and my wife wants me to be at home to help. It’s not that I don’t want to look after the children I love them all. But I feel guilty that there may be a greater good that I could be doing. 

TL:DR: I do important medical research. I want to work more but have a young family."		1	0
c0voh1	2019-06-15 09:50:11	MisanthropeX	AITA for leaving a bad review for a luxury hotel that didn't offer to fetch something for me?	"This happened about 4 years ago. I was there in my capacity as a mystery shopper: think of me like an undercover hotel critic that produces an internal review for the hotel owners: I wasn't leaving a nasty yelp review.

I was reviewing an upscale ""boutique"" hotel in the Hamptons, where the rooms were costing me $500 a night (not that I was paying out of pocket, but that shows you the clientele whose mindset I was trying to put myself into). The hotel was in a converted summer camp with bungalows and a ""rustic"" theme. One thing that was advertised on their website was that every room came with a grill for barbecuing. So when I came to check in, I brought some meat with me to BBQ since I hadn't done so in a while.

To my surprise, while the grills were advertised online, there was no charcoal or fuel. When I went to the front desk to ask for some, the woman running the front desk seemed surprised, and then recommended me a store nearby where I could buy some. I mentioned that it was a long walk away, and she offered to let me rent a bike free of charge to go there.

I've reviewed plenty of luxury hotels in this job, and for $500 a night I would expect them to stock charcoal so I could grill if it's advertised on the website. And if they *didn't*, they should have sent someone to a store or supplier to go get me some, without my asking. I did notice that there only seemed to be one bellman or porter for the entire hotel, and very little staff overall. To be clear: I am perfectly capable of riding a bike to the store and buying charcoal, but while I was *mildly* miffed that it wasn't available or provided to me for free (or as part of a resort fee) I would imagine the target clientele might be *more* pissed.

In my internal review, I was asked if the staff fulfilled my needs and I said no. I later polled a few other people in my industry, and people seemed split down the middle about whether it was reasonable to expect charcoal be provided, that if it wasn't provided someone should've gone to the store *for* me, and if whether or not suggesting a store and offering a bicycle for me to buy my own charcoal ""fulfilled my needs.""

I argued that if I were paying Ritz prices in the Hamptons I should've been given free charcoal or, at the very least, offered something like a free meal in the hotel restaurant because I couldn't cook my own food."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So I have a very small house, I work 45hrs a week 8-5 monday to friday. I live with my Fiancee but she only works three days a week. I pay all the bills including food and electric. Which she uses most of when she's home during the days.

I got up this morning and got ready to visit my dad. I went to use my beard trimmer which was on charge, she unplugged it to dry her hair last night and never plugged it back in even though she said she would. I've had to put on unwashed trousers because she hasn't bothered doing any laundry, which I often have to end up doing on the weekends. I then had to search for my wallet because when she was ""tidying"" she didn't put it back in the spot I've told her to put it. And I'm still not able to find the belt I wanted as she constantly puts things in the wrong places without telling me. This happens pretty much every weekend and I'm starting to feel like an asshole complaining to her every time about it.

So out of frustration, I've turned the house upside down. Without throwing or breaking anything, I've made a mess of the house. Thrown pillows and the blanket off the sofa. Coats and shoes everywhere. The laundry is all over the floor. I've thrown letters and cards all over the place and gently put some things she cares about over the floor to look as if i've been careless.

She is at work today and I'll be at my dads until the evening and she'll come home before me to a messy house, like I do most days.

c0vn7q	2019-06-15 09:44:37	ComedicCatastrophe	AITA for being a little pissed at my friend for this?	"Ok so, backstory, I am a shitty swimmer, no one taught me how to swim properly, the only reason I can even go to the beach is because as an 8 year old I just decided to walk into the water one day and I swam some sort of way

So usually nowadays when I’m on the beach I bring a pool float and either swim in circles and get a little water exercise or just relax, good enough right?

Apparently not, because my friend wants me to swim a thousand laps with her as if I’m a professional athlete, to make me do this she will:

1. Push me and the float far away into the deeper parts of the water

2. Shake the float while I’m on it

3. Flip it (yes, while I’m on it)

Basically she will make me as uncomfortable as possible to pressure me into leaving the float

And when I do finally leave the float, she just pushes me in the water and makes me fall multiple times

When I tell her “hey can you not? I’m a shitty swimmer and you’re probably going to kill me someday like this” (probably won’t, but still) she just tells me to swim right now to learn, but that’s a little hard when she’s actively pushing me around, isn’t it?

Why I might be the asshole:

This friend has a few mental problems, not like anything severe, she doesn’t have a diagnosis, she just lacks a little bit of mental capacity? Is a little bit behind the rest? she has a bit of issues with understanding logic and on a few places (like logic for example) she has the mentality of a child a few years younger than we are (we are in our teens, high school)

So, am I the asshole for being a little pissed over this? I’m obviously not fuming, but it annoys me a little bit, I don’t get to stand or sit still for a second in the water without her pushing me"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I will be eligible for vacation at the time of the cruise, but our weekly schedules are from Sunday to Saturday.  Since i work shift work the company only allows vacation to start on Sunday and end on Saturday rather than choosing the days I have off. The cruise is Friday through Sunday, and no off days coincide with it unless I’m on my long weekend. Since I’m the newest man I switch shifts regularly so I have no idea what shift I’ll be on in December at the time of the cruise. Also, vacation is based off seniority so if too many people are asking at that time I won’t get the vacation. 

When the cruise was mentioned I told my MIL from the beginning that I most likely wouldn’t be able to go due to my work schedule. She and my wife were talking about it this past weekend and I mentioned again that I most likely wouldn’t be able to go. Immediately my wife and MIL started explaining that I’d better be able to go since they already paid for it even when I told them last year that I most likely wouldn’t be able to go.

So me and my girlfriend are expecting our first child in October a baby girl. More than anything I wanna name our baby after my brother who I lost a few years ago to heatstroke. He was extremely important to me and was the person I could tell everything and he never judged me. simply helped or gave advice. He was an extremely kind soul. His name was Halldór and in memory of him I wanted to name our baby Halldòra in the first or second I honestly didn't and don't mind which. My Gf has been open about hating the name since the beginning but I hoped she would warm up to it so I went along and looked at other names that would fit with it as she wants to.name the baby out of the blue not after someone. I pressed and I regret that now.

Eventually we were at her brothers and were talking with his wife about names and after I said yeah no we don't have anything she goes well the middle name Halldòra is likely. I was surprised and happy. On the way home I wanted to make sure she was sure about this. After a bit of prodding she blows up and we get in a fight where she tells me she absolutely hates it and doesn't want to name our child after someone who is dead and she never knew. I was heartbroken after getting my hopes up.

More stuff went down that night. she had a lot going on in her mind and she just broke. She ended up going to the hospital for two days (mental institute) and she is doing a lot better now.

I have not pushed the matter at all since. But I still hope .everyday that she changes her mind and haves a conversation about it. I honestly think I would be heartbroken to not name it after my Brother and it hurts a lot knowing that probably wont happen.

So I feel like Ta for pushing it at first then again after she accepts it because It was too strange and now I feel like an asshole for still wanting it.

"I wanted to take my little 3-month old baby sister out on a stroll around our village earlier, so my dad and other sister decided to go with me. After a few minutes of being outside, my dad saw the sky was dark and it could rain. I jokingly said that maybe we should bring an umbrella, but no one paid attention to me so I put that thought behind me. Plus, the stroller had a built-in cover for shade so I wasn’t too worried. We were only planning to make one round around the village so I figured we wouldn’t get caught in the rain.

I was sooo wrong, lol.

When we were back on our street again, just a short distance away from our house, it started to drizzle, so we started walking faster. I put the cover over the baby’s head and covered her legs with the towel I brought along. Then it started to rain bullets. My dad started screaming (I’m not exaggerating, he really screamed) at my sister and I. He was cursing his head off really loudly as we were running towards our house. We passed by a couple who were entering their car and they were looking at us, mainly because of my dad who was making a huge commotion. He was literally yelling “Fuck, fuck, fuck! I told you so, we shouldn’t have left the house!” in another language. I was trying to stay calm and cover the baby as much as possible while we were running. My dad pulled the stroller over to one of the stores a few feet from our house for cover since we were seriously soaking by that time, and he was *still* yelling. He yelled at me, telling me to call my mom for help. So I ran to my house to call for her and get umbrellas. There was a lady with an umbrella who actually helped, staying with my dad and sister until my mom and I could get them. My dad was just so unpleasant, ordering me around and indirectly blaming me for this since I was the one who wanted to go out in the first place. He was blowing his top off in front of this kind stranger, shouting loudly enough for the neighbors to hear. The lady was just amused by our predicament, and I smiled apologetically at her as my mom thanked her. So as soon as we all got home, my dad was making some mean comments, then he slammed his phone on our divider when he passed by it. My mom, before this, was being calm and taking care of my baby sister. She said that “stuff like this happens, we can’t blame anybody. It already happened.” When he went upstairs to change, I told my mom about his attitude and she confronted him about it and told him he shouldn’t have made such a big scene about it. He, of course, was livid. So yeah, they started fighting and screaming and now they’re not talking to each other. I feel bad because tomorrow’s Fathers’ Day, too. 

My dad is always blowing things out of proportion. I know it’s partly my fault for us getting caught out in the rain but I think he could’ve handled it better, being the parent between us. I also understand why he was upset since the baby could get sick, but he was such an immature jerk about it. Am I the asshole?"		1	0

long story short one of my wife's friends tried to have sex with me I refused as I was not going to cheat on my wife, and when I said no she tried having sex with me and I had to physically get up and leave for her to understand it was a no. 

I've asked my wife multiple times that I hate that she is friends with that woman and she seems to not care. she is telling me i can not control who her friends are and that they are her friends not mine. 

she is still hanging out with this woman and every time I ask her not to she tells me I'm an asshole, am I?

I can answer any questions you have.

c0vhaa	2019-06-15 09:18:25	Sunstrider95	WIBTA if I won't go pick up a present?	"Hello everyone, let me give a bit of context to the question.

&#x200B;

Me and my friends usually put our money together for the birthdays of other friends and we buy one big thing that the person really wants instead of just each of us buying random stuff separately. Now in my group of friends everyone except me is working and its been like this for the past three years or so. Until last year i was a student and since may 2018 i had a free year until i will start a masters program in September.

&#x200B;

Because i had the most free time over the years, every birthday i was the one to go to the mall or to the post to pick-up the presents. Also when we wanted to buy something for the group like a board game, or even take-out food for that particular evening it was expected of me to be the one that goes and gets it.

&#x200B;

Now we are discussing buying another present for a friends the next few days, and I do not want to be the person that goes and gets it. I mean I get it that i have the most free time, but why should i be the only one that sacrifices his free time for things like this.

&#x200B;

So would i be the asshole if i said ""I know you are working and are busy guys but i will not go this time, decide who else will do it?"""	Asshole	0	0

c0vgrc	2019-06-15 09:16:03	windy0804	AITA when I [F27] asked my husband [M33] if I have to masturbate in the rest of my life?	"We just married 2 months ago, but we have had sex for over a year. Before moving in together, we met twice a week and had sex once every time we met, rarely twice as he felt very tired, easy to cum and I can only cum once. However, it's hard for me to satisfy... Now, when we married, we still have sex only twice a week. This makes me really uncomfortable because I need more, but he doesn't... Or I can say he... can't afford. It's like we have sex 8-10 times a month and I can only cum 1 or 2. Already talk to him about the problem and ask if we can discuss a solution. He took the responsibility and admitted that he was... ""weak""! He said he would try but nothing has changed. He also blamed that I was also kinda hard to satisfy (my two ex told me the same). It feels like he always try to avoid talking about the problem. And one day, I accidentally asked him if I have to masturbate in the rest of my life. He wasn't angry but I felt guilty myself. He is a great man to me, and I love him very much... Only this problem needs to be concerned...

c0vge2	2019-06-15 09:14:38		AITA for not wanting fiances ex wife at our wedding?	"I have been with fiance for almost 3 years now. Before I had met ex, she would frequently insult me behind my back.  I first met her a few months into my relationship, and, for roughly 8 months after, she would also not even look at me while together, which we often were, as they have kids. While I cant imagine what its like to see my ex hus with someone new, I took it very personal and found it immature and hurtful.

After things cooled down, I figured she was just hurting, and I have since apologized for judging her situation and potentially making it harder. She looks at me now, but we arent on chummy talking terms just yet. 

Im not really sure how to describe the relationship between her and my fiance. From my POV, she is just mean to him. She frequently throws fits, makes wild, baseless accusations (mostly about him not loving his kids), and insults him. 

He only wants the best for his family, so he puts up with it, and routinely bends over backwards for her to keep peace. Unfortunately, as a result, her attitude and unapologetically poor behaviour tends to bleed into our relationship.

Regardless of whats happened, theyre cool with each other in the end. So, while he is not cross with her, and I have forgiven her for things in the past, I am not pleased with how he allows himself to be treated. If they were dating, I might have described him as ""completely whipped"". 

Now there'll be a wedding, and we aren't sure what to do. He doesnt want to upset me, but he would like her there, as they have known each other for quite a while, she is/has been one of the most important people in his life, he doesnt want to start drama, and she could be there with the kids.

While I also think it would be nice to have her with kids there, and I respect the role she plays in his life, I feel that because of the pain she has caused, I have no desire to share our special day with her. But because my fiance is not altogether bothered by her and defends her actions to me, I am basically just mad at her for him.

I plan to only have one wedding and dont want it to be something i think back on and feel upset about, as I do with many of my other moments shared with her. 

Overall, the issue of course is that it will be fiances wedding day, and he is allowed to have friends there as he pleases. However it is also my wedding day, and i would prefer to avoid having people there that I dont get along with, and have never gotten along with. 

He is saying that i should treat her as another one of his pals and just suck it up for one day.

 I am trying really hard to avoid seeming like jealousy plays a part, as I would naturally be on edge and defensive of anybody who is just plain mean to my fiance.

I also don't want to evil stepmother this and tell his kids that their mom cant come.

c0vdwi	2019-06-15 09:04:23		WIBTA if I told my mom she needs to train her dog or get rid of it	"A few months ago my mom got a puppy, it's a Pomeranian, French Bulldog cross, supposedly a circus dog, so it has a stupid amount of energy. My mom also didnt do any research before getting this dog, she assumed it will calm down in the future, the vet said otherwise, this dog will stay hyper af the rest of its life. We also have 2 cats that are just trying to live their lives in peace.

So my mom will barely scold the dog whenever is does something wrong, and I can clearly see that whatever vague attempt my mom has made, has had no effect on the dog. This dog constantly tears up nearly anything left on the floor, doesnt touch the furniture though, chases the cats around and barks at them, and a number of other things; fortunately after weeks, the dog has stopped pissing and shitting on the carpets. My mom will leave the dog in the kennel whenever she theres no one home to watch it, or when she cannot directly keep an eye on the dog, and will always have the dog on a leash, to me this seems like my mom doesnt actually trust  dog. 

If you're wondering why I dont help with the training, its cause I'm a student, have a part time job, and am allergic (will break out into hives on contact with the dog, not immediately, but within an hour). So it's difficult for me to be around the dog, while my mom only works one day a week.

Honestly I'm mostly upset that the cats now have to live in fear of this dog that chases them around without being told no.

So WIBTA if I told my mom she needs to either properly train this dog or get rid of it? Or am I just overreacting?"		1	0

c0v9h9	2019-06-15 08:45:07	heyandy42	AITA for not wanting to help my former co-worker who is trying to rebuild his life after being forced to resign due to sexual harassment charges?	"I worked with this guy Andy for five years. He’s arrogant, thinks he’s always right and treats lower-ranked co-workers horribly. He was ‘nice’ to me and our other co-managers, but we all knew how he’d power trip our staff ranked friends. His former co-workers from his previous jobs don’t have a lot of good things to say about him either.

&#x200B;

Suffice to say we were… *not saddened* by his sudden resignation last month over sexual harassment allegations. A newly-hired staff member, Jenny, went straight to head office HR to complain that he told her to meet him at a cafe for a ‘mentoring session’ where he asked questions about her sex life and ‘joked’ that she owes him a kiss if he can get her promoted to a higher position. HR was pissed, called Andy in for a meeting, and the next day he said his goodbyes.

&#x200B;

Andy decided to put up his own business instead of looking for another job. He has been calling some of my co-workers to help him get in touch with our clients who can become his buyers or suppliers, and one of my co-managers mentioned that Andy wants to talk to me and ask if I can introduce him to my client Frank. Frank owns a manufacturing company and Andy is hoping that I can help him negotiate a discount for products he wants to purchase.

&#x200B;

I do not want to do this at all. I have been handling Frank’s account since he became a client of our company eight years ago and I have built a great relationship with him - I don’t want to tarnish my credibility by being associated with Andy. The way I know him, something will piss him off at one point and he will act all high and mighty on Frank’s employees, or God forbid he might even harass them.

&#x200B;

Yesterday Andy called me but I didn’t answer because I was expecting that he would ask me to introduce him to Frank. When I told my co-workers about this, they told me that I maybe should consider helping Andy, and that two of our other co-workers have already introduced him to their clients.

&#x200B;

They said that while Andy was an asshole when we worked with him, he is now a man who is trying to build a livelihood to support his young children, and the kids should not be punished for their father’s wrongdoings. They also said that we should give Andy a chance, maybe he has learned his lesson and is trying to become a better person. Another friend was concerned about the fact that I still had a lot of hate for Andy even though he’s no longer my co-worker and is basically out of my life.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole or are my co-workers just too kind?

&#x200B;

Edit: Holy shit, I was gone for 6 hours and now this is on the front page. I'm grateful to everyone who took the time to weigh in and it's a relief to me that majority think I'm NTA.

&#x200B;

I just want to clear a few things.

&#x200B;

First, I am sure that things happened exactly as Jenny said. Andy did not deny it to HR. He reasoned that he asked questions about sex because the mentoring portion of the 'meeting' was done and they were just chatting as acquaintances. Thankfully HR did not let it slide.

&#x200B;

Second, I'm glad a lot of you pointed out privacy concerns related to banking regulations. I'm sure there are official rules about this, though in my company we often forget these rules because in practice we become quite close to our clients and basically become their friends so it's so easy to call them and say ""Hey, someone is asking if he can buy five tons of pork"" or something like that.

&#x200B;

Lastly, of course I don't know if Andy can or has changed, but before he resigned he was adamant that he did nothing wrong to Jenny and that he's just a victim of #MeToo gone too far. And that's not very encouraging."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c0v9fg	2019-06-15 08:44:53		AITA for not thinking to invite my dwarf friend to a theme park trip?	"So, I recently got my very first car, and me and my friends started suggesting road trips we could now do. One of us joked about the episode in The Inbetweeners where Jay passes his driving test and they all go to a theme park (and it's a disaster). We all liked the idea and agreed it would be a great first trip, since it's one of those places that has been previously inconvenient to ever travel to without a car.

One of my friends (I'll call him Tom) wasn't there when we were having this discussion, and it occurred to me that he wouldn't be interested in coming, since he is only 4 feet tall (maybe even shorter) and probably won't be able to get on any of the rides. I distinctly remember him saying one time that he hated going to theme parks with his family, because he was always left looking after everyone's stuff while they went on all the cool rides. I didn't want him to feel bored, so I didn't think to tell him about the trip.

Fast forward to the day of the trip, and I am driving around, picking everyone up along the way. I finally pick up the last person, Jessica, and she immediately asks about Tom. I said I thought he wouldn't want to come, and Jessica gets really mad at me, saying that there's no reason he couldn't come and that she couldn't believe I didn't even ask him. I just said that I knew he hated theme parks, he had told me that. And eventually she accepted that and we went off.

We ended up having a great time. Definitely in ways that wouldn't have worked had Tom been there, with us all going on rides at the same time and so on, and waiting in queues for long periods.

A couple days later, I was with Tom and he asked me how my weekend was. I told him about the trip, and he seemed slightly peeved off at me. He just said something like ""Oh right, cool. Sounds like fun."" I then said ""Yeah, it's a shame that there wasn't any rides you could go on. You would have been bored as hell!"" He just said ""yeah"" and walked off.

He definitely seemed pissed off, but I was just thinking about him feeling like a 5th wheel the whole day, and how much that would suck for him, and how he *told* me he hated theme parks (if that's what he's mad about). AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

We have plans to go out at midday and I decided to get on with sorting our daughters room and put her cot up. This is a task that is months overdue since we moved house.

I work Monday to Friday and my wife, who is a fantastic mother, is a full time Mother to our wonderful Daughter.

My wife had a problem with my approach. I decided to have my breakfast, make a cup of tea and start with some DIY.

In doing this, I ignored my duties as a father and I didn't change our daughter or take her downstairs, leaving my wife to do this.

My intentions we good. I just wanted to get on, so I could finish the chores/DIY, get showered and be ready to go out this afternoon my her parents. 

Our daughters room is currently being used as storage since moving house and her cot, which she needs, is still in the delivery box downstairs.

I could understand her being annoyed at me if I did this and sat there watching TV, or just went on my phone but I was doing a task neither of us want to do on a Saturday morning.

We have both tried to do tasks together but with a very inquisitive 11 month baby, she needs 100% supervision, which means one to look after her, and one to do DIY, gardening, laying laminate, plastering, painting etc which is something I have done in the last 6 months whilst working full time and trying to be a Husband and Father.

c0uysu	2019-06-15 07:58:09	quailquest	WIBTA if I refuse my step father’s request to walk me down the aisle?	"Some context, I just got engaged to my boyfriend. My biological father died when I was 12 and my mother remarried when I was 13. He and I have conflicting views on a lot of things, but the worst so far has been that I want to walk independently down the aisle for my wedding. 
This has been a discussion point in my family for a while. My parents continually repeat that it hurts my SF’s feelings that I don’t want this and my mom says it’s because I don’t like him. Despite not liking him, the real point of the matter is I hate the whole idea of “giving the bride away” and I’ve always gone against tradition, 
Even if my blood father were alive I still wouldn’t have him walk me down the aisle. 
His blood daughter got married in another state (in the south where he’s from) and he couldn’t attend so he uses this as an excuse to badger me and my mother about me being his last chance to walk someone down the aisle. 

Upon telling my mom about our engagement, she firstly responded with being upset that I, the woman, proposed to him, and then proceeded to text me after the phone call about reconsidering my previous stance because my SF was upset about it and that my decision breaks his heart. I stood by my initial decision saying I would not be changing my mind, this is something I’ve made my mind up on, I love them, but there’s no way I’m doing something I don’t want to do on a day about my relationship not my SF, and if he really wants to give someone away he can walk my brother down the aisle. She then responded and said “that’s fine then. I’ll try to convince him it isn’t because you hate him.” Very clearly trying to further manipulate me. 

TLDR; told my mom I proposed to my boyfriend, she not only responded upset that I broke tradition by asking him, but tried to manipulate me into changing my mind on being walked down the aisle.

I (20f) met my friend Anne (19f) during our first year of university last year, she made me laugh a lot and we had fun together, and we had a nice group with a couple of other girls. She’s always been quite dramatic and quick to get angry, but it’s not really been an issue as myself and our other friends are pretty chill and just help her cool down. 

Fast forward a few months and I still see her everyday at uni and her negativity and anger is really bringing myself and another friend down. When she receives a bad grade she goes mental and complains that all the teachers hate her (when really her work is just sub-par but she won’t admit it), and when I got a job interview for a job that we both applied for she complained that they were stupid for not hiring her as she has so much experience (which may be true, but it wasn’t the experience they wanted). She’s really rude about anyone who doesn’t agree with her and it’s starting to make me upset because I don’t think it’s fair for her to be so mean about people who are just doing their jobs. I try really hard to be a positive person as there is so much negativity around, and she makes it very difficult. 

I’ve been talking to another friend about whether to speak to her about her negativity and anger, as it’s really bringing us all down. But I don’t know whether it would be rude of me or not. What should I do? Would I be an asshole to tell her to calm down?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Well over time his stepmom had a resentment for me because I'm one of those people who are like ""what's yours is yours and what's mine is mine, if you paid for it it's yours and if I paid for it it's mine"". I never take anything without asking, I'd always ask if I could eat something in their fridge or use something that was theirs or that I did not pay for. ALWAYS. One day I come home and find a roll of toilet paper was missing from a bag I had bought. They buy their own packs as well, these were for me and him only, I started buying my own because I felt bad using theirs because they paid money for it and it'd run out quickly because of 6 people in the house using one pack. They would buy a 4-6 pack of TP even though they know they go through a pack every week easy, they never overstock on this necessity even though I am prepared enough to do so (buy a pack of 24-30). Well anyways, I found a roll missing, and I knew they had took it (and they did, they admitted). What had happened was his litter sister did a #2 and they ran out of TP, and thought it'd be ok to take one of mine because they were understocked and ran out and didn't buy more. They didn't ask, and they never told me until days later when I confronted them  I was mad because they didn't ask. I'm one of those people who won't mind letting someone use something if they ask, just as I have done and would do. I suggested instead of taking my TP that I was so cautious of keeping extra of and they aren't, why they didn't just put her in the tub and wash her ass? Or use a washcloth or wet wipe, which they had. They then proceeded to call me the asshole for not letting them steal a roll of my TP for THEIR DAUGHTER, who ofc, is not mine or I take responsibility for. If you're gonna have a family, you should be responsible enough to care for them and have stuff extra in case of emergencies. It is not my responsibility to, and I'm not your storage unit.

So Reddit, AITA for being prepared and stocked, and they weren't, then getting mad over them taking what was mine (not asking) and then not telling me, and in return calling me a bitch for it all? Needless to say I got the fuck out of there a few weeks later."		1	0
c0us1g	2019-06-15 07:28:25		AITA for not refilling my girlfriends gas tank?	"So my girlfriend and I (both 19) have been living together for about a year now, however, because we are young and due to some personal issues she decided to spend some time with her mother that lives out of state. No problem there, however when we were looking for a flight, we had 2 options, buy a cheap ticket out of the airport that is about 200 miles away, or spend about $150 more and get a flight out of our town. We ended up going with the cheaper one, however that would make me miss a day of school that I wouldn't be able to make up to drive her up there. We decided to take her car because hers is much nicer and would handle the pass much better than my would. The day before we made the trip she kept complaining about having to fill her gas tank for the trip, so I offered to pay for half the tank to be nice. The whole trip goes smoothly I go up there drop her off and drive home, in total about 6 hours in the car, and I finish the trip with about 35 miles left in her tank. Fast forward 2 months later, she is still at her mom's house and we were on the phone and she asked whether or not I filled up her tank, to which I responded ""no"", then she got angry at me and I just want to know if I'm the asshole for not filling the tank after the trip."		1	0

c0ursw	2019-06-15 07:27:25	AITA_halfway	AITA for not attending my friend's wedding	"So this happened a couple years back and has been bothering me since but I just wanted to know if IATA in this situation. I've known the Groom for ten years and we were really close. I was ecstatic to learn that he was getting married and asked me to be his groomsman. I had a plus one to the event and everything was fine until Bridezilla saw that I was arguing with my gf (don't remember what) on the phone and decided to revoke my plus one. Her excuse was that she would cause a scene on her wedding (she has done no wrong to Bridezilla) and because they were not close. Naturally I was appalled and upset at this development and tried to deescalate the situation and reassured her that it would not happen but Bridezilla remained unyielding. (Redditors, is it customary/courtesy to let groomsman have a plus one?)

I turned to my friend and ask if he could persuade her but he either didn't try or completely sided with her because they have every right to decide who to invite since its ""their special day"". Granted, that maybe true to some extent but that's how you lose wedding guests as I retorted ""Fine, go have your wedding but I won't be attending then"" to which Bridezilla said not attending will affect my friendship with the groom (aka Ultimatum).

Obviously I did not wish for that to happen but I was now forced to break the news to the gf. I told her everything and as expected, she did not take that well. As I tried to make the best of the situation, I asked her if I could attend the wedding and she outright told me that if I did, it would mean I agreed with them and that would be the end of us (yay another ultimatum). Now this series of events took a toll on me mentally, I broke down for a couple of days after but I still never regret my decision. Ultimately I made the decision to stand my ground and not attend because, its a matter of principle and because of the hypocrisy where the Groom and the Bride expects me to obediently follow their orders because its their wedding, yet they won't yield and inch to resolve an issue that they caused.

At the end of the day, all I wanted was to attend a wedding with my gf and not lose a friend but alas both did not happen. Even after the wedding, I tried being the bigger person and apologized for the situation and hoped that we can still be friends, I have yet to hear a response.

TL;DR - Bridezilla removed my plus one to the wedding for no reason, groom does not back me up (friends for 10 years), gives me the ""Bro's before Ho's"" speech but does not see the hypocrisy in not backing me up. Told gf the situation and asked if I could go without her and she also told me it would end our relationship. Stuck in a rock and a hard place but ultimately chose not to go and have not spoken since."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I live in a non-air conditioned low rise above a bar, and next to a brewery/bar; I need to sleep with my windows open because of the lack of AC. The last few nights, a couple has taken to having sex in the alleyway between the building and the brewery. This alleyway is owned by the brewery and hold their dumpsters - it’s also locked from the outside and only accessible to staff of both bars. Either someone is forgetting to lock the alleyway, or more likely it’s members of staff. 

Would I be the asshole if I spoke to the manager(s) of these establishment about this?

c0unbm	2019-06-15 07:08:47		AITA for ghosting this girl and her dysfunctional family?	"3 years ago I (female) met this girl in college and we became friends. As we grew closer, I met her family and started to see her true personality. Her family is basically crazy. They consist of her siblings; 3 brothers and 1 sister and they lost their mom back in 2013. They have this weird way of communicating and are very mean and abrasive. The girl I befriended is the same way; very mean, emotionally detached, extremely secretive and private, and she throws tantrums. She was not like this when I first met her. 

When I observed this behavior, I initially contributed this to her losing her mother and gave her a break. However, a year into our friendship, she was becoming hard to deal with. She was very critical of me and constantly hurt my feelings (I’m pretty sensitive), but didn’t say anything because a part of me pitied her. At a bad time in my life, I decided to suddenly stop dealing with her because she was so negative and unsupportive, and I felt like I didn’t need that around me. I didn’t tell her why, I just stopped talking to her. In retrospect, I wish I would’ve said something. Months later we reconnected and started hanging out again. After a few months, I told her why I stopped talking to her before and that nothing had really changed, so we went our separate ways. That was over a year ago. 

While preparing for the MCAT, I decided to reach out to her this past February to see if she wanted to study considering we always did very well together and she agreed. When we met up to study, I noticed she was hiding a pregnant belly and she told me that the father was in the army and that she didn’t know how she was going to handle a baby. She didn’t tell me a lot about the baby father only that she met him at a grocery store, he’s in the army, and that he is deployed. She wouldn’t tell me his name or what he looked like. During our entire time studying (4 months), she convinced me of this. 

4 1/2 months later, tonight, I found out she has been lying this entire time. The baby father is one of our professors who recently got married. I’m very disappointed in her, not only because of her choices but that she made up such a huge elaborate lie and led me to believe it’s true. I found out tonight via her sister who has been talking down about her for getting pregnant. When I told the sister I was upset and disappointed, she got mad at me and said I have no right to judge her and that “shit happens”. This whole situation is confusing me; the wishy washy family, the lies, it’s too much and I don’t ever want to speak to any of them again. Considering what I’ve experienced with them, I don’t even want to say anything to them, I just want to never return to their house or their lives. AITA?"		1	0
c0umzr	2019-06-15 07:07:21	assureattempt	AITA for refusing to lie to my family about drinking underage?	"Please note this happened quite awhile ago. I'm well over legal drinking age now.

When I first went to college I was pretty excited about all the drinking and parties like all freshmen are. My grandparents and some of my aunts seemed to be under the delusion I was a ""good girl"" who wouldn't get involved in stuff like that. This is probably because in high school I stayed out of drugs and underage drinking parties but come on, everyone knows there's about zero adherence to drinking laws amongst college freshmen. My parents seemed to be aware if this and took an attitude of ""We're joy going to endorse you drinking underage but if you do and aren't getting in trouble or driving drunk that's not really a problem, at least please don't brag about it to family.""

Well I went and sure enough I did a lot of drinking. When I was visiting home I went to a family meetup. My parents knew I had done some drinking, I told them I wouldn't brag about it but I wasn't going to lie if it was brought up.

Well there I was talking to my grandmother and an aunt about school and what I was doing. At one point then my grandmother said ""So you're being good? Not getting into trouble or drinking or drugs?"" I just replied""uh no I have gone to parties and drank there. Basically everyone at my college does."" (Truth. This is a stereotypical state university ""party school"".) She seemed shocked and my aunt made a sigh of disgust. My parents were nearby and overheard.

Interestingly my parents split on this, my mom later said I should've just lied and avoided it, my dad meanwhile said it was ridiculous to expect a college freshman to not be drinking and they should've known better and not asked if they wouldn't approve. So who's right?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c0umz2	2019-06-15 07:07:17		AITA for being mad that my bf ditched me?	"Okay, so I’m going to try to make this post as unbiased as possible, but I’m actually still pretty upset about this. 

So my(21F) boyfriend (24M) and I went shopping a couple of weeks ago at a mall that’s about 45 minutes away from our homes. When we got there, we almost immediately started fighting and we both said some pretty stupid things to each other. This was our first little date together after about a week of not hanging out because we were upset with each other & it was clear neither of us were completely over it. I felt my eyes begin to tear up and I started walking away from him. He followed me , still trying to argue so I turned around I told him to just leave. He rolled his eyes at me and laughed, further angering me, so I told him again to just leave. He then turned around and walked to the car. I found a bench to sit on and I say there trying to collect myself when I saw him drive past me. I was honestly pretty shocked that he would leave even though he’s done it in the past (stupid me, I know).  Part of me thought he’d drive around the block a couple of times and then call me so I could get in the car and go home with him, but he didn’t. He drove all the way home, then called a buddy of his, picked him up, and they went to eat dinner and watch a movie. 
I waited on the bench for him to come back for an hour. I called him several times, but all of my calls were ignored. Eventually I ordered an Uber and paid $45 for a ride home. 
The only contact I got from him that night was a text around midnight that just said “goodnight.”

Do I have a right to be angry, even though I told him to leave? My feelings are beyond hurt, I truly thought he would come back for me once I saw him drive away, but he never did. I’m shocked that he could go about his evening and make plans without a care in the world about where I was or if I was safe."	Asshole	1	0

I just went to pick my sister and her friend up not too long ago. They were blackout drunk and it was 1 am when I went to get them. I had my beats that my girlfriend actually owns in the backseat of my two door car because I use the gym daily. When my sister and her friend got into the car her friend pushed them to the ground and stepped on them multiple times breaking them. I then told the girl calmly that she just broke my beats and she looked at me and said “no I didn’t.” She repeated this after I even showed her the broken beats. Given, they are both totally sloshed but I can’t afford new beats. I’m saving up for a nest egg for when I’m back at college (I play a college sport and don’t have the time to work while I’m there) but I do work now. I would like to talk to her step dad who is a surgeon (I know him personally though a common hobby we have, we have spoken many times and he has even helped me with sports related injuries before even when other places wouldn’t take me because of my insurance/ he has MONEY). All of that being said, I just feel...rude(?) asking if anything can be done to replace the beats. My girlfriend is now mad her beats she was letting me use are broken.

c0uixf	2019-06-15 06:50:36	Shitsituation1234	AITA For trying to “violate my wife’s bodily autonomy”?	"My wife has always been insecure about her body image. It never made sense to me since she’s incredibly attractive, but the human mind is weird I guess, and all I can do is try to be supportive and encourage her to attend therapy.

Recently her therapist brought up the topic of cosmetic surgery. Obviously I was not there to know exactly how they suggested this, but the end result is that my wife wants to get breast implants, lip augmentation, and is also considering a bunch of other procedures.

As I say I’ve tried to be supportive, but the idea of this honestly upsets me. I’m not attracted, at all, to women who get cosmetic surgery. It’s fake, it doesn’t feel real, and the whole thing is so vain. 

So I told my wife how I felt, and that if she goes ahead with this I’m worried it would end our relationship because it would kill our sex life since it would be a serious “turn off” for me.

She blew up at me for not being supportive, and trying to use emotional blackmail to “violate her bodily autonomy.”

I’m just being honest. I can’t support something that seriously disgusts me. I’m not religious or anything, I just can’t support cosmetic surgery and I’m not attracted to women that get it.

c0uiro	2019-06-15 06:49:55	kai625	AITA for using the parking pass all the time?	"Hello, I’m on mobile so please ignore my terrible formatting. 

I recently moved in with a friend in an apartment building, and when we signed the lease we agreed that the parking pass would be used for my car because my roommate’s car wouldn’t be available until about September. At that time, she intended to buy a second pass (an additional $35 per month), of which I offered to split the cost for. Everything else, save for pet rent, we agreed to split right down the middle, but I’ve also bought groceries, cleaning supplies, & provided basic toiletries (towels, toilet paper, paper towel, soap). Since then, my roommate’s car has become available for her to have/use. However, there is a waiting list for the pass itself, which is absurd because there is plenty of parking space in the lot, but they don’t have physical passes. 

I feel it is important to mention that I also moved into the apartment physically about a week after she did due to some family circumstances. I have also been trying to arrange things for my work, but I have been home most of the past few weeks. She works part time at two businesses. Our area is also notoriously bad for finding parking at night also, and, if she were to park in the designated parking lot, the vehicle without a pass would be towed. 

That out of the way, she worked today from eleven or twelve until six or so. From there, she went somewhere else (a friend’s house, a date, I don’t pry because I have my own stuff going on), and she didn’t come to the area until almost eleven. She has also been in another part of the state since Tuesday and only returned this morning to get ready for work. At that point, she texted me to complain that there wasn’t any parking. I offered to walk down and help her look around for suitable parking, & that’s when the underhanded insults started. Most notably, her Snapchat stated that “people who don’t do shit all day and don’t go anywhere have the fucking passes” (granted, this was not directly at me, but felt a bit rude and directed at me because I’ve been struggling with my work as they transfer me over to a new system & don’t have me officially “hired” so it’s not like I can go in, and I haven’t been anywhere because I’m down to an emergency twenty dollars & trying to save gas). There were also a number of passive aggressive texts in which she responded to my texts with a shrugging emoji or, at one point, “whatever. It’s not your problem. You have a pass (shrug) I don’t”

I have two much elder sisters, one (27) who has her own house which she typically leaves empty on the weekends and another sister (30) who claimed that space for this particular weekend. 

My boyfriend and I were offered the space last weekend which was lovely just to be around him in a personal environment but I had my period and felt absolutely shitty so we left early and didn’t really get to enjoy the space as much as we would’ve liked.

My boyfriend suggest I ask my elder sister (30)  for a few hours tonight at the house, I knew my sister was going to be there because she’d asked to have this weekend alone so I did feel rude texting her to see if she’d leave for a bit but I just assumed shed be understanding and maybe consider going out for a couple of hours while we occupy the place.

My sister (30) completely went off at me and was really upset I put my boyfriend before her, she’s told me I’ve ruined her day, I’ve been really inconsiderate and just made me feel really bad for asking for a few hours.

I now feel awkward like I’ve committed a crime by asking her and in a way feel kinda pissed that she couldn’t spare a few hours in the weekend given the circumstances of my boyfriend and I."	Asshole	1	0

c0uesj	2019-06-15 06:33:52	PotatoPapyrus	Aita for putting up with my bullies?	"On mobile, long time lurker, spelling, format.

P.s, this thread mentions threats of violence, but I can't take it out because then it would just be a story of me getting bullied, if you dont like that, then stop reading now, now on with the story!

So for some backstory, I have been bullied for many years by multiple people. This makes me have very low self esteem and causes me to bottle up my feelings, but when they come out, crazy shit happen. Plus, anger issues!

So I'm in my final class for the day watching the movie and multiple kids, (the bullies) were talking very loudly, so I politely ask them to be a bit quieter. But they just say, ""but your also talking!"" Which is really triggering, but I try to keep it cool trying not to escalate the situation. So I just say, ""but your talking louder and its disrupting everyone."" ""Well yeah, but I dont see anyone else complaining, do you?""  Other bully replies, ""yeah, so why dont you stick your bitch ass nose in someone else's buisness."" Now I was starting to get very mad (like, wanting to punch someone mad,) so I asked the teacher to take a little walk around the school. She said yes and it was calming. But when I came back, one of the bullies was holding my phone, and when she saw me, she just dropped it to the floor.

I just picked it up and asked her what she was doing with it. She only replied with, ""I wasnt even touching it, why are you so mad?"" I just calmly said, no one likes your horseshit that you call lies, just tell me what you were doing and everything will be alright. Then one of the bullies said this, ""no one even likes you, you fucking nobody so why do you even care?""

c0uelu	2019-06-15 06:33:09	A2112A	AITA because I don't want to meet my Dad's new gf?	"So my(21F) life has been a sad lil rollercoaster so far, as my mother passed away a few months ago. I'm not great with change so this hurts a lot. My parents didn't want us kids to know that anything was the matter so they never fought in front of us, but they've had their fair share of fights, but my Dad said that they've been separated for a year. They were still living together until the last few months where my mother left to go live with her mom as she could take better care of her. My Dad would still visit almost every day for an hour or two so that my siblings could see her and he would hang in the room with her.

After she passed though, he immediately started seeing another woman. I feel like even thou they were separated, thats still decades of marriage and he could have waited Like 6 months to be respectful. He's head over heels for her, and I've met her once before when she was just a friend (or so I was told) and she seems nice, Ill give her that. But it bothers me that he jumped into a relationship so quickly, and that she was okay with that too. 

Also the fact that he's okay with remodeling the house for her, but not when his family has been asking for years. And the fact that he spends the nights at her place leaving my siblings 18 and 12 by themselves. I'm really confused though becuz my friends are on my side (but of course they are, they're my friends), but some family members that my Dad told are on his side. I have no issue with anyone speaking to her, but I refuse too."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c0ucea	2019-06-15 06:24:52	throwawayacc0002	AITA for not asking to take my dad to the clinic?	"My dad had to go to the clinic to treat an infection in his right foot. He didn't ask anyone to take him to the clinic (and no one had planned to accompany him per his knowledge), so my mom decided to accompany him to the clinic even though she didn't let him know in advance that she will be going with him. I met him this morning before he left, but didn't ask him about his infection because of me being afraid to start any conversation with him (past trauma and fear from him physically abusing me as a child). Our typical conversation is almost always similar to having a very short/serious talk with him starting it and me ending it, nothing too long or friendly. My mother was busy, so by the time my mom was prepared to go out my dad had already left the house for the clinic.

After some time, he came back and scolded my mom because no one thought of taking him for a ride to the clinic because of the pain in his foot and how uncomfortable it was to drive the car all the way. After he went to sleep, my mom called me a child and irresponsible for not offering to take him to the clinic knowing his pain even though she is aware of the relationship between me and my dad. She did not budge from her opinion, even though I told her that I wouldn't say no if he just asked a simple request from me to take him to the clinic. My mom couldn't tell him that she wanted to go out with him because of my dad's anger/temper.

Is my mother right in calling me irresponsible/an asshole for not asking to take my dad to the clinic, even when she is aware that my dad never asked me to take him to the clinic and me having communication issues and trauma related to him? Is there some semblance of familial duty that I am not aware of?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c0ubeb	2019-06-15 06:21:14	AskingToughQs	AITA for playing one handed in a computer game versus my friend?	"I was playing a computer game with my friend who we'll call Rick, and our match was observed by another friend who we'll call Kyle. 


I was playing against Rick, who is a good deal worse than me at the game. I thought to make things more challenging that I'd handicap myself by playing one handed, mouse only, and make it a more even match. I ended up winning the match and it was very evident that I was playing far more slower than I usually do because my actions per minute (APM) was more than half of what it usually is. 


My friend, who was observing the game, Kyle, brought up the game a few weeks after it had been played. He told me that was unfriendly and more or less poor sportsmanship by me. He didn't know I was playing one handed. He did say that by playing so slowly I was basically telling Rick that he wasn't worth my best and that I didn't even need to try and that was bad conduct of me.


Now, my intent wasn't to make Rick feel bad. I didn't want to do the equivalent of like hopping on one leg for an entire 1-on-1 soccer match. I did know that I could probably just play more relaxed and wanted the game to be more even and challenging.


Am I the asshole?

Edit: To answer some of the questions in the thread to clarify:

This was done entirely online. Rick did not know I was playing one-handed, nor did Kyle. They both just know I played very slowly, so maybe this isn't correctly titled. He did notice I was playing slowly because at the end of a game it shows a players' average actions per minute (APM). This was done for practice to help Rick improve since he doesn't usually play the game and was preparing for a beginner oriented league, so basically a practice game."	Asshole	0	0
c0ubdg	2019-06-15 06:21:08	saddad1234567	AITA for dating someone (almost) my daughter's age?	"My (now ex) wife divorced me about a year ago. We had been married for over 20 years. She had no interest in marriage counselling and it was out of the blue. Obviously I wanted to work through it, but since she wasn't willing to try, I went ahead and tried to have an amicable divorce. We have 3 kids together (20M, 22F, 25F). We're both in our mid 50s.

Since then I've started dating a 27 year old coworker. It's gotten very serious very quickly. Both of my daughters think I'm an asshole and I'm being extremely insensitive to my ex-wife for not only jumping head first into a serious relationship so soon after our divorce, but also dating someone so much younger. They've both cut contact and made no secret that they think I'm a creep for dating someone almost as young as them. Only my son is being supportive of me trying to move on.

Personally I don't think I've done anything wrong. My wife is the one that wanted the divorce, and while the age gap is big, she's also a consenting adult... If she was 20 I'd understand and think it was inappropriate. But 27? Come on.

c0uayd	2019-06-15 06:19:39	dipeanutx	AITA for smoking weed into my own apartment while my roomie’s mom is here to visit.	"I’ll try to make this brief, and sorry if there’s any misspellings.
I live in Mexico (by the south) with my roomie (25F) and my boyfriend. The three of us share the apartment expenses, such as rent and bills, me and my boyfriend smoke weed every night before we go to sleep, now we don’t do it in the living room because of my carpet and my couch so we always smoke inside my room, last week my roomie’s mom came to visit her and she’s staying with us, before she came my roomie told us not to smoke at all not even in our room since the smell bothers her mom and she does not want her mom to be nagging about it. 

After 8 days of having her mom at our apartment. We’ve decided to smoke today in my room in a small pipe, we covered the door and I put some aromatic candles and we smoked facing my balcony (that has no connection to her room at all) and she just sent me a message calling me an asshole since her mom somehow “smelled” and thinks it’s very inappropriate that I couldn’t respect what she asked me for. 
If it’s about respect her mom has been leaving a mess everywhere she goes my kitchen, my living room, my bathroom she’s super messy and dirty and she has been eating my food.

But honestly AITA here?

Edit: Good Morning everyone!!! Thanks for everyone response, the mom is not allergic to the smoke, but yes, here in Mexico is very much stigmatized for a lot of families. I do understand that the one that has to deal with her is my roomie. But she did told me this morning after I apologize that the smell wasn’t even that strong she could even tell until her mom mention it. The thing is that before I get home from work she saw one of my small pipes (hidden I don’t know how she saw it) and she was just on the lookout for the smell so she can start nagging my roommate. Bad luck for me that was the day I decided to smoke a little because I had cramps that were actually very painful lol. I still apologized and I guess we’re now “ok”"	Asshole	0	0
c0uato	2019-06-15 06:19:14	smilingpig67	AITA for getting angry at someone looking for his package?	"My buzzer went off the other day. Not expecting anyone, I assumed it was UPS trying to get into the mailroom. But when I answered, it wasn't a deliveryman but someone explaining that I had received a package of his so he would appreciate it if I could give it to him. I had no idea what he was talking about; I went downstairs.

Apparently, his friend mailed him a package, but mistakenly put MY address as the delivery address, and he was trying to retrieve it. I told him I didn't get a package, but he showed a picture of his package and a ""DELIVERED"" notification from UPS. I took him to the mailroom and even opened up my mailbox to show him that no such package existed. I got irritated because the conversation wasn't going anywhere, but he was adamant that his package was somewhere in the building. I told him I was busy and removed myself.

Around 30 minutes later, the buzzer rang again. I knew it was probably the same guy so I tried to ignore it, but he persisted so I answered the buzzer to hear him say that it was really important that he gets this package and that he would really appreciate it if I could give it to him. If it's not obvious, he had already decided that I had taken his package and was trying to keep it from him.

I went downstairs again, and he just kept showing me his UPS picture while asking where it was. After some back and forth, I started raising my voice. And he went ""hey man calm down, calm down, here, sit down, sit down here let's talk"". This completely set me off, because I found it patronizing and felt like he was in no position to tell me to sit down and chill. I started cussing and yelling loudly at him, saying that I have nothing to do with his stupid friend's mistake, and told him to fuck off.

And then two hours later, I heard the buzzer again, but it was a different voice, which caught me off guard. The voice explained that ""the owners of the package would really appreciate it if you could give it back to them"". After internally losing my shit, I stormed downstairs to see this other guy. I asked him what the hell he wanted, which intimidated him a little. He explained that he was just a ""messenger"" and that there was no need for me to get mad at him, so I told him to fuck off. The buzzer rang again an hour later.

Only this time, it was the UPS man. I realized that this must be the package that those other guys were looking for. Upon inspecting the package, it said ""NEXT DAY AIR MAIL"", and then I felt bad because it must have been important for it to have been sent this urgently. I figured that they would come back and get it, so I left it at that.

The next day, the package was still there, so I thought to call the number written above my address. But the number sent me to a conference calling service and asked me for a PIN. Very odd, and now sketchy. This was two weeks ago, and the package is still there. So am I the asshole for getting angry?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c0ua2j	2019-06-15 06:16:39	WIBTAnus	WIBTA If I break it off with a long time friend?	"I'm beginning to contemplate breaking it off with my friend. We'll call him Jake. I want to preface this that at this point I've been considering this for 5 or so months and I have made a good effort to want to continue the friendship.

Background: Jake and I have been friends for around 12 years now. I have largely been his support structure because his parents are separated. His mother a sex worker and his father a cocaine addled semi truck driver (who is never around as a result). We are in our late 20s Early 30s and the last 10 years have been a struggle for numerous reasons as we both attempt to complete college. Jake was 30 before getting his driver's license, and I have been his chauffeur for the majority of that time, and if I'm being sincere and honest I was always very happy to help. In recent years though the friendship has really soured for me. His social skills are not the best for people he isn't comfortable with. In fact he has crippling anxiety, to the degree that he has failed his mandatory public speech courses thrice, and a biology lab once due to  being unwilling to discuss a matter of 7 points with his professor. Had he done so, he probably would have passed the course. It takes immense effort to get him to handle his shit, not because he doesn't have a desire to better himself, but because his social skills are so diminished. At times, we fight as people do but lately its just felt like both of us are in a rush to be as hurtful to the other in our discourse. Granted, I try to act with restraint but he always escalates by saying inflammatory crap. This relationship to me, feels like textbook toxic masculinity, and I'm exhausted of it. In the last 3 years or so, I've noticed his patience in our daily goings on to have greatly diminished, usually when we are playing video games together. It makes me not even want to hang out with him. Finally, he's extremely flaky. Not to me exclusively, but when we try to go have brunch with our other friends, or go grab a beer he's fast to disappear right around when its time to pick him up. 

I'm just kinda done. I don't intend to talk to or confront him about this. While I understand some of you might argue that I owe it to him, he doesn't deal with confrontation well, and while I don't fear for my safety or anything I don't think doing so will be even remotely productive to the end effect of our friendship improving. I'm just looking to see if its reasonable for me to walk away from this I think I have been good to this person over the years, and I'm ready to not have him in my life anymore."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c0u93i	2019-06-15 06:13:08	doorbuster126	AITA for not replacing my friend's door?	"One of my friends locked herself out of her room the other night. I was alerted to this fact by the sound of her kicking the door when I was in another friend's room (I don't live there, I was pet-sitting). The friend who was locked out asked if I could get it open, since I know how to pick locks and had done the same thing for her a year ago.

I asked her for two Bobby pins, and she handed me a butter knife. I know how to open a door with that, but the way her door was situated, I needed to remove the jamb. In the process, it cracked some, but was still in one piece. I got the knife in position and asked her to lean on the door to get it to open. She kicked it full force again, which put a hole in the door. With the door now open, I was putting the jamb back in place, but the crack went all the way through and it's in two pieces.

The landlord did an inspection the next day and told my friend it would be $100 to repair or she could do it herself. My friend is pissed at me and wants me to pay the full $100. I told her I wouldn't because 1) to replace the door and jamb is about $60; 2) I told her to lean on the door, not kick it; and 3) she had been kicking the door before I was involved.

I told her I would pay for the jamb, because that was my fault, but I really don't think that I should have to pay her landlord. She's requested the money on two different cash apps, and I've denied the requests. She took the issue into a group chat (which I didn't really appreciate). One of our friends thinks I should pay fully, a few think I should pay half, a few think I'm fine paying just the jamb, and one told me I'm being more than generous paying for the jamb since it was my friend's fault she was locked out. Most have said regardless, we shouldn't be paying $100 when we can do it ourselves for $60. With most of our mutuals falling in the middle, I was hoping for opinions from strangers.

One of the leads though, recommended that we have a get-together to know each other more before this new location opens. We've all met before and we all know each other so another get-together sounds nice, right? She suggests we get something to eat, throw a barbeque, bowling and other stuff. 

I'm totally down for the barbeque and I post in the groupchat how I'd gladly bring some booze! The manager is also on this groupchat and he's a pretty nice guy; he most definitely does not care that we drink on our time off. But the same lead who suggests a get-together was saying how its not work appropriate to bring alcohol. 

She goes on about how it doesnt reflect well upon the other leads and the manager to have alcohol at a barbeque. Is she right?

At about 1am I start getting mad. I tell him we have plans tomorrow, wrap it  up. I go brush my teeth and return. He's still playing. I tell him directly that I'm mad, it's late, go to bed(TV and console are in our room). He plays another round and chats with his friends.

Finally he comes to bed at 1:45ish and asks me why I'm upset. I tell him again that we have plans tomorrow. That I know if he stays up late he will be a dick in the morning, and that at this point I'm pissed that he has completely ignored me telling him that fucking mad and want him to come to bed. Those were my exact words to him and he ignored me completely. 

He made an argument that ""he only does this occasionally"" and made it sound like I was being unreasonable for wanting him to end his thing early.

(About 17 hours from where we live)  We had planned to stop in our hometown the night before since it was on the way and it would shave 3 hours off of the trip.  I was going to be the driver the entire way to Texas and we were going to split the gas money.  He can't leave before Sunday night because some other friends are visiting him from Kansas and he can't bail on them.

Well after these plans were made my parents invited me over Saturday to spend some time with them since I barely see them, it's father's day, and one of my dad's friends died in a pretty brutal way last week.  Since my parents still live in my hometown, I had the idea to just drive down to visit my family then meet up with my friend on Monday morning to carpool the rest of the way to Texas.

When I brought this up he got pretty mad. See, we're both pretty broke, but had managed to scrounge the money for the trip. Not carpooling, even for that 3 hour trip (From where we currently live to our hometown) was going to cost him approximately 20 dollars in gas money that he'd not prepared for. (Trust me on the math here.)  As I said before, he can't just come down with me on Saturday due to his other obligations.  We're taking my car the rest of the way and I'm buying the groceries for the road trip since we decided we didn't want to go out to eat.

Small town right by the ocean with great food/ bakeries. So my mom told me that some of the kids ride boosted boards, if you don’t know they are electric skateboards that go around 20 mph, around town, this was really exciting to me because Casey Neistat’s made me want one for a really long time, so she said that we should get one for me so I could ride around with these kids. It was an obvious and immediate yes from me and I set off finding one used. Fast forward a few days and I found one from the current gen on an app called offerup for about $400 off retail price and it was in pretty good condition. So I took this to my mom and she basically dodged the question do if I could get it or not until the day we had to move for the summer to the town previously mentioned. She basically said that she didn’t trust a used board and once we’re settled up in our new home we would order one. So that’s fine cause at least I get a new board so there’s no surprises. Now we’ve been up here for a bit and I would say we’re settled. I found a boosted stealth, the best board out rn,  for drastically less than retail on eBay. So naturally I’m excited. I’ve been trying to talk to my mom a lot about this but every time that we talked about it she would dodge the question and say I was being repetitive.

I had a friend from high school that I lost touch with in college. She is a very sweet person and would do things like pick me up from the airport or have me for dinner... things like that. 

Anyways, after I graduated, I started to hang out with her again. It was nice to see one of the few people I still talked to from high school. Unfortunately, this happiness didn’t last long. For a graduation present, one of my mom’s good friends gave me $200! However, I went to visit my friend the same day I got the money so I didn’t have time to put it in the bank (should have left it at home). We went out and enjoyed activities in the city. I stayed over at her place and had a great night. When I went home the next day, my money was gone! I asked her if she found it (she didn’t). I wondered it could have been her but I brushed it off thinking that of course I must have lost it or someone stole it while we were out (we’d done a painting class so someone could have taken it while I wasn’t watching my purse).

Scroll a few months into the future... I travel overseas for a trip. My friend offers to pick me up when I get home. I say that’s very kind and ask her if she wants to stay over and we can have a girls night. When I get home she picks me up. I had about 60USD on me. When I got home she helped me unpack and I notice my money was missing. I was quite upset but I was too tired to say anything. I hadn’t checked my wallet since the day before, and I’d been traveling and repacking for my flight, so I didn’t know 100% if she’d taken it. I mentioned it to her after she left and said it was odd that it had happened twice while I was with her, but she would “never” steal from me. 

Still, I was angry and blamed her for both cases. I didn’t see her again, except on her birthday. I decided to try seeing her one more time. I wanted to test her. I put $20 in my car (I never even brought it into her house) and stayed over. The money was gone. Other people were over at her house though and it’s not in the best neighborhood... I have not seen her since. I’ve also avoided talking to her. 

I never upfront called her out or spoke to her about it. She talks to me and always asks me why she never sees me. I sometimes feel like I should tell her why. Maybe it really is a coincidence. I’ve never actually seen her taking money from my purse. AITA for not talking to her about it? She’s been my friend since high school and I feel like she has the right to know.

Exam marks aren’t back yet so they don’t even know for sure if they’re going to their backup schools and I have around a 20 mark margin to drop which basically ensures I’m getting into college. 

Anyways, I was sick of hearing that I was lucky when I’ve been busting my ass off for all years of high school while they’ve been going out and skipping class so today at our lunch I blew up and mentioned how they went to summer school twice and still didn’t get high marks, that they have a job for no reason when they’re not getting into college anyways, and even in the “easy” classes we share I have higher marks than them anyways. 

Surprisingly, the awkward lunch ended and we pretended to act fine afterwards and went to the park but I can still feel the tension. I haven’t said anything back to them whenever they said their snide comments all year but today I blew up. Am I the asshole??"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Her little brother Jason is 15 and is a terrible kid, the kind of kid who plays fortnite, doesn’t respect anyone, always gets in trouble and makes an effort to annoy everyone. Her parents have even considered sending him away to help his behaviour. 

Sarah is always responsible, she helps with her family’s real estate, she’s kind and overall a great person. But her parents seemingly dedicate all of their family activities to Jason, they go to soccer games, they go places that Jason likes and wants to go to. When Sarah wants to go somewhere it takes months before they get around to it. Her parents force her to come to family activities like soccer when she hates it, they do this almost every weekend and it often results in her not being able to come hang out with our group on weekends. When Jason gets in trouble, her parents get mad and after disciplining him, they tend to take their anger out on her.

"My wife and I have been together for 3 and a half years, and she has two children from her first marriage. The two children live with us and go to school in our country, their father lives in another country, and has been giving my wife approximately 900 USD in child support payments every month. The law in our country is that the father is not required to pay child support after their wife has been re-married. I am financially well off enough to pay for my step children's school and home and food, and provide a comfortable livelihood. I asked my wife to stop taking money from her ex-husband, because I feel like she is using another person's money to take care of our family and that bothers me. She said I was being unreasonable and that her ex Husband should continue to pay support until the children turn 18 because it is his obligation, even if we don't need any of his money. my wife is now very mad at me for insisting she stop taking another man's money and using it to finance our family. AITA for asking my wife to stop taking these payments voluntarily.

Edit- Probably relevant, my wife never informed her ex-husband that she is remarried. Also, not in the USA or EU.

Edit2 - Okay based on the replies it seems I am probably the asshole here. I have apologized to my wife now and things are back to normal. how she deals with this financial situation is her business ad not my place to choose. Thanks for the advice everyone it has been very helpful."	Asshole	0	0

I was asked if I could help out a family by letting them move their stuff in my basement because they are getting evicted.  I do know these people and I have been to their place before.   The reason they are getting evicted is because they got a dog and the landlord told them they can't have pets a couple months after they got it.  I'm afraid of fleas and plus I have seen roaches in their apartment before too.  I know they are being forced to move right away, but I just don't want to be responsible for other peoples stuff sitting in my basement.  They are too broke to rent a storage unit and now their family is having to split up among other relatives homes that they know.

c0tx56	2019-06-15 05:32:07	amiabadpersonthrowww	AITA for choosing Dog/BF over family?	"  

Hi all, throw away because I’m shy and afraid of judgement on my actual account.

Some background- I’m(21) currently on my second year of community college, and I’m a single mother of a beautiful baby girl. I work really hard for my own money but its hard find a job that pays a lot, so I currently work minimum wage in retail. I currently live paycheck to paycheck. To take care of my kid, she’s at my grandma’s. I try to see her every 2 weeks or so. I also have a younger brother, who still lives with my mom. Since we grew up really poor, I know our housing conditions aren’t great. For example- there’s constantly dead bugs all over the house, the scent is always musky, and our mother has had issues with drugs. 

Recently, I was discussing my home life with my friends, and some of them accused me of being selfish. Since saving up from my minimum wage job, I’ve finally had the chance to buy the golden retriever puppy of my dreams. He’s super cute and I bought him directly from the breeders. I also pulled from financial aid to buy my 3 year boyfriend an expensive laptop ($1,000). My friends accused me of being financially irresponsible and selfish for not spending that money on my daughter and brother instead. They point out that my dog eats $60 food a week. But I feel like since I had worked so hard for my money- I can use it as I please.

c0twf8	2019-06-15 05:29:20		AITA for wishing not to go to a political rally?	"My (14M) family is very liberal politically, and I am the same, for the most part. However, I do not like to go to rallies -they are crowded, tiresome, and feel like a waste of hours which I could otherwise be enjoying. While not necessarily forced to go, my mother guilt trips me every time I admit my reluctance to go (ie. “Do you not care about democracy?” etc.). This time around, after some back and forth, I was finally allowed to not go, but my mom is heavily disappointed.

My biggest concern is that my values of political agency are being undermined, as I am strongly pushed into liberal beliefs. I have recently decided to become more intellectually independent from my parents, and this semi-undermines the autonomy which I wish to have. To be clear, I am still quite liberal, but I am not as active as the rest of my family. 

My main question hinges on whether I have a moral imperative to be active about my beliefs, or whether I have a right to be lazy if I choose. Do others have the right to pressure me into political activism? AITA?"		1	0
c0tvw1	2019-06-15 05:27:19		AITA: For snapping multiple times at this guy?	"When I was 16, this senior 18, John took me out with his friends. Something bad happened when I was a sophomore . Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.




He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. He always implied that I was attractive enough to fuck but not date.



He would also imply that I'm weird or annoying. When I was 17, I tried talking to him about trouble I was having at school. At first, he was sympathetic but then told me to speak to someone else. Because of what happened I was bullied in school, I tried to talk to him because I was lonely . After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.



That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me.


I blew up at him and blocked him finally. He was messaging me begging for pics, and he now lives with his girlfriend. I feel sick. He recently emailed me saying hey I called him , a waste of space, ugly, a coward, an awful person. 



I want this person to stop contacting me. I feel terrible. I haven't seen him for four years, but he still keeps original photos he took of me as a teenager. I thought he would have stopped when I blew up at him last time. He acts like I'm a bitch cause he says he's just like that and he's never done anything wrong to me. He even said,” i don't deserve all this your saying about me.”


But he's been contacting me when he's in a relationship of almost two years trying to face time or get photos.


One time when I blew up at him, and he left me alone for a couple of months coming back trying to apologize to me then to come on to me sexually then I went off hard on him calling him scum and saying I wish he were dead also, he lives with his girlfriend



Am I a mean person for sending these messages? Does that make me a bad person?"		1	0

We are all homeowners and have our own families. We all moved out of our parents’ house at 18 and have never lived with our parents since.

c0tt5o	2019-06-15 05:17:04	maryye	WIBTA if I won't be a bridesmaid in my cousin's wedding?	"I've never been close to my cousins. They've excluded me my entire life, we don't have each other added on FB/Instagram. I've never been a part of their lil group. **I come from a SUPER family-oriented culture. The sort of culture where family is everything and your cousins are like siblings. Similar to Latinos and Samoans. I legit don't know a single other girl of my culture who isn't close with her cousins, I'm the only one.** This is something that caused me a lot of heartache as a teenager, it really effected my self esteem. I'm grown now and don't go to any family functions, have made my own friend group and moved on. Note: they've never been mean to me. I'm just not a part of their group but the pain comes from the fact that in our culture all cousins are best friends and they just...never included me.

Of all my cousins, I'm on good terms with one ""Aimee"". She's a sweetheart and we've been friendly forever. When she & the cousins all go out somewhere, none of them including her ever invite me, but she's the only one who hangs out one-on-one with me. 

Aimee even referred me to my job too - which I'm thankful for because it pays well and is in my dream field. Plus super competitive, I wouldn't have the job if it wasn't for her. I've expressed my gratitude a million times and shown it as well. 

She just got engaged and is planning her wedding, it's gonna be a huge wedding with a week of events. She asked all the cousins to be bridesmaids. I immediately felt...ugh. I know exactly how it'll go: I'll be the awkward one with no one to talk to, they'll all be best friends with each other and I'll be trying to fit in, I'll feel so awkward for every wedding event and my anxiety will be super high. 

A few days afterwards we talked & I said ""listen, I've confided in you about how the cousins never included me and I feel bad around them. I'm sorry but I really can't participate in the huge wedding ya'll are having. It'll be like 5 days of non-stop anxiety. I'm so, so, so sorry and I love you but I just can't."" Long story short, she's mad. She said ""you're not doing this for them, you're doing this for me"". I said ""I get that, but I'm gonna be around them and you know how they make me feel."" She said ""I've done so much for you, you can't do this for me?"" I said something about how ""it's not like you include me when you're with them, you guys all hang out and I'm always left out"". We went back and forth for a while, and she's mad. 

Note: when another cousin got married last year and asked me to be a bridesmaid, I said ""listen, you're only asking because you have to bc we're cousins, let me spare us both. I'll attend but I don't want to be a bridesmaid."" The cousin was annoyed but idgaf about her anyways. Aimee knew about all this, so it's not out of the blue for her at all.

I know that I'm not, like, legally obligated to be a bridesmaid. I get that. But just on a social etiquette level, am I an asshole for this?"	Asshole	0	0

c0trqy	2019-06-15 05:12:06		AITA for getting angry at my GF for humble bragging about an LSAT score?	"For some context, my girlfriend and I are both studying for the LSAT (Law school admissions test). She has already it and scored an average score of a 160, but she’s retaking it to get a higher score and so far she is succeeding. Her practice tests are above 170 now. I, on the other hand, have recently started studying and am not scoring very well. In fact, around the same place she was the first time. But hearing about her performance makes me feel very defeated and upset. I tell her I don’t want to hear how she does on her practice tests because I know she is doing well and it just makes me feel bad. 

Recently we had a conversation that made me so angry but show thinks I’m TA for it. It’s easiest to input the text convo here. Also for context, we are talking about signing up in advance for the next test date in September if we don’t get the scores we want. 

Me: I’ll sign up for September next week

GF: I’ll sign up too

Me. You know you don’t have to

GF: Not true

Me: Ok. I’m done talking about this with you. I hate how we both know you’re fine and your acting like you’re not. It annoys me so much.

GF: Because literally nothing is guaranteed it is very very possible for me to get a 167 (A great score)

Me: God Forbid

GF: And in that case I would retake

Me: Cuz you’d be so fucked. Whatever, I’m going to bed.

GF: I hate how I can’t talk about this with you. All I do try to do is give you advice, help, and encouragement. But this is a big part of my life too.

Me: Do you really think I want to be hearing you say, “oh I’d be so fucked in the slight chance I get a 167?”
After I consistently score 10 points less. What makes you think I want to hear that?

GF: I never said I was fucked. All I said is that I will retake and I’ll sign up for September

Me: Jesus fuck okay so you didn’t say “fuck” you said you’d have to retake it. God damn it with you and your fucking semantics. Stop texting me I’m going to bed.

Then she got super mad at me about how this was unacceptable and that she didn’t need to devalue her expectations to fit my performance. Honestly I can’t believe her reaction. All I’m saying is I don’t want to hear right now that a 167 is a bad score for her. I’m lamenting all the time about getting in the 150s and she complains about a 167?? And then gets mad at me for saying I don’t want to hear it ONE TIME. AITA?"		1	0

c0trjl	2019-06-15 05:11:20	MrConbon	AITA for asking my ex not to sleep with people?	"So a few days ago my boyfriend and I broke up. He texted me stating that he, “needs a break to figure out his life”. The last month of our relationship was a struggle since he didn’t get this promotion he was working 4 years towards and has been shutting me out. 

I told him I think a break would be good and that I will be here for him whenever he figures his life out. He says he wants us to remain friends since we work together and have mutual friends. 

Since we were on a break I told him that I didn’t feel comfortable with him sleeping with other people on the break. He got insanely angry and yelled at me stating that our relationship is over and I’m being incredibly controlling and manipulating him. 

I felt really bad as I was looking online to see how to handle a break and nearly all sites suggested saying your opinion on seeing other people on a break. He told me that we are broken up and I have no say. I was surprised since he said a break and not a breakup. 

I apologized since I thought we were on a break and not break up. In my opinion a break is like listening to a song and putting on pause. I thought at some point we would get back together since he said he just needed some time alone. 

Now I feel like an asshole for asking him not to sleep with people. If I knew the relationship was completely over I definitely wouldn’t have said that. I feel like this was a miscommunication on our ends. 

TL;DR: boyfriend asked for breakup when I thought he said break. Asked him not to sleep with people."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c0tqpb	2019-06-15 05:08:28		"AITA for ""involving"" a roommate in conflict?"	"I'm currently taking summer classes with Sara, a close friend and roommate. One of our roommates is subleasing her room to a girl I'll call Teresa. 

Us 3 already got off to a bad start. When we came back to campus for the summer, my cleaning supplies were scattered on the floor and my silverwares were in the sink caked with food. Sara noticed some of her food was gone. At this point, we're already annoyed with Teresa but we didn't want to start off on the wrong foot. We wanted to introduce ourselves but Teresa wasn't home, so we decided to write a note introducing ourselves and asked Teresa to keep the temperature within a certain range. 

The next day, Teresa wrote back and said verbatim, ""I'm not sacrificing my comfortability. If you can't afford a raise in utility costs, get a job."" 

In the note, Teresa also said that she will be bringing a dog the next week. Sara was frustrated with this as Teresa never asked for permission (all roommates must sign pet consent) and she is also allergic. We wrote back stating that Sara has allergies. Later, Teresa approached Sara alone and asked her for permission. Sara doesn't like conflict so she gave permission, despite her allergies. Teresa then approached me and asked me the same question. Now, I love dogs and wouldn't mind having one in the house, but I said no out of courtesy to Sara. Sara didn't tell me that she gave her permission, so now I look like a dick since I said no despite not having allergies, but Sara said yes despite having allergies. This is where Teresa starts targeting me specifically.

I should mention Teresa sets the thermostat to 62, which is way below the range we asked her to keep it at. I just raise it back up, and Teresa comes back to set it back down. This prompted Teresa to text Sara, ""Tell Next\_Piece that if she keeps raising the temperature, my dog will overheat. If that happens, I will sue her."" From this point on, whenever Teresa has a problem with me, she'll go to Sara rather than coming to me. As I mentioned, Sara doesn't like conflict so this made her uncomfortable. Another thing that Teresa said in her note was that Sara and I should be ""adults"" and come to her directly rather than communicating with notes. I certainly understand this, except she's doing the exact same thing she is asking us not to do by going to Sara instead of me directly.

Sara and I are close friends and are taking the same classes, so it's inevitable that some of our conversations will be about Teresa. Sara told me later that her mom doesn't want me talking to her about this issue anymore. She said that this is an issue only between me and Teresa. I  was pretty annoyed with this since Teresa bringing the dog (and therefore sparking most of the conflict about temperature) was due to Sara not being direct with Teresa about her allergies, so I blame her for a good chunk of the conflict that we're having with Sara.

So, AITA for ""involving"" Sara in this conflict and wanting to talk about it with her?"		1	0

c0tma8	2019-06-15 04:53:15		AITA for leaving my (at the time) bf for someone else?	I don’t know how long this will be but here it goes. This all happened around 6 months ago but I still find myself wondering if I’m a bad person because of it. I was in a relationship with this guy for over 2 years- and for the most part it was great. We never fought and we really did care about each other, we thought we’d be together forever. But at a certain point something changed- I’m not sure what but we ended up taking “breaks” and I found myself falling out of love with him. Now of course I did not want to acknowledge that it was happening and tried to “fix it.” I think at that point I was just staying with him because I was so dependent on him and afraid of being alone. Then, I met this other guy. I became really good friends with him and would ignore my boyfriend to talk to him. My bf got extremely jealous and would constantly ask if i liked the other guy to which I said no and he even messaged the guy basically telling him to stay away. But then.. I actually did start to fall for the other guy. I tried to fight off those feelings as much as possible but I couldn’t. I stopped ignoring my bf but the love wasn’t there anymore. I wanted someone else and as much as I didn’t want it to happen and ruin my then relationship, there was nothing I could do to stop it. I eventually realized it wasn’t fair for me to stay with him anymore, I couldn’t just stay and have him believe I still loved him when really I wanted someone else, right? And if I’m being completely honest, me and the other guy would flirt all the time and some people would probably consider that cheating. So I broke up with my bf, and it was so incredibly hard to do because I knew how much it would hurt him. I ended up dating the other guy very soon after leaving my bf, probably too soon, and I’m still with him now. I’m very happy in my current relationship but I still feel like I was an asshole to someone who I cared about for 2 years. I probably left out some details, but that’s the main idea of what happened.

Background:
So I am 16 and I work for a resturaunt. I work whenever they need me as it is my summer break and I have nothing better to do. My mother and I have developed a friendship with the owner of the restaurant.

I rarely ask for days off, so I thought that since my family is having a party I should get the day off. Me being super socially awkward didnt say anything didn't say anything, and my mother realized this so she asked for the day of about a month prior. The owner's wife (who help manage the restaurant) said alright and she would mark it on the calendar.

Fast forward 2 weeks and I text to remind her, and she send back a text (in emojis) that makes it seem like she forgot. 

Fast forward again to a few days ago. She said that she thought it was another day and my mother sends a text proving that she said ok to day we wanted.

Now she is saying how that day is super busy and she needs me to help. My mother and I think that we gave her enough time and a reminder so she could schedule someone else. No matter how much she asked we stood our ground and said that I wouldn't be going that day.

c0tjtr	2019-06-15 04:44:32	broskymchoesky	AITA for lying to my friend and saying she’s not difficult to deal with?	"Some context: we both have mental illness located on the bipolar spectrum. My issues are still developing and can’t be categorized, though I’m medicated. Hers, however, are in line with Cyclothymia and she isn’t medicated. As a result, she can sometimes be extremely difficult to deal with. Handling her mood swings and insecurity is extremely draining, especially for someone like me who also struggles with the same issues. 

I told another mutual friend that she’s “an exhausting friend” but I don’t want to abandon her because I’ve been abandoned for similar reasons before... He agreed, saying that from his perspective (neurotypical), she doesn’t have any self-control and is destructive, and that he’d been stressed out from her the entire time the three of us were working on a 2-month group project.

Now today she texts me, upset because someone told her that she was exhausting to be around, and while what I said wasn’t untrue, I still feel fake saying it to her. 

I told her that that was a blanket term for people who were too lazy or uninformed to deal with mental illness, that she was overthinking and was being manic and paranoid, and that If *I* thought she was exhausting, I wouldn’t talk to her. 

I feel awful for lying, mostly because she said she fears everyone sees her that way and they don’t want to say it. I lied through my teeth, but she’s so sensitive I don’t know that I could ever tell her the truth out of fear of how she’d take it. Am I an asshole for wanting to hide the truth? I don’t love her any less than my other friends.

TL;DR: my friend and I both lie on the BP spectrum and I understand it’s a difficult disease to live with. She’s exhausting to be around and everyone knows it. She asked me if I felt that way too, and I lied and said I didn’t feel that way."	Asshole	0	0
c0tijy	2019-06-15 04:40:00		AITA for getting into a relationship with someone overweight in order to get them into better shape	"Hey everybody, I wanted to run an idea by you all, since my friends have been divided on if this is a good way to go about dating. So essentially I figured that I would find a girl who would be considered overweight, but she would have to have a pretty face and a good personality (all according to my standards of course). Then, I would go out with her while also convincing her to go to the gym to work out and diet with me. The goal is for her to eventually slim down and be both beautiful on the inside and out. Now, of course, if she refused to go work out with me then the relationship wouldn’t work and I would find a reason to break up with her. I figured the whole process of getting together and breaking up would be easier than normal considering that she possibly has low self-esteem (I understand this isn’t something to take advantage of but I think it’s good to be honest about the situation and the likelihood of it working). At the end of the day, I think I’m genuinely helping her become a healthier person. 

After running this idea by a couple friends of mine, I was met with...a mixed reaction to say the least. Some said it sounded like a good idea to try out while others called it “unethical” so I wasn’t sure how to feel about the method in general. Thanks for the feedback!"		1	0

c0thaq	2019-06-15 04:35:28		WIBTA if I asked my ex to go to my Nonna's birthday, even though I have a new boyfriend?	"Some background:

No, I am not cheating on my new boyfriend.

My Nonna (great-grandmother) is turning 90 this July. I live in Alberta as does her daughter (my grandma). My Nonna lives in BC and we live in Alberta, so it's quite a trip there. I was with my ex for two years and my Nonna loved him so much. She asks about him all the time and when we were together she was so excited to see him during the holidays and whatnot.

My ex and I broke up amicably. I don't really want to include my Nonna in my personal life and more just want to make her happy since I know that she isn't going to be with us much longer. She doesn't need ""oh, here's new person here, new person here"" blah, blah. I would be lying to her but it would make her happy. However, I don't think it would make boyfriend too happy if I told him that this is what I want to do. I've only been with new boyfriend for three months. Obviously I prioritize my Nonna's happiness over a new boyfriend, but I'm wondering if it were morally corrupt to do this to him. Or tell him that this is what I want to do.

c0th90	2019-06-15 04:35:18		AITA for throwing a pillow at my friend and crying when I get hit with it?	"So I (17M) currently at a sleepover with two people: Person A(17M) and Person B(16nonbinary). Person B is a very jokingly violent person, slapping biting, etc. It's all for laughs, but I think this time was a bit far.

Person A was on my bed and wanted to move to the floor to sleep. He asked for a pillow because the floor was hard. I gave him a nice, big pillow because I love my friends. Person B stands up.

B: No. Don't give him the pillow, he chose to sleep on the floor. Let him learn the consequences of his actions.

This repeats a few times and Person A starts saying to Person B how he only said that so I could give him a pillow and because he felt bad just taking one. I asked B if I could finally give him a pillow and they begrudgingly agreed. I decide to throw the pillow at B as a result to joke. And they grab the pillow and start wailing on me. Their glasses get crooked, their hair goes wild, and they're more violent then I've ever seen them. They throw the pillow at A and warn me to not do that again, and that I almost break their glasses/nose. 

I tried to toss it as light as i could to do as least damage as possible, but the look B gave me brought up old trauma and now I'm sobbing under the covers while A and B are chatting. I can't get B's image out of my head.

Feel free to correct me if there's grammar or wording issues.""

&#x200B;

Me (30yo) , she (25yo) we met at the office we haven't spoke to each other though we see each others everyday 

until one day we use our interior chat tool due to work relate issues and there's a chemical happens while we talk then i've decided to text her privately and then next 2 weeks we almost chat every single day for a man like me who just broke up with ex for almost 6 months i think it's a good chance to see someone else. I'm not guy who started to see someone else as long as split up 

so 6 months i think it's time to move on.

I'm a huge fan of Stand-up so i ask her out for a night out and she says yes without any hesitation i was like hell yeah.

and she mentioned that she lives quite far away from the town she used to take train to the town and take metro to the office though she said it's alright only takes like 50 mins but i know how it feels like as i was lived in a small town and takes an hour to the city so i figure i shoulda tell my dad i need the car for send her back home.

&#x200B;

In that night , it's all good regular chat and dinner and we head to stand up which is hilarious those comedian were damn great. When the show ends we walk a bit and i say to her ""hey why don't you stay here for a bit i'll drive you home"" 

but for some reason she turn it down and said it's alright i can use metro you don't have to do that. However , there's a voice inside my head tells me am i did something wrong?  so there's no point for keep push her so we decided to walk to metro. 

The next day we still text each other and i'm kinda feels like she gets politely seems reluctantly replied my message based on her context. so i decided to ignore her message for a week TO SEE if she's going to refuse ME. 

Then no message from her during this week all of my friends thinks i'm crazy call me idiots , so i've text back and she said it to me : Hey , i will be out of city for a week so I was thinking i should pay you the fare on the night....

&#x200B;

SO AITA for ignore her message for a week?

c0te74	2019-06-15 04:25:09	shyjovi	AITA for going on a trip during my brothers bday and my parents anniversary?	"My friend invited me to go with her to a fancy hotel his weekend, which was when her mom was supposed to get married, but was dumped last minute, so why let the money go to waste? Other friends are coming too and I thought it’d be fun.

To elaborate, I have to watch my brother on weekdays during the summer, and then work on the weekend. Due to my anxiety and fear of being alone, sleeping and staying in the house all day with no human contact makes me panic.

I told my mom about the trip and she said,” that’s on your brothers birthday and our anniversary, probably should talk to dad..” I just said “okay” and that was that. 

Later that day, I talked to my dad and he said “yeah, that sounds like fun!” 
I texted my mom and told her I was going.
She said “k”... uh oh.
I asked her what was wrong and she said, “nothing, it’s just a big weekend”. 

An hour later she sends me this long paragraph about how her family doesn’t care about her feelings and anything important to her. Keep in mind, we were in the same house. I wanted to talk to her but got scared. She gets irritated easily. For the past 2 days she didn’t talk to me and ignored me. An hour ago I tried talking to her and she was pushing me away and when I told her that I didn’t mean to make her feel bad and that I felt trapped in the house she said,“whatever, doesn’t matter.” I made more attempts to talk but was met with “mhm” I just sat in silence for a few seconds and stood up, said “goodnight momma” , again met with “mhm” and left.  I can’t stop crying, I hate making her upset. 

Am I the asshole for going on this trip?

c0tcat	2019-06-15 04:18:36		AITA ending relations with my sister	"Ended relations with sister's family

My sister is a good person who's lived a difficult life but for years I've had to deal with her toxic husband on occasion. Her husband is an asshole - never respected my father. Mamma's boy. Expects me to treat him with extra reverence because he's older than me (stupid Indian culture -- he can simply fuck off). I have been NC with him most of my life and he simply gives me the cold shoulder when I'm around. I think he has lots of mental issues. My sister keeps talking about the drama in her life. Either some issue with the kids, or some issue with her job, or some shit her husband said. Recently her husband tried to tell through her if I don't talk to him I can't talk to the kids.  In response, I told my sister I'm ending relations with her toxic family and the kids and they've been removed from my will and instead it's all going to charity. I also told her not to contact me again and blocked her number. Even my father is sick of this shit.  Note that the issue is not with my sister or kids, but the family she married into. She clearly married a person no one in my family likes but tolerates. But I'm tired of always listening to her drama - it's not my family why should I listen to this bullshit. We're not even close. She moved away when I was young and it's been decades since we reconnected. Only occasionally keep contact and visit. But now I've severed the relationship completely. She's not worth her family drama and I live a great life. I'm also not close to anyone except people at work and have been alone all my life. I don't need other people's bullshit in my life and perfectly happy to be alone. Normally I would not ask this question, but since my sister is good and kids are obviously innocent, AITA for cutting them off my life because the husband is an asshole and the kids are innocent but out of my life because he's trying to use them as leverage (will never let myself be manipulated). Being a loner, it's kind of a relief to know her family is out of my life."	No A-holes here	1	0

She's single too. My friend seems to get annoyed whenever someone else sees him with her and says something like ""wow dude your mom is so hot! Last time I was at his place playing video games I was talking about how I'm single now and said something like ""I totally would be fine dating the MILF who also lives here!""

Partner A(43) and Partner B(42)

A uses a mobile phone a lot. Facebook, news, YouTube, hobbies related sites, you name it. Since I introduced A the wonderful world here on Reddit, it's become even more. 

Earlier this evening, I was doing something on my phone, and it was going on for a while. Not hours, but probably up to 1 hour. 

(FULL DISCLOSURE: I was on Reddit, in an active thread, participating in a discussion.)

Out of nowhere, A snaps at me with ""get off your phone"" or something of the like. To which I reply ""You're on your phone way more than I am, everyday. What's the difference when I'm doing something?"" 

A mutters an ""Ok, fine.""  Seeing as I want A to tell me the reasoning, and reply to my response, I again ask A what's the difference between us both doing the very same thing and why this is an issue for one and not the other. A refused to respond and shuts down, ending the conversation without providing any type of answer. 

I left the house for a weekly function that usually  takes around an hour, after which I returned home. When I settled in, A goes over to a friends house. This is neither previously planned (advised about if it was) nor is it out of character. I've since stretched out on the bed, hanging out with the dog, on Reddit. (I know)

A comes home, into the bedroom, changes into comfortable clothes and asks ""are you mad?"" I reply with ""No."" A is now out in the living room using the mobile phone and I'm still stretched out relaxing. 

This will go on  with minimal interaction and indifference until one of us let's our guard down and drops the cold shoulder.

c0t8na	2019-06-15 04:06:28	jrichardi	AITA for having an huge issue with my Dad trying combine fathers day with my son's 2nd birthday	"I'm on tour tight now but get to be home for a day this week, as well as my brother who is a father. My sons 2nd birthday is the 24th, which I fly home that afternoon again for a few days. 

He does a lot for us, but nothing outside of a regular grandparent. My Dad, and now grandparents are on board, wants to combine fathers day cookout with his 2nd birthday. Mind you he is the one hosting said cookout. He also know we plan ed on his birthday there the day of. It was a Taco Twosday party. 

The wife and I are very unhappy with this. We have the first girl in the family in many decades due to deliver in September, taking away my son and nephews reign of cuteness. We want to make him feel special for his birthday.

 I am very busy and the wife usually takes care scheduling stuff and they usually go along with what seems best. But it seemed like a no win when nobody would listen to her, also out of character for the family. Now people are coming into for this, but it's not clear if it's for fathers day or his birthday. It's both, and just doesn't make sense to us. 

So ultimately this is what she sent in the family chat, which includes people not invited. I cosigned this as well.

""I love you guys very much and I’m very excited about this bbq coming up but I do not want to celebrate jaxons birthday on that day along with Father’s Day. I’m definitely excited to hang out and watch the boys play and celebrate the daddy’s but i would like to surpass the cake and Gifts ect for Jax. No reason in particular and no hard feelings I just want to celebrate it separately on his actual birthday. Michael and I are gonna just have a special jaxon day and celebrate then. Thanks for understanding ek 💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘""

Are we the asshole or are we just trying to define what's happening. A small part of me feels bad because my father probably sold it to the out of towners as his birthday, but we have zero part in it. Also we did go to discovery cove for his birthday last month. It's part of SeaWorld where you snorkel with fish and sharks, swim with dolphins etc. But it's fairly cheap for them because of connections.

c0t6mw	2019-06-15 04:00:12	saphirekey	AITA For Continuing to tell my mom to go to therapy?	"Hi, so I posted before around Mother's Day. I'm a mobile user so I don't know how to copy the link. But the break down of it all is that my mother has some bad coping issues, especially with my grandmother's death 7-8 years ago and recently about 6 months ago the family dog passed. When she can't cope much longer she has a habit of unleashing what she has bottled up for that moment and it is usually in the form of anger.

I took some of the advice that other people told me and calmly sat down with her and spoke about seeing a therapist. She immediately got defensive and shut down the conversation. Multiple people have told her she would be better if she did, but she continues to ignore it.

It's hard, guys. I feel like the enemy each time I bring it up. Mental illnesses run on my mom's side of the family, depression being one of the bigger ones. She always has an excuse. ""I'm just sad because [sister] doesn't visit or talk to me anymore."", ""I'm mourning your grandmother."", ""I miss my dog."" 

There's a cheap clinic nearby that offers group therapy. Grief specifically. I've offered to take her and she's still offended by it. 

I've been accused of not being a loving daughter by repeatedly saying that a therapist would help. She's said things like, ""I tried my best raising you and this is how you repay me? By demanding that I throw money at someone to have them tell me I'm crazy!?""

I've also told her to stop taking those sketchy weight loss pills. They are untested and can potentially be a threat to one's mindset. I think she's considering that one at least. One type of pill that isn't on the market anymore made her angry and paranoid, a side effect of it that was never listed until many people started to experience it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
