bzmf43	2019-06-12 03:59:44		WIBTA if I break up with my girlfriend for trying cocaine	"while this might seem cut and dry, I am a bit of a psychonaut. I use psychedelics like shrooms or cactus on limited occasions in order to get in my headspace or think about the universe or things like that. I do not use any other ""hard"" drugs or drink or smoke. I use psychedelics for their mental expansion, and they're very safe drugs. any time I'm trying a new drug I am very sure to be as extensive as I can in researching it's effects, toxicology (if that information is available) and potential drawbacks.

my girlfriend Amy (not her real name) is thankfully not one to call me a druggie, she's been supportive and doesn't care about my usage, though she will not partake herself. recently she's brought up to me a few times that she'd like to try cocaine. I told her that's a neurotoxic drug with a very high potential for addiction and I would very much discourage her from trying it, though this is her decision ultimately. I saw this being a potential response, and unsurprisingly she questioned why her trying this drug was any different from me trying psychedelics. I explained to her in the best of my ability that I would not use a hard drug like cocaine and generally stay away from anything with a high potential for addiction or neurotoxicity. she still wants to try it, and while I'll stand firm that I think it's a bad idea, I won't stop her if this is what she wants to do.

so, WIBTA if I broke up with her over trying this drug? am I wrong to think my usage is in some way better than what she wants to partake in? obviously I would tell her I would leave before she makes her decision, but would I be an asshole for doing it?"		1	0

The main reason I got there is because it is cheap and she does a sufficient job as my hair style is very simple. The price is $8 and I usually leave a tip rounding up to $10. 

This one time after the cut I leave the usual $10 and she says it is $12. Apparently she raised her prices, as she said pointing to the sign. I give her $12 and she asks me about not giving her a tip. I made up a lie about not having any more change, but really was because it was more than what I intended to give her including tip, and I don't plan on going back.

Little backstory. Our father passed away and the insurance money was split 4 ways(spouse and 3 legal heirs). 

A.)My siblings decided to give 25% of their share to our mum,since we all thought that she was the only benificiary. It would be a nice gesture. I, however, would like to deposit all of it to an existing joint account of which I share with my mum therefore giving her access to all of my share if ever she needed it which we all know she might not. We all have jobs, I'm the only one with a family of my own and about to make a drastic change of career.

B.) I told my wife about it and she asked why not split the money on our(my wife and i's) joint account and my mum and i's account. I feel like it's not hers(wife) or mine to spend. We didn't earn it. I told her we would only take from it when we desperately need financial support, or in case of emergencies, and for our child's education.

I feel like my actions would send a different message. Like I'm being greedy or there's mistrust. I don't want to step on any toes specially regarding finances so WIBTA?tia"	No A-holes here	0	0

bzmcoo	2019-06-12 03:52:05	notevenabridesmaid00	AITA for holding a grudge over being passed over for the bridal party of a longtime friend?	"Throwaway account just in case, though god only knows if this situation is common enough for that to matter or not. Buckle up, this is gonna get long.

So, my best friend. Let’s call her Mary. We’ve been friends for over a decade and we get along great. Like any friends, we have disagreements but we can tell each other anything. We’ve always been there for each other through painful breakups, bad grades on tests, big accomplishments, everything.

Mary recently got married and obviously I was thrilled for her. Now since high school at least, we’d always talk about getting married, being in each other’s bridal parties, etc. Obviously this is not a legally binding contract but things like that mean a lot to people, at least they did to me.

So several months before the wedding we’re hanging out and she breaks the news to me that they’ve decided to keep the bridal party family-only. Was I upset? Yeah, obviously, but hey, I can understand keeping things small. Then I find out that this family-only parry includes her fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. Not wife or even fiancée, girlfriend. I was blindsided and hurt, because to me, that’s NOT family. Mary and I might not share blood but in every other way we are sisters. I couldn’t believe she would do this to me. I know that being a bridesmaid might not be a big deal to everyone, but to me this felt like a complete betrayal of our friendship.

I told Mary I needed space and  she said she understood. We didn’t talk for a few months, the longest ever, but eventually I decided I didn’t want to lose our friendship over this. She knows more about me than probably anyone else in the world and I love her. So we made up and I went to the wedding. Honestly it was pretty painful for me to be there because I felt like an outsider rather than a best friend. But I made it through the night without bashing her husband’s brother’s girlfriend’s head in so hey, I’ll call that a win.

All was well, or not. I’ve noticed lately I’ve been rather petty in my stupid revenge. I’ll cancel plans last minute for no real reason, let the phone ring through to voicemail, leave texts on read, etc. We live quite far apart (as in several hours) so this can be a pretty big inconvenience as it’s no day trip. And yeah, like I said, I know this is all totally stupid, totally juvenile revenge. But it turns out I’m still hurt and angry and I don’t know what else to do. I tried talking to her about this before but I’ve always known she was someone who has “misters before sisters” priorities. I suspect it was his choice to do this for the bridal party for reasons I won’t get into, which is why I know if I talk to her about it she’ll just get defensive.

I know I’m being petty but am I being an asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

So it was nearing the the end of our school year and my friends thought skipping the final (and easy) lesson of the day would be cool. I thought nothing of it cause the are not the best at making decisions (as most teenagers).

They had basically not skipped, but came to class late and left 30 mins early.

Me, being a kid who liked to know stuff, wanted know what would happen to them. The teacher said that they would be written up for being late and missing the second part of class. She didn't know their names so she asked me and I only told her who were present.

I noticed her doing that to her girlfriends early on and it didn't bother me much, but lately I've noticed that she calls everyone that. Guy friends, co-workers and such. We were eating with her friends and she says ""babe"" and I answered, but she wasn't even talking to me. She's not being flirty about it(she's always done this, even before we met apparently) I thought it was a term of endearment. Something she calls me. I've been thinking about it lately, and I just feel uncomfortable with it. I obviously can't control what language she uses. So I asked her not to call me that anymore. she can call me by my name, or find something else to call me. I feel like I'm in the right, (if a guy were to call every girl he talked to ""baby"" i think that would cross a line) I just talked to her about it finally. She didn't say much and went to sleep. That made me want to post here. Tl;dr: SO calls everyone babe. I asked her not to refer to me as that anymore.

bzmc1h	2019-06-12 03:50:01	stan_x3	AITA for getting mad at my friends for taking me to the casino?	"So about 3 weeks ago, some friends (two male, one female) decided to plan a trip to our local casino. Now this casino was just off the highway and we lived in the city, just off our college campus, so we had to take an Uber to get there.

Anyway, we were all a little drunk from having drinks and they asked me if I wanted to go to the casino with them. I said yeah, because I've never been to the casino before, though I didn't think I was allowed in since I was only 20 (I think the legal age is 21 in my state). They're all over 21, so they could all get in if they wanted to. They showed me various sources (including a pdf apparently from the casino we were going to) saying that I only had to be 18 to get in, but at that point I changed my mind about going. I felt like they were coming up with excuses to get me to still go along with them.

Nevertheless, I reluctantly agreed to still go along with them. When we got there, I showed the doorman my ID, he was a little confused, but he let me in. I'm still not sure I was supposed to be let in.

At the casino there was nothing but rows of slot machines. Which was fine, because I was expecting to play slots. I took out $20 from the ATM, though I only wanted to spend $10 of that. After a while, I spent some money, and I watched these friends spent some as well. I think one of the guys won like $80 (I don't remember the exact amount), though he spent it all. They wanted me to go again, so I reluctantly did. However, I told them I wanted to try out some tables, like blackjack and roulette, which they told me the casino had. But nope, the casino didn't have them, just more slot machines.

I settled down at one last slot machine, and I noticed the lever wouldn't budge. They told me that if I spent more money, the lever would work. I continued to press the button to get more plays, and sooner or later all my money was gone. I spent all of it, and the lever was still stuck where it was.

Either way when we spent all the money we were going to and we left the casino, I got mad at them as we were waiting for the Uber to pick us up and take us back to their place, because, as I told them before, I didn't want to spend all my money faster than I intended, and that they lied to me about various aspects of the casino. I also saw one of them cry (the same person who spent all the money he won), though I wasn't sure if it was real or fake crying. They all seemed to get over it when we got in the Uber to take us home, and we had wings after, though I think they still remember.

I just wanted to know if I'm the asshole in this situation for yelling at them. I don't know whether I should feel bad for it, because I wish I hadn't yelled at them, but then again I felt like they were acting really shitty.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Friends took me to a casino I changed my mind about going to, got mad at them because I was pressured into spending more money than I wanted to.

bzmc0o	2019-06-12 03:49:57	chikpeaa	AITA for removing my former best friend of 18 years out of my life?	"I'll try to keep this short and sweet, but there's some backstory involved.

&#x200B;

My best friend 'Stacy' and I are cousins who were born a month apart.  Our moms were very close; they immigrated to America together, where they remained roommates until they both got married and had kids (us).  Stacy and I grew up in the same neighborhood, and even when I moved due to my parents' divorce, we continued to talk almost everyday.  I've done *and* been through a lot in my life, some of which still keep me up at night, but she was there through all of it.  I'm not gonna bore you with details, but I've been out and on my own since I was 17 years old.

&#x200B;

My little sisters 'Erica' (7) and 'Veronica' (10) were living with my recently remarried mom in a city around 30 minutes away from me.  I've practically raised my little sisters, and have always been protective of them, so when I found out that my mom's new husband (a man that none of us except her have ever met, who she met while visiting her mom in her home country, and who also already had **7 of his own kids**) was coming to live with us, I couldn't have been more wary.

&#x200B;

Long story short, the year that followed was not kind to anyone in our family, Veronica worst of all.  My sisters came over to my and my boyfriend 'Jared's' place fairly often, and it was during one of these visits that she told me just what she'd been going through since my mom's husband had moved in.  At that point it had been over a year since he'd been with them.

&#x200B;

I tried to comfort her, told her that I'd do something about it.  After taking an hour to calm down, Jared and I dropped them off at his parents house, and as we set off to my mom's house, I called my aunt.

&#x200B;

After giving her all of the explanation I felt I was able to, she tells me, ""I...I'm at my birthday dinner right now.  It cost 200 dollars.  I can't just leave.""  No amount of me pleading swayed her, and when I called my best friend (who was at the dinner with her alongside her father and sister), she told me, ""I can't just come whenever you call.""

&#x200B;

I hadn't asked them to come with me and Jared to confront my mom's husband, I asked only for support whenever they were able.  They stayed firm, and off Jared and I went to get to the bottom of everything.

&#x200B;

We took pictures of my mom's husband's identification and green card, and we had recorded the entire conversation.  A police call and a drive back home later, and I sat to watch movies with my sister, rubbing her back as she cried into my shoulder.  It's been 2 years, and my mom *and* my sisters still talk to my aunt and my cousin.  But I can't bring myself to do the same.

&#x200B;

Am I being too inconsiderate of my aunt and cousin's life by expecting them to be there for us?  AITA?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: my sister went through an extremely traumatic experience, and my best friend didn't come when I called her to support even if I'd asked her to come after her prior plans.  AITA?

Edit: I want to stress that though I had asked multiple times for her to come, I did not ask her to cancel.  I let her know that she could come in a few hours or a few days.  Whatever she was able."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So tonight I came home from working late (I am a teacher at the end of the year),~ 10:15pm. My husband is already in bed and upset that I have come home so late (he knew I was going to be gone; I was home for dinner/clean up beforehand). When I get home, I grab a snack. At this point, it’s 10:30. He refuses to let me sleep in bed stating that I’ve kept him up.

Today her dog jumped up onto the bed we were on and I exhaled all the smoke into his face while he was laying down.  I know that this is not a friendly thing to do with a pet but I just did it stupidly.  She yelled at me and started getting very angry because supposedly that is especially dangerous to pets but I don't know if this is true and even if it is I really didn't mean to and I apologized. 

&#x200B;

She got mostly over it in like a couple minutes and we continued to watch Breaking Bad and the dog started freaking out a little bit. It wasn't too crazy but he just looked funny and was acting weird. I think it might've had the munchies but it's also a dog so it was probably just hungry.

&#x200B;

This really started to upset her after she took notice of the weed's effect on the dog. She started hyperanalyzing everything it was doing and made a big deal about it. She wasn't crying but she was pissed off more than she should be. I  eventually left and texted her later but she hasn't responded yet."	Asshole	0	0
bzmaru	2019-06-12 03:46:10	throwawayqueen01	WIBTA if I reclaimed virtual items from my BF's account after I break up with him?	"So. Some context. I am a 26f dating a 21m and we've been seeing each other for a year and a month now. At the very beginning of our relationship, we were great. But unforeseen circumstances resulted in me moving in with my new boyfriend and his family about two months into our relationship. Things kind of fell apart from there. 

We fought every week. Mostly over the fact that I was/am a VERY solitary person. I enjoy my alone time and I spend it playing an (insert popular MMORPG) whenever I am not working or doing college classwork. Essentially, he'd yell at me over not getting enough attention/having to compete for my attention/me enjoying my hobby 'too much'.

So I cut back on it. A lot. I played it maybe twice to three times a week, for very short periods and it KILLED ME. We continued to fight monthly. I couldnt fall back into my old solitary habits.

Well, a few months ago, he stopped being an asshole about it and decided to try and join the MMORPG with me. I was dubious but grateful, so I bought him some virtual items to help him in the game/give him some aesthetic variance.

Unfortunately, after a year of fighting and me just being really unhappy, I'm planning on breaking up with him and moving out. And I also intend on reclaiming all the virtual items (totalling about $60) from his account since, he only downloaded it for my sake and has never actually played it since downloading it.

But some background info: I (M21) met my girlfriend (F19) back in December at a college party and we kicked it off extremely well, and eventually (a few months later) started dating. However, she had this ex that broke up with her in something like early november - so it was definitely still raw when I first met her. Actually it messed her up a lot, they dated throughout high school and into college for a few months. And with approximitaly a 1 month turnaround, I was a bit uncomfortable since it took me a long ass time to move on from my previous ex.

Since they dated so long, they share a lot of the same close friends. I habe met them all and I really liked them. So she hangs out with those friends a good bit, but usually avoided hanging out with them when her ex was around. But tonight she texted me saying she was going to drink with some of those friends and her ex (she just listed their names, 5 people to be exact) and it bothers me a bit. 

I don't want to discourage her from hanging out with her close friends from high school nor do I want to be that boyfriend. And I do trust her decision making, but it still bothers me for some reason.

TLDR: My girlfriend and her ex drank together because they have a bunch of mutual friends (6 including her and him were together tonight)."		1	0

bzm5u6	2019-06-12 03:30:59		WIBTA if I got a lower paying job?	"Hello, Reddit. I’m newly married one month. I’m not used to my decisions affecting other people, and I don’t know what to do in this situation because my husband and I disagree. 

I work a very high stress job that pays well. I make $85k/year with the opportunity for generous bonuses. 

I’ve never enjoyed the stress of my job but I liked my coworkers, and I was able to manage the stress for the most part. I did have to go into counseling and start medication to help me with the highs and lows of my job.  But it was getting managed. 

For a long time, my husband and I had been talking about moving to the city where he grew up. This town is 5 hours away from where we lived and where my job is physically located. On a whim, we both applied for jobs in the new town. We both got interviews. He got his job. I didn’t get mine. I was devastated. My interview had gone amazingly well and I could tell they had planned on giving me an offer. But they told me several weeks later that a more experienced candidate swept in at the last minute and took the job. It happens.

I told my office that my then-fiancé was moving 5 hours away and I would like to join him. Surprisingly, they made a bid to keep me. They offered to open an office in the new city. 

At first that seemed incredibly exciting. And it is. Except we were supposed to open the office six months ago. I’m working out of my home and traveling frequently (about 20 hrs per week on the road) and struggling to keep up with my workload because the travel is taking up my time. It is also harder working from home than I thought. I am struggling with depression. The isolation is not working for me. My husband does not understand my job, and I’m learning that trying to manage the stress in isolation from my coworkers is not possible. I had not realized how much I relied on being able to vent and share problems with them (and vice verse) to manage my stress. 

The reason my new office hasn’t materialized is that our numbers are down company wide the past two quarters and they don’t want to spend money on it until the numbers are up again. We don’t know when that will be. 

A few months ago, the local state job that I had interviewed called me to let me know someone had died suddenly and they wanted to hire me. At the time, I rejected the offer because I believed I would be opening an office for my current company. However, I occasionally see similar job postings for state jobs and I consider hitting up my old interviewer to see if I can get the job. 

My husband does not want me to do this because of the pay cut (probably by about $30k). He thinks I am being impatient and need to give my current job more time. But I’m miserable. Would I be an asshole if I went against my husband’s wishes and sought out a local but lower paying job?"		1	0

The airport is 1 hour away and with traffic close to 1.5 hours away. I offered to either pick her up or drop her off but not both. I even offered to pay for an Uber to take her/pick her up but she ended up getting a ride from one of her friends. Am I the asshole for not wanting to make an extremely inconvenient drive?

bzm3p6	2019-06-12 03:24:36	falucious	AITA for telling my wife she's selfish for refusing to make our son a non-vegan birthday cake	"Update denied by mods.

My wife has been vegetarian-ish as long as I've known her (ten years), but last fall she made the leap to full vegan. I was (and am) very supportive of her not eating meat before the change and have been very supportive of her since then.

We have three kids aged 7 to 1. My wife and I agreed that, while veganism is the right way for ethically conscious adults, it currently does not meet the nutritional needs of growing children in the same way an omnivorous diet does. We've seen the horror stories of children and pets starving and dying at the hands of vegan parents and are staying far from that. Our agreement means our kids eat a regular omni diet and my wife doesn't have to prepare any meat. Simple.

My middle kid will be five next week and my wife is spearheading the whole event. Today she started trying out cake recipes. I'm usually the taster and provide feedback as honestly as I can. Tonight there was a cake cooling and she told me she'd let me try it as soon as it cooled and she'd made frosting.

I tried the cake. It was off. I was confused for a moment, then it hit me.

Me - ""Did you adapt this recipe to make it vegan?"" 

Her - ""Yeah I figured I needed to start now if I wanted to have something workable by the party.""

I put the cake down. ""Why are you making a vegan cake? None of the children are vegan.""

She became defensive. ""I wanted to make sure there were options, I don't know what everybody's diet is like.""

Me - ""Are you making a non-vegan cake?"" 

Her - ""No I just wanted to make something everybody could eat."" 

Me - ""You're the only vegan who will be at the party."" 

Her - ""You don't know that, other parents could be too."" 

Me - ""But none of the kids are."" 

Her - ""So what? I'm going to be at the party too."" 

Me - ""Right, but it's not your party and you're not a guest. You forcing everybody to eat vegan when it's not your birthday is extremely selfish.""

This turned into a fight. I'm an asshole, she's disconnected and selfish. She refuses to see how her refusing to make anything not vegan for our child's birthday isn't insane. Finally she told me that I should make the fucking cake and stormed out of the room and refuses to talk to me. She's set up shop in the guest room and I'm sleeping alone tonight.

I'll admit to saying petty shit as she walked away. ""Can you even hear yourself? ""Hey kids, the only cake is vegan, there are no alternatives. I'm not forcing veganism on you, but if you don't choose the vegan option then you get nothing. Happy birthday son.""""

I will make the cake, I don't have a problem with that. I'm not half as talented but I've done it before and I'll do my best. My son is starting kindergarten in the fall, I know he's nervous and I want him to feel confident and excited with all his friends around him.

AITA for telling my wife she's selfish for refusing to make our son a non-vegan birthday cake?

Edit: Seeing all of the responses to this post has made me take a hard look at my position. I still think it's dumb that she is refusing to consider a non-vegan cake, but all year our kids have gone to birthday parties and she's had to stand quietly aside, eating nothing, having no cake. I understand how ostracized she has felt and she just wants to be included. I'm going to apologize to her and help her make the best vegan cake as best I can. I'll make a non-vegan to go with it, it won't be good but it'll be there. I love my wife and this isn't the hill I want to die on.

Say what you want, but to me this is a NAH situation. Thanks for helping me come to my senses."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzm21h	2019-06-12 03:19:31	LovelyLilimoon	WIBTA if I quit a job I just got hired at for a better one?	"I know I'm probably a bad person but so for what counts hear some context of the situation. Before I worked at this job I worked in Barnes and nobles in their Cafe since February. Although I love the coffee, the food, and the people I hated working there. Because should you have any ounce of autonomy you get pushed back in line. I kid you not I got in trouble for shaking the blender to better mix ingredients for a second. All I was doing was literally just moving the base and the syrup that was normally always sitting in one corner. They Said that it messes with the way the frappuccino will end up. Which was completely ludicrous because the frappuccinos I made before looks the exact same as the ones made after I stopped mixing it. What drove me to look for another job was simply the fact that most weeks working there me and many other employees would get roughly around 10-15 hours when me and many others were basically told that we would get 20 to 30 every week. 

So I started filling out applications by the dozens everyday. at first I was picking jobs that would be an improvement to the one but I was currently at but as time went on with no call backs. I started to get a little bit more desperate and was just applying at anywhere that I had a skill set for. And this time I found a pretty good one that was offering full-time. To my surprise they called me their back the day after talking about when to training which would all be paid. And they're starting pay was about 13.50 hour with the benefits.  the only thing left to do was scheduled an interview which the lady said she would call me back for. After waiting about a week I called back to which she said that she wasn't ready yet and to give her another week or two. After a week or two of waiting I started filling out more job applications to which I eventually found the one that I am currently working at. A day after I filled out the application they called to schedule an interview which was the following day and after that they wanted to schedule onboarding within the week. During that week I got an email from the first job stating you know you're basic we didn't pick you spiel. So I went on with the onboarding and got hired. This job paid about $9 an hour part-time with no benefits but at the time I just needed a job. A week after I had started working there I had a week vacation previously planned and during that vacation the first job called for an interview although I was a bit confused I promptly scheduled one. After the interview they wanted to onboard me immediately. Which I accepted give them their oral drug test and they told me my official first day of training would be June 27th which gives me enough time to send in a two weeks notice to my current one. I just feel kind of bad about the entirety of it. My fiance says but that's kind of a terrible thing to do and I basically wasted their time.

bzm16v	2019-06-12 03:16:52		AITA for letting my boyfriend buy me a Dyson because of a fight?	"I (24F) have been wanting the Dyson Airwrap for about 3 months now, I’ve been talking about it on and off.  It’s about $600 here. 

Last night I found out that my boyfriend (25M) hung out with this girl who I’ve had a problem with for a while now and lied to me about it. Complicated thing is this was over 2 years ago and I only found about it recently. 

Basically she’s been proven to be slutty as she ruined numerous relationships prior. They were friends prior to us dating, but I always felt uncomfortable with her because she’d send him slutty snaps etc. 

He went on a trip to NYC to visit his mom because she lives there, and lo and behold, she happens to be there too. He tells me she messaged her that she wants to chill, go sight seeing and stuff, and I told him I’d feel really uncomfortable and he promised me he wouldn’t see her. 

Anyway this old photo comes up of him and a famous tennis star, but it’s cropped weirdly. I then find the whole picture and she’s on the other side. It’s basically the 3 of them with the tennis star in the middle. 

What’s annoying is that he sent me the photo, with him and the tennis star, but she posted the photo of her and the tennis star.  I never connected the dots because I’m not friends with her on Facebook.

So I figure it out and I’m really pissed off but eventually cool off. I tell him okay, whatever, as long as you guys didn’t do anything, and this was over 2 years ago. I tell him that he’s me out to an expensive dinner this weekend, but he suggests to get me the Dyson instead. 

AITA for letting him buy it for me? I feel bad because it’s a lot of money, and I was raised to be conservative with money."		1	0
bzm16p	2019-06-12 03:16:51	honeybear212	AITA for breaking a 12 month lease agreement with roommates 5 months in?	"I unfortunately was laid off from my work without any warning yesterday. The only severance package was paying me until my last day of work and my PTO. I am eligible for unemployment, but at most will get $1800, which would barely cover my rent + utilities. So, I discussed with my roommate the possibility of subletting and she does not want to live with a stranger. She said she would discuss with her husband possibly paying for my rent for 2 months and would help me find another job asap, but the idea of being here while they pay rent for the whole place makes me uncomfortable. Also it turns out it would cost me $200 to remove myself from the lease, and I would certainly not move out until I found a replacement. Am I the asshole for the leaving this lease agreement 5 months in?

Anyways he seemed so gung-ho to talk to me then took it back later 

Me: how’s everything going? I know you were having some personal issues. Is everything ok. 

Him: I think my gf and I’s relationship is coming to an end. I hope you're doing well. I want to talk soon but I'm also going through a difficult transition and don't feel super comfortable till that transition is complete. Probs two weeks at most. I hope you understand. Thanks. 

Me: I understand, no rush. Thanks for communicating with me. Hope everything turns out well. 

*a week later*

Me: Sorry to be wishy washy but I don’t think we should talk. I don’t want Anna to find out we talked and be upset and go to anyone and get me in legal trouble because I acted absolutely insane in the past towards her. 

Him: I understand and I agree. I don’t want to talk when it’s not appropriate. 

Me: Yeah. I don’t want to put my entire livelihood at risk. I just assumed it was going to be appropriate if you were willing to talk but wanted to err on the side of caution 

Him: Well I don’t want that either and whenever I reach out that’s when it would be appropriate

Me: Ok lol sorry it’s confusing cause you reached out a few weeks ago 

Him: I know and I’ve been going through a rough patch and need space and time. So I appreciate your understanding.

Me: I do. I wanna talk but I ruined everything by being a bitch last year. Hope everything is well-ish

Him: Tbh I’m dealing with some mental health issues, I’m kinda at a low and I don’t think I can deal with added stress right now. Please be mindful and helpful by not stressing me more than I can handle at one time. I’ll let you know when I’m in a better place. 

Me: That’s totally fine. I just was apologizing and expressing that I wasn’t upset because I still would enjoy talking to you eventually when you’re ready. I know you don’t wanna talk to me about these issues but if you do you can reach out

Him: I very much appreciate you understanding, thank you

bzm059	2019-06-12 03:13:53	notkiks	AITA for bringing food into the house when my mom is on a diet?	"I’m 20 and am living at home for the summer. For as long as I can remember, my mom has been trying one crazy diet after another. She is not, nor has she ever been, fat by anyone’s definition- at 5’4 the heaviest she has ever been (besides pregnancy) is 140 lbs. I highly suspect an eating disorder but despite repeated attempts to discuss this with her I have been shut down at every turn.
To really get a feel for why this has turned into an issue, you first have to understand that I developed an eating disorder at 11 that I actually was sent to rehab for. I am still technically in recovery and continue to struggle with my own body image. That being said, I continue to work with my therapist on eating what I want when I want to without intense feelings of shame and guilt. 
My mom has created a diet that is an amalgamation of several diets she has previously been on combined together for maximum results. However, because my mom lacks the ability to control herself, an insane about of food has been banned from our home. I don’t mean unhealthy, processed, highly fatty foods. I mean things like cucumbers and tomatoes, cereal, bread, pretzels, bananas, and other healthy foods that she has somehow decided will make her fat. 
I also have various food allergies including nuts, soy, and legumes, so when I came home for the summer there was truly nothing for me. My relationship with food is quite fragile, so having access to food is important for the maintenance of my recovery. 
I can 100% respect and understand not wanting to eat junk, I wasn’t trying to bring cookies or ice cream or fast food into the house- just some easy snacks like pretzels, bananas, granola bars, etc. However, when I brought these foods into the house my mom and I literally got into a screaming match where she told me I was selfish and ungrateful, and if I didn’t like the rules I could leave. Admittedly, I did not react well. I was incredibly frustrated and told her that as her daughter, making sure I was fed should be her priority. Even as I’m writing this I do realize that at 20, this really doesn’t hold true anymore, but I still do feel that if she really cared about my wellbeing, she would lift this ban. Things continued to escalate and ugly things were said on both sides. I feel like it is so unnecessary to have these enormous fights over such trivial matters, but I also do feel like I deserve to eat well. 
Am I being selfish? Should I be more supportive of her desire to keep herself fit, especially since she is accommodating my needs by allowing me to stay here for the summer?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

There’s this person who we both work with who I think is nothing but trouble. I always hear stories from my coworkers about all the mean things he’s done. Asking one of the minor workers there for nudes, trying to fight a customer because said customer was dating a girl he liked, and overall he was just a selfish person from what I remember being around him. He’d always show up to work late, he was always this self-riotous dick who thought he was the best, he’d always slack off and be a general nuisance. He was like the real-life equivalent of the stereotypical 90’s school bully character. He’s also a drug dealer and his house is under 24/7 police surveillance right now which doesn’t really help his case.

My sibling is inviting everyone over and had to invite him to be fair but I just don’t feel good about having him at our house at all. Especially since there’s going to be a few minors here too. I do feel a bit selfish though because she did have to invite everyone to be fair.

bzlys6	2019-06-12 03:10:01	eoppster	AITA for telling a new mother that her husband sent me crude pics?	"I’m conflicted. A totally random dude from a different state requested me on insta. It was his personal page and a private profile. His picture was with his pregnant wife and his caption was #father #husband. I accepted his request out of curiosity and requested a follow back. He accepted right away so I checked out his profile. Normal dude - tons of pics celebrating his new son and loving tributes to his wife. Then this happens:

I get another request from a brand new account that looks EXACTLY LIKE this guy. He DMs me telling me I’m beautiful and sends topless pics. I refer back to the other Instagram to make sure it’s the same dude (cuz wtf?) and confirm the tattoos are the same. Apparently he’s really dumb bc I ask him if his wife would like him sending me crude pics and he plays dumb. I then proceed to send him a pic of HER insta account with a pic of him in it. He then begs me not to say anything to her. I’ll spare you the details but by that point he had already sent me dick pics (and a video with his face in it). I wanted to see how far he would go, and he went there.

I proceeded to block him but I really feel weird now. His wife probably has no idea that she has a shitty ass husband. Her instagram is allll about him and says how perfect he is. But I feel like it’s not my place to shake things up for them. If he keeps being dumb, which he seems awfully good at, she will find out soon enough. Right? Otherwise, I have plentiful screenshots to send her which should give her enough info to determine her husband is out to cheat on her (or already is). AITA if I out him to her and possible help collapse a marriage with a newborn?

EDIT: ok y’all, I messaged the wife on insta and told her about it. BUT I don’t think it went through or she’s able to view it because we don’t follow each other. What now???

"Disclaimer: I don’t find mental issues/substance abuse funny in any way, I take it very seriously and abundantly respect all those going through any sort of rehabilitation or needing to attend rehabilitation.

My (33F) husband (28M) and I have been together for 7 years, he is flying home tomorrow after going on a short trip to check on our house that we’re renting out. We prank/troll each other a lot, we both like to have fun in our relationship and have the same sense of humor. I was going to make him a sign that says “welcome home from rehab” and hold it up at the airport tomorrow when I pick him up, I know he’d think it was hilarious and start thinking of ways to get me back, but is that insensitive and kind of an asshole move for people who have or are going through rehab or something similar?

Update:  In light of a few responses, which I appreciate because I recognize that I don’t always consider every angle, I will err on the side of caution and I think I’ll make a sign saying something like “3 days apart! We did it!” or “we’ve been waiting 3 days for this moment!”"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzlw7v	2019-06-12 03:02:19	leho1995	AITA for not cleaning water stains	"I share a flat with two other girls, one of them is a bit younger than me, the other one is around 30. I'm the only student, the other two is working. 

The older one had some criticisms that I truly wanted to correct, such as we had lots of hair in the bathroom. She also had some really weird requests though, such as please folder your towels nicely.  And some really detailed ones, such as a drawer in the kitchen wasn't closed. Plus, she's always rude and doesn't always say hi to me. I literally only talked to her when she complained. 

One time she screamed at me because she asked me to buy a chemical and I bought a slightly different one, but still useful. Ever since that I was afraid of her. 

Last week it was my turn to clean. I have exam period and I finished quickly. It wasn't perfect, but I have been more superficial before and noone said a word... Besides, I did the essentials. She complained so much before that the flat stayed quite clean, actually.
 
This happened on the rare occasion when she was at home when I was cleaning and saw me finishing early. Early in the morning, I get an e-mail that I didn't finish my cleaning. She wrote that I didn't clean the microwave, the shower, the toilet and the sink. I was angry and tired and I cleaned these things, so I didn't answer.

I come back at night and she's been waiting for me. ""You didn't clean."" We start an argument and for the first time, I don't surrender. She shows me that there are water stains on the shower tap and on the shower door and she says I should have scrubbed it. She shows that there is grease in the sink, although it's almost invisible. (Only legitimate criticism, I believe.) She opens the microwave, but it's clean inside... Then she closes it and says there are fingerprints on the outside. 

I am angry and tired, I don't say a word, but I decide that I will move out once my contract ends. Next thing I notice, she wrote an aggressive e-mail... She won't clean this week. Claims I only cleaned the floor. She tried to speak with me, but I lied that I cleaned. If I cannot hold a sponge, I should move somewhere else. This is not a dorm and I don't treat it as my home. She mentions that once there was a small spot of shit below the toilet seat and that was probably my fault (long story short, it was my fault, and I cleaned it ASAP).  She didn't only send this e-mail to ME, but to the landlord and the other flatmate.

bzlvvf	2019-06-12 03:01:20		AITA for getting upset with my mom for taking the trash bags?	"To start off, let me provide a little details about our living arrangements.

I live in our ""vacation house"" and my parents come on the weekends, so the house is all to me for 5 days out of the week and I go to work and come back here throughout the week. My parents don't have me pay for rent or utilities except the cell phone bill for all of us and the cable/internet here. Everything else is paid for by my dad including the mortgage. He has been talking to me about giving me the house soon. I also pay for improvements to the house and small repairs here and there including cleaning and groceries and supplies for the house.

My mom is two things which are important to this story: she's an extreme germaphobe and cheap when it comes to stuff she buys. She's the worst germaphobe I've ever met in that she covers her food while she eats and won't let anyone in the kitchen while she's cooking/baking. It's due to some trauma of hers as a child but she's getting a little better these days.

For as long as I can remember, she's always been cheap when it comes to stuff. Instead of buying brand name, she always chooses the knock-off. And not the Kirkland knock-off, like the inferior ones that are of lesser quality.

I'm sort of that way, but kind of not.

For example, when it comes to trash bags, I buy good ones from Costco which last and are durable. She prefers the ones from those dollar stores that shred if you do anything to them.

So I bought a big box from Costco which had 2 rolls of 70 bags each, in total 140 bags. With my estimate of how often our trash can fills up, just one trash can for this whole box, the box could last us for 2 years, assuming we only use one per week, which is typical.

One day, I'm looking around for the roll of trash bags and can't find it. It had rolled onto the floor. When I bent down to pick it up, I noticed that the other roll was gone. It was an unused roll of 70 bags.

I look all over and can't find it so I text my mom. She says that she took them with her so that she could put her clothes in the bag so she doesn't bring bugs into the house when she comes over the weekend.

I told her that I paid for those bags, I buy the slightly more expensive ones because they're great, and she's over exaggerating on the bugs. If she wants to do that stuff, she needs to buy her own trash bags from the dollar store or wherever, not take mine for her own use which is an absurd waste of bags, in my opinion.

Do you think I overreacted? Am I in the wrong or an asshole for feeling this way?

It's petty, I know, but it irritates me given the circumstances."		1	0

He sat in on some conversations between me and my girlfriend, mediated, etc.. however he decided that in the week or so that we had been apart that he developed feelings for her. He confessed his feelings and she shot him down, and he stated that he didn’t care if it meant the end of our friendship because he felt she was the one. He wanted to keep it between my gf and him, because he felt that I wouldn’t appreciate it. He was right. A few days after he did this me and my gf resolved some stuff and got back together and she told me about it. I cut him off and blocked him on everything. She still hangs out with him in group settings and such. Tonight however, she went over to his house with a group of people and didn’t tell me. She admitted she was there right away and left. I blew up and told her how fucked up it was that she went there even though there were a couple friends there too.

AITA because I blew up on my girlfriend and told her she isn’t allowed to go to his house or hang out with him alone because of his feelings toward her?

ETA: We have had discussions about how I feel about it and she is well aware of how I feel towards him. I don’t know if that changes anything but we have talked about it and she is aware of my feelings."	Asshole	0	0

bzlsed	2019-06-12 02:51:08	RNae	AITA for not wanting to work 2 jobs?	"This has become a weekly argument at home. I am at my wits end. 

Six months ago I left my job that I was miserable at for a new position that I absolutely love. It had gotten to the point with my old job that my misery at work was overflowing into my days off. I never felt like I could just “relax”. I would get physically ill before going into work each day. It was terrible. For context I am a nurse that switched hospitals. 

The issue is that this hospital is relatively new to the area so it isn’t as busy as the more established hospitals. Upper management was convinced we were going to get busy after the new year so they hired in a bunch of new employees that we just don’t need. So now instead of being called off (or put “on call”) once a month it is becoming a once a week issue. I went from working 72+ hours every 2 weeks to around 55-60 hours. 

It has turned into a pay cut that is approximately $400-$500 less a month for me. 

On the flip side my husband has recently been promoted at work with a pay increase and increase in work hours. Prior to this promotion he was working around 60 hours every two weeks to now  approximately 80 hours. His checks have increased and he is bringing home an additional $500-$600 a month. 

He is frustrated with me and wants me to start searching for a new job and/or get a 2nd job. He says it is not fair that I only am working 2 days a week (24 hours) while he works 5-6 (40 hours). 
However, he also complained when I worked full time which is 3 days and got mad when I wouldn’t pick up extra shifts. I swear he doesn’t understand how difficult 12+ hour shifts are. And on top of it I work night shift so I am lucky to get 5-6 hours of broken up sleep before going into work. 

I understand his frustration because I was annoyed on the weeks I was working 48+ hours and he was going home early every day and only working like 20 hours but I never complained to him or tried to make him feel bad. I never demanded he find a second job or new job altogether because he enjoys his current work. Prior to this job he worked for a large corporation and was miserable. He came home every day in bad mood. I would have thought he would be more understanding because he has also worked somewhere he hated. 

We are able to pay our bills. If anything we have a little less “fun” spending money but I am more than willing to cut back on spending and have tried created a budget. An added bonus is that the decrease in working hours allows me more time to spend with our son - before I was always missing out on events due to work. 

I feel like in his mind having money and being wealthy is more important than my mental health/happiness. I have expressed this to him and he just so frustrated that he isn’t hearing it. He says he feels like I am settling.

bzlr06	2019-06-12 02:47:06	Cantorthedino	AITA Got mad at my friends because they ignored my texts	"     That title sounds really bad, but I just don’t know how to put it. My friends ;H (17) and P(19) and I (20) had decided to hangout tonight. 
      I offered to go to a fast food joint and messaged both of them. H had just kept responding in rick and morty quotes (I had just assumed he was just doing this to meme and a few of them could have been loosely interpreted as answers.) I had also asked him several times to just tell me no if he didn’t want to go to the food joint. (I stress that I had asked him 3 plus times in 15 minutes and had told him I had left) P didn’t respond so I asked H if he had him, and still with the pickle rick quotes.
     I wait at the place for twenty or so minutes with being left on read by p and still only getting pickle rick quotes from h.
    So I got really mad and blew up at them saying that instead of just straight up telling me no they just ignored my texts and were purposely making me feel like and anxious piece of shit. P told me “ we had no obligation to go to ,food joint, with you and you got all pissy at us for no reason” then it went back and forth for s few minutes with me telling them “you don’t have an obligation to go out with me yes, but it was still shitty of you to do this to me”
     They see no fault in them ignoring my texts and sending stupid quotes from a tv show while they went out and got food elsewhere, I get that I seem possessive of my friends in this situation, I care deeply for my friends and it seems like this situation happens often where I feel like shit.  
TLDR I got mad at two of my friends who knew I was heading out while one ignored me and the other sent pickle rick quotes for them to stand me up in a restaurant."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bzlqii	2019-06-12 02:45:37		AITA for being upset my partner is like this?	"I’m kind of hurt by this guy I’ve seen on and off for almost s year (I initiated breakups) because he invited me over at 9 am when I get off work to fuck and right after he says he’s going to sleep and said bye right after. I usually would stay over but his AC was broke 

He didn’t wanna cuddle. He didn’t really talk. He was tired, but I was like hey I am going to leave to go out of town this weekend and I guess I’ll see you next week (it’s Tuesday) and he said maybe I’ll see you but we will definitely talk. I wanted to leave after because his AC is broke and it was 90 degrees in his house. 

I’m used to my ex always wanting to talk and text and call and this guy doesn’t do that, yet he has mentioned what I would like at our wedding one day and he said he would forever be there for me. 

He seems distant and reserved like he can’t actually let me in and he seems distracted when we are together. Yet he hangs with my friends and I’ve met his family but I have yet to show him mine (my parents embarrass me with their values). He asks me to express my feelings to him. He makes any changes I ask him to. He brings me food to work. He makes me food. He massages me without asking. Invites me to weddings. I’ve met his family. Texts me every day. Cries when he has almost lost me. Hangs out with my friends and drives them around. We hang out for hours and hours on the weekend and play games or watch tv. 

I am kind of hurt he was like oh whatever, see you later. I know he is tired but I feel just used. Like I’m the FWB I think I am not but actually am. We have dated on and off. I left him cause he was too into video games and wouldn’t be considerate of me and let me play. Additionally, he doesn’t have a great job and he used to drink too much. 

He has never said I love you to me. He said he takes things slow so he doesn’t get hurt and he doesn’t wanna burn through potential mates too quickly without actually getting to know them. I left him before so I’m sure he won’t try and say I love you first. Well I don’t wanna waste my time. I am using to dating someone who was crazy about me from the start, but that also went down in flames so probably isn’t the best strategy. Yet, I hear many loving couples start off that way"		1	0

bzlpin	2019-06-12 02:42:41		AITA for not putting my dog down?	"I’m procrastinating on studying, so that led me to posting this. 

My dog is aggressive around the house. He’s a German Shepherd. 2 years old.

I got him from a shelter, and I trained him with a qualified trainer, but it was of no use. As he grew older, he grew more and more aggressive and territorial. I’d never seen anything like that. I quickly turned into a dog trainer, and my life now happily revolves around my dog.

He isn’t aggressive outside of the house, so we go to parks and dog friendly places together. His house (the whole neighborhood) really is where he’s aggressive. While I’m working with his issues with a trainer, I use management to prevent anything awful from happening. If he’s around the house, he’s muzzled and I take him out at odd times to avoid people. He is always a hundred percent under my control at all times. 

If someone he knows enters the house, no problem. But if it’s someone he doesn’t know, they have to meet at the dog park or he has to be in his kennel in a separate room with a muzzle on. You’d think I was being dramatic, but I’ve seen his reaction when someone he doesn’t know walks in the house. It was my trainer, and we were testing to see how he’d react, and it was terrifying. I had no question in my mind that if my dog wasn’t wearing a muzzle and leashed, he would have mauled her. 

I have two dogs. One is sweet. He does agility. Some of those people like to tell me that I’m being selfish by keeping him alive. That isn’t wrong for me, and I’m keeping a dangerous animal that could hurt someone if he got out. 

But he will never get out. He’s never been ANYWHERE where I haven’t had eyes on him. In his two years of existence, he’s never bitten a single person, and he’s never been given that opportunity. I keep absolute control of him at all times, and I’ll never let him hurt anyone. 

But I understand people that think I should put him down, and that I’m being selfish. It doesn’t matter if every single person replies to this post and tells me to put him down, I won’t. I’m going to ensure that no one around me is ever hurt by my dog. I promise they won’t be. I take full responsibility if it happens. 

If I just opened the door and let him outside without a leash, he would hurt someone, so I get the concern, but that opportunity will never happen. I am so careful. I don’t want anyone to be hurt by my best friend. I love him so much. I would never risk his life or any of yours. 

I’m hoping he’ll change, and I’m hoping one day he’ll walk down the street and be pet and it will all be fine. I’ve seen dogs make amazing recoverers, but until then, he is dangerous and I fully acknowledge that, but I will not put him down."	Not the A-hole	1	0

bzlokn	2019-06-12 02:40:00	Amazingjaype	AITA for taking my friend's stuff during his crisis?	"My friend suffers from a bipolar disorder.  Since high school, I supported them through thick and thin. It had affected my personal relationships, our own friendships and even my own depression. We use to live together (with another roommate) and since they stopped getting help, it pretty much soured our living situation. They pretty must cost us the apartment.  They had stopped seeking treatment almost as soon as we all moved in, I stopped being as supportive for my own sake. For a little extra details, I'm 28 and they are 29. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes, people with BD.1 go through these cycles. Where they have these phases where they do something drastic. I'm no professional in the subject, it's called a manic phase/cycle. My friend was in that phase. They  had a long high where they were really into church, and working but then the low came. They quit their job and church, and decided to buy a ticket to another state to move out of their mom's. They told me to come pick some stuff up, as they were cleaning house and was either  **giving stuff away** or **throwing it away. They had already given away a lot of things. (Clothes, Guitars, Books, and Figurines)**

&#x200B;

Initially, I went in with the idea to question their drastic life decision and try and **convince them NOT to go**. I pointed out the flaws in their plan. (They had no plan). I try to suggest they go back to therapy.  It's extremely hard to convince someone with BD.1 during their manic moments. They purchased the ticket already. Their mom accepted it, their sister accepted it. We were all reluctant but unless we physically stopped them ( which would be met with violence), There was nothing we could do. 

&#x200B;

They told me to take some stuff. So hesitantly, I took some paintings that a mutual friend painted. Really great stuff, that I would have been distraught to see thrown away. I didn't feel bad about it. However, I noticed  their  PS4 pro. I asked them what they were going to do with that? They said they were going to donate it.  I had a regular PS4, and I wanted the upgrade. At first, I felt bad. I was reluctant to take something that valuable. The paintings were sentimental. The pro was   
 lots of money, if they were seriously going to move why not sell it for the money? They said, they didn't need that much money and wanted to donate it.  So after some back and forth about what they wanted for it, they told me if I traded them my old one, they could donate that one and I could take the pro.  After a few days of thinking about it. I went back, and again questioned them leaving. They didn't change their mind, so I traded my old ps4 for their pro. 

&#x200B;

Now, I feel bad about it. I feel like I took advantage of their mania. AITA?

bzlo6k	2019-06-12 02:38:50		AITA for being upset with my girlfriend's inappropriate joke?	"Reddit, I've attempted to be as neutral as possible in my title, if I was speaking my mind fully ""inappropriate joke"" would read something else but she called it a joke and I'm attempting to see both sides. This is my first time posting here, apologies if this belonged more in r/relationships.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend was over hanging out Sunday night. I live in a predominantly black neighborhood, we're both white, and my neighbors were having a small cookout. We were having a lovely night, when she tells me she's going to say something ""off-color"" and proceeds to say ""there's nothing like a Sunday night N\*\*\*\*\* Party"" about their cookout. Uncensored, full N-word right out there on the porch.  I  was visibly upset. She seemed to understand she had crossed a line but tried to justify it that she's from the South. I told her I was mortified that she'd say something like that but attempted to put it aside until I could think about things. I probably should have had a conversation right there about it, but it was an otherwise lovely evening and I am not good with that sort of direct conflict without having time to think.

&#x200B;

The incident was definitely bothering me today and I could tell my distance was noticeable so I let her know as clearly as I could why I was upset, that I don't like that sort of talk or belief, that I don't think our living in the South makes that ok, and that I wanted to sit down and talk it over in person. She responded that it wasn't a tasteful joke but accused me of judging her too harshly for it; said I was unfairly accusing her of being a racist rather than accepting her sense of humor, but said she was genuinely regretting having said it.  She then told me I'm not the one who deserves the apology for the comment so she wasn't going to apologize to me.

&#x200B;

Further messages from her have been about how she's a caring person who loves everyone equally, that she's gotten validation from people who know her better than I do that she's not a racist, that I'm in the wrong for ""calling her a racist""(which I didn't directly do), that she doesn't know why I'm taking it so personally, and that it's up to me to do some soul-searching and figure out why this really has me so upset, because she doesn't know what more I want.

&#x200B;

What I want is my girlfriend to understand why saying ""it's a joke"" doesn't make saying racial slurs okay. From my point of view this all seems very clear as to why I would be upset, not just the comment itself but the response I got. I'm feeling gaslit by someone I deeply care about, but we all have blind spots, and I want to make sure I'm NTA here.

Today they brought up signing up long term to me and the other freebie class folks. We kind of got together and looked for some info re. pricing and, let's just say I don't think many/ any of us can actually afford it.

"She obviously has some hearing lost because she listens to the TV at an ungodly volume. I have asked her to turn it down and then gotten mad when it's been like 2 and 3 in the morning and she's listening to it super loud. She tells me that I'm just picky and that I like to find things to pick on her about and that I need to quit being so nit-picky. And I told her well you may think that the volume sounds normal but to the average person it's super loud.

I gently tried to talk to her about getting a hearing aid and she adamantly denied that she had a hearing problem and said that she will not even consider going to get checked for a hearing aid. Well I feel like I should not have to live like this in my own home. I pay my bills on time and I stay to myself. I can't even sleep at night because she keeps it so loud.

And don't even get me started on how she eats my food all the time. When I was living alone a carton of ice cream would last me two to three weeks and now I'm lucky if it lasts me two days. I'm just tired of not being able to have any peace and quiet and I'm having my food constantly eating all the time.

I recently paired up with a really great photog right out of school, and we did a really great, gory shoot. We applied a panel on my chest, between my breasts, and filled it with stage blood, and I proceeded to rip open my chest like a bad ass.

And, well, I'm nude. I mean, I literally had blood gushing down my front. Definitely a panty-ruiner.

So I started to update my business page on Facebook again. Then, because I'm so proud of the work I did with this particular photog, I shared it to my personal Facebook with a little blurb about my struggles with my health and how proud I was to feel healthy enough to get back out there again. 

I mentioned this today to a group of friends, and one of them told me that I'm being an ass because I'm friends with members of my boyfriend's family and, to quote, ""who wants to see an in-law naked?""

He spent about 10 mins looking for his keys because he wanted a bunch of McDonald’s hot and spicys. I said go for it man.

My parents are still together, however my dad cheated on my mom for years and left us for a year. He's very manipulative and verbally abusive towards my mom (sometimes things with her or my brother have gotten physical), but I still love both of them very much. 

They have yelling matches about everyday when my dad accuses my mom of cheating, doing drugs, etc. My dad also says that my mom never does anything to help. With my brother (17) now in rehab, they fight about that too. 

Everytime my parents are fighting and my dad walks away, my mom will repeatedly asked me if I think he's an asshole and what she did wrong. I'll tell her I don't know because I don't feel comfortable talking about it. She's gets very upset with me for this. She'll also try to talk about it when we're alone, which I rarely do because I don't know what to say. Whenever I do say something she doesn't like, she gets mad and starts yelling at me. 

My mom also has asked me repeatedly that if she moved into her parent's house, would I go with her. I'm not sure if I want to because I don't want to leave my dogs alone all day (my dad works a lot) to be sad and not taken care of, and it'd be harder because I'd be kinda far from my school and everything I know. I always tell her I'm not sure and that im worried, and she gets mad at me and acts like I'm abandoning her and don't want to be around her. 

This has gone on for so long, and im starting to think I may be the asshole for not talking to her and agreeing to move with her. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzlchz	2019-06-12 02:05:46	CuteNewt	AITA for refusing to help my mom anymore?	"So my mom is working on a project, and she asked for my help when she started. I was very happy to help at first.

She gave me a general idea of what she wanted and I helped her plan an outline, and then I helped her with the details, then the fine details, and before I knew it I had done over 80% of the work for her. I realized she'd basically gotten me to do everything for her, and I slowed down on the help I was providing. I requested she pick up where I left off on one of the parts. She initially said no problem and she'd get to it as soon as she had time. The project wasn't going to be in use for a few more weeks, so I went back to polishing some of the finer details on a piece I had started when she first asked for my help, and mostly completed but wasn't perfectly happy with.

It's been over a month and a half since she agreed to pick up the slack and she's done absolutely nothing she said she would. A couple weeks ago she requested we change the things I've already completed, and when I pointed out that was unnecessary, and if she'd only complete the thing she said she would, the whole project would essentially be done. She ignored me, and instead said that she'd just redo my work instead. I got upset and walked away for a while. I came back today to see what progress she had made, and she had neither altered my previous work, nor completed the thing I requested she do. She again requested I redo my work, or show her how to do it herself. I'm frustrated at this point so I just try to show her what I'd already done (which would also explain how to do it) and she wouldn't listen to my instruction because ""well there must be a different way, that's too convoluted"". Then she asked me to do the part I'd stepped back to let her do. I carefully explained that basically throwing all my hard work away and refusing to do her part had really hurt my feelings, because it was her project and I felt like I had done all the work for her. She told me ""well this way will make ME feel better"" which I take to mean my feelings don't matter.

I don't want to help her anymore, and I don't want to even help her learn how to redo my work. Other people are waiting on her to finish this project, and nothing can progress until the part I asked her to do is done. Her ""due date"" to finish this project was about four weeks ago. I know she's got other things going on in her life besides working on this project, but I also know she isn't so busy that she doesn't have any time to do it. I feel like her request to redo my work is just the latest way for her to procrastinate doing the part I requested she do, but before that I was willing to just patiently wait her out. Now I want to walk away entirely. Am I an asshole for not helping anymore? Am I an asshole for being a bit upset that I've done most of her work for her? I know I volunteered myself, but it feels like she's been ungrateful for my work and my help.

Okay so, a little bit of context here. I go to a all girls school and my BF goes to an all boys school. He is a really reserved person and hes kind of always complaining that I'm too open about my sexual life, kinks, etc. Well today my best friend just texted me and told me that my BF has been telling everyone on his class about our sex? And like, the positions and stuff, she also mentioned he talked about when with did it with and without a condom. Which, we have never had sex without a condom. She, my best friend, told me a guy in my BF's class told her that, yet she didnt tell me who. I asked her but she said he told her to keep it a secret and she didnt want to get in any drama. Okay, I get that but, I cant just accuse my boyfriend about something I have no proof of, also, its something he most likely wouldnt do. I insisted she told me but she still wouldnt and  then procided to tell me she just wanted to ""let me know my boyfriend is a dick"" and  that i should stop insisting. I told her to fuck off and she got upset because I was ""excusing him for being a douchebag"". I tried explaining to her that i needed to know who told her that to have a SOURCE so i cant tell my BF: ""So, X told me you been talking shit"" but as she wouldnt tell me I cant just go and start and argument of nothing. She then got upset and kinda passive agressive and I just stopped replying.

So, some of my friends dont really like my boyfriend, because we dont have a very good history(nothing too bad, don't worry, he wouldnt hurt a fly), but we are doing really good lately. And the fact that she reacted like that and also, protected this external person which I doubt she's too close to, because she kinda doent like anyone on that class really, bothered me. Literally this person could be lying and she wouldnt tell me who it was. Also, this guy didnt just tell her, he obviously told the rest of my friends who were with her on that moment, so I'm really upset because its giving a bad image of my BF to the rest of my group of friends.

Am I The Asshole for not trusting my bffs words? Or do you guys agree with me? Do you think she should have told me who told her?"	No A-holes here	1	0
bzlba3	2019-06-12 02:02:23	b480193	WIBTA for reporting my neighbor for parking in a fire-lane?	"A few weeks ago at an HOA meeting, neighbor1 mentioned they were upset that the police were called when their kid parked in a fire-lane across from their house and they felt that mysteryneighbor should have come to them first rather than calling the police. The HOA reiterated that the area was in question was a fire-lane and that it was illegal to park there.

Since then, I've noticed that there is a car parked directly next to the fire-lane sign  pretty consistently (4-5 times per week), with a second car occasionally parking in front of it or behind it, too. This is often happening while other spots are available during the day and there's also street parking available a few yards away. 

I've told my husband that I want to report to our non-emergency line as I worry it would interfere with emergency services. He thinks I should leave a note on their windshield or try to talk to them as their getting out of the car, then if it persists I call the police. I'd rather skip ahead to reporting it to the non-emergency line because (1) neighbor1 has already been warned it's illegal, (2) I'm awful at confrontation, and (3) I'm concerned about potential retaliation if I or someone else calls after I say something."

bzlamr	2019-06-12 02:00:50		AITA for telling my gf she shouldn't delete conversations she might have with other guys cause it's sketchy behavior?	"My girlfriend and I get along great. 

The only thing we disagree on is if someone messages her (usually guys, I'll let you guess why) she might talk to them out of boredom or whatever and then delete the conversation with that person.
Her reasoning is that ""Since I'm not interested in other guys, and I cut them off if they try to flirt with me, I see no problem in not mentioning that someone, even a friend, might flirt with me or not delete a conversation I had with someone else.""

My opinion on that is that if you ain't got something to hide you needn't delete a conversation. It's a bit shady to me (This might be an insecure part of myself talking because in the past I was cheated on and it left its scar on my mentality) but even friends of mine agreed with me.

bzl9l4	2019-06-12 01:57:57	EKahn04	AITA for accusing my friend of being a narcissist?	"My friend (let's call him ""Bryan"") and I (both 15M) were at a meeting for our soccer team.  This meeting had to do with our strategy for next season.  There was a period for \~15 minutes where we were just waiting for our coach to show up.  Bryan, our friends and I began to make small talk.  My other friend ""Henry"" brings up that Bryan is going to quit the team if he doesn't make varsity.

I was surprised, to say the least.  Bryan worked very hard at soccer and he was extremely dedicated.  It didn't seem like him to quit on something like this.  He began to explain himself, saying that ""I refuse to play for a team that doesn't acknowledge my true talents"" and ""every team I've played for I was a starter.""  The problem with this is that I've been on every team he's played on (club, town, and school). 

 It seemed to me he was being a bit of a Mr. Struggle, so I told him that it didn't make sense for him to quit on something he loved.  He said it was because ""the coaches are the only ones who don't know how good I am.""  He also made disparaging remarks about the JV team, which hurt because I was on that team.  Every player on that team went through the same things he did, and he was the only one who took it personally.  After he made a few remarks about how his skill level was waaaayyy above some dumb JV team, I called him out for being narcissistic.  

He flipped out at me, calling me a jealous asshole.  I was confused by this because 3 out of the four people (not including me or Bryan) thought my points were valid.

bzl9ki	2019-06-12 01:57:52	OofMyNose	WIBTA if I lied about a sports injury so people don't judge me for getting a nose job	"It's a big nose. Honestly, I quite like my face, but it gets in the way. It's very 'beaky' with a big lump halfway up, my profile is really unattractive to me

So I want to fix it, and the only thing holding me back is how people will react. My parents have very strong views against it, and I'm sure that I'm not the sort of person people would think would get cosmetic surgery. I'm really pro body positivity and I never really voice my insecurities so it makes me feel really hypocritical, but then again I'm only going to live once why not like my face

I play full contract sports, no one needs to know except me and the surgeon, so I'm just going to say that it got mashed in a scrum and as part of the fixing process they skimmed it down a little.

I guess this is a little ""am I the asshole"" , a little ""is this a stupid idea""

I've only talked to my boyfriend about this, he says he'd support me whatever, but thinks that it's a little ridiculous to deceive people and definitely very 'off-brand' for me when 1) I'm not super into my looks from an outside perspective (secretly I'm dripping with insecurity) and 2) I talk a lot of self-acceptance and this really goes against that

I was super grateful to hear of the offer but pretty much had my mind made up I didn’t want to work this summer. 

However, my parents are very old fashioned and pretty much said “he came up to offer you this, you should say yes” and I tried explaining to them my classes come first but they are not having any of it and are quite unhappy.

Terry and I go to the same college and we're part of the same social group. This social group has a group chat with nearly 50 people in it, and a bunch of us were talking about today's Nintendo Direct in the chat. Terry isn't much of a Nintendo fan, which is fine. As we were talking, he sends us the following messages:

https://imgur.com/a/I404Ppo
Note that red is Terry and Green is another person in the chat who isn't me. The Discord server he was referencing is only a couple weeks old and hasn't really taken off, which is why we still primarily use this Facebook group chat.

The conversation completely stopped after that. I was enjoying our conversation, so I was a bit bummed. After an hour or so, I decided to say something to Terry about it. Before reading the following conversation, the context you will need is that Terry and I are planning to live together in the fall with three other people. Since we are the only ones in the social group with a house, there is a lot of pressure to make our house the ""[purple] house"" which means our house is the go-to house for anyone in the group to hang out, have parties, etc. Terry doesn't want our house to be the [purple] house, so we have all agreed that it won't be.

Okay. That being said, here is the first part of our conversation:

https://imgur.com/a/O2ANMkA

At this point, he went to our social group chat, said ""Sorry for that comment, carry on.  I’m muting the chat please dm me if you need anything"" and muted the chat. I thought everything was good at this point. However, out conversation continued:

So after many years out of school, I quit my welding job to finish my last semester of my associates degree. I went back to get it because my welding job killed my soul. I worked 70+ hours a week for two year. I only got one or two days off every 6 weeks. I absolutely wanted to die after working there. 

So I quit and went back to school. I saved up enough money I can live for over a year on my savings. So I decided I could better my life by going and getting this degree. Man did I fuck up.

My elder sister borrowed my keys when she popped out of the house to hang with some friends. She lost her's and hasn't gotten them replaced yet, so she couldn't have used her own. 

&#x200B;

When she came back she brought my keys into our room along with the rest of her belongings. I asked her to hang them on the hook right outside our room where they always was when they weren't in use, so I wouldn't have to worry about it in the morning.  She said she'd do it later, but this bothered me because I'd had issues with her returning stuff in the past. ( If this needs clarification, please ask!) I didn't want to have to scramble to find it in the morning so I asked her to put them back now. ( Keep in mind I didn't voice my concerns about not being able to find it later, which in hindsight, I should've done. ) She insisted she was doing her math homework now and would get it done eventually. I kept pressing her to do it now, but she simply refused.

&#x200B;

Then, I kinda stole her pencil and told her I'd give it back once she put away her keys. This escalated into a full-scale argument.

We started talking regularly, but we never met in person as she didn't live close enough to me that I could see her in person. The more I talked to her, the more I came to like her, until one day she told me she ""loved"" me (quotation marks because neither of us knew what love really was, and I guess I still don't really know, as I am currently 16), and I said that I loved her, too. This is when we began ""dating"". We got really close, and one day she just disappeared, and stopped responding to my texts and calls. I was devastated, and just generally unhappy. As I started to push it out of my memory, About half/three quarters of a year passed, and I got a text out of the blue from her, asking if I was still there, and if I was Okay. I said yes to both, and things started back up from where we left off. I didn't ask her what happened, as I was just happy to have her back, but I was always on guard in case it happened again. Another couple months pass, we get closer, and I let my guard down. I feel happy, and I talk to her almost every day. Then, she disappears. Like the idiot I Am, I completely let my guard down, and I was devastated again. Three, maybe four months pass, and I get a message from her, that just said ""hey"". I decided I wasn't gonna let this happen again, and blocked/deleted her from everything I had. I felt terrible, bad enough that I considered going back to her but forced myself not to. At first, guilt was eating me, and it really showed in my behavior and school marks, but I never told anyone. I have gotten over it (I think), but I still find myself occasionally thinking about it and feeling guilty.

My husband and I got into the weirdest argument earlier. We're cutrently travelling; he's working and I'm along for the ride (shopping).

I also picked up vodka and Bloody Mary mix for the room and cans of the beer he likes.

Once we're both back in the room earlier, we both had a Bloody Mary making the only two glasses in the room dirty. He had a dinner to go to shortly thereafter and asked that I go to a store nearby and pick up some regular water for him. Rough recreation of the conversation as follows (H = husband):

Me: I'll get you water but why not drink what's in the fridge? 
H: I don't want that, can you just get water?
Me: You've never said you didn't like sparkling water before so if you're not going to drink any I've probably bought too much.
(side note: were flying to/from our destination so I can't take extra with me)
H: I don't want that shit. Can you just get the water? There is a store in the next block.
Me: Yes I'll get it but I just don't understand why all of a sudden you won't drink the sparkling water.
H: *voice raised* Jesus christ. Because I don't want to drink bubbly water if I'm hung over.
Me: Oh OK. That explains it. I'll go get some while you're at dinner.
H: *turns around to computer* Jesus christ.

H: Yes. Jesus christ.
Me: Oh my God. Do you see how you go from 0-60 over NOTHING?
H: *yells something pointing out everything he does for me and I can't even get him water and storms out to get it himself*

Ok, so a little bit of backstory first.
When I was 7 my mom remarried and I was introduced to my new siblings: 

Mike- a year older
Lucy- a year younger

At first everything was great and we got a long well, but everything changed as soon as puberty came along.

Lucy started to gain a ton of weight and developed acne since she always sucked at keeping up with her personal hygiene. 

As for me, I never considered myself to be attractive when I was growing up since I mostly resembled Jack skeleton, but as it turns out I was just an extremely late bloomer whose body started to develop only a year before entering highschool.

Now, for the actual story, while growing up Lucy always relied on me when it came down to her personal problems (she suffers from terrible body image issues among other problems). I listened to her and tried to help however I could, at some point we even began joking that I was her personal therapist.

After my sudden growth spurt Lucy changed. She began making passive aggressive remarks about my body or looks and talk behind my back only to act like nothing happened when she needed me to be her ""therapist"" for a while.

Ex: ""You should thankful, he is chasing after you because you are pretty"" (after hearing about how a guy from highschool began stalking and harassing me after I rejected him)

The shit finally hit the fan at this years annual family camping trip where we had to share a tent.

I fell asleep first, only to be woken up by Lucy hitting me and telling me to move, I did as I was told and moved to the very edge of the tent when I was suddenly hit again, the interaction went something like this:

Me: now fully awake ""what the hell??""

Lucy: ""you can't even move a little you narcissistic bitch?"" 

I know the situation might be childish but for me this was the last straw. 

Mike tells me that I should just forgive her and move forward since I'm graduating highschool and will not see much of her after I join the army. Most of my step family agrees with him.

I never thought me cutting her off was a bad thing to do but lately I've been having tons of doubts. I know that not supporting Lucy can cause her to regain a ton of issues she had, but at the same time it's not really my job nor am I qualified for it.

*Short: puberty hit me like a track which caused my step sister to start harassing me. I help her deal with a lot of personal issues and I know that without my help her situation will only get worse. Nevertheless, I'm tired of her harassment and I'm cutting her off."	Not the A-hole	1	0

bzkw0s	2019-06-12 01:19:41	honeygarlicribsssss	AITA for refusing call outs at work?	"Throwaway account since my coworkers are following me on my main one. So basically, I've been working at one of my bosses side projects for the past 3 weeks. Work is slow now so that's why I'm working on this project for the time being. I'm not allowed overtime for this project which sucks, bit I am fine with it, since he's paying out of pocket for this and it's better than nothing.  

On Sunday morning one of my project managers (not my boss), texted me and asked if I wanted to work out of town for the week. I told him ""yes I would love to work out of town for a change, let me know and I will reschedule my dentist appointment"". He said ""okay, sounds good you can reschedule, I'll have you going out of town from Monday to Friday with *coworkers 1, 2, & 3* "".

 I canceled/rescheduled plans that I had this week including the dentist appointment, and I packed all my stuff up. I received a text from PM saying ""hey nevermind, I'll just have you working at the project house this week"". I told him ok that's fine, I just assumed the job must have got canceled or something. 

Fast forward to Monday morning, I get to the shop and the PMs nephew who is here for the summer says to me ""hey you going out of town too?"" I told him no I'm not. So when everyone was getting dispatched to their jobs, in comes PM and he tells all the same people I was supposed to go with that they're going out of town, except PMs nephew is in my place.

I was a bit annoyed but I put up with it. I mentioned it to one of my coworkers who works in the office, she told me PM texted his nephew that morning but couldn't get a hold of him so he asked me. His nephew finally responded later that night so that's when PM told me I'm not going anymore. This made me flat out mad because I was nice enough to cancel and reschedule plans and appointments this week to fill in his nephews spot when he couldn't get a hold of anyone, only to get told never mind once nephew finally responded. 

I thought about it for a bit and realized that PM sent everyone who is on call this week out of town. I got a call from PM that saying he couldn't find anyone to go to a call out and needed me there asap. I told him ""sorry I can't go, I'm not gonna cancel my plans a second time, ask the on call people"". He told me ""they're out of town and can't go"" so I wished him good luck finding someone and hung up.

When I was talking to my family that night I mentioned what happened and how even though I could use the money, I'm willing to miss out on the OT pay because I refuse to let myself be treated like that. If PM wants to be a flake to me like that in favor of his nephew then he can go to the call outs himself for all I care. Its not my problem that he sent the on call people out of town. 

My family members told me I was blowing it out of proportion and being rude, and that I should have helped him out since he's probably stressing out about who to send. We then got in an argument over this. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

This year I'm having a lot of issues deciding on a decent gift for her. 

   A little information on her: she is not a pleasant woman in my eyes. She works long hours and then comes home and drinks her vodka cranberry and plays candy crush until her eyes bleed. She doesn't have friends other than her boyfriend and her main characteristic is being an alcoholic, but she wont admit that. She doesn't have hobbies, she doesn't cook, she wont do anything remotely exciting on her weekends, all she does is either watch TV shows about pools she'll never be able to afford and haunting TV shows. I have come to realize that if I get her alcohol she will probably twist it into me calling her an alcoholic as she drowns herself in the bottle I get her. If I get her anything involving cleaning she'll tell me I'm lazy. If I get her non Victoria secrets clothes she'll think I'm judging how she dresses. I'm just at a loss.

I’ve known this person since the beginning of freshman year (now I’m going to be a senior). I felt like we were decent friends at first, but then over time I felt sort of distant to him, we just don’t really have anything in common, however he feels that we’re good friends. A few months ago, over text, I told him how I felt about our friendship, saying that I didn’t feel a strong bond. Then not too long after, I believe he brought up hanging out, but I told him again how I felt (this was in person). 

Just a day or two ago he asked when we could hang out again since it’s summer break. I felt like I made myself clear when I told him how I felt, but idk. I‘m probably going to have explain sooner or later again anyways. W/AITA for not responding?

Edit: Grammar, and some info that might be relevant. He might have some memory problems, because I can recall on multiple occasions him asking me questions that I’ve answered many times before (like what day my birthday is) so I don’t *think* he’s asking again to guilt me or anything like that."

bzkoll	2019-06-12 00:58:34		AITA for getting annoyed when my roommate watches TV?	"I have lived with the same roommate for a couple years and we get along really well. We aren’t super close and don’t hang out much but it’s fun when we occasionally do and we usually have a pretty good passing relationship. 

The first year I lived with her, I realized her parents have done EVERYTHING for her. Cook, clean, wake her up for school...pay her rent. Everything. She is extremely reliant on them and it shows. She has never once taken out the trash, cleaned a common room or provided common use items like hand soap for the bathroom or cleaning supplies. I am a little bit of a neat freak so I don’t mind doing all the cleaning since it’s largely for my own benefit. 

I also furnished the entire apartment (kitchen, common areas) with her promise of paying me back. She never did, which I was annoyed with but is fine since I’ll be able to keep and resell the furniture. I also recently purchased a TV in addition to a few subscriptions, like Netflix and Hulu. Additionally, I pay for WiFi. 

I’m very tolerant of her not contributing much to the apartment overall since she is rarely here. However, when she is here, she makes large messes, leaves dishes in the sink for over a week and seems to have no regard for the fact that she doesn’t contribute to the cleanliness or the furnishings of the apartment. 

AITA for being super annoyed when she watches TV in the living room? WIBTA if I asked her not to use it? 

I know it’s a common space, which is why I’m worried I’m the asshole, but it truly infuriates me. If she paid for half or even cleaned up her mess (throw pillows all over the floor, dishes and shoes left on the couch) I wouldn’t mind at all. I have addressed similar things with her before, asking her to help clean and such but she has never changed her habits of doing nothing. I don’t really want to look for a new roommate since we are usually pretty well, but I didn’t sign up to be her mom. Any suggestions for handling this would be greatly appreciated."		1	0
bzkofv	2019-06-12 00:58:11	LiamFN	AITA for shoulder bumping an old lady?	"Happened a few months ago, but friends still like to bring it up.

I was walking on the sidewalk of a shopping centre with a friend of mine. There was a road block in front, which made it so that there were a lot of barriers and only a quite small part of the sidewalk (which is normally huge) was available. The rest was surrounded by fences. There was maybe room for 2.5 people, at max 3 in a row.

So me and the friend saw this, and he walked behind me so we wouldn't take up unnecessary space.

Two old ladies were walking in the opposite direction towards us in this same corridor, and they clearly saw us. However they were walking side by side, not even as far to the right as they could've been, and they just showed no signs of stopping for me. So instead of going up to the wall and letting them by, I decided to just walk like I normally would, as far to the right as possible still, at normal speed. I shoulder bumped the lady quite hard, I think she said something but to be fair I just walked on.

The old ladies were maybe 65. I am 19.

bzkn7n	2019-06-12 00:54:28	Shadowx21	AITA for telling my girl to slow down on sending her parents money?	Quick little backstory me and my girl have been together about a year now. Shes got a 9-5 job so she’s not broke per-say but she kind of struggles saving money due to rent and few bills . Now, her parents live in another country where her dad works a decent paying job. Now here’s the thing, her mom is constantly asking her for money saying they need to pay bills and what not. Now before you make up your mind with that sentence believe me, I am all up for helping family out as long as they got your back too but they don’t have a house payment, they don’t have a car payment, and their bellies are full every night. There are three times that I recall that really made me wonder. One time she had asked for about 200$ okay that’s cool they “need money”, one month later we “need 500 because we are going out of town” okay really? You just gave them money now they want to go out of town? If you wanna have fun it’s because you’ve already got money saved right? And just now, her mom is coming to the US to visit her sister in another state and she “needs money for bills back home” I’m really thinking it’s bullshit. How do you go on vacation and ask for money???!!! You’re going on vacation just to see your daughter if you really need money for bills you don’t go! What do you guys think? I always tell her that her money is hers obviously but I think it’s ridiculous. I’m just telling her what I observe . I’m not telling her to stop helping out but give them when you truly know they need it. Not when they call you often asking for it. Oh I should mention her older sister doesn’t give them shit. Her mom never asks her even though her sister lives comfortably.	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzkmz9	2019-06-12 00:53:48	romancandle4	WIBTA for telling my Mom to stop mentioning our dead dog	A while back (4 months give or take) My golden retriever named bella died of a tumor. It was very devastating for the whole family (except my much younger brother who doesn't quite understand the concept of death) Well I was especially devastated because I knew her since I was seven and essentially grew up with her. My way of dealing with loss is repression. It took me about a week to actually kinda forget about her (a week is actually a really long time for me, it only took me about a day or two for other family members I have lost) but whenever I hear her name or remember her it causes slight emotional pain. But it isn't much a problem since we stored all her toys and stuff downstairs and I barely see anything that reminds me of her, except of course my Mom  brings her up alot. She will sneak it into conversations when she has the chance. But most of the time it's when she sees another dog. Sometimes she will stop a stranger while they are walking their dog and compliment the dog and then proceed to talk about bella. I think it's how she copes with things, by talking about it with anyone she can. The only problem is it intervenes with my coping process and reopens the wound. I want her to be able to get over it but at the same time I also wanna be able to not suddenly be sad when she mentions her.	Asshole	0	0
bzkmn1	2019-06-12 00:52:51	reallygreatscott	aita for not clapping or standing for a military reunion?	" 

At an award ceremony for my middle schoolers for things like grades, perfect attendance, orchestra, sports. This school is in a city just outside a large Army base. The school is made up of probably 50/50 civilian/military kids. This is a huge Army base. In addition to Army, we have a very small number Navy and Air Force here as well. I myself am military (19 years Army).

The awards ceremony was going well, kids were being called up, pictures taken, people clapping. There was commotion backstage, curtains moving, and some confusion on the stage itself. The ceremony paused and then another kids name was called. This particular kid was called onstage, and instead of the principal handing him his award, an Air Force Captain handed him his award. The kid and this captain hugged and it was announced that, his dad had returned from a 6 month deployment a few weeks early, so that he could surprise his kid at this ceremony. This dad then grabbed his sons hand, held it up like a prize fighter and ref in a boxing match win. Lots of cheering from the crowd, standing ovation. After a pause, the other kids just got their name called and kept the line moving, lots of kids, little time. Not me though, I didn't stand or clap. After the ceremony, this particular Captain stood with his son by the auditorium exit doors talking to his family. He stood close enough to the doors that he would be noticed and congratulated and thanked by just about everyone passing by, but far enough away from the door that he didn't look like he was waiting for it. My wife congratulated him, thanked him for his service and scorned at me when I declined to do the same.

In the I was asked why I didn't shake his hand and congratulate him and his son. My answer was:

We have been deployed multiple times since 2001, it's not a big deal anymore.

I can't watch CNN or Fox news or any other news source without seeing some dad or mom jumping out of a box at their kids school or throwing a baseball out at their sons little league game or some ridiculous ""look at me stunt"" trying to get attention and I am sick and tired of it.

It was a 6 month deployment, AND it ended early for them.

There were over 100 kids at this event, each with their own story, why feel the need to steal their thunder.

These reunions aren't about the kid, it the service member making it about themselves.

There is no draft, it's a job, he volunteered, got paid, knew what he was getting into, it was less than 6 months, and came home uninjured. No different than any other job out there.

My wife has deemed me an asshole, she won't argue with any of my points in particular, but has deemed me an asshole in general over this. She says her friends and coworkers agree with her, but I think she is just saying that, doubt she asked them. I returned with ""I guarantee everyone at my work would agree with me""

bzkmjz	2019-06-12 00:52:36	UnfairTeams	AITA for refusing to play a game if the teams will be stacked against me?	"Throwaway because my friends know my main Reddit account.


Some necessary background information:

There is a team-based video game that my friends and I often play together, where it is possible to switch teams mid-game. Because of this mechanic, it’s possible to set up the game so that the teams have an uneven amount of players (for example, 2 vs 4). As I have been playing the game for a lot longer than anyone else, I happen to be one of the better players, and the team I am on tends to win more often than not. 


The situation:

Lately my friends have started stacking the teams a little bit against me in order to make up for the skill gap, so that each team has a relatively equal chance to win. This was fine at first, because it’s more fun for all of us. However it has gotten to the point where if my team starts to win, they move a player from my team to the other team.  Because of this, I have ended up losing the majority of our recent games. From my perspective this is very unfair, because I feel like I am being punished for being good at the game. As such, I’ve told them that I will not be playing with them anymore unless they stop purposely stacking teams against me. 

The others are claiming that I need to stop complaining and just enjoy the game, but I find it difficult to have fun if the others are purposely making the game unfair to prevent me from winning, despite the fact that I am playing better than any of them. 

If it’s relevant, most of us do play competitively; this isn’t the case where some want to play casually and some want to play competitively. Their main counter argument when I claim the stacked teams are unfair is that if they didn’t stack the teams against me, the game would be unfair in my favour since I am a better player / have more experience than them. 

So Reddit, AITA for being upset and refusing to play until they stop stacking teams?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzkm7u	2019-06-12 00:51:37	tayh28	AITA for going on a date at the same concert as my dad?	"Backstory: My [22F] mom passed away about a year and a half ago. Since then, my family has all been grieving and moving forward in our own ways, and my dad [53M] has started going on dates/meeting new women, let’s call her Marie. My sister and I haven’t met her but are totally fine with this, we just want him to be open with us.

For a few months now, he’s been “seeing” the same woman. They don’t have a label on their relationship, and they’re not looking to put one on it. They’re definitely more than friends, but not quite dating. Again, this is fine with me.

Personally, I’m not looking to commit to anything quickly either. But, right before I moved home after graduating college I went on a date with a guy and we have stayed in touch since, let’s call him Jack. He is staying in the town we went to college in and I’m at home (about a 2 hour drive away). What I’ve told people (including both Jack and my dad) is that I’m not looking to build a relationship in a long distance situation, but if either of us happen to be in the others town and we’re both free, I’d enjoy getting together.

A few weeks ago, my dad let me know that he was going to a concert with Marie. Good for him! But yesterday, Jack mentioned his family had tickets to the same concert and I asked if I wanted to go. I said yes, thinking it could be fun to see a new band.

I texted my dad to let him know I got invited to go too and he called me soon after. He immediately expressed discomfort with the situation. He started telling me he didn’t really want me to go and be in the same place as him and Marie. He said it was weird that the first time I could potentially meet her would be when they were on a date.

He went as far to say that if I decided to go, he wouldn’t tell Marie that I’m there. He said it would make her too self conscious. When I mentioned it was Jack who asked me to the concert he asked “well you’re just lukewarm on this guy anyways, do you really have to go?”. I’m now uncomfortable with the fact that he’s trying to hide me and talk me out of a fun experience because he’s in a weird situation relationship wise.

I told him that I wanted to go and that if I happened to see him there, I would just ignore him. I just don’t feel like his relationship with Marie should impact me going and having fun at a concert. When the conversation was settled, my dad seemed displeased with my decision, but let it be. Anyone I’ve asked for opinions on the situations has said it’s weird that I was asked not to go and that I should go anyways. Again, I feel like I should be able to go, but I’m worried that it’s disrespectful to go against what my dad wants. So AITA for going anyways?

TL;DR: My dad is in a new “relationship” with a woman, and I got invited on a date to the same concert they’re going to. He asked me not to go because she’d be uncomfortable, but I told him I’m going anyways."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzklue	2019-06-12 00:50:31		AITA for wanting my best friends to just co-exist	"So, we’re having a graduation party after commencement with my friends. It’s a bit of a complicated story but essentially my two best friends (let’s call them Lisa and Ashley) hate each other from a high school feud. I’ve had to separate tables at my birthday party so they wouldn’t have to sit next to each other. Lisa is okay with being civil with Ashley by saying hi and then ignoring her for the night but Ashley just does not want to be in Lisa’s presence. Ashley and I had a joint birthday party this year where I obviously invited Lisa because it was my birthday too. There was no drama and everything was fine. But now Ashley is claiming it was awkward and she had to avoid someone at her own birthday which I thought was unfair since it was also my birthday. 

Now to the party, since Ashley and I graduated from the same program, we’ll both be celebrating along with 3 other friends at a club. I invited Lisa because she already took a day off to go downtown and take pics so might as well celebrate with us. But Ashley has a problem with this and said I went behind her back and didn’t consider her feelings and made me feel pretty terrible. Now she’s saying she won’t be coming to the party and is going to instead do her own thing with her boyfriend. 

Lisa doesn’t have a problem with coming because she’ll be there to celebrate with me and can put their differences aside but Ashley says she can never be good with her. Obviously Ashley needs to be there and I convinced her to come. I asked Ashley to let me know if she doesn’t want Lisa there that bad and I’ll tell her not to come but it isn’t sitting well with me. Am I the asshole for wanting my two best friends to be able to coexist? And I know, I know, I’m never going to have a joint party ever again. 

Btw were all 24f and the beef occurred at 17-18 so it just all seems like petty, childish behaviour. I just want to have them both part of important moments in my life."		1	0
bzklk5	2019-06-12 00:49:50	sdakfjklashf	WIBTA for no longer being friends with someone who I have feelings for?	"This is a pretty straightforward one. 

Sometime in late January I started to talking to this girl at my college, and we hit it off pretty immediately and started hanging out a lot. I really liked her, so I asked her out after a few weeks had passed. She said she wasn't interested, but she'd like to still be friends. I thought this would be fine, as I barely knew her at the time and thought I could pretty easily kill those feelings. But then some months passed and I started to really like her, and by this point she'd become one of my closest friends. I did my best to ignore these feelings, but then one day they bubbled up and I couldn't ignore them any longer. I had to see, just one more time, if there was any chance she felt the same way. So I asked her if she did, and was again rejected, but this time it hard. I'd grown to develop some really strong feelings for this girl, so hearing that she didn't feel the same really hurt. But I dealt with it, and tried to move on as if nothing had changed. At this point it was pretty close to summer, so I figured I could keep hanging out with her, acting as if I'd moved on from her rejection, and then once the summer came, I'd be able to get over her for real. But here's the problem: it's been a month since I left for vacation and I still think about her daily. I've texted her a lot, but she travels and lives abroad, so we've only been able to call each other like twice. You'd figure with minimal contact I'd be able to forget about her. But I can't shake this one part of me that wants to believe that maybe she'll change her mind, even though I know realistically that that's not going to happen. I honestly feel like I can't even think about flirting with other girls as long as I feel like this, and whenever I think of her maybe being with some other dude in Morocco, I get so mad and jealous that I can't stand it. I feel trapped, like I can't move on with my life as long as the two of us remain friends. So I'm considering calling her and telling her that we can't be friends anymore. But after months of hanging out, this feels like it would be unfair to just out of the blue stop being friends with her. WIBTA?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bzkli8	2019-06-12 00:49:40	sadwaterbottle2019	AITA For getting upset at my friend who is trying to set up my crush with someone else?	"My friend (D) and I, who have known each other for almost three years. are both going to university but we're taking a summer class together at a community college. We have a few other friends in this class, including his friend (A). D is gay, and I am a bisexual woman (this is important later on).  


The first day of class, I noticed there was a really pretty girl sitting at our table. I invited her to be in our lab group and since then we all hang out every day. I expressed to D that I had a bit of a crush on her after a couple of weeks of getting to know her. A few days ago, D told me that he was trying to set up the girl with his friend (A). I told him that I would get really jealous and that we weren't even sure if she's straight. Whenever I flirt with her, she flirts back. But D was adamant and said, ""I'm positive she's straight."" But then he told me that he never even asked her. This rubbed me the wrong way because since D and I are both members of the LGBT+ community, I thought he would understand that we shouldn't assume other people's sexuality.   


Today I was driving D to work after class (which I do everyday and he doesn't offer gas money or say thank you, but that's beside the point) and he again brought up trying to set up my crush with A. I told told him that it hurt my feelings that he was trying to do this, especially because I had already told him that I had a crush on her and he had previously told me that he wasn't sure if A would be interested. D told him that if the roles were reversed then his feelings wouldn't be hurt so mine shouldn't be either. I tried to explain that we're two different people with very different emotions and that I felt like my feelings were being invalidated since he kept saying he was still going to try to get them together. Then he started to say that he was sorry, but then said, ""Actually, I'm not going to apologize because that would mean that I'm wrong."" Then he went on to say ""She (the girl) isn't that great and neither is A so I think they would be better together, anyways.""  


So I'm upset for several reasons. First, for assuming that the girl is straight. If she is straight, I'm not interested in trying anything to ""turn"" her (which I don't believe in) but I still do like her and I can't help it. Second, D refused to apologize even though I told him that my feelings were hurt that he is trying to get my crush with a guy who hasn't expressed interest in her. I'm not going to force him to apologize but he told me that he's still going to try to get them together. My crush's sexuality aside, it still hurts that he would do this in front of me (A is also in our lab group and hangs out with us every day).  


After I dropped him off at work I thought about texting him but changed my mind because I don't think there's anything left to say.  So Reddit, WIBTA if I told him that I wasn't interested in being friends with him since he seems to have no regard for my feelings and that he needed to find another way to work?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzklde	2019-06-12 00:49:17	whatyoulikegirls	"AITA for saying ""phew"" after my friend confirmed and said he wasn't into me?"	"I'll try to be as clear and concise as possible.

So lately my dating life has been in a rough spot, won't really get into it. I have (or maybe had) a super close friend (male) who I've known for years, never had any romantic interest in, but he's always been there for me when I'm going through a rough time like with the stuff I mentioned above and a great shoulder, and it pains me to think that I may have just lost him (or upset him somehow).

So he also had a bad breakup several months ago and has been 'playing the field'. Maybe it was just me being paranoid but I felt I was getting mixed signals from him. He's been inviting me on outings and gotten slightly more close, but he could just be genuinely looking out for me after what I've recently been through.

I guess the other night while we were hanging out smoking, he kinda read into that he might be coming off that way when he noticed I was a bit hesitant and eventually said something along the lines of ""hey, I'm not interested like that or trying to get with you or anything, I actually have a date tomorrow"". I was instantly relieved and said ""Phew! Thank god!""

He then gave me a weird look and was kinda passive the rest of the night, after that it's been nearly a week and I haven't heard from him at all.

I wasn't sure if maybe he was lying, or if there was something wrong with what I said or how I said it. I talked to my other (female) friend about it and she seems to think what I said wasn't cool regardless of whether he was into me or not.

bzkkeo	2019-06-12 00:46:25		AITA because my friend got arrested and I was released?	"So here goes: me and my buddies (4 of us) went to a local college for a night of partying.  We were drinking, smoking etc and then we ended up buying a few grams of blow.  We did a gram or two together and then we split up, 2 buddies stayed at the college and me and other friend go back to the car at 3:30am. I still had about a gram or so left because I threw in the most money. 

When walking back to the car (in a busy Saturday night college  parking lot) a local police car was cruising the lot and spotted us.  We tried to act natural, as if we weren’t trying to get in the car and drive home.  Cop drove away and we got in the car, friend was driving and I was passenger.  As soon as we started driving, cop was suddenly on our ass.  Sensing we were about to get bagged, I put the little gram baggie in between a few pages of the owners manual in the glove box (stupid idea, probably should’ve ingested it one way or another).  I told my buddy to not let the cops search the vehicle and he agreed.  Cop immediately pulls us over.  This is where the AITA lines get blurry...

Cop is ridiculously nice to us, tells us to pull into the closest parking lot and call for a ride to pick us up.  My buddy drives right past the entrance to the lot and pulls on some random grassy spot.  Cop is still super nice to us, I call my GF and she agrees to come pick us up ASAP.  We’re sitting there with the cop, and he gets another call.  He says he needs to leave, and we need to stay put until our ride arrives.  As soon as the cop car is outta sight, my buddy takes off at high speed.  College is a solid 10+ minutes from the highway.  We make it all the way to the on ramp, and then see the blue lights in the rear view.  Pulled over on the side of on ramp, cops cuff and stuff us both in separate cruisers and search the vehicle.  They find a glass bowl, hidden knife and yup, you guessed it, the blow.

My buddy has called his GF to say he’s getting his first DWI and I call my GF to tell her to pick me up at police station instead of college.  When being processed we were both shown the evidence against us, I did NOT admit “actually officers that’s my cocaine you found in the glovebox.”  He wasn’t charged with anything else besides possession, and I was released with no charges.  

I feel bad about the whole situation, but we were already given a break when the cop let us go the first time. It was his idiotic idea to make a run for it, and he got caught. I did not encourage him to drive away and even said it was a stupid idea when he did it.  Long story short, his GF’s dad is a high power defense attorney and got him off with a small fine that his parents paid anyway.  I didn’t see the need to speak up and incriminate myself, and it obviously ended our friendship. 

So I know this is a tricky one, but AITA?

Found out there's a group chat without my wife and I that none of our roommates let us know about. We've definitely grown apart from our friend group some, but this feels like a low blow. I found out from my roommate showing me something from the group chat, and then got flighty when he realized I wasn't in it and tried to hide it.

We offered to let one of our current roommates come live with us at a very reasonable rate (about 2/3 going rate for the area, with utilities included).

"I’m throwing my birthday party soon and I invited a friend who doesn’t drive. She asked me if I could give her a ride home and I said no because I’m more than likely going to be drinking at this party and I wouldn’t feel safe or ethical driving someone home while under the influence. Tried to get some other friends to give her a ride to no avail. I suggested taking a lyft or an uber, to which she asked if we can split one. I still said no because I’m honestly not sure when my party will wrap and I usually stay up late when I hang out at my buddy’s place (location of the party). I told her I figured we would just take separate ones that way each of us can leave whenever we want. She then told me she’s never used lyft before and she’s fearful of getting in a car alone. I told her I had the same fear many years ago and I’ve used the service plenty with no problems. She said she would get back to me but I have a hunch she’s not going to go through with it. So she won’t come to my party unless I don’t drink and give her a ride or leave early and split a lyft. I feel very conflicted because I’m excluding her but at the same time I feel as though I shouldn’t have to be the DD and chaperone someone at my birthday party. Am I The Asshole?

"For context: I'm in Washington DC right now, and my family loves me, there's no tense relations or feuds right now. This is a family vacation, we are all constantly on the move, like GO GO GO to the metro, to a bus, things like that. The stories: I was at the Air and Space mueseum, and a tour with a docent just started. However, I just started wandering around, lost in thought. I love history, and the mueseum had a lot of it. Then I wandered to far. My Dad came to me, and said ""This is a family vacation, and you don't want to be with us?"" I said back, ""I didn't think of it that way."" Then he said: ""It's insulting what you did."" I said back: ""I had no bad intent."" I wanted to apologize and explain I got lost in thought, and I want to rejoin, but my Dad said: ""Don't come back, just go away and do your own thing, people will think I just forced you to join."" I rejoined the tour anyways. I answered a trivia question the docent asked, everyone cheered, and even my Dad. He wanted to fist bump, but I left him hanging. My dad said: ""Are you leaving me hanging"" I replied: ""Yes."" I kept following the tour later, then My Mom and Dad left for 10 minutes. Then they returned. To describe the tour, My Grandparents were happy and didn't even seem displeased in a subtle way, I also asked the docent so many questions throughout the entire tour, and talked so much that he gave me a complementary patch before we left. My Dad seemed to keep his distance when he returned though. If anyone wants to see the patch, I'll post it on my profile. LATER THAT DAY: I'm on the Metro, returning to the motel. My Dad often complained about the motel, and often commented on the low quality of the motel. He even laughed about comments I made in the past. He called the motel: ""The Dump"" at one point. Now, on The Metro, I made a joke about the motel, calling it ""The Dump"", and my Dad got agitated and said: ""I tried my best"". (My Dad organized the vacation, but i thought it was ok to joke about the motel because he joked about the motel.)

I’m 20F and in college. Parents pay for tuition, everything. I have no money to just move out so please don’t suggest that (something I’ve seen a lot.) My parents value education so they pay for my everything and have never let me get a basic job. The goals they’ve raised me to have also don’t align with moving out at 18 and drowning in student debt. I am eternally grateful and hope to repay them one day.

The problem: my mom has no sense of boundaries and still treats me like a child. She sees me as her investment, thus feels I owe her all details of my life. I don’t feel comfortable sharing much with her - my mom is an obsessive worrier with OCD and anxiety issues (my parents will never face that). 

Examples: my mom constantly tries to give me herbal supplements to enhance my brain. She gets mad when I don’t take them bc she says if they do no harm, I can at least try them out. She constantly goes through my room. I’ve saved up a bit of money from internships and she gets mad when I buy even a shirt or anything for my hobbies with my own money. She lost her mind when I bought tampons bc they’ll give me cervical cancer. Etc.

I feel I cant say shit - they take care of me completely. However I feel controlled, like I’m still a kid. No matter how many boundaries I set she doesn’t understand. Saying “Mind your own business” is the phrase that makes my mom lose her SHIT. AITA for saying that?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

I've known my best friend since 5th grade, and she's not allowed to date anyone. She's had boyfriends behind her mom's back, which I didn't say anything about. 

Recently, BF(best friend) got a job working at a fast food restaurant. She's 14, 15 in a few months. After a week or so she told me about a guy she's interested in. She said he's been flirting with her. Touching her arm, winking, etc. He keeps trying to get her number or trying to make her open a Snapchat to talk with him. Which, in my opinion, is pretty creepy in itself. Then it gets worse-

I learned the guy is 19. She's been telling me not to tell anyone because she doesn't want to get in trouble, but honestly I'm so worried about her and I'm not sure who to tell. At this rate, if she keeps trying to go on a date with him, I'm going to have to tell her mom and risk her getting in trouble.

Always putting her brother(my husband) down. I really don’t want to have her involved in my life. In 2014 when we were living overseas, our daughter was born via c section and husbands mom offered to come out and help us with the baby. We accepted since we were young and first time parents. MIL came and brought SIL. SIL threw fits over not getting to go out much and fits over husband and I sleeping when baby slept. MIL ended up not helping much and we asked her if she would mind watching the baby while we went for a date since we would be overseas for two more years and didn’t trust babysitters. She agreed. Husband and I went out and SIL broke our tv by throwing her phone at it. She claimed she thought her phone would break instead. Had to go buy a tv before we left for the date. So we were running late. We are dinner on our date and had tickets to a movie after. SIL began texting my husband calling him a P.O.S. and saying we were taking advantage of their mom and only wanted her out there to “watch his kid”. She said she was going to take our new replacement tv and throw it off our second story apartment balcony.  So we got a refund on our movie tickets and went home.

apologized. She also treats our daughter like a disease because she’s super into astrology and she hates Gemini’s.

I already feel crappy for not liking her and holding these things against her. I just want to cut her out of my life because I have a lot of anger towards her that I can’t forgive or forget and it’s not healthy for me. And every time she’s rude/immature or when she broke our tv and ruined our only date we would have for years, my in laws just say “eh that’s just (name)!” Nobody holds her accountable for the crappy things she’s done. 
Oh. And she got mad at me for not letting her sit in the front passenger seat in our car during their visit. I had a fresh c section and didn’t want to be squished between baby car seat and their mom. She’s almost 25 and refers to herself as the princess.

bzkaw0	2019-06-12 00:19:39	MermaidNik	AITA for telling my sister she's selfish?	"It'll be hard to make this brief, but I'll try. My sister (38) has four kids. Her oldest, who is 19, lives with our mother and has for about six months now. My sister has been married and divorced 3 times and switches from one guy to the next very rapidly. My nieces and nephews have been moved all over the country because some of the men she was with were in the military. My sister never provided my them with stability and has been on and off various drugs over the years. At one point we thought she was bi-polar, but she was actually (and still is) abusing aderrall. Can't hold down a job, lives off the government, etc.

My mom took my niece in because my sister lives in a tiny house, there was barely room for her, my sister was constantly accusing her of things, making her parent the other kids, etc. My mom was worried about my niece's mental wellbeing as well as her future.

For a couple months now, my niece has been complaining of migraines and vision problems. She had no health insurance and only a minimum wage job.  My mom paid out of her own pocket to take her to the doctor and they said it was just migraines. My sister didn't seem to care much, didn't help or even sympathize with my niece.

Fast forward to last month and thanks to my mom taking my niece's health seriously, we found out she has a large brain tumor. 

Suddenly, my sister has dedicated her Facebook page to how hard this is for her having a child with cancer. She started fundraisers, including a GoFundMe, within hours of the diagnosis (I lashed out at her and reported it and it was shut down within hours). But she is now starting other fundraisers. With all of the fundraisers, she has written a sob story about how hard it is paying bills because she can't work because of my niece's cancer and the medical bills she'll be getting (she won't be financially responsible for them), etc. Nowhere did she mention my niece doesn't live with her. Someone even started a meal train thinking they were helping my niece, but the food wasn't even going to my mom's house! She took a ton of pictures of my niece in her hospital bed and posted them all over social media without my niece's permission. My niece is quiet and won't stand up to her.

To make a very long story short, I texted my sister and was pretty mean. I told her this being the victim is ridiculous and that every dime of that money had better go directly to my niece. I accused her of being selfish and profiting from my niece's cancer and making this all about her. She basically replied and accused me of trying to hurt her.

bzk9qt	2019-06-12 00:16:24		AITA for not sleeping with a girl who's boyfriend just died	"I (M21) was good friends with a girl lets call her ""S""
While growing up in my hometown. S had a friend lets call him ""C"" who we also grew up with 
I was never really to found of C but we had mutual friends while growing up so we would end up hanging out  for a couple of months in my sophmore year of Highschool.

Fast forward to this year 2019 ive been out of highscool for 5 years and C has just passed away. Come to find out S and C had been dating so i go ti his candle vigil out of respect

This thing was emotional every one was in tears especially S. I being a good friend to her stick by her side the entire time. She really needed help ive never seen a person so broken so me doing my best to be her butler was the least I could do for a day. At the end we all got drunk as hell because C was a party animal and we all agreed that what he would have wanted.

With the drinks flowing the mood had shifted every one was more bubbly and sharing the funniest memories they had with C.  Well im sitting next to S during one of these stories and during the middle she started getting closer i think nothing of it. Starts holding me and laying her head on me. Im genuinely thinking man she really must need a hug... Nope she places her hand on my croutch and squeezes my penis.

Im not a guy that shy's away from sexual advances, but i felt something never known to me embarrassment . My heart began to race, my skin is dark but im pretty sure it was a visible bright red at this point. In a panic I quickly get up and run to the restroom. Over the next night it haunts me but my thought processe is that she was drunk, I was drunk, WE were drunk. I repeatedly  told myself im not a ""Dead Friend Fucker"". The next  i was leaving town so i went to her house to say goodbye

I knock on her door and wait for her to answer. She asks who it is and I say its me. Then for some reason she doesnt open the door im thinking what the crap.  So i knock again as she opends it i can see she has on green panties and a green braw.... NO SHIRT NO PANTS. This chick literally grabs my shirt and pulls me in the door before slamming it shut. Im screaming No No No No , but S is not giving up she trying to pin me to the ground . So now were wrestling like wwe and im ashamed to say it but my dick was hard as a rock. The moment she sees it she says  ""You do want to fuck me your dick doesnt lie "". I say nothing and we just stare at eachotger for 10 seconds but it feels like an eternity. I then with angrly told her im not a dead friend fucker and i wont fuck you this is wrong. 

This chick starts crying and calling me all types of names before telling me to get out.  She looked heartbroken and i felt like shit but i had to stick to my morals . Shes pissed and hasent spoken to me

bzk9g4	2019-06-12 00:15:42		AITA for being upset that my sister is getting a brand new car and I got a hand me down?	"I know, this sounds like such a privileged people problem and I’m sorry if title makes me sound obnoxious. 

So when I was about 20, mom gave me her old ‘99 car and bought herself an SUV. I drove that car for about 6 months, then I got a scholarship and left to study abroad for a year. 

When I came back, I worked for about 6 months and I had a bad schedule at work (from noon to 11pm). I live in a dangerous country and my uncle was disappeared by the gangs during that time, so my mom became paranoid and gave me her SUV to drive around. 

Ever since then, I’ve used the SUV and I drive my sister around from and back to Uni, which is bothersome sometimes but I do it bc I prefer driving her around to her being exposed in public transport. 

Anyways, mom is planning to buy an SUV for my sister, saying that “bc she bought the SUV for me, she’s getting one too”. But I said to her that she didn’t give me a SUV originally, but an old wee car. Which made mom upset and they say I sound like I’m jealous of my sister. 

I’m happy she’s getting a car and she’s gonna be more independent now but AITA because I’m slightly upset that she’s getting an SUV while I drove around in a shitty car for half a year? (And only got my car bc of really extreme circumstances)

bzk9ej	2019-06-12 00:15:36	throwdees	AITA best day of my life - the rental fml	"I fell in love went to get married in a foreign country where my wife is from.  Decided to rent a v8 convertible camaro for the wedding. Valet fucks up the car bumper it dropped down like  quite a bit  and turn signal and a huge scratch down the car. Would be thousands of dollars to fix luckily it was in Jordan 🇯🇴 and my in laws know someone at the body shop. VALET MANAGER AND WEDDING HALL REFUSE TO MAKE IT RIGHT.  Months have passed now but it's still not solved. 

Didn't  have time to deal with it next day. We left  on honeymoon for 6 days. And wedding pics came a few days after we returned which had the evidence that it was the valet. 

Valet manager gave me 50Jd = 70 dollars after I posted the first review and  wanted me to remove it but I still ask about the rest and I'm shrugged off which is like 110jd more, like 150 dollars. 

I guess the fact that I have proof that it was their fault and paid so much for the day to be perfect. I tried to keep it short for reddit  I feel im kind of petty but they're just like getting away with it on multiple occasions.  One guy got his rental car hit by valet in the same week. I don't know if the valet were joy riding or what. 

Am I the asshole for being upset I posted a 1 star on their Facebook Numan halls (event planner Amman) and still carrying on months later. I feel like an asshole for reviewing them and blowing them up on social media. Because if they would have made this right I would have gave them 5 stars as normal.

I just feel like this stuff happens to me and other nice people too often . It just rubbed me the wrong way, police and court would take more than it's worth (fees, time) and they probably knew it or indifferent. 

SHORT: AmITheAsshole for blowing up their social media valet at wedding hall damaged rental car on our wedding night paid only part of the cost to fix less than half and is refusing to make it right when I spent like 10k dollars to have the perfect night.

If you kinda feel like dropping them a one star I will choose an random person for an award when you leave the review put your reddit tag plz. 
Numan halls Amman -(event planner)  they have like 2k positive reviews at the moment I don't know how, I don't feel it's cruel because they could have fixed it multiple times when I went up there to reason with them with evidence. 

Sorry if this post was trash my first time here I'm a lurker ❤️
Hope mods don't remove this or they'll be the assholes today. I'll accept a silver for that

Anyway, currently in Hawaii. 9 hr flight home in 6/3 legs. Before booking the vacation I didn’t know how bad my anxiety would be doing by then. In fact I get home on the weekend and then enter intensive outpatient care for it the next Monday. I was not able to get Xanax or similar because my hometown is in an urban area dealing with the opioid crisis. They basically don’t give painkillers or benzos unless you’re literally dying.



I dealt with sitting next to tall and/or overweight people before and always ended up low key panicking/going into sensory overload from unwanted touch. I don’t start acting like a psycho, but it tends to cause me to fight with my partner and ruins my next few days. This is probably going to be a big problem on the way back because I am also terrified to enter treatment.



WIBTA for arriving early to the gate and explaining my problem to the agent in hopes of being able to sit next to someone similarly petite or in a more out of the way seat? I can pay a bit more, up to $100, but cannot buy two seats due to cost and how close it is to the flight. I can deal with other aspects like noise and lack of space with earplugs and stretching, so that isn’t a problem."	Asshole	0	0

Of course, we were excited to see eachother and went out to get lunch. After that, we hung out a little bit more then napped while watching YouTube videos. In total, we were together for around 5 hours straight.

At this point, I was getting tired. I had a long day of working out (swimming) training to become a lifeguard for my summer job and was eager to just have some alone time to relax. Is that selfish considering she had been gone for 10 days? I told her this and that I think it would be best for her to go home for today and that we could hang out again tomorrow. She was very sad about this, and everytime I asked if something was wrong she claimed it was nothing. I walked her out to her car and she started crying and once again, I asked if she was ok. I calmed her down and she sped off.

A few minutes later, I received a bunch of texts about how she didnt want to go home because family things with her extended family and that she was having a panic attack in some random parking lot. I tried to calm her down and I feel bad. Am I an asshole?

bzk6fv	2019-06-12 00:08:02	raisinsgtfomycookies	AITA for getting angry at my mother for telling my boyfriend to not send me flowers?	"A bit more than what the title is, so my birthday is today and last night I guess my boyfriend was trying to set it up so flowers would be sent to my home as a surprise. He knows that my mum can be weird about my getting packages to the house as I have been screamed at  for my friends sending things to me. She will paw through my packages and criticize gifts from other friends, and on one occasion, she backtracked the tracking number to see where a package really came from to see if I was lying. Bf's logic was  to get an okay from her first to have something sent over so he texted her last night (Is this weird? idk) to ask her if it was okay to have something sent for me. She came barging into my room when I was trying to sleep and demanded that I reply to him on behalf of her. I was already annoyed about being woken up, but on top of that she ruined the surprise that he was trying to set up for me. I didnt want to make a fuss over it so I texted him on her phone, but she barges in a second time demanding that I text him again (as her) to not send flowers for me. At this point I was very much annoyed and getting angry because not only did she ruin this for me but now shes forcing me to tell him to not do this for me. That didnt sit right with me because why the heck is she trying to police what he should and shouldnt be doing because she deems it unnecessary? I dont care about the money, in reality I wouldnt have wanted him to spend the money on me because delivered flowers are stupid expensive. I let her know that what she did was not okay and she got angry with me telling me that she can ask me to write her texts for her because thats ""a mother daughter relationship"" and that her english ""isnt perfect"", but her English is more than understandable so I went to bed annoyed. According to her, it was still a surprise so a couple of hours shouldnt have mattered.

&#x200B;

So that was that and she basically got angry telling me ""not to get her involved"" and to let my boyfriend know not to text her anymore. I did just that early this morning. He didnt ask why, but he's not stupid, I'm sure he picked up that something was up. So I guess she confirmed the delivery with him when she got it and she didnt receive a reply from him and she immediately texted me asking me what I told him. She then starts going off about how bad she must look and that I put her in a shitty situation. She goes off more calling me ungrateful asshole because she was doing me a favour, and telling me to give her back everything shes ever given me because if Im going to be an ungrateful POS then she doesnt need to put any effort into our relationship.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to have to switch highschools? 

My family and I had recently been notified that we needed to vacate our house as the landlord wants to move back in. The rent was relatively cheap and we have been living here for nearly 5 years. During these years, I made many friends and formed many good impressions with my teachers.

We have 20 days left to leave but my single mother could not find another home that is close to here with the same or very close rent cost. We have been trying to find a good place for months and a few places were found, but they were double the rent (still affordable for us but barely cutting it) and are pretty far from our current home.

I also accepted that I may need to take sacrifices and take the bus (or many buses) to get to school everyday. My family is only staying within this city due to me not wanting to change schools and lose the friends that I made in the last 5 years.

My family is blaming me for the doubled cost of rent and saying that I should switch schools and that it is cheaper to move farther away. I only have 1 more year of highschool left and I just want to spend another school year with my friends before post secondary.

bzk5fh	2019-06-12 00:04:59	syntgeix	AITA for not reporting a likely prostitute at my apartment?	"I live in an apartment complex near my college campus mostly populated by students. Since I have a job in the same city as my college I live here year round. Across the hall from me is a woman who moved in at the beginning of last school year but doesn't appear to be a student, she's much older (mid-late 30s), at first I thought she might be a grad student but I've never seen her on campus or with a backpack, books or anything that implies she attends school. I once talked to her in the laundry room, and noticed her clothes were mostly lingerie and skimpy dresses. Not that I cared but eventually I noticed that she has guys over ALL THE TIME, often older than her but also some college age guys. At one point I left my apartment briefly to see her saying goodbye to a middle aged guy, and when I came back a guy I think is a student was hanging out in front of her door and I heard her later let him in. I eventually put it all together and realized what she's likely doing...

I didn't care about it, but mentioned it at a study group for a group project in one of my classes a few months ago, (we were just rambling and also drinking.) One girl there got pretty angry and said I should call the police or at least apartment complex, she lives in the same one (but different building) and noted prostitution violates the lease. I told her I didn't care, I think prostitution should be legal anyway, she lectured me about human trafficking (no idea how that ties into this woman working solo) and how she might try to pick up clients amongst apartment residents (never has to me, and it's not my business anyway) and that it's just not appropriate for her to be doing this in this area. I still don't care.

I'm a senior (just graduated high school so not anymore I guess), and I've known K since 4th grade and C since 7th. We became a trio in late 8th grade and remained that way through most of high school.

Me and C had a bit of a thing in 10th grade. Never went to dating or anything, just mutual minor crushes. But me and K had crushes since 4th grade that kinda died. Note that during high school I'd occasionally switch between spending more time with either C or K. They were both close to me.

Come early-mid senior year. Me and K had, for a few months, been getting closer and closer. Finally we started dating. After that though, C started acting different to K, but not in front of me. I was told frequently by K that she would be neglected and belittled, and she had the emails and texts to prove it. I tried to resolve the situation many times but it slowly got worse.

Apparently C had a huge secret crush on me but never made a move or dropped a hint past our 10th grade shenanigans. Finally C cut us off, saying that WE were the problem. I'll put what she said in the comments (altered because of respect for her privacy) if anyone wants to see.

Basically, now it's just me and K, and C has stopped all interaction with both of us. Even when I congratulated her on graduating the other day, she barely looked at me.

bzk4jc	2019-06-12 00:02:33	evil_lurker	AITA for being mad that a raffle prize I won was taken back because I had already won another.	"So I was at a fundraiser a couple weeks ago.  They had a raffle where you buy tickets and can choose put them in different pots for drawing for different prizes.  The fundraiser was for a good cause, so I didn't mind buying lots of raffle tickets and putting them in the pots of different prizes.

So during the event they started drawing the winning tickets.  I won a mediocre prize  right off.  (Not surprising.  I had bought a lot of tickets).  Later in the evening my ticket got drawn for another, better prize.   The person in charge said ""oh, he already won, let's give someone else a chance."" Then threw my ticket out and drew somebody else's name.  I didn't do, or say anything at the time, but I did quietly get angry.  I mean I had spent more on tickets, so why is it a problem if I won more prizes.  There were no rules in place limiting the number of prizes you could get.  At the very least I wouldn't have minded keeping the second, better prize and giving the first, mediocre prize back.

When I got home I told my wife about this and how I got mad.  She tends to be a better person about these things so I was mainly looking for her to talk me down.   She did make some sense saying that from a fundraising standpoint its probably better to spread the prizes around so people a. Don't feel the system is rigged, or b. Like the event because they won something, and therefore want to come back again in the future to buy more raffle tickets (helping the cause).

Anyway I get all that.  I'm still mad though. So AITA for getting mad that I was denied a second (or better) raffle prize? I feel like I got punished for buying too many tickets and winning early."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzk3ut	2019-06-12 00:00:43		AITA for going off on a girl for calling me stupid and saying i’m not smart enough to get into college.	"So i’m an upcoming senior in high school, and everybody in my class is preparing to submit college applications in a couple months.

The other day we had finished our last exam for the year and all of the kids in my class were talking with the free time we had before the end of the day. I was talking with my friend group in the class, and a couple of other people. I’ve never really been big on going to college, I don’t want to go into debt for the rest of my life because of student loans. I have nothing against people going to college, I think it’s great that they want to further their education to get a better job in the future. 

So once the conversation kinda went my way I stated that I want to learn a trade. I want to either become an electrician or a welder. Then a girl in my class that wasn’t in the conversation to begin with (i’m gonna refer to her as CG or college girl) joined in and said this.

CG: “Haha you probably couldn’t even get into college anyway, that’s why you don’t want to try. (I have a 3.75 GPA, so it’s not amazing, but there are colleges that I would definitely get into.)

It also needs to be said that CGs mother is a lawyer and they her father is a doctor. So her family is definitely not hurting money-wise.

Me: “I probably could but I just don’t want to go to get a degree in something I might not want to do later in life, id rather learn a trade and go into the workforce as soon as possible.”

CG: “Are you sure? or is it just because you’re too lazy? The people who do labor jobs like that are just too dumb to get into college.”

This is what pissed me off because some of the labor jobs are what keep people in society comfortable, and I have a lot of respect for them (Trash men, plumbers, etc).

Me: “Manual labor jobs made the school you’re learning in and the house you go to every night, you’re lucky they’re people that aren’t as stuck up as you.”

(My friend chimed in because he’s taking over his grandfathers business, which is also manual labor)

My Friend: “CG, stop talking, just because MasterBonk doesn’t want to go to college doesn’t mean you’re any better than him.”

CG: (To me) “Maybe if you get your grades up and stop being so fucking stupid you might want to go to a university to learn more.”

Me: “I’m sorry that you’re too much of a bitch to realize that not everybody has daddy’s money to pay for anything they want to do in life. I’ll feel bad for whoever your roommate is, but even worse for the guys who will run a train on you in the locker rooms.”

She walked away after this with tears in her eyes and all of her other friends comforting her shooting me daggers from the other side of the room. Some of my friend think that it’s justified but others think that I went to far with it and should’ve left it alone.

"Basically this guy has been caught in our driveway several times. Every time he’s shirtless and doesn’t say a word as he walks back to his home down the street. He just stands there. For a good minute. Looks at our house. Then turns around and goes back to his. Nobody knows why. He never speaks to anybody. He simply ignores anyone who asks him questions. Oh, and did I mention he does this during the day and in the middle of the night too? 

Another neighbor, the one across the street from us, has cameras. Some face the street and our house. My family still refuses to get cameras of our own and catch this guy in the act of whatever the Hell he’s doing. Personally I want to get footage and show the police. Maybe get this guy to leave us alone. When I asked the neighbor if we could possibly see footage of this dude and maybe send it to the police, they didn’t want to get involved, saying they have no obligation to help. Now I do acknowledge that is their choice, but with this dude being as unpredictable as he is, I tried to persuade them he needs to be caught and stopped. So it seems the neighbors are refusing to help. They’re the only ones with the ability to catch this guy without making it obvious he’s being recorded. They’re the only ones who have the ability to help in any real, possible way. I know they are not obligated to get involved. But to quote a famous person “with great power comes great responsibility”. You have cameras for safety and security, well use them to another’s advantage when some dude is standing in our driveway in the middle of the night multiple times."		1	0

My side...My kids leave stuff around sometimes like cereal bowls, socks near the couch and backpacks by the door. If I ask them to clean up anything, help with anything or do a chore, they do it right away, no complaints, ever. I achieved that with a system from when they were little where if I asked them to do something and if they even non verbally complained, I gave them three more jobs. So this works for me. About once a day, I look around and ask them to come get their things. The house is generally very clean and organized. They also clean their rooms at least once a week and they handle their own laundry when it’s clean and dry. They make their own lunches every day and take the garbage out whenever I ask. If they forgot to bring a dish to the sink etc. I just ask them to come and get it. They help out a lot. 

His side...My boyfriend says I am not doing enough to teach my kids to handle any messes as they go. He feels he is being disrespected if they leave items around the house. If he sees something they left he yells about it to me. He says he is not necessarily yelling at me, but I am usually the only one in the room when he discovers something left behind that does not belong in the common areas. He does all this with a very offended tone and it is stressful for everyone. He has even thrown items at me when he found them, disgusted. He is especially mad that there hasn’t been much improvement over the year that we have lived here. 

I do care about his feelings. I have worked with the kids quite a bit on expectations in the house. However, I am honestly asking AITA, because I do feel like having to immediately check on everything you are doing is something you do when you are a guest, and not when you are at home. I feel very satisfied with their level of responsibility and help. I do get mad at them, but I choose things that are more important for me to focus on like grades, homework, kindness to one another, being a part of the team when I ask. 

My boyfriend is very kind and supportive to them outside this issue. It causes the most conflict between us rather than between him and them. I find myself constantly worried he is going to bring down my whole night because somebody left a shirt near the couch. You would think if I was so worried about it that I would work more with my kids on it, but I just don’t really know how to get them to have all their stuff cleaned up real time. AITA?

bzjyfy	2019-06-11 23:46:17	emeraldevans	AITA for using the same footage for two final projects and then arguing for my grade?	"So I had final projects for my APUSH class and Journalism class. 

For APUSH, I worked with my friend to make a video about Fidel Castro and she posted it on her youtube so the teacher could present it to the class. 

For journalism, our assignment was to create a news broadcast and I worked with the same friend. We decided to work more efficiently and use the same premise. We decided to do a broadcast from the 1960s and used clips from our other project for the on site reporting. We still still created new material by filming ourselves as anchors and conducting interviews. She also posted this on the youtube for our teacher to present. 

However, we received  a 40% on the final project for journalism (dropping me from a 97 to an 88) and when we asked why, we discovered that he looked through her youtube and found our other project. We told him that we thought the grade was unfair because it was still our own work and material- we didn’t plagiarize. Plus, we still had original content for this specific project and it met the criteria. 

He said that’s he specifically told us not to use an assignment from another class but I know that he didn’t and it was just a justification for what he did and said that we were being “petulant” and “unreasonable”.

bzjy1x	2019-06-11 23:45:16		AITA for pushing back on letting my MIL stay at our house for a night?	My FIL is going.out of town one night and she doesn’t want to be alone. She is not disabled. They have a dog and an alarm system. They live in a 4 bedroom home. My husband and I live in a small 2 bed 1 bath home. We go to bed early and have to get up at the crack of dawn. The extra room is used for storage, so no spare room. They don’t live far from us, so I find it unnecessary for us to prepare our house for her, just for one night when not an emergency. I told my husband the larger issue for me is that she will have to be alone if my FIL passes before her. She has asked before, but ended up staying with my brother in law instead (who lives in one of their houses alone...long story).   I have to have downtime for my pure mental health and things I have been dealing with personally. His mother talks non stop and we seriously can’t even just watch tv since she talks the entire time. I seriously would love to move someplace bigger in the future, but feel she would ask to stay with us constantly for no real good reason...so AITA?	No A-holes here	1	0

bzjxiu	2019-06-11 23:43:44	GlitteringCanary1	AITA for making my parents hurt because of their homophobia and... slash-fanfiction, I think?	"Sorry in advance for my bad English, it's not even my second language.

&#x200B;

I live in Russia, where there are lots of homophobic people in general. In my country people usually don't come out of the closet often, and if they do, it's considered a bad thing.

&#x200B;

I am 22 years old gay male from quite ""traditional"" family with ""traditional"" point of view on sexual orientation. Guys should date girls, girls should date guys, yada yada. I think, my mom is more open-minded, because she at least tried to understand what tolerance means, but my step-father... He is 16 years older than my mom, in his late fifties and DESPISE everything that is gay.

&#x200B;

Ever since I understood that I like guys I tried to subtly say it to my mother. A few monthes ago I was brave enough to try to tell it to her upfront, but was brushed off with ""It's just a phase."" I decided to suck it up, because my mother was clearly uncomfortable during this conversation.

&#x200B;

But 4 days ago was a breaking point for me. I am currently writing a diploma for my uni, my theme is ""Fanfiction-communication in Marvel fandom"". If you've read any fanfiction, you know that one of the biggest parts of it is slash-fanfiction (M/M). And, of course, I have (and, in fact, I want) to study it. 4 days ago during our family gathering my mom asked me to tell her about my diploma. And yeah, I mentioned slash, because, come on, 70 % of Marvel-fanfiction is slash! Then my father interrupted me and said something about ""sick who read, sick who write"". I stupidly got really angry, and said ""Are you aware that fan-fiction is not based on author's/reader's sexual orientation? They can write/read it to discuss certain social problem, like self-hate, denying who you are, VERY dangerous issues..."". He answered : ""They shouldn't write, they should act"". Now I think my father just tried to be smart-ass and make a joke (It's kinda famous phrase because it was used in one of our shows in a completely different situation), but then I didn't think and was completely livid. My mom quietly said ""Isn't there anything more normal to write about? (she used the word ""адекватное"", so she could mean ""less complicated?)"" I shouted something at them, I can't remember what exectly, but I remember saying I hate them and storming out. Till yesterday I was pretty proud with myself, I think, but today one of my relatives called and said that because of my outburst my mom was having some health problems. It's all good now with her, but since then they ignored my calls and I am feeling like an asshole. I was trying to hurt my dad, but I hurted mostly innocent mom much more. My friend says that it was a terrible thing to do anyway, whoever I hurt, because having a tantrum because of the slash-fanfiction is silly. But at the moment I felt like it was about something more than just fanfiction.

bzjwrh	2019-06-11 23:41:30	Gas_Menocide	WIBTA if I put up a sign saying kids are no longer allowed to touch my plants?	"Ok, let me set this straight, I live in an apartment complex, it's a small complex, where all the neighbors' kid's come over to one kid's house because he has an inflatable pool. Now that it's summer, I figured that it would be a good time to start growing my Venus fly trap, my potted pink azaleas, and a few water plants that were given to me as a gift when the old owners (who we know cause the old owner is my sister-in-law and brother) and a cilantro plants. 

Over the course of two weeks, I would come home to either a mess on my side of the porch, my plants knocked over, or a mess of chalk or paint (sometimes they play paintball, which is a pain to scrub off my door) now, I've talked to the parents of these kids before, I think they're ok people, we don't talk as much, considering it's me and my mom who lives here, and of course they said they will handle it. 

A week later (last week) I found my entire porch plants knocked over, and kicked over with water bottles on the table and my plant label scribbled over and broken. I talked to the parents again, and they said they will punish them. still nothing. then this morning, I found dirt treaded all over my porch on inspection day, and my collected rain water, tipped over as if it were nothing. 

&#x200B;

So I was wondering, would I be the asshole if I put up a sign to strictly tell the kids not to be on my porch, or should I just talk to the kids directly."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Called back a week later and was told they couldn’t hire me due to a scheduling issue, but they would let me know if anything opens up in the future if I’m interested. Okay, no big deal I said sure let me know and assumed that was probably the end of it.

Recently I get a call saying a different position opened up than I wanted but they might be able to fit around my schedule, it would take them a bit to see if they could but would I be interested. I said sure I’m open to that, what are you thinking.

They say okay we will call you back if our other candidates don’t work out, there is one person we are hoping to hire who is still deciding and another who hasn’t gotten back to us in a week but we will let you know if they don’t get hired.

I felt really offended by this and like I was being used as a backup last resort. I said I’m here talking to you now and I’m willing to start without having to decide, I’m not going to be put on the back burner. Do you want me to work there or not? They typed a paragraph saying they were just trying to help but sorry for wasting my time, so I said ok bye and that was the end of it.

bzjru7	2019-06-11 23:28:28	Sir_Bickles_Queen	AITA - Neighbours have camera covering the entrance and I covered it when i would be in front of it	"I live in an apartment building in a bad area of my city. My neighbours live on the ground floor and had a camera that recorded the entrance to the building. I (18F) smoke in this area. It is allowed and my landlord is fine with it. So no problem there. 

However, the neighbours (One male and one female around 25+) placed a camera in their window that recorded this area. I am fine with it as a safety measure. I do not like them filming me when I am out there for over 10 minutes at a time. I began covering the camera in these instances. Personally I dont want to be recorded as there are people who I do not want knowing where I live.

I would go out place a piece of card over the camera, have a cigarette or a phone call and then remove the card when I went inside. 

A few weeks later I get violent knocking on my flat door. I open it to see what the issue is. Maybe my TV is too loud. Maybe someone had an accident and needed some help. No the woman from the flat proceeds to scream in my face. Saying things like ""why are you covering the camera its shady"" ""we have it for our protection"" ""you must be selling drugs"" that kind of thing. I calmly respond explaining I do not wish to be filmed and when it is covered I am there so if someone tried anything to enter the building I would be a witness. She became exceedingly more aggressive and demanded to know why I dont want to be filmed. I replied that it made me feel (insert noise that represents being creeped out). She then mocked me whilst her boyfriend stood behind her. 

I told her I also smoke out there and would rather not be recorded doing the bad habit. The bf pipes up saying that they have issues with that. When I ask what the issues are he goes quiet. 

When I smoke I dont do it near windows and I clean up the cigarette butts. There should be no issue. 

The woman's mood suddenly flips and is okay with everything and then leaves. 

Personally I think the security reason is a lie as they once let an unknown man into the building who broke into my friends apartment and would not leave. My friend was pregnant at the time and it took hours for us to remove him. But that is a very confusing story for a different time. 

So am I the arsehole for covering my neighbours camera when I was outside. 

TL;DR I covered my neighbours camera when it would film me and they proceeded to confront me aggressively and accuse me of being a drug dealer

Edit- It was illegal for them to have the camera. I informed the landlord of it. I attempted several times to talk to them before I began covering it but they refused to talk."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzjpla	2019-06-11 23:22:42	Derelictjunk	WIBTA if I call for a wellfare (wellness) check on my biological father?	"TLDR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I am adopted. My biological mother passed away from brain cancer in 2011. I found out from my biological father via snail mail. This caused my biological father and I to begin keeping in touch.

&#x200B;

My biological father ended up finding another wonderful woman who unfortunately passed away in January this year also from cancer (different kind). They were together for several years, and she lived with him. He was obviously grief stricken from this loss and I can only imagine the way it must feel to go through that pain twice.

&#x200B;

Since then, communication with my biological father has slowed (understandably). However I haven't heard from him since April and we usually talk at least once a month.I've texted him a few times and haven't gotten any responses. I had my best friend try to call him (I was too scared that the phone would have been disconnected and i would have my answer. I didn't want to hear it myself.) and it went to voicemail. So the phone has not been disconnected.

&#x200B;

Also worth noting, my biological dad LOVES greeting cards, and sends me one for Christmas and my birthday, and has done this for YEARS. My birthday recently happened (end of May), and I did not receive a card.

&#x200B;

I am my biological father's only child and I fear the worst especially after he experienced such a loss earlier this year. He wasn't really in good health, and is in his 70's, and lives alone. He lives in another state, so simply checking in on him myself isn't an option. I have no idea about any of his friends or anyone else I could call to check in on him. I think I really might be the only person he has.

&#x200B;

However, I am really distraught as to whether or not calling the cops to do a wellness check would be overstepping any boundaries. But I also feel that this might be the only way for me to find out whether or not he is still alive.

&#x200B;

I have done some googling to see if I could find any obituaries or news stories that may lend some info into whether or not he's alive, but I was unable to find any such information. So if he has passed there's no obituary.

&#x200B;

TLDR: My biological father lives in a different state, isn't in very good health, lives alone, is in his 70's, and experienced a loss this year. Him and I are not very close, but keep in touch at least once a month. I haven't heard from him since April.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I call the police for a wellfare check?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: finally got a text from him saying ""I'm okay kiddo""! And now I'm asking him how he'd like me to handle situations like this going forward if it happens again, and if/how I'd be notified if something did end up happening to him. Glad he's okay so we can have a discussion about this. Adoption is a weird, messy, painful thing. In my case I am better off due to being adopted, but I still had to lose a family. Thankful he's okay so we can have an open conversation."	No A-holes here	0	0
bzjp9h	2019-06-11 23:21:49	testacct995	AITA for wanting my friend to reassure she doesn't think I'm an antifeminist fuckboy?	"My fiend and I have been close for a while and she's very much a strong feminist ally. I get it, it's an important issue, and I consider myself an ally too.

However, what differs between us is the intensity in our beliefs. Small but insidious stuff like me disagreeing how some feminist groups advertise (I think saying ""the future is female"" is more divisive than helpful). We've had some arguments over the last year where she's said that ""she thought I was different"", implied I was a fuckboy, and generally put me into a box where it was clear she feels I'm just some other dude off the street who doesn't respect women.


Honestly I've been trying really hard to understand her points of view and the general female experience. I get that there's some things I just won't feel strongly about because I don't fully comprehend the feelings behind them and likely never will, and have been trying to be more empathetic towards that.

We got into a fight where she was going off about horny men who were fantasy readers and how much of the genre is written or portrayed with very two-dimensional female characters. I made some comments that I felt were obviously sarcastic about how there needed to be more cleavage in someone's armor because that's how girls work in fantasy worlds. She seemed to take me at face value and it made me feel pretty shitty about myself because it felt like she had no issue in her head thinking I was just another horny fantasy guy. She says she interpreted my comment as just misunderstanding how female anatomy works and that I'm being rude by assuming ""the worst response"" from her instead of what she actually thought.


In my perspective it was a very fair assumption to make because she's seemed to label me negatively before and has made no effort to say that she doesn't think that of me now. I just want to feel cared about and respected but I keep thinking she thinks the worst of me because of what she's said in past fights.

Maybe 1 for the lovely beginning we had..	"I got in the car and didn't really hear the music. Everything was good, totally nice lady having a full on conversation with me. We turned onto a busy road and that's when the talking ended and she kinda turned up her radio which was playing a song chanting ""Our God is amazing"" Fifty times later after the guy sang ""Our God is amazing"" again I just got too annoyed and asked her to change it or turn it off.

She said ""No, it's my car."" In a snarky tone. I decided after about 2 songs later it was a good time to mention I was going to give her 0 stars for semi-forcing me to listen to Christian music. and she said ""Really? You're going to rate me based off of my music taste?"". The rest of the FIFTEEN minute ride was silent (Well, aside from the fucking GOD IS GOOD SHOVE GOD DOWN YOUR THROAT OR GO TO HELL music playing in the background).

I'm at home now and on the rating screen. Would I be an asshole to give her a bad rating, because of this reason?

While I was working there I met a girl from Australia who I got along extremely well with. Over the course of our time in Hawaii we became intimate and shared a lot of good times together.  As summer came to an end we both parted ways agreeing long distance wasn’t in the cards but if we ever came close we would give it a shot. We kept in touch weekly for a few months until things fizzled out a bit. 

Flash forward six months and I’m itching to travel. Australia had always been on my list so I figured I would go ahead a give her a call. She said it would be awesome if I came down, so I booked my flight a few weeks later. We talked a lot leading up to my trip and I was beginning to feel our relationship reconnect. 

When I arrived everything was great the first few days, and I began testing the waters to see if she was still interested in me sexually. After struggling to gauge her feelings, I straight up asked her if she was interesting in being physical. She beat around the bush a bit, but finally admitted she would rather just stay friends. I was hurt and to be honest in ruined quite a bit of my trip, but I understood and I made that clear to her. The next day, her mother revealed to me that she was planning a trip to Las Vegas a state over from where I live. When I asked her about it she confirmed but that was it.  

Later that night we were having drinks and I asked her why she didn’t ask if I wanted to come see her in Vegas. She explained that “I just wouldn’t get along with her friend, and I wouldn’t have fun.” This hurt the most. I felt like our friendship was over then. I tried to ignore what had happened and attempted to enjoy my last few days down under. The trip came to an end and after a half-hearted goodbye at the airport I flew back to the states. (I want to add here I never expected a long distance relationship or anything of the sorts just wanted to pick up where we left off and have a good time)

After returning I was still a bit broken up and seeing her posting photos of her partying with friends (refused to have more than a couple drinks with me on the trip) and I had to unfollow/unfriend her. I feel like there was nothing left. 

AITA for cutting her off?

bzjkmj	2019-06-11 23:09:49	ariesv123	AITA for not wanting to have my dog console a crying little girl?	"TLDR: I didn’t want a 5 year old girl to push my dog’s patience and cause her to get bit. In response, my brother got angry with me.

I (17) have a toy poodle mix named Fluffy (4). She’s 13 pounds with her current amount of fluff. People always tend to comment that she looks like a teddy bear and she is indeed a very sweet girl. 

There’s a Little girl (LG). no older than 5 in my neighborhood that always rushes to me whenever I take Fluffy on a walk. She’s well intentioned but is always very pushy with Fluffy. Trying to grab her leash, pick her up no matter what she’s doing, and touching her paws, tummy, ears, etc. She usually complains if Fluffy has to go inside and doesn’t take no for an answer often. She’s not spoiled, just a kid that doesn’t know how to control her emotions yet. I always make sure to explain to her how to be safe around dogs because one day she may encounter one that may put her in danger. Of course she’s only 5 and I understand that it’s always my responsibility that my dog doesn’t hurt anyone.

Flash to just now and my younger (15) brother comes inside from playing outside, saying that he needs Fluffy. LG is outside crying and says that she needs Fluffy to console her. I advise my brother against this because she will most likely milk the situation and my brother just can’t say no. 

Fluffy is extremely patient with young kids but she doesn’t like them. Her reaction is usually to go hide somewhere but she does understand when to behave. Of course this is dangerous because kids tend to corner her and this would obviously cause any dog to freak out. My fear is that LG will push Fluffy too much and cause her to bite or in the least scare the girl by barking in her face.

I say “she’s my dog and if anything happens the responsibility is on me no matter what”.
In the end my brother gets his way because my mom allows it. He comes back inside with Fluffy and says “since she’s your dog i’m not doing anything for her”. Fluffy didn’t bite her (I don’t think) but it’s still something that could’ve happened.

I totally understand his reasoning but I don’t think it’s fair that he gets like that every time I try to put a boundary down about Fluffy. I do understand she is indeed my responsibility always.

bzji1m	2019-06-11 23:03:09	Egggggggggggggggggge	WIBTA for skipping my friends graduation/ going away party	"&#x200B;

For reference I'm a 17 year old dude in the Netherlands. 

So my ex best friend, who I'm still friends with, has invited me to a massive graduation/ going away party that she's going to throw in a couple of weeks. This party will most likely be the last time I'll ever see her, as she'll be moving to America for a year after the summer holiday and once she's back she'll move to a different city. 

&#x200B;

We've been friends for a pretty long time, since the start of high school, around 5 years ago. We drifted apart over the course of the last year and a half, but that's mainly because I started hanging out with other people and kind of ditched her. From what I heard she was pretty upset by this and she has tried to reach out to me more over the course of the last few months which is why I want to go to her party to properly say goodbye.

&#x200B;

The thing is, I'm not doing too great at the moment. Without going into too much detail I'm struggling with some mental health issues and my social life has been almost non-existent since January. I've basically completely stopped talking to anybody and social interactions are very mentally taxing for me at the moment. 

&#x200B;

And here-in lies my problem. I'm not sure if it's a good idea for me to go to the party. 

For reference, the last house party I went to was back in December. The party was going pretty well until I suddenly started to really freak out half way through. I'm not completely sure what to classify it as, but I'd say that anxiety attack would be the most accurate. I was almost completely unable to speak, my thoughts started spiraling out of control and I almost had a mental break down, so I had to leave very early. 

&#x200B;

So on the one hand I want to be there for her and to be able to say goodbye, but on the other hand I'm not sure if it would be a good idea for me to go, as best case scenario I get really drunk and have an okay time, or worst case scenario I freak out and ruin her party (which has happened before). I haven't decided whether I will go or not yet and I want Reddit's opinion before I make a final decision.

&#x200B;

She does know that I'm struggling with some stuff, but she doesn't know exactly how bad it is. I'm in no way implying that she is any sort of asshole in this situation, I just want to know if it would make me a dickhead for skipping her party, as she specifically wants me to be there and I most likely won't ever see her again.

&#x200B;

Side note: She is one of 2 of my friends that will graduate this year, as most of my friends were either held back last year (including me), are being held back this year or are staying at my school and going from HAVO to VWO (basically doing another 2 years of high school at a higher level), which is why this is such a big deal to me."

bzjhga	2019-06-11 23:01:44	carklorft	WIBTA if i told my friend that talking about her boyfriend is annoying?	"Okay so I know how this sounds but I have a few points to make.

My friend is going to a university abroad and we rarely talk nowadays. We used to be very very close and she still sometimes calls me when she is distressed and I do the same.

Other than that we didn't really keep in touch that much, mainly because of uni work. But when we did get in touch, or when she came home for the holidays I guess I would have liked to catch up with eachother. She always talks about her bf, like full on gushing about him. It's cute sometimes but other times I try to tell her a story or ask for advice, I sometimes even call her when I am upset and out of nowhere she goes ""My boyfriend is soo great"".

It's weird, and mildly annoying. Like I understand that you like him but the fact that you can't concentrate on the current conversation is ridiculous. The other day I was talking about one of our common friends and telling her how concerned I am for her because it looks like she got herself into some shady business and in the middle of it I hear ""Brian is looking so cute rn"". I mean???

Don't get me wrong it's not THAT annoying and I don't want to make a whole discussion out of this but WIBTA if asked her stop doing this the next time it happens? Obviously I don't want to be an ass or upset her or something."	No A-holes here	0	0
bzjguk	2019-06-11 23:00:18	Kaptin_Krunch666	AITA for saying no to mostly all the things my dad wants me to do for this summer?	Ok so every summer my dad makes me go to camps, join lots of clubs, volunteer at places and just so many things. And every time I have been forced to do so with him saying that it will be a good experience and when I say no every time he forces me to do it anyway. And I have just had it. This is my summer to relax and by relax is whatever relaxing is to me. And I feel like next year or in the following year i’m going to need to get a actual paying job over the summer. So I have just had it I really do feel like I have earned the right to spend my summer how I want to spend it. And what I want to do is yes stay home and watch tv and play video games. I do plan on going to the beach also and doing some things and I still plan on visiting the family that I see every summer. But the summer camps and volunteering crap I don’t want to do. I have actually gotten to the age where I’m not even allowed to be a camper at summer camp no I’m forced to be a L.I.T (leader in training) or also means the same thing a C.I.T (counselor in training). So basically watching snot noises brats all day with no pay while sweating my ass off. And clubs just what the fuck is the point? I don’t want that I just want to do what I want to do. I truly want to relax for my summer because when school starts I’m so stressed out I feel like I deserve my summer for once. But my dad is calling me ungrateful and everything and demanding that I will do what he tells me to do. But no I’m standing my ground. But really AITA?	Not enough info	0	0

After spending several months with him I started to just hate being in his presence. He’s prideful af, mildly misogynistic (idk how to phrase it), always think his way is right, and thinks low of others (indirectly). He hasn’t done anything to me for me to completely cut him off but I can barely stand being around him. It’s exhausting, coupled with the fact that he always wants to do stuff with me (I’m now realizing that in the time he’s lived here he hasn’t really made friends so he hangs with me 🧐).

Anyway, I’ve stopped replying to his texts, I never initiate plans with him and when he come visits he wants to make plans and talk but I give one word response or seem uninterested in what he has to say. Idk how long it’ll take him to realize this. 


I’ve talked to him about what he does that bothers me, hasn’t made any changes. We’re cousins so I guess I’ll just put up with him? Ideally he’d be an “ok” acquaintance but spending too much time with him is a big NO."		1	0
bzjgc1	2019-06-11 22:59:05	jtharp7	AITA for cutting in line at the post office	"A few years ago, I had an issue with my local postman.  They would never attempt to deliver packages, but would leave those ""sorry we missed you"" notices in my mailbox (I assume the employee was too lazy to walk up the flight of stairs to my door).  One time a notice was left and it said I could pick up my package at an office across town.  This is a huge inconvenience, as the line at the post office is often more than 1+ hour on the weekends, which is the only time  they are open that I am not working.

So I go to the post office that weekend, and I wait in the line for 90 minutes or so.  They are unable to find the package however, and tell me that it is at a DIFFERENT post office across town.  At this point I am pretty ticked off as I was home during the time frame the initial delivery was missed, and because I just spent so much time waiting in line as well as driving across town to the other post office.

I went to the ""correct"" post office and there was another line there.  I decided to go straight up to the window instead of waiting, and informed them that their error had caused me to wait for 90 minutes at the other post office, and that I wanted them to fetch the package immediately.   Obviously a few people in line were frustrated and told me that I was cutting the line.  I told them ""I know, and i'm sorry, but I've already waited in line for 90 minutes at the WRONG post office because of their error, and it isn't fair that I should have to wait twice.""

The way I rationalized it was that I had already served my time waiting, and that if I had gone to the correct post office right away, they would have been delayed the same amount of time as by my cutting of the line.  At the end of the day, everyone has waited through one line, and since I should have already been at the correct post office earlier, they would have been delayed the same amount of time.   On some cosmic level, everything was as it should be.  Maybe that doesn't hold water - you tell me.  AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

We had a common interest of video games and anime. She was also a virgin too.  We dated for about six months and had no arguments whatsoever. She insisted we should have unprotected sex then and there, but also while confessing her just started recently period. I was awed at the fact. She wanted to have unprotected sex while on her period. I declined and told her that I don't want my dick in period blood. She suggested to use a condom if it makes you feel that uncomfortable. I declined again and told her we'll do it after her period.

bzjfus	2019-06-11 22:57:54	Throwaway5813557	AITA for not agreeing to a refrigerator in our livingroom?	"So my boyfriend and I have just moved into a new place together. We've lived together for 6 years already in a pretty trashy apartment while we were both studying. The old apartment was always messy and cramped and pretty much every room was used for storage apart from the bedroom where we'd study/play games etc. Our new place is a little smaller but so much nicer and it came fully furnished and decorated really nicely. It's our first ""proper"" place together and the first place I've ever felt was a proper home and I've enjoyed, finally, having people over and not having to apologise for the mess. Recently my boyfriend has said he wants to buy a refrigerator to use when he brews (he's been brewing his own beers for the last couple of years as a hobby). I pointed out we didn't really have any room for another refrigerator but he's decided he wants to put it in the livingroom. I've been totally against this as it would look so out of place and stupid just sitting in the livingroom. He insists it would be a big help for him when he brews and it's something he's always wanted for brewing. We talked about it and I conceded to getting a smaller refrigerator as long as it was black or stainless steel so that it would fit in a little better with the rest of the decor.  He came back recently and said he can't find one like that in his price range and the only ones he can get are white and secondhand. I've pretty much said I don't want that in our livingroom and emphasised how this apartment wasn't gonna turn into a dumping ground like the last one. He says I'm being totally unreasonable and that it's both our place so I can't tell him ""no"". We've never had any arguments before about this kind of stuff and we've been together 10 years now (lived together previously for 6) and I've said I wouldn't just say ""no"" unless I felt really strongly about it but it seems he's just going to buy any old refrigerator anyway and get it delivered whether I like it or not.

I live in an apartment that has a shared front porch with another apartment. Since my neighbours had a child they have started to sometimes throwing closed used diapers onto the porch in front of the trash cans where they leave them until they can be bothered to actually throw them into the trash. I find this disgusting and am not okay with it so I resolved to moving the diapers to their front door when I see them laying on our porch in hopes that they realise I'm not okay with this and stop. I rarely ever see these people and I hate confrontation so I really don't want to directly ask them to stop.

bzjf2d	2019-06-11 22:55:48	NextPick	WIBTA if I got angry at a roommate for letting a pet go outside?	"I'm a university student living off-campus in an apartment complex. It's a 4-person apartment but we only had 3 people living here, until last week. My interactions with the new roommate (I'll call her Ann from here on out) have been very minimal since it seems like if I'm home, she's not, and vice versa, but our 2-3 interactions so far have been very pleasant. 

&#x200B;

I have a pet hamster that I keep in my room. She's pretty old so when I take a roadtrip back home once a month, I usually leave her in my apartment to minimize stress on her and such (I leave her lots of water and 2 days' worth of food, so no worries). The 2 roommates that have been living here know about her, but I just never got the chance to tell Ann that she exists. 

&#x200B;

Well I got back to my apartment after being with my parents for the weekend, only to find my hamster cage empty. I searched all around the house with no luck. I finally decided to ask one of my roommates for Ann's number and texted her to ask if she's seen her around. Instead of texting me back, she calls me, and I already assumed at this point that something bad has happened. It turns out that the hamster got free from her cage (NEVER happened during the 2 years that I've had her) and somehow made her way to Ann's side of the apartment. Ann thought she was a wild mouse, caught her, and dumped her outside. Up until this point, I couldn't blame her too much since I just never had the chance to tell her about my hamster. What got my blood boiling was when she said, ""You know, in retrospect, I see that she's a pet because she kept scratching at the door and wanting to come inside."" I just started sobbing right then and there because I could just picture my hamster doing that and I felt so terrible. But then Ann says, ""Were you attached to her?"" 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry but I've never met such a dense person in my entire life. She is my pet, so yes, I am attached to her, which explains me sobbing hysterically. I didn't want to get angry at her because, despite how dense she seems to be, it just seems like she genuinely did not know that she is a hamster and not a mouse, and it's also my bad for not letting her know I have a pet.

And putting it as bluntly as possible- it's just not a good time for me, despite being something I would really like to do. 

I have LOTS of trips away coming up (its my 30th soon), they want me to cancel tattoos I've been on waiting lists for, I'm studying and working hard (about 45-65 hours a week).

"I've been trying to experiment with cooking with less meat recently as my SO and I have some ethical issues with eating meat all the time, though we still do eat meat sometimes. I recently made a curry that I thought was vegan. My vegan sister (she is also a vegan for ethics rather than any medical reason) happened to visit just after I'd made the curry, and there was enough for her to have some too, so I didn't think anything about giving her a bowl.

Later, I realised that the curry paste I had used contained a few grams of shrimp, and mentioned this to my SO, feeling guilty, but said that I wouldn't tell her that the curry hadn't been entirely vegan.

He thinks this is an asshole move as my sister deserves to know what she is eating, I should apologise to her because I made her go against her own principles and values, and should promise to her to always check my ingredients better for her, so she'll know she can't fully trust the food I make and can do her own checks on everything.

I think it would be a bad idea to tell her even if it's just to apologise. It will just make her feel guilty for no reason because I can't unmake the curry and she can't uneat it, and I should just keep quiet about it and check my ingredients better in the future.

"I know, this sounds wildly like I would be an asshole and I can't believe I'm even considering doing this. But I don't know what to think, considering the circumstances. This might get a little fucked up and kinda dark. 

I am 18 years old, female. I've been dating someone for the past 2 years online, seriously, and this week I finally flew out to meet him. He's a lot older than I am, as I've always had a bit of a thing for older guys, but I found out he may have lied about his age and is even older than I thought. An online friend did a ton of research on him(I did NOT ask him to do this), and found all of his information like where he lived, where he works ect. And sent it all to me.

The thing is, today will make five days I have been here in his city. He knew before hand I was coming to his city, and tomorrow will be my last official day before I fly home Thursday. Since I have been here, we have not once met. I spent pretty much all my money on this trip thinking he would make time for me, but he's been too busy with work every day. He has told me over and over that he hopes we can meet, and that he's not sure if we can, ect. And has shown no signs of not wanting to. I have a feeling he is just making excuses. But I am absolutely in love with him, and I want nothing more than to just see him in person. I've put so much effort and time into this relationship trying to make it work, and I am getting so stressed out from the possibility of him just playing games with me and wasting my time. I don't know what's going on anymore, and I'm sick of not knowing what's going on. 

Part of me feels like I should just walk away, and the other part of me wants to show up at his house and ask him what the hell is going on. And now I have that option, even though it seems like a horrible idea that could go wrong in very many, different ways.

Attempts to talking about these concerns of mine over the phone, he's busy. I text him my concerns, left on read most of the time and sometimes he'll respond hours later to them. But in my eyes he does seem genuinely interested in me. But trust me I have tried talking about these things with him. 

I'm going to try one last time to talk to him over the phone about it later today, and give him a chance.

Walking away is safer, I know, but I honestly can't deal with not knowing what has been happening. I'd rather deal with the possible heartbreak than make excuses for him, but not knowing 100% is putting me in a spot where I keep giving him second chances, if that makes any sense. Showing up randomly at his house though, that seems like it might be crossing a certain line. 

So before I do anything like that, Reddit, would I be the asshole?

Edit: I dumped him. I appreciate the support, but please fuck off and leave me alone now.

Second edit: As an extremely bitter 18 year old who is in a lot of pain, if you assholes can call me stupid for being with this dude, I can tell you to fuck off if I so please. I genuinely appreciate all of the supportive comments, but the rest of you can shove prickly cactuses up your asses for all I care.

Update #3: I'm so happy right now, after I texted him telling him it was over, he texted me back asking why and I told him because I thought he was leading me on. We're going to be meeting in an hour now, in a public place, surrounded by people. I've told my mom where and when, and a friend as well. I'm the happiest person in the world right now.

Update 4: Are people not reading my post? We already met. He's harmless. He was never hiding anything. He wasn't avoiding me. He was real and was the person I've gotten to know. He's working two jobs, that's why he had so much trouble finding time to meet me.

bzja4q	2019-06-11 22:43:05		AITA for telling my friend to break up with her boyfriend?	"To be perfectly honest, I think she's an idiot with some degree of Stockholm syndrone. Shes going down a dangerous, but very predictable path. Some backstory to this, because i think it's relevant. 
 
She and her sister were abused by her dad growing up, he would physically beat them whenever he got angry. This only stopped like a year ago, and according to her, her dad is chill and doesnt do that anymore. He's still prone to anger, but he hasnt laid his hands on them for a while now. As for her mom, she divorced her dad and left them behind a while ago. They're still in touch, and as far as I know she's mostly alright, but she's kind of a bitch. In addition to this, she also dated some abusive asshole. When my friend and her sister temporarily moved in with them, he would threaten things like ""killing her mother in front of her"". Long story short, he got arrested. My friend and her sister went to live with dad again, and they've lived together since. 
 
But now, Dad's moving away for work, and my friend is moving out. She has been really broken up about being away from her formerly abusive dad as if they had a good relationship. So where does the boyfriend come into play? Well, i mentioned everything previously because i genuinely believe that these events have affected her preference in guys. Her current boyfriend is an asshole. He yells at her, threatens her, and i don't think it's too far off to assume that he either has or will hurt her. Despite constantly going through these stupid fights, she continues to insist that this guy is the one. Now I'm no psychologist, but i honestly think that she is chasing after abusive guys because of her experience with her dad, or a behavioral trait that she inherited from her mom (i mean, she long term dated 2 abusive assholes. Its not far fetched to believe that theres some genetic predisposition to falling in love with scumbags). 
 
In addition to this, she has dated scumbags in the past. I have no idea how many relationships there were, or how long they lasted. Ive only heard bits and pieces from her stories and rants about how ""all guys are trash"". However, I do know one guy she dated. A guy my age who I know personally. Hes a super chill, nice, handsome dude. He treated her right for the whole month that they were together, and then she broke up with him because she just ""didn't feel that spark"". 
 
I'm ranting now, so I'll wrap this up here. I brought all this up to her and she was seriously offended that 1, I'm dissing her boyfriend, and 2, I'm making assumptions. She won't talk to me anymore. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bzj9y1	2019-06-11 22:42:32	OwnUnderstanding6	WIBTA If I report my Mother-in-Law to DHS regarding her behavior towards my Sister-in-Law with Down Syndrome?	"For the past couple of years, my MIL has been a hinderance to multiple people in our family as she has been manipulative and extremely narcissistic in her intentions. She has a daughter with Down Syndrome who is really sweet and has always been great to have around. Of course my SIL does a lot of things that are stressful but that is to be expected given her age and such but can also be very loving towards those around her.

My MIL has refused to have her in school because she is afraid of what other people might do to her. Because of this, my SIL has not been in any form of schooling for the last four years. She has told the state that she has been but that is not the case. Given this horrible decision, my SIL has not had the chance to understand how to read, speak, or other basic things (cleaning, laundry, etc.). She has spent the last couple of years playing video games, going to bars with her, going to movies, and whatever my MIL finds to pass the time. This is the main thing that has been really bothering me as I don't think my SIL will transition well once she becomes old enough to live on her own.

Whenever I or my partner try to bring this up, my MIL will get really angry because she is the mother and we shouldn't be criticizing her actions regarding this situation according to her. I have mentioned the possibility of reporting her to DHS as I am genuinely worried about the safety and health of my SIL. Most of the family on my partner's side have mentioned that this would be extremely devastating and that I would basically be the most evil and sinful person in the world to even suggest such a thing. I disagree with their remarks but obviously am still thinking through this scenario.

bzj9pr	2019-06-11 22:42:00		AITA for being frustrated and annoyed with my mom because of how she's handling the passing of my grandmother?	"About mom: My mom cared for her father during his end of life, probably for 5 years?. She was not there when he did pass. My grandmother (Dad's side) has been battling cancer for \~4-5 years. I know it deeply affects her emotionally. She sees all the bad stuff. My mom sacrificed everything and has taken care of ailing family for a decade or more.

About grandma: They tried all kinds of experimental drugs but nothing worked. About a year ago my grandmother decided she was done trying to treat the cancer. At this point I began to accept the loss. \~6 weeks ago she said she was ready to go see God.

Hospice care started about a month ago, and I left work early to be there for hospice to come do the ""setup"" at my parents house. A week into hospice mom called so I left work early to say goodbye, again. I've been up to see my Grandma as often as I can 1-2 times during the week after work and often times on the weekend. They live 1.5 hour away. About 2 weeks ago my mother started calling me every 2-3 days that today was the day. She was going to die and I needed to get up there. Whenever I get there I have a few laughs with my grandma. We've already talked about her passing, she accepts it, and I accept it. After the 4th visit in 2 weeks today is the day. She's not waking up, agonal breathing (5-6 breaths/min).

Mom: You should come up here.

Me: Why?

Mom: Your dad and I are her whole life. People should be here for her. Your cousin, sister, aunt, dad and I are here. (Other son) will be here Saturday - no sooner.

Me: It's shitty that something is more important than his mother, but I can't help that (other son) isn't there.

Mom: I think you'll regret not being here.

Me: I don't want to be there for the last breath.

Mom: She'd want you to be here.

Me: We've been over this and Grandma knew I didn't want to be there for the end.

Mom: Dad needs you.

Me: I've tried putting my arm around Dad - he accepts a small hug then pushes me away.

Mom: Everyone was here when Grandpa passed.

Me: I wasn't.

Mom: Here's your dad.

I'm getting frustrated at this point, but I keep my tone level because it's already emotional up there.

Dad: Hello.

Me: Hey, so what's the plan?

Dad: It doesn't look good.

Me: Do you want me to come up there?

Dad: Well, you know how it is. She might be gone by the time I go upstairs or she might live until Friday.

Me: How responsive is she?

Dad: She can still hear you, but not sure how long that will last.

Me: Do you want me there?

Dad: That's up to you.

Me: Okay, love you.

Dad: Love you too.

Mom takes the phone.

Mom: You should come for Last Rites. It will be beautiful.

Me: It sounds like she could go any minute.

Mom: She can still hear you.

Me: I've already said goodbye.

I'm 14 (m), my parents divorced when I was around 6 or 7, so I've grown up only ever knowing this kind of lifestyle. The custody agreement was originally everyother weekend for my dad, luckily my mom graciously gave him every other week. I have a little sister who also follows this agreement. I have a half sister of whom my dad had 8 years before married my mother. She stayed permanently going between my father's and her mothers house. That's all for background.

I recently  went to the beach with my mom, sister, and grandparents last year. When we were there my mom realized I was texting my dad alot more than I ever really text her. By alot more I mean I texted him good morning and goodnight every day of the week we were there. She pulled me aside and asked why. I explained I missed him and was afraid he was lonely. (My half sister recently moved out to be closer to her job. My mother took my aside, told me it wasn't healthy that I should worry for my father and that I should stop. She then asked if I wanted to know why they divorced.    
I of course said yes. She essentially went on a tangent slandering my father calling him verbally abusive, a deadbeat, and an overall burden on the household. 

There are a few reasons I dont believe this. These first ones are about my dad. He's essentially a teddy bear. He's a big burly man who almost never raises his voice. He doesn't insult us except for jokingly. He's always extremely tender. I doubt he's a deadbeat due to the fact: when he couldn't find a job in the area while completely his online college courses at age 40, he would drive 4 hours every morning  to DC just for a job that would support us while also allowing us to remain near our moms house even during his week. 

Reasons relating to my mom, if anything she's verbally abusive. She yealls and screams profanities and insults at me for every minor error. Example: I left some chopped fruit out accidentally and got yelled at for 40 minutes and was called retarded. She's manipulative, shell play the martyr all the time and mutter just loud enough for others to hear about how she's not loved or appreciated.

Tldr: Am I the asshole for not believing that my mom was verbally abused by my dad when all signs say it was the opposite?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bzj8rm	2019-06-11 22:39:36	LordR3ptar	WIBTA if I keep posting a meme to my discord server?	"I found [this terrible meme](https://imgur.com/gallery/LtngLBe) on May 28th, and have posted it at least once a day to my friend’s discord server. Sometimes I’d post it even more (about ten times), but usually I wouldn’t exceed more than three times per day. The sole reason for posting it so many times is just to be annoying. 

Now, two of my friends have raised their voices about it. One of them has started to send me gory videos (thank god the thumbnails are small and I don’t have to click the link) for every time that I post it. However, this is not the friend I’m concerned about. 

Last night, at around 2:30, I was especially tired and I kept uploading the meme. My other friend sent me a message earlier today saying, “Hey I need to ask you to stop with the cereal meme it sent me into a bloodcurdling rage and (insert mutual friend) had to hold me back before I said anything either of us would regret so please I’m asking you man to man for my sanity and your safety stop with the cereal meme.”

But him just saying that makes me want to post it even more now because in my eyes, it’s just a stupid picture. Nobody else has said anything, though I do know that it’s annoying them. WIBTA if I didn’t stop?"	Asshole	0	0

Summer in Malta gets HOT & of course I like wearing shorts, however sizing for me is a bit weird because of how im built (short but thicker) & regardless of the style of shorts (unless theyre literally half way down my thigh), they always end up slightly riding up & exposing just under my bum [like this](https://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/732160/164171399/stock-photo-women-posing-from-behind-in-a-white-jeans-shorts-and-jean-jacket-164171399.jpg). you can see you dont actually see my bum but its pretty close. for me, i dont mind it because i'm comfortable but my husband gets mad at me often for it. he says i shouldnt wear them because he doesnt want ""my ass on display"" & he says i should wear longer shorts or a dress or something. i tend to get sweaty, so wearing anything longer causes chafe & get super uncomfortable, rashy & can even bleed- plus imo they make me look stumpy & im already self conscious of my bigger thighs.

bzj76e	2019-06-11 22:35:34		AITA for being bothered that employees at a fast food place refused to acknowledge I was there.	"A little back story, my small town has 2 locations of a popular coffee chain, one in the middle of town and one on the highway less than 5 minutes away, owned by the same people (sister stores as we called them). Up until a few years ago, I spent 3 years working at the highway location, 2 of which I was a supervisor. So I understand how this business works, I understand the stress employees are under, I understand how shitty customers can be, I understand how shitty the job itself is most of the time. Because of this and my other retail experience, I try to be very kind and understanding to other people working in customer service. I’m not one to make complaints over petty things, or get unnecessarily angry at staff.

My current work place is about 2 blocks away from the location in the middle of town. I decided to stop and get a coffee before my shift. I arrive 10 minutes before my shift starts, knowing that even if it’s busy, since I’m only getting a basic coffee and paying exact change, I’ll be at work quickly once I reach the drive thru window. I place my order and arrive at the window about 5 minutes later (again, I understand that it’s busy so I don’t mind the wait).

When I get to the window, there are 4 staff members there, including a supervisor and the manager (whom I knew since she was still managing here back when I worked for the sister store). The drive thru window was open and I see my drink sitting right in front of it, my change is in my hand ready to go, 5 minutes leaves me with plenty of time to get to work. 5 minutes later, all 4 employees are still there and have all looked out the window and saw me there, but  none have acknowledged me. I look at the clock and see my shift has technically started, I decide I can’t wait any longer because i need to get to work. 

So I call out to and say “Excuse me, can you please cancel my order? I need to get to work”, and while I am a bit irritated at this point I’m still polite when I say this. The supervisor is the one who answers me, she says “your drink is right here, do you want to pay for it?” (as if there would be any other reason I was sitting at the drive thru window for the last 5 minutes). I hand her the change, take my drink and head to work.

Now, I wouldn’t be bothered if someone at least acknowledged me being there and said “we’ll be with you in a moment” or something. But the fact that my drink was ready, I was completely ignored, and that *I* was the one who had to say something in order to be served, when both a manager and a supervisor were right there, sort of rubbed me the wrong way. 

I try to be understanding, but that kind of service would have never been acceptable when I worked for the company. I don’t want to be the bitch who calls the store to complain (I probably won’t do that since I don’t like confrontation). But am I an asshole for being irritated by this?

They are both a little over a year old now. I never let them go outside. They are obviously fixed so that isn't a concern. I keep them inside because they could be injured or killed by wild animals or other cats. Or catch some disease/parasite. Or get hit by a car. Or poisoned by some psycho. Or stolen. Ect.

Anyway, some of my friends think I'm being cruel by  not letting them go explore because that's what they are supposed to do, apparently. I disagree for the reasons already stated. Plus, as far as I know they have never been outside and they don't seem to have any desire to. I mean they do stare out the window a lot, but don't all cats do that? It isn't as if they constantly sit by the door begging me to let them out.

EDIT: also because I don't want them kill birds and stuff, forgot to mention that.

bzj471	2019-06-11 22:28:08	Walusqueegee	AITA for blocking my uncle on my phone and every form of social media after he called my mom a drunk?	"Let me preface this by saying my mom is *not* a drunk. Like every middle aged mom she has 1-2 glasses of wine every night. With that being said, I’m on mobile yadda yadda. Let’s get into it. 

So i am almost 15, and my mom and i have been living with my grandma (Mom’s Mom) for the past two years or so because we had to sell our house for financial reasons. 

Recently, my 2 uncles (Moms Brothers) came to visit for a few days for Mother’s Day, so they could spend time with my grandma. I see them about once a year, so we had a relatively good relationship. One of the days they were here they took me to a vintage guitar shop i was wanting to go to, so I could check out some old basses, and everything went fine. 

A few days ago my mom just broke down crying and saying that my one of my uncles, let’s call him R, told her that she was a drunk and needed help. Obviously, she isn’t. 

So i asked her what she was talking about, and she said that after we got back from the guitar shop, she went to thank my uncles for taking me to the guitar shop, as she had not been feeling well that day. (She has crohn’s disease, Lupus and AS) and basically R lectured her about how he found 3 wine bottles under the sink, and knew just by that, that she drinks excessively and that’s why she’s in bed for most of the day some days. (It totally isn’t the fact that her spine is fusing together or anything and it’s excruciatingly painful for her)

He basically just told her that she needs to go to rehab, and since one of her doctors is also an addiction specialist, she would be able to get treatment for her “addiction”. Now she thought that it was weird that he knew that one of her doctors also treats people with addictions (that’s not what she sees him for — he’s a pain specialist & she’s treated with him for 10 years), considering she never mentioned it— the only other person that knew that fact is her best friend of over 35 years, because she works in the medical field. We’ll call her S. 

Later that week she texted S and asked her if R had contacted her recently, and S started apologizing and saying that she was sorry she didn’t tell my mom sooner. They had a long talk and made up. 

After i heard about all this, I texted my uncle, (R) and told him that he was way overstepping his boundaries, and asked him to apologize.  His response was something along the lines of “i’m just so worried about you and your mom, and i want what’s best for her”, and refused to apologize for any of it. I then told him that I couldn’t talk to him until he apologized, and he said he never would.  My mom didn’t want me to block him because she didn’t want this to affect my relationship with him, but I couldn’t talk to him after what he said.

I use the headphones until today where leave my room to grab a pop. I come back and my phone is missing from where I left it. Weird...
I asked my brother and he acted stupid all ""Oh, i dont knooowww, did you look in your butt?"" I searched my room and found it hidden... odd. I started watching my show on Netflix again when he comes in and grabs the headphones from my head. ""Dude! what the crap!"" I yelled and he quickly curled around the headphones on my bed, I went to grab them and he punched my hand away. I told him to give me the headphones and leave me the F alone but he just held on tighter. After some wrestling I grabbed the headphones but he grabbed the cord and yanked... It came right apart... I literally threw him out of my room. I was UNHINGED not just because he broke the headphones but because I also dont exactly have money to freely throw at new $60-$70 headphones. I calmed down, locked my door and layed on my bed, after some research I found a cheap pair of headphones on Amazon for like $20 I also have Prime and a $20 giftcard. Bottom line is, if I bought those WIBTA if I made him stay right the fuck away from them and never let him use them?

About a week ago, we realise there's a random yiayia in our front yard picking them and putting them in a bag. To get to the tree, you have to walk down our drive way and through our entryway, and we could all see her from our living room (we were standing around and there was no way she didnt see us.) At no stage did she ask us, she didnt even knock on our door.

My partner went outside and asked what she was doing. First she told us that she lived next door (she doesn't. We know our neighbors pretty well) and then she told us she knows the owner (she doesn't, he would have told us if she was coming over. She couldn't tell us his name or anything. ) My boyfriend just told her to ask next time because he works nights and he didnt want her to ""spook him."" I'm of the opinion he should have told her they're our olives as we pay to live there. Our housemate is pretty bummed that he cant use the olives and I'm pretty mad my partner didn't even ask for the olives back, and he's pretty insistant that I'm overreacting and shes ""just a cute yiayia, you know how they are.

I don't even kiss in front of my kid unless it's a quick peck to say goodbye or something. The couple times after that she seemed pretty normal, just quiet if anything. But after awhile it started annoying me. She wouldn't speak unless it was to my BIL, and she only ever whispered to him... Still, didn't really bother me, I thought she was just shy... But a couple months passes, she still didn't speak to us, still all over BIL. The only times she did say something, I wish she wouldn't have. 
What really made me start disliking her was when we were on a double date. The waitress took our order without writing it down, and then went to the table right behind us to take theirs. I don't think she knew she was right behind them and she says something along the lines of, ""watch her get all our s*** wrong."" And complained how she didn't write it down. Well the waitress heard her, and gave me a dirty look. It really annoys me when people treat waiters badly, so I spoke up and said something like, ""well maybe don't complain unless it is wrong"" WELL, she didn't like that... lol. Most awkward double date ever. She still came over a couple times after that, didn't even smile, or try to engage in conversation. She just sat glued to my BILs hip whispering. So I finally told my SO, I don't want her in our house. Since then his brother hasn't even came over. Which sucks bc they were REALLY close. They act like we hate them now and it's really weird at family get togethers... 
I'm just wondering if this is my fault/if I should just let her come over anyway for my SO.

Tl;dr: I don't like my BIL's gf because I feel like she is always all over him, even in front of my kid, and doesn't speak unless it's something negative. So I said I don't want her over at our house, and now his brother won't come over either."	Not enough info	0	0
bzj0gr	2019-06-11 22:18:53	Onearmssss	WIBTA If I Revoke a Baby Shower Gift?	"Going to try and keep this as short as possible. 

A friend of mine invited me to her baby shower but I ended up moving out of state so RSVP'D no and bookmarked her registry for later. We are mostly work friends that spilled over into getting a drink together (pre-pregnancy lol) or talking about baby stuff since were in the same boat for awhile. 

Fast forward to the beginning of this month and I figure it is time to send her a gift. I had a lot of fun picking out things for her, and since I had just had my own I made sure to think back to all the things that were life savers for me. Windis, Marpac, Tubby Todd, bathtub etc...plus a lot of stuff from her registry and a couple boxes of diapers.

Delivery day comes, I get a notification it was left at a drop off location. Crap. I messaged her and gave her a heads up that she needed to bring her boyfriend to help her retrieve the gifts since she doesn't have a car and they would be big boxes.

5 days go by and I get another notification that the packages are still awaiting pickup. I shoot her a quick text just being like ""Hey incase you don't have the the address for the pickup location here it is...""

3 more days go by (today) I get a notification that it's still awaiting pickup and that she has until the 13th to pick them up otherwise they will return to sender.  I don't really want to reach out yet again about the gifts, at this point I'm feeling a little a beggar ""Please go get my gifts!?!"" which is ridiculous. 

This is someone who posts on Facebook every hour and gives updates about everything from what she ate to how much she slept too btw. She has been with her boyfriend multiple times and out and about a lot for the last 11 days. So I'm having a hard time thinking this is a case of her being too busy or not able to get there. 

I asked my husband what to do, remind her again or just let them get returned and send her a giftcard or just say screw it nothing at all. Husband says what she did it extremely rude and to not send her anything anymore. I am inclined to agree but I feel like a huge asshole considering it, so will I be the asshole if I don't resend the gift?

EDIT

INFO: All the messages I sent to her were via Facebook Messenger and she received and responded to me. Both times telling me she was going to go get the gifts that day. 

In my second message I not only sent her the address but the hours of the pickup location as well.

EDIT 2

Thanks for your input, I did end up sending her one last message about the deadline to get her gift so we will see if she actually goes to get them otherwise I won't be shipping them back to her. My husband thanks you all as well since apparently it's all I've been bitching about for the last few days and now he feels validated in telling me my job is done. Lol"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzizwr	2019-06-11 22:17:25	UsernameTaken1244	AITA for not wanting my mom to drive my car	"My mom got into a car wreck back in early/middle May. I loaned my car to her to drive, I would go to her place every morning and she would take me to work then pick me up. In the meantime she was able to use my car for about 8 hours from 10a-6p. Even after I was off work she would make me wait at her place because she would have more things to do, despite me having my own errands too. I usually ended up staying at her place til 8pm or so because she was using my car. This went on for about a few weeks (even on weekends.) 

Flash forward a week later and I got a new job at the hospital about 3 blocks from where she lives, my mom also got a new car at this point too. But it's more convenient for me to park and leave my car at her place and walk the 3 blocks to work because I'm there every morning to help my dad with his daily cares. 

I walk to work when I'm done rather than drive 30 sec to work and park in the employee lot which is about a 8 minute walk to the hospital itself then walk back after my shift and drive 30 sec back to take care of my dad again. Every time I come back home I know she drives my car because of the way she positions the seat and seatbelt.

A few days ago he got really fucking angry out of nowhere and then all of a sudden he decided to literally cut the internet cords in half. I was beyond mad and so told him that to his face. He starts telling me that he’s been mad that i’ve been playing video games all day and not talking to anyone in the house even though I consistently have conversations with my mother he just so happens to not be there. Then he decides to tell me that I should let his son play my video games and that I should take a little break.

Obviously the video games don’t affect me in any of my life especially my social skills so i don’t see why he’s so bothered by it. After the conversation was over I told him to stop acting like my father because he’s not and he never will be and he was fighting with my mom earlier so she didn’t care about what I said and he also says my mom should even be defending me."		1	0

bzixzd	2019-06-11 22:12:28	Strymerican	AITA for lounging around doing nothing in my PJs all day after a busy work week?	"Mobile formatting, sorry. 

My husband and I both work long hours but also get a lot of days off most months. It isn't unusual for either of us to have a 'lazy' day after a long stint of work days, where we just lounge around, order delivery, and do as little as possible. Now, my husband is just finishing up an especially long job that took him on the road a lot over the past two months. He does this every year and I'm always very happy to accommodate his lazy days when he's finally done with the job. But this time it has coincided with my own (much smaller) work stint, where I'm coming off of 45 intense hours of work over the last four days. That pales in comparison to husband's gig but, remove his situation from mine, and I will tell you I am very tired. So I took a lazy day today. I haven't done shit and I'm very pleased about that. 

Husband did have to run into work for a few hours today and upon coming home has been rather judgmental towards me about me not even being dressed. In a vacuum, I'll acknowledge that it's supremely lazy/gross of me. But this is not that unusual for either of us to do every once in a while. We don't have kids, there's no pressing housework other than a few dishes which, whatever, I'll get to them (also not unusual for both of us), so I don't see what the problem is. We do have dogs and I could've taken them out for a walk today but our yard is fenced so I just let them run out their energy there instead. He did exactly the same thing with them yesterday when he was home and tired, but did suggest last night that I get them out today, to which I responded with a solid maybe. I defended my busy work schedule to him but he just brought up his own much more extreme case as though it negates my own desire to relax. For what it's worth I offered to make dinner once he got home, or buy delivery, or whatever he felt like, but he grumbled it off without an answer. I will probably probe him a little bit more later to see what the problem is but before I do I just wanted to see if you fine people think I'm being an asshole here?

TLDR: I was very lazy today after a long work week. My husband, who behaves the same way after busy jobs, is judging me for it because he has been working harder."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Hello, I am an American uni student (freshman year yeet) I attend a uni very close to my parents house since it is a very cheap option but it entails me to live here. I am a intended computer science major and all the math classes have stressed me out and my houselife worsens it. My parents argue every damn day, sometimes over the pettiest shit and it can last days with all of us emotionally distressed. I also have autistic brother who can get very violent and this inevitably causes more conflict. I cannot imagine myself living under these circumstances for the next four years. As such, I am planning on transferring to another uni my sophomore year. It will suck losing all the friends I made and the tuition is more expensive but I just want a peace of mind.

When this idea was presented to my mom, she responded in a very malicious manner, implying I am selfish and do not care about the family. I responded by stating that the situation is beyond my control. My decision is final, I'm definitely transfering regardless. But in retrospect, I feel guilty. I guess in a way, I'm leaving my parents to deal with the situation on their own and I won't be there to help. Or am I going insane?"		1	0

Go grocery shopping. I even make his breakfast the night beforewhen I know he has to drive farther away for work that day.

I bust my butt to make his life easier. Because he does work more than I do, usually. Except...like I said, these past two weeks.

He plays online games, which he asked me if I was okay with. I said sure. Just help me bring the groceries in. He did, but promptly threw them on the floor to rush back to the game, leaving me to put away everything. 

I then asked him to help me cut apart the chicken because it was still frozen. It was ""wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute."" For a good 15 minutes. I started to get angry, as I was tired, just got done my shift (which my job is caretaking, so I already take care of people 24/7) and wanted to get dinner out of the way.

He helped for one minute to get the chicken apart. Said he couldnt. And ran back to the game.

Well I got really angry. I exploded on him when he was waiting for another round to start. He then started saying I was being totally unreasonable and I should just wait until he has time. I'm sitting here fuming.

I kept forgetting for about a week (despite a few reminders) to send him pictures and then bring him the dress, and when we finally sorted it out I admitted that I’m really uncomfortable with whoever he was gonna be taking pictures of wearing my clothes. He was frustrated that I had waited this long to admit that, and I decided that to deny him the dress when the project is due so soon would be an asshole move, so I gave it to him.  Later he said I could make it up to him by modelling for the pictures  because it was easier to schedule with me than his other friend. I let him borrow a shit ton of my stuff for props, and was bored and hot and tired for hours while he took photos. He had an unusual amount of help from his parents for a homework assignment- they were making a lot of decisions. Also keep in mind that I’m very self conscious about having pictures taken of me, and he knows this. He said he had a few more pictures to take and asked if I was free on Tuesday. I have plans to see my dad (who I rarely get to see) then, but I asked when we would be done and he said 4:30. I clarified “you’ll have me home by 4:30?” because that seemed rather early. He said “yeah” and I said “ok good cause I have plans.” Fast forward to today he’s asking that I have a whole new outfit and do my hair and makeup and everything again, and I do my best. I text him to remind him that I have plans so we’d betted hurry up. He claims that he said he’d be home and then come pick me up at 4:30, not have me home by then, so clearly there has been some misunderstanding. Unfortunately I am busy all of tomorrow and told him so and why I can’t cancel my plans when he asked if we could postpone to then. He started getting really passive-aggressive over text, saying that I never told him and “well have fun with your dad i guess cuz there’s nothing else we can do.” I feel like he wasn’t organized at all (as I said, even during the photoshoot his parents were doing a lot of the creative work). I feel kinda angry that he’s mad at me when I’m just trying to do him a favour (that is very boring and uncomfortable for me) to make up for taking so long to give him a dress to use. Am I the asshole? Should I have made it more clear that I have important plans? Oh, and he posted on snapchat that he’s really upset about something today but I don’t know what (I did ask).

But when I’m *not* working, I often stare back.

Recently I was telling a story to my mom where I was sitting at a restaurant for lunch and an older man was craning his neck to stare over a short wall at me.   
  
I ignored it for a bit, then I stared back. He just kept staring. Looking me in the eyes while I ate. This went on for like 5+ minutes.   
  
So I stood up and stared until he finally looked away. Then every time he looked back over I stood up again.

bzis6p	2019-06-11 21:58:22		AITA for kicking my brothers out of my groomsmen party	"Backstory: THIS IS LONG. STRAP YOURSELVES IN 

My brothers are both older than me, by 6 years(fakename Dick) and 5 years(fakename butt). I’m 27 years old and excited to marry my longtime girlfriend and best friend for many years— so I’m ecstatic.

Brother Butt, has long needed financial help from me. Up until last year there were a ton of times where he needed financial help from me. Those are the times I would hear from him the most. He’d call, exchange pleasantries(ask about my son) and then begging to ask for help. Wouldn’t hear from him on anything else. He never calls me to hangout(I have texted him and call him to hangout) but he usually brings his wife or opts to just hang out with her at home. So we don’t spend much time together outside of going to my mothers and seeing eachother.

Brother Dick, and I have spent more time together as he’d often come over to my house to hang out, 420blaze it, or just shoot the shit. He also has long needed me for favors. Whether it be using my network to try and further his career, or flat out giving him money for things. After getting engaged to my fiancé, I invited him out to go downtown and have some drinks. After many hours, and many drinks, we went to leave.

At this point we’re walking and both had been drinking. Brother Dick turns to my fiancé and tells her, he’s good to drive. I immediately in my stupor Fire back with “fuck no you aren’t, let’s Uber. But If anyone is driving it’s gonna be me.” I had no intentions of actually driving as an Uber home is 5 mins away. He gets annoyed and tells my girl one more time to give them the keys. At this point I’m annoyed, said, “just gimme the fucking keys.” To my fiancé. (I was an asshole for that and apologized the next day) and at this moment with my back to him, he shoves me down to the ground and before he can get on top of me, my buddies break it up.

After that, we went our separate ways(me to my Uber with fiancé and buddies and idk where he went) but he spent the next 30 minutes drunkenly texting me about how he’s gonna come to my house to whoop my ass and I’m never allowed to talk to her like that. He also mentioned how he’s the big brother and is gonna make sure I can’t walk.

SINCE THEN:

It’s been 3 months and we haven’t spoken. He tells my mom that I was exhibiting abusive behavior and it’s his job to rectify it. He hasn’t come to me to apologize. He’s bailing on my engagement party. I even had my fiancé give him a birthday card from us at a family dinner with money and signed from me- takes the cash and says nothing.

So with all of this being said- AITA for wanting him to no longer have the honor of standing up there with me? My other brother I feel like should be off too because the guy takes 0 time to ever talk to me unless he needs something(and he’s done some shitty things to me and fam involving money) and if one is out, might as well have none to also be fair.

"I work in a job driving a truck and lifting furniture. I'm 1 of 2 employees able to drive the trucks. This will be important later..a few months ago a nodule appeared on my tonsil. This was frightening to say the least as I had recently quit smoking and it would cause me pain when I laid on my side making sleeping painful. I went to a doctor and he said it needed to come out immediately. We had it scheduled
and everything was ok. Then I got sick with flu and couldn't go in for surgery. Fast forward a month and the procedure is rescheduled, but for whatever reason the secretary ""forgot to schedule me"" and then I had to wait ANOTHER month for this.
Every time my procedure got rescheduled my employer would complain how it was fucking with his schedule because he needed me to drive the truck (even though there was someone else who could the whole time. He just didn't want to have them drive.)
Fast forward to this last week, the doctor finally calls me and says someone cancelled and they can fit
me in for a procedure. But it would be in 3 days or I'd have to wait for an entire 2 months. I took it immediately. Telling my employer that I had to do this. And he loses it with the temper. Sending me walls of text asking if I can wait another month for a procedure which I failed to mention earlier, to you the reader (I had mentioned this to the employer) would be checking me for cancer. 
So yesterday I get my procedure done. It turns out my situation was worse then I realized. What was supposed to be a little nodule ended up being my entire left tonsil.
The doctor ends up telling me I can't do any heavy lifting for atleast a week. I tell this to my employer, and he loses it, a wall of text saying how I've ""fucked him over"" and he didn't ""care about my doctors note"" that I'm costing him money and it is unacceptable..very angry texts implying that ""I don't give a damn about your surgery I need you to come to work"". Bare in mind I'm not the only one who can do the job I am needed for. There are several other guys to do the physical work. And atleast one other person properly licensed to drive one of the company vehicles.

I am at a loss. On one level, I have another job that can give me just enough $ to pay my rent and buy food Until I find another job. And I don't  want to return to an employer who at any moment could ""verbally abuse"" me for not prioritizing his business over my health.

He had broached the subject of marriage a few times, asking what I liked in terms of rings and I responded (even sending him the exact ring that he could buy). I dont recall the site now, but it was weird (like me),had sapphires in it and cost about $800.

When he proposed, while nice, the ring wasn't my style and wouldnt have been something I would have picked out for myself. However I said yes, didn't comment at that moment but chose to bring it up a few months later when we were talking about wedding bands.  I asked him what made him choose that ring specifically, and he said it was just better than what I selected (it valued over $3000).  

I fixated on the word ""better"", and got upset because why should something I like not be good enough when he could have just spent less money and gotten something I liked ""better"". He got pissed and said I could pick my own band, which I did and loved. He meanwhile called me materialistic.

My roommate's brother died a few days after mother's day this year. When I woke up on mother's day, I noticed that my roommate wasn't home and I was parked in. I didn't want to bother him because I knew he was spending the last few moments his family had with his brother together. I told my mom what was happening and she was not happy, but I went home the next weekend to make up for it.

&#x200B;

I was just at home last weekend and she called me today and said:

&#x200B;

Mom: ""Father's Day is next week, are you going to come home?""

&#x200B;

Me: ""Yeah, of course""

&#x200B;

Mom: ""Oh really? That's funny because you missed mother's day...""

&#x200B;

This really aggravated me. I raised my voice a little bit and said ""You know why I missed mother's day! That was completely out of my control, quit trying to make me feel guilty for it!""

&#x200B;

She started to cry immediately and said ""Oh well you're always complaining that you come home too often so how would I know""

&#x200B;

I said ""Yeah, I come home way more than I should be expected to but that doesn't mean I'd intentionally skip mother's or father's day, and if something happens and I can't make it you shouldn't be making me feel guilty a month later!""

&#x200B;

She said, whilst crying: ""You know what, I'm just gonna go"" and hung up.

&#x200B;

I feel terrible. I haven't made my mother cry since we got into arguments when I lived at home so it's been a few years. Should I feel about this? AITA?"		1	0

bzip80	2019-06-11 21:51:12		AITA for making my son sleep on the couch and letting my daughter have the bed/bedroom?	"The short of it is that my husband and I have booked a vacation home rental on the beach so that we could get away for a few weeks with our kids (13F/15M). 

We thought the house had three bedrooms. Turns out there was a misunderstanding and there are only two. One master bedroom with a king bed and another small bedroom with a full bed.  Plus the living room, which has a good-sized couch. 

My husband and I are taking the master, as planned. So we have to figure out what to do about the kids. I felt that my daughter should be in the bedroom. This isn’t because I have favorites or anything like that. I just think it’s nice for a young teen girl to have a door to close if at all possible. (Without getting into too many details, it’s a transitory and sort of delicate time for her - women will likely get my meaning). 

My husband agrees with me but my son is, understandably, annoyed. Maybe my perspective is a little old-fashioned, but I expected that he would have offered his sister the room anyhow (which is what my own brothers would have done and have done in similar circumstances). Didn’t happen that way, so here we are. 

I would really like to hear from a broader group whether I (and my husband, I suppose) are wrong for making this decision. All perspectives welcome, obviously. Thanks."		1	0

bzinz7	2019-06-11 21:48:13	superwarioboss	AITA for being mad that my friends made a trip without me?	"So back in February I (17M) got a call from my best mate (18M). He said that him and three other of my close friends were planning on going on a trip to Spain (we live in Sweden) together with our friend group consisting of 8 people in total. One of those friends have an apartment down there so the cost wouldn't be that large, just around 3000 SEK (about $300). The problem is that since we all go to school none of us have a job, any form of own income or any kind of savings to take money from, I knew that it would come down to which families could pay up for the trip. I questioned this and thought that it was quite crazy to put every family on the line to pay $300 out of nowhere for their 17/18 year old kid, even though my family can put up that kind of money I know that one person in our group (my gf at the time) don't have a family that can. But he insisted and said that this wouldn't depend on our families. He said that if I save **all** (note all, I would have about $20 to live on for 3 months) of my money that I get from going to school I could just about have enough to come along and I simply said that that isn't realistic for me because even though I live at home I have to buy normal day to day stuff that students have to. After that he simply told me to blame myself for not being economically smart enough.

&#x200B;

Well all 6 of them went on the trip, apart from the person that couldn't afford, and now I'm stuck in Sweden all by myself feeling pretty mad and left over. I know that at least 3 of them got their trips payed by their parents even though they said that it wouldn't depend on them. Of course it's fun to travel with your friends when you're 17/18 but I feel like it's not very nice to do so when none of us have own jobs or any chance of paying for our selfs. I also feel like it's kind of a dick move to leave two out of eight persons out on a thing like this. But maybe I'm just salty that they're having a good time. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

Since SD appeared, it feels like everything has to be catered to him. Silly little things, yet they still grind on me. ""Don't use the bread because SD needs it tomorrow"", even though I need sandwiches for work when I start at 8am and he doesn't start work until 2pm. Or ""hurry up and get the dishes done before SD comes home"" even though he does not clean up after himself, will leave the bread board and the knife and butter on the side for someone else to move. Like I said, little things but still super annoying.

SD has adopted my 6y/o brother because he was only 1y/o when SD moved in and has since had a kid with my mum (now 4M) but has made little effort over the past 5 years to get to know me and Jordan (the 19y/o LB). I get that we're not his kids but he has moved into our home and made it his home too, so thought he would at least make a little effort like we have with him.

Anyway, the point I'm getting to is that everything is catered for SD and half of the time he comes home from work in the foulest of moods. Picking fights with my mum, telling the kids of for stupid things (i.e. laughing too loud when watching tv). I have backchatted to him a couple of times now - one time he was picking a fight with my mum about how much money is being spent, so I told him that if she needs to watch what she's spending then maybe he should also cut down on how much beer he buys (drinks at least 3 beers every night after work). Tonight he came home and as soon as he walked through the door (no exaggeration) was moaning about the hallway light being on, with the typical northern ""it's like blackpool illuminations in here"" and proceeded to turn the light off and then start muttering to himself as he heads towards the kitchen. I told him that the hallway light was on because I was under the stairs trying to find some shoes because it was raining and I was going out for a smoke. Ended with ""but nevermind, eh?!"" and slammed the door on my way out. 

Part of me thinks I am being pathetic with all of the little things but my S/O thinks my backchatting is justified. Mum has never complained to me about it as a lot of the time I stick up for her, but I feel like I might be causing more trouble between her and SD.

bzilri	2019-06-11 21:42:47	eallybigass	AITA For Being Done With My Manipulative and Crazy Ex?	"Throwaway account.

So, I recently got out of a manipulative relationship. Her name (for this post) will be Anna.

When we started dating, Anna was the nicest person ever. Always happy, loving, and trying to make me and those around her happy. One day, it was like a switch was flipped. She went from constant happiness to barely happy. She would get angry at me for trying to be a nice person (asking her how her day was, trying to listen when things got rough. Just trying to be a nice boyfriend to her).

A few weeks went by and her outfits started to change. She started dressing darker and covering her face with hair and makeup. I wouldn't have thought anything of it if she hadn't mentioned she was starting to feel insecure. I tried comforting her, but she began abruptly and angrily pushing me away, saying I would never understand her. She said I was too boring and never took anything seriously. She just didn't let me in. There were times that she would be less angry and we could have a normal conversation, but then she'd become angry and say I took things too seriously. Things weren't adding up.

A few months ago, we broke up after not even a year. It was just too much. There was constant name calling from her, she always tried to make me feel like the culprit when things went wrong in her life at her house, she always took her anger out on me, and when I confronted her, even a little bit, she played the victim and tried to make me feel bad, and would have full blown bawling meltdowns in my car about her life. She would then immediately apologize for her behavior and say she's just tired. This was almost a weekly thing.

We ended on alright terms. I wasn't really angry with her because it's hard for me to hold a grudge. I told her if things got rough/there were no options for her I'd be willing to listen/help. Time passes, and she starts texting me again about how she hasn't wanted to live. I followed necessary steps, including reporting her behaviors to college counselors, her parents, etc. This was after speaking with her and discovering she has had a history of this. She needed help. She spoke with people and seemed to have sorted it out.

Today, Anna texts me. She's still living with her mom, and her mom apparently doesn't support her career aspirations and limits her from leaving the house even though she's an adult. Anna started texting me about how she's gonna die, how her parents' parenting choices have prevented her from knowing what's right and what's wrong, and that she's going to end up really hurt because she doesn't know better. Again, I started empathizing and tried to help in any way I could, but her words were, and I quote, ""oh fuck off we're done talking here. thanks for being just as supportive and caring as my mother lmao."" I didn't reply. I am tired of her. But part of it doesn't feel right because of her potential actions. Reddit, am I the asshole?

Update: as if on cue, she texted and apologized. Manipulating again."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzildt	2019-06-11 21:41:49	Frysken	AITA For shutting out my cats during the day?	"TL;DR at the bottom.

The way my room is set up is that it's connected to the bathroom. Like, I have two doors -- one to exit my room to go in the living room, and the other one leads into the bathroom.

My two cats' litter box, little tree-hut thing, and food dishes are in the bathroom, and we usually keep them inside the bathroom at night because they jump up on counters and break stuff (even though we're really trying to train them to not to). However, at night when I go to sleep I often let them into my room for the night (sometimes I don't because I leave my other door open... It's so hot.)

Well, I usually call my friends and we play games together. We're loud and explicit, so I keep my doors closed when I play, which is most of the day. I don't like to have my cats in my room if my doors are closed for too long 'cause I get paranoid that they're gonna.... I dunno, shit on my carpet or something. I'm not really making sense but I've never owned cats before, so.

Anyway, usually when I go out to get snacks or go to the bathroom or something, sometimes the cats will follow me to my door and look up at me. I'm assuming that when they do this, they want to go in. I fell really bad when I close my door on them.

Note: I live with my grandparents, who don't really approve of me and my sister swearing, or at least, swearing around them. That's why I'm self conscious about my loudness and vulgarity. And I can't really just ""not swear"" because me being the dumb teenager I am, I probably wouldn't remember that my door's open, so I'd probably accidentally slip up.

**TL;DR** I shut my cats out of my room when I play video games because I'm loud and I swear uncontrollably, and sometimes I think they really want to go in and I feel bad shutting them out.

If IATA, which I'm assuming I am, how can I do better?

I've been thinking of getting over my stupid anxiety and just letting my cats chill in my room with my doors closed. I don't even know why I'm anxious about it -- they've never gone to the bathroom anywhere except their litter box, and all they really do in my room is scratch up my stuff and sleep.

Edit: Before I sound like a cruel human being, let me disclose this: We do let them roam free around the house during the day. We let them out depending on when at least someone's awake to watch them, and we close up shop depending on when the last person awake goes to sleep."	Asshole	0	0

The people are Jelly the girl I’m telling off 

2nd is Mango who is my best friend, and she’s the reason why this whole argument started. 

And I am Jerkchickenfoot.

So after the end of 9th period my best friend Mango was upset because my math teacher, which is also her math teacher (dif periods.) got her upset because she was talking when she shouldn’t have been, but other people were talking so math teacher called her out, instead. She was ranting and she got into an argument with Jelly. Jelly said, “I’m trying to help you pass, you are spoiled and you need to be behaved.” In a condescending way. A. Jelly isn’t even good at math, so I wouldn’t even be going to her in the first place. B. Mango is spoiled at home, but her parents still check her when she’s out of line, so I don’t know what Jelly is even trying to get at. 

Mango is arguing with Jelly, and I said Mango what’s wrong? and Jelly gives me this whole face and she says, “You’re not in this so back up.” 

I said, “First of all, I know, that’s why I asked Mango, not you.. she’s the one who’s being bothered by the situation, when it’s not even that big of a deal, and you are talking to her like she’s a fucking child. Second of all watch your tone. I don’t know who you think you are talking to me like that. Because I can make this personal real quick.” 

She making faces like, “What can you make personal about me? You don’t even know me. I don’t know why you are being so rude?” 
 
I said, “because you were rude to me first of all. And you are also mad petty, and think you are above everybody else. How you give  my other friend an invitation and then told her to give it back, because you felt bad about it, and posted it on your story? Like what is wrong with you? You are also mad fake, you are mean to people who stick up for your ass on the bus, when you cry when your ‘friends’ be going in on your ass. Like fuck out of here, I tried to be nice to you, but you just like being a fucking bitch. and it’s not even cute, it’s petty and that’s why people don’t fuck with you anymore, or talk shit behind your back. And let’s not forget how my friend was talking to someone, and they told you about it, and you all of a sudden liked them? Man fuck out of here. You just petty for no reason, and it’s not even cute.” 

She ended up getting upset. And I really don’t care, Mango told me I didn’t have to do all that and she’s really upset, but I think she gotta understand that she can’t act like that and not everyone is gonna let it slide? I need opinions on this. AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	1	0

This may Be long so i apologize.

So there was a divorce i moved out to play for an out of town hockey team i made. When the season was over i moved back and this new girl was in the house living there. My Dad and i Were super close so i saw him a lot happier than i usually see him so Great im happy even though he cheated with her. Slowly things started to changed after she SWORE she won't try to be my mother and influence me in a bad way (im 18 at the time) after time she started tossing out my moms stuff out and claims ""new chapter new life"". I am an active kid im ALWAYS out of the house. im only there to shit sleep and eat and the yard work cause he has 3 jobs since the divorce killed him in the bank account.

Anyways she kept getting more and more Upset when my dad and i would watch Sports, or go to events together. SOME sort of argument always had to come up when we were together. Eventually he never came to my games anymore even if they were home games and he never had to travel and also had free tickets so he didn't have to pay a cent!

One day. i hear slamming and yelling and screaming i tell her to calm it down im trying to sleep. She screams ""did you eat my Cupcake"" My Response was ""Holy shit really? thats what this is about Grow up. ill buy you one later sorry"" And tensions were getting a little more than usual until i got dressed up went downstairs and had the option thrown in my dads face ""Its me or your son i can't take this anymore"" So my dad kicked me out. At the time i moved in with my Girlfriend for 4 years. im 23 now and the girlfriend and i decide to call it quits so by this time my dad and i patched it up and says you can move back home but here is the rent fee yata yata yata. Not a problem im 23 and have a great job. I paid (after a few months) almost double my rent to help him with the mortgage my food and bills. 2/3 was rent now

So im living in this basement suite and i have for some reason daily check ups and some more spits and spats accure how my dog cannot be in the yard and the same time as her dog? whatever the fuck that means. I need to park a couple blocks away cause my truck is too noisy and im not allowed people over. I understand shes a landlord but oof come on man. So my smart ass decides to do the following. Throw a superbowl event (Pops gave me the green light). I had 4 people over and we were quiet for the most part except the bad calls or touchdown screams. you know the usual. I got outside at halftime to check my BBQ and i hear her screaming Cause i put a Lock on my door for privacy reasons and im going against her well wishes. I need to be evicted. So i decided to just move out into my own place. Give them the rest of their bills on there own and i told my dad ""as long as shes in your life i wont me""

bzij49	2019-06-11 21:36:17	aitamommm	AITA for trying to talk my daughter out of her relationship?	"My daughter (let’s call her Sarah) is 19. She lives with me, her father has been absent since she was little. She’s my only daughter and this can cause me to be overprotective, but I’m working on that.

Since she got with her boyfriend (Jake) about six months ago, I’ve been very uneasy. Jake seems like a good kid, but as Sarah started telling me more about him I became more and more concerned. He’s been in foster care ever since his father went to prison, when Jake was 14 if I remember correctly. He doesn’t go to college, but has a job as a mechanic. I’ve tried to talk to Jake and get to know him better myself but he’s very aloof when I talk to him. Because of this all I know about him is from what Sarah tells me.

For a while I didn’t voice my concerns. She was very excited and seemed happier, so I tried to be happy with her too.

However, a few weeks ago Sarah came home from hanging out with Jake and some of his friends. She looked upset so after a little coaxing she told me that one of Jake’s friends had mentioned that he and Jake had been to court due to theft when they were younger. She said he said it as a joke and was very vague about it so she wasn’t sure, but she didn’t want to bring it up with Jake just yet. I tried dismissing it since it happened (I assume) a long time ago but it has been at the back of my mind ever since.

Fast forward to two days ago. I was in the supermarket when I ran into Jake (He lives close by). I saw him but he hadn’t seen me (Now that I think about it, he might have been avoiding me). I thought about walking up to him and say hello but I noticed his face was bruised and he had a cut over his brow. That was the final straw that made me even less sure about whether I wanted my daughter to be with him.

Yesterday I sat down with Sarah to talk about him. She told me she hadn’t been able to see her in the past few days because he's busy. I didn’t tell her that I’d seen he was beat up, instead I tried explaining her that I didn’t think he was a good influence for her, and that I wanted her to reconsider the relationship. She got very upset, started lashing out at me and telling me I didn’t know what I was talking about, that I couldn’t even give him a chance, that I didn’t know him, that I didn’t trust her, etc. I tried arguing but she went to her room and hasn’t talked to me since.

I thought about being firm about this and telling her I wouldn’t let her see him anymore, and that’s when I considered if I'm being too harsh. On one hand, she loves him and he loves her, and she's happy. On the other, I’ve never been sure about this kid. His dad’s in prison, he didn’t go to college, he doesn’t seem interested on having a relationship with me, now I learn he might have been a delinquent and that he might have gotten in a fight. I might be taking this personally from my experience with her father, but in my mind I'm just protecting her from getting hurt. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

So I’ll try to cut this short because I really need a verdict quickly;

I DoorDashed some Chik-Fil-A and told my girlfriend beforehand that I would order food for her if she wanted any. She said no, and I warned her that I wouldn’t give her any of my food. ANY. Not even a bite. 

You see, she has a habit of taking a bit of my food even when she says she’s not hungry, like most girlfriends do, but I usually tell her that I’m really hungry and want to eat all of my food. In the moment she says that she isn’t hungry and won’t ask for any of my food, but then 40 minutes later when it arrives she takes like half. I end up staying hungry, and in the past when I tried to stop her, she claimed I was body-shaming her. 

Anyway, this time, my food arrived and I refused to give her any of it. When she came near my food, I got up, moved a bit away, and told her that I asked her to get her own food  and she refused so she couldn’t have any of my food. She started screaming at me and left my house. She got her friends to blow up my phone and they told me that if I wanted a queen, I had to earn her, and if I wanted a whore, I should buy one.

His birthday's in a few days and I got him a couple of things I thought he would like, I spent over $50 for everything, and I've decided that I don't want to give him those things and would rather just keep it for myself because his behavior these past two weeks has been fucking terrible. 

&#x200B;

We share a game room but he's adamant about it being ""only his"" because his Xbox is there. He never lets me watch shit there or spend time in there even though I'm the one that 1) helped paint it, 2) helped get the new furniture, 3) cleans it, 4) and had the idea to put doors to the entrance (which he now uses to lock me out). I'm just incredibly frustrated that he refuses to let me spend time in a room that is also my own. Nothing I say makes any difference, he refuses to let me watch movies/TV shows there and I'm just really fucking tired of arguing while he laughs at me and tells me to ""get out of his room"".

bzii5f	2019-06-11 21:34:01		AITA for taking my sister’s car that my parents gave to me?	"Throwaway account since my friends and family know my real one.

This happened during last school year 2018-2019 kinda at the beginning. My sister is in college,  and at the time of the incident she was an incoming freshman. 

I have an older sister and she's a sophomore in college right now. She bought a car when she was 15 or 16 years old (I forgot), but gave the money to our parents to do the transaction so the title is in their name. It's not a new car or anything fancy, but I know she saved up a lot to buy it. Now, our family is a bit dysfunctional, and I'm not going to go into detail about it but just as a reference I want to let you know that once I turn 18 I'm moving out as fast as I can. But my sister and our parents have a worse relationship. 

Now, I'm not really sure what happened to cause this, but my parents are taking back the car. From what I understand, they say it's because the family could use the car and she's going to college anyway so she won't need to use it. She can't really do anything about it because A,) it'll cause a lot of undue family drama B.) she doesn't actually own the car, so it's not hers legally.

Now my dad gave me the car as I'm 17 this year and I need it to get to school (it's a 45 minute drive each way. We moved but I wanted to stay at the same high school because all of my friends are there). My sister hasn't said anything to me about the situation, and I haven't talked to her about it either, but I did share this with some of my friends and they say it's kinda an asshole move to take the car as I didn't pay for any of it, and it was only really given to me out of spite. I don't want to give the car back to my sister because I don't want to cause drama myself (and make my life worse because I have to live with them until I’m 18), and because she hasn't talked to me about it at all, but through the grapevine I've heard that she's irritated but not so much that she's actually mad at me.

Now I know my parent's are assholes for doing this, but am I the asshole for taking it? Or do you have any suggestions on what I could do in this situation. Anything helps, thank you!"	Asshole	1	0
bzii3x	2019-06-11 21:33:55	Gh0stchild1	AITA for thinking someone copied a tv show character	" I am in a My Hero Academia group on DeviantART, and I saw someone had posted art of Tokoyami and their oc and I got interested because of the character's design. To my dismay and suspicion, the characters design reminded me too much of Rena Rouge from Miraculous Ladybug. 

I told a friend who brushed it off at first because she thought I was overreacting a bit. But the more I looked at the oc I saw that her powers were similar to Rena's. I had enough and had only said Rena Rouge in the comments which upset her. 

She blocked me after a bit of talking then posted on her status ""How to explain to a person that plagiarism and inspiration are completely different things? The charges of plagiarism are repeated, just kill me, please… "" and everyone is on her side without even looking at the conversation we had. Her character was also created after Rena Rouge was introduced, that's what led me to believe she copied her design. So, am I in the wrong for saying how I feel about her characters design? 

Our convo:

Me: Rena Rouge 

Her: I was just inspired by this character.  My Os fully original character 

Me: Dude, you literally took Rena's power as well as most of her design...

Her:  Then tell me why are you still here? If you don’t like something, the door is open, I’m not holding anyone. If you have objections, then better keep your opinion with you. And what do you think I stole the design?  Ears and mask?  This is called inspiration, not theft.  This is normal when you are inspired by someone and create your character.  ask anyone who follows my page, they will confirm that the character is completely original. 

Me:  ""Her special ability is called Mirage, and she uses it by playing her flute, which creates an orange energy ball at its tip. She then swings the flute to throw the energy ball, creating an illusion wherever it lands.""   
That's from the Rena Rouge wiki... Your character has the same illusion power so sorry for being upset about it but I adore Miraculous Ladybug a lot and it kinda upsets me when your character looks too much like Rena and has the same power as her."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Now when I was told I was eligible for this money (my mum told me) I was told it would only be around 100 each payment, so naturally I agreed when my mum said that the money should be split 50/50 to help with food shopping (I’m particular about food due to my autism). Then when the payments were quite a bit more my parents still wanted half (I believe they knew how much it would’ve actually been).

For the past year I have been complaining about how much money they want off of me as now I have a little bit of money I have become responsible for clothes and other things. Well now whenever I complain my dad says pay the “board” money or I can take my money and get out of his house.

So recently my sister, who lived in CA, passed away. My mom also moved there a few years ago and has now moved back. She lived with me for a few weeks until this situation happened. The plan was that after me and my husband built a house, she would move into my current duplex. Now she’s and old woman (85) and is very set in her ways. She wanted to add on to the place bc she has a lot of stuff. This is, however, an issue. She’s not very patient and wanted to do it ASAP. My fiancé was not happy with this, and she became bitter, like old ladies do. So we decided to kick her out. She was staying at my other sisters place and has now found an apartment.

A new guy recently joined my department and he NEVER STOPS TALKING. I don't mind when he's talking on the phone or when he's talking to other people, but it's usually to himself. For eight hours a day, I hear him narrate his every move. 

Stuff like ""Alright, here we go, last thing I have to do before lunch. Man it's been a crazy day. Here you go buddy, you can do it.""
or
""Yummy yummy yummy yummy"" when he's eating his lunch. 

It's all day long. He also just grunts loudly very regularly, and even though I sit 2 desks away from him, my clients can hear him through my phone and always ask if everything is okay. 

I need to do something to address the situation because I'm going insane. My boss does not address problems, unless you count gossipping. When people go to her with problems with other coworkers, she usually just bad-mouths the problem person to other people in the department instead of talking to them. The new guy is nice and I don't want to sabotage his future here by creating gossip about him.

I'm thinking about writing a note to him asking him to please stop talking to himself so much because it is hard to focus when he does it all the time. I wouldn't sign it, I would just leave it on his desk after he goes home.

My mom and I have a great relationship and are incredibly close. I love her so much, but she's always done one thing that frustrates me to no end--fixates on her weight. For as long as I can remember, she's talked about how she doesn't like her body and wishes she could be thinner. I tell her she's beautiful (and she actually is--I'm not just sugar coating this for her sake) and healthy (which she is--she's a little overweight but can run 5 miles at the age of 65) but she never listens. It got to the point where I formed an unhealthy relationship with food myself (complete with bulimia), something I've been working on with a therapist for the past couple of years. 

Fast forward to last fall. She got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She ended up having her pancreas removed in a long and very stressful surgery. Despite living across the country from my parents, I was by her side through every hard decision and for two weeks after surgery while she recovered. Luckily, the surgery was successful, and the doctors are hopeful that she's cancer free.

One of the side effects of this surgery was weight loss. She's lost something like 40 pounds in the last five months. The thing is, she won't stop talking about it. Every time I talk to her on the phone she brings up the new clothes she has to buy or asks if she can send selfies because she's ""skinny now"". I'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons: it reminds me of her cancer and the horrible time we went through during the diagnosis and subsequent treatment, it makes me worry that if she gains it back she'll be even more unhappy, and it reinforces that her self image is tied to weight.

I don't want to ask her to stop saying these things because she deserves some happiness after all she's been through, but I secretly resent her every time she brings it up.

Friend and I met about a year ago but we hadn't talked much until a few months ago. She has a bad habit of occasionally leaving me on read for a week until I message her again, but when we talk, we can literally message/voice call for an entire day. She's the only person I've met in the last few years who gives me more than 5 minutes of attention even though she has no obligation.

A month ago she said she would show up for a talent show I would be in, to myself and other people, and talks about it once in a while. She left me on read over this weekend and the talent show happened earlier this week. I didn't confirm with her if she was going because she left my last message on read, thinking she was busy, but on her social media she posted (timestamped during the talent show) that she was out with friends at starbucks. She hasn't messaged me at all either - no apology and no acknowledgement that she missed the talent show, but she has liked other people's photos of the talent show. I understand that the talent show isn't exactly fun to sit through (food isn't great either), but she was always the one to talk about it first.

WIBTA for ghosting her until she messages me (which may be indefinitely), at which point I tell her I'm disappointed in her for not showing up but even more disappointed in her for not even bothering to tell me that she wouldn't show up?

bziber	2019-06-11 21:17:46	improbablytheahole	WIBTA if we don't want my cousin's daughter to be our flower girl?	"A couple months back my mother got together with my fiancée and her mother to talk about wedding plans. At that time a flower girl was brought up. Her side doesn't have any girls young enough to do it, but mine does. I'm not super close with my cousin and I've only met this girl twice, both times when she was so young she wouldn't have a clue who we are and arguably we don't know her. Nobody had asked her to be in our wedding at this point.

Fast forward a month and we've come to the conclusion that we aren't going to have a flower girl. It's only going to be siblings and friends in the bridal party. My mother starts a group chat with me, my fiancée and her mother and the topic of a flower girl comes up. We jokingly say my fiancée's little brother will do it, and she says my cousin's daughter can. I call her up 10 minutes after she said that to tell her we aren't planning on having a flower girl, and then the drama begins. She says she's already asked her if she will.

We just kind of facepalmed for the last week. We don't know this girl, and we weren't planning on having a flower girl. There are 3 weeks left until the wedding. We decided to have my mother back out of the obligation since she started it. I called her up and told her and she questioned how many of my fiancée's side of the family is in the wedding vs my side like it matters. I explained to her that we just want friends and siblings involved. My Fiancée has 3 siblings, I have 1.

I feel like there are multiple failures in communication here. We failed to tell my mother that we weren't going to have a flower girl, and she failed to ask us if we wanted my cousin's daughter to be the flower girl. We failed to immediately decide, and now it may look like we're backing out for another reason. We're now concerned that my cousins will be disgruntled and won't come or will cause a fight at or after the wedding. At this point in time she is still planned to be in our wedding.

I should also point out that my fiancée's youngest brother is going to be our ring bearer. Which to my understanding usually walks down with the flower girl by his side.

Are we the assholes for not wanting a flower girl in our wedding?



Edit: To clarify they DID talk about having a flower girl when they first met. So my mom was under the impression that we wanted one and presumably the same one they discussed when they first talked about it since nobody had expressed any feelings against it yet. Joking about having her little brother be it, probably didn't help."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I have been craving McDonald’s, kfc, all that gorgeous greasy fatty goodness and because my diet is doing so well I put a blanket ban on all fast food in the house. 

At first my man was 100% for it and told me whatever made my life easy but for the last month or so he’s been wanting to get fast food and I’ve told him he’s welcome to go eat out or in the car but it’s not coming in the house.

bzi86t	2019-06-11 21:10:13		AITA for not wanting to lunch with an annoying co-worker	"Not sure if I’m TA in this situation, so here goes.

I have a co-worker who has been getting on my nerves in various ways, though she gets along very well with my two regular lunch buddies at work and always requests to join us for lunch.

I had tried going out for lunch with this co-worker and found myself rather unhappy being in her company. I don’t discuss my dating life at work, but she has made a few inappropriate remarks about finding me a boyfriend, even though she doesn’t know whether I’m attached or single. 

She is also not a great team player and has refused to help me out with a very minor task because she didn’t want to take on extra work (I was desperately swamped, and it was the first time I had asked her for a reasonable favour that would take less than 5 minutes of her time to do). 

She has started sensing my annoyance with her and is extra friendly to me to perhaps mend things (though not to the point where she helps with tasks; some of our team members have also pointed out that she resolutely prefers to do the bare minimum). 

I’m frustrated with the way she is, and would rather avoid her at work. She’s not well-liked by our team, and has to lunch with my little group where we’re generally more easygoing, though even I get annoyed by her. 

But it becomes an AITA issue because my frustration with this person is now causing awkwardness in our lunch group. My lunch buddies continue to invite her to lunches we have planned beforehand, even though they know how I feel. Their reason is that they feel bad about saying no to her, especially since she might see us lunching without her and feel hurt. 

They don’t see why I can’t get over my annoyance (they don’t work directly with her and thus don’t have to handle her work attitude), as they think she’s fun to hang out with. After I said honestly that I don’t enjoy lunching with her, but can still show up to avoid making my lunch buddies the awkward middlemen, they stopped asking me out for lunches altogether. They also have a group chat with the co-worker that doesn’t include me. 

I get that they are probably trying to minimize my discomfort by excluding me from something I don’t enjoy, but it just makes me feel hurt and left out and somewhat betrayed. I wonder if I’m TA here, simply for not liking a co-worker and not wanting to spend a precious lunch hour in her company. I didn’t plan on having a talk with this co-worker about her behaviour because I don’t want to start unnecessary drama and make it a big deal, and in the big picture, it really isn’t.

The newest person who joined a few months ago is, Em, although we have similar interests she's been kind of problematic as a friend and co-worker. She's late daily, will need a ride, crys about personal issues at work, and makes video talking about us which has made a few friends uncomfortable.

I can't describe how close we are and how much I like her.

Similarly, I've been friends with this dude for 3 years too, and I could say that he's a close friend of mine and my entire group.

Well he has always hated the girl (my crush) until I got him and the other guys into getting to know her more by playing some playstation together (ik kinda immature lol). Anyways, recently he started saying to my other friend about how much he hated my crush and he couldn't stand her  (he doesn't know that I have a crush on her btw). My other friend told me that  he told him that and I was fine with it as long as he doesn't do anything bad to her or hurt her emotionally.

Surprisingly, he started talking to her privately and I honestly don't know what they talk about, but it gets me kinda uncomfortable and betrayed by how my friend that says he hates her, and then starts talking to her the next day. So, I've been considering telling on him lately, and tell my crush how he's always been trash talking and backstabbing her. So AITA if I risk losing his friendship or the friendship of my other friends to tell my crush that shes being backstabbed by a fake guy? My other friend agrees with me but I honestly don't know what to do.

PS. he has a history about saying how much he hates a girl and then starting to talk to her and having a crush on her, that's what he did with my other friend. So that's what I'm afraid of."		1	0
bzi5od	2019-06-11 21:04:32	resjudicata8	WIBTA if I were to write my boss an anonymous note regarding his visible erection?	"My senior colleague/boss isn't sexually harassing me. I just want to get that out of the way. 

This has been ongoing for several months now, and since it just happened again this afternoon, I'm near a breaking point where I feel like I need to say something. 

My senior colleague/boss often drops in my office to get my thoughts on matters related to work. I appreciate those unplanned visits and the visits show he values my input. However, many times he comes in with an erection that is obvious, and most of the time he just stands on the other side of my desk rather than sit. At first I thought maybe he and the other partners were playing a prank on me. But this has gone on too long and with sufficient regularity for it to be an office prank. I would say it happens at least once a week, for the past several months. 

I don't know if he is aware that his erections are highly visible, and I certainly don't know if this condition is a side effect of a medication or a medical problem itself. So I haven't discussed it with anyone, out of embarrassment for myself and for him. But I cannot be the only one to notice or be bothered by this. 

I'm thinking of writing him an anonymous note to let him know that his visible erection makes some people uncomfortable in the office and to ask him to be mindful. I am not going to HR or telling anyone else because I don't want to make a big deal out of this.

bzi3uv	2019-06-11 21:00:27	costaine	WIBTA if I make my girlfriend stop talking to her ex?	"Backstory: 
I have been friends with my girlfriend for five years and about six months ago, we started getting a lot closer. Three months ago, she went on a break with her boyfriend and we started becoming more than friends. They have always had an abusive relationship and he actually is like seven years older and I find him to be a bad influence on her. 

   During the break, he was so distant from her and couldn’t have given a shit about her, but about two months into our relationship, he found out about me and freaked out. He started showing affection for her once he found out he was going to lose her and she continued to talk to him. She says that she still loves him, but she just wanted to talk as friends and have him in her life. However, I have seen their conversations and he still calls her ‘baby girl’ and ‘princess’ and they both tell each other they love each other and stuff like that and she won’t tell him to stop because it would hurt his feelings. 
   
   He has flat out said that he doesn’t want to be just friends and he still has feelings for her. Throughout our relationship, I told her that I would never be comfortable with calling us ‘official’ unless she cut her ex off. 

   Just a couple days ago, she asked me to become official and it was great. However, I told her that she would have to stop talking to him and cut him off. I was with her when she told him they wouldn’t be able to talk anymore and he got so emotional. He kept calling and texting and sending voice recordings of him crying and I just saw it as him being manipulative to get her back. 

   I went on her phone and blocked him without her knowledge because I didn’t want her getting manipulated by him and deleted the messages he sent. I felt really horrible doing it and I knew that was an asshole move, but I was getting so affected by it that I snapped. Yesterday, she called me and said what I did was wrong and that I had violated her trust and she was going to have to keep talking to him because he doesn’t have anyone else to help him and she doesn’t want him hurting. I told her that I snapped and that was a sign that he was an unhealthy part of our relationship and needed to go. 

   I don’t know what to do now because he will continue to manipulate her unless she stops talking to him and it is really really getting to me. Will I be the asshole if I make her stop talking to him and set that boundary in our relationship?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bzi3jh	2019-06-11 20:59:43	pensivemikkelegit	AITA for giving this opinion after I made sure it was consented to?	"A few friends of mine decided we'd separate ourselves from a larger social circle because there's a guy whose company makes us incredibly uncomfortable. We're not the biggest fan of him because he's generally manipulative, lies often, and is generally cruel, and we don't want to condone this behaviour by acting as though it doesn't bother us. He's also obnoxiously loud and seems to want to dominate whatever room he's in. We're the quieter sort, and he'll talk over us more or less because he can. We don't like him. I think our decision to move away from that is completely reasonable.

We have a friend inside this social circle who was confused about why we stopped hanging around with them. Keeping in mind... he becomes very argumentative when people challenge the integrity of his friends and will be quick to pass the information on anyhow, I didn't want to tell him. However, he kept asking so I eventually caved and said something along the lines of, ""We're very uncomfortable in this person's company and can't chill when we're here.""

That wasn't enough, seeing as he then asked why we don't like him. He couldn't get it, he told me. 

I made sure that I asked if he really wanted me to tell him why. He explicitly said yes.

So I explained why we think this guy's a manipulative arsehole and... maybe I took it a bit far by citing examples? I didn't want to leave room for argument in the matter. I was simply informing, not trying to change his mind. It was a long explanation.

Now, I don't think that this was chatting shit. I'm not certain though. The friend I explained it to has now started airing me whenever I try to drop a message and refuses to speak to me in any other circumstance.

bzi19j	2019-06-11 20:54:20		AITA for calling my friend ‚lazy pig‘?	"Ok, little bit of background:

4 years ago, I had an accident, where I heavily injured my back. I couldn’t really move for 10 months and was more or less bound to my bed.

During that time, I put on around 90lbs. 
After I recovered, I vowed to myself to lose what I put on an then some. I started to train extremely hard, flipped over my nutrition completely and managed to lose 100lbs and put on some muscles.

I found new friends in the gym, which helped me with training and they became very close to me.

That’s when my friend (let’s call him J) comes into play.

J is my best friend since pre school. We went through thick and thin, through hard and great times. He is what I would truly consider a brother from another mother.

After my accident, he was always there for me, lighting up my mood by making stupid jokes and bringing some games along that we could enjoy together.

But everything started to deteriorate after I recovered.
To put it bluntly: J is insanely obese. It never bothered me that much, but it increasingly became a topic of discussion after I started to lose weight.

I have to admit, between college, training, my SO and my new friends he came a bit short.

So we talked about it and I offered him to come along with me for training. That way we could spend more time together and he could also lose some weight like he wanted for a long time.

He suddenly became very hurt, calling me a bully for shoving my new physique into his face by dragging him into the gym. 
I tried to calm him down saying that it really wasn’t my intention to hurt him, but he kept on saying, that I changed and after I found some ‚cool new friends‘ (I’m sure he is referring to my training buddies) he wasn’t cool enough anymore and more of an embarrassment.

I tried again and again to tell him, that this isn’t the case and that working out has nothing to do with me trying to bully him and that it was more of a health thing and trying to prove to myself, that I can come back even after more or less being paraplegic for 10 months.

He kept on going about how he doesn’t work out and is still in good health and that the gym has become more important to me than he is. He got angrier and started to call me names. That’s when I said: ‚If you weren’t such a lazy pig going with me to the gym to finally achieve what you are trying to for years wouldn’t be such a big problem.‘

He abruptly stopped and left instantly. I tried to call him multiple times, but he doesn’t answer his phone.

My SO says, that I wasn’t wrong in pushing him to get healthier and defending my point, but the way I did it was too tactless.
My friends are on the same ship as my SO.

bzi15i	2019-06-11 20:54:03	Moviesmoviespiemovie	WIBTA for ok’ing having kids, but not wanting to put in any effort to actually look after said kid?	"We’re both really young, so nothing is going to come of this anytime soon. I wanted to see if I’m being a total asshole here. We’re 26.

I don’t want kids, my partner does. It wasn’t a consideration when we both got together because we were super young. 16 to be exact. 

He always told me that “not having kids is no big deal with him,” and “he’s fine with that,” and “he never wanted kids anyway,” but I think I was kidding myself by believing that. 

He loves kids. When he was in high-school, he use to babysit for our entire neighborhood. He was awesome with them, and everyone trusted him. Even with the babies. When one of our friends got pregnant, he was happy and smiling for a full on week. He always wanted updates. Said he would help with anything. All our neighbors kids love him. He worked at daycares during college. He’s a cook now, but he said he would have loved to be a teacher. He was a huge help in raising his siblings. He has more of a parent-caretaker relationship with them than a sibling one. 

So, yeah, I’m kidding myself when I believed his nonsense about not wanting kids. So, we got drunk one night and I asked him why he always says he doesn’t want kids even though he seems to love them. He was basically like, “because I get to be with you. I’m fine with giving that up, even though it really sucks. I know you’ve never wanted kids.” 

And I don’t. I’ve never particular liked kids. At least not enough to put my job and life on hold. I definitely don’t want to be the host of one. But knowing that he’s giving up something he clearly wants a lot to be with me hurts. 

I’ll never want to be the host of a child, but something like a surrogate is an option. But I’d straight up not want to have to change diapers or wake up in the middle of the night. I’m about to be a doctor, and I definitely don’t want this to impact my career at all. I’m such a bad person. I just had other things I would rather do than have kids, but I feel BAD he clearly wants them so bad. I would love my kid so much. I didn’t want to have them because of all the effort involved so...

WIBTA if I said he could have a kid, but I don’t want to be involved in doing the heavy lifting? 

The thing is I like kids, I just don’t want to put in all the effort. If he’s willing to do that, fine. I don’t want it to impact my career. 

I like looking after kids for an evening, and I find it to be fun, but I also enjoy sending them home and not having to deal with the diapers, etc myself.... 

Is this a terrible idea? Am I being a total asshole right now? I thought I’d send this to reddit before bringing anything up with him. 

I sound like some of those shit dads that’s never cleaned a diaper and just gets their SO to do everything even though the kids is theirs too... Is that me? Yikes then I’m a total asshole, right?"	Asshole	0	0

My girlfriend (O) is not invited as whilst she is in our close, fairly small friendship group, she's not on our course but still goes to the same university.  She'll also be finishing all her work for the year on the same day as us.

I could understand S not inviting O if our friendship group extended out of our course, but there's literally just 2 of our close friends being excluded from this party.

O initially asked about coming but S said it was just for our course. This pissed me off a bit and I also asked a few days later gaining the same response, but after making the point that it was basically just excluding 2 of our friends for seemingly little reason S has said my girlfriend can come. Her responses were really blunt though and she seemed annoyed.

I know that it's S's party and she can invite who she wants but O did feel left out as though she was being excluded on purpose for another reason. The only thing I can think of is that they've had a slightly strained friendship due to some of O's actions, but that was over a year ago and we've had lots of perfectly fine social events since."		1	0

So like, a half hour ago I (21F) was driving in the car with my mom and we were talking about the SSRI that I take.  I have pretty severe OCD, along with depression/general anxiety.  I've been having some bad side effects from the SSRI related to bad/stressful dreams, so she was saying how I should just keep trying to take them in the morning, as my psychologist suggested, and talk to her again if it still doesn't help.  As she was saying this though she kept mentioning ""we,"" as in ""all we can do is try, we just have to keep working at it,"" etc.  I was already in a bad mood (which she could tell because I'm not very good at hiding it) so she asks ""What, are you mad at me now?""  I kinda was but I say I'm not, she keeps pressing it, so I  snapped at her a bit, saying that it's not a ""we"" problem it's an ""I"" problem, because I'm the one who has to put in the work to overcome my mental illness.  She then says, obviously sarcastically, ""Oh, right.  Of course, this only affects YOU.""  We didn't say anything else for the rest of the car ride, and now I've holed myself up in my room.

Now I'd like to think that I'm not tone-deaf enough to think that my mental illness doesn't affect my loved ones--of course it does.  I love my mom dearly and she loves me, so she doesn't want to see me suffering from this.  That being said, when she says ""we"" it kinda feels like she's belittling my mental illness in a way, or belittling the effort that I've been putting in to overcome this.  I try to be open with her, but there's a lot of work I'm putting into overcoming this that she doesn't know about, and she doesn't have to directly experience it.

I clearly upset her--I do understand why and I feel like I should apologize, but on the other hand, I still feel how I feel and how I feel is that this is my own issue to overcome.  While it does affect her by proxy, she doesn't understand what's going on in my head because of the mental illness.  And honestly, she's more understanding about these things than I could hope for, but every once in a while we do get into a fight like this.  I do think I could've said it a bit more nicely, but I still stand by what I said.  AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

I walked/ran with the dog, my step daughter, who is 4, rode her bike, my partner walked until we went past her mothers house, when she borrowed her mums bike. 

We got to the park and I ran a few laps around to tire the dog out while partner and step daughter played. It started getting late and we had to be home by about 4 as we were going to a family dinner for my aunt, she was having surgery for breast cancer the following day. 

I got back to where they were playing and suggested we leave so that we could start getting ready. Neither of them wanted to, and kept playing. All 3 of us needed showers and i know they take a while to get ready. While they finished what they were doing, I went for one more run with the dog, as i was running away step daughter was calling for me because she wanted to come too. I had a hoodie up, was running away from them and didn't hear her, when i got back they were both upset that i didnt stop and wait. 

On our way home, my partner stopped at her mums to return the bike, her daughter went inside with her. We live about 150m from her mum so I continued home to start getting ready. I didn't tell them that i was going home, they beat me to her mums and were inside by the time i got there. 

When they came out, step daughter was upset that i had left, its a straight line from partners mums place to ours so they could see me walking home. When they got home i was already in the shower, my partner slammed the door open pulled the curtain back and yelled at me that I am to never hurt her daughter like that again.

bzhuie	2019-06-11 20:38:35	catastrophe_mom	AITA for selling a design of a GENERIC anthro dog?	"Not my main account. This is a response to a post previously made by a now ex-friend who used to share accounts via discord.

I'm an artist, and I make my living mostly through commissions, but I frequently do character adopts (Pre-designed characters for sale). I recently sold a design of an anthro character. This character was a Husky, with natural husky colors (black and white, very generic pattern), a red dog collar with a bone name tag, and bright blue eyes. I designed this character to sell quickly, and it did, for a higher than average price because it came with a custom commission of the character.

Fast forward, my ""friend"" says he got a message from the person who bought the design and is claiming he stole it, since his OC is also a GENERIC looking husky with a red dog collar. (The patterns were modeled off of an actual dog) and a less common design of a triskellion that looks very similar to what my friend's character has on its chest.

My friend told the buyer I stole the design, and they then both collaborated on a callout post to defame me. I have lost business over this, because they have lied about the details of the transaction. I understand the confusion, because yeah, the characters do look quite similar.

I am not a thief, and I had no idea my friend even HAD this husky character. I told him he should have talked to me about this if he had a problem, but he has now blocked me after the situation escalated. He still insists I stole his character. I asked that he be suspended from the group chat until things work out because he's trying to pit my other friends against me, but now he's claiming I'm an asshole for thinking his behavior is toxic and for ""stealing"" his fursona.

bzht5d	2019-06-11 20:35:23	underwinterfox	AITA for wanting to discontinue supporting my little sister's education?	"A brief background of my life: I am the eldest (28y/o guy) among my 2 siblings. My two little sisters are aged 23 and 10. My dad died 7 years ago. He was the breadwinner but I had to replace him. My mother doesn't work. She takes care of us at home. I live on my own 2 hours away from home. My 23y/o sister, Sarah, and 10y/o Reigh, still lives with mom.

&#x200B;

So here the story: Sarah and I decided to split the bills since she has already got a job. She pays the electric and water bills, service bus of Reigh, as well as the continuing payment of Reigh's tuition fee monthly. I give them a monthly allowance, and the down payment for Reigh's tuition fee, our family car's yearly renewal of registration and maintenance while also paying for my own apartment and food. I used to stay there during the weekends but for the past year or 2, I've been going there less to save money. That meant I wasn't able to spend time with my family as much but we still talk online on a regular basis. Recently, my visits to them became really strained because of Reigh. I hate it but I think Reigh hates me. We're not close anymore. She's become disrespectful to me, and always throws tantrums when I'm there. She has even thrown a sandal at me because I was playfighting her and she said it hurts her but I SWEAR it didn't. This hurts me because I really miss them so much and I just want to show affection to Reigh but she just rejects me. It makes me feel estranged and I lost connection with her. I know Sarah and my mom talked to her about her treatment with me.

&#x200B;

 This whole thing makes me feel kinda angry because it feels like they're just milking money out of me when I really get nothing in return. I feel like I could be living a life with all the money I am earning but here I am giving half of it out for my family of 2 adults. At this point, the responsibility of supporting them feels like a burden. Don't get me wrong, I love them with all my heart and I'm supporting them out of my own will and conscience. Sarah earns very little since she has just started. My mom can't work yet because she has to tend to Reigh.

"My mom made me a dentist appointment without telling me while I'm sick, she gave me a 2 day notice on it and I told her I still didn't want to if I was still sick by then. Come today I still don't want to go out cause I don't feel great yet. She yells at me saying that she had to cancel a year ago too because of the same thing. I said that it your fault for making it without asking me first because I surely can't commit to something that I didn't make. Now were pissed at each other and she is insinuating that I'm in the wrong.

bzhpr1	2019-06-11 20:27:36	BlueEyedSpencer	AITA for not telling my best friend things I told someone we both know?	"TLDR at bottom. Names changed. 

So my best friend Amy, introduces me to the guy she was talking to, Aaron. Aaron and I became friends while they were seeing each other and she was happy about it. Aaron is a nurse and I was trying to get into the same field so we would talk about medical things and we’re just friends. We’d pop up in each other texts occasionally, me asking about a medication or him because he needed someone to talk to about how annoying a patient was/the bullshit the hospital did. 

Amy was fine with all of this, she didn’t care that we were friends and encouraged that we talked often and become closer friends on our own. A few months ago I asked him a question about my birth control right after a bad breakup because I planned on sleeping with this guy. Aaron asked some questions about the guy, so I answered. That was the end of that. 

Now, Amy and Aaron have broken up and she’s saying “it’s sketchy how much more he knows about your life than I do” so I asked what she meant. she brought up the conversation I just told you about because he mentioned it to her. I said “I asked him a question about my birth control, he asked a few questions about the guy I was sleeping with. That’s the only reason he knows”. I ask if there’s anything else and she says no,. Then she goes in saying “I just think it’s funny how you’re telling Aaron, who you met because of *ME*,  all this stuff when you haven’t even mentioned it to me, your best friend of *6 YEARS*”. She’s asexual and completely sex repulsed by any mention of sex, so I normally don’t share my sex life with her. 

She’s now mad and accusing me of sleeping with him (he lives 1,000 miles away) and being just like her ex and ex best friend who slept together. I’m offended because I was there when it all happened and say “well I’m not Chelsea”. she keeps going on this rant about me being like Chelsea. So I snap and say “well I’m not Chelsea so get that idea and insecurity the fuck out of here. I’m not dealing with it” . She’s now telling me I can’t be friends with Aaron anymore since they broke up and I told her she doesn’t get to dictate who I’m friends with.

TLDR: best friend encourages her bf and I to become friends, bf is a nurse so I regularly ask question which he doesn’t mind. question is asked about birth control, he inquired about guy I’m sleeping with. Months later they break up, she’s mad I didn’t tell her about the guy I was sleeping with and accuses me of sleeping with bf just like her ex best friend did with her last ex. I snap and tell her I’m not the ex best friend and to get that shit out of her because I’m not dealing with it. She’s telling me I can no longer be friends with bf since they now broke up and I told her she doesn’t dictate who I’m friends with.

bzhoui	2019-06-11 20:25:36	grilledcheesepie	AITA for refusing to walk a girl to her Uber at a club?	"I was partying on Saturday night with my friends, when I bumped into my sister and her friends. I’m pretty cool with my sis, and a lot of her friend group bleeds into mine cuz we’re only a year apart. I met this absolutely gorgeous girl who was with them & who was immediately flirty, touchy, kept asking me to buy her drinks. We hit it off and spent A LOT of time dancing together, drinking, etc. 

As the night progressed I got drunker and drunker, but I guess my brain went into paranoid mode and I couldn’t really enjoy my time with this chick because I kept noticing she kept trying to ‘offer’ to buy our drinks by taking my wallet up to the bar, kept yelling ‘bro, pass me your phone I wanna take pictures outside’ and stuff like that. I kinda disconnected from her and went to sit with my bros and sober up. 

After around an hour she told me she was heading up to go home and asked if I’d walk her out to her Uber. I said hell no girl, you’re grown, go yourself. She started cussing me out and calling me a pussy, then left. My friends witnessed this and told me to stay where I was and not to engage with her cuz I was yelling stuff back but I really did get the vibe she was trying to either steal shit from me or set me up to be jumped. 

The next day my sister called me in the afternoon telling me the girl had left a SHIT TONNE of messages in their group chat saying there were some sketchy guys who were freaking her out and all she wanted was someone big to walk her to her Uber but I’m a waste of muscle and space apparently and a giant ass pussy. Some of her friends were basically shit talking me because allegedly she’s ‘a really sweet girl’ and my sister and her friends had to shut them down but the consensus is I should have at least walked her outside. 

I told my stepdad this story via text cuz I’m close with him and he also agrees it was an asshole move for me to not walk her out. He also called me a monk lmao."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Long story made short I was on a hiking trail and after going through it 2 - 3 times I was pretty exhausted (it's about 200 steps up and another 20 min jog down the trail to the base of the stairs). On my 3rd time up I noticed that this dad and his son were also running the trail, but the teenager was legit BALLING his eyes out while running the trail and the dad kept telling him to ""suck it up"" and ""stop crying"". When he passed me I heard another couple saying that was the 12th time the kid had done the track ( can't confirm I didn't count). I thought for a moment about saying something to the kid and the dad because 1) it was odd to see & 2) the kid was clearly in shambles running & crying while embarrassed. In that moment I chose not to do anything because I don't know the situation at all. I scanned the kids face and legs for bruises when they came around again ( as that would have given me more of a reason to say something in my head) but I saw nothing. 

My assumption is that the kid was either in training and being pushed, or maybe he was being punished ( which I think this is a little barbaric) or something else not sure. 

So after a little debate with the boys some people think I should have said something others think it wasn't my business, Thoughts?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bzhmre	2019-06-11 20:20:51	stephanie482	WIBTA if I force my son to change schools his senior year?	"In March, we moved ~20 miles from the school district our kids (M17, F12 and F10) have attended their entire school career. I knew it would take time for them to adjust, so we decided to let them finish out this school year (which ends Thursday) at their current schools.

We are spending a considerable amount of gas and time shuffling three kids back and forth every day, especially since they all have different start/release times (one is in elementary, one is in middle school, and one is in high school).

My son (understandably) balked at the thought of not graduating with the class of kids he'd gone through school with. I get that. I'd be upset too! So my husband and I made him a deal. If he got a part time job and his driver's license, we would provide him with a car he could use to get himself back and forth to his preferred school. We would pay insurance; all he'd be responsible for would be gas.

He has yet to get a job, even though our neighbor set him up with a shoo-in interview. (He blew it off to go camping.) Ditto on the driver's license -- he needs 100 hours of driving practice before he can take the test, and he hasn't even started. But every time I mention anything about making progress toward our deal, he just says he's ""working on it.""

I can put myself in his shoes and see just how much it would suck to have to change schools right before the finish line. But he's made no progress and the deadline to submit the application to allow him to stay at his current school is next Monday. He knows this. He's begging me to sign the application now and promises he'll have it figured out by September. WIBTA if I tell him ""too little, too late?""

Edit, since people are asking: This wasn't a planned move (landlord sold our rental of 8+ years and our area is in a housing crisis. We're paying $350/mo. more so the kids are semi-close to their friends.) Also, he did know that we expected him to have a job/a line on a job/put in SOME SORT of effort BEFORE the deadline to submit the app to stay at his current school."	Asshole	0	0
bzhmqa	2019-06-11 20:20:45	npmorgann	AITA for not completing this video project?	"I had a friend in college who asked me to film the progression of his senior project and make it into a short documentary. I think he hoped I would make it my senior project as well. I didn’t see enough potential in the story to do that, but I kept shooting his progress as a favor, and because I said I’d make him something for his senior project presentation. I even paid a shooter to cover a day when I couldn’t shoot his session because of (paid) work.

This was no small amount of work on my part, and I pulled a third all-nighter in a row on my last finals week in college to get him his video for his presentation as well as complete all the other films I was doing post for. His question was “when’s the full version going to be done?”

This is the section where I know I was a bit of an asshole: I intended to work on his project, but I kept putting it off because I was struggling to work in my industry post grad to pay my bills. I literally worked for four-week stints without a weekend to try and build contacts and get enough work to pay rent. That’s an excuse in some ways, but I did keep stringing him along (though I did really intend to do the work)

I explained that to him, and he offered to pay me a little, but not nearly enough to cover the time I’d need to spend on it. 

At some point, I got fed up with him messaging me every two weeks asking if it was going to be done soon, and I told him he was going to have to get another editor. I took too long to do it, but I told him he could have the footage as soon as he could get me a hard drive to copy it to. He hasn’t messaged me since.

The whole thing was a favor to him, and I don’t see what possible benefit he thinks I’m going to reap from this - I delivered him something for the presentation because I said I’d do that, and I think my commitment is over. What do y’all think? AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

I’m a 16 year old male. Ok, so this morning I was mowing my neighbors lawn just as I normally do every Tuesday.  There’s this neighbor that has beef with my family that lives directly across from the lawn that I was mowing. I don’t know exactly why they don’t like us but I’m not to sure. I’ve never had this problem with her before but today she kept on making comments on my mowing. I like to do all the edges and corners first and then get the middle over with, but she kept telling me to do it the other way. Next, she kept commenting on the way I was holding and walking with the lawn mower which was odd. I told her I didn’t need her help anymore. She went back inside to her house. We don’t have any fences. Afterwords she brought her son outside and kept telling him want not to do and kept telling him what I was doing wrong. I finally snapped when she said “make sure you mow that patch better” and I replied with “you wanna come over and do it. She replied with “no” and I said “alright then, shut your fucking mouth.

My story starts back on New Years Day 2018, I obviously had been enjoying the festivities with my friends all night and into the early morning. I had been seeing my boyfriend since August at this point and we were making long distance work but had decided to spend the holidays in our hometowns. 

I had made the choice to take ecstasy that night and I was fleeing, having a great time. We all ended up at my friends flat, there was only 5 of us, and continued the party there. 

One of the guys I have known since I was 17 and we have been best friends all these years, we were comfortable sharing a bed so when we were finally ready to sleep we went to bed together. 

We didn't shag, just to make that clear. But we did kiss and fool around a bit. If you don't know ecstasy is also known as the ""love drug"" which I personally feel is very accurate. You just want to be near people and hold them. 

So after a few minutes of this I was beginning to feel bad and asked to stop, he kept begging me to keep doing what we were doing. 

I started to realise I had cheated and I had really fucked up. So yes I am the asshole for this but this is not what I am asking you to judge. 

I had decided to not tell my bf, to me what had happened was so insignificant and just a messy mistake between friends it was not worth hurting someone over. 

My ""friend"" didn't' understand this and wanted to tell my bf. We sat down some time after and I explained how I felt and told him that if I was to tell my bf, and he asked me to chose between him and you, that I would choose my bf. 

He agreed to not say anything and the incident was forgotten...

Until last week when I received a message telling me to tell my bf or he would because of the all the guilt he has.  

So I have told my bf and we are working through that but I am so hurt and angry that my choice was taken away from me.

Out of the blue he decided to drop a bomb on my relationship.

Am I The Asshole for wanting to keep this in the past and now cutting out my friend for how this has been handled?

bzhhdt	2019-06-11 20:08:17	throwmeawayy25	AITA for not asking future SIL to be a bridesmaid?	"Throwaway.  I am marrying my fiancé at the end of the year. We’ve been together for 5+ years. He has 2 siblings, I have a brother and stepsiblings. 
 
When my fiancé and I were dating, I made a lot of attempts to get to know his brother and SIL. They had been married for 2 years when we started dating. They moved out of town an hour away, so hanging out isn’t easy. We’d always ask them to go away with us for a weekend to my lake house, get dinner, or meet us half way for a drink. All attempts were a negative.
 
 Later on we get engaged and are bombarded with so much love and congrats from everyone, except SIL.
 
After the engagement we still try to make plans to no avail. After a while we stop because you can only hear no so many times. 
 
I don’t have many close girlfriends but the ones I have I hold close. I asked 2 friends from home, 1 college friend, and 2 friends I made in the town I live in. One of the girls just so happens to be my little future BILs girlfriend. To my defense we were friends before they even started dating.
 
At Thanksgiving, SIL finds out whose in my bridal party and completely ignores my fiancé and I. We kind of just brushed it off. After she walks out the door, his entire family turned and asked us what that was about? We couldn’t answer
 
The same things happens at Christmas time, but her mother was there and joined in on the fun of ignoring my fiancé and I.
 

Afterwards, we reach out to them to see what’s going on. BIL says she is upset she was not asked to be in the wedding. Fiancé explains her sisters aren’t in it, nor does SIL know anything about me, vice versa. We ask them to meet up with us to hash this out. Follow up 4+ times. They are not interested. 
 
 
2019 begins and planning picks up. A month ago we had a family party for a little baby in the family. Fiancé and I, BIL and SIL, future little BIL and bridesmaid are all there, including fiancés whole family. 
 
Knowing the subject is sensitive, I keep my mouth shut about the wedding. BIL (knowing how sensitive the subject is) asks what color the bridesmaids are wearing (he started it in my opinion). I don’t verbally answer but instead show him a pic of some of my bridesmaids in their dresses. Little future BIL says, “CAN I GO DOWN THE AISLE WITH GIRLFRIEND/BRIDESMAID?!” I don’t think SIL realized little future BILs gf was asked to be a bridesmaid.
 
All I hear is IM SO HURT HOW COULD YOU DO THIS!
 
Fiancé and I are like wtf, MIL chases after her. Its a shit show at a party for an infant. We leave confused and she ignores us again. (info on MIL and SIL: SIL didn’t include MIL in her wedding. I’ve included her in wedding planning, dress fittings, etc)
 
We repeatedly ask them to meet up with us to sort this out. They do not want to meet up because SIL is too hurt and feels like a victim. 
 
Last family party we had I ignored both of them because I’m dealing with enough shit.

Thanks to those who responded with kind words.

WIBTA if I involved my sick mother's family in her care?

&#x200B;

I'll try and make this quick. My mother has cancer (5th bout of cancer now, not looking great) and is not doing well.  She has previously beaten cancer several times but this looks like it might be the one that, well, you know.  Anyways, her condition is getting to the point where it's looking like she cannot or should not be living alone.  She needs help.  She's starting to fall, she's heavily medicated, etc. etc.  I'm afraid she's going to die alone in her home.  The problem is that she lives alone.  She is a TLC channel level hoarder and has isolated herself from most everybody except for one or two friends who help her out with errands and things. She gradually went no-contact with most everyone in her family over the last several years.  Her mother, brothers and sisters, and other family members are alive and well and living near her but she doesn't want to have any contact with them.  I (her only living daughter) am the only person she has regular contact with.

The problem is I live on the East Coast and my mom and all my other family live on the West Coast.  I am a single mom living paycheck to paycheck and I see the looming situation of what's on the horizon as being extremely difficult for me to manage on my own, financially, time-wise, the clean-up of her hoard home, managing my two little kids and my new career, etc.  It's not as simple as me moving back home to take care of her as my ex has expressly forbidden me moving back home with the kids to take care of my mom (with those unfamiliar you cannot move children across state lines without the other parent's permission) and there's no way in hell I would leave them alone to the train-wreck that is their father.  I know for a fact my mom does not want to become a burden on her family, for them to see the conditions she lives in, or to have to rely on them for anything but I honestly can't do it alone.  I want to tell her family, her mother and brother's and sister's what's going on so that she has a support system in place, people to help her out, a place to go if she needs it, etc.  My mother is still lucid enough where she would be furious if I involved her family but I simply can't do it alone...

bzhgji	2019-06-11 20:06:17	ThrowAwayAccount2783	AITA for being mad at my friend	"I'm not sure if my friend uses reddit but just to be sure I'm using a random account.

For some context though I don't really know if it's relevant, I am a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. I suffer from delusions such as victim complexes etc. I am admittedly prone to being overly aggressive when I feel like I could be hurt and I also admit to not being entirely sure when I am or aren't rightfully hurt or upset. I also have a lot of other issues with abandonment, etc, you get the idea.

We're going to call the friend in question John. John and I have been friends for about 2 years now but he is definitely one of the closest friends I have. John knows me pretty much inside and out and we have both confided in each other majorly in our entire friendship. However me and John both have significant issues and we can be prone to arguments but usually fix them in the end.

About a year ago I think, I introduced John to a group of friends that I know. We all get along but fast forward a bit. John is very personable and usually gets along well with most people. Another guy in this group, we'll call him David, has been getting along really well with John. Me and David are also good friends.

However, me and John have been talking less and less over the last few weeks, while John and David have been getting along very well.

This has admittedly made me feel very bad and, even though I know I shouldn't be, jealous. John has admitted that he has been spending time with David and tries to assure me I have nothing to worry about in terms of our friendship.

I can't help but feel upset as I had brought up the fact we've been talking less while he and David are openly interacting a lot more than me and John. Part of me is slighted because John wouldn't have met David if not for me. I know that's immature and petty but I can't help but think so.

I got angry at John today because I feel like he has been ghosting me to spend time with David, i.e he hasn't been speaking to me, sometimes completely stops speaking to me mid conversation. I brought these issues up with John and he not only denied it but insisted I was being ridiculous. 

I have a lot of history with friends growing apart from me for seemingly no reason (yes I fully accept I can be difficult to deal with but my friends have dropped me, sometimes almost venemously, despite my attempts to apologize and reconcile) and this is really hitting me in a dark place. 

I will provide any added context, etc if anyone asks. And no. I don't want to date John. I don't want to monopolize him because I want us to be together. We're both gay and of opposite genders.

I have a lot of trouble seeing the inherent flaws in what I do or say sometimes and I struggle a lot with people and understanding THEM. I will accept a verdict and any advice/criticism that comes with this post. It is appreciated."	Not enough info	0	0
bzhg2m	2019-06-11 20:05:16	ariinwonderland	WIBTA for calling out a friend for being a shitty interviewee	"Background; I worked at my last job for about 5 years before I got fed up and left. My current job I’ve been at for almost 2 years, and while it still has its flaws, it is exponentially better then my last job. 

When I left my coworker/friend “Jenny” was starting to be unhappy as well. Telling me it got worse after I left, and that she wanted to go somewhere else. So I recommended her at my work. She applied, got interviewed but didn’t get hired because she didn’t have the proper schooling/paperwork. (The old job allowed her to work regardless of the fact that it was illegal) they told her as soon as she paid for her schooling, or a different position opened up where she didn’t need it, they would hire her.

Well now, a year later, a position has opened up where she would qualify to work. I told her, and she called my boss to see what needed to be done. This is where everything got rocky. It took her about a week to fill out the application they asked her to do. And that was with me reminding her. Finally she did it, it went through, they called her to come in so they could start the hiring process. First, she completely forgot about the first appointment they made with her and she had to reschedule. Then today comes, and she waits until 5 hours before her appointment to call and tell them that she can’t make it and would like to reschedule till Friday. My management called her back and told her that they filled the position. But they came and told me that she was being flakey and super unprofessional and they were no longer interested which is fair. 

She later texted me and said that they went with someone else but it was fine cause she didn’t have the paper work any way (which she no longer needed)

I want to text her back and be like “no actually they decided not to pursue you because you kept flaking and it didn’t look good to them, if you ever want to get out of that job you should maybe prioritize your interviews more”  would that make me an asshole? Is it none of my business and I shouldn’t let it get in the way of our acquaintanceship/friendship.

TLDR; an old coworker I still talk to sometimes applied to my job, I vouched for them, and they flaked out of 2 interview times leading my job to tell her they went with someone else. Would I be the asshole to tell her that she needs to make her interviews a priority?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzhfop	2019-06-11 20:04:25		WIBTA if I broke a four year friendship over a misunderstanding?	"For a long time, my mom told me to not tell anyone about how my dad was abusive. She said that “it wasn’t anyone’s business what goes on in my family.” Well, after years of keeping this to myself, the first person I told about it was my best friend of four years. I also told her that this was one of the main reasons I don’t get into relationship anymore, because she’s always asking me about it so I thought I would clarify that I’m not emotionally ready for anything. 

At first, everything seemed fine. Then slowly, she started treating me more and more like a charity project. She first tried to set me up with this guy who I really didn’t know that well, which I was ok with because I thought she was just trying to help. And then she tried setting me up with her ex boyfriend which was really awkward because I didn’t know and I didn’t want to go out with him. Then she tried to set me up with my CHURCH leader which was the weirdest thing of all because he’s way older than me and almost like a father/brother to me. 

And now today for the first time I met her brother. We’re on a trip together and we’re staying with my cousins right now. This entire time she’s been talking to my cousins and she’s become great friends with them, to the point that they call her our cousin too. She asks them about their jobs all the time and I’m happy that they’re getting along. So when I meet her brother, I also ask him about his job, but I talk to him about 1/5 of the amount that she talks to my cousins. Like he asked me where I was going to college and then later I was like “[my friend] told me you got a scholarship to your college” and just basic stuff like that. My friend had asked my cousins all about their work and I didn’t even ask him about his. We just met up for breakfast, and that’s it. So like 5 mins after he leaves my friend is like “this is kind of frustrating, and it’s not my brother’s fault, but don’t get a crush on him” and I was like whAT??? Some guy who’s 10 years older than me who’s looking to get married right now who I just met today?? And so I told her that I was just being nice and that I barely talked to him, and she was like “maybe it’s just my overprotective side but I got the vibes from you and I don’t want you to steal him from me”. She actually said “steal him from me.” I’m not tryina steal her brother, but it’s ok for her to get really close to my cousins? I don’t even know if I want to be friends with her anymore. Idk if it’s a bit petty to break our friendship over this."	Not the A-hole	1	0
bzhet8	2019-06-11 20:02:25		WIBTA for refusing to visit my ailing grandparents?	"I live on the East Coast while the majority of my family lives in a very rural part of the Midwest. I plan on visiting my brother and parents there this summer, and my father wants me to also visit his parents. My grandfather on that side has heart failure, diabetes, and is on dialysis multiple times a week. He has expressed that he wants to stop dialysis and die soon. My grandmother isn’t off as badly, but she is also in her eighties.

The thing is - they were not great to me as a kid. They frequently separated me from my older brothers for activities as a kid (I’m female), and made it clear they had a preference for perfect little angel boy children. Meanwhile, if any conflict occurred between my brothers and I, they would say things to me like “Why do you mess everything up?” Or “why do you always ruin things?” Another example is that I once lost a toy car under the oven while playing. I went to retrieve it, but my grandmother pushed me aside and said that I “can’t do anything right” and that I’m “stupid.” She would also whisper under her breath all the time around me, and if I asked what she was saying, she would say “nothing.” 

This was pretty much my whole childhood experience of my grandparents. While it was not overtly abusive, their behavior caused a lot of self esteem issues as well as internalized misogyny issues that I had to work out (perceiving females, my own sex, as the “worse” sex). Also, with age, they’ve begun to express a lot of negative political views (generally wrapped up in explicit racism) that I don’t remember being present before, but which are very off-putting.

So, I want to explain my reasons for not wanting to visit them, even though it might be one of my last chances to do so. I know this will probably upset my dad - but I really feel like I have only bad memories or sentiments related to these grandparents, and that any attempt to interact with them in the context of them passing on soon will be very forced and uncomfortable.

I’d really appreciate any outside views on this or views from other people in similar situations. WIBTA for refusing to visit my dad’s parents even though they may be passing on soon?"		1	0

He is in the process of divorce. In the distance he saw how he embraced her. She came home and told me everything, she described the woman to me, she said that she was short and brown. Then she said that she had realized that someone is always changed by a much worse person. I asked her if there really could be someone worse than my grandmother for him (she is really,really bad) to what my mom said: at least she's white. I'm brown, so it hurt. I told her that that did not mean that my grandmother was better, and that then my brother was much better than me. I went to my room and from the outside she asked me for forgiveness and said that I should not feel bad, that she said it because she was angry. Then she left and cried a little. I know it hurts her parents get divorced and I was supporting her until she said that. but I can not pretend that nothing happened when she said clearly that she thinks that brown people are inferior to white people. and my family has said things like that before. We are Mexicans, so it does not make sense, but still believe that skin color represents the value of a person. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her even though she's suffering? what should I do?

bzh94h	2019-06-11 19:49:28	FullStandard	AITA for not supporting a former friend?	"Throwaway because some of my friends know my Reddit name. Also, English isn't my first language, so please be kind.

A few years ago, i joined a club and became pretty good friends with a member of it. At the club everyone can choose something similar to a godfather at the beginning and I chose her. We also founded a second club with some friends. At the first club was a guy I really don't like, and he became her boyfriend around half a year ago. Ever since then the friendship between us went really cold. Normally whenever she and her boyfriend now attend a club meeting, they stay for the official part and as soon as it's over they just talk with each other and regularely disappear for a couple of hours because they ""have to talk"". This is also bothering the other members, so it isn't just me not liking him.

Even though I don't like her boyfriend I tried to stay in contact with her, but it didn't work. I asked her several times if she wants to go out for a coffee (we did this around twice a week in the past) and she always had an excuse. This were things like having an important exam in three weeks. At this point I have to add that around a year ago she complained about an other friend because she asked if he has time for a coffee and he said that he has an exam in around a week. Her point back then was literally ""if he had been interested in meeting, he would have found some time. It's still more than a week"". She agreed just once to meet for a coffee  with me and then brought her boyfriend with her (she knows that I don't like him) so I left after a short time.

Also, a few days ago she and I attended a club meeting (her boyfriend wasn't there) and she brought an other friend I know as well and so we talked.  And because she wanted to keep the conversation running she asked about an exam I had more than half a year ago because it was the latest thing she knew about my life.

Today she asked me if i can help her at the club we founded together. She is searching for people for the committee (she's the chairwoman) and asked if I'm in again. I told her no because I'm not as interested in it as I was when we founded it and I wouldn't do a good job.

I didn't lie about the fact that I'm not as interested in working there than I was the last time, but I also rejected it because I don't feel of her as a friend any more and one of the principles in the club is friendship. But now I feel guilty because I know we are short of members which can join the committee and she was relying that I'll say yes because I always did in the past.

So, AITA for turning her request (and kind of the friendship) down?

bzh8dx	2019-06-11 19:47:43	fuckthisschool12345	AITA for not wanting to be involved in my half brothers lives?	"My family has always been somewhat dysfunctional and my parents have always had problems for as long as I could remember. A specific period would be when I was age 14-16 where things were really getting bad. Constant fighting and arguing to the point where my father went to a family reunion on the other side of the country and ended up not coming back for a good year. Had me looking stupid in front of the my relatives when they asked me when my dad was coming back and also when I'd call him asking when he was gonna come back because the issues me and my mother had been getting worse because she was taking her anger out on me. There would be times when I'd call him to just to tell him what she was doing and he'd basically call me a burden.

One day my brother was at the store and ran into one of my father's friends who then asked him if he was happy about getting twin brothers. My brother then told my mother who then called my father and he completely denied the whole thing until like months later when he told only me and my sister and had us swear we wouldnt tell our mother. Horrible position to put a child in, huh? The way my mother found out was a couple of months later when the side chick decided to call my mother while she was grieving over my grandfather who got into a horrible accident and was on life support. This made things even worse.

&#x200B;

I guess my qualms would mostly have to do with my father. Before he left to the other side of the country he'd always ask my sister and I if we cared if he had more children. I thought nothing of it but now that I think about it, this was most likely planned. The outcome of his actions just caused unnecessary problems and I cant help but think of that whenever I think about my half brothers. I've never met them and I dont know if I want to. I would never treat them badly but I just dont want to be involved. Its just a permanent reminder of that time of my life when my father decided that abandoning his legitimate kids was okay."

bzh847	2019-06-11 19:47:05	Altarlex	AITA for telling my step mother off?	"Ok so, my step mother is a real character. She has tattoos everywhere, piercings, and is a bit large. She has always been insecure about her weight and that's awful, but she has the nerve to call my sister and I ugly for being too skinny.  She's been in my life for about ten years (mother passed when I was younger) and has taken to using my mother to get my sister and I to do things. She says things like ""your mother would want you to be responsible and clean this"" or ""she would want you to be a lady and wear this"" it worked when I was younger, and after a decade, I was tired of her childish attitude. She lies about me to my father, criticizes me when I wear crop tops, walks around the house commenting on my behaviour and then proceeds to act like I don't exist in the house until she finds something else I messed up. Well, a year or so ago, her mother passed away. She wasn't even that upset (at least on the outside. I imagine it still hurt on the inside) and I was given strict instructions to say nothing to her(we haven't spoken outside of her comments in about five years) well, of course I feel bad and I want to say something,  but I don't want to cause a scene. Fast forward  year later and she is at it again. I'm in the kitchen cooking myself some dinner, and I hwar her raise her voice from the living room and put on that whiny, judgmental tone. She says to her son""I'm tired of waiting for everyone in this house. Always acting like the victim. Pretending they own it and can just do whatever they want for however long they want."" I am done with this. I step out of the kitchen and meet her cold, annoyed eyes. I give her my sweetest smile and ask her ""Honey, would your mother want you to be such a condescending bitch? Because guess what? I'm right here, if you have something to say, say it to me. Not your son, or my dad."" She LOST it. Screaming about how could I be so horrible as to use her dead mother against her (the irony is strong with this one) she said I was a horrible, ugly, lazy child. I told her she was not allowed to make me feel like I am nothing. I am not worth a million dollars but I am worth something and she doesn't get to make me feel otherwise. I understand it's hard to come into a family after a loss, and I know she may have felt pressure to live up to my mother. But we'd told her so many times, our mom is our mom,  don't replace her just be yourself. So AITA here?

bzh5k3	2019-06-11 19:41:13	nerandr321	AITA for not spending $50 to buy the clothes my mom wanted?	"Some background: 

I am a M 20, currently in college, now spending my summer. I live at home, with my parents (expected to really. I live in an Asian household (brown)). I don't have a job, nor have I held one for a while, to focus on college. Whatever money I have in my bank account, I get through the school, and it's not much. I have around $6k saved up, which I consider my emergency fund that I dip into for whatever, train fare, food, etc.

There are...tensions in my family so to speak. I don't get along with my dad too well, as he tries to force everything on me. I know it sounds entitled, probably is since I'm living on his generosity, but when I say force I mean there is no room for me to say anything. He is always right, and I can't hold an opinion, and if I do, it's disregarded or made fun of down the line. I guess he would count as a narcissist parent :/ . It's either listen to him 100% or he gets super red faced angry, and I either have to listen or choose to leave the house.

Because of that I think I may end up getting kicked out at one point or another, so I've been saving my money to create an emergency fund of around $6k+. Not even enough to addord rent for a year. 

I'm super hesitant to spend large amounts of money $50+ even for myself, unless it's important. 

Cue today. My mom doesn't really work.  If I have to be honest, I think she's bitter at her life and there are tensions between her and my dad. I feel bad for her, 100%.

She gets spending money from my dad.
Today she didn't have much on her because she left the house after having an argument with my dad. 

She asked me twice, if I would pay for her clothes. The first time I thought she was joking, but I guess not.

I hesitated for a moment too long, and she got upset. No tantrum, just upset. She called me stingy, and that I'd never buy anything for her. 

I don't know how to feel really. The rational side of me is saying $50 is too much for someone who lives off of his meager emergency fund and doesn't have any job or anything. Heck I rarely spend upwards of $25 on much, even when outside getting food with friends.

But, the emotional side of me is ashamed. She doesn't work, and has no income of her own (she's looking for a job now actually). 

I told her that I don't have a job, that I consider it an emergency fund of sorts. I even mentioned the getting kicked out part. Her reaction wasn't any different. She was disappointed that I'd ever ""leave them"". I told her I wouldn't mind paying for her once I got a steadier source of income. Still nothing.

bzh4a3	2019-06-11 19:38:11	throwaway_9527	AITA for finding my landlord annoying?	"I'm an exchange student in Europe flatsharing for 1 year, 2 bathrooms, shared kitchen and bathroom, other room is airbnb with a new roommate every 2 months. Never signed any contract, landlord works out of the country.

When I first arrived I was shocked, flat looks very different from the pictures. It is much older, cracks everywhere on the floor. I already paid the first month so I sucked it up and said nothing. Got a message from landlord, a block of text about cleanliness in the common areas.

3 days later new roommate moved in, I didn't know until I came home. That night, I received a barrage of complaints from the landlord and his friend (lets call her S), saying that the flat was very dirty. S helps the landlord check in new roommates, and took pictures of the flat for him (kitchen and bathroom). I had no idea, it literally looks the same as when I moved in.

S regularly comes to the flat unannounced once every 2 weeks to clean the common areas. She sends pictures to the landlord, after which he sends me long messages of what should have been cleaned. There is ALWAYS something I miss, no matter what I do.

Now I'm not the tidiest of all, but I think I'm not too messy, the kitchen gets dirty from normal use. Landlord complains about small oil stains on the wall next to the stove (I can't even see them), the skillet was left on the stove (I must put it back in the cupboard after use), pasta box was on the table, 2 dirty dishes in the sink (once per week I'm in a hurry and leave them there until I come home at night), full trash bin (S came to the flat right when it is the fullest), the bathroom door was closed, etc.

I used to always say sorry and try harder, but there always seem to be more. He says I must keep everything clean because he ""doesn't want to get any more bad reviews"".

I only feel safe in my bedroom, no random strangers here.

In Christmas the landlord came to live for a month, everyday I got talked to. Once he told me I need to shower quicker (I like to take 20 min shower to relax, shave, remove makeup), he says showers must be 5 min max, gas is expensive and I need to be considerate.

One night there is no hot water, I asked him the next day, he said ""oh sorry I forgot to tell you I'm replacing the gas box"". He refused to hire a worker and got his friend to do it. I had no hot water in the middle of freezing December for 1 week.

Last time S came, I left dirty dishes in the sink. My phone blew up the next day, with calls and messages saying how dirty I was and he had to pay S more because of the mess. I said, what about you tell me when she comes so I can clean in advance? He said: it's not about money, you are supposed to clean the kitchen everytime you use it.

Today I got a talking to again. I'm really tired of this. I'm not paid to be a live-in cleaner. I'm not trashing the place, it is just normal use of the flat.

Since he is so afraid of bad reviews, AITA if I leave a bad review?

bzh30h	2019-06-11 19:35:16		AITA: For storming off when I’m mad or upset at a friend?	"I have this one friend named Cat she's 30 I'm 22. We met through mutual friends. She always has drama at work and never likes her boss. She changes jobs every year. She sometimes gets in arguments with her roommates where she ends up crying because they aren't as clean by her standards. Sometimes I make plans with her to go hiking on the weekend.

We’ll make plans for one then she won't text me the day of until five saying ”sorry I slept in” she's done it about three times to me. She just doesn't set the alarm because ”she knows she’ll wake up.” I always seem to be doing only what she wants to do. We went to a restaurant I loved, and she said we could never go back because they took the pasta she likes off the menu.

She makes comments about the way I look and my personality. I told her I was harassed and bullied so severely in high school. She has made comments about how my hair looks fake and overprocessed. I go to school and sometimes work as a freelancer. She's made comments to me sometimes when we hang out like ”SOME OF US have work in the morning”

She says I ask too many questions because usually when I see my friends, I want to know what's going on in their lives. She doesn't ask many about me. I've gotten upset about her questions comments, but a mutual friend who I used to date says ”she probably thinks you ask too many questions or talk too much because she never stops talking about herself.” she's made comments like ”you either say nothing or express too much Love you though.”


I sometimes binge drink when I'm stressed. I don't drink everyday or most weekends. I've been trying to cut drinking out of my life because I don't want to become a problem drinker. I see a therapist two times a week and always talk to my family about it.She's made comments about my drinking like ”oh my God your out of control and thank God your not drinking this weekend.” she also tries to baby me in front of people and take away my drink even if I'm having one beer. She smokes weed every single day.



When I ask her to do stuff, I love like going to the movies, she always says no and makes passive aggressive comments about how I should stop asking her about it. I've gone to six different concerts she likes even though I've never listened to those bands to be supportive. In the last couple of months, I've become silent and walked out when she's made passive aggressive comments because I don't want to go off and say mean things to a friend, so I storm off and go home.



She recently made a group chat sharing an old photo of my friends and me. I'm blackout drunk in the photo, and it's very embarrassing. I texted her to not post shit like that. She said she didn't think anything of it before she posted because it was a nice picture. I just said whatever. I hadn't talked to her in a couple of weeks, and she texts me about how our relationship didn't stay healthy, and she doesn't want to stay friends anymore.

bzh26z	2019-06-11 19:33:19	GladDistribution7	AITA for not cancelling plans to attend a family event?	"About a month ago, I agreed to help my best friend move. He's getting a divorce, and while he had movers coming to get the furniture, he asked for help with the Uhaul and boxes and small stuff. He helped us move a year ago, and I helped him move a couple years ago too. So asking for help moving is not new between us.

He told me the move date. I checked with my wife. She said there was a festival that afternoon she wanted to attend. So I told my friend I could help in the morning but I needed to be back home in the afternoon.

Fast forward a few weeks. A week or 10 days before the move date. We get an invitation in the mail for my wife's cousin's kid's 1st birthday party. It's the same day as the move (party in the late morning/early afternoon). I tell my wife I can't make it. I already told my friend I'd help him move that day. There's no way I can be done in time to make the party, and even if I could, I'd be dirty and sweaty from moving.

Wife says I should cancel on my friend because family events are more important and we should all go together.

I said I'm not cancelling on my best friend and leaving him in a lurch. If we had known about the party in advance, I wouldn't have agreed to help my friend that morning. But we didn't know. And when I made plans to help, we had no conflicts. Now the Uhaul is booked and the move date is firm.

The day came and went. I helped my friend move. Wife went to the party alone with our son. We both came home and we went to the festival in the afternoon as planned.

Wife says I'm an asshole for not going to the party and making her go alone. I say I would have been a bigger asshole to blow off my best friend when those plans had been made weeks before.

I asked him if it was true and he said it was. But it’s okay because he’s really confident in his pull-out game.

Anyway, they all get in my car before I can stop them so I was like whatever, I’ll just take them home. But as we set off, one of them gets my umbrella out from underneath the front passenger seat and starts putting it up and down.

"I happen to have a large house that I bought from my parents, and for the past 6-7 years or so we have this summer tradition of bringing over kids and extended family for a few weeks and catching up over summer.

I've been married for a couple of years so this is the 2nd time that my sister-in-law is spending a few weeks with us (us = my wife, my brother and his family, my mom, and her mom).

I've noticed several things that concern me and the SIL has been, let's say, very provocative with her dressing style. Lounging around in the common areas without a bra, spending inordinate amounts of time in just a bikini, even wanting to sunbathe topless whenever she can. 

I'm not comfortable with this, and I have two nephews of almost teenage age. I think this is highly inappropriate behavior for a 20-year old. My wife thinks we should let her be because that's in her nature and she means well. I seem to disagree and told her a couple of times to cover up and maybe wear something more than just bikini bottoms.

She doesn't seem to be listening to me, and being my place, I want to put my foot down for the next couple of weeks. And even get my wife on board. But she seems to disagree. AITA here?"	No A-holes here	1	0
bzgyv5	2019-06-11 19:25:40		AITA for leaving my niece's graduation when I realized she'd invited my shithead father?	"Tried to post this yesterday but apparently it was too long so I'll try to be more brief.

This happened last year but I am still dealing with the fallout and haven't spoken to my niece and her family since the incident.

Last year my nice invited me to her high school graduation and when I arrived at her home, I ran into my father who had I not seen for 3 years prior. No one had bothered to tell me he had been invited and I left in shock and dismay. I did not cause a scene, I simply bolted when I saw him. About an hour later, I texted one of my nieces to ask why no one had bothered to tell me he was coming and she claimed she did not know. Well, clearly someone invited him.

My backstory with my father is complicated to say the least. He was a class A asshole my entire life. Left my mom pregnant with me and one with a 2 year old to care for (my brother and father of my nieces). Told my mom to abort me and that he would never have anything to do with me if I were to be born. Treated me like I was invisible and worthless every time I was forced to see him growing up. Gave my mom half the amount of child support for me that he gave to my brother.  Told his whole extended family that I was not his kid and made up an elaborate lie about who my real father is (unfortunately it's just not true and this douche is my dad), causing them to treat me like a second class citizen my whole life.

As an adult, I have seen him 3 times in the last 20 years. None of these times was pleasant. In 2015, I called to let him know my mom had died and he proceeded to say horrible things about her and then repeat his same old lie about me not being his kid. In a text, I later told him off with a lifetime's worth of built up resentment. He never acknowledged a word I said and then sent me some bullshit group text that he sent various other people about wishing me a ""blessed"" holiday season because he's a ""Christian"". LOL

None of this is a secret in my family and my nieces and both their parents are all well aware of all of this history. The next day after the graduation, I texted my niece who had graduated and simply asked her to let me know if she planned to invite him to future events because it was really upsetting for me to have to be around him. She got super defensive and angry and told me I was making \*\*her\*\* day about myself and that she would rather I not come at all if I was going to cause ""drama"".

I spent all holidays alone in 2018 as a result. These people are the only family I have left and not one of them ever reached out to apologize to me or even just to see how I am.

I feel like I was making a reasonable request here. I didn't tell her not to invite him. I simply asked for her to let me know if he was going to be invited so that I could make the choice not to attend if I wanted to. When I told this story to a ""friend"" of mine, she agreed that I was making my niece's day about myself and shouldn't have said anything at all.

bzgym7	2019-06-11 19:25:11		AITA for not wanting to interact with his family?	"A few months ago, my bf and I drove across the country to move into a room in his sister and brother-in-law's new home. I know the rest of his family well and I fit in with them. I only met this couple a few times prior, and they seemed ok. I went into this situation optimistically, assuming it would be fun to see a new part of the country and that we would all get along. We're paying rent and it's about average for the area, so, not a deal or anything. We also all talked about helping fix the house up together once we got there.

So we drove almcross the country, finally got here and....it sucks. The house is in disrepair and needs a lot of work. Nbd and not their fault; they got here just before us. My boyfriend and I bought all the paint and supplies and did the work of painting our room and bathroom. However, we both work full-time. His relatives don't- they're pretty wealthy and only work odd weekends. They do have a 1-year-old, which I know is a full time job, but I just mean that they aren't on parental leave or anything. Anyway, we haven't helped out much with any other house stuff, because we're both busy and paying rent.

The real discomfort for me comes from living with them. There were a few weird passive aggressive things in the beginning that made us both feel uneasy. But we're both conflict avoidant and I can tell my boyfriend is intimidated by them.  They have a habit of saying condescending things, maybe accidentally, but often. They're pretty delusional about their own wealth and other people's lives. It's hard to listen to a couple of people my age complain about the countertops in their new 750k home when I get home from long shifts. They do occasionally reach out and try to make conversation, but they seem to only listen to respond. I can see their eyes glaze over when I say anything about myself and I'm often met with some snarky comeback. Like, talking to then is some kind of competition to be hilarious. I just don't find it fun or funny-  it's exhausting to me, really, because I'm lonely out here, and the conversation feels like an odd game.

The last straw is that they recently decided to move their baby's room into the room next to ours, his crib up against our wall. I start a new job this week and his screaming has already woken me up. The house has no soundproofing because they cut out the popcorn insulation for aesthetic reasons. When my bf mentioned it his sister said our closet should block the sound. Uh...no. I feel depressed and resentful. I'm mad at myself for coming out here blindly. I just stay in my room and barely speak to them when I do have to interact. I refuse to help fix up other parts of the house, even when my boyfriend does.  It's creating tension between us, which I really do not want, but he won't say anything to them and just sort of half-agrees when I say I want us to move out and get our own place. It's gotten to the point where ive threatened to leave alone, but neither of us really wants that. Should I be trying harder?"	Not enough info	1	0

She has this habit of venting to me about how difficult things are for her, or about how she just 'needs a break' from work, cant get anything done, etc.. 
It's hard for me to care anymore because I do a significantly more difficult job, and work far more hours than she does, get far less help than she does, and I support myself entirely AND we have the exact same mental health diagnosis (for which she blames her lack of motivation and 'inability' to hold down any other job.)

But the others then had the idea to get something to drink (we're all underage) and so they got some alcohol for us and we all left the restaurant. We went to a local park, sat down and they all drank something. Kate too & she always gets drunk pretty fast. 

I was uncomfortable in the situation, because I don't like being around a lot people, especially not drunk people. So maybe half an Hour to an Hour later we changed locations and went into a party basement from some friends of one guy at the group. 

At this point I left, because I didn't knew those people and they were about to get drunk, which kinda scared me. So I left, while Kate was already drunk and couldn't really walk straight anymore.

My sister went to Italy for graduation, my other sister got a nose job, both of which are obviously VERY expensive.  I wanted a $950 gaming PC and they spent weeks trying to get me to buy some $700 hot garbage, I almost just accepted it but I asked if I could throw in the rest of the money to get the better one and they said yes.  So both of my sisters got $3000+ presents and didn’t pay a dime, I wanted a $950 present and they’re making me throw in money. 

I’m really low maintenance and don’t really care for material shit, so I could go on about just how much more they have spent on my sisters than me at this point, it’s definitely 5 figures.

"A little background- I (20M) recently got home from college, and am living at home for the summer while I commute to work in a nearby city. I have to leave the house at 6:30 AM, and I don't get back until around 8:30 in the evening. During this school year, I was especially busy with school and work, and let myself put on a bit of extra weight, which I have been hoping to shed over the course of the summer so I can be healthier and move down some weight classes for boxing in the fall. So, I've been trying to work out more and more so, because of my long working/commuting hours making it tough to get to the gym enough, eat cleaner.

&#x200B;

Naturally since I've been home, my Mom has been really excited to have me back, and has pre-prepared a lot of my favorite foods for me to eat over the next couple of months. I'm super grateful and would love to eat it all, but it's all really carb and fat filled stuff, lasagna, meatballs, etc. Basically, I want to tell my mom that I can't eat like that if I'm going to keep trying to improve my health but all of the food is already made, and I would hate nothing more than to hurt my Mom's feelings. Stuff like this has happened in the past, and she has been really disappointed and said that she feels like I don't appreciate her or what she does, although this is far from the case. I'm just trying to look out for my health going forward, especially since I got somewhat troubling medical news this week which could be directly helped by a better diet.

I know I have to get a job, and I've been applying everyday and going to interviews to get myself a job. 

I do not want to devote every single day to finding a job, I have friends and hobbies I want to do Aswell. I've wanted to watch E3 conferences and in 2 weeks I wanted to watch some SGDQ. Everytime I bring these up to my SO, she gets pissed and annoyed saying I shouldn't give a shit about anything but getting a job.

bzgscx	2019-06-11 19:10:58		AITA for buying a sizable portion of my school's graduation tickets?	"My high school every year hosts graduation where students can buy additional tickets beyond the two given to each student graduating where there is a set amount of about 200. My family is visiting internationally for my graduation specifically, and as a result I bought 12 tickets as I have a large family and they all came for one specific purpose. Last time for my brothers graduation, he didn't buy enough and they were hurt as they came for 1 reason so it was kinda a dick move and so I had to buy such amount.

&#x200B;

Tickets ended up getting sold out by the third day of sale morning, and now because a lot of students who are graduating didn't buy their tickets in time are now upset for obvious reasons and my friends are paging me for going and buying such amount of tickets. This isn't helped as other people have bought extra tickets and are trying to resell it for ridiculous amounts.

&#x200B;

Summarized:

&#x200B;

My point for buying so much is that I have a big family visiting internationally bc our families are close, I went early on the first day and bought my tickets so I wouldn't have to worry about them selling out before (ended up being first to buy as well), and if other students don't like it they were just being lazy and should've came in early seeing as it was available for basically 3 days. 

&#x200B;

Students were also given an email reminder the day before they were on sale, so it wasn't like they weren't given adequate time to get the money prepared. I see the point of them as they too have families, but if they wanted the tickets they should've came early like I did so they can also see their families come to their graduations."

"A few weeks ago, husband and I had plans to meet his friend (Best man from our wedding) and his GF at a bar at a set time. Husband and I got there a few minutes early, he ordered a drink and I ordered a snack (currently pregnant). By 20 minutes after the agreed upon wait time, we hadn't heard from Friend/GF. Friend/GF are notoriously late to hangouts, but usually only 10-15 minutes. The four of us are in a group chat together and between Husband and I, we send about 4 messages to them in the group chat. We get no answer and husband decides to go ahead and have another drink, assuming that they are on their way.   


By 40 minutes past agreed meet time, we haven't heard anything from Friend/GF and our messages haven't been read or answered. Husband and I tab out and leave the bar. At 50 minutes past the meet time, on our drive home, we receive a message in the group chat from GF saying sorry, they are on their way to the bar. I'm driving, but husband tells them that we had left. Friend responds that he's sorry that they made us wait, but that they were still going to the bar if we wanted to meet them. Husband declines, says have fun, I point out that we had waited over 40 minutes and hadn't been answered. Friend says they had left both of their phones in the car while talking to his parents, and that we should have told them that we were going to leave. Husband said that they could have told us they were going to be late. GF reiterates that we should have told them that we were going to leave, and the group chat just sort of dropped off.   


We didn't really talk much to friend/GF in the next couple weeks because they went on a trip to Disneyworld, and husband was of the opinion that they should reach out to us. 2 weeks ago, husband accidentally sent a link in our group chat with Friend/GF, that was intended for another group chat. I apologized saying the link was intended for a different chat. Friend immediately left the group. I asked GF why Friend left the group chat and she said maybe Husband should talk to friend. Husband jokes ""was he upset that he was late to -Bar-?"" GF responds that Husband should talk to Friend about it. Husband says if Friend is upset, then Friend should talk about what he's upset about. GF left the group chat. 

&#x200B;

We haven't talked to them since, and I'm wondering if we are in the wrong here? Friend was the best man at our wedding, and we as couples were pretty decent friends/saw each other almost every week before all of this.

I put them on a TO for 4 years, disinvited them to my wedding (2010) and only in 2014 did I start letting them back in on MY terms. 

&#x200B;

On Friday, my non verbal/ASD/severely disabled son eloped from his school. I, as his mother, was handling it the best way I could at the time. My parents, who live 1.5 hours away, were PISSED at how I handled the matter. They threatened to come down to my sons school and get him, since I ""cared more about my job than my son"". The ONLY reason I knew about this elopment was because my son's aide broke protocol and told me before the principal did. I wanted to wait, since I knew my son was safe, and see how long it took for the school to call me. 

&#x200B;

My parents had to then find out, they are NOT on any list for pick up/emergency or non. And then it came up, they are NOT in my will and will not get my son if both my husband and I died.

AITA here? They say its ""blood"" but I hate that saying. They were verbally/emotionally/mentally abusive growing up and I do NOT let them have my son because, well duh.

It was supposed to be fun and liberating and something I could cross off my bucket list. It also was supposed to fix my (totally crooked) under cut. 

&#x200B;

When I finally came home, my Dad asks me how it went. I told him it was shorter than I wanted, but it would grow out fast enough. Once he finally got a good look at it, he kept calling me a cancer patient, and asking how chemo was going. He also told me it was cut uneven, which I think he was serious about, but I can't get it anymore even, even with help from friends.

&#x200B;

That all really hurt. For as long as I can remember my Dad has been the more critical parent about my appearance. Normally, he is really nice about how I look.  But when I look bad, especially when I know I look bad, he's not afraid to tell me I look bad. We had a really long heart to heart about this a few years ago right after I graduated high school, and since he's been better (Not perfect, but better), and that's all I can ask for. 

&#x200B;

Well, after five minutes of making fun of me, and within ten minutes of me being home, I'm in tears. (Hormonal Birth Control makes you a fucking mess.) He didn't ask why I was upset yet, and just said ""Come on, you know it's okay and you know there is nothing you could ever do to make me love you any less."" And I nodded. He asked why I was crying, and I said, ""I'm not asking you to lie to me and say it looks good. I know it doesn't. I just hoped you'd be supportive.""  And he stared at me for a little bit. He finally said, ""I don't think it's fair of you to say I'm unsupportive. I have always supported you in everything you do."" 

&#x200B;

He is right. I've always been allowed to dye my hair, cut it any way I want, go into any occupation I like, get pierced or tattooed, do any extra curriculars/sports, whatever it was he just wanted me to be happy. But, just because I'm happy doesn't mean I don't get his opinion on why it isn't the best thing to do with my time or something he is interested in. Sometimes, these opinions are enlightening, sometimes these things sound  like jokes that tear you down. 

&#x200B;

I nodded again and didn't say anything. He said, ""Oh great. Now I'm the bad guy."" After not answering that because I'm still just crying, he decided to leave. 

&#x200B;

He thinks I'm a jerk for not only not learning to take a joke and making him the only bad guy because of it. I think he's a jerk because I feel like a lot of things that are important to me he makes jokes or assumptions about me that, while they don't make him love me any less they still hurt me. Who's the asshole here? I know my post was written by me, so I probably made him sound like the bad guy, but I really do feel guilty for saying he's unsupportive, because I know that seriously hurt his feelings because he has always prided himself on how supportive he is of my brothers and I."

So the morning of the party comes and we are getting picked up at noon. I texted K around 10:30 and reminded her she needed to be ready and she said ""I had a family emergency and had to go back to [hometown abt 2 hours away] so I'm not coming."" 

I said ok and I hope she's okay, and she didn't respond to that. Fine. And then I went to our local mall to get the friend a birthday gift, and I see K in a clothing store with her sister. It's now obvious that she lied to get out of the party. I ignored her and walked by, not looking at her. 

I told my friends what she told me and that I saw her, and they said I should've confronted her in the store. I agree with them but I didn't have any time to talk and didn't feel like having a confrontation in that moment.

For the draft last year, the date and time was set (as the years have gone on, live drafts have become logistically impossible) via group text. Apparently, *on the day of the draft* the time was moved up two hours but that was only communicated via WeChat. I don't WeChat and never have. So, I was pretty pissed off when I entered the draft only to see it was done and my team was autodrafted in an auction league.

I'm a commissioner in another league and the thought of doing something as big as changing the draft time without communicating to everybody is pretty unthinkable. But I think it was an honest mistake because I'm the only one without WeChat. But what really stuck in my craw was that *nobody* bothered to text me at any point during the draft with a ""Hey dude, are you going to join the draft?"" I was completely in the dark. 

However, I've talked to people outside the league and they said I'd be the asshole for leaving because I still came in 3rd (pat myself on the back there) and there would be no viable replacement, dropping the league to an odd number. But I still want to stand on my initial anger and just walk away from this league. WIBTA and a petty piece of shit if I did?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bzglgj	2019-06-11 18:55:45	pikaghee92	WIBTA if I expose my brother fake marriage	"TDLR: Brother lied to several about his recent union. People spent bank for his wedding. He is still married to his second wife. 

So like the title states, my brother had a wedding this past week that's not legally a union that everyone went crazy for. I unfortunately couldn't make it because they got married so fast and my husband and I just moved.

My brother is a pastor and people worship the ground he walks on. He is the favorite amongst some family because of his title. But in reality those same people that praise him come to me hurt because he can be the rudest and coldest dude ever. I experience that also, I always tried to look up to him, but he pushed me away and didn't even show up to my wedding because of church. 

 Like I don't want to judge since I'm imperfect too. A couple of months ago, my brother who was already married once and recently divorced starting seeing another girl. He hid her from Facebook and he confessed to my mom that he got drunk, married her, and got her pregnant twice. But my brother happily showed my mom the old marriage certificate and never admitted to being drunk when they married. This ""drunk stuff"" only came out when it stopped him from getting a certificate for the new girl. Only my mom knew they were married at the time. 

Of course I was confused because the last girl was dropped faster than hot potatoes, but he was saying this new girl is the one for him. Everyone loved her because she was nice and ""pretty and lightskin"" according to my grandma. I never had an issue and just want my brother happy, but something didn't seem right. He popped the question within a few months of the last girl and they set the wedding date for a month. My brother told my mom that he tried to get the marriage certificate but he was still married to the last girl. And clarification, my mom share these things with me because she knows I won't tell other people in the family. 

My mom told him to push it back (the wedding) and tell his current fiance. He kept the wedding date and told the fiance. He went to court and my mom and I assumed everything was fine. So majority put up money for this wedding and paid for so much. My grandma even worked over so she could give them money for their new union. 

While my mom was house sitting she saw a form with a divorce hearing date for his real current wife for July. My mom told me and I was hurt. All of these people spent bank on what they thought was a real union.

Also, my brother ""ex-wife"" showed up to the wedding and they escorted her out.

I'm more hurt because they lied to people about their situation and got so much money for a union they thought was real. I know all this dirt but I don't wanna share it with family because then I will feel terribly, but I'm tired of my brother taking advantage of people and not getting consequences.

She is also getting married the same weekend, on Sunday. Both of these events are in Colorado. It was nice of her to plan it like this, so people wanting to attend both events only have to travel once. 

 I live in California, where my partner and I, both graduate students,  who rarely get time off, only make a combined 50k a year. Traveling to Colorado is expensive for us. Since we are making the trip for her wedding, we want to spend Thursday and Friday in Rocky Mountain National Park rock climbing, because that is our passion, and we rarely get to travel out of state. I plan to spend Friday night at her bachelorette party, and all day Saturday and Sunday doing family/wedding stuff. 

&#x200B;

She is pissed that I will be in Colorado Thursday and not at her graduation. Here are my reasons for not going:

1. She didn't attend my college graduation, because she had military commitments, so I do not feel obligated to attend hers. 
2. Traveling out of state is expensive for us, and, it is very hard to get any time off as a PhD student. So I just want to take the opportunity and enjoy some of the best rock climbing in the country. 
3. Friday night-Sunday night all our time will be spent doing wedding things. I feel like I am giving her so much of my time already, to ask us to also spend all day Thursday (the graduation is like 11-4) at a graduation seems selfish of her. 
4. Donald Trump or Mike Pence will be speaking. I know this is petty, but I genuinely don't want to sit through that. 

 

TLDR; my sister is graduating and getting married same weekend, I only want to attend wedding, and go rock climbing on day of graduation."		1	0

bzgghk	2019-06-11 18:44:33		WIBTA if I told my brother I’m upset with him for going after another job after he started working where I work?	"That title is sloppy, sorry. I’m going to try to keep this short bc I don’t feel like typing a fucking book. 


I want to start off by saying that if my brother did not work for me, but worked at some other job, and got the opportunity to make more money I would tell him to take the new job if it didn’t get in the way of his future aspirations. I actually still feel that if he gets this job then good for him. I don’t necessarily want him to stay for any other reason other than he said he’d work the summer and I counted on that. It would be the same with any employee. If he leaves, I’ll be working 7 days a week doing the job of two people on some of those days. I have not told him this bc I’m not going to guilt the kid but I’m obviously upset about it. The owners will find help eventually but it’s a crapshoot of whether or not it’ll be competent help. I’ve worked with more shitty people in the last 7 years than good. It was it is. I’m good at my job. I can do it by myself if I have to but it’s exhausting. The other two people that work with me are part time. 

Basically I am the manager of a family business. My (23F) younger brother (18M) has worked a summer with me in the past. When this summer rolled around he said he’d like to work again and I got him back on for the summer. It’s not impossible to find people to work there but it’s hard during our busy times (which is the summer and holidays) to deal with finding a new employee along with training and carrying their beginner slack. 


My brothers plan was to work the summer and then go and do his 6 month basic training after that and then start school fall of 2020. This is something he’s been talking about for years. (He’s a kid though so I realize shit changes) Now if he gets this job (which will make him more money now) he says he’s going to push basic training back. This is my side worry, as his sister. I worry he’ll push back his goals/aspirations just to make more money at the moment and it’s going to hurt him in the future. 

I have told him none of this. I don’t know how to go about saying any of it because as his sister I want what is best for him and I want him to get his money but I also want him to carry out his goals/aspirations. He’s my best friend. As his “employer”/coworker, I’m annoyed and it’s affecting my mood around him and I feel like a dick. I want to just speak my mind but it feels sticky. 

Soooo, would I be the asshole if I told him how I felt? Any of it."		1	0
bzgghf	2019-06-11 18:44:33	Grand_Promise	AITA for telling my best friend that the reason guys don't approach her is because she's insecure and has no self confidence	"My best friend Sam (fake name) and I have been friends since grade 9. She was adopted from Sierra Leone and we live in a predominantly white area in Canada. She's 6 feet tall. Since we were in high school she's always been insecure. According to her she never gets attention from guys. I personally don't think it's a bid deal to date in a high school and I told her this so many times but she really used the whole situation to self pity herself. She is a really sweet girl and she's actually really gorgeous and modelesque but she's always ben a little eccentric and awkward and was sometimes teased by annoying boys in our school which made her feel more insecure. I try to be sympathetic to her insecurities were in high school but it kinda gets annoying being around her self pity. Like she really thinks everybody is racist when she was really well liked in our high school and was even voted in student council but sh's so stuck on guys not approaching her. 

We’re in university and this year we lived together along with our other friend Jess. Jess and I started to date and go out more. Sam hasn’t really dated anyone and that has again caused a lot of insecurity. She’s basically said Jess and I get a lot guys because we’re “short, thin and white” This pisses me off because I can’t control what I look like and I believe I have a good personality, self-confidence, take care of myself. But she basically reduces it to me being short and white, like wtf. 

The main drama started at this party 2 weeks ago. There was this guy she had a crush on who lived in our building. He is black and probably like 6'5. We had been trying to say she should talk to him but she refused because she insisted he wouldn’t like her anyway and “probably doesn’t date black girls” At this party he started talking and flirting with Jess. Jess obviously would never go for him but this really hurt Sam and she started crying and wouldn’t talk to us. When she did talk to us she started cussing us out, accused Jess of making a pass at him and then went about how guys date us because we're short and white. 

I just got tired of her always blaming other people or racism or whatever for guy not approaching her so I finally just said that the reason guys don’t like her is because she’s insecure and has no self-esteem and she should stop thinking everyone is racist or whatever and fix her personality. 

She got really offended and now is not talking to me even 2 weeks later. 

Jess thinks I went a little too far but I was just trying to be honest. I don't think what I said was that bad and I love Sam but I honestly think she needs to stop with the pity and get some confidence.

I am a part of a school organization and I am on the governing board. The board consists of a president and then 3 vice presidents all in charge of different departments. I was planning a huge event for the organization and the beginning of it included us chanting in front of a lot of people. I chose a more complex chant because it would impress and make us look good, but a lot of our members did not know it (mostly because a lot had just joined and didnt know any of the chants) Well, we have a position within the organization that is in charge of teaching our members the chants, so I taught it to her (we'll call her sasha) so she could teach them at our meeting the night before. Sasha didnt show up and so the meeting was dismissed early.

Because she skipped the meeting sasha simply made a post on the organizations page with the lyrics. Now keep in mind I chose a complex chant, you can't learn how to do it by just reading the words you have to hear the beat and the speed. The reason why this chant was difficult was because it was extremely fast and long. The event was the next day and I knew that there was no way to teach everyone within 10 minutes beforehand so I changed it to a way easier one that can be taught in less than a minute. I posted the change and the lyrics to the new one right away saying I would teach everyone individually if they needed it when they showed up the next day.

About 10 minutes after making the change I get a lot of angry messages from the other VP (sasha's boss) yelling at me because sasha was super upset that I changed the chant without telling her first. Sasha wanted to teach it because it was her job and it was wrong for me to go over her head and teach the chapter myself. The thing is Sasha didnt know the new chant either so I would have had to teach her just so she could do the same exact thing I did. 

I think I was in the right to change something about MY event without consulting her because it was time sensitive and if it went badly it would reflect on myself and the entire organization. Other people are telling me that I should have gone through Sasha even though it made more work for me because ""she can't learn without someone teaching her.""

Whenever I come back, my cousin is studying, or hanging out in my room . I get home too tired and I have to wait for him to finish until I can go inside and sleep, or hang out in my own fucking room.

he doesn't really say anything and acts as if the room is his until he finishes and I'm starting to get really pissed off.

bzgczj	2019-06-11 18:36:50	theycallmebeezer	AITA For Wanting To Keep My Trees?	"Moved into my current house 2 years ago. I'm the third owner. The original owner, who had the house custom built and was one of the first homes on the street, had also planted 3 cottonwood trees in the backyard to get some decent shade. Now, about 20 years later, these trees are definitely mature and quite large.

My neighbors are the kindest people I've ever shared a property line with. Just super nice. But lately, they have started making comments about my trees every time we're both outside and making small talk. Some examples of the nature of the comments include the following:

* Hinting that these trees have gone past their usual lifetime - which I don't get how that is, because my grandparents have had the same exact type of trees in their backyard for the last 40 years.
* ""People typically cut these trees down after 15 years."" (Again, I've never heard that.)
* General comments about the volume of leaves they produce.
* How much maintenance they are. (The trees themselves aren't high maintenance, unless you want to argue that maybe I'm not trimming them, which could be fair. I don't know.)

&#x200B;

I will say that my trees *can* be a pain in the ass. They sprout leaves in the latter half of March and by mid-June there is already a noticeable number of leaves hitting the ground. And when it's autumn it takes an entire afternoon to rake the leaves up, and I can't use existing tools to suck up the leaves and mulch them because of the number of twigs that fall to the ground with the leaves. So I have to spend an afternoon raking them. And many leaves end up in my neighbor's backyard during autumn. I've felt accountable for that, so I've asked for their permission to come into their yard to rake them up. They say ""No, it's okay.""

&#x200B;

But while the trees can be a pain, they're not such a pain that I want to pay a professional an arm and a leg to cut them down. Besides, we love the shade during the summer and don't want to start over with new trees.

So, am I the asshole for not giving in to my neighbor's wishes to cut my trees down?

tl;dr - It's pretty obvious my neighbors want me to cut my trees down even without them coming out and saying it. But I don't want to cut them down. AITA?

My best friend, we’ll call him Caleb, and I wanted to do something on Saturday. Long story short, my mom organized a play date at our local arcade. His mom agreed, and my brother’s friend came. 

Caleb’s stepsisters were apparently visiting that day from North Carolina, and so for some reason they came along. I wasn’t happy with it, but I didn’t say anything. 

I tell Caleb to follow me so we could start playing games, and he told me that he was supposed to stick with his stepsisters for some time. I was starting to get aggravated, as I had only invited Caleb.
 
His stepsisters were circling around a few claw machine games. I was getting bored, so I walked away. Caleb followed me and asked me to socialize with them. I’m pretty antisocial, and didn’t want to do this. I told him that I wasn’t a big fan of their personalities, and I was antisocial. He let it go and we played some other games. 

Eventually it was time to skate. We went to the skating rink and got our skates on. We skated for a little bit, and then I asked if I was allowed to come over to their house. His mom said she’d think about it. A few minutes later, she called Caleb over. She asked if I was okay with the stepsisters being there. I had told Caleb earlier that I didn’t like them, but I tried no to be too rude and asked him not to tell anyone I said that. Caleb has a big mouth, and he told his mom that I didn’t like the girls. His mom got frustrated and said that I didn’t give her a chance. I did, and judging by how they were acting, I didn’t like them.  I wasn’t allowed to go. Me and Caleb were talking on a bench about how upset he was that I couldn’t go. He then said it was all my fault. I was astonished and aggravated. I asked how it was my fault, and he said it was because I was being mean to his stepsisters. I told him that I was in no way being mean, as I had said nothing rude to them. He told me that I should’ve spent time with them and not avoid them and exclude them. I was livid at this point. I told him that I had invited him, not his stepsisters. I was not obligated to spend time with them. I didn’t even know they were going to be there. I would’ve given them another chance if Caleb wouldn’t have said that. After telling him all of that, he told me he was going to hang out with his family, not mine. He left soon after. We haven’t talked for a few days.

"I didn't really know how to word the title and this might be a little long winded so sorry in advance. Basically my ""friend""/former roommate [21F] sexually harassed another friend [21M] of ours for months over a year ago and no one really batted an eye because she was a girl and he was a guy.

I wanted to know if I would be the asshole for talking with him about it, since no one including him seemed to think it was more than a nuisance and just pathetically annoying at the time, or at least he never outright said that he considered it harassment. But just recently I was thinking over a lot of the shit that she pulled over the two years I lived with her and what she did would without a doubt be considered sexual harassment and just downright disgusting if it was coming from a guy to a girl.

She would touch him and try to cuddle him anytime we hung out as a group and watched a movie (basically anytime the lights were out) and he made it expressly clear he didn't want that multiple times. She completely ignored him anytime he told her no, clearly disrespected his boundaries all the time, and tried to coerce him into doing things like making out with her after he rejected her. She even used the words ""c'mon you know you want to."" If a guy had ever said that to a girl it would creep me the hell out and he'd be immediately ostracized and shamed for it, but for some reason no one in our friend group including myself seemed to really grasp that this was genuine harassment.

The friend in question had mentioned it made him uncomfortable a couple times and he was clearly annoyed, but he had never expressed anything that indicated it was a serious concern. But he is the type of person that never talks about stuff like that because he genuinely hates inconveniencing people no matter what. The reason I ask if I would be the asshole to ask him about it is that it was a long time ago, he hasn't mentioned it since, and he and her are still in contact/are friends, albeit not great ones. 

I just don't want it to seem like I'm just talking to him about it because I want to complain about her more (which I will admit I do a lot). I also don't want to make him uncomfortable by phrasing it that way and basically tell him that he was sexually harassed because that's not really my call to make if he doesn't feel that way about it. I do want to apologize to him for not calling her out and stopping her way sooner though, I just don't know if it's appropriate to bring it up so long after it happened when everyone seems to be over it or just forgot about it. I feel like it might just be me being petty at her rather than starting an actual productive conversation for him and I don't want to make him uncomfortable unnecessarily. Plus it would probably cause a lot of drama and her drama was exactly why I moved out, so I'd be kind of a hypocrite in that sense.

bzgafi	2019-06-11 18:31:24	Theswanofavon	AITA for letting my friend (18M) who was disowned/kicked out stay with me and my family?	"A week ago, my friend M went to a Pride walk in our city. The next morning, his father saw him tagged on Facebook and kicked him out of the house with no notice. He had to be out by noon that day. 

M messaged me. Then, the first thing I did was call my parents, who were out of the house. I told them M’s situation and how he needed a place to crash. They agreed, and said he could stay for 2 weeks. I moved M in. The work was done before they were home, and I cooked dinner for them as a thank you. He’s been living out of his suitcase with all his boxes stored in our garage.

Now, my family is well-off. My mom doesn’t work but my father does. We have a spare bedroom, but my parents insisted my friend stays on the couch in the basement so he doesn’t get “too comfortable.” He’s been living with us for just over a week. He now has 2 jobs and a nice apartment on lock (yay M!) so he’s moving out tomorrow.

I thought everything was fine. Apparently I was wrong. Turns out, my mother has been harbouring the belief that I guilted her into letting M stay with us. That I’m not taking any responsibility for how much of an inconvenience he is. My father hasn’t been working out in our home gym because it’s the same room M is in. We also have M’s bird hanging in the TV room, and he chirps in the evenings. Apparently I have no sense of how much this impacts them, and I was abusing their hospitality by asking.

To give perspective, both me and M have been doing daily chores and yardwork, unless we’re working our jobs. M has been trying his best to be a model tenant (minus the rent paying— my parents don’t need, nor would they accept the money). 

He’s almost moved out and my mother chose to tell me that she’s mad at me NOW. That she doesn’t think I did enough to take responsibility for my guest. Apparently he tends to leave the light on in rooms he was in, wasting energy. He puts dishes in the dishwasher ONLY when asked to, otherwise in the sink. His toenails are too long. He only showers twice a week, and he tracked mud in the hall once.

I was supposed to pick up on all those habits and tell him to correct them so my mother didn’t have to. I asked if she wanted me to tell him now, and she said no, it was too late. 

I’m trying to see how I could have done this better. I’m aware that I put my parents in a tough position; they felt that morally, they couldn’t say no. I get that it could be viewed as manipulative of me to even ask them in the first place. My mother said if I wanted to do better, “next time, just don’t ask.”

Now I’m at a loss of what to do. Clearly, I’ll never ask them to let a friend crash again. I’ve already agreed to cleaning the basement top to bottom once M leaves. And yet, she’s still mad at me. She’s been snapping at me all day. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzga7b	2019-06-11 18:31:03	Icecream_sunday	AITA for not going to a wedding that I wasn’t formally invited to?	"So my good friend linked up with an old high school buddy of hers that’s engaged while they were taking some class to get a license for insurance sales. They got close during this time  and fast forward a couple weeks, she asked her to be one of her bridesmaid. I had the opportunity to meet her one night we all went out, that same night she invited me and my friend to the wedding. I agreed to go to the wedding, and so did another friend of ours that was there hanging out with us. We never got any formal wedding invitation or anything to RSVP for the wedding its self.  
 
A week before the wedding itself, my other friend decides to sell out and not go to the wedding for what ever reason, this is where the issues begins. So not knowing anyone besides my friend that’s a bridesmaid, and the bride which I don’t even know her last name, I start to realize I’m going to be alone the entire wedding. So I decide to follow in my friends food steps and sell out the day night before, I just texted my friend that’s the bridesmaid that I won’t be attending the wedding.

Now my friend won’t talk to me because I made her look bad since I didn’t want to go to the wedding. I was never formally invited to nor did I RSVP. I know it was around $100 a person, but am I really the AH for selling out and not going to someone’s wedding I don’t know? 

TL;DR: flaked on a wedding I said I was going to go to because my friend sold out, now everyone is making me feel bad.

EDIT: sorry for not being to clear with my post, the bride and groom paid for everyone’s food and “seat” for the wedding. Under no circumstances was I going to be responsible for my plate.

Friend A-My personal friend  that is the bridesmaid 

Friend B- My personal friend that was also invited that also had no relation to the couple getting married. 

Friend A is mad at because both me and friend B didn’t show up to the wedding."	No A-holes here	0	0

bzg7py	2019-06-11 18:25:50	LastArgument887	AITA for wanting time to get away from my family on Father’s Day?	"I have a great marriage and a great family. We have been married for 12 years and we have three kids - twins that are 4 and a singleton who is 2. I work overnights and on Sunday morning I get home at 0430 then get up at 0800 with the family for the full day. This starts my 3 day weekend since I work 4 10s. I watch the kids M-F while the wife works a normal schedule and that means I run on 3 hours of sleep for Th and F. 

This is our agreed upon dynamic and I went into this fully knowing how it would work. We did it this way because wifey doesn’t want to use day care. I have friends but I only hang out with them every other weekend when we do game nights on Sundays. Again, this is the dynamic I agreed to and have no problems with. I know things will change as the kids get older. 

Sunday this week is Father’s Day and when my wife asked me what I wanted I responded without hesitation:  I want to sleep in until I wake up naturally. I want my favorite meal for lunch and then to go out to game night. 

When I told my wife this she seemed kind of miffed and said something about  not spending any time with the family. To my eyes this is kind of a day for me so I should be allowed to do what I want to within reason. The same thing goes for Mother’s day but my wife doesn’t seem to want to take advantage of it in the same way I do.

SIL, BIL, and their 5 year old are flying in from out of state to go to a wedding that is an hour away from where we live. We are not invited to the wedding (we don't know the people). Money shouldn't be a huge issue or limiting factor - we are both comfortable.

SIL wants us to pick them up from the airport, drive them to and from the wedding, and back to the airport. They want to stay Friday thru Sunday. Orig the agreement was that the could stay Friday night and they would find their own way to and from, and now they want to stay the whole weekend, plus the extra driving for us back and forth. They say their daughter is so excited to see the new baby, and ""hug and kiss"" her.

I put my foot down and said they could come for the one night, and we would not be driving them. More important, no touching, hugging or kissing my daughter - they might be sick after being on a plane and I don't want such a young baby getting even a cold, as it can be so dangerous at that age.

SIL had a melt down that they have to pay for a hotel, that we think their daughter is ""dirty,"" and now isn't speaking to us.

I'm resolute that this is the best thing for her, but my husband is upset.

bzg67o	2019-06-11 18:22:29	Drakan7	WIBTA if I don’t go to a “friends” birthday get together?	"Quick backstory - I was friends with this person for about 9 years and for most part we were really good mates.

In the latter part of it though I noticed he’d never come to you, you’d have to go to him to hang out or hang out in his home town (we lived about 7 miles apart and both drove). 

Skip back to two years ago I moved into my own place, about 40 minutes drive from both our homes due to cheaper property prices and work. 

In that two years he’s never been to visit and on the few occasions I’ve seen him I’ve gone back there. Even when I was going through a really bad time last year he messaged me to say if I ever wanted to pop over! Didn’t come to me, just if I wanted to go to his.

Anyway pretty much due to that we’ve drifted apart. It’s his birthday this Saturday and he’s organising a few people to go out (in his home town). I’ve declined mainly due to the fact I just can’t be bothered anymore. We’ve not spoken in 8 months and haven’t seen each other in 15 month.

Speaking to my family though they say I ought to make the effort and I’m being an asshole for not “making the effort”. So reddit community, what do you think - Will I be the asshole for not going?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bzg59i	2019-06-11 18:20:29		WIBTA for ending this friendship?	"I have this friend. We'll call him Sam. Sam and I have been friends for years, and we've always been uncommonly close. Old chat logs of our go on for pages and pages and pages. Every day we'd chat about anything and everything. What we were eating, new life routines we were trying, serious stuff about feelings and shit. It was not uncommon for me to know exactly where he physically was on any given day, just because we'd talk so extensively about our plans for the day and our lives. We were really REALLY close.

About a year ago, Sam started spending a lot more time with other friends, without me. I wrote this off at first. I felt the usual jealousy and FOMO that you get in those situations, but I knew the adult thing was to work through it, because it shouldn't be a big deal if he's spending time with other people than me. However, our communication began to deteriorate. Where once we'd texted non-stop for days and days at a time, we soon started going a week or more without any communication.

I tried engaging. I tried to ask him about his day, or his latest morning routine, and was rebuffed. He seemed genuinely angry that I would take such an interest in his life to that level of detail. I let it go on for a few months, then I brought up my concerns. He did not react well. He generally stated that nothing was wrong or had changed with our friendship, but his warning to me was that if I became demanding of his time, he would begin to dread interacting with me, and would engage with me even less. I let another four or five months pass and it got worse and worse and worse and worse. I rarely saw or heard from him, and when I did, it was a quick hangout, or a link to a funny meme.

I have voiced my concerns twice further in different ways, each about 3-4 months apart, and each time I was told nothing was wrong. He has given several reasons for our spending less time together, but none of these reasons seems to be affecting his other friendships. I was at his place the other day with some other friends and realized I knew nothing about him. Where they were all talking about his upcoming plans and mutual events they were attending, I had nothing to share, nothing to ask about. I had nothing.

Lately, I've fallen into such a despair that I feel like I've been walking through a fog. I work, I eat, I sleep, I wake up, I do it all again. I grieve daily for the loss of the closeness of my friendship with Sam. I feel abandoned, excluded, and disrespected. I think the responsible thing to do here is to end my friendship with Sam. It's not punitive. I don't feel that he needs to be punished, I just feel like if this goes on, so much resentment will build, a conflict is inevitable."	No A-holes here	1	0

bzg4wn	2019-06-11 18:19:50	throwaway-forkicks	AITA for denying my friend my house	"Throwaway for obvious reasons. first time poster long time lurker. Sorry for the long post

Recently got back in touch with a friend I was close to growing up. We moved pretty far from one another a few years back & it made things difficult. We haven’t seen each other in years.

2 months ago she said her and a friend were visiting my area for a week to do some sight seeing & wanted to know if we could stay at my childhood home (we’re both college students) instead of a hotel to save money. Late summer, one week. Initially, I wanted to say no.

For starters, the only place in the house with two spare beds doesn’t have a working air conditioning system & not a lot of air flow, so it gets Dangerously Hot in there during the summer. On top of that, I don’t know her friend at all, which isn’t an issue of trust but an issue of “I don’t know how to ask my dad to let them stay when I know only 1” I wasn’t sure, but this is my friend; I figured that we could work something out. I told her I would ask.

Flash forward a few weeks, I’m finishing up spring semester. Its Exhausting. I’m introverted &have social anxiety, & living with 5 other people had my battery totally drained. I started a new job, on top of summer classes that I have to commute to & I don’t have time to recharge. I ask my dad about her staying. He says he isn’t sure. he planned on taking a trip in Aug. & figured I’d go with him, & the dates of her coming and us leaving might overlap. he didn’t feel comfortable with them staying while we were gone. I asked him to keep me updated, knowing I’d likely have to say no to my friend, which tbh relieved me bc I was stressed about the whole thing. Excited to see her, but stressed for above reasons

This morning, my dad got laid off from work. We’ll be fine, but it means that trip from earlier is cancelled. Which is also fine. But theoretically my friend could now stay. when I told her “hey, this is the situation, I dunno yet”, she responded her sympathies and more.

She said her friend was no longer coming due to their own issues, & that she would potentially be bringing her dog with her, who apparently alerts her for asthma. I hadn’t known she had a service animal/alert dog (dunno if he’s officially trained and listed as a service animal or not, but I’m assuming he is) nor did I know if she planned on bringing him from the beginning and only told me now. I love dogs, & if it’s a service or alert dog it’s different than just Bringing A Dog, but it’s still something to consider especially because of the whole heating situation

When she asked me if I could let her stay, I said “I don’t think so. I don’t want to ask again right now & don’t want to keep you hanging” which is true but I feel bad.

AITA for telling my friend she can’t stay for the week? this is my friend, it would only be a week, &she has a service animal. But also, the air conditioner situation, my dads job, & my own obligations including recharging my social battery."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

They straight away said I was bossy today. I took their tone as non joking. So I asked for clarity “are you being genuine in your comments”? To which he replied yes and the person next to him piped in and said yes as well.

So I got my car keys and went to fetch something from my car. 

I can’t remember the exact conversation when I came back to my table but they then turned their tune into saying “it was a joke”. 

I would take it as a joke, but there have been lots of incidences like comments about m not getting the stationary order correct, him asking me not to shout at him when he asked for IT help, him asking me not to get territorial over some paper files I was archiving. 

Considering I avoid talking to the guy because he made jokes about our boss suffering domestic violence (he comes to work out bruises on his face) and I am vague about my life outside work.... I kind think I’m not the asshole and his comments are serious.

"So, yeah, getting my nails done at a salon when this overweight lady comes in to get a pedicure. She’s not slightly overweight, but a lot. I don’t care at all about how much she weighs, but it’s important for the story. There were other overweight people in the store (I only noticed this when they started picking on her), but of course this lady was picked out because she’s very overweight. 

Sooo I had my headphones in at first, but I took them off because once she was getting into the chair the employee was like, “go easy, don’t break it.” I was shocked, and I took out my headphones and started paying attention after that. The employee was at first asking her harmless questions, but it turned into stuff about her weight. 

“[hesitates] Are all your family this big? What do they think about your weight? What are you doing to lose it?” 

Comments that aren’t being so out there about her weight, but they were pretty bad questions to ask. And the girl seemed really embarrassed about it. She was like, “yeah, I’ve been trying to lose weight, but it’s difficult. My parents keep pushing me to lose weight, but it’s very hard for me. They’re slim, blah blah blah...”  but I could tell she wasn’t cool with it because her face was super red and it was clear she didn’t want to be talking about this and that she was super embarrassed.

Eventually the lady was like, “boys would like you a lot better too if you lost the weight.” And she was like yeah, I’ve never had a boy like me so that would be nice. And the lady was like, “you would be so pretty if you lose the weight. Gorgeous.” At this point she even asked me, “wouldn’t she look so pretty if she lost the weight?” and I just pointed at my headphones and said, “sorry, can’t hear you.” Damn. I don’t know why. All I had to say was, “She’s pretty like she is now.” 

And this lady keeps going. The girl was like, “a lot of people at my high school make fun of me, that’s why I’m really anxious to lose the weight.” And the lady was like, “They’re making fun of you is a good thing, they’re just trying to encourage you to lose the weight by shaming you, and it’s working.” The girl was like, “yeah, but it’s really and.” Gross stuff. The worst thing the lady said was, “Don’t you want to get married? A man won’t marry you how you are now.” I was the only one in hearing distance that could have said something, but I didn’t. I kept silent. The employee doing my nails finished, so it should have been done then, but it wasn’t. I got my finger nails done, too. The girl ended up leaving before me. Her employee came over to mine and they started talking about her. She was like, “It’s a shame. I don’t let my kids hang out with people like that, it’ll encourage them.” I could have again said something now, but I just thought “I have anxiety, it isn’t my responsibility to say anything,” so I didn’t.

bzg0rk	2019-06-11 18:11:09	maybeayri	AITA for borrowing the family car to get snacks and taking a bit longer than usual?	"The whole trip for snacks took a little over an hour from the time I left the house to when I pulled back into the driveway. It's my mom's car and I got permission from her to use it to go to a grocery store or two for snacks I've been wanting for awhile. We're at the edge of the bus routes and it doesn't go in the direction I need to go for this. She said to be back soon enough for her to get to somewhere by 8. Fine, I was leaving at 5:20ish. Even if I took a bit longer than usual, should be fine. I wasn't told of any other commitments and my sister was napping on the couch when I left.

First I visited Target to see if they had cinnamon bun Oreos. They didn't, so I went to HEB for the actual grocery shopping since they have better prices. I let Mom know about this. She requests a rotisserie chicken and my sister wants me to get an energy drink. This is at 5:40-5:45. All's well so far.

Due to some confusing road signage, I get temporarily turned around on the interchange and it ended up taking me a bit longer to get to HEB. I get there, grab the snacks that I've been wanting. Sadly, the rotisserie chicken ended up not coming home with me since food stamps didn't cover it for some reason. I'm checking out at 6:10ish, and my sister sends me a bunch of texts asking me where I am, that she's going to miss visitation with her son at the mental health facility that she put him in which they were apparently supposed to leave a while ago for, and that she's gonna have to tell him that she's failing him because of me. [Here's the screenshots of that.](https://imgur.com/a/npTay4t). I get home and she yells at me in the same vein. My mom joins in, siding with her and trying to calm her down. 

For some additional context: my sister put her son in a mental health facility following a series of escalating meltdowns that we're not equipped to handle right now. She has been visiting him daily, taking Mom's car so she could do so freely. It's about a 45 minute drive or a 1 hr 40 min bus ride. From what I've seen, she's typically gone all day for this and comes home for brief periods until after his dinner. I haven't been told the timing of each meal. Her monopolization of the car has made it difficult for me to run any errands because when she isn't using it all day, Mom usually needs it. I thought this would be a safe enough window for me to get some stuff that I wanted. This is the first time I'm told that she has to be there before 7 for this meal.

Then she asks me if I want to take her phone number in case I see the dog. Im going to sound judgmental but she seemed really dodgy and I was worried that she wanted me to take out my phone and grab it from me (there was no one else around). So I pretended to take down her number by repeating it into my microphone and said goodbye.

Several hours passed and with most of the group having read and not responded to my message, I figured they didn't want to and accepted an invitation from a different group of friends to watch the game at their apartment.  Later that day I  was talking to one of the members of the group chat over discord and he did ask about my plans for the game, and I told him I was going to a friends apartment but would meet them at the bar if they went out.  The next day it turns all the members of the original group do want to meet up, and I stay silent as they discuss plans.  As I'm on the train into Toronto, one of them calls me and asks what I'm doing.  I tell him that my friend and I are going to the apartment, but we're going to get a drink first to kill time if he wants to join us.  Unfortunately we got to Toronto later than expected, and decide to head straight to the apartment.  I call my friend and let him know our new plan, and tell him to let us know what bar they end up at so we can meet.  As the start of the game comes closer, the rest of the original chat members join up in the city but can't find a bar with enough space to let them in.  I text my friend if they were able to find a place, and his only response is ""you need to fix this"".  I ask the person who lives at the apartment if he would be alright with them coming as well, but he says it's a small apartment and he doesn't want to bring in 5 extra people he's never met, which is understandable.  By halfway through the second quarter they still haven't found a place to watch the game, so the host offers to let them come by.  I call the friend who texted me to let him know, and he refuses to answer his phone.  I eventually pass the invite along and when the group shows up they tell me that the friend who texted me got pissed and left to go to his girlfriend's house, and two of the three people that did show up are going to go home and just chill together instead of stay.  Today when I tried to text him to apologize he either doesn't respond or only responds with ""mhm"".   I realize I should have mentioned that I was going to the apartment earlier that day, and I feel really bad we couldn't all watch the game together, but am I the asshole for going to the apartment instead of meeting up with them?"		1	0
bzfymw	2019-06-11 18:06:43		AITA for calling my friend a faggot at work?	"I’m a bisexual female, my friend is a queer trans who commonly refers to himself as a “tranny faggot”. We call each other “fag” and “faggot” all the time. I wasn’t openly bisexual at work before this situation because it’s not something I like to broadcast to people I don’t know very well. In the lunch room I sat across my friend and says “What’s up, faggot?” and some of my coworkers seated at the adjacent table to us let out a gasp and looked at me like I just killed a hamster. One of them is gay. I assured them that I’m bisexual so all is good, but that response wasn’t enough to satisfy them. I started getting hounded because I used an offensive term in the workplace and my friend tried to defend me by saying we’re both apart of the LGBT community. Eventually the argument subsided and everyone resumed with whatever they were doing. I didn’t think the issue would be taken any further but next thing I knew, at the end of the shift I’m being called into my manager’s office. I explained the situation and she said being bisexual doesn’t entitle me to the word “faggot” because it’s a derogatory term that was directed exclusively at gays. I pointed out that she’s invalidating my sexual orientation and I’ve been in same-sex relationships before. I asked her if she would be okay with [openly gay coworker] saying faggot and she said yes. So I asked why it’s not okay for me, a member of the LGBT community, to say faggot, and she said it’s because I’m not gay, and bisexual girls have it easier. Then she wrote me up.

bzfx0t	2019-06-11 18:03:24		AITA for getting upset at my husband for streaming?	"My husband and I moved his computer into our bedroom. It was a mutual decision (my idea even). Last night, while I was in bed trying to sleep, he started a stream at around 10:00/10:30. I told him his computer was too bright for me to sleep, so he turned the lights down a bit. It was too loud for me to sleep, so I tried turning on some music to drown out the stream, but it didn't work. I went to sleep in the bathroom because at least it was darker in there, but still too loud. I gather up my little bed and open the door. He looks at me and asks what I'm doing, I tell him I can't sleep in there, so I'll sleep in the hallway. He asks, ""Is it because I'm being too loud?"" I say yes. He says ""sorry"" and turns back to his game. Unfortunately, my roommate was watching TV and laughing with her lil sister, which was too loud to sleep in the hallway, so I tell my husband I'll be sleeping in the basement instead. Unfortunately, again, a roommate was up watching a movie in the basement, so I couldn't sleep there either. I told my husband that and that I'd be sleeping on the middle floor. There was nowhere else for me to go. After an hour of this, he just said, ""wife I'll stop if you want to come back"". 


At this point, I tried to sleep on the floor 4 separate times, ending up curled up on hard wooden floor while he continues to stream. I was frustrated and tired. I know I could have just said, ""okay"" and gone up to bed, but I was feeling really hurt at this point because he was fully aware of all the negative effects his streaming that late at night was having on me, and he didn't stop. I responded with ""If my husband doesn't see anything wrong with continuing to stream while his wife curls up on the floor somewhere trying to get some sleep, then I really don't have anything to ask for"". I was met by a very angry wall of text about how he turned down the brightness of his computer for me and made a huge effort not to inconvenience me. He told me that if I wanted to come sleep in bed, he'd sleep in the car. I asked if we could talk about it and he said no because he was too tired. I asked to talk again today and he said no because he was feeling too groggy. I slept on the floor last night, and he's canceled our Lagoon Amusement park day to stream and be alone.


I feel bad because I, apparently, really hurt his feelings. I was fine sleeping in the hallway until I couldn't and it became a game of ""where can I go?"" I've always encouraged him to stream (this is the first time I've had an issue with him streaming), always asking him to stream when he plays a game because I love to comment on it and watch. Yes, yes, I know our marriage needs work. I'm not asking for a detailed analysis of the root problems in our relationship. In this specific situation, am I the asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	1	0

I've dated around 3 guys, who either when I started dating them or later on in the relationship have gotten obsessed with working out. It's not bad to want to be healthy but let's just say over the last 6 years of my life I've been listening to the best protein shakes, workout methods, what I should and shouldn't do, what my PARENTS (should or shouldn't do and of course, each one of my boyfriends have had their own opinions on what's the right way to workout and isn't (as suggested by their own trainers, or read online). Of course we've spoken about other things but a majority of the time it was about them working out.

Recently, I got in touch with a guy friend from ages ago who has been working out now as well. We've been in touch for around 6 months now and it's all he talks about. Like, I'm so afraid to mention how I work out or what I do to face his critic as all my boyfriends had done before. And besides that, I'm frankly just tired of it. I've kind of told him this several times before but he speaks about it so passionately and because he knows I hate it, he'll just sound sad and goes okay nevermind I'll stop talking about it each time he starts. And I give in each time because I feel bad and as a good friend I should support my friends passions but I've just gotten so sick and tired of hearing SO DAMN MUCH about working out I feel annoyed or tired anytime through the conversation.

This means that 3 weeks out of the month I work 1500 miles from where they live and 1 week a month I work from home and am with my family. I've lived in my current house about 2 years. I have only spoken with my neighbor 3 times prior to this, each time him complaining about cars being parked on the street or in front of his house.

I have a large tree in front of my house and my neighbor is concerned that it could damage his house. One Sunday when I am home, he mentions that he is concerned about the tree hanging over his house. I said, ""I am flying out today and will be back in 3 weeks and will deal with it when I get back."" Two weeks later I get a text from him saying, ""I had the tree trimmed, you owe me $300."" I didn't contract for the trimming, have no idea if this is a fair price or not. I researched the law in my area and he is legally allowed to trim my tree over his airspace, but I am not obligated to pay for it. So I offer to pay $150 to be neighborly. He rejects my offer, saying, ""Not my tree."" This is all over text messaging

I return home a week later, figured I would talk to him in person. However, in that time he decided to have someone trim back a small tree that hung over his driveway. Its literally like someone extended the fence straight up and cut everything that was even an inch over it. There was no threat to his house and the tree looks like crap now. The cutters also left all of the branches on my lawn for me to deal with. Am I the asshole for refusing to pay anything after this second cutting occurred?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzfvch	2019-06-11 18:00:13	CMarae32	AITA for not buying my stepmom a Mother’s Day gift?	I (16F) moved out of my mothers house about 3 years ago due to her being in an abusive relationship. I moved in with my father and his girlfriend (they weren’t married at the time I moved in.) When I moved in, we got along really well & then they got married about a year after I moved in. After they got married everything about this woman changed. I mean like she was evil 😂. I was raised by the respect and disrespect rules. Respect everyone and anyone until you are disrespected, but when you’re disrespected, don’t disrespect just ignore. So my stepmom bought me a couple things for my birthday the first two years I lived there. Then for my 16th birthday I only received a phone from my dad (NOT complaining at all, I could care less if I got anything.) My stepmom believes that since I was 16 now I could get a job, which l did. Before I got my job, I had went to see my mom for Mother’s Day because her and her abusive boyfriend weren’t together anymore, and of course I miss her. But I wouldn’t be around her if her boyfriend was there. I went to see her and bought her an 8$ necklace (was 50$ but it was on sale) and when I got back home my stepmom thinks I “disrespected her” because I used my dads money to get my mother a necklace and didn’t buy her anything. Me and my stepmom never communicate I barely ever see her and see no point in getting her anything for Mother’s Day because frankly she isn’t my mother and she isn’t even really there for me. She has her own kids to get her gifts, but they didn’t get her anything either which makes me feel bad but she didn’t get upset at them for not getting anything!! She only was upset with me?? AITA??

bzfur2	2019-06-11 17:58:58		AITA for moving out?	"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I am moving to another state in a couple months, but my lease is up at the end of this month. My roommate has known about the timing of this move since earlier this year when I made this plan. I tried to extend my lease for another month to cover the gap between when it ends and when I move. In the state I live in, this is perfectly legal and many tenants do this. My landlord recently told me that I need to renew the full 12 month lease, find a new tenant next month, and then amend the lease.

The issue is that it doesn't make sense for me to sign a year long lease when I'll only be here for a month of it. I don't want to risk being on the hook for this apartment financially in the event that we don't find someone to take over the room. My roommate just expected that I would do this, and didn't listen to me when I expressed concern. I told him that I'm not renewing a lease under these circumstances and reminded him that I never planned on signing another year long lease for this exact reason. He now claims he didn't realize I didn't want to renew the lease and find someone to take over.

That said, my roommate took charge and posted our apartment online a couple of months ago, because he wants to stay in the apartment. I was only recently given access to this account, and I saw that countless people have messaged him for over a month and he never responded to anyone. He's now putting it on me to find someone to fill the room so that he doesn't have to move out at the end of the month, but I don't think that it's my responsibility to fill my place because the lease is ending and I'm not in charge of making sure he has a place to live.

Of course I plan on helping my roommate find someone, because I don't want to leave him in the lurch. But on the other hand, I feel like he's put it on me to make sure he doesn't lose the apartment. I feel that this should have been taken more seriously weeks ago. Plenty of people have expressed interest in the room and it could have easily been resolved had my roommate bothered to respond to anyone. He's taking no responsibility for this situation.

My question is, AITA/in the wrong here? How should I be handling this situation?"		1	0

The heat in my parents’ house broke on Sunday, and my mom and brother came and visited me at my apartment so that they could cool down with my working A/C. They stayed until they had to go home for bed (I would have had them stay the night, but my mother has back problems that requires certain sleeping situations.) Yesterday, while I was at work, my mom called and asked if she could cool down at my apartment again, and I told her yes. When I got home at five, I politely let her know that I needed the apartment to myself at some point. (I’m quite introverted and need time to myself to recover from social things, and my complicated relationship with my parents has a way of tiring me out). I sat down and watched some Netflix with her, and around an half and a half to two hours later, I let her know that I needed that alone time now. She pouted and complained a bit, but left with no problem. 

I called my dad today to ask a question. At the end of the call, he said that he was shocked that I kicked my mother out of my apartment. I was surprised and explained the situation, but he still thinks I shouldn’t have kicked her out (which seems kinda harsh to me).  I previously was sure that I was fine, but that made me wonder. So Reddit, AITA?  

Reasons I could be: her A/C was broken and she thinks she’s menopausal, so hot flashes

This happened in Dead By Daylight, a game heavily reliant on stealth.

In my lobby on the opposite team there was a guy whose username was literally twitch.tv/(name) . Curious, I searched him up and found out that he was indeed streaming at the time. To me, this made very little sense, as he was broadcasting to the killer (Enemy Team) exactly where he was, even though the whole point of the game was to be stealthy. After seeing that he was actually streaming, I closed the tab and continued the game.

After completely annihilating this streamer and his team, I talked to them on the chat that appears after the game is over. I basically told them that it's a bad idea telling everyone you're streaming in a stealth game, as I could easily have just watched his stream and went ""oh, he's there. "" and killed him. He immediately assumed that that was what I did and accused me of admitting to stream sniping and reported me for doing so. He also mentioned that he could name himself whatever he wants and that it was easy advertising, which yeah he can and obviously it's advertising as I literally found him in seconds.

Afterwards, I talked to him a bit on his stream and he still accused me of stream sniping and told me off about how that's against the rules and I shouldn't have done it.

TLDR: Guy advertises that he's streaming while playing a stealth game. I warn him after the game is over that people could easily watch his stream and win the game easily. He accused me of doing exactly that even though I told him I didn't and reported and insulted me. Was I the bad guy here? All I wanted to do was help..."	Not the A-hole	0	0

The public buses usually all stop at the main bus stop on my university campus, the bus drivers will go inside to grab some food or use the bathroom. The only nearby unlocked building does not have direct line of sight to the bus stop so waiting in there is not an option if your bus is already here as the driver might leave. 

By the time myself and a few other students arrived at the stop, my bus was already stopped there and the driver had left to go inside.We waited for about 10 minutes but we were all freezing our asses off. The cold was so unbearable I could feel my face stinging so I pulled the bus door open (didn't force it just a gentle pull and it opened) we all got in and then I closed the door behind us. (All students have free bus passes included with tuition so we weren't sneaking free rides plus usually when it isn't freezing the bus driver will just leave the door open knowing students will just walk on to the bus having passes.) Once we all got in some mid 40s guy already sitting in the bus started this conversation.

Guy: ""Didn't you see the door was closed? You aren't allowed to open them""

Me: ""Ya but it is freezing out and we all have passes so what's the big deal?""

Guy: ""Who do you think you are, just walking in here? You have to wait for the driver!""

He seemed very adamant about the rules so I asked

Me:"" Do you work for [City's] public transit?""

Guy: ""That's not the point, you aren't supposed to ...""

(This guy's attitude as if he was the authority here while obviously just being another passenger rubbed me the wrong way so I got short with him)

Me: ""Look buddy if you don't work here your opinion means literally nothing to me if you want to stand out in the cold you are welcome to it but I am staying in the bus"" 

I then proceed to ignore him and put my headphones in. I could see him seething in his seat while giving me dirty looks. The bus driver walks in a few minutes later asks for bus passes for the people that walked in we all hold them up and he starts driving.

Her folks have been trying to arrange her marriage for a few years now, and while she's an absolutely beautiful, academically accomplished and hard working girl, she's terribly whimsical and flippant and often ends up taking poor decisions.

We were talking and she told me that while she has never slept with anyone yet, she's made out/second base with 15 guys in the past few years. She then asked me if that's a bad thing. I was kind of caught off guard and said people experiment when they're younger (she is now 26) and I can't really judge her because I kind of wanted to casual date when I was younger too, although I realized very quickly it wasn't worth it for me.

She then proceeded to tell me some of the guys were those she met in an arranged marriage setting, she knew she wasn't going to go forth with them after that interaction, they both had a few drinks and started getting intimate. But that she made sure she called them later and told them it wasn't going to work out. The more I thought about it later, it kind of set off red flags for me. I can understand it happening once or twice, but 15 times? It just seemed like she was never making decisions on judging these guys better, instead would be turned off by one niggling thing like their job or their height, but make out with them any way.

I can see why my thoughts come across as judging her, and frankly it's none of my business except she did ask me for my opinion. At the time,  I thought nothing of it. But I feel she's increasingly harming herself by turning this into a pattern. WIBTA if I advised her against it?

Edit: I also wanted to point out that I was concerned for the guys' feelings too, as it seemed like in a lot of these cases, the guy was interested, my friend knew, but she had already made up her mind.

My camp needed 2 people ASAP because 2 bailed last minute. Jen said she wanted the job; I told my boss. Jen never applies. My admin staff are asking me what the deal is. Here’s the convo that ensued:  
 

&#x200B;

M: We hired 2 and aren't hiring now. I'm frustrated because I vouched for you since you said you were interested and would apply. I feel like you didn't come through for me without any explanation.

J: I had a crazy busy week and haven't had any time to chill or apply. I've had exams and interviews, not to mention a shit ton of assignments. Today \[a week after being told about the app\] was the first day I've had to relax and I was going to apply tonight. \[We're in a group chat together and friends on Snapchat, so I know this isn't true, she stays up watching Netflix and goes to the pool often, which isn't bad or anything, just why lie?\]

M: I get being busy, I work almost 80 hours a week and am still taking classes (working towards nursing school) so I totally get having assignments/exams every week and I'm also applying to jobs. I know it can all be a lot but this application wouldn't have taken more than 30 min. It's just really frustrating and embarrassing to stick your neck out and have a friend not come through, especially since I let you know it was ASAP. I have my whole admin team asking why you never applied.

J: Dude it was a fast turn around and that's not normal. I know you said it was ASAP but I was busy. I've also been dealing with school stuff and interviews. I'm not going to run myself ragged over a summer job. I'm sorry you're upset but I don't think you should be mad at me. I'm more concerned about my classes and mental health.

M: I told you it was going to be fast and why. If you weren't serious about applying or able to commit, you should have said something in the first place. I told you what the job was and I'm sure you'd be mad if someone did this since you get mad when friends flake. This affects my reputation with my admin staff. If you had so much going on, you could have reached out and said you wouldn't be able to apply in a timely manner so I could let my boss know. I wasn’t mad at you, just expressing my frustration. I'm kind of mad now because I feel like you're just making excuses. If your mental health is so precarious that you couldn't work this type of job, I wish you would have just said you weren't able to apply.  
   
 

J: Ok fuck you. Your'e honestly being a dick. I'm not hurting my mental health for a shit paying temp job.

M: Then you shouldn't have agreed to apply.

J: I'm not talking to you about this, you're unreasonable and need to chill."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bzfe6c	2019-06-11 17:24:48	thrway123421	AITA for getting upset at someone for being 'accidently' racist?	"throwaway

So little backstory. I (19m) come from a poor immigrant Korean family who didn't have much growing up.  We lived in a bad part of town, but my parents worked their asses off to put me in to private school. I faced a lot of racism from entitled rich western people who knew I was poor, and would make fun of my asian complexion, I was called chink and all the other bad stuff like zipperhead and what-not. The area I grew up around didn't recognize any asian race besides China, so whenever people misplace me in the wrong ethnic group, it brings back flashbacks of the past, and I get a little upset.

A couple of days ago, I came across some young lady, maybe about 17-18 working in a trendy clothing store, and I was just looking around. She was nice enough, and struck up a conversation. She asked me a lot of questions about my ethnicity, which I thought was strange, but answered with nonchalant subject changers because I wasn't comfortable sharing.

She proceeded to ask me what New Years Holidays are like. She said to me:

""Wow you guys are lucky that you get to celebrate our New Years, and your own.""

I asked her what she meant by that, and she said ""obviously chinese new years..?"" and gave me a look like I should know better.

I told her that I wasn't Chinese, and that I was korean. She laughed and said ""haha, sorry but no big deal right? It's like the same thing...""

I got upset and said it wasnt the same, I didn't yell but I went out of my way to tell her the long history and differences of our races.

She looked at me strangely and opened her eyes real wide and said ""okayyy"" and walked away.

My gf told me I was being an asshole because she didn't know any better, but I don't think its fair of her to assume my race. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzfe2n	2019-06-11 17:24:34	Vogt-Ryan	AITA for helping my father one	"
Growing up my mom, who has been single for 10of the 15 years, has done a majority of the work in raising us but we were still under 50/50 custody and saw our dad every wendsday and every other weekend . Up until the last 4 years our relationship with our mom has been very good.

Fast forward to recently. My mom has been taking my dad to court yearly  for what seems like the past 5-6 years attempting to get more money out of him. He now still pays all his child support as he has always done and pays 100% of me and my brothers college as well as 100% of my middle brothers car insurance. He has also paid for half of my first vehicle when a graduated high school and half of my brothers when he graduated too. Yet she still complains that my father is a piece of shit and dead beat. However he has provided a lot for us and has really stepped up when paying for college. We see him regularly, not as much now as we are at college and have a lot going on in our lives. But we still see him once a week at a minimum. 


Recently my father and step mother have purchased 13 acres of land where they plan to build a house. I offered to go out to the property and help clear the land of brush and weeds using a tractor. 

This morning I woke up and told my mom that I was going out to this property to help my dad clear the land. BAD IDEA! She absolutely lost her mind. She began screaming and saying that I need to get out of her house and go help “that piece of shit and his whore” and many other vulgar things. She then told me that she was going to turn off my phone, cut me from the insurance, and kick me out of the house, granted I pay for all of these services and also pay her “rent” for electricity and water that I use. She then went into saying how some and my brothers never doing anything around the house for her and that she has to do everything her self. Mind you that combined me and my brothers do a solid 12-14 hours of work around the house each week. 

THIS IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY, she then proceeded to wake my brothers up( it was about 8am) and tell them that they are not allowed to be at the house the rest of the summer and that she was also turning of their phones also. She then walks into the kitchen and got even more mad because one of my brothers ate some of the lunch meat she bought. Like a child she then threw the lunch meat, lettuce and cheese on the kitchen floor. By now I was sitting in the living room on the couch confused as to how this exploded to the magnitude that it did. She then comes around the corner with a ceramic coffee mug and throws it at me which thankfully missed my head as it broke and left a fist size hole in the drywall just by where I was sitting


TLDR; went to help my dad. Mom still hates dad after 15 years. Deceides that a reasonable response is to launch a coffee mug at my head.

Meanwhile we’re 4 kids including my half brother, his son, trying to divide stuff evenly. 

Now he wants an AC machine my mom bought when we need it for her house which were now living in and we’re buying as soon as her death certificate is in. It’s 3 floors and he lives in a bungalow and is coming to pick up his huge AC that’s like 20,000 BTU whereas ours are all 3000-5000 BTU.

bzfctf	2019-06-11 17:21:57	Hehling97	AITA for Destroying a few things in my place of work becuase they let a girl go home early?	"Title doesn't do justice, here goes the full story;

I work part time at a small local restaurant. Family owned, nice enough people, and co workers are tolerable. Birthday was coming and I gave 3 weeks advanced notice if I could work the morning rather than the evening/night shift I normally work so I could hang out with family and friends for dinner and such. Manager said sure. Sweet.

Day comes around and I'm working from 6 til around 1:30. It's about 1:15 and we are super busy slammed, but I'm looking forward to going home. Manager comes around to the kitchen and informs me that we are way too busy and needs me to stay later than planned. When asked how long, I got a measly ""We'll see."" 

Time goes by and orders get pushed through. Another 2 hours goes by. All of sudden we all hear a glass break out in the dining room. No biggie, things happen. Well apparently, a little bit of glass found its way into the foot of one of the young female waitresses. Now when I say little I mean, the thing was like a paper cut. Regardless, she completely overreacted and was going on about how she couldn't walk on her foot and she needed stitches and etc. Etc. Manager decides, well that's fine, you can go home and I'll just keep one of the cooks here later to balance it out. That cook ended up being me and I was asked to stay until our closing time of 10pm. 

Don't get me wrong, any other day I probably would have been a little upset but hey, its whatever. However, the fact that in 3 weeks advanced I asked for the shift switch, and to get off at 1:30pm only to be told I am staying the entire 6am-10pm shift, on my birthday when I had already made reservation plans with family and friends? I was livid. I exchanged a few heated words back and forward about how shes even able to go home due to a little paper cut. Things got more elevated and in a stupid fit of rage I knocked over a few things like a microwave and a toaster (both of them breaking) as well as boxes of bowls and lids in frustration. In the moment I didn't care, but 2 days later after things have settled I feel like a huge jerk for breaking that stuff. This morning I was told I had to pay to replace the things I broke, which I'm understanding about.

So, tell me Reddit, am I the asshole in that situation, did I overreact, or was my frustration at how things were handles justifiable?

TL;DR

Asked to go home early on my birthday 3 weeks in advance, was told yes, then the day came and then was told no. Other co worker due to very small injury was able to leave early and was told to balance it I had to stay even far later. Out of anger I knocked over a few things and broke them. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
bzfct9	2019-06-11 17:21:56		WIBTA for insisting my husband wear a helmet when Jump biking/scootering?	"Jump bikes and scooters are ""on-demand personal electric vehicles"" scattered all around town. They are really fun, way cheaper than an Uber, and you don't have to worry about parking. Also, many people, including my husband, feel comfortable using them when they're too tipsy to drive a car. Personally I think that's too dangerous - yes you're way less likely to kill someone else, which is extremely important, but you could still get very injured yourself since you have no protection and you're depending on your own drunken balance. 

But I just let it go, because I can't control him and I do think it's better than driving at least. I'm uncomfortable when he goes out but I try to just not think about it.

But then I recently discovered that he doesn't even wear a helmet. The scooters go up to 15mph and the bikes go 20+ because you can add your own pedaling power to the electric motor. My husband and his friends are biking and scootering in crowded city traffic with no helmets while drinking all night. This freaks me out.

First of all, I love him dearly and don't want anything to happen to him. And then on a more practical end, we have two kids and another on the way. My husband is the main breadwinner - I only work part-time and earn way less than he does. We have great life insurance but no disability insurance. 

I hate that he's doing something so dangerous on a regular basis. He knows this, but I only voiced my opinion once - eloquently and seriously - and then let it go. He said it would be totally weird and silly to wear a helmet and that no one else does it. But it's really bugging me.

WIBTA if I insisted he either wears a helmet or doesn't Jump? I'm not even sure what would happen if I made this demand. Either he would just Uber instead, but be grumpy because it's (a) less fun, (b) more expensive, and (c) slower sometimes. Or, he would just continue to Jump, but then I'd be mad as well as worried. We don't really have the kind of relationship where we make demands or tell the other person what to do very often at all. We usually communicate well, care about the other person's opinion, and reach a compromise we can both live with. But this issue is really important to both of us.

A - Aunt

&#x200B;

There is some context required to know why I would even want this, As long as I can remember at every family event my A, U and C showed up late. Last Friday I had my 18 Birthday and on Saturday my family showed up, my A, U and C were late of course. This time they were much too late and I thought *hm maybe they were just normal late and got in really bad traffic* (this live a few Citys away from us). After they showed up we had coffee all together and talked where I found out why there where this late, when they already knew they where late they stopped to buy some kinda ski helmet for my U. My problem with this was that they **KNEW** they would be late already but they just **HAD** to get that helmet right now (without going to use it in near future). They could have got that damn thing every other day in the following week but no they had to stop and get it then to show up even more late to my 18th Birthday.

&#x200B;

so here come my WIBTA: my A, U and C all have there Birthday really close together and I want to make sure to keep playing PC games so we get there WAY late and if they ask I want to tell them I was still playing Video Games and didn't want to stop just to show up for there Birthday.

bzfc6k	2019-06-11 17:20:46	yoteeeeid	AITA for acting more petty towards a friend in particular?	"I’ve recently become acquainted with a girl who was friends with many people I knew, but she’s honestly the type of person where I would rather not be friends with her if I didn’t have anyone in common with her.

In my view, she’s very aggressive and has very little awareness of others, whether intentionally or not, manipulates others and makes those around her feel like a ‘doormat’. Of course, this is mostly trivial stuff but when I speak to people about it, they notice and point it out.

A particular double standard of hers is contains jokes. She would often make jokes about others that hover between a joke and an insult/complaint, and if you ever try to take it seriously, she’ll just complain about you ‘being too serious’ or ‘missing the joke’. Of course, if any jokes are directed towards her that could target her even in the slightest, she becomes hyper defensive and ‘misses the joke’.

Because of that, I’ve started doing something which could be considered mean and petty. Whenever around her, as soon as there’s a hint of her being either hyperdefensive or cracking a joke which she would get angry about, I start acting really aggressive towards her, as in making the same types of comments and complaints as I’d expect her to make. It makes small interactions kind of tense sometimes.

Two nights ago, she was talking with another friend of mine, and told him that ‘Sometimes, she’s not joking’ in reference to me when talking to her. Normally, this would definitely not be me as I dislike using others as the butt of my jokes, but I’ve just realised that it’s essentially exactly what I’m doing to her (and people surrounding us would laugh along with my joke when I poke at her somewhat toxic nature) but I worry about whether what I’m doing is equally toxic, and also about how she might feel as a result of what I say/do."

So, I’m a 22 year old pre-everything closeted trans woman. My friends/roommates (we’ll call them K and T) and I have been planning on moving out of our small midwestern town to Colorado for some time. Mainly K, myself and two other friends from high school. The two other friends have since moved somewhere else for a better opportunity. K and I have been “trying” to leave for two years now. I say “trying” because it doesn’t seem like K has really been putting in the effort. I’ve tried exploring options, moving out of state with my other friends, moving to a more populous area in the state we’re in, moving on my own and whatnot. It’s always something “oh I hate that state, why go there when Colorado is where we’re gonna end up?”. 

We were supposed to leave at the beginning of summer 2018 and that didn’t happen. Then it was by the end of that year when K lost his job and decided to be jobless for a few months. So needless to say, we didn’t get out. So back in February I said I was gone by the end of summer. That’s the last I heard about it until a few months ago he said “I hope we’re out by the end I’ve summer” so naturally it’s pretty irritating.

So I’ve been applying for jobs and single bedroom apartments/studios in a different state entirely for my own reasons. I have vacation coming up next month and I plan on spending the week there looking for my options. WIBTA if I went off on my own and finally got my life going?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I offered the food I made, she got mad that I am selfish & never think of her and that she doesn’t understand how I only can think of me since she needs food to breastfeed our B.

I had a benadryl to force myself to sleep b/c I wanted the night to go away. I woke up angry & I punched the shower in the am to release anger & woke her up. I feel that I am not appreciated for what I provide for us. I pay the mortgage, health insurance, groceries, utilities, I bought her car, pay for her car expenses. I’ve been patient & feel like my efforts just get shit on b/c she expects me to cater to her after I go to work for the day.

I dont want to say what the surgery is cause my friend uses reddit and I dont want her to feel bad if I'm the asshole after all but it's a super common surgery and while it sucks, almost everyone has had it done. 

Over the weekend a paper I helped coauthor in my bachelor's was published in a major scientific journal (think one of the one word title journals) and it's a big deal. One of the primary authors did a bunch of interviews on the radio, he did an interview with a  fairly major news network (not CNN level but like npr kind of level) and  it's been featured in my department's emails. I've been super excited and I'm not gonna lie, it's all I've wanted to talk about all week but I also dont want to get annoying so I've really only brought it up once or twice, really just waited for other people to bring it up.

My friends never said anything about it in our chat so I decided to mention it and make a small joke about the spam emails I've been getting since it dropped. My one friend kind of dropped a small acknowledgement but then immediately changed the subject to how she was feeling and how bored she was and my other friend didnt even comment. I'm kind of hurt they didnt even offer me a congratulations but I also feel like a jerk cause they've both got important things this week.

 Aita? Should I suck it up or am I justified in feeling hurt.

Edit: I texted my one friend who lives nearby when I found out about it and asked if she wanted to plan dinner but due to poor planning on my part, I realized she was probably getting the text after getting home and didnt respond because she was on pain meds and coming out of anesthesia.

So, I(17F) was at a small party that my friend threw for like 18 people. Everyone there are close friends with each other, and these parties usually end pretty incesty, since we're all disgusting teenagers.   
Usually there's always at least a few people who end up either making out or having sex, and it's almost never the same people.  


Now, my friend and this guy has had a thing going on for a while, and I mean like A WHILE. I've talked to this friend about him, and have had really personal conversations with her about him.   
So, about a month ago they decided to end things completely and go their separate ways. I was pretty drunk at this party and the guy asks me if I want to take his virginity. Me and this guy are friends, and we do have some history from before him and the other girl. I end up saying yes, and we do it.  


Next morning she finds out and is upset. And I mean? I get why she's upset. Kind of. But they weren't ever serious or in a relationship. And it's over. But, maybe it was a step too far that I had sex with him. But, it's also just that. Not that deep.  


She also called me crying the next day, but told me she wasn't mad, but that she probably should be.   


A week later she sees me talking to him at a party and FREAKS out. I didn't even do anything, but now she won't talk to me and a bunch of people are mad at me.   


I don't really get what I've done wrong. This stuff happens all the time, and they were over.

My wedding is coming up in November and the whole process has been a bit of a ride. My parents are devout catholic people, who believe that they can’t even attend a non-catholic wedding. After voicing their opinions we have decided to get the marriage blessed by the church so my family can attend in good faith (grandparents, aunts/uncles, parents all catholic etc). 

About a year ago my oldest sister came out as gay and had been in a relationship for almost 2 years, now three. They get married in September, just a couple of months before ours.

When she told my parents, my dad equated it to her basically dying in his eyes and that she’s been stolen by this girl she’s now engaged to. Needless to say my parents are shocked/angry that their first born child has done this. My parents will still cordially see my sister on her own, but my dad has basically said that her fiancé will never be invited into their home/family events.

My sister came to our engagement party and opted to not bring her fiancé because she didn’t think the timing was right for everything. Her fiancé was invited to the engagement party.

My sister will be in the the bridal party. And if I invite her, I imagine she will bring her new wife to the wedding. 

My parents requested that I be the one to choose to not invite my sisters soon to be wife for my parents sake/comfort.

My fiancé was livid when I told her what was said, as it’s her opinion that a parent should be able to attend their own child’s wedding regardless of their feelings for a single guest. (This is now the second stipulation my parents have put on attending my wedding) That if they choose not to attend my wedding because my sisters wife will be there that it means they’re putting their feelings against her higher than their feelings of support towards me. 

Our wedding is about my fiancée and my happiness, and if we uninvited my sisters soon to be wife my fiancé would be pissed knowing that my parents are only there because my sisters wife wasn’t there. But itfmy parents aren’t there I’m gonna be upset obviously because I want my parents there.

If it was up to me and me alone, I would not invite my sisters fiancé simply because it’s the easiest thing to do to satisfy all parties involved. However, like I said before, if that were to happen my fiancé would then be livid.

Am I the asshole for basically telling my parents to suck it up for a night and put their ill feelings towards my sisters wife under their feelings of support towards me for my wedding day?

I’m not asking for judgment on what my parents believe, I’m simply asking if I’m being a bad son for ignoring my parents/families feelings for those of my fiancé.

Edit: I think I should clarify something due to the amount of confusion I’ve seen.. my sisters fiancé IS invited to the wedding. I AM choosing to ignore my parents feelings for my fiancé."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bzf4me	2019-06-11 17:05:38	UnluckySalamander	AITA to reacting to my stepmother's e-mail	"Father's day is coming up, and we're making plans for me and my siblings to visit my dad and have a nice lunch/dinner.  For the past few weeks, we agreed to meet at his beach house, which is 2 hours away.  A few weeks ago, I asked if I could sleep over Saturday night, since I wouldn't have my son, I had to pick my son up Sunday night from his fathers by 8, so I didn't want to drive 4 hours, and thought since I'd have to leave early, I could spend some extra time with my dad in the morning.  

Background info:  My step mother, in the past, has had issue with us (me and my sisters) using the beach house.  She is very neat and tidy, which is fine, and our relationship with her, has been strained for many years, though I try to keep in civil now as an adult.   For reference, I am 31 years old, so not late teens/early 20's or anything.  I can handle staying at a house without trashing (not that I ever would have)

Last night we got a text from our Dad saying that he didn't want everyone making the long drive to and from and we could just meet at his house, we all said that was fine.  Today, we got this e-mail from my step mom:

>UnluckySalamander didn’t want to do that much driving to and from the beach in one day. So, we’re changing the venue to our house.  I already brought the beer and hard ciders etc. and my dessert stuff to the beach house.   So, up here at home I have red wine (blend),  porter beers,  Capt. Morgan rum with Pepsi and moon shine on the rocks

Now, in my mind, this puts the blame wholly on me. My Dad was not copied on this e-mail, So I responded (with him attached) that we didn't have to change the venue purely because of me, and I explained my reasons for asking to sleep over.  And yes, part of it was the driving, but a lot of the reason was because I would have to leave so early to pick up my son, and I wanted to spend a little extra time with Dad in the morning.  But to please change the venue back to the beach if this was based purely off me. 

Now I am getting e-mails saying it wasn't my fault, it was My dad and Her decision, because my Dad didn't want everyone driving.  I even got a call from my dad, saying he didn't know why I felt that way, and that it was a mutual decision, which is why he texted us last night.  I just said ok, and he hung up. I didn't change any of the wording in the e-mail (except names and locations) so am I the asshole.  Did I over react?  Or was I right in feeling she was laying the blame purely on me?

Edit:  Someone had asked that I copy my e-mail verbatim, as I did my step moms:
>I'm sorry for the confusion, I had no problem with the drive, I just wanted to sleep over Saturday night since I didn't have (my son). (My House) to (Beach House) is 2 hours each way, and since I would have to leave by 5 o'clock, considering shore traffic, to get (my son) from his father's on time, I was also hoping maybe to get to hang out with Dad in the morning since I would be leaving so early.

>I had even told Dad it was no big deal when I asked if I was able to sleep over, if I were not welcome to.

>The message from Dad yesterday seemed to imply Dad didn't want everyone making the drive up and back on the same day, which is why I responded the city was good. If the change of plans were hinged solely on me, and you have all your supplies for fathers day already at the shore, and you just were uncomfortable with me sleeping over, we can move our day back to the shore."

For example: one year we were picking out my cake (I had to pick from the clearance section at Walmart while she had her cake custom made) and I wanted my favorite, a carrot cake, but was willing to settle for coconut cake. However she threw a fit at this and would not let up until our mom caved and got a chocolate cake with German chocolate frosting (I despise chocolate cake,and only eat dark chocolate)
Keep in mind that she has had a birthday party every year despite the fact I haven’t been allowed one since I was five because it was too “time consuming” (I’m 4 years older).

This year we had coupons for both a water and amusement park and I want to go to the amusement park for my birthday, but she keeps insisting that we either go to the water park or “split up for the day” something I don’t want to do considering the fact that I am never allowed to invite friends, and want to at least spend it with my family (and I’m already giving up getting a cake so that I can go)

I (18F) grew up in a physically violent household with an abusive dad. my step dad somewhat saved us from that situation and helped my mother out of it. i was 8 i believe at the time, and my brother was 3. the violence was mostly directed at my mother and some of it towards me, particularly after they split and we visited him (ordered by court). 

at first, everything was fine. my step dad was good, he was interactive with us and kind, up until my mother’s pregnancy with him. he was always strict, and i’ve been doing a lot of household work since we moved in together. he promised through her pregnancy to treat his child no different to me and my brother, but obviously he did. in recent years (particularly after i started college) he’s became more and more aggressive. he’s a bipolar coke addict, i have mild ptsd and while he’s never hit me, he screams in my face and uses aggressive body language to make it seem like he will. he’s horrible to me and my full brother, and nice to my half brother (who i love to bits, and is very protective of me). he demands we do all the cleaning in the house and nothing is ever good enough for him. cleaning and babysitting has came in the way of my college work and affected my mental state and grades. 

my mother loves him and has always been abused by men, and doesn’t see much of an issue with his attitude, and follows his theory that my brother and i are to blame. i’m seen as a problem child (i’m not at all) and name called etc. the past few weeks have been very hard, the cat i raised from being newborn died. on the day i buried him, he started an argument with me, so i went to my boyfriends house. i came home the next week, and he physically prevented me from leaving the room, forced me to sit down so he could scream in my face and tower over me, calling me a “selfish, sarcastic, lazy little cunt”. 

my mother is still sticking up for him somewhat, but wants me to buy him a gift this sunday as he still saved us from an abusive household and was a good step dad sometimes. i don’t want to do it, as i’m still staying at my boyfriends and i’m terrified of even going near him. WIBTA for not buying him anything, even though he was nice sometimes? 

Tl;dr, my step dad is verbally and emotionally abusive but saved me from a violent home, i don’t want to buy him a gift for father’s day."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzez4b	2019-06-11 16:54:46	Princess_Siren	AITA for pretty much accusing my boyfriend of taking my pain medication?	"I had a surgery pretty recently, yesterday in fact, and they prescribed me hydrocodone for the pain. When I got home my boyfriend gave me half of one, and then several hours later he gave me the other half until my Mom came home to dole them out for me and so that she could take him home to take care of his dog. 

This morning, when my Mom came in to give me my medication, she told me to talk to my boyfriend because my container was short six more than it should’ve been and she was concerned my boyfriend took some. He used to have a drug addiction with pain pills and says he’s clean now, but my Mom is concerned he may have taken the pills since she understands it can be hard for addicts to be around it. 

I told her if he did take some it was probably for his super sick Mom who has severe chronic pain, and I told her I’d ask him. I was upset though, because I was worried, too, and I asked if he took six of my pain pills with him. 

He got really upset that I accused him and said no, and that I could give him a drug test if I was so worried, and that he doesn’t take hydrocodone in general because it makes him incredibly sick. I said I wasn’t necessarily accusing him, and asked if maybe he took some for his Mom, and he said he didn’t and that maybe the pharmacy didn’t fill it up all the way because he did not take them.

I said okay, my Mom was just worried because of his past and he told me what was new before saying that I should ask before next time accusing him.

bzex4q	2019-06-11 16:50:55	Kathend1	AITA for telling my wife she should skip her mom's birthday, and visit her two weeks later, in order to save $2200?	"Long story short, wife's family lives in a foreign country, it's and expensive and long trip to go visit them.

Due to the timing of our finances, we have been unable to purchase the tickets until now. If she buys the tickets that will allow her to be there for her mother's 55th birthday (major celebration, restaurant reserved, MC hired, whole 9-yards) it will cost around $5200. If she waits for 2.5weeks to go, the tickets will be $3000.

We have been living paycheck to paycheck since the last trip  overseas because of the financial burden. We are finally at a point we can put some money away, and make smarter financial decisions and my wife refuses to see that, instead insisting that she HAS to be there for the party.

AITA?

Edit: there's a lot of claims regarding the $4000 gift mentioned being spent on non-trip related things means we're both assholes in the comments. I'll copy/paste a reply I wrote to a recent one:

But it really doesn't.

The timing of payments vs. timing of emergent situations meant that we had no paycheck money to cover the costs, so rather than make the situation even worse by not paying for it with gift money, even though it was available, I decided to use the money, knowing that I had a paycheck coming that could cover our regular needs +emergent situations (so more than the gift $ spent). 

The problem we are facing is, we couldn't buy the tickets until 2 criteria were met:

1) We had approved visas and passports in hand. (It is a major financial risk to buy the cheaper non-refundable tickets before you have legal access to your destination)

2) We had enough money to cover the cost of the flights.

To the first, we did not receive the passports till a week ago meaning we couldn't buy the tickets until then.

Due to the use of the gift money earlier in may, our account  couldnt cover the cost of the tickets until I received my most recent payments. 

I'm essentially paid on a monthly basis due to the nature of the companies I am contracted with.

This month the payments were postponed by forces beyond my immediate control, meaning I didn't get paid until yesterday.

When we proceeded to check tickets out last night I realized a flight that gets us there for the party her mom planned (after the gift was given, as before that, we didn't even consider going this year) would cost us $5200..

On the other hand, if we waited till July 11th we could save $2200. This money could go towards paying off other debts we have, or even making the 6-week trip more comfortable. This is a larger than normal paycheck for me, so I jumped at the idea of removing some debts.

I can see where she's coming from: ""We technically can afford to pay to be there for the party, and since Mom put so much effort into it, we should.""

My perspective is: ""We've been struggling for a while, and have minimal savings for emergency situations, so we should try to save money where possible, and this is a grand opportunity to save a good chunk of money, and still see her family.""

I was pretty angry when I wrote this post, now that I've cooled down, and she and I have talked about it, I don't feel so certain that it's a horrible idea, and can understand why she wanted to spend the money..

The compromise was that I would skip the party and go later to save *some* money, while she and the boys get to be there for the party. The boys are the real stars of the party apparently, I was unaware of this until she told me today.

I do still wish we could have saved more money, but I often weigh the value of $ vs the value of genuinely beneficial life experiences for my kids... Since they couldn't fly their alone, it made the most sense to send them with Mom and give me an opportunity to knock out a few more contracts before the trip."	Not enough info	0	0
bzex1i	2019-06-11 16:50:44	Which_Candy	WIBTA if we limit interaction with our in-laws because of their views on our parenting?	"I'll try to keep this concise and not give too much bias 

In short, we have raised our kids in an environment where nudity isn't as taboo in our house. We let them play outside naked or stay naked after baths or showers if they want to. We don't force this on them and it is entirely their choice. For example the other day my youngest asked if she could play outside and I said yes and she ran to the backdoor, took off her dress and folded it on the chair by the door and then ran out to play in the sprinkler 

We also took them to a clothing optional beach on vacation recently. We made sure to read reviews and even called a local nudist resort to make sure it was family friendly and of repute before visiting. Our kids greatly enjoyed our days there and actually moved some things around to go more than the one time because they wanted to go back

Now, we don't teach our kids that this is a dirty secret that must be hidden, but they understand that many people don't understand this view and they know not to just tell anyone

But my youngest is a bit of a blabber and told my in-laws about the beach when they were at their house for a day.

Since then, they have confronted us on this and overall been very condescending and passive aggressive over this and even made comments toward our kids that contradict what we are trying to teach them and we can tell it's been bothering our older kids. 

Would we be assholes for cutting them our or limiting their exposure to the kids? We are trying to make sure they are raised with a healthy body image and mindset and are concerned that these two who are authority figures to the kids saying such different lessons to them"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

This actually happened several years ago when I was working as a server in a restaurant and want to know if IATA in this situation. 

I was driving to work for my lunch shift and noticed a man at the intersection with a sign that said he was hungry and anything helps. I stopped and told the man I didn’t have any money to give, but I would be happy to buy his lunch if he came to the restaurant I worked at. He showed up a couple hours later, and we were pretty slow. I offered to have him sit in my section, but he asked to sit at another table (that seats 6) in another server’s section. I got his drink order and gave him a menu. During this time, the host sat me with a table of 5. I went to find the other server and explain the situation and offer to have her take the table of 5 since the guy sat in her section. When I went to talk to her she immediately got defensive and asked why I was waiting on the guy in her section. I explained and told her to take the table of 5. Granted, I did get a bit snippy with my response because of her attitude. She still was upset with me, refused to talk to me, bad mouthed me to the other staff, and then gave the table of 5 bad service because she was in a bad mood. The man was at her table for about 30 min then left. She also had several other tables open and was sat after taking the table of 5. My question is, was I really the bad guy here?

bzevfe	2019-06-11 16:47:35		AITA for not agreeing that Tic Tac Toe is a hobby?	The controversy began about two months back while playing Scategories. My friends are I are all a bit competitive. Letter T, category: “hobbies”, so triple points were at stake. Tic tac toe. I vetoed and the person who wrote it down was somehow flabberghasted. We were playing in a group of 7- after a kind of close vote and putting my foot down that tic tac toe should get zero points in the hobby category (there was talk that it could count for one point, but I firmly stated that in my eyes that one point would be given out of sheer pity and because the person who wrote it was throwing a bit of a temper tantrum.) After the vote, the tic tac toe hobbyist refused to continue playing. It was uncomfortable and annoying. Since then, some people have texted me saying that they think tic tac toe may actually qualify as a hobby and we were being unfair. I believe it is not a hobby and acting like a baby after being voted down is more of an offense than maybe being jilted a point or three.

I have been dating my partner for 5 years, we have thrown around the idea of getting married in the next two years for a while now but I really don't want a wedding. I would like to elope and have the ceremony with only two witnesses, and then have a small party with a few close friends afterwards. My partner is ok with this decision because we both aren't bothered about the actual wedding, just the marriage part. 

The problem is when it comes to our families. Without going into any heavy details, I had a turbulent and abusive upbringing, my mother and I aren't currently speaking and I have a terrible relationship with my maternal grandparents. My dad is just as bad and both sides of my family absolutely hate each other. They're all alcoholics and I have no faith in them to be civil for a few hours at a wedding, even though they say they would. Every family event ends in drama even if everyone likes each other and I don't want to be on edge all day about a day that's supposed to be about me and my partner. I've gone through every scenario in my head and I just can't see it working out. 


So that's why Im thinking about eloping and not telling anyone. I think the more intimate ceremony will be better for the both of us. There will be no family at the reception, only our friends. 

But when I was explaining this to my friend she said that it's unfair to my nicer family members if I exclude them and only invite friends. And that my partners family will be just as upset to not be invited and it will drive a wedge between us, especially with my future mother in law (shes problematic in her own way). She also mentioned that my Grandma, who I'm very close to, would be heart broken. I don't think she would, she understands that my family sucks and I think if I explained to her she would understand. 
She then went onto say that my dad would be broken up about not being able to walk me down the isle as I'm the only daughter he has that speaks to him still.

I've tried to explain that we will be having a ""proper"" wedding later in our lives when we are ready, but right now we just want to be married and have a small and low stress day.

bzesce	2019-06-11 16:41:22		WIBTA if I didn’t get my dad a Father’s Day gift?	"Backstory: my mum and dad separated when I was around 5 y/o. During that time my dad would still make effort to be a good parent.

I was a difficult teenager and didn’t get along with my mother around the age of 16, so I lived with my dad for a few years and for the most part, it worked out okay. He was always quite harsh and strict about things and would impose the whole ‘I’m the adult/parent and what I say goes’ basically, respect was a one way street. I was mostly scared of him as a parent so I didn’t argue back. 

A few years later I moved out and got my own place. My dad would barely make effort to see me or keep in contact with me, he was always pretty awkward about things but I don’t think that should be an excuse. When me and my sister did see him, it would involve coming over to his place and having dinner with little conversation and him mostly looking at his phone. 

We had a bad argument one day over something he said that I found offensive, I questioned him about it and he absolutely lost it. He couldn’t seem to accept me questioning him when he was used to me just obeying everything he said when I was a child. He recited the whole ‘don’t talk back, I’m your parent’ kind of thing and I didn’t stand for it. He was insulting and threatening me and I told him that I’m an independent adult now, not a child and I’ll stand up for myself if I’m being disrespected 

We didn’t talk for almost a year after this, he blocked my number and told family members that he didn’t like being ‘spoke to like that’ by his own daughter. Even though I was in the right - I tried contacting him and apologising to avoid losing our relationship over something so minor, but it didn’t work. Over the year, my family tried making him see sense and how he’s in the wrong. Eventually he wasn’t even mad about the situation anymore and wanted things to be normal again. Unsurprisingly, he still didn’t make any effort. 

We’ve only texted a few times and seen each other once in person since then, things seemed to be okay but still distant. I went on a city break last month and he told me he wanted to gift me some travel money, I assumed this would be in person, but he just sent the money via PayPal. I’ve not heard from him since returning. 

Father’s Day is this Sunday and I will be getting my grandad (his dad) a gift as he is extremely supportive and we keep in regular contact with each-other. But I don’t think I’m going to get my dad anything from how this whole situation has went. My gran (his mother) thinks I’m an asshole for this. The rest of my family agree with me.

bzep8r	2019-06-11 16:34:41		AITA for not wanting to financially support my wife’s family?	"My wife and I have been together for several years total. We come from the same immigrant background, but due to different circumstances, I grew up in a much more financially stable household than she did. I recognize that I’m incredibly fortunate that my parents were able to provide for me in a way where they could educate me about financial literacy and savings. My wife grew up with a lot less, so family from the old country occasionally sent her parents money to help. Once my wife and her siblings were adults, things evened out a bit and they would send money back to the old country in turn.

My wife and I moved in together before we were married, when I started my career and she was working. I made a very good living in a demanding job; I paid rent in a city with high housing costs, and she paid for utilities and groceries. She occasionally used part of her earnings to send money back to the old country.

Last year, my wife began a graduate degree. However, she found the strain of studies and a full-time job to be too much, and wanted to quit her job. I agreed; I would support her fully so that she could focus on school, which means I now cover all of our expenses. In order to finance school, my wife will have taken out six figures in loans. At the same time, I try to put money aside into my 401(k) and into a savings account to buy a house one day.

Last week, my mother-in-law tells my wife that her grandmother called from the old country, crying about how she has no money. (My mother-in-law’s brother—my wife’s uncle and the son of the grandmother—lives near the grandmother and has supported her financially for decades, but has apparently pulled back some.) My mother-in-law asked us for a few hundred dollars. This made me uncomfortable. Between the uncle, mother-in-law and my wife’s siblings, I feel like the financial responsibility for my wife’s family should be carried by them, not me. I am worried about a slippery slope—if I were to give the money now, would it create an expectation to do it periodically, and would it extend to other family members when they say they need money? My wife grew up accustomed to this kind of intra-familial support and feels bad that she can’t provide for her grandmother. I understand that, but it’s not about the amount of money this one time. We fought a lot.
My brother-in-law finally interceded, reassuring us that he would handle it and that I should focus on providing for my wife and our future.

However, yesterday my wife said she still wanted to give money to her grandmother. I disagreed. Eventually, I came to this compromise position: if my wife wanted to get a part-time job (something she’s wanted to do for a while now) those earnings to her family, I would be fine with that. I don’t want to work a grueling job not only to support my wife, but also her family. This precipitated a horrific argument; she told me I’m selfish, want to hoard money, don’t care about her family, etc. I disagree strongly.

He's not *my* friend, he's *hers.* I don't want to drive some person around that I've never even met before. I would already be doing Uber if I was comfortable with that. And in the few minute interaction we had, I already know he makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to be some tiny, girl in a car with a middle aged man, who creeps me out to begin with, alone, then wait for him to be done with his dentist appointment which is laughably far out of town. She should be the one driving this person around, not me, and just because she can't (she's such a bad driver that she got her own license suspended) that doesn't mean she should be volunteering *my* time without my knowledge. I asked why he couldn't just call an Uber, a Lyft, a taxi, an actual relative, anything else, since he very clearly has a smartphone and knows how to use it.

I just don't understand why a person would make an appointment if they didn't have a guaranteed means of getting there, and had to involve a stranger, who unlike Ubers, Lyfts, and taxis, *isn't going to get paid to take the time out of their day to drive some rando around.* And she's trying to tell me how I'm a piece of shit kid for not wanting to do it, but like...

"So this is kind of ridiculous because it’s centered around a hypothetical. But I’m 19 and a full-time college student out-of-state, and have a sister who’s 15. One time I was home for break and somehow while discussing death with my family, the hypothetical question came up about my dad somehow passing. I casually said, “well, (sister), I guess you’d be living with (relatively close aunt) then” (our mom isn’t in the picture).

My sister didn’t really say anything and didn’t care, but my dad got so mad and said that no, it would be my responsibility to “step up to the plate” and support my sister. I said I wouldn’t drop out of school to do that, especially when I’d hardly be able to support even myself. He got even more upset and threw around more phrases like “being a guy”, “stepping up to the plate” and other dumb macho-man stuff.

It was just a dumb hypothetical question so I didn’t say anything and just let it go, but AITA?

TL;DR: If he were to die, my dad would expect me to drop out of college, pick up a dead-end job, and fully support myself and my 15-year-old sister because it’s “being a guy” and “stepping up to the plate”, despite other adults being present in our lives. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"For backstory the house next door is owned by a bit of a self-righteous dude who owns a bunch of other houses around the area. There isn't a lot of room between the two houses, maybe 15 feet from house to house, and the people who rent from him are incredibly nice. The owner, though, has been a bit of a bag of dick tips since he bought the house when it was a foreclosure.   


When he redid the basement apartment, he had a backhoe between the houses tearing up the sidewalk, but in the process, he didn't replace the whole sidewalk, only a stretch of it and he completely screwed up the drainage between the two. He also cut my hose three times and never offered to replace it, peed on my snowball bush because he had no water in the house and poured the extra concrete onto the rocks next to my house.   


Currently, he's re-roofing and he has parked an old farm truck to catch the shingles and such, between the houses with half of the truck on my yard, which will further screw up the drainage. He never said a word about it, never was neighborly to say ""Hey, AreChar, I'm going to reroof, can I park between the houses?"" To which I probably would have said yes, but he just did it, without a peep. So, WIBTA to say ""Could you please move the truck off of my yard?"""	Not the A-hole	0	0

I had four tickets. One for me, one for my mom, one for my dad and one for my 22-year-old brother.

But since my brother said that he didn't want to come, I gave his ticket to my favourite grandma who practically raised me (bless her heart).

This did not sit well with my mom, because my dad may not want to come if she's there. I frankly don't give a shit wheter he's there or not as you can see based on his personality in my raised by narcissists post.

She basically told me that I gave no right to choose who's going to be there because I'm still a minor (which is her excuse for forcing me anything she doesn't want to) and that what I did was wrong and I should've spoken with her and my dad first.

Mind you, my dad only dislikes my grandma because she voiced her controversial opinion on Facebook about a year and a half ago.

bzebss	2019-06-11 16:03:48	badonkathink	AITA for denying my mom her lifelong dream of visiting America?	"I recently (less than half a year ago) got married to an American. It was arranged so the first few months of living together post marriage was pure hell (we knew each other for just 3 months before we got married). And slowly but surely we have come to accept each other and I honestly didn't ever think I'd love this man so much. 

Anyway I'd wager we've been truly a couple for maybe 3 months now. I'm leaving the country next month so I can focus on my medical license exams and won't be back for at least another year. He is very busy with work and can't take time off to visit me in my country. Naturally we are trying to enjoy every single second we can spend with each other right now. 

A few days ago, my husband got a voicemail at 3 in the morning from my mother. She basically just told him that she's coming over this week. That's it. No discussion.  Didn't ask if it was okay. She just booked the tickets. It was greatly upsetting because it seemed like we were just some resort in America that stays open all year and she (along with my sister and bro in law) booked tickets for her to come without consulting with us. I told them off instantly. I was beyond furious because I had politely told them a month ago that it would not be okay for us if she visited now. My sister and bro in law text me almost everyday and they never once even hinted at the fact that they had taken the liberty of booking tickets for her. Now my mother lives with my sister and they are undoubtedly closer than I am to my mother. My relationship with my mother has been fractured for a very long time stemming from when I was a kid and she was very emotionally and verbally abusive. She has tried to redeem herself since then so I'll give her that. I have never taken her to be a good person at heart. But she has been trying. 

Anyway after a lot of crying and fighting they decided it wasn't worth the trouble and cancelled the ticket. They also seem to have cancelled any ties with me. My sister outright told me that I'm an ungrateful daughter since it's honestly been my entire family's dream (like a lot of Indians) to visit the U.S of A. I'm just trying to savor what little time I have left with my husband. And I really want them to know it's disrespectful for them to not consult with us beforehand.

I don't know why, I'm not gay, I have a girlfriend, but whatever that's beside the point. So whenever the group of our friends hang out, typically me a guy, and 5-6 other girls we will take pictures. The problem for me sets in when they want a picture of just the girls. Now if there were four other guys with me I'd understand a bit more (even though I think it's still weird with the segregation) so that the guys could take a picture too. However I'm the only guy, so when they request a picture of just the girls it's basically saying in a nicer way, ""hey I want a picture without him"". These people are basically pretty much my only friends and I find it kind of hurtful when they request this. To me it would basically be akin to spying hey I want a picture without the gay girl, or hey lets do an only skinny person shot, let's not include her shes the only ginger, shes the only black girl here let's get a picture of only the white people, let's get a picture of only the atheists when theres only one religious person. I know those may sound more extreme but I think like its along the same line, like why does any of it matter? Why cant we just have a group picture of friends because we are.

bzeakw	2019-06-11 16:01:08	ihatefilialpiety	AITA for demanding equal treatment from my dad who is discriminating against me because I’m a girl?	"I have 2 older brothers, 30 & 28. We belong to a somewhat traditional chinese family and my dad has promised (I assumed) all his kids one house after they get married to start their family. 

Me and my siblings were sent to America to pursue higher education. My 1st brother went back to our home country, got married and got his house. The house was my dad’s property he was going to sell but was given to my brother as a wedding gift, so technically no additional expense was spared. 

My 2nd brother has been pressured to get married and is now thinking of getting engaged. But my dad is in the middle of a lawsuit and for the past few years have been using all of our resources to win thus can’t afford a house. Especially since 2nd brother decided to stay in LA which is much more expensive than property back home. We are also now in debt because of this lawsuit but are managing pretty well, we just can’t buy property left and right. 

All this wedding talk made my parents joke about me getting married off too. I’m only 19 and i do have a bf but my parents disapprove because he’s white (but that’s another post). I said I’d get married if they bought me a house in London because I’m moving there for post grad but my dads response was “You’re a girl, you’re not getting one. I’m getting your brother a house because its a mans obligation to provide. Just date someone richer or work harder for your first house”. I was livid because it was quite discriminatory of him I accused him of being a pig and he said “I have debts to pay, if I don’t I’d buy all my kids 3 houses each. But you’re a girl so you’re not really a priority in this scenario since u can just marry a man who provides well”

I understand that its quite entitled and not a lot of people have my privilege but AITA for demanding equal treatment? Its not like I’m getting married anytime soon so he has time to resolve his debt.

Edit 1: I am not from China, I’m ethnically chinese but was raised in a much more conservative country. Though the concept of gender equality is not new to me as I went to an international school so it -somewhat- promotes free thinking rather than gender norms

My 2nd brother is not getting a house yet, he has demanded my dad pay for his & his wife’s rent until my dad can afford a house for him in LA

And lastly I understand how people might think this is a validation post as my dad is painted as a villain here, I just felt confused if i was TA or not because my parents have been treating me like I haven’t been grateful for all the privilege I grew up with.

We're looking at names at the moment and are floating a few options. We haven't met the cats yet (viewing this evening). The cats are 9 months and are both female.

I would like to name them something similar to Zelda (no issues) and Dave, because it's a funny name for a cat, and this would be the case whether they were boys or girls.

My partner has flagged that this may be offensive or insensitive to the LGBT community and I can sort of understand why but it could also be overthinking. So i wanted to ask for opinions. I hope that's ok. If anyone even finds it a little uncomfortable, it's no longer a funny name and it will of course not be named something insensitive :)

A: friend 1
B: friend 2
C: friend 3
D: friend who's in the hospital 

I left class my auto class right after lunch started,  walking with A and B. Along the way I rememeberd I had wanted to fix the wheels on my skateboard so I told them to text me where they would be and I'd join them in about 10 minutes. 

Anyways after  about 15 minutes I had fixed the issue and checked my phone. No text. I walked around their normal spots and couldn't find them. So I called another C. 

Me: Hey where are you guys

C: Oh we're on our way to the hospital oh but don't worry we're all okay. D  is there she didn't pass out though. 

A gets on the phone and tells me that D had some heart problems or something and got removed from class and taken to the hospital. 

C: Yah so we all decided to go keep her company and skip our next classes. 

I just said ""oh okay bye"" and hung up. Im kinda upset that they all decided to go see our mutal friend without telling me about it. And that they all knew this happened and nobody told me. I feel bad being pissed at them but this isn't the first time they've just neglected to tell me what's going on. In my mind  all they needed to do was shoot a text like ""Hey D is in the hospital, we all want to go see her. You in?""

bze7ym	2019-06-11 15:55:27	throwaway89942	AITA for wanting to play games with only my son sometimes?	"I  am a father to one boy (14) and one girl (9), and I play games with  only my son every so often. We play on his PS4 for a few hours, talk  about anything that comes to mind, and generally have a good father-son  bonding time over a hobby that we both enjoy. Recently my little girl  has been trying to join us whenever we have these impromptu ""sessions"",  and quite frankly I've been denying her from playing with us during  these times. This is because if his sister is around, my son finds it  hard to talk to me about anything private or embarrassing he's dealing  with that he wants help or advice with and he has told me that he finds  it more relaxing when we have some alone time together.

&#x200B;

For  some additional context: no, this is not the only time members of our  family play games together. We have a Nintendo Switch, and on a lot of weekends all of us play multiplayer games together and have a lot of fun. My son  freely gives his PS4 for the rest of us to use, so my daughter plays on  it sometimes, and I've played games with all of my kids or even just her  on multiple occasions if they ask me although I do not make it as much  of a priority as I do playing with my son. Of course, I feel a bit bad  when I tell her no, so I do go to her the  day after and ask if she wants to play some video games or do something  together, which we may or may not do depending on her mood.

&#x200B;

Before  you all call me sexist, I would just like to explain my reasoning. My  daughter currently has a great relationship with her mother, going out  together frequently and bonding a lot. Of course, I do a lot of things with my daughter as well, but I would say  that it is fairly clear that she has the greatest connection with her  mother. This is something that is to be expected, and she loves me a lot too. However, my boy, being the  moody teenager that he is, somewhat pushes his mother away and I can see myself in him. Growing up, I was raised by a single mother with two  sisters. I remember during my teenage years, my sisters got closer to my  mother while I got further. Due to this, I still can remember the sense  of isolation and longing for a close father figure. I want to give him what I didn't have, so I've been making a bigger effort to connect with him for the past few years.

&#x200B;

Recently  my wife has told me that excluding my daughter from our games can make her quite lonely, and that I should be including her next time. I  explained all of my reasoning detailed above, and that I since I do  spend a lot of time with her, I should at least be given some time  to bond with my son alone. She snapped at me, telling me that it was  irresponsible of me to give the extra attention to my son, and that I  should be treating them equally. I'm kind of at a loss as to what the  right or wrong is, so I would really appreciate a third opinion.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Hey all, thank you a lot for your opinions about this situation. After reading through a lot of the comments, I've realized that there's some key information and context that I either forgot to include, or deleted to keep it under 3000 words. I do, in fact, spend time with my daughter alone. I cut out a more detailed description to follow the word limit, but I do spend time with  my daughter when playing games, going shopping, and going on walks and  all sorts of other things. Some people interpreted it as I choose to only spend 1-1 time with my son, and that I am willfully neglecting quality time with my daughter. This is simply untrue.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I don't exclude my daughter purely out of my own biases or whatnot. This  is something that I do as a result of talking to my son about it,  wherein he explicitly expressed his desires to have some time with me  alone to talk about his problems. When I do things with my daughter 1 on  1, there is no reason to exclude my son as my son usually does not want  to go with us despite me trying to convince him, and my daughter is perfectly happy if her brother comes along. 

&#x200B;

When I tell her no to joining the conversation between my son and I (the game is just a vehicle which makes the conversation easier to carry on), I do explain to her very gently that this is the only  time where my son and I want some time to just ourselves, that we are discussing things that her brother wants to say to me privately and that she is welcome to come to me with things she wants to do any other time.  

&#x200B;

However, I did realize that my view on the nature of parent-child relationships was greatly skewed by my childhood experiences, and now I know how damaging it could potentially be. I will try my best that I build the foundation of an open, loving relationship with my daughter for when she enters her teenage years so that she can have honest dialogue with me as well, instead of simply relying on my wife to be her primary adult figure."

Today i watched Square Enix's E3 Conference, for one reason: ""The Avengers game"".

To be honest i was kinda down when they didn't show direct gameplay (i know some scenes looked like it was gameplay and the trailer was made in the same engine as the game with the same resources), And if you have seen last EA'S E3 you know what i mean. (I'm looking at you command and conquer Rivals)

so i decided to go to a comment section in a trailer video, to share my opinion and see if others have the same idea. surprisingly yes and cue the problem.

&#x200B;

**The problem**

You see every community has: "" that guy "" the one who says don't be like that, then proceeds to say I'm doing better than you, and be like me. (with all my respect to everybody)

This is the original comment someone posted, and the tantrum begun [here](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185519980572).

The guy that i ran in trouble with let's call him hank (not his username nor real name because i don't know him i just made the name up for easier referencing.) this was his [response](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185520033872), And i jokingly said [this](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185520125837).

but his response kinda threw me off, [here](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185520178412). It was mean for someone who just commented, i understand sometimes people just have a bad day and they spill their frustration on other people, but calling me toxic and that i throw people of the game that they are exited for ?

Woah that is a whole another level, so i responded with [this](https://66.media.tumblr.com/50512ee62d61c89928f8fae71f7815f8/tumblr_psxx0j6zwE1wxl0rwo1_500h.jpg).

now if you read this you notice i talk about someone who is named: ""SkiDzz"" (not his full username) well this guy commented on hanks first opinion about the original comment and said [this](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185520394562). and hank replied back to him like [this](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1979ec6f0c1e8f924d1876655e1f260d/tumblr_psxxdwEv1e1wxl0rwo1_500h.jpg).

and hank didn't stop here he got to another person and criticized his opinion after my last reply to him, which he didn't answer *Wonder why* ;). (let's call this guy John) so this was john's reply to hanks first massege, [here](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185520543047). and here is Hank's [reply](https://ninjamortal51.tumblr.com/image/185520577967) to John.

And another person replied to Hank's first massege, [here](https://66.media.tumblr.com/88360b221a423bbc4b9c740314556746/tumblr_psxxvn5hoL1wxl0rwo1_500h.jpg). and hank yet to reply to this comment.

&#x200B;

Now i just what to ask: AM I THE ASS HOLE or you can say: The idiot here ?

And  i do Not think I'm the right one i just want to know if i behaved in a right manner ?

or I'm the asshole. and please comment your thoughts on the situation in a manner way and in a technical way about the subject in the first place."		1	0

The classroom i’m in for one of my classes is freezing, enough for me to be constantly shivering, and there is no way to turn on the heat. Because of that, I began bringing a non uniform sweater to school that i wore throughout the day, and no one had a problem with it except for my teacher in this class, which sucked because that was the only class i needed it in. When i wore it she told me to take it off. So i did because those are the rules, until i realized that she would only say it when i was wearing my sweater. She lets people wear their sweaters the whole period, and when i would put it on right before class ended, she told me to everyone to not wear them. But only when i had it on. Another time she told me to take it off and said she wouldn’t start the class until people had it off, and while the sweater was on my head in the middle of taking it off she raised her voice at me to take it off. Today i left my sweater in my locker so that she wouldn’t be mad, and people are wearing their sweaters and she hasn’t said anything. Sorry if this is so jumbled i’m writing this fast in class and i’m pretty annoyed, also on mobile.
So Aita if i talk to a vice principal about this? i understand the rule is that you’re not allowed to wear a sweater and i get it could be petty but it’s really annoying to watch her to blatantly let other people wear their sweaters and only get mad at me. I was talking to my friend about it and she got mad saying that she was nice, and that she’s a new teacher so she can potentially get fired, and since the years almost over i should forget about it. Not sure how true that is about the getting fired thing but Aita for planning to report her?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bze5go	2019-06-11 15:49:22		AITA for not wanting my mom to live in my basement?	"So I'm 23 and just bought my first house with some help from my mom. It's a small house, but I don't mind. It's a good starter home. Basically in Canada, you need a minimum 5% of the value of the home for a down payment. I had about 10% but it was still going to make for a high mortgage payment. My mom works overseas, and offered to match my 10% as an ""investment"". Basically whenever I sell the house, I give her her 10% back plus whatever profit I made selling the house. It decreased my mortgage payment by a good amount and it seemed like a fair deal. 

Anyways, the house has a basement and my initial plan was to renovate it and turn it into an apartment, which I would then rent out. Realistically I could be making a profit on my mortgage payment from renting this place out. Now that im saying this, my mom is insisting on moving in as my ""tenant"". She's saying the only reason she invested in my property was so that when she decides to retire and move back to Canada, she can live in my basement. 

I won't lie, my mom and I aren't the closest because she abandoned me to move overseas when I was about 11 when she left my dad. So at this point I told her hell no. I told her I'd gladly return her investment, but she would not be my tenant. She has some pretty bad boundary issues, when she stayed with me when I was in school, I caught her going through my room when I got home from work. She then blew up on me about how I'm ungrateful, and how when I was younger she loaned me money to buy a car (I've paid it all back) assuming that she'd get to live with me when she was older due to her not having a pension.

AITA for not wanting her to live in my basement? She hadn't brought it up before, she just sprung it on me that it should've been ""assumed"""		1	0
bze5g8	2019-06-11 15:49:21	F15sse	AITA for getting mad at my Mom for making me let my sister play my Switch	"TL;DR at bottom.

Some backstory. My family is poor. We are a family of 6 and my mom cant work due to a disability  so growing up it was only my Dad providing. We always got by but we never really nice things like video games.

Growing up every video game i had i bought with money i earnes.Im very protective of my possessions and i dont like other people touching them especially my siblings.

After i got a job i decided i wanted a nintendo switch. Last fall when lets go pikachu came out i decided to get one then. Now my sister who shares my love for nintendo games, espcially zelda, was pretty envious.

Now ive let her play some of my older games and ive given some of my own consoles like my DSi. I knew she wanted to play one of my games and i said if wanted to the rules would be she would have to get her own controller and she could only play docked. For those who dont know the switch is both a home console and handheld. Docked means its plugged in a stand to play on tv. My sister never did get a controller. She always woukd call me an ass when i told her no if she wanted to play.

Fast foward to last Saturday night my dad and mom went out to eat using and i was stuck at home. She asked me again if she could play the switch. This time i was feeling lenient and said only if she paid for pizza. She said sure and i said again, only docked and she has to use the pro controller.

Now a slight problem. Our family only has one tv and its shared. Not to big a deal but my mom hogs it to watch hgtv and hallmark  The problem is my sister wants to play and my mom wants to watch tv. My sister can only play when my mom isnt using the tv. Since she just graduated and was out of school i didnt think it would be a big deal as she has tons of freetime and will have chances here and there.

Fastword again to last night. My sister starts bugging me to let her play on the handheld mode because our mom is watching some movie. She starts to get irritated with me saying no and she starts to complain to mom. My mom who wasnt having it asked me to just let her play it. I said no and at this point my sister was calling me an asshole. Then my mom kinda out of the blue said if you wont share your things i wont share mine and said that if I dont let her play she wont let me use her car to get to work (my car recently broke down). After a some arguing i concede because it was time for me to go bed plus i needed the car to get to work. So i end up letting her use the switch and going to bed angry.

I was thinking about it and just wanted some out side thoughts. Is it too much for me to place limitations on stuff i buy when other people use them? 

TL;DR: After buying a switch my sister wanted to play it. After setting rules for her to play it she insists on loosening the. My mom insists i let her play whenever she wants and if i dont i wont be able to use her vehicle to get to work until i get a new one."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bze4xn	2019-06-11 15:48:05		AITA for getting annoyed at my mom?	"Throwaway here

A couple of weeks ago, I failed my driving test. I was shaken and had lost my confidence, so I told my mom ""Please don't talk about my driving progress with other parents"" (because she always talks about me [18m] with other parents). I felt embarassed about being an adult and being unable to pass the test (I'm not incompetent at driving.. just got flustered too easily), and wanted that stuff under wraps so I can take the time I needed to ass the test without any external pressure.

She agreed, said she wont, and that ""Nobody would even ask her about my driving.""

There was a park picnic she wanted me to attend, and I told her no because I just wanted the day to myself, and I didnt feel like talking to other parents. I made sure to tell my mom again ""Please don't discuss my driving. I dont feel good about myself, and it'd be embarassing if ppl knew I was an adult and didnt drive yet.""

She was talking to a mom that day and I heard her mention my name, so I sat by her and asked (i wasnt angry, just curious) what she said, she said ""Nothing."" Then in the ride home, I asked what she said about me to the other parent and she told me that another mom asked her specifically about my driving, and that she told her ""Oh he's just practicing.""

I didnt blow up or yell at my mom, but I asked her, ""Why did you do that?""

She said that the other parent could interpret this as ""Oh he has his license but hes just practicing,"" but I told her most of the time, if someone says they're ""practicing something,"" it usually means they are learning it for the first time. She just told me ""No.""

I then reminded her how embarassing it feels that she told another parent (and one who talks about other kids to other parents as well, and has a really successful child, someone my mom always compares me to whenever I underachieve) something about me that I didnt want anybody to know about.

I had told her I didnt want anybody knowing about my inability to pass the test, and about my driving progress. She then tried to blame me for this situation by saying I was ""too sensitive,"" said sorry, then basically invalidated her own apology by saying ""All I did was tell them you were practicing,"" or ""you're too sensitive,"" or ""it's not a big deal."" When I tried discussing this with my mom about this, she kept on looking at her phone instead of paying attention, so I went to my room and did my HW. She asked me to take out the trash, but I pretended not to hear, and did it when my dad asked me to.

I get that for her, it may not be a big deal, but my reasoning for not wanting someone to tell anyone else a detail about me shouldnt matter. I feel that if she promised me she wouldnt talk about my progress, she should have honored it.

So my buddies and I all currently live at our respective homes, but we’ve been trying to make plans to get a place for well over a year and some change I’d say. We’ve never pulled the trigger because someone either didn’t wanna commit at that time, or money issues or what not, I’ve been trying to get them to get their butts in gear so we can get a place and I can get out of my home but it always just never happened. Until, i found out recently that they are indeed getting a place, and moving in all together without me and It kinda pissed me off. I wasn’t asked, or anything and they know I’ve been trying to move out for years but I’ve been waiting on them. Am I the asshole for for getting upset in this situation? I’d say these guys have been my best friends for majority of my life and I feel pretty screwed and wished I just moved out on my own instead of waiting for them."		1	0

The mom’s picking up stuff, and the kid is like “mom, we can’t afford this, we don’t have any food at home.” I felt really awkward. I didn’t even have my friend with me because I went into this store alone, so I wasn’t sure what to do. They were like full on fighting, but whispering fighting, and the mom was basically like I’ll buy what I want go sit on your iPad and leave me alone. 

This kid just sat down and started crying it looks like and I felt really bad. But it’s not my place to say anything, and I’m a big fan of staying in my lane, so I just awkwardly left without buying anything because I wasn’t sure what to do or if I should say anything. I thought about giving the kid ten dollars or something to cheer them up, but I didn’t want the mom to yell at me or anything so I ended up leaving without saying anything.

bze2rh	2019-06-11 15:43:10	Blesser_Heart	AITA for not wanting my boyfriend's family over?	"So I (29,F) am a performing artist and an introvert. My boyfriend (30) is an extrovert. 
We live in an apartment together but I'm the only one on the lease and I pay 100% of the rent (over $600) most of the time (he chips in about $100 every now and then and he also pays the electricity bill which is always between $50 and $75). I've begged him to get on the lease too, but he either promised he would do it and never got around to it, or flat out refused because he doesnt think he has to. 

I also have a car that I'm still paying on (with zero financial help from him) but I let him use it freely. 
Well, he messed up and drowned the engine, so now we're carless (I have auditions, rehearsals, gigs on a regular basis, so that's a HUGE bummer for me). 

So he decided to invite his mother to stay with us for a few days without consulting me first. He wants her to be here so he can use her car whenever he needs to. It's convienient to both of us, I get that. But the thing is, the idea of someone else staying with me gives me MAJOR anxiety because like I said, I'm an introvert. I'm at peace when I'm in solitude and that's where I get my writing, practicing, and recording done. 

So I told him that her coming and staying overnight makes me uncomfortable and told him needed to ask me before inviting people over. He caught a MAJOR attitude with me and told me I was being selfish and I didn't care about his needs and wellbeing (cause the reason he wants her to come is so he can use her car). I tried to tell him that I wasn't saying she couldn't come, I was just telling him how it made me feel and asked him to say something to me first, but he wasn't hearing it. 
I really dont wanna be selfish in this situation cause I know how stressful it is for the both of us, but I don't wanna be taken for granted. I feel like since this is my apartment, I have a say so in stuff like that.  So, AITA?

EDIT: His mom is really really sweet. He says she likes me :) and I've never actually had trouble with her. The issue is me, I'm just super super nervous around people and my small humble apartment is my only happy place, ya know?"	Asshole	0	0

She has tried every over the counter pill / supplement to increase her breast size for a few years.  She has also purchased a variety of devices that claimed to increase  breast size but only reduced our bank account.  About 2 years ago she helped her good friend go thru her breast implant surgery.  Her friend was newly single and has a job where they both claimed having larger / fuller breast would result in making more money.  No they are not strippers or escorts or any sex worker crap.  Not even modeling.  Her friend just has a job working around wealthy clients who tend to invest more when distracted, I guess.  

&#x200B;

So now that her friend's surgery is done and she's happy with the results.  My wife wants to do the same.  I can not control her or anything, but when she asked if I would help pay for it I said no.  She makes her own money and could save up for it if she wants it that bad.  I married her because I like her they way she is.  Her boobs are perfect to me already.  Firm, Perky, still defying gravity after years of married life.  I love it when she puts them in face and they are just the right size the way God made them.  She tried to convince me I subconsciously like bigger breast because of how I reacted to the increased size of her boobs when she breast fed our kids when they were babies.  To me that was natural.  I just don't like the idea of her going under the knife for something I think is unnecessary.

I did not had breakfast or lunch that day because I was busy which is why I ordered a whole single pizza for myself.  

I was chilling and dining for about 20 min, and got half way through the pizza, when a really disheveled looking man came into the store. He started approaching customers and asking if they can spare some food, most of the customers of course said no and waved him away. The cashiers truly don't seem to care about this homeless guy bothering customers, but I dont blame them since they make min wage and security guard isn't in their job description.

So eventually the homeless guy makes his way around to my table and notices I had ordered a full pizza and was half way through, he flat out says ""Gimme a slice you don't need the whole thing"", i'm just taken aback by the way he said this. I paid for the meal, and I was definitely intending on eating the whole thing, If I was going to throw away some of the leftovers I would have given it away but I wasn't planning on throwing it away.

So I just tell him ""you're being rude harassing people at a store while they are dining, can you please gtfo and go to a food bank thanks"". The man literally spits at me and calls me a racial slur and then walks out the store. One of the other customers at the store said I din't need to say it so aggressively, but some other customers thanked me and said he was making them uncomfortable.

bzdyzt	2019-06-11 15:34:46	noweddingreception	AITA for not going to my sister’s wedding reception?	"I am South Asian and my family is Muslim for context. My sister and I are not Muslim, but we haven’t (explicitly) said it to our family yet. My sister and I drink and that is not something our family would approve of because alcohol is explicitly prohibited in Islam. 

My sister is marrying a white American male who is not Muslim. She is having a Western wedding reception and a South Asian wedding reception. She is not having an actual wedding, the Western wedding reception is basically a large garden party where she wears a white dress and afterwards she has a a party at a mansion with her friends. She wants to drink at her western wedding reception so she didn’t invite any of our South Asian family except for the people that were okay with drinking (so me + a handful of cousins our age, no older adults). This means my dad was not invited but her fiancé’s family was. Since my dad was not invited and would question why he wasn’t invited, she opted to not tell him.

I don’t want to go to the Western wedding reception because 
a) it’s in some Midwestern state so flight tickets are $400 for one weekend for a large garden party
b) none of my family is going so I’ll know like 3 people there (including my sister and her fiancé) 
c) we’re already having a south Asian wedding reception that I’m going to
d) I feel bad lying to my family and dad like that so it’ll be easier to tell him it’s an event her friends are throwing if I don’t go
e) my sister is going to be surrounded by all of her friends and will be constantly talking to people so we won’t even be interacting that much

However, she said she considers this reception like her real wedding and not the South Asian one and I feel like she would be upset not having me there.

So AITA if I don’t go?

EDIT: I just wanted to clarify really quickly that my sister didn’t talk to my dad for like a year or two because of what he did in the past and how he treated her shittily in the past. They’re talking now, but she didn’t want South Asian family there judging her. The reason I still talk to my dad is because the way I view it, he grew up in an extremely patriarchal society but unlike other South Asian parents, he’s more willing to listen and cares about us and dotes on me and my sister. He’s way more accepting than any other South Asian dude that grew up in his position but he’s still entitled (we call him out on it), still follows Islam and will not condone drinking. I don’t think my sister is TA because I personally view it as cultural differences that can’t really be overcome."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzdynt	2019-06-11 15:33:50		AITA For Not Telling a Customer That We Threw Away Her Father's Ashes?	"Yesterday at work, I had a customer come up to the front desk and ask if we had a lost and found. I told her yes, and asked her what she was looking for. She told me that she had lost a small bottle with her father's ashes in it a couple of weeks ago and if we had by chance found it. I go into the back to search for it and suddenly my memory triggers.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago, my coworker had found a small bottle with a powdery substance in it in our bathrooms. We have a pretty big problem with drug use in our bathrooms and she assumed that there was probably some sort of drug inside the bottle that someone used to shoot up with in our bathroom. We are not allowed to keep drugs in the lost and found, as it may contaminate other lost items, could cause someone to have a serious negative reaction if touched, and is a chemical hazard so she threw it out. I'm not sure how she disposed of it, but it was either in the normal garbage or in our biohazard disposal bin. 

&#x200B;

So now I have two horrible choices on my hand. I can either tell this girl that we threw her dads ashes away and her father is now resting with a bunch of garbage or used needles. Or I can just lie to her and tell her that we never found it. I got advice from my other coworker and she said that she couldn't bear to tell her and that she would just lie to her in my situation. I thought it over for half of minute and decided that I would lie to her. 

&#x200B;

In that situation, I would have personally preferred to have been lied to. I know I would have never forgiven myself if my carelessness had caused my father to be resting in the landfill. I would prefer to have some sense of hope that maybe I will find him one day, or that maybe someone had picked it up and thought it was a neat decoration and took it home with them. I know that a lot of people prefer to be told the truth no matter what, but I personally don't mind and don't think it's wrong to tell the occasional white lie if it's being used to protect someone's feelings.

&#x200B;

I told my boyfriend the story when I got home and he thinks I am a horrible person. He thinks it would have been better if I had told her, because at least the girl would have gotten some closure. He also thinks there's a chance that the girl could track it down and find it, but I personally don't see that as a possibility. It was weeks ago that we found this tiny bottle, and it is either buried under a mountain of trash at the landfill or has been safely disposed of in some sort of processing facility. He has told me that he has lost trust in my ability to make important decisions and has lost a lot of respect for me. AITA?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Customer came in and asked if we had found a bottle containing her father's ashes. I remembered that a coworker a couple of weeks ago had thrown out a similar bottle that matched her description because we assumed it had contained drugs. I decided to lie and tell her that we never found it."		1	0
bzdyfq	2019-06-11 15:33:16	mrscksst8	AITA for attempting to call off work because my car broke down?	"A little background information: 

This morning I get up as usual - shower, eat, make lunch, and troll some reddit. I live really close to my place of employment and always leave 15 minutes before my start time.

I work at a daycare so being present and on time is basically non-negotiable - a really shitty part of the job is that our company does not hire substitutes or have anyone extra on payroll for emergencies. In other-words we are required to work sick, come in during dangerous weather conditions, and are lucky to even get off for a funeral or an important doctor appointment. 

For these reasons I feel guilty as hell to put in any personal time or to call off sick because I let down everyone. Its a lot of pressure for someone - especially me who has severe bipolar disorder and anxiety. I also NEVER call off work and still have all my personal days plus most of my vacation days because I feel guilty just visiting my own family that I try to hook it to weekends so I don’t have to take more than the necessary days off.

Well this morning my car broke down. I desperately tried to get it to work for ten minutes and realized, I am super SOL. I have no family nearby to help me and my husband travels daily for work. We have no other vehicle (besides a strictly monitored work truck) and thus we have no way to get around or even get myself to work for the rest of the week. I tried to call off and my boss lost it.

She told me she thought I had a little more sensibility to call off work five minutes before work and that someone can come and get me for my shift. I am glad someone can come get me but what about the rest of the week? If I had one day off to call triple a get them to tow it to a garage and maybe get a rental car until it can be fixed then I won’t have to inconvenience people for the entire week.

Now my husband has to come home from his job to solve everything - we are gonna lose valuable income (my husband being the bread winner) and probably have to dish out cash we don’t have to either fix and get a rental or buy an entire new vehicle. My husbands entire work crew has to now miss out on an income today to leave the site early. All because my boss won’t let me take 1 unscheduled personal day to get my car fixed.

So reddit, AITA for trying (and failing) to call off work to get my car fixed?

EDIT: People keep asking about uber - this was personal and I didn’t want to share this but I legitimately don’t have any cash due to the way bills pulled out this week and can’t afford an uber. Let alone ubers are difficult to get by my house ( I would have to wait 30 minutes +) My co-worker had already offered to give me a ride. I know our car insurance/triple a will cover the cost of a rental if I need one while my car is being fixed."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzdwu6	2019-06-11 15:29:43		AITA for Not Letting My Mom Smoke in or Near My New Home?	"My mom currently lives outside of the US and is retired. She smokes cigarettes all the time. Even growing up I hated that she smoked. Over the years the whole family started forcing her to smoke outside but that didn’t matter because the smell was still everywhere. No one else in the family smokes except her.

I recently bought a home with the spouse and we moved out of a small apartment. When my mom would visit us at the apartment, she’d smoke outside. Both me and my spouse HATED it but we tolerated it since she’s my mom. I even would ask her to not smoke while she’s here but she’d insist it’s fine since she’s outside. I didn’t push it.

Well now in our new home, which we moved into barely 3 weeks ago, me and my spouse decided we won’t allow her to smoke in or outside of our home. We simply can’t stand the smell and don’t want it in our home. She told us a week or so ago that she’ll be visiting us in a month or so. I took that as an opportunity to tell her that we won’t allow her to smoke. She of course said “that’s fine, I’ll smoke outside.” I told her that we won’t allow it at all. In or outside of our home. Essentially if we smell smoke on her at all, she’s not allowed in our new home. She got quiet but didn’t push back.

Yesterday I called her to see if she needed help buying her ticket. She yelled at me saying I was being condescending and that when she comes she won’t be staying with us and just gonna get a motel nearby and won’t even bother seeing us (she lived in the states a long time so she’d have other people to see).

bzdvf4	2019-06-11 15:26:31	Ayuvelo	WIBTA for choosing career over lover and professor?	"There are 3 parts to this story, but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

&#x200B;

**Part 1**

I'm studying VFX on a small University. It's great and because it's so small, it's very personal, tight-knit community.

I've had a good relation to the head of studies - let's call him Bob - of VFX since I started studying here. Recently, he managed to get a partnership with one of the best Universities in the world and I immediately applied for an exchange semester. After months of planning on all sides, everything seems finally in place. Got the ok on everything, flights are booked, plans are made. I'll be the first to represent my university there and basically test the partnership.

&#x200B;

However, this wasn't the only thing I applied to.

&#x200B;

**Part 2**

2 days ago, I got an amazing mail. I'm invited to the last round of application for one of the biggest and most important studios in the VFX industry. I was happy as could be. It would be a paid 2-month-training in the summer with my own mentor to coach me.

Now comes the bummer. Should I actually get accepted into this training, I'd have to cancel the planned exchange, rendering all the time and effort from everybody useless and possibly worsening the fresh relation between our universities.

&#x200B;

**Part 3**

But that's not the end of it. Last year I met this amazing guy (I'm a guy but bi) - let's call him Joe - while I was on an internship on the other side of the world. We got along well and had some fun time. He'll be close to me because of work soon and said that he'd add a week to his trip so he could visit me. It would be the first time in over a year that we meet again. Everything is planned and booked and we're both super excited. I guaranteed him that it will work out and so we both invested some money into this trip.

&#x200B;

As you might guess by now, the summer training would overlap not only with my exchange but also with our trip. I asked some people from the industry and they said that simply having the name of this VFX studio in my CV is the best thing that could happen to me right now career-wise.

&#x200B;

So... **Would I bet the asshole for choosing the studio over holiday and exchange?**"	No A-holes here	0	0

So there’s one assignment at the end of the semester that’s fairly easy and I remember our professor talked about it at the beginning of the semester which was like a month ago(these are 5-week classes) but not until yesterday was I reminded of it. Now this in itself wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact that this assignment, if we didn’t turn it in, would drop us a letter grade in the class. 

I was looking for the assignment on my class syllabus and I found that it was under class participation and it wasn’t put in bold that we had to turn in this assignment or else it would drop us a letter grade. This bothered me because I feel like anyone taking this class could’ve forgotten about this assignment since it wasn’t really talked about in class all semester except at the beginning and also it wasn’t in bold on the syllabus despite the consequences of it are being dropped a letter grade. So I told my professor that in the future he should put this in bold so students won’t forget. He said that since it was a summer course he had to write the syllabus fast. Looking back, I felt like I was kind of being petty and nit picky. So AITA for criticizing my professors syllabus?

bzdqm5	2019-06-11 15:15:24	throwawaytravelerrr	WIBTA if I don't insist that someone else take that work trip other than me?	"Throwaway because reasons.

I work for one of those big international organizations (think World Bank, UN, IMF, etc.). I joined about a year ago as the only international staff in the team working on a specific project that started about 1.5 years before I came in. Before this job, I worked in the private sector and built a decent network all over the world. As a result, I'd always get wind of and pursue certain opportunities, mostly to boost our visibility, that would have otherwise not been in the radar at all as they're mostly geared toward the private sector too.

I recently pursued one such opportunity by entering our project in a fairly prestigious international contest. It's worth noting that while I wrote the essays and all for the application, I wasn't there yet when the specific project component was implemented.

Long story short, I got the email this weekend that we had won the award. As part of the prize, we were invited to present our project as a ""Best Practice"" case study to a global audience as part of a larger industry conference. Everyone's over the moon about this news as it would not only be awesome for our organization, but this developing country I'm in as a whole. 

Now, this was an unplanned win, which means this isn't in our annual budget. We can probably find the budget for representation, but international organizations are insanely meticulous about these things so we can probably just send one person. My boss has been insisting that I go because:

1. I was the one who found the opportunity and prepared the entries
2. English is my native tongue while my team mates speak English as a third language and aren't too comfortable presenting in English in front of such a big crowd (no translators for the conference)
3. I've presented in the same conference in a different year in my former life in the private sector.
4. My boss is a bit advanced in age and just doesn't like traveling much anymore. She always says she's had her fill from her decades in this industry.

I personally also want to go because:

1. Among everyone on my team, I'd benefit the most from the rest of the conference as it focuses on my former industry that I fully intend on returning to in the mid-term, and some of the topics covered will also help me in my current role.
2. As superficial as it sounds, I wanna see the country where the conference will be. My other team mates have been there.

Buuuuuuut, there's a little voice in my head that's telling me that IBTA if I don't turn this down for two major reasons:

1. As an international staff member, I think it would be more appropriate to let the locals tell their own story. English may be a challenge, but I can definitely coach them and even prepare their speech.
2. I wasn't there for the implementation of the main bulk of the specific project component. I've studied it at length, and picked up where the person I replaced left off, but still.

So yeah. WIBTA if I don't *insist* that someone else represent our team for this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzdpuh	2019-06-11 15:13:34	Ig79	AITA For refusing to do odd-jobs for my uncle?	"INFO: I'm what most people would refer to as ""handy"".  I do many of my own car repairs, home repairs/improvement, etc.  I've saved myself thousands over the years and I've helped family and friends as well by doing work on the side for far less than what a professional would charge.  But I'm turning 40 this year and I no longer enjoy the work nor do I need the extra beer money.  I've been turning people down on these grounds and everyone has been understanding.  Except, it seems, for one of my uncles.

Backstory:

A couple years ago he called me early on a Saturday morning with a leaking water heater.  I cancelled my plans for the day to go help and sure enough, it was shot.  We went to the local home improvement store to get a new unit and a couple odds and ends necessary for the installation.  He paid for all this with his credit card.  I had him up and running by noon and asked $100 for my time (4 hours +/-).  I felt that was more than fair, being a fraction of what a plumber would charge on a weekend.  He claimed he ""didn't have that kind of money"".  Which I knew was bullshit, but what could I say?  I settled for $80.  When I watched him peel four twenties off a wad of at least $500, I told him to call a plumber next time, packed up my tools, and left.

Since that incident, he's asked my help 4-5 times and each time I've turned him down.  I've been clear that I no longer do side jobs, for anyone, and that I'm trying to get away from being everyone’s handyman.  These conversations have never gotten heated.  We remain on friendly terms.  But he always seems miffed like he thinks I'm obligated to him or something.  Anyway, I digress.

Fast forward to the Mother's Day family gathering this year.

My 92 year old grandmother asked me if I could come take a look at a busted pipe at her house and I said of course but I was busy at work during the week and it would have to wait until the following weekend (the pipe in question goes to an outdoor hose bib and was shut off from inside so it wasn’t actively leaking).  True, I didn’t particularly want to go fix a broken pipe on my day off but what kind of grandson would I be if I said no?  Besides, I knew it would be a quick, easy fix and even if it wasn’t I’d have still done it.  And either way, I wouldn’t dream of accepting any payment from my grandma (except maybe a couple homemade meatballs or a dish of her world famous potato salad)!

Uncle Water Heater was sitting nearby listening to the conversation and shot me a look that spoke 1000 words of hate.  His eyes were like daggers.  We didn’t have words but he was obviously pissed that I was doing this when I wouldn't do odd jobs for him.

Maybe I'm reading in too much, but am I the asshole for not performing odd-jobs for my uncle in exchange for a pittance?  Or for making an exception for elderly grandmother?"		0	0
bzdmlg	2019-06-11 15:05:53	saskdodo	AITA for getting my friend to pay for the damage he’s done to my car?	"Monday night dons get together we’re both 17. I’m leaving a bit early because I have a test in the morning. I’m in my car, music on, slide it in reverse and my buddy jumps on the back of my car on the bumper. Startled, I give it more gas and he losses his grip and he gets off my car. There were two of our other friends there so I flipped him off and drove home. 

Getting home I inspected my bumper and it had developed a crack along most of the bumper, right around his footprints on it. My car although a couple years old, was in excellent condition and low KM under 20000. In the kind of person who is usually pretty chill with things being accidentally broken. But he did it on purpose and damaged my property.

When I told him he damaged my vehicle and we had to sort it out he denied causing damage
To my car because he had “jumped on the right places to not cause damage”. Our parents have since discussed and he’s blocked me on all social media and has begun to tell others I’ve done the same to his car in the past. The mentioned days I was out of town, i don’t know how he thinks I was on his car.

bzdlkt	2019-06-11 15:03:27		WIBTA for cancelling shifts I said I would do?	"Hello, I’m looking to find out if I am being an asshole or if what I plan to do is reasonable.

Basically, I work in a restaurant we’ll refer to as ‘A’ part time and I wanted some extra hours. There aren’t any extra hours available so I agreed to cover some shifts in another restaurant we’ll call ‘B’ (same company, different store).

The shifts are in 3 weeks from now and I have done a couple in this restaurant before, so I sort of know what to do. However, I’m having second thoughts on whether I should do the shifts because I saw the rotas yesterday and the manager has put me on shift by myself, with no other staff, which I am not comfortable with.

I also have some exams to sit in early August and there is a tutoring workshop that I would like to attend, which is scheduled for the exact days and even times of the shifts. I’d essentially be losing 2 weeks out of 8 for studying for the exam which I have sat and failed 3 times now. I need to pass it or I don’t get entry into the next year of study, so studying is very important. 

My question is, if I messaged the manager of B and said I was no longer able to do the shifts, WIBTA? Or is the fact that the shifts are in 3 weeks time enough notice that I shouldn’t feel guilty? 

I should point out that the manager of A would not be bothered if I cancelled the shifts.

bzdjnk	2019-06-11 14:59:17	littlestar95	AITA for cutting out my (ex) best friend without her knowing.	"I have a lot of love and respect for this girl and I’m so proud of her. ’ll explain the timeline of friendship as quick as I can: we basically grew up together in the same church, then went to the same high school, had the same group of friends until a few bullying incidents and are now next door neighbours. For the longest time I saw her being a bridesmaid at my wedding, and would always text her to see how she’s doing. I’ve stopped doing that since our fallout. 

Now I will admit, we haven’t been the most perfect friends to each other but we still tried our best. There were a lot of things she did that really threw me off and made me slow down my contact with her, the events of January was just the last straw. There are things I have been at fault of in the relationship too. 

At the start of the year I went my separate way, unfollowed her on social media except for Facebook and also deleted her phone number. I haven’t talked to her at all since then, and she only reached contact on my birthday (whilst using the wrong name (like who TF does that? I’ve told you my name is X and I hate being called Y. So stop calling me Y). I just said thank you - and because I wasn’t sure it was her I asked who it was but she never responded. 

However, I’m starting to feel guilty for not checking in on her or trying to talk to her. My boyfriend says that we’re old friends and none of this should matter because it’s “petty drama” that’s just built up (there’s also a thing from high school that made me stop being friends with her too). Especially since she doesn’t know I cut her out of my life."	Not enough info	0	0

bzdgvj	2019-06-11 14:52:50		AITA For not checking up on my friend	"So where to start...

&#x200B;

Recently I went through a fairly rough period of stress, anxiety and panic attacks. Not really having the mental tools to deal with this, I took to calling a close friend of mine for support. It could end up being 2-3 calls a week with me being at different levels of freaking out.

&#x200B;

Now here's the problem. This friend of mine has been struggling with heavy depression, and I knew this. However, she was one the few people I felt I could talk to my issues about. I felt bad about calling, knowing she had her own problems, but I didn't know who else to talk to. I explaind this and said that if she didn't feel like talking, she didn't have to, and that I would understand. A few times she would ignore my calls. She eventually told me she would of course try to help me as best she could, but that it would be nice if I could call her once in a while when I wasn't in need of help.

&#x200B;

Eventually this rough period passed and I stopped calling her 2-3 times a week. I decided to make sure I wasn't in need of help before contacting her again, and giving her some time without me bothering her. We talked a bit during her birthday, but she wasn't feeling like meeting up, and after that we didn't talk for about 7 weeks.

&#x200B;

Once I feel a bit more like myself I decide to call her. She doesn't answer. The next day she texts me basically saying she has been waiting for me to see how she's doing and that it was really crappy of me, with me knowing her situation. I tried to explain my thought process and that she could always have contacted me if she wanted help/to talk. But she wouldn't have it.

&#x200B;

At the time it felt like the right thing to stop bothering her for a while, but now I just feel like an asshole. Should I?"		1	0

bzddh1	2019-06-11 14:45:06	Smitty_S39	AITA for flipping my stepsons car for a profit?	" *edited for attempt at formatting*
  First, a little backstory... My new wife comes from a very upper-middle class family (Her dad started with nothing and is worth a few million, I assume, from construction business he started) and never wanted for anything, so her son (22 yr old) was raised the same way. I, on the other hand, come from the lower end of the middle class spectrum and was taught the value of things and their potential value to others.

  We live in an upper-middle class suburb where nearly all of the children are the epitome of the ""self-entitled milennial"" variety. An extremely well-to-do family friend that views cars as disposable objects overheard the 16yo stepson and his best friend discussing his lack of car and said ""I just bought a new Mercedes last week, you can have my old car."" So he acquired a 10 year old Audi for zero cost.

  Over the last 6 years, he's paid for gas. Grandma has paid for maintanence, repairs, tires, etc. He's wrecked this car 2-3 times. He managed to somehow bust a power steering line, as well as headlights and a taillight, etc. although the car was still technically driveable. Because it looked like garbage, though, he just stopped driving it. (He's very focused on appearances vs. practicality) 

  After it having been sitting in front of the house for the last 4 months, the wife wanted it gone and they approached me with selling it, the wife asking me if I would ""help him"" sell it. I asked him what the lowest offer was that he would accept for the car and he stated ""$200 for it, I don't want to deal with it, just want it gone"". I plainly asked ""So anything over $200, I get as a commission?"". Both he and the wife, almost in unison, said ""NO! It's not your car, if you sell it then the money goes to stepson, regardless of what it brings!"" So, I'll admit, I wasn't trying my hardest to move this car given that the selfish attitude from the pair of them soured me on ""helping him"".

  I let it sit for another week and then asked him last night ""You said $200 for the car, right?"" He responded ""yes"" I said ""I'll have a check for you when you get home and I need you to sign the title."" So, 45 minutes later he comes home and collects his check and signs the title to me. I post it online and have a guy in the driveway within an hour and end up selling it for $950

  The boy gets salty about it, as well as his mother when she gets home, saying that ""It's not about the money, it feels like you deceived me"". I explained that it was a life lesson, you shouldn't expect to be rewarded without putting in the hustle. He felt just because it was ""his car"" he should have gotten the full amount of money,I pointed out that I did literally all the work.

  To settle the dispute, I ended up giving him an additional $275, bringing his total to $475 (half of the total sale) and I was ""forced"" to apologize for ""deceiving him"".

bzddc0	2019-06-11 14:44:45	TinyNovel	AITA if I refuse to let my child travel?	"So this is a touch complicated. My son, four, has been sick off and on most of his life. All respiratory issues of one sort or another. Mainly, pneumonia. He only just got out of the hospital a week ago for pneumonia and next week, his father (who I've divorced) is going to be traveling some 12 hours away and wants to take our son with him. I've refused because we don't even know what's making our son sick. He's been hospitalized twice for pneumonia now and we've caught it early enough twice so he could be on meds instead of needing to go into the hospital. His father is pissed off, as is his entire family. 

I'm feeling really bad about not letting him go. It's to meet family that can't travel due to old age and I had originally said months ago he could go. But he's had pneumonia three times since then and the doctors don't know why he keeps getting sick or what's causing it. They've set us up for an appointment with an allergist, but that's not happening for three more months because he's booked out. 

So am I the asshole for not letting my son go because I'm worried about his health?

Editing to add: Every time he's gotten so sick he wound up with pneumonia he was at his fathers house. I've been the one dealing with the fallout. I don't think, however, it's anything his father is doing, I think there's an allergen out there that's making him this sick. I also want to add that I do NOT think his father is an asshole, I understand why he's upset at my decision and if my son was healthy I'd agree to let him go happily. I want him to meet his great grandparents. But they're in their mid 80s and not exactly in high health themselves, and could possibly catch something from my son as well as he could from them.

Editing again: His doctor wants to see him for an appointment before he decides if he could go on this trip. So depending on what the doctor tells me on Friday, I'll let that influence my knee-jerk ""No he can't go"" reaction. If the doctor says it's safe, I'm going to let him go.

bzdbod	2019-06-11 14:40:41		AITA for wanting to take a few months off between jobs after getting fired from my first one ever?	"I just graduated from college in May, but I’ve been working full-time since April because school was pretty much done at that point anyway. I had the job lined up since winter as long as I graduated, and once I showed them it was mathematically impossible for me to flunk out, they let me start working. For some important context, I’ve been dreaming of the day I’d be done with school my entire life. I’ve been asking my parents since 1st grade if I could drop out, and they had to beg me to stay and finish high school, then did the same thing for college. With great reluctance, I did my 4 year bachelors and got the fuck out of the education system for god. 

Unfortunately, things didn’t work out with my first job, and I got fired on Friday of last week. I took the weekend to kind of mourn the loss of the career, it’s now Tuesday. My parents are pushing me to get back to applying for jobs ASAP, but I’m not sure that’s the right thing for me. I had a hard time dealing with stress the last couple of months and I don’t think rushing back into another stressful situation is a good idea. 

I’ve talked to a few of my friends and a lot of them had a “gap year” meaning they took a year off when they were 18 or 22 and travelled, gaining valuable life experiences you can’t get sitting in a cubicle for 40 hours a week. I don’t think I need a whole year, but I do think I could benefit from 6 months or so of hiking/camping/traveling across the nearby states. 
I expressed to my parents that I wanted to do this, and they lost their shit. They’re trying to convince me to stay in our small town and find another dead-end job that will keep me trapped here long term, when there’s a whole planet out there I haven’t seen yet. It just doesn’t feel right to me to repeat the same mistake twice and expect a different result (the definition of insanity). 

My parents are making me feel like an asshole but I’m just trying to do what I think is best for me and my personal situation, I’ve spent my whole life listening to them and doing what they thought was best but I think I’m done with that, it’s time to make my own decisions about my future and I think rushing back into the work force is a terrible idea.

He forgot that I don’t like being around her and invited her. She immediately accepted and expects to spend the night. I would rather cancel the whole thing than have her come to my home. I don’t want her drama here nor do I want her knowing where I live. If I cancel I will feel like an asshole to the other people who are looking forward to it. If I uninvited her it will hurt her feelings and cause drama. If I just let her come she will probably cause drama and hit up the other guests for money because that’s what she does. I have no idea what to do. What makes me less of an asshole?	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzd5uw	2019-06-11 14:26:59	mafyoo	AITA for refusing to help with a cancer charity event at work.	"So hear me out,

About 6 or 7 years ago my mother was diagnosed with cancer, was quite a stressful time seeing my mother that poorly after chemo. So i had a couple of days of work to go and visit her, she lives a distance away and i took it as annual leave. When i returned i wasnt quite on the ball in work and my then manager was quite vicious with me (she had that sort of reputation). I explained my situation but she showed no sympathy or empathy and suggested iu should leave my troubles at the door before is start work. TBH she's not a very nice person and since she's not my manager anymore ( I am now more senior than her and she never speaks to me, which lets be honest, i'm happy about)

&#x200B;

fast forward to the start of this year, the manager was diagnosed herself. She is arranging a charity event to raise money and has asked people to help out. I've refused as i've got no sympathy for someone who has no sympathy (i'm not the only one).

&#x200B;

So AITA for refusing to help with an event of someone is ill who has shown no sympathy for anyone else in the past.

&#x200B;

UPDATE - Hey, got more reponses than i expected quite quickly so thought i would add a little more to stop me being asked the same question. Hope this helps.

I'm not advocating not helping any charity, just supporting this woman in her drive on this event. i dont want to give up my spare time to help her, i have other things i'd rather do. I also,have money that comes out of my wages every month to various charities."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzd5cn	2019-06-11 14:25:52	nwi342	WIBTA for not going to a wedding with my partner?	" **Key Players**

Me: Me (M)

P: Partner of ten years (M)

BF1: Best Friend 1 (F)

BF2: Best Friend 2 (F)

C: BF2's cousin (F)

The four of us (not C) are all best friends though after last year, nothing feels the same anymore.

&#x200B;

Fall of 2018, P went on vacation with his two friends. He has known BF1 since middle school; I have known BF2 since elementary school. Admittedly, he is closer with both but I consider(ed) these two women (specifically BF2) my best friends, too (possibly my only friends). The trip was for the three of them. I was not invited on this trip and I was hurt by this. They vacationed for a week in Colorado, staying at C's apartment, all planned summer 2018 by BF2.

&#x200B;

While BF1 lives elsewhere, the other three of us (Me, P, BF2) live in the same city. When I heard the plans for their vacation, I was told, ""there isn't enough space in C's apartment...but if you wanted to come with all of us, we could all get a hotel and pay for it and stay somewhere else then"". It was proposed to me as more of a wrench-in-the-works, last-minute-change-of-plans-if-you-absolutely-need-to-be-here sort of solution. Felt like shit and extremely disingenuous. I have not felt the same about BF2 since then. While I feel I could have been included in this vacation if they wanted, I took her at her word. They had stayed at this apartment before and it is quite small. (Sidenote: They all know I work in hospitality and could have very easily gotten a nearly-free room for us if needed. It was never a very good excuse to exclude me.)

&#x200B;

A week before they left, P and I fell asleep on the couch. He was texting a group chat called ""CO VACATION!"" or something like that--P, BF1, and BF2 were the recipients. I picked up his phone, saw P had texted ""Yeah nwi342 is really butthurt he wasn't invited but he'll get over it."" Didn't have the stomach to read any more than that. Had I kept reading, I may have gotten a real answer as to why I wasn't invited. I put the phone down and never said anything to him about it.

&#x200B;

P went on the trip. Had a blast, bonded with C and her fiancé. Came back with a million stories and pictures.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to summer 2019. C is getting married.

&#x200B;

I couldn't give a shit if I tried. C is the cousin of an ex-best friend. I've never met C and she lives a thousand miles away. P desperately wants to go back to Colorado to see C and attend her wedding. I have told him in no uncertain terms that I am not going. Every couple of weeks, it gets brought up as though it is still on the calendar for us both. P is free to go alone if he chooses. He is very upset by this. I am not going.

bzd4mj	2019-06-11 14:24:10	mkaters	AITA for inviting my brother and sister-in-law to lunch without asking my roommate?	"This happened several years ago, but it still bothers me, so I am asking reddit. 

TLDR; Invited brother and SIL for lunch without telling roommate. Things blew up. 

**Background**

We had few roommate issues. I cleaned more but didn't mind. We had our own bathrooms. My roommate was from another country, but spoke English extremely well and had been in the US for a long time. She was in her late twenties at the time. 

The small issue we had prior was me cooking dinner with my SO while she tried to work in her bedroom was too loud. She offered to go elsewhere if I gave advanced notice. I tried to do this, but felt guilty kicking her out. So, we avoided using the kitchen when she was home and ate in my bedroom. 

**The Incident**

This incident occurred about 8-9 months into living with RM after I returned from 2 weeks travel.

RM told me she is going to BFs for the weekend. I invited my brother and SIL for lunch that weekend. We made plans for them to come on Sunday afternoon. 

Saturday night, my SO and I returned after a night out, and RM is in the apartment. I was surprised because I thought she was gone for the weekend. I told her about my bro and SIL coming the next day. She became upset because she wanted to do laundry. I offered to change my plans so we would not be in the apartment, but she insisted that I don't. 

Next morning, things were icy. She left before guests arrived (she was invited to join us), returned before they left, and went straight to her room. After, SO and I cleaned up quickly and left the apartment. I texted her to apologize again and to tell that she had the apartment to herself. 

She essentially told me she wanted no further relationship with me and wanted us to avoid each other as much as possible. 

After that, I avoided the apartment as much as possible but tried to remain polite. RM moved into BF's apartment before lease ended. She asked that I have no one in the apartment the week she was moving. I told her it was not a reasonable request but I would try to stay out of her way. She responded by telling me she regretted ever moving in with me, complained about my SO being over too often, and generally telling me I was a bad person. 

I truly feel bad for the way things ended between us, but I still don't understand it. This kind of thing had never been an issue in my previous living situations. So reddit, AITA? Should I have totally altered my plans anyway or had my SO over less? 

INFO: My SO was over 1-2 nights a week and 1-2 nights every other weekend, starting \~6 months into living with RM. We rarely saw RM during the week because we kept opposite schedules. Her BF generally did not sleep over, but often came by unannounced."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzd4fn	2019-06-11 14:23:42	throww192	AITA for not reciprocating an invite to my bridal party?	"Hello all,  

Last winter (2018), a friend of mine (we'll call him Ron) got married and ask me to be a groomsman in his wedding. This was a friend from college who I had spent a good amount of time with there.

Fast forward to this year, and I (29/M) have proposed to my fiance, and we are getting married winter of 2020. I'm getting my  party together, a mix of guys from my childhood, high school, college, and friends now. I had talked to some of my family about the men I intended on asking to be in my bridal party, and they asked about the absence of Ron, as I had mentioned previously that I was thinking of returning the favor.

Ultimately, I decided to ask another friend (we'll call him Mark). Mark has become one of my best friends over the past few years since college (we knew of each other, but went to different schools) when we moved into the same city. I have a lot more in common with Mark than I do with Ron, and feel that even though Ron is an incredibly nice guy, Mark will be in my life for what will likely be forever (his girlfriend and my fiance are friends as well - she's in the bridal party, though that had no influence on my decision). I'm not sure if the same can be said for Ron, as I have seen him only a handful of times since his wedding.

That said, I feel like my family is judging me in some way for adding Mark instead of Ron to my party, and it's been eating at me and making me feel like I made a wrong decision. So, AITA for asking Mark over Ron?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bzd3tc	2019-06-11 14:22:15	gottamakeathrowaway0	AITA for feeling angry with my (ex) best friend for ghosting me?	"JUL 2018 
Friend begins to act distant. Our convos become forced. Vague tweets about a few people and herself. One of these tweets happened to catch my eye, which said: “Took you long enough to notice I’ve gotten tired of you.” 

I had recently broken things off with an extremely toxic and emotionally abusive ex in late June, which I was and am still trying to heal from. Her tweet made my anxiety spike, since my ex has said similar things before. 

I confront her about her distance and her tweets as I was growing concerned. She then admits that the tweet was about me. Her reasoning for posting it was because she was jealous of how I and others were “improving in life” and that she was worried that I was growing tired of all her venting, so she then took her anger out on me. She apologizes and we move forward. Things are back to normal until:

SEPT 2018 / OCT 2018
Friend becomes distant again, worse this time. On her vent account she talks about an artistic burnout (i.e., how she is unable to enjoy music or draw). Because of this she seeks out new people and begins to distance herself from her IRL friends and I (we are internet friends). 

I confront her about it three times: first time she admits she is getting tired of me and needs to be around new people or else she’ll feel drained. I respect her decision and tell her to message me when she wants to. I felt hurt and even somewhat angry, but didn’t voice these thoughts. 

The second time we talk about it in depth and I try opening up to her a little, but she leaves me hanging. 

The third time she says that I am still important to her and that she just needs time to “find herself”. I agree, we talk on and off, until:

APR 2019
Friend rejoins a group chat I’m in (why she left is not related to this). I hear from a common friend that she wants to talk to our other friends and me more.

This is where I make a mistake if I haven’t already: I leave the group because I couldn’t take the tension. I later explain this to our common friend since at this point I really didn’t want to talk to her. 

A day later she messages me, tells me to tell her everything (in her words, “fire away”) and that she will respond as soon as she can. I open up to her and try my best to keep a calm tone. I even crack a few jokes so I wouldn’t come off as angry. 

She leaves me hanging again. A month later she leaves her IRL friends’ group chat (which she added me to). I find out that none of her friends (I am acquainted with some of them) know why she left or even why she drifted away. One even comments, “Does (name) hate us?” 

Though I know people can leave for the sake of their happiness and that friends can drift apart, cutting almost everyone out of her life like that just doesn’t seem right to me. The fact that she also cannot handle confrontation (our friend has always acted as a messenger for her) is infuriating. Maybe we were toxic to her. Maybe there’s something I’m not seeing here.

bzd3fz	2019-06-11 14:21:19		WIBTA if I babysit for people my sister isn't getting along with?	"I have an eleven year old sister who plays with a bunch of neighborhood kids. One family lately has had a problem with her and has not invited her to birthdays, outings, sleepovers, and general afternoon activities that other neighborhood kids around the same age were invited to. 

From my knowledge, it is because the kids have had silly fights over picking flowers, card game rules, and wanting to not share personal information. The mother decided to side with her kids, which has led to my sister getting left out. Totally understandable, they are her kids, but very frustrating, especially given that it is now summer. 

I used to babysit for this family regularly, and I have been asked to babysit in the middle of July. I feel weird going to babysit for a family that is excluding my sister because she doesn't want to tell them why she is sad. :/ Would I be the asshole for cancelling on the mother or an asshole for playing nice with people excluding my sister?"		1	0
bzd1xn	2019-06-11 14:17:46	DanisSpot	AITA for not providing many meaty options?	"I just had an early birthday party at my house over the weekend.  I've been a vegetarian for 5+ years.  Long story short I didn't have any food with meat in it that I provided for my birthday party.  We had plenty of food.  Just no meat options we provided.  (I had my mum make party pies and bring them for my fussy siblings) 

So as a guide I had cupcakes, soy crisps,  doritos,  dips, cheese, potato chips, olives, cool drink,  vodka, roasted vegetables, vegetarian lasagne,  cauliflower broccoli cheese bake, and cob loaf.  We were organised for more food if needed but that was it.

When I go to others homes I ask if I should bring meat options, and try to be the least annoying a guest as I can be. But I am curious as whether it's regarded an asshole thing to do inviting all these carnivores and providing no meat."	Party Pies	0	0

We had a bad day and fought a lot over stupid stuff. I got a glass of apple juice and placed it on the window frame, when he closed the door hard the blinds caused it to drop down and spill all over his bed. I felt really bad and guilty because he hates the smell so we cleaned it all up and we were already on bad terms so I bought a plane ticket home. Then after that we came on better terms and I regretted buying the ticket because I wanted to stay longer, so I told my mom I got food poisoning and I will buy a new ticket when I feel better. Then she called the airline and stuff and got my ticket money back somehow from insurance from me being “sick”.  I feel bad because I did not need the money back, I made a mistake buying it and I did not buy it refundable. Someone else could have needed the money and I feel like an asshole although now it is too late and I never asked her to refund my ticket. 

It was around 40 dollars and I never expected her to be able to get it refunded, all the other times my flights or train trips been cancelled I have not got a penny so I don’t know if I should feel guilty or not. I guess they technically owed me this money but it feels bad they refunded the ticket that should not have been refunded."	Asshole	1	0

The conversation shifted to the topic of how we know people who don't take good care of their siblings' kids if their sibling has died.

 I was feeling really bad about a kid I used to know whose uncle and Aunt abused him when he was a child after he was left in their custody when his parents died.
I was sharing this with my sister and she said that what the Uncle and Aunt did was horrible but she understands if they are not willing to take care of a kid.

I asked her about it and she told me that she believes that taking care of a kid is a heavy responsibility and it is very costly too. She then proceeded to say that if I died, she would not take care of my future kids too. 

Now, she makes quite a lot and has a very decent job so the monetary part just doesn't make sense to me. I would take care of her kids if something happens to her anytime and expected the same out of her. 

Btw, we don't have kids but I plan to one day and it's really disheartening to hear that they won't have a support system if something happens to me.

For context: I’m 16. I love my mom but I feel like I have no control over what she decides for me. She speaks for me, signs me up for things without getting my permission, and holds grudges for months without telling me and then punished me. Last summer she signed me up for church camp without telling me or getting my permission and this summer she’s making me get a job even though I told her I didn’t want one. I never borrow money from my parents because it makes me uncomfortable and already make my own. There have been numerous things like this, she recently told me she signed me up for driving lessons a day before an overseas trip I’ve been preparing for the entire year. I’m so grateful to be able to go on this trip but I’m gonna have so much to do the day before. She didn’t even ask my permission to do it, she just told me she signed me up one day. She knew I didn’t have the time and I would hate it but went ahead with it anyways. I don’t even wanna drive anymore because she already decided for me that I’d have to drive my siblings to their games on the weekends. I don’t mind helping my parents but I love having the weekends to myself and don’t wanna wake up to drive them to 8 am games. I feel like I can’t even tell her how I feel because I’ve told her before and it only changes for a few weeks before she goes back to acting the same way. She really tries her best to be a good mom but I feel like I don’t have a say in anything she decides for me. Am I just being selfish?		1	0

There have been millions of “pray for KD” posts and the general manager even broke down crying in an interview talking about it. So am I the asshole for thinking this is insane? 
I mean, he didn’t die? Dude is making almost a billion dollars to play sports and will still be making this much money after the injury, why should I waste my time feeling sorry for him? He’s had an amazing life and I don’t see anything wrong with a sports fan saying “well, at least my team has a better shot to win now”. It’s ridiculous to me that I should act like it’s a huge deal for a multi millionaire to get injured or to feel an ounce of sadness for him or any popular sports player with millions of dollars. The only thing that sucks to me is the pain of it, that I feel sorry for. Anything outside of that, seems like a huge overreaction to me.

After I broke up with her, she made up several rumours, including one that I was stalking her - which our mutual friends knew was false, as she would text that I was standing outside her window with a knife, at times when I was actually (unbeknownst to her) hanging out with our mutual friends. 

The rumours hurt and I was disappointed our mutual friends didn’t intervene, didn’t call her out or anything. Eventually I realised my ex was trying to “win” friends over and get people to choose sides, even if it meant lying. I tried to rise above it but having to deal with a new rumour every week became so depressing. 

Things reached a point where I was so sick of her and her toxicity, that I decided to cut social media ties with anyone who knew her, including our mutual friends. I know it wasn’t the best thing to do but the alternative was to deactivate my accounts and become a hermit. I’ve never had someone lie about me like that so it really affected my mental health. 

I was still friendly with them the few times we ran into each other real life, I just didn’t wanna see them online because it gave me anxiety about what new rumour I’d have to debunk. Blocking them had the unintended effect of ending our friendship, but my mental health was more important, and it’s not like they ever reached out to me outside of social media. 

Anyways, months later one of them called me out for blocking them all, so I explained to her that it was nothing personal and was to do with my ex, but I didn’t wanna go into details about it. She didn’t really accept my explanation. I’m aware that they’re all mad at me now.

So, my parents got divorced when I was 7. It was not a 
clean break. Over the course of five years, they had three custody battles. They also weren’t the type to keep the kids out of it, either. When I was younger, it seemed like my parents would have a talk with me or my brother about why the other parent sucked at least once a week.Whenever it seemed like we were defending the other parent or comparing them, they would get PISSED, even though they are kind of similar.

My dad had problems with me calling him. He’d say that as his children, we were obligated to call him and that he shouldn’t have to. My mom hated it when we compared her to him or said anything about wanting to spend more time with him. She’d say it wasn’t our choice.

My parents also used us as messengers because they hated talking to each other, which led to them always thinking the other parent put us up to it whenever we criticized them.

Eventually, this stuff calmed down, but it’s still present. My dad recently called the cops over my mom not wanting to let my bro bring his switch to dads. I had to explain to the police that it was nothing big and then console my brother. My mom is mad at me because I didn’t immediately sit with her when we went to an informational meeting for my brother and at my brother because he forgot to send her pictures from a dance he went to. 

After all of this, I think I’ve just settled into apathy. Whenever my dad yells at me for not calling him, I just nod and say sorry. Whenever my mom gets mad, I do the same thing. If they criticize each other, I nod and agree. I’ve essentially turned into a yes-man. I feel like a piece of shit for it, but I’m just tired of dealing with them.

bzcs2n	2019-06-11 13:54:23	frensnotf00d	AITA for asking my mom to talk to her housekeeper	"My mom has a physical disability, my dad has a demanding job, my sister is a high functioning autistic but she doesn’t help around the house much. So mom has gone through several housekeepers while I was at college. She really likes this current one. She’s very respectful of my mom, easy to talk to, and diligent.
One day I was home for fall break or something and a gold earring fell out of my ear. It’s difficult to put back in and I just went back to sleep. The next day I went back to school forgetting about the earring but I remember exactly where I put it. When I come home for winter break, my room is cleaned, some clothes I left on the ground are organized now and there’s a comforter. I’m a bit annoyed Bc I told my mom I don’t want anytime cleaning my room. It makes me feel guilty for being messy and nervous that someone is seeing my things (I have stacks of journals, personal notes, cards). And when I look for my earring it’s not where I put it. I blame myself for just not putting it back in my ear. And then during break I take a bath, take off my ring put it in a drawer. I go back to school, come back in a few weeks for something, my room has been cleaned  when I check my drawer my ring is missing. I start to be suspicious but I don’t say anything. My mom is already frustrated that I’m upset someone is cleaning my room. But I don’t have a lock on my door I can’t really do anything about it. 

Now I’m home for the summer. My freaking edibles are missing from the same drawer. I really didn’t expect those to be taken but I chock it up to my dad or brother being nosy. But today my mom notices a $100 bill missing. Also my dad kept a gold necklace in his office drawer. She nervously asks me to check if it’s there. (My mom kept telling my dad to put it somewhere safe but he didn’t). The pendant is but the necklace isn’t. I tell my mom about my two pieces of jewelry missing. (I’m also going to ask my sister to check if she has anything missing) 

I’m very suspicious of the housekeeper now. My mom says she has been going through health problems which is rough bc she has no insurance. Her regular job is demanding and pays very little. She has a daughter. My mom doesn’t want to bring it up bc thinks it’s human behavior for someone in this position to take things of monetary value. But my grandma gave me those earrings! And then my mom says it’s our fault for not putting things safely (but I put my things in a drawer not strewn about) finally  my mom says this housekeeper has been a blessing to her and she doesn’t want to risk losing the help. I’m adamant that my mom at least bring it up, at least with me or my dad around. 

I’ll admit I’m partially just upset with my mom for continuously sending the housekeeper upstairs to my room but it doesn’t erase the fact that several things are now missing. But if she brings it up the relationship could be irreparable.

"I exited a highway which was late at night, nobody else seen on the road except 1 car, the guy sat in my blind spot while i needed to merge. He slowed down and sped up as i did. Preventing me from moving to the next lane always matching my speed. Until i was running out of road. I noticed a dent in the front left panel which was made in a previous accident or scrape while backing out of a carpark.

I floored it and got in front of him and made some distance between, but the lights turned red ahead. He pulled up beside me and i could see him taunting me out of my peripheral vision. finger up, waving at me. Which i just ignored him.

The lights turn green, i let him go. I go slowly to let him leave my vision.

I forgot about him for a moment until he pulls out from being parked on the side of the road. The 2 lanes merge into 1 not far down and he performs the same actions as before, sitting next to me so i can't merge over. This time i stop, let him go by, pull in behind him and then i overtake him, finger up. By this time I am beginning to get the rage. He attempts to keep up with me. I turned another corner and left him far behind. I reach the next set of lights which have a speed camera on them, i slowed down so he could catch up. They change, i make it through before red, but he didn't, got flashed by the camera. At this point i am laughing. but he is angry and swerving all over the road. I then touch my brakes to flash my red lights to piss him off even further. Slow down and speed up each time he gets close to hitting my car. He actually tried to hit me but lost control and snagged his car on a crossing with a barricade in the middle. His car was stuck, so i turned around, put my finger up at him and left.

"So my little sister is finally graduating, she's struggled with alot of anxiety and depression as well as has dropped out a couple of times. She's 25 and she's finally done college and I couldn't be more proud of her!

The problem is that both my parents are alcoholics, they have abused us, neglected us, have ruined every major milestone in our lives by one of them being drunk. Any time we celebrated things, it turned out into an all out family war, one of my parents gets violent and someone ends up in a hospital. They have ruined all of our childhood. 

I lost my childhood due to taking care of my siblings and trying to work and shield them from what my parents truly were, of course now they are old enough to understand what we've been thru. One of my siblings lives at home trying to look for redemption in my parents, the youngest one who has struggled with all of this the most and is graduating lives with me, hence why she was able to graduate.

Her graduation is today, my parents are invited, I called them and told them that if either of them decide to pick up a bottle today, not to bother coming, but if they stay sober, they are more than welcome to attend the graduation and come to dinner at our house after as well. They told my sister that I told them not to come at all and that my dad is drinking now because he's hurt (eye roll) now my sister is pissed at me. 

I tried to explain to her that it's not what happened and they are trying to manipulate her, she feels bad for them. I'm sure my sister is just excited for her day and upset about the drama, I'm not sure how to fix this. The only reason my parents stayed sober on my wedding day is because I told them I will have them police escorted out of there if either of them appear to be drunk, I thought o could just help my sister too.

bzcq79	2019-06-11 13:49:52	Mamnmal	WIBTA for saying no to my father about traveling to 330 miles up north for a month?	"So I don't know for sure but my stepmom just told me that my father wants me and my brother to visit him where he works. He works in another city that is 330 miles away and is rarely home. We see him for 3 days every month.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm still in HS and I am really excited about this summer. I had big plans that I've been talking about for months. I wan't to work out a lot, I want to read up on calculus and french, I want to spend more time w/ my biological mother and I want to spend time with my friends. He knows how much I've been looking forward to it and I really don't want to spend half of summer vacation sitting in a tiny dorm. My stepmom suggested that I could bring my PlayStation and play on it while dad is at work and when he gets back, you'll hang out. This was the year I would finally step outside during summer break.

&#x200B;

As I said, now my dad wants me and my brother to visit him where he works, stay there for a month and do basically nothing as I don't know the place (I have never been to the northern parts of my country).

&#x200B;

I love my dad more than anything. Although he doesn't always get me, I get him and understand how he might feel. He doesn't want to be away from his son for so long and I wouldn't either.

&#x200B;

**What I'm asking is: Would I be the asshole for saying no to my father about all this?**

&#x200B;

Also, something that bothers me is that I know my father will ask me this himself in the last second so I have very little time to think. I usually end up following his lead. I can't help it.

bzcob4	2019-06-11 13:45:14		AITA for cutting someone out of my life because I was too attached	When I was around 16 I was in an open relationship. I started seeing a girl on the side and we basically hooked up constantly. A year after this all started my main relationship turned toxic and abusive. I began feeling worthless and just tired all the time. This side girl basically became my escape. One day I dumped my main girlfriend and this side girl also became very cold towards me. Turns out they were pals and my main girlfriend lied about the situation and called me the abusive one. The side girl then proceeded to make the rest of high school a living hell for me. Rumors of abuse were spread about me and everyone bullied me and treated me like garbage. The summer after I graduation I was at a party and the side girl and I were both wasted and she apologized and I forgave her due to my drunk state. From there we texted a lot and remained decent friends. From there I began to realize how weird my emotions towards this girl were. I honestly had romantic feelings toward her but I also had this rage and hatred towards her for my high school torment. This lead to me spending hours stalking her on social media and doing other questionable behavior. Fast forward to now. I am in a loving, non-open, and happy relationship with a girl I met on tinder. I decided that my borderline stalker behavior needed to stop so I completely blocked this side girl from social media and cut her out of my life. Yesterday she confronted me while I was at work. She was in tears about everything and asked me why I just cut her out of my life. I didn’t want to tell her the truth about my obsessive behavior so I told her to get out and never contact me again. She stormed out and I just feel terrible. AITA?		1	0

bzcnjn	2019-06-11 13:43:24	NerdMachine	AITA for resisting helping people with IT issues at work?	"I am head of a finance department for a location of a national company.  I am also the youngest and most tech savvy at my location so people ask me to help with all kinds of random tech issues.

At first I was happy to help even though it's not part of my job description but over time people seemed to think that I was obligated to help them and would act slighted when I told them to just call IT.  I was finding it consumed a lot of my time throughout the day with lots of little distractions that added up, but to each person asking for help it probably seemed pretty petty that I didn't help.

I will now only help people on my team if I can do it quickly. Even on my own team where I rely on them to be productive (part of my compensation is tied to our results) I will get them to put in tickets sometimes for things I could fix in about the same time because I want them to be self-sufficient.

For people outside of my department I will almost always just tell them to call IT if they can't solve the issue themselves with 15 seconds of advice from me.

I do still help corporate IT fairly regularly.  E.g. we needed something replaced in our server room and I'm the only one who knows it well enough for IT to explain stuff to me.  IT walked me through installation of a switch rather than pay a contractor or fly in a guy from corporate.  I'm fine with this because it's fun and saves our location thousands of dollars (which benefits me).

Some examples:

* My direct report needed a password reset and was confused about the new ticket system.  I told her to just call IT if she didn't want to put in a ticket rather than show her how to do it.  I did tell her that it was under bookmarks and have showed her how to use it in the past.  I had her put IT's phone number on a sticky on her PC as well so she can just use that in the future.
* A salesperson (not my dept) asked me the bosses phone number.  I actually do have his number memorized but I am tired of people asking me this crap because we have a company wide phone listing on our phones that takes 5 seconds to use.  I have shown him how to use it before.  He then asked someone else because I guess he forgets how to use it.
* My direct report couldn't figure out why her icons looked different.  I looked at it and was able to determine that she didn't maximize a certain window correctly.  She was able to fix it with a quick tip from me and didn't call IT.
* My other direct report wanted to take a screen shot.  I gave her a 15 second less on on the snipping tool and she is now self-sufficient with it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzcmlb	2019-06-11 13:41:06	LoveFlow47	AITA for telling my babymomma I thought she might be Autistic?	"Me and the my BM have been seperated practically since conception. She has Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, ADHD and Anxiety, and her behavior was always alarming to me. Not in a way I believed would ever harm my child, but in a way that would make everything incredibly difficult for me to be as involved as I wanted (Denying me paternity acknowledgment, calling SS on me for no reason, denying me visitation, etc.) She never seemed able to step in my shoes, sometimes it was very hard to ""connect"" with her, and her emotions in general seemed vastly different than most. Sometimes her tone wouldn't match her emotion, she would tell story's in a very disconnected and impersonal way, and she just couldn't take any level of criticism and didn't seem to be able to analyze her own behavior. 

I kept this all to myself, until my mother picked up my son from daycare and they pulled her to the side to ask if we understood Victoria's behavior. They were describing a lot of the same things we experienced, and my mother told the lady at the daycare that she thinks Victoria may have autism, which also seemed to make sense to them. I've also had a few friends think this too, though admittedly they didn't know her personally, just through me telling stories. 

At some point we started trying to be friends again. I'm very weird in the sense that I struggle with being acquaintances or ""kind of"" friends, im either on a deep thing all the time or I just don't me as with you much. Anyway, I was trying to tell her a few things I was experiencing from her from my perspective, and at some point the conversation came up that I didn't believe she did anything mean out of ill intent, but her behavior may have been off due to her mental illnesses. She's a naturally sweet and incredibly caring, I don't believe she was trying to do anything except try to feel like her and her child were safe no matter how erratic she was. I forget exactly how the conversation went, but I told her I thought she may be autistic and a few others believed this as a possibility as well. She exclaimed she knew she was not, than asked who else thought this. I told her the situation with the daycare, and of the friends who came to this conclusion as well. She seemed hurt... Her friend texted me later saying my ego was getting in the way of my reality and I was being cruel and belittling her. I felt as though I was attempting to get her to understand my perspective, as well as other peoples perspective, so she could know that people experience a disconnect with her she may not be aware of and so she could address the issue with a professional. As a matter of fact, she did, and two separate psychologist told her she indeed was not autistic. I still am not sure if her ""disconnect"" comes from Bipolar, Anxiety, or (not trying to be rude) a low IQ, but I'm not the only one who experiences this with her.

I’m not saying I’m always right but I’ve always apologised whenever I’ve been in the wrong, and I even looked out for spoilers for him when he was watching game of thrones, even went as far as to tell him to avoid certain people’s posts and stories.

bzclea	2019-06-11 13:38:02		AITA for telling my mom that she can't come to my summer trip with me?	"Actually, that's not what i actually said. But there is a lot more to tell before that. Let me tell you why i'm taking this ""summer trip""...

My mother[36 f] and father[53 m] divorced like 9 months ago. Mom left the house to live with her sister but she couldn't get along with her and came back like 3 weeks after the divorce. So me[18 f] , my sister[15 f] and my divorced parents have been living together since then. And we are having a lot of problems. (If you wonder, you can read my previous post about my cat for one of them) 

The idea of this trip started when my cousin went to a seaside city to work last summer. When he came back, he told me that this year i should go with him. We are at the same age so it should be ok for me too. I opened this idea to discuss with my parents. My father agreed. I'll go this summer, will probably rent a house and work. BUT my intention is not to spend only the summer there. I intend to move out. I don't know if i can manage it, but i really can't bear to be anywhere near my problematic family. And they don't want my cat. My cat is sick and need treatment and patience. I take care of her cleaning, vet visits, and medicines WHILE my selfish sister and mother are always watching the cat, complaining about every single thing she did wrong. Threatening me with expelling the cat... (For example she has a problem with her butt which causes poop stains on floor sometimes which i clean after her immediately but she healed %70 by now.) Cat is only one of the problems. There are a lot of reasons that i can't tell here which makes me think that i can't live here anymore.

So yes. I love my parents and my sister because no matter what, they are my family. But we just can't get along. They are not good for me and for my anxiety. 

So this ""summer trip"" is all about getting away from them. And the fact that i'll go to work there is clear from months ago. So last night, while we were talking about our plans, my mother suggested that her and i would go to a seaside city and work there for summer AS IF it was an idea that she just found and i never mentioned that i'll do it on my own this summer. Well... I suggested that she'd do it with my sister. She told me to leave the room. So yes. AITA for that?"	No A-holes here	1	0

Couple 1, we have lent them money on various occasions as well as watched their three dogs without question on short notice so they could go on weekend trips, or go visit family. We have been like this for about two years now.

Couple 2, we allowed to live with us for three months whilst they searched for an apartment, and have always been there at the drop of a hat for about three years now. 

I requested that couples 1 & 2 help us lay flooring, and paint, I asked politely and offered money and dinner in exchange for their help (it is a large house, more hands make less work). To my surprise, both couples said yes they would help. 

Well it came down to it, and each night for the last week that I have depended on them for help, they have come up with excuses not to come, such as:

""I am so exhausted from putting groceries away. I can't come help"" 

""I had to buy my dog a life vest, sorry, super busy tonight""

""Sorry, I just started this movie on Netflix. I'll hit you up when it's over""

"I was hanging out with two of my best friends(I'll call them T and J) recently for the first time in a decent bit and we were just having fun like always. We haven't been able to hang out quite as much since we graduated highschool last year, but we still try to find as much time as possible to get together and do stuff.

The problem happened at T's place. J needed to leave a bit early(by our standards) because he had an early shift the next morning. So it was just T and I after that, and we just went about our thing playing some video games, and BSing around.

I noticed tucked into the side of her bed there was an eevee plush toy. I picked it up out of curiosity, because it was a pretty odd thing to find in her room of all places. We all loved pokemon growing up, but keeping plush toys or stuff like that was usually something we all thought was kinda silly. It then actually hit me that I'd seen this thing before. It was from a few years ago during freshman or sophomore year. T, J, another friend and I were at an arcade and I had won it from one of those stupid crane games. I was planning on throwing it out because I didn't care about keeping it, but on a whim I decided to ask T if she wanted it since I knew eevee was one of her favorites, and she ended up taking it. I figured she probrably ended up throwing it out, so I was pretty amazed to see it again after so long.

I acted surprised and joked around with her that I couldn't believe she kept this thing for so long. She confided in me that she actually sleeps with it most nights, and I just sorta burst out laughing hearing that. I feel kinda bad for that looking back, but that's just so hilariously out of character for her. I wasn't laughing AT her, I just thought it was entertaining.

She told me that it's just because its special and holds sentimental value to her, and that it makes her feel less lonely at night since we haven't been hanging out much lately. Honestly it was kind of heartwarming, but I couldn't help but keep the joke going just a little and I said something about how I couldn't believe how sappy she's gotten. My mistake was probably when I mentioned offhand that I gave it to her because I was gonna throw it out anyway.

She out of nowhere just kinda blew up on me. She told me to go f**k myself, threw the thing at me and yelled that if it's just trash to me(which I never said) that I could have it back. I ended up being thrown out by her and before she closed the door in my face she threw the plush at me again.

I do feel really bad about teasing her so much for it, and she seemed pretty upset, but she just acted so utterly crazy in response. I've never seen her act like this before(she's normally really chill) and I don't really know where to go from here. I decided to hold onto the eevee plush since I figured it'd probably help me make up with her, which I do plan on trying to do.

AITA?

Update: I kinda figured I sucked a bit for it, but it didn't really occur to me for a while just how much of a douche I was for it. I never intended to make her so upset. I'm gonna take one of your guy's advice and buy her another plush and return the eevee one in the hope of making it up to her. Shes like my best friend and I don't want to be responsible for making her feel like crap.

For backstory I have a family member who is about 14 now and my child is 6. We will call them C(my child-male)and W(family member-female). W is high functioning autistic and besides not having many friends lives fairly normally. She only likes to wear certain clothes and do certain activities but for the most part you wouldn’t really guess she was autistic unless you knew. Unfortunately she has a mean streak and you never know when somethings going to happen or what her mood will be. I started noticed when I first had C that if she was around she would do little things around C that didn’t sit well with me. Nothing major but for example there was a time where she was playing with some toy and we said be careful so she got closer to C and we had to than take the thing away. Just little things like that but we just chalked it up to her being small at the time herself. 

Well now that she’s older C likes to play with W but she still does things like that sometimes (like pretending to play a specific game that allows her to be mean to C)or talks about inappropriate things around C. No matter what I do or say she doesn’t listen to me or stop and her mother and father are very very passive and don’t discipline her correctly. I had it the other when we were around the entire family and she was being extremely mean to C to the point I had to tell C to no longer play with her for the day.

bzcf2p	2019-06-11 13:22:21	TipsyComrade	AITA for getting upset with someone over an offensive joke?	"I have a friend who has really bad self confidence issues and it hurts to watch them act like that. I’ll call them Doze. Doze likes to make really edgy jokes as well. I’ve gotten used to it, he says the n word a lot and makes heavily self deprecating jokes, and by heavily I mean I’ve resubmitted this story a few times due to the need to censor what he jokes about, that should hint as to what they’re about.

Well I’m in a server Discord call with a couple of my friends in my personal server. We’ll call them Clover and Crowbar. Really nice conversation, I haven’t talked to Crowbar in awhile and I absolutely adore Clover with every inch of my being.

Doze joins the call.

Doze joins in on the conversation and I’m not upset or anything. Don’t get me wrong, Doze is amazing, their jokes just get to be a bit much at times. Then he cracks a heavy self deprecating joke. One that hits close to home for me as well.

I get really upset. I don’t get angry upset, I just go “Awww no Doze don’t say that awwwwww.” His response is what gets me. He goes “It’s just a joke chill.” 

At that point I’m tired of hearing the same sorry line. I get a bit angry now, and tell him that just because it’s a joke doesn’t mean it’s funny. We start to bicker a bit. 

It isn’t bad or anything, it’s just us going back and forth. My argument that his jokes upset me and giving a half meaningful sorry isnt going to fix it. He argues back that he’s only joking and that I shouldn’t be so upset over a joke.

Doze finally gets really angry over the arguing, with one last burst going “You know what? Fuck off.”

With that Doze was gone. I started to cry. I felt like hell, deciding it probably would’ve been better if I had just taken the joke and shut up about it hitting close to home with me.

The thing is that Doze commonly makes offensive jokes. The self deprecating ones, ones about my dad leaving when I was young, it’s not rare for him to do. That’s the only reason I got that angry this time. Every time he does it I ask him to quit and he apologizes and does it again when the chance is given. 

Clover is trying to calm me down as Crowbar messaged Clover what to do and say. He did calm me down and I thanked him for it. I told them that it was my fault but Crowbar insisted it wasn’t. I know that I can’t wholeheartedly believe that though since Crowbar and I are fairly tight.

Doze and I continue to argue a bit over Snapchat. I decide to just take the blame since I don’t want a friendship to end over something like this.

Still, I don’t know whether I was in the right or Doze was in the right.

TLDR: My friend made a self deprecating joke after I’ve told him that and many other jokes that he commonly makes hits close to home and got mad at him when he brushed it off, then taking the blame so that everything would calm down, even though I still think I was in the right."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzce02	2019-06-11 13:19:34	PowerValveStatic	AITA for refusing to meet my wife's ex-boyfriend?	"My wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. All they do is text each other occasionally, which I have no problem with. I explained to her early on that I am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. She agreed and it was never an issue until now.

Her ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and I to meet. Once again I explained to her that I have zero interest in such a meeting. I see no point to it, I don't need his blessing or approval, and I have enough friends. Plus the whole idea just seems awkward. 

She explained that it would mean a lot to her if I would just meet with him. I asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. I snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *""Since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?""* 

She didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. I know my answer is not going to change and I am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. AITA? Also any advice is much appreciated.

Thank you.

**P.S**

I don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but I think I'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. I love my wife but I don't think I have her heart. He was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.

**EDIT**

With regards to divorcing her over this:

> I'd rather divorce her than control her. I didn't tell her that I would do this, it will simply happen. I can control what I do (not meeting him), but I cannot control what she does. It would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Okay for some context me (17m) and my ex (17f) broke up a few months back mainly due to commitment issues and her not seeing herself with me in the future. Since the breakup we have remained relatively civil and friendly since we both share the same group of friends. 

Okay so my ex writes short stories and articles for the school paper and yesterday out of nowhere the new issue came out and she had gone ahead and written a whole ass short story about a couple which just so happens to detail really private and embarrassing parts of our relationship and making me out to be the bad guy who was manipulative and trying to trap her and the reason we broke up. She included thing like the main character finding out her boyfriend jacked off to porn or the main character in the end returning her boyfriends promise ring, all of which happened to us. She even went so far as to give the boyfriend  a really similar name to mine. 

It was obviously about me and i got a fair few people (mainly girls in our year) calling me a arsehole and a pervert. And when i confronted her about it she simply said she just wrote a story and denied it being about me and simply said thats what came to mind when writing the piece. 

Because of this i made an attempt to set the records straight by writing my own ""story"" and handing it out in school, giving my side of the story and telling everyone the bad things SHE did in our relationship and she was the reason we broke up but everyone even my friends called me a vindictive asshole and that she was just ""reflecting on herself in her work"".

bzcbvk	2019-06-11 13:14:13	vgccrail	WIBTA if I continue to date someone even after I found out how she found me?	"For the past two weeks I have been dating Alicia. We met when she followed me on instagram. We didn't have any mutuals but I followed her back and we started DMing. She is a beautiful solid 10 and works as a doctor. 

I took her on a date last week and we had a great time and kissed at the end of it. 

Earlier this week I met up with my best friend Harriet who I have known since I was a kid. I told her about my date but when I showed her Alicia's picture she was very angry. 

Harriet is a nurse and the two of them work in the same department at the same hospital. Harriet does not like Alicia. She claims that she is a snob who is constantly rude to her and humiliates her at every opportunity. She told me that Alicia saw her on a video call to me on a lunch break, and after she was done said I was cute and tried to pester her for my details. 

Harriet refused but Alicia didn't give up, even said she would stop tormenting her at work if she convinced me to go out with her. 

At one point I was chatting to Harriet over text and she left her phone for a minute or so. According to Harriet this is when Alicia took her chance. Harriet has my number saved as my full name so that was all Alicia needed to look me up on social media. 

Harriet was annoyed with me but understood that I didn't know and we're OK. I phoned up Alicia later and demanded the truth, and she started crying admitting that she did look on Harriet's phone, but it was only on impulse and she didn't plan to do it. She said how sorry she was and begged me to please not dump her over this. I took some time to think about it but in the end we started talking again and met up yesterday. Alicia said she didn't understand why anyone would want to be friends with Harriet but we had a great time again and she invited me to come back home with her. 

We had a great night and by the morning she asked if I'd like to be ''exclusive'' with her. I said I needed time which upset her. I would like to be but I feel like that would really damage my friendship with Harriet. She was fuming when I told her how Alicia found me and I don't think she'd be happy if she became my girlfriend. 

Alicia is a gorgeous, funny, bubbly and lovely person who I really want to see more of but I have a gut feeling that I am betraying my friendship with Harriet.

**UPDATE**: I'm the asshole no doubt about that. My friendship with Harriet should come first, and as you guys have said it's wrong to date someone who is cruel to your friends. I texted Alicia saying I won't risk my friendship with Harriet by dating her, but she hasn't responded so I will update when she does.

**UPDATE 2**: Sooo, after watching my phone all evening I got a call from Alicia and answered to her screaming down the phone. She called me every swear word under the sun. From her voice she sounded wasted drunk. She called me a ''snake'' and said that Harriet was a ''tramp'' and an ''ugly c*nt'' and told me that I'd never get a girl as good as her again. I let her rant at me for a few more seconds before cutting the call. I called Harriet and warned her that there may be more problems at work because of how angry Alicia was and that she should consider involving HR. Thanks for the guidance guys. It was a blunder to consider involving myself with her further but I see the error of my ways."	Asshole	0	0
bzcafz	2019-06-11 13:10:24		AITA for telling my roommate that maybe this guy just DOESN'T like her?	"So my room Jess came out with myself and some co-workers the other weekend. That's where she met my co-worker Peter, who also brought his roommate. Now, I know for a fact Peter is into me. I'm not into him romantically, but I think we make good friends and have fun together.

That night, the 4 of us were getting along well, and Jess later tells me that she has a crush on Peter. Later in the week, the 4 of us go out to a pub for some drinks and food. Jess is all over Peter, but Peter isn't really making any advances on her, although he is his normal playfully flirty self.

Peter tells me on the DL how ""interesting"" of a person Jess is - **she's easily influenced and tends to put on an act in social situations to impress people. Her thing with Peter is she's trying to act mysterious. Peter just thinks she's straight up crazy.**

So last night, Jess and Peter hang out. Jess tells him they're going on an adventure, but she ends up just driving them around aimlessly because the thought of me was ""making her nervous"" and she ""choked"" on actually doing whatever she had planned. She said Peter suggested he sneaks her into our office, and Jess thinks that's code for ""let's fuck in my office."" Maybe, maybe not. Either way, she kept telling me how frustrated he was that he wasn't making a move at all whatsoever and that she wanted to fuck him right there in the car and God WHY wouldn't he make a move!?!?

This is where it gets annoying... Jess tells me that I am ""the pickle on the sandwich that no one wanted"" and that she and Peter ""smell me"" ....................

I ask, ""Like, the fact that I'm the one mutual friend you guys have and you're claiming that mere fact has put a damper on your date?"" She said yes, and kept calling me the pickle no one wanted. I reminded her that SHE'S the pickle that was supposed to come on the side but came on the bun anyway, and that now has to be picked off, OR that Peter is pickle. She sticks with ""No.... you're the pickle and we smell you.""

I told her it sounds like she's self conscious about me working with/being friends with Peter first. She gets a little upset at that, and goes on and on again about how he didn't make a move. So I look her in the eyes and say, ""Jess, did you ever consider.... that maybe.... he *just doesn't like you?*

Her eyes tear up a little and she exclaims, ""WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY TO GO UP TO HIS OFFICE THEN??"" I tell her that I'm JUST saying, it could just be he isn't into her like that. It's life, it happens. She then gets real quiet and goes on her phone for a while, and then says nothing and goes to bed.

I feel bad if I upset her, but I felt like it had to be said. I can't walk on egg shells just because someone's ego is too fragile for you to tell them maybe someone doesn't like them romantically. But, she's also my roommate, and I don't want any animosity. She's just emotionally immature for blaming ME for her shitty date.

bzc7u7	2019-06-11 13:03:51		AITA For being pissed at my father	"All throughout my life I never really received any congratulation for any achievements, some of which I was really proud of.
When I'd tell him about an assignment I did really well in, or an art project I was happy with, he'd either just not respond entirely to what I just told him or give me an emotionally absent 'good job'. 
I'd be okay with this, if it weren't for the other side of the coin. If one of my teachers called him and 
told him that I'd done poorly on something, he'd get really pissed off and tell me angrily tell me I wasn't trying hard enough, despite that when I did try hard I was never acknowledged. Academia is basically one of the only things I'm good at, and it felt kinda shitty to have nobody care at all.

I was not an examplary early teen. 
I drank and smoked weed when I was 14-15, but chilled out after that age.
I remember more times than I can count, him flying into giant fits of rage when I got in trouble, and received a fair beating a handful of times.

Last year I graduated high school, and my dad told me he didn't want to have to sit through the ceremony. I wasn't really too upset at the time, however the influx of graduation posts recently sort of made me wonder if it was shitty of him not to go.
I hear about people's family travelling large distances to watch them graduate and it made me kinda sad that not one of my family members were willing to make the ten minute drive to watch me graduate. I ended up never going to the ceremony.
Shortly after, I was accepted into the most prestigious university in my state, and he didn't really care about that either.

So basically all I'm wondering if I'm TA for being upset about this stuff. I get that I wasn't an examplary child, and I understand I often fucked up. But I'm not happy with the fact that I received solely negative reinforcement for my behavior, and have never really been encouraged. 
I think I might be being a spoiled brat but I honestly can't tell.
And if NTA, should I confront him?"		1	0

In that time span, I’ve said maybe two sentences to his sister. She’s anti social, hates her own family, selfish, and surprised everyone when she told us she was 6 months pregnant. 

The parents were very hurt she didn’t tell them sooner and very concerned that she hasn’t been to a doctor or done any kind of planning for a baby. 

I’ve never spoken to the baby’s daddy (seen him around bfs parents’ house a few times). I’ve tried to make conversation around the holidays but neither of them want to participate in anything. 

She’s working at some shoe store and I don’t think the baby daddy has a job. She’s even had to ask her family for money because this guy obviously can’t support her or the baby. 

I love my boyfriend and his family very dearly. His sister? Not so much. I have no relationship with her. I was invited to the baby shower this week (by their Mom not the sister).  Needless to say I have no interest in her or going to this shower. 

I feel bad because their Mom is trying to include me in family matters. But I don’t want to give her a gift or pretend I care. Haven’t RSVPd yet. 

So Reddit, AITA for having zero interest? Advice if I should go or not is welcome.

Edit: My boyfriend has no relationship with her. His Dad doesn’t either. Only the mom has some sort of relationship with her.  No males are going to shower. The sister would literally not give a single shit if I was there or not.

bzc6gx	2019-06-11 13:00:34	Filipp892	AITA for accidentally outing my trans friend by sharing screenshots of her dating profile?	"Throwaway account.

Backstory: I (32/m) have been friends with N for a few years. I knew they identified as non-binary and have always been super cool and supportive of her. We became pretty good friends and I appreciated being able to talk to someone with a different perspective than mine especially for dating advice. We share the same group of friends and have hungout pretty regularly over the years, including a few group trips, holidays, etc. A few months ago, I was stoned scrolling through Tinder and I came across a profile that looked exactly like N but more feminine (make up, longer hair, etc). I thought it was either N or their doppelgänger and thought this was funny so I took a bunch of screenshots of the profile before swiping left. I sent the pictures on an existing group text playfully asking “N, is that you!?”. About 25 minutes later I received a response on the group chat from N stating that it was in fact them, and that she had started to transition more but that she was not ready to share that info with the group. (For context, a few of the other people on the thread live across the country and have not seen N in a few years.)

As soon as I received that response, I immediately apologized and said I meant no harm. Everyone else on the group chat was super supportive but it was very awkward so the subject was quickly changed. I don’t have too many LGBT friends but certainly meant no harm. This was a few months ago and I haven’t heard back from N too much since then (she did accept my apology the next day). My friends have given me split advice on this. A few have said what I did is super fucked up while others says it was a blunder but since I meant no harm it should be fine. I’ve already apologized so not sure what else I can do at this point.

We're all college buddies. But our friendship felt quite shallow, we couldn't share our love problems, coz both girls reply with a joke or starts teasing but it was all okay since it was all fun & games. Until we gathered as working people, they kept bringing up about the past & the men they used to tease me about. But I couldn't tease them back since I think it is too childish to talk about only those things and not something recent.
The 3 of them usually don't accept my suggestion of traveling but surprisingly, the gang wanted to travel together. June said yes a bit later. The 3 of them booked their tickets w/ a mishap. Ashley couldn't join the last 1.5 days of the trip, so as June due to Nancy not giving the right details. So Ashley, I and btw my husband, and June are expected to be together on those days.

6-8 months before the travel date, my husband has prepared ALL the details of the itinerary, to make sure everybody is informed.
But, they still kept asking about the details that were already in the file I gave them.
On the 2nd day, I fell off my motorcycle & was rushed to the nearest clinic. It wasn't life & death but I got abrasions all over my body.
The next day, we were supposed to have a whole day of island hopping but I and hubby stayed in the resort we stayed the night before until we had to check out for the next hotel (in town) that we will stay until the end of our trip. Itwas the same hotel we were staying the 1st night.
Hubby & I drove back to the hotel in town & stayed resting as we wait contact from them. 5pm, their ETA to the hotel, no contact. I sent a message & they replied at 6pm w/ 1 word. Hubby found out it was a restaurant, so we thought we will meet up there. We then walked there, please note that I was I had injuries, 5 minute walk ends up 10-15 min. After 5-10 minutes of waiting right across the restaurant, we decided to go back to the hotel. We were getting hungry, by then reply arrived, they checked in a different hotel. I asked them for an explanation & they thought they don't have a hotel. When we were going back to the hotel, they were on their way back to their hotel from ours to just ""check in"". We met and talked a bit, but I couldn't face & talk to them, my hubby explained about the hotel but they couldn't even say anything.
The next day, Nancy spent her day with us in the same hotel, and we ate dinner together as if nothing happened. She was my Maid of Honor on my church wedding 2 months after that trip so I tried to be the bigger person. We never brought up that incident but it was hard for me to talk with her at all.
I am still waiting for them to say ""Hi"" or to send me a message first coz I can't bring myself to. June is not a problem, he is way better than them, I think.

"my dad recently retired from the army and was given a 100% disability rating from the VA. there’s a few benefits you receive when you’re declared totally and permanently disabled, some of which extend to your dependents like me (22f). i started receiving a monthly stipend intended to be a form of financial assistance for me while i’m at school. my plan for all my future payments is to supplement my existing income during the school year to help pay for things like rent and food and then put the leftover amount in my savings account.


i did just that with the payment i just got. a lot of that money ended up in my savings account. the problem is, ever since then, my mom has been talking about pulling the money out of my account and putting it into one of her accounts because she “doesn’t want me to feel like i have that money.”

i’m not sure what it is exactly, but there’s some sort of extra fee my parents have to pay because i’m using that VA benefit. my parents said that they will pay that amount from my stipend every month. i’m okay with that however, i don’t like my mom moving money around without at least asking me first just because i feel i am capable of controlling my own finances. she still has access to my account from when i was a minor, and while i have my own account at another bank, i still keep this one as my primary just because it never really bothered me that she could see my funds.

she mentioned again today that she was going to move the money from my savings to one of her accounts. she hasn’t been charged by the VA yet so she doesn’t even know yet how much is owed. i mentioned that i would rather keep it in my account so that i know where it is, and then later send her the amount she needs when the time comes. i told her that it’s my money and i would like to control it. she got upset with the phrase “my money”, telling me that i clearly don’t know how family works and i am being really selfish. she said that i never would have had it in the first place if it wasn’t for my father (which is true), meaning that it’s not really “mine” (which is not true). the claim i have with the VA is under my own file, not his, and the only person the VA will disclose information in that file to is me.

again, like i said, i have no problem giving money to my parents, i’m just not comfortable with my mom assuming she can move my funds around and make decisions without me. it makes me feel like a child who is not capable of making my own financial decisions. when i asked my dad about it earlier this week (so before my mom got upset with me today), he agreed that it’s my own money and suggested i get my own account. i know that’s the obvious solution here, but even when i made my account at the other bank (which i literally don’t even use now) my mom asked why i would even need it and asked what i’m trying to hide from her, which makes me feel guilty.

bzbuuq	2019-06-11 12:29:18	ezaffaera	AITA for ending a friendship over a funeral?	"
A bit of background: in my community (and presumably in most others), it is customary to attend funerals, if you are acquainted with the grieving family. This incident happened over a year ago.

TL;DR had a very close friend who ghosted me when a family member died, so I ended our friendship.

So I had a Best Friend (BF, we’re both F, mid-twenties) who was like family to me who stayed at my house regularly at least once a week. My doors were always open to her and we were similar in many aspects: both school dropouts just trying to make it in life, and we both loved art. We were always supportive of each other’s endeavours. She came from a messed up family life and I truly wanted every success for her. I helped her every way I could, including drafting her resumé and finding her gigs through my contacts. Our friendship wasn’t one-sided, of course. I’m sure that if she had the means, she would have done the same for me.

In May last year, my beloved MiL passed away - it was an anticipated death as she had stage 4 cancer, but nothing truly prepares you for loss. This crushed me as I’ve had a rough relationship with my family, so I was closer to my husband’s than my own. BF knew this. The wake was to be held for 7 days, so I conveyed the news to BF and I asked her to visit whenever she could (the wake was in the same neighbourhood where she worked). 

She agrees and said she’ll text me the next day (day 2 of the wake) so we could go together. The next day comes and I don’t hear from her. I was busy meeting visitors the whole day so I did not chase her. At night I scroll through IG stories and find that she was home all day, so I send her a friendly text, something like ‘hey, that looks fun’ (she was playing video games). I didn’t want to throw accusations, so I asked if she was coming to the wake (while maintaining a light tone). She simply replies ‘ah, no’ and offered no further explanation. 

I thought maybe she was just busy, so I texted her the next day. But she firmly replies this time, saying she was uncomfortable attending wakes because she didn’t know the people there (she has never used this excuse for anything before). I insisted that it was a normal communal thing, and nobody was going to chat her up because they will be too busy paying respects. She then changed her argument, citing that her parents never taught her the importance of attending funerals. 

This is where I messed up. I got frustrated because I felt she was being childish, and we had a short verbal spat over text. I decided that I needed to focus on the funeral and she was a source of unnecessary drama. I told her that if she could not spare even 5 minutes to attend the wake (after everything we’ve done for each other), then our friendship is over. She then immediately blocked me on every platform.  

I discovered later that she kept screenshots of our last conversation and posted them on her (then public) social media.

bzbrsj	2019-06-11 12:20:35	DDPM1	AITA for not helping my son turn in his final project? (SOS I have 2.5 hours to decide.)	My son is in 8th grade and had to film himself and his friend making a French food and describing the steps in French. They edited it on iMovie on our kitchen computer. Then he played computer games and fcked around until he went to bed. When I asked him this morning in the car how it went he said: “Oh, right. Can you send it to me when I tried iMovie kept crashing.” If I hadn’t asked I probably would have gotten an email asking me to when he remembered. He does this quasi reg. I said: “I don’t have magic hands it’ll crash for me, too!” And that he should have mentioned it yesterday. It’s a big part of his and his partner’s final grade. So: AITA if I don’t try to send/fix it? He and his partner will only get 1/2 credit if they turn it in tomorrow,  but it will teach him a lesson about following through and how not doing so affects other people too. Or, do I just help him? Add: he does this pretty regularly.	No A-holes here	0	0

However, it’s come up many times and most recently at a wedding this past week that she is insisting that her brothers be a part of my wedding party. I have basically two male friends who I’d like to be my groomsmen/best men and that’s it. Her brothers are great but not anywhere close to the relationship I have with my two best friends. 

She has lots more close friends (and siblings) and talks about how it will be difficult to narrow her bridesmaids down. She includes my sister in having to be a part of the wedding and when I say that she doesn’t have to be, she insists she does because her brothers will be in my party. Then I say, ‘well, I don’t want them to be,’ and all hell breaks loose every time we arrive at this spot. 
Again, most recently was last week at another wedding and several of her female friends nearby decided to chime in at this point and say that the brothers have to be in my wedding party and that I’m being an asshole.

bzbozk	2019-06-11 12:12:45	Landinium	WIBTA if I reported my workmate/housemate for the worst hygiene case I've ever come across?	"Please hear me out.

I have been ill for over a year. Since a bad food poisoning, I've been nauseous every day since May last year. I am barely able to eat anything, I'm on dietary restrictions where I can't eat vegetables (because of the acidity) and I've just been eating carbs and protein for months on end now. Everything is manageable if I don't vomit. If I start to vomit I will be insanely sick for a three day period until it settles down again. The slightest smell will set me off. Strong smells of urine in a public bathroom, for example, means I have to leave and go to the toilet elsewhere or else I'll vomit and be bedridden for days.

I just started a summer job, where I'm working for my University. I'm working with other students and we all live together in the same flat. Work is going well, I'm able to manage my health problems mostly except for one thing. My new housemate/workmate has the worst personal hygiene I've ever come across. I am physically unable to stand within 3 feet of him or else my health issues will start to flare up and I will begin to vomit. The smell of sweat is intense, the smell of grease is overwhelming and the smell of *dirt* is everpresent. It's gotten so bad that I got into a lift that he had left 4/5 minutes prior and I could still smell him. You can smell him through our corridor door and even from outside the apartment door. A customer of ours even made a public review on our website where it referenced a ""male with dark hair"" smelling bad. The guy read it and laughed about it saying it ""could be any of us "" because we all have dark hair. Everyone in the office knows what's up with him but nobody has a health condition similar to mine so I don't think he'll be reported.

I grew up on a farm and this is the worst smell I've ever dealt with. It has made my health problems so unbelievably worse to the point I'm on the verge of gagging daily. If I vomit because of him I will be sick for days on end and will likely be blamed for it. There is a public guest comments box in my workplace. I want to write an anonymous comment detailing his hygiene issues so the management can address it. Failing that I want to bring it up with management directly. On one hand I'll feel guilty and I don't want awkwardness between us, on the other hand there is NO REASON for a grown adult with all capabilities to have hygiene this bad and I feel your right to be smelly ends where it starts affecting someone else in a serious manner.

EDIT: I should mention, he makes no effort to mask this at all. He doesn't wash his hair, he wears no deodorant and comes out of the shower smelling as bad as he went in

bzbjdc	2019-06-11 11:56:55	Fat_Walrus56	AITA for not hanging out with half of my friend group because of one person?	"First a little background info to understand my situation. Ask questions below if something is unclear because it gets a little complicated.

My childhood friend group consists of about 6 people including me. There are currently 4 people in the group, however I believe it's only 2 people in disagreement right now because of drama that one or two of the people started; specifically, the women in the relationships. The men were dragged into the middle of it because they are supporting and defending their spouses naturally. Now the friend group is split up and I'm in the middle of this.

So, let's begin with the story. 

My best friend, I'll refer to him as Jack, from middle school, married my other childhood friend, I'll refer to her as Dianne. Jack and Dianne did not meet until highschool and they both had no idea that I was friends with each other, so Dianne thought that this drew together the friendship a lot more for, ""fate"", reasons or whatever. I'll have to agree it was kinda cool, but I digress.

Jack and I were great friends throughout middle school and in 5th grade I moved out of town. Because Facebook wasn't a thing back in middle school and I didn't have any means of contacting him, our friendship  was put on hold until I reconnected with him in highschool.

In the mean time Jack made a friend who I'll refer to as Adam. Jack and Adam became best friends and I became good friends with Adam as well. 

Normally,  Jack, Dianne, Adam, Dianne's brother, who I'll call, Rick, and myself have all hung out and been great friends. However in the past two years things have changed a bit. 

Adam reconnected with his first girlfriend, Eve. And is engaged to her.

Jack and Dianne are now married. 

Dianne started fighting with Adam's fiance, Eve.

Dianne and Eve are not speaking because of some drama that started between them and Dianne is not inviting Adam or Eve to friend gatherings anymore. 

I experienced first hand! Dianne going behind Adam and Eve's backs and spreading bullshit drama that I have no tolerance for and thus I am starting to cut off my relationship with Dianne for that reason. But of course, because Jack and Dianne are a couple, I can't hang out with just Jack without seeing Dianne, which I want nothing to do with because of how childish and disrespectful she was to Adam and Eve.

So, AITA for not wanting to hang out with Jack and Dianne's side of the friend group because I don't want anything to do with Dianne? 

Granted if all of the guys in the group could hang out by ourselves, we would, but the wives essentially won't allow it.

Part of me wants to confront Dianne and tell her to make up with Eve and grow up! But because I'm in the middle, I don't feel like it's my responsibility. I feel like her spouse Jack should be held more accountable than me and try to fix things but I haven't seen him do anything which is sad to me because he's letting his wife control the majority of things which is unfair."

At the moment My friends and I were out of town at the 2019 E3 convection. We having a enjoyable experience, until my SO suggested I cancel, and go back home ASAP. She texted me she needed comforting and assistance, because she popped a blood vessel. I Insisted she should just put some ice over it and it'll be fine, Since I didn't want to cancel a planned trip just because of a popped blood vessel. She said I was a selfish asshole, and said ""remembered that the next time you get injured."" I said it's never that serious, but there was no response. So I savored the rest of the time I had left with my friends and had a lovable trip. When I returned home my GF seemed pissed and not in the mood for negotiating.

Anyway about 7 showed up (2 work friends 5 I've known for years) and i instantly got the vibe from my non-work friends they didn't want to be there it was like i put a gun to there head and forced them to come, my 2 work friends picked up on it as well so i know I'm not just being paranoid. This continues through out the night luckily my 2 friends went out of their way to make it enjoyable.

&#x200B;

Now to the present situation one of the friends that was there had a similar birthday yesterday and i just didn't give care the whole time partly because he did the same to me and partly because i wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine and now he's pissed at me because i wasn't hype enough on his special day (I'm normally quite energetic so it was pretty obvious). AITA??

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Didn't make a couple things clear enough

1. I wasn't waiting to not care at his party i felt down at his party because he didn't give a crap at mine and then decided i shouldn't feel bad because its a taste of his own medicine.
2. Our Birthdays are 3 weeks apart not a year no idea why people keep thinking that

Edit 2: Thanks for the reply's i understand I was being petty and probably shouldn't have taken it to that level just felt justified at the time guess i was wrong considering the reply's"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bzbhkj	2019-06-11 11:51:40	throwawaycomedian95	AITA for not talking to my mother?	"At 15, I was frequently bullied, failing school, and wanted to change schools. My mother was pushing me to leave high school for a community college, and I just wanted to change schools. It only happened because she screamed, threatened, and intimidated me.

I failed high school, and she shouted me down for wanting to do a University Preparation course. I've entered 2 art courses I was pushed into by my mother which I left after 6 months-1 year, and she's threatened to cancel university when she was angry. I was verbally abused for wanting to change schools and wanting to do university preparation. After 3 years (1 uni prep course and 2 art courses), I entered Computer Science and did well.

I sat her down to explain I was dealing with mental health problems and she didn't believe me.

I explained why I want antidepressants, and she doesn't, so she'd respond with ""ugh, you have to make everything an argument.""

I was taking antidepressants, needed more, and she refused to pay. When I experienced antidepressant withdrawals she went ""poor you, you have it so tough.""

On the other side, I received a lot from them physically. Even after I want to limit contact with my mother, they send me money each week (I wouldn't care if they stopped; I should probably ask to stop it), my father offers to pay for my flights, and try to support me whenever I can. They've always been extremely supportive in other ways, which makes me suspect they just have ignorance around abuse, mental health, and education.

My sister thinks I'm blaming her for my problems. I think this is designed to place a can-do-no-wrong attitude on my parents, when they definitely did wrong. I believe my family doesn't accept responsibility for wrongdoing. I believe I did let myself down by consistently failing school, but I also have plenty of justified things to be angry around."

bzbeb2	2019-06-11 11:41:58	yoteeeeid	AITA for continuously pestering a teacher to allow me onto a club	"Our school had a bouldering/climbing club, but they stopped accepting new members when the teacher who started it left, but kept the club running. The activity isn’t held on campus, but club fees are heavily subsidised by the school for the activity arena, and club members also get a bus ride to/from.

I asked to join the club with a few others, after trying out rock climbing and going to the bouldering place a few times with my own money. The teacher accepted our request.

A week later, someone already in the club came to me with a complaint. It was worded as if she was angry towards the teacher, yet her tone was of exasperation towards me. Someone else had apparently asked to join the club also, but they had been denied. She asked me to speak to the teacher.

Spoke with the teacher, and after her refusing to change her mind, i compared our abilities and insinuated that his skill was far greater than mine. From then, although not outright said, she heavily implied no one would be joining the club (including me). She kept repeating no, but I had no idea what the ‘no’ was referring to (me or the other guy or both) and couldn’t ask as she wouldnt let me get a word in.

Regardless, I was hopeful she didn’t mean it and waited for the club on the day. She sees me, and we make a bit of a scene in front of the club. I stalk off after she shouts, and that’s the end of it.

So am I the asshole for going to her multiple times about the club and showing up at the waiting spot despite the lack of clear permission?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bzbbw1	2019-06-11 11:34:44	crabagepatchdoll	AITA for thinking that there are too many new family members going to be at my house next weekend?	"Edit: mobile, throwaway, yada yada yada. 

So i got married last year, moved into a new house, got a new job and had a baby.  Basically all the big life moments, they happened last year. My husband and I had a courthouse wedding (10/10 highly recommend) and the only people to attend were our mothers.   We both have siblings and fathers. Because we really decided on a date, maybe a month beforehand.  

Something you should know about me; I hate parties. I hate large groups of people. I hate most things, places, events, that are loud. I hate meeting new people, I am shy. My sweet spot is maybe three other people I know well. 

Back to the story; because of our abrupt nuptials, I haven’t met my father in law and his wife irl yet. I’ve spoken to them both on the phone and FaceTimed them. But all of that is baby stuff. Our little one is their first grandchild They are finally coming to meet the baby and me next week. I’ve had time to prepare mentally. 

Last month my husband’s cousin, father-in-law’s niece, drove through the city we live in to go to her air force base. She recently graduated basic training. She was initially supposed to spend the night at our place and then do the last stretch the next day. Long story short, she got a very late start and ended up stopping before she got to our city and then because of a time crunch had to just keep driving the next say. 

She has since decided that she will also come to stay next week. Father in law and husband both say, “I thought she cleared it with you.” to each other. I feel that it’s rude to invite yourself to your uncle’s first meeting with his grandchild and his son’s wife. Especially when it’s only for 4 days. 

So now I have to meet my father in law, who I’ve been told by his ex-wife, my mother in law that he can be very abrasive with his humor, and sometimes downright mean. Husband agrees. I will have to meet his wife, who I have been told is very loud. And now I have to meet a cousin.  On top of catering to a tiny three month old human. 

Am I the asshole for not being happy with this? Husband is irritated with me and says I hate everyone in his family."	Asshole	0	0

F: Yeah, it was just a paper cut it doesn’t hurt anymore
Me: Why don’t you rip it off then?
F: I don’t have the guts **short chuckle** 
So then at recess, we were playing soccer. We play soccer really competitively sometimes and he’s really good at soccer, but this wasn’t a competitive game and like rubbing it in your face type of game. We were just playing for fun. No one was gonna trash talk. 
He took a shot at the net and missed; we were playing with clothes as our goalposts so he started celebrating, thinking he scored. After we all agreed that the shot doesn’t count, he put his arms behind his neck.  It’s like that thing soccer players do when they screw up. I quickly ran towards him from behind and ripped it off.
F: Dude what the heck! **angrily**
Me: I have the guts to rip it off.
F: Why the hell you just making me more hurt after I missed that shit?
Another friend whispers to me: Dude you shouldn’t have done that. You know how competitive he is.
I told him we were just playing at recess, and there was nothing to lose.

This week someone is coming to live there and she is going to pay 120 Euros for the 1-week stay. One of my roommates who is also (or maybe was) a good friend of mine didn't even tell me this and was planning on using the money for a speaker and other things for the house.

I am leaving in 2 months and will actually not use any of this and told him it would be better for me to have it cash and that's it, however he insists that if it wasn't for him we wouldn't have found the girl to stay in the first place and that 40 euros are not going to change my life.

However, I think it's just basically stealing.  AITA for asking this money or is he partially right?

&#x200B;

This apartment belongs to a company that rents apartments and we all pay almost the same rent. Some more or less because of our respective room sizes.  Our landlord knows about the girl and was fine with leaving us the money while we search for a long term tenant.

bzbb0p	2019-06-11 11:32:02	Secret_identity_4	AITA if I lie to my grandmother?	"(Throwaway/secret acct).  My grandmother is close to 90 years old.  I am the only one in town that helps her out, everything from shopping for her, taking care of her dog, taking her places and basically visiting her.  My mother lives 2 hours away and is always too 'busy' (even for phone calls), and my brother is 3 hours away and says the same thing.

While I'm not financially in a great place (also a single parent which may be why she does this), I don't feel that my grandmother should be giving me money to help her out - I do it because it is the right thing to do for a grandmother I love and has always been there for me growing up.  She is always trying to give me extra money when I shop for her, or she will say ""go take $xx out the acct. for whatever my son is signing up for, and so on.  I know she wants to help me but I feel guilty taking her money.

Lately when I buy something on her list, she will say ""hold on while I get the money to pay you for that"" and I will respond with ""you gave me the money already"" when she hasn't.  It might be a mild form of gaslighting, however, I'm not doing it to harm her, I just don't want to take her money.  She is living in an retirement home and I don't want her to worry about her bank account (such as running low on money).  I want her to be able to spend it on herself.  Also, retirement homes are expensive and she only has a few more years worth of money to pay for it.

And when I bring up what a chore she is I get berated by her as she claims that she is my responsibility and I have no choice in the matter. I have two much older siblings who do absolutely nothing towards my younger sister and get away with it.

AITA I kinda feel like it but my sister think and i quote ""your girlfriend is a insecure bitch"" is her exact words.




Edit: she just broke up with me over text saying her trust issues are going to get in the way of our relationship and that it's not my fault its stuff that happened to her in the past she doesn't want me to take away my culture for a highschool relationship.

bzb5hg	2019-06-11 11:15:17	Mapiesk	WIBTA if I would forbid my boyfriend's brother to visit us because of his behavior?	"I will try to keep it short - so my boyfriend's family isn't really about some close bonds. His parents divorced a long time ago and now it's mostly just him, his brother and his mum. 
I'm with my boyfriend for about 5 years and I was always fond of the good contact that I have with his family (the MIL literally treats me like a daughter!). 
However his brother is (from the lack of a better word) a total jerk when it comes to his family. He's always nice to me and I try to respect it, but he doesn't care about what his mom or brother feels. We had a nice dinner last days at our place, and he basically proceeded to have a 3 hour (sic!) monologue about him and him only. It was only about what he feels, what he wants, what he does, he criticizes everyone and everything and he's a huge supporter of animal/human rights, but yet he forgets to be decent towards his family. I felt really hurt because it was supposed to be a nice opportunity for the family to catch up (I cooked as well). And instead I feld bad at my own home. Not to mention, it was literally heartbreaking for me to see their mother just ending up being sad for no reason. Everytime someone tries to tell my boyfrien's brother to rethink what he says, he just closes himself up completely, gets super offended and the last time he literally cut himself out from the family for two years. I also don't want to create an extra drama or tension, so I didn't want to make the situation worse. 

But in the end of the day (he stayed at our place for 5 days and normally lives in a different country) I felt like he shouldn't be allowed to visit us again. I don't mind to meet him at any family event or grab a coffee together when he will be in the town, but I don't want to have such a dissrespectful and rude person under my roof anytime in the future. 


Would I be an asshole for this? How can I even say no for the next time without creating a new drama? He apparently doesn't view his actions through the same prism as we see them..."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Summer vacation is ending and my friends keep talking about missing each other and wanting to meet before school starts. 


I've always been one to be emotionally attached to people, but every time they talk about the topic I just end up ignoring the conversation. It's not like I don't love my friends anymore, but I'm really enjoying my time alone. I've been distant this whole vacation because of that. 


They've planned 4 previous meetings during the summer and I only went to one because of said reason. Now, they're planning to go out once again later in the week and I really don't want to go. There are two weeks left of vacation and I want to spend it at home, alone.


I've talked to my mother about this (asking her to give an excuse to give my friends for not coming) but she called me out on it saying that it was a very asshole-ish of me. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong with not coming and not missing them, but my mother's words are haunting me and I need another point of view. Am I a bad friend? Or am I just straight up an asshole?

Some context first: I (25M) am the oldest of seven siblings. I've got three sisters and three brothers who's ages are: 18M, 18F (twins), 15M, 13F, 9F and 6M. The twins are both currently away at uni and 15M is pretty good at doing his own thing. Our mum is a single parent, and between us we have four different dads, all of whom are terrible individuals in their own way and have nothing to do with any of us, basically. Since 13F was born, I've pretty much helped Mum raise the kids and have effectively played Dad to the three youngest. 

Recently, however (as in like, past two years or so), 9F has been exibiting some *serious* aggression and behavioural problems. This list is by no means a comprehensive list but so far she has; been suspended from school because she bit a teaching assistant hard enough that he needed stitches, been asked to leave the Brownies because she pushed one girl over and dragged another across the room by her hair, been banned from a neighbour's house because she keeps picking on their cat and destroyed her room at mum's countless times. I keep telling mum she needs to get her in therapy stat because this is only gonna get worse, but mums kinda a hippy and is ""trying a more natural, nuturing approach first"". I just can't cope with my sister and her tantrums any more. I love the kid so much, but the tantrums are happening so frequently that she's very tricky to be around these days. 

Here's the issue: I still want to help out with the 13yo and 6yo, because of course I do, they've dome nothing wrong. But there's no way I can take care of them or have them over at my place or take them anywhere without 9yo and it's gotten to a point where I can rarely do so with her, because I'm treading on egg shells and even then she usually still kicks off about something. She honestly scares me a bit. I feel bad - she is just a little girl and I know it's not her fault that mum hasn't/won't get her the help she needs and I hate that I'm effectively punishing mum and my other siblings for her behaviour but I honestly just find her so hard to cope with.

bzb29o	2019-06-11 11:05:35	nexttosecond	AITA for publicly calling out my ex. for not giving me the concert ticket she had bought me as a gift?	"Hello judgementals.

Throwaway account.

A few month ago, my then girlfriend bought us both tickets for a concert, as a birthday present for me.  It wasn't a wrapped up gift and I never received a physical ticket, but I do clearly remember the circumstances...she was very excited to be able to buy me this gift as a belated birthday present (she didn't get me anything on the actual day).

Fast forward about 3 months, we've been separated for a couple of months and I'm curious about how this will play out, since we haven't really been in contact since the breakup. On the day before the big gig, I see I facebook post from her about the going to the concert and inviting some other random to join her with the 'spare' ticket.

I understand that she might not be comfortable going to a social event with me, but I feel like she should have checked in with me about the ticket that had been promised to me.

Here's where I do behave like a bit of an asshole, I reply to the FB post with a somewhat sarcastic question about how I can pick up my birthday present ticket. She was not impressed, and sent me several messages telling my that I have been hostile, things have changed, the ticket is none of my business now, etc...and then blocking me from all communication.

I'm embarassed about my unconstructive FB reply and now I feel like I've branded myself as the jerk in the whole breakup (which until now had been reasonably amicable).

Am I the asshole for expecting her to talk to me about the ticket?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit 1: In case it's not clear... in between buying the ticket and the day of the actual concert, we broke up. The ticket had already been purchased, there was no new gift to buy..

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

I am the asshole! Case closed.

So, between me and my parents, we have two cats. One is mine (as in I rescuer her and cared for her since she was a week and a half), the others is theirs, whom they adopted when he was seven weeks old.

My parents do not like cats. In my childhood, we had two cats (they passed in 2018) that dad would torture in some way. He always enjoyed making them angry to the point of hissing/spitting and aggressive. One, he would always pull her tail and drag her close to him until she was howling.

Now! He treats their dogs and my brothers dogs amazingly well. As in deeply spoil, give a lot of treats and so on. He wasn't willing to put our elderly dog down until she couldn't even stand--but was quick to jump on putting my elderly cats down for easily fixed problems.

But he treats my girl nicer, and has become super attached to her. He gives her way too many extra treats, buys her cat toys, and so on. A clear and major change from how he treated my other cats. He has mentioned a few times she would be better in a house and not an apartment, but I want to take her with me. He's ""joked"" about hurting her to get a reaction out of me quite a few times.

However, he doesn't treat his cat as well--while he gives him extra treats, there's very little concern for him outside of if he gets injured. Tonight, he got pissed because the little boy was meowing because he wanted attention and stormed towards the cat. He always terrorizes him when he's mad. They lock my cat and theirs in the laundry room and wonder why my cat had issues with closed doors.

But it's not always like this! He's also always really nice to them too, but if they meow frequently or are just plain noisy, he gets livid.

And I'm moving in a few months and I want to bring them with me. Dad would be heartbroken over Eevee, and mom over Dusty. But they don't like cats very much and I think I'd be doing them a favor.

I would also feel guilty. So. WIBTA if I took them with me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

At work we have a baler (basically just crushes cardboard until it becomes a big block) and whatever cardboard we accumulate during work has to be thrown out by us. Everyone is supposed to do their own but this guy, lets call him Tim, never does his own. While im doing mine he silently leaves his cardboard and leaves it there until someone does it. I do it because ill get in trouble either way for just leaving it there knowing it has to be done. The thing is I dont mind doing it, but his cardboard usually has plastic in and around it that he never bothers to take off (plastic gets recycled and cant go in the baler) so i have to do it and its annoying box after box. So im thinking of doing his cardboard and not throwing out the plastic before (boxes have our section number on it so managers can clearly see its his boxes) and waiting until something is said. Since you’re supposed to do your own he’d have to admit that he doesn’t do his own, ever. I’ve mentioned to Tim that it’ll be helpful if he does this beforehand but he doesnt listen.

"Recently (1/5/19) my mothers long term partner, My step father who was a really good guy & really there for me(29) & both of my brothers, Has passed away. I live in Australia & mother lives in a Medium/small sized town In New Zealand (50,000) - (Both my Mum and Step dad were really loving kind parents.) 
While I was back for the funeral I told my mum (67yo) that I would like to move back to My home town and support her. I have come back to Australia with every intention of saving till July & moving home home at the end of July. I am a contracting carpet Layer, I am concerned that There may not be as much work there for me in such a small town. I am non stop here with my work. I just learnt my trade on the job, with out going to trade school or getting qualified, I’m sure I can still lay Carpet in New Zealand but I imagine there will be less work for me. I also have a labourer from South America, who’s a cool guy, that I’ve been training for 1 year & helping him earn points toward his visa so he can stay for good in Australia. he is going to be out of work(I am sure he will find more work).. I’ve only- this year taken him on & for the first time made over 100k after paying him.. (which is good for me considering last year I made 55k)it is going to be a massive drop in pay & also life style( I will get a job there tho, mums friend is a carpet layer and she got him to ask at some places) also.. I really enjoy living here it’s allot of fun plenty of partying & drinking with friends, mdma - my home is pretty town boring, all my mates that are still living there are cool, But just smoke reefer in their garages, it’s just not the same vibe etc.. but I also feel that money & partying is not as important as family & my mother will be left with no family back home if I don’t move ( both my brothers live here, with their kids & wife’s.) She does not wanna move away from her friends back home. (I suggested for her to move here & be closer to us.) I’m just single and I figured there was carpet to be lay there, so I said I’d go.. but Also my brothers are a little concerned that I drink to much and smoke to much pot and I will be a burden on my mum.. (mum really didn’t like that about me as I was growing up. She still doesn’t) Any way my mums now really excited about me moving back.. now , I don’t really want to.. am I the ass hole if I stay in Australia & don’t move back in to my mothers to support her."

&#x200B;

So I (M18) still live with both of my parents (F45)(M53) as well as my siblings who are both female(11 & 15). Now it has always been a good family life at home. We've had arguments just like every other family but for the most part they are more often than not solved on the same day.

Next comes my dilemma. My dad works nights so he is asleep during the day and is awake and works during the afternoon and evening. So just like any other day I'm heading out of school but as I reach the gate I realise I have left my books for chemistry that day at home. So although I will be late, at least I'll be able to learn something once back instead of missing out on a whole lesson.

Fast forward about 30 minutes and just outside my house I see my mother waiting around. This is extremely peculiar to me as she usually makes sure that the house is cleaned multiple times before work (She is extremely weird and loves cleaning.) Now she works as a teacher but on every 2nd day of the week(Monday, Wednesday and Friday) she will get to work around 11 as she cares for a special needs student who doesn't get in until this time. So I start to head over but before I reach a point where she can clearly see me, I see a man approach her, smiling at her as she smiles back. No biggie, everyone in the neighbour hood is super chill with eachother. What I saw next broke my heart.

&#x200B;

I saw her make out with the man before heading over to his house. I managed to whip out my phone and take a few pics because I didn't know what to do and I feel betrayed that she could do this to our family. Obviously there might be more to it but it makes me feel sick. I haven't yet told my dad and it's been a couple of days but it really pains me and I believe he deserves to know. But I keep thinking I'll be an asshole and potentially tear this family apart by getting involved in their relationship. They are not in an open relationship and my dad is very old fashioned with the idea that it should be two people and nothing more. I'm torn because on one hand I'm potentially breaking the family but on the other my dad is being betrayed just how she was betraying the family as a whole.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Mother has been having an affair with the neighbour when the kids are at school and Father is asleep. No one knows but I caught them and took pics."		1	0

Greg is a vegan, and feels very strongly about the topic. I have heard multiple times from him that the meat industry is the biggest cause of climate change, and he said people who drink milk scare him (but this is besides the point.)

A few weeks ago, he came into the restaurant I work at and ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla (we don’t offer vegan options.) I didn’t think anything of it till after my shift ended so when I got home I went to my sister and said “did you know Greg isn’t a vegan anymore?” And she tells me he never was and actually lies about it. Now, I don’t have a problem with this and it doesn’t offend me in any way, and I haven’t judged him for it at all.

BUT. A few nights ago, me, my two sisters, and a few of their friends (Greg included) went out to eat. Greg ordered a vegan meal and had something to say to people who ordered meat-heavy meals. This instantly made me think of when I made him a chicken quesadilla, so I mentioned it in front of the group. I could tell he was angry, and he said “that isn’t something everyone needs to know” and the rest of the dinner was very uncomfortable. I said “Greg none of us ordered vegan so we have to reason to judge you for what you eat” but he wasn’t hearing me out.

I didn’t think I did anything wrong, but my sister said “if he was lying about it for a long time then i don’t think it was something that you should just spill out like that.” I *still* don’t feel like I’m in the wrong here, so, AITA?

She mentioned that the female pupils should wear shoes with atleast with 1-inch heels.

I raised my hand and told her that the school did not inform us this, the rest of the class agreed. She told me, “You signed the contract for your enrollment and you should follow the rules of the school. Do you agree?” I nodded. She repeated the question. I nodded in agreement again. “Hmmm... It’s the first day of my class and I’m already getting some attitude.”

In my mind I was panicking and I wanted to inform her for her misunderstanding. I thought, ‘I WAS NODDING IN AGREEMENT SHE MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD.’ And I’m beginning to think that i should’ve said “yes” instead of nodding since maybe it is considered rude. I wanted to tell her but i was having trouble planning a sentence that can save my dignity.

I grew up in Utah. My mother and father were probably narcissists from what I can remember from my childhood. They were never wrong. Their issues always went before mine. They did anything they could to manipulate me just for their own joy.

I moved out as soon as I could. It was easy seeing how I didn’t have much of my own belongings. I enlisted in the Army at 18. While stationed in Washington, I risked it and sent a few letters to my parents asking for some clothes and snacks. To my surprise, they did, (This will also be important later.)

4 years later and I’m in the civilian life, though in the reserves. After going to trade school, I start up my own cannabis business in Nevada a while after legislation legalized it. I smoked pot behind my parents’ backs all the time when I was a teenager, and I’ve been into the lifestyle ever since

Now, I’m not gonna say the name of my company or who I am, making this a throwaway account, but my company became very successful within months. I made about $2 Million in almost a year.  My parents got wind of this through my Instagram account, apparently. I made the god awful mistake of bragging my company’s success on my personal page and I guess they found it.

They ask me for money because they’re in some kind of situation where they need something big paid off. They said I should pay it off because they were my parents and they “raised” me. Nope. I remember their narcissistic ways. I call them out on it, and they act like they’re innocent. They then mention when they sent me stuff while I was in the army. I didn’t care. That couldn’t make up for their shitty parenting on any day.

My brother has been acting up lately. He refuses to do his homework, study, read, and instead play video games. When I force him to do his homework, he screams at me, calls me stupid, then calls my father and lies to him (he said I hit him) and asked my father to kick me out of the house. 

My father gives in to him all the time, and when this happened, he decided to bring him out for dinner. I texted him and told him that wasn’t happening and that he was rewarding my brother’s bad behaviour. 

He told me that I’m being melodramatic and he just wants to talk to my brother. Not wanting to start a fight with my father, I relented. 

I bought myself dinner and ate at home. It was getting late, my father wasn’t home and my brother is hungry. 

He asked if he could have some of my food and I said “no”. He said that I was being mean, but I replied and said that I will not waste my money on feeding an ungrateful brat until he learns his lesson.

I said I wanted to stay in because I had a long week and we could just order food. She was like okay that’s cool, and that she thought the jazz thing sounded fun but it was up to me. 

An hour later she texted me and was like actually I want to go to this jazz thing with other people, can we move your birthday celebration? I could come over before the event or we could celebrate tomorrow. However, she knows I have a huge Master’s exam coming up and my whole weekend was planned around studying for it and this was the one night I had open. Plus she would have only been able to come over for a half hour before this event. 

So I was like um seriously? We were planning on doing this all week and now you’re ditching me because you want to go out? We got into a huge argument over it and I said it was selfish of her since she had said it was my birthday and we could do whatever I wanted and now she was ditching me. She was like I don’t know what you want, now you’re just overreacting and being mean to me and I was like, because I called you selfish for ditching me on my BIRTHDAY? Normally any other day I wouldn’t care but this was my birthday. I ended up staying in that night by myself while she went out and got drunk. 

I spoke to her yesterday and apologized saying I was extremely hurt that she cancelled on me and was really upset. All she said was thank you, hope you feel better. Didn’t apologize for her shitty behavior. And now I’m feeling even worse than before because she clearly thinks she is in the right and the only reason I apologized was because I hate having people mad at me. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bzak5d	2019-06-11 10:03:28	Sumoki_Kuma	AITA for not always greeting first?	"I live in a house with my mom, step dad and another tenant who stays inside the house. I have fairly severe social anxiety and talking to people first and starting conversations has always made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. Greeting people is always a very awkward situation for me so I generally wait for people to greet me first (might have it's roots in the notion that 'children should be seen not heard' as I grew up to believe about myself.) Another thing to note is that I also have really bad memory issues and the meds I'm on make it worse so I don't always remember whether I've greeted someone or not.

So this morning I went into the kitchen and spoke to my mom about something and the tenant (she's in her 40's) greeted me and asked me why I never greet her first and that I make her feel like I don't see her (I never ignore her and when I'm in a good enough mood and I see her first I will generally say hi even if I dont want to) 

My step-dad had the same problem with me when he first moved in until he spoke to my mom about it and I could explain to her how my social anxiety gets in the way of common decency sometimes and I can't really help it, and since then if I'm in a room and don't greet him first he'll loudly say 'GOOD MORNING!' (or whichever time of day it is) in a chirpy tone which makes me feel so much better and relieved.

bzajxj	2019-06-11 10:02:37	edwrdtylor	AITA for trying to speak to the first girl I slept with?	"&#x200B;

About 2 years ago I (19M) started speaking to a girl (18F) who followed me on Instagram through mutual friends. We will call her Ruby. We soon became good friends and spoke almost every day (general friendly conversation as well as flirty messages) on snapchat and facetime, for the best part of 6 months. Ruby asked if I wanted to stay over at hers, and whilst nervous since I had never really stayed at a girl’s house before I obliged. She lives an hour or so away by train.

The day comes around and were on her sofa watching a movie. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together. I go home the next day, and all is well. Soon after Ruby and I began to drift apart and messages naturally ended around a week later. I soon see via her Instagram that she had got a boyfriend. We’ll call him Sam.

Sam ended up blocking my Instagram and snapchat on her phone, which I found out several months later when trying to reach out to ask how she was. I brushed it off and moved on with life.

Several days ago I see on another mutual friends snapchat picture of one of Rubies’ best friends. I sent the girl who posted the picture a message asking if she knew Ruby. She said she did and I asked her if she could get Ruby to unblock me since I wanted reach out to see how she was. She said yes. 15 minutes later I receive a message saying “She doesn’t want to speak to you. Leave her and her boyfriend alone.” Whilst being kinda down, I acknowledged the message and moved on.

Soon after this I had this exchange with Sam on Instagram;

[https://imgur.com/KD1vRGk](https://imgur.com/KD1vRGk)

And that was it. He blocked my Instagram and the next day I woke up to a message from the mutual friend on snapchat telling me to that I need to stop contacting them or Ruby will call the police.

Am I the asshole for trying to reach out to her? Or not?

Edit: I should make it clear that I in no way want a romantic relationship with her. I just wish I could speak to her about how her family is and how her exams and stuff went.

I get the impression that her bf is controlling just by his activity on her social media and shutting down anyone who tries to speak to her."	Asshole	0	0

I always ask my gf if she wants some, she says no because ‘she is trying to be healthy’ and then ends up eating 3-4 slices. It’s annoying, and I have told her to stop many times but she hasn’t. One day I got off early and I saw an opportunity to teach her a lesson. I order a very very spicy pizza, get home and lace it with more extremely spicy sauce I have. I then move all the drinks into the garage fridge and all the cups out of her reach, i keep one water bottle if things go wrong. She gets home and does the same thing “oh I’m just gonna be naughty and have a piece hahaha’. Anyway she has the pizza and it is way too spicy for her that she has trouble breathing and her nose bleeds a bit. This went wrong so I got more drinks and some tissues to fix her up. I was like, sorry I tried to teach you a lesson but it went south. She is very mad and just stopped talking to me. AITa in this situation?	Asshole	0	0

bzaigq	2019-06-11 09:57:45	Kimonaize	AITA for not wanting to visit my grandma?	"I am having trouble figuring out whether I am being rational or completely batshit insane, so please indulge me.

I am on summer break from uni till the beginning of August, and my dad really wants us to fly to my home-state to visit his mother, who is pushing 90 soon. I'm not really keen on doing that. I've had problems with my grandma since I was very little, because she used to ""discipline"" me crudely and harshly for doing the things that little kids tend to do, like refuse to eat a certain vegetable or squealing too loudly. For instance, when I was about five, my grandma made a dish of boiled bananas for breakfast. When I ate that, I got sick, so my mum asked her to lay off the bananas the next time around. Literally three days later, there were boiled bananas on the table, and I refused to eat them. My grandma blew her top and screamed at me for being an ungrateful brat who needs a beating: ""how can you speak to your own grandmother like this"", ""you must obey your elders"", etc. Being a dumb baby, I stuck my tongue out at her and fled, only to be caught, unceremoniously brought back to the house and lectured loudly by her with my parents and all my relatives observing, choosing to remain mum.

It's a decent description of the past 19 years, plus the fact that any perceived ""disobedience"" of my parents was described by her as ""disrespect of \[her\] son"". She also used to travel north to meet us, where she often pulled a very annoying stunt of both being a guest and ""the head of the house"" to evict me from the sofa, or the dining table, or intrude into my personal affairs. A more recent slight was when she convinced my dad that I should not go to UC Berkeley for an undergrad maths degree because ""all the children \[my cousins\] are leaving the country, and what will a little girl do on her own"" -- which is why I'm in a local college now. I'm still very salty about that.

I've been trying to put my foot down, but I'm not financially independent, and decisions are usually made without my input. Last year I was effectively dragged there after some tepid complaining, where I was greeted with mouldy, stale food -- and more boiled bananas. Meanwhile, my grandma would sleep, eat, cook and watch TV all day, pausing only to comment on my general unhelpfulness around the house.

My dad's surprised and upset, despite the fact that I have been complaining for the last 16 years. He says that my grandma's protective of me and has done a lot for me, like set up a trust fund of sorts for my education (which I found out about today) and ""including me in her prayers"". Moreover, she's old and needs people around, and her age has mellowed her sharp tongue significantly. But I'm trying to be firm this time. I don't know if she has really changed for the better, but I sure as hell don't want to stick around to witness it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I forgot that I had excised my mother's stand on this whole shebang. She's siding with me, because she has had bad experiences with my grandma, too. She thinks that my grandma's general dismissal of her spilled over to me, which I have no way to verify or refute."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bzaevr	2019-06-11 09:44:40	LeahDragon	AITA for asking my father to use neutral language when referring to me because I’m non-binary?	"So for context I came out at 17 and I’m now 22, so this has been an issue for over 5 years and about a week ago I blew up about it after constant jokes and ridicule regarding the situation.
I’m not one of the super offended SJW types. I don’t correct every person I see, I just ask that the people close to me refer to me neutrally and depending on their level of acceptance also ask them to refer to me as they/them as well.
My parents and me never had the best relationship due to an extremely abusive childhood I’d rather not get into. 
In relation to my father I only ask for him to:
1. Stop making a joke out of my situation 
2. Refer to me as his child
3. Stop saying I will ‘always be his daughter’ which he always says despite saying that if I were FTM he would respect me as a son but he can’t respect me as being non-binary.

I haven’t enforced pronouns with him. I haven’t asked him to use my preferred name. All I ask is that he doesn’t constantly ridicule me and refers to me neutrally and doesn’t constantly tell me I’m a woman/his daughter and always will be unless I’m FTM and then he would consider me his son.

He had used various excuses like he ‘doesn’t understand,’ and ‘it’s a phase,’ and it’s a ‘generation thing’ but my mother, grandparent and even my partners 60+ year old parents refer to me neutrally and even use my preferred name in place of pronouns (they can’t quite grasp they/them but they tried) and even my partners 95 year old grandmother tried her best too. All of them use neutral language, preferred name and pronouns/name in place of pronouns so I don’t get why it is hard for a 46 year old to just stop calling me his daughter after 5 years of this shit and constant ridicule.

As I the asshole for finally putting my foot down and telling him I can’t accept this behaviour any longer and that I’ve given him 5 years to adjust and sting  at this point it is obvious he just has no respect for who I am and what I’d like to be called?

This causes me a lot of dysphoria and I just don’t need people like him in my life constantly telling me I’m basically ‘fake’ when he’s never been a great father to me anyway."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Manipulative in many ways, i think physically abusive also. They don't get along very well, but my F attempts to be civil and includes her in life events. I have met FMIL a few times, she is awkward and twitchy and we don't share a fluent language but, she seems just friendly odd. But, I have seen her FMIL manipulate situations to focus on her and unrelated things about herself whilst in an event that she invited us to that wasn't about her at all. If she came to the wedding, FMIL and Fs Dad would be in the same room, and that doesn't happen ever, and FMIL would only know Fs sister. So, I don't want a scene at my wedding. And apparently that is possible. i don't want my wife to be stressed on a day that all her favourites are gathered around her, but she feels... like she has to invite FMIL because..... its her mum right? My parents won't be there because we will have a second ceremony in my home country. I am super comfy with her coming to the ceremony. She should be there. She is a part of our lives. But our reception will be small, because of money and tradition, and I would prefer there to be less likely hood of public freakout. So if F wants her there, I'm all about it.

bza9ja	2019-06-11 09:24:46		AITA for telling my anti-vax mom to stop buying me herbal supplements?	"Im 21F in college, completely financially dependent on my parents. When I was 7 I was diagnosed with ADHD. My parents (mom mainly) resorted to herbal supplements, hyperbaric chamber therapy, electric shock therapy, vitamin b12 shots into my asscheeks - all of this at home.

Since i’m dependent - even tuition - I’ve let my parents handle my ADHD. It directly correlates to my school performance, which they’ve invested in. I used to be too scared to talk about it but recently I’ve opened up to my mom about my issues and how supplements don’t work. Classes are getting harder and I’m struggling. I told her I really think I need meds, which horrifies her. She said I’m an adult and I can get meds but I should keep trying her supplements.

I’m home for the summer now, she’s been really pushing it. Last week yelled at me for forgetting to take the supplements, yesterday and today she bought 2 more new ones. I told her i’m tired of taking these, I will be getting prescribed meds next week hopefully, covered by my insurance. She told me I should at least *try* supplements and she won’t give up until then. We started arguing, I told her they’re very expensive ($30-40 a bottle) and she just needs to stop. She told me it’s her money and she doesn’t care. I asked where her research came from - she said TACA, a non profit anti-vax autism org, along with my childhood ADHD physician who disagrees with medication. I told her none of this has any scientific proof, her “research” is hypocritical, and I won’t take them. She got extremely upset and stormed out.

bza8zk	2019-06-11 09:22:36		WIBTA if I ask my mother to stop smoking weed?	"Obligatory apology for format, on mobile.

So basically my mother has a habit of smoking a LOT of weed. From my estimate it's at least $200 worth a week, which is a large portion of her income. The most annoying thing is, she buys it several times a week in small increments which costs a lot more. I've offered to get someone to sell her larger quantities to save money, but she always refuses.
She is constantly borrowing money from me for more, which in all fairness, she pays back pretty consistently, however I just don't like it in principle.
Basically we're pretty poor because of this, combined my mother's spending habits. 
I always ask her to start buying healthier foods because I've been gaining a lot of weight recently, but she just complains she can't afford it, so I asked her to just start giving me the money she'd otherwise spend on food for me to go shopping myself. However the one time she actually did give me the money, before I even had the opportunity to go to the grocery store she asked if she could have it back to buy weed.

I get that its her money, but I'm really sick of having to eat instant mac and cheese for alot of my meals, I'm gaining weight and feel like shit.

"After picking up her instagram 'influencer' bff from the airport and driving her around all weekend. She proceeded to talk (only) about herself, ignore any conversation topics my gf brought up, make my gf take instagram photos (and stop her to 'teach' her how), brag about freeloading, cheat on her relationship, make me and my flatmates listen to her relationship problems and after all of this not even thank me for hosting or providing food.

&#x200B;

I let my girlfriend know I did not like her privately on Sunday and didn't appreciate being third-wheeled in my own relationship, especially when she knew I wouldn't see her for the next three weeks (we are long distance), that I would continue to drive her around but I would not be her friend. She has a bad history with an emotionally manipulative best friend and I am concerned that this has the potential to turn in the same situation.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend understood where I was coming and returned home yesterday and then posted on instagram today saying how amazing it was spending the weekend with her. I got heated and messaged her saying she is very clearly a narcissist and I refuse to be her friend and that she should seriously reconsider it too. My girlfriend said she is starting to see her tendencies but she would be there for her when she needs the attention... Which is always.

bza7qj	2019-06-11 09:17:50		AITA for snitching on my coworkers?	"Backstory: I work in a large medical establishment with 10+ other women. Our manager is an amazing lady who is also a great friend to me, she is a fair and lovely leader and I respect her a great deal. The two coworkers in this I shall refer to as PJ and Ali. 


So, PJ and I have some history as we used to work in a different establishment together. We HATED each other, as she as always been a bit of a bitch (excuse me). She liked to instigate shit and I am more of a quiet person at work.


So we have now been working together at the new place for a few months now and have been getting on pretty well, and she found a ""best friend"" in Ali, another co-worker. They like to spend their free time bitching about other co-workers, often in front of me. I choose to ignore it because I don't like to be a part of things like that. Anyhow for some reason they really started to take a shine to me and we actually had a lot of fun at work. All is good.


Anyway - in the past few weeks they've been saying they're going to quit because Manager and other co-workers are so annoying, bla bla. Now, like I mentioned, Manager is amazing and is always trying to make sure everyone is happy. So naturally this really pissed me off. I tried to ignore it because it isn't really my business. 


Until sometime last week a colleague from the old establishment texted me saying rumours are going around, and that everyone knows that PJ and Ali are going to quit their jobs because because the establishment sucks ass and so does the Manager. (The people from the previous establishment know her also.) That place was AWFUL and that anyone there is even hearing anything about us is a horrible thought for me.


Now that pretty much pissed me off. Especially because PJ and Ali are scheduled to go through very expensive training, paid for by our bosses. So it seemed to me like they were only waiting to get their training paid for and to then book it. I told Manager about it. She said she would not name me as the person who told her.


Fast forward to this morning and those two are looking DAGGERS at me. Oh shit. So Manager told them that it was me who snitched (great) as they directly asked if it was me. They basically said that I am a liar, got extremely aggressive and asked how anyone could be so dumb as to tell the manager something like that. So yeah. They are definitely going to try and make my life hell from now on, so I have that to look forward to. I also feel pretty shitty about snitching.


So. AITA for snitching? Will I deserve the wrath? I just want my peace and to get work done.


TL;DR My coworkers kept saying they wanted to quit because everything sucks (despite the expensive training they are about to have paid for), so much so that my shitty old workplace heard of it. I told the Manager and now I am probably destined to be Mean Girl'd into all eternity."		1	0
bza4ru	2019-06-11 09:06:12		AITA for kicking my abusive dad out of my life even though he is struggling?	"I'm a 22yo female, and I'm studying to become a university teacher. I have two little brothers (less than 13yo). 
My father has always been abusive with me and my mom. He never ever worked. He had a pretty rough life, his mom kicked him out at 15. He then met my mom, who always was a hard working woman. My dad never worked, always found excuses, so he basically was living off of my mom for like 20 years. He then started to become abusive (physically and mentally) with her and me. My mom didn't left him because she thought that my brothers still needed a dad (and she's really afraid of him). She then left him 2 years ago.
My mom is working for the government, so she's outside of the country with my brothers, while I'm studying in our country, and my dad is leaving there at my mom's place (in another city, thank God). He's not working, and my mom isn't giving him any money. I cutted all ties with him. He doest have any savings, and my mom kicked him out of her place (which is perfectly normal in my opinion).
I have savings for my studies, and my brothers think I'm a big time asshole for not helping out my dad who's basically starving. They think that I should give him a second chance. They went to see him, and he is apparently getting really skinny and he is still in my mom's house, without any electricity or water. My bros think that 'he is still my dad' and I should help him. 
But I don't want to help a man who spend most of my childhood abusing me physically and mentally (once he broke one of my ribs), and who is so manipulative with everyone. 
I have to add that he is a 46 years old healthy man. And when they divorced, my mom gave him 3000€ so he could start over.

"I had planned a trip to Oregon to watch the Solar Eclipse with my  friends and I , maybe myself and 2 others to only have them invite everyone. What should have been a group of 3 people became 8 and I  found myself organizing every facet of the trip which was something I  did not appreciate having to do at the time. Not only that they wanted  to derail all of the plans by veering to do their own things. During  that trip a few of my friends wanted to smoke weed , which I am ok with ,  ive smoked weed in the past here and there and Im not going to stop  them HOWEVER I was against them smoking inside the AirBnB we were  staying at because it was against the AirBnBs rules AND as he has said  he (owner) was going to check in on us once later that night. I was a  bit paranoid and told them to wait until after the owner did his check  up and to smoke outside which lead to hurt butts because they wanted to  smoke inside and they began calling me a nazi for wanting them to smoke  outside. All of this was on my name BTW but they all equally paid for  it. Nothing ended up happening at the end but they were mad that I was  so uptight in trying to follow the rules. This was something that  happened over 2 years. One of the people calling me a nazi was the said  mutual friend of my ex-GF. I had brought this trip up to my girlfriend casually reminiscing me going on trips with this said mutual friend as we have had other trips which I fondly remember. My now EX has ghosted  our mutual for little over a year now for reasons that get complicated.  When I had brought this thing up she had mentioned that she had spoken  to our mutual friend about his side of the story. When I asked her about  what our mutual friend had thought about me and the trip she told me  ""You dont need to know, that was a conversation that happened between me  and him."". For me it wasn't enough to hear that sentence and wanted a  reasoning as to why she did not want to tell me. She insisted  passionately that,""she doesn't haven't to tell me period and that  should be the end of that"". My reasoning is if it wasn't such a big deal  and something that happened years ago with someone she doesnt even talk  to anymore then it should be a trivial thing to tell me but the fact  that there was so much resistance made me feel insecure which is  something I brought up to her and she still held her position. She  brought up that she doesn't like to gossip but she has gossiped about  many people in the past and recent times with me about said friend and I  called her out on it. She continued to bring up that she shouldnt have  to tell me. Which to a certain extent I understand, I dont need to know  everything about her and every facet of her life but this should be something trivial and yet there is so much resistance.  At this point it  made us reevaluate why we are in the relationship and that she does not  want to be in a relationship where ""she has to tell me every little thing about her life"".

 I'm 26. Disabled. I walk with a cane. 

My parents have ALWAYS been shitty at supporting me. But thats okay because I have a great boyfriend and Im slowly regaining my independence. I have learned to have a relationship with them from afar with boundaries. 

Finally after 5 years I get a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, it felt scary but validating. I was also told to continue with neurologist with MS testing jic, which is also scary. I'll know for sure in August.

I told my bf and dad and they were both supportive.

And then there was my Mom.

My Mom has always been off. I love her a lot but she does things that don't make sense. She has a fetish for sympathy. 

She said she was happy for me and left it at that. But then next day she calls me. Going on and on about how bad she hurts and how she's terrified. She says she knows its fibro, or maybe cancer. I keep telling her she needs to go to the doctor because I've been telling her for YEARS she needs to go just for a general check up. I shrugged it off at first.

She's since started this health brigade, talking about her ""journey"" and how hard she has it. She's telling everyone the things I thought she was ignoring all this time when I tried to vent to her, and instead parroting them as if they are her own problems.

Days after my diagnosis.

Then one day my stepdad mentions fibro to his secretary (not about me, about her) and the secretary goes ""oh isn't that the disorder where people are crazy and think they're in pain?"" And my mom tells me this, not to say she's angry for me, to say verbatim ""nobody understand what I'M GOING THROUGH""

I've tried so hard to believe her, but she's never complained of these issues before and its as if she's reading them off my own life script. She called me wasted again and said this time its lyme disease or MS, and that she's not ""webMDing herself just educating"". She did end up seeing a doctor at least. 

And then I'm left here feeling a couple different ways. One, that its hard to believe that she suddenly, days after my diagnosis developed my same exact symptoms that I had for YEARS but were disregarded ny my parents. That I feel like my experiences, what I've been through, and my identity is being trivialized and stripped for attention. And two, if she is actually suddenly sick, that I'm gatekeeping and being shitty to her. Thing is I wouldn't care if she didn't steamroll over me all the time and asked about me.

bz9zxo	2019-06-11 08:47:03	thowveryfaraway	WIBTA for not wanting a family member to attend a graduation event?	"I'm graduating from college soon, which I'm really excited about. I was feeling pretty aimless and like I hadn't really accomplished anything noteworthy, but today I found out that I was selected to receive one of the awards my department hands out at the graduation ceremony. I'm super thankful to have been selected and I called my mom as soon as I found out to tell her the good news.

Here's the issue: the department is hosting a small party before the actual graduation ceremony to celebrate all the award winners. I'm invited, along with the professor who nominated me, and my family. Normally, that would mean both my parents and my younger sibling, but my paternal grandmother also happens to be visiting.

I have no relationship with her whatsoever. I've seen her maybe four times total in my entire life, and never for longer than a few hours at a time. For context, my family is based in the US and my extended family (including her) is based in Asia. Her visit to us is the longest I've ever seen or interacted with her, and I dislike her immensely. 

My father was her least favorite child, but seeing as he's done pretty well for himself, so he's been supporting her and his other siblings (and their children) for several years. That's not the problem, though. In fact, I'm proud of him for helping his family, and I would like to think if my parents or sibling were ever having difficulties, I would help them out too.

My paternal grandmother is absolutely VILE to my mother. She constantly talks down to her and belittles her. She always badmouths my mother's family, who are all lovely people. She criticizes my mom's cooking and how she runs the household. Every time I've gone home for a visit, I find my mom really stressed and upset, but my dad doesn't help AT ALL. In fact, he's always working so my mom has to act as a caretaker to my grandmother, and it stresses her out a lot. 

My grandmother also actively ignores me (which I don't mind at all), but then constantly complains to my dad that *I* ignore *her* or that I'm rude to her. This has caused more than a few arguments between me and my dad. She also has major issues with how my parents treat me and my brother (i.e. paying for our educations, giving us nice clothes and technology etc.) and complains that my dad doesn't give *enough* money to the rest of his family (i.e. her and her other kids) even though my dad is paying the college tuition of one of my cousins.

There's a lot more stuff, but I won't get into it here.

In light of how little I like her, I really don't want her to attend the party my department is hosting for me. It might be irrational, but I worry that she's somehow going to ruin the experience. WIBTA for bringing it up to my dad that I don't want her at the event? She'd still be at the graduation ceremony since there's no way to exclude her from that, but I'd rather enjoy the party without her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bz9xng	2019-06-11 08:37:39	canigetayeeehaaawww	AITA for not hanging out with my best friend who is my neighbor when I said I was going to?	"Recently my best friend came home from college and really wanted to see me because it had been more than 6 months since I had seen her. I am still in school but I happened to be coming home that weekend for my boyfriends birthday so I said the day I wasn’t going to be hanging out with him that I would hang out with her. I just got home from college and wasn’t feeling too great so I decided to nap for a little before going to see my boyfriend. 

After waking up I was feeling a bit better and drove to pick my boyfriend up and take him to a basketball game that I purchased tickets to a long time ago. Once we got there I started to feel very sick and wanted to go home. I chose to stay because I spent over $600 on those tickets but the entire time I was shaking and coming close to throwing up. After the game I drove home and threw up all night.

The next morning I took my temperature and had a 104 fever. I knew that I would not be able to hang out with her but I thought she would understand. So I text her and tell her that I’m throwing up and I wouldn’t be able to hang out. 
Side note: her family is really weird about her getting sick so I didn’t want to invite her over and make her parents mad.
She never responds to me and I just assume that everything is okay because at that point I was so exhausted and needed as much sleep as I could get before having to return to school. 

My boyfriend decided to show up and surprise me with soup and things because of how sick I was the day before. So he spent the day taking care of me. 

Later that evening I receive a text from my friend basically calling me out for being a flake. I explain to her that I felt sick and didn’t want to get her sick as well. And they she mentions that she saw my boyfriends car outside my house and she knew that I chose to hang out with him instead of her. I try to explain that that is not the case at all but she doesn’t want to believe me. AITA for not just hanging out with her and biting the bullet?

Edit: when I say “spent the day” I mean he came over after work at like 4pm and stayed until I left at around 7pm

bz9wox	2019-06-11 08:33:54		AITA for blowing up on my sister about my physique?	"On friday my family and I got together for dinner at my parents house. When I say family I just mean my parents, 1 full brother, 1 half brother, 1 half sister and my aunt.

We were having a nice dinner as we always do. When we got to the end of the meal my sister asked if I wanted to finish off her plate for her. She always does this as she knows I love my moms cooking and don't get it often enough to ever satiate myself. I've always been on the skinnier side and have a high metabolism (M, 25, 6'2"", 180lbs, 12.7% body fat percentage.

Anyways, I gladly accept her offer, and after I do this my sister makes a comment about me being the family garbage disposal. This was not meant to be mean as she's called me this for a long time and we find it funny. She then proceeded to say I was lucky to have such a high metabolism and be able to eat whatever I want without worrying about gaining weight.

The whole family laughed in agreement while I let out a small grin and stayed quiet. They all continued to talk about how I definitely got the lucky draw from my dad. He's also very fit for his age (71). I never smiled or added to the conversation, because the truth is that I fucking train hard and eat right 5 days out of the week. I plan my workouts every Sunday. I count my calorie and protein intake daily. I guzzle water. It's fucking hard to manage it all, but the rewards are well worth it to me.

My sister eventually asked why I was being so quiet. I replied it was nothing just tired from driving and eating, but she prodded so I essentially explained the last sentence of the above paragraph to her, and said that I didn't appreciate being told I was lucky considering that I put so much time, effort, and money into my body. At this point I would have gladly just accepted an apology and moved on as she probably was not aware of this, but instead she told me I needed to lighten up and learn to take a joke. I said I was perfectly comfortable with letting them have their fun while I drank my Guinness in silence. I only piped up because she insisted. She then said that I was being immature and she didn't feel like an apology was necessary and to get over myself.

At this point I was just done. I thanked my mother for the food, and said goodbye. I then drove the 1.5 hours back to where I go to college. I originally planned to stay the weekend with all of them. My family called me constantly while I blasted Pantera and ignored them. When I got home I had several missed calls and a thousand texts. I only responded to my mom and brothers as I felt they didn't do anything wrong necessarily. I did not respond to my sister and I left it at that for the night. She apparently was very upset that I wouldn't speak to her. I just didn't care. Since then I have texted her and said I was still willing to shake hands and hug it out if she wanted to apologize. She never responded. Am I the asshole here, reddit?"		1	0

I'm really glad I did it, but being so far from my family and friends is rough sometimes. I don't have any friends unless you count coworkers, and I spend all my time either alone, with my partner, or at work. It's really taking a toll on my mental health. I've been crying a lot because I feel super isolated. I figured adopting a pet could really benefit me, so I asked my partner. We're renting a place from his parents, so he told me it was up to them. They told me no, they don't want any animals inside their property. I understand, so I asked if we could get a rabbit if I paid and built a rabbit hutch and run outside (there's a ton of land so it would be fine). Still, they said no. I didn't want to seem like a brat so I dropped it. I've been feeling even lonelier lately so I asked if I could get a mouse. They said no, because they're gross. AITA for asking? I understand that it isn't my house.... I don't know, I don't want to seem manipulative by telling them that I'm so lonely. I don't want to seem like a spoiled brat who won't stop until she gets what she wants either. Opinions? :(		1	0

The idea of spending several nights in each of their houses keeps me up at night and has made me cry on multiple occasions just thinking about it. I tried talking to my parents about my feelings in an adult matter, but they just shut me down saying that we have to go.

bz9q5y	2019-06-11 08:07:53		AITA for not supporting the birth of my husband's first grandchild?	"Ok long story ahead guys so I'll try to keep it as succinct as possible. TL;DR at end.

My husband has two sons from his first marriage. Their mother is an out of control alcoholic and so are the boys who are 25 and 24.

The 24 year old was in fact kicked out of the army at the end of last year due to his alcoholism, but just before that happened, he was on leave and went back to his hometown where he had dinner and as he described it, ""friendly mate sex"" with his ex-girlfriend, despite already being in another relationship (which led to that one ending as well). So he managed to get his ex pregnant, then was kicked out of the army and upon both of those things happening at the same time, he (did something I can't mention without having my post locked, but you can probably guess) but luckily it wasn't a successful attempt. He currently has no job and was in a new relationship with a girl who tried really hard to come around to the idea of there being a baby in his life but decided she couldn't cope and left him on the day his ex went into labour (Sunday).

My husband found out yesterday that the baby was born and was very excited and couldn't understand why I wasn't jumping for joy about it. I was pretty blunt and told him that I felt sorry for the baby, being born to a 24 year old alcoholic who can't currently support it (just two days before the birth he told his father that he was regularly borrowing money from his mother for rent and often going without meals), and a mother who is the sort of person who doesn't see a problem with having a baby with an alcoholic ex. She's in her early 20's too and I figured she was probably in love with the idea of having a baby but that will defuse once she realises what having a baby involves and will probably unload it on her own parents when it all gets too much for her.

From my point of view, I have two friends who are in stable loving relationships who have been trying to have children for at least the last year and have been suffering through medical problems and miscarriages. My heart hurts for them and like many things in life, it is so unfair that my husband's son can have a baby without any trouble at all when he really isn't in a position to provide for another human life.

My husband rang me earlier and asked if I wanted to travel with him on the weekend to see the baby (about 500km away) and I declined, later telling him that I think he and his son should have some one on one time. I would love to be able to support them but I'm really struggling to see where the up-side in this is. It's definitely not the baby I have a problem with. It can't help the situation it's been born into. I just can't get my head around how to be positive in a situation where two people have created a life when they can't even support themselves.

bz9oho	2019-06-11 08:00:54		AITA for telling my therapy client that her parents didn't mean to project her anxieties onto her?	"Long story short, I'm a therapist that's seen a 19 year old girl for about 10 sessions. She has some heavy baggage caused by her emotionally abusive parents and by a coworker of mine who has since left the practice (as the coworker had to relocate with her family to another city). 

Her parents have always expected her to be perfect in all aspects and have emotionally abused/neglected her, and my other coworker pushed her too hard/made it seem like she didn't understand my client's situation. 

My former client (today was our last session) has been pissed at me ever since I had to cancel a session (I was sick that day). Her resentment just built and built--to the point where she said that I could not possibly understand her cultural background (she is Asian-American and I am Caucasian) and that she had an extremely substandard experience with me. I tried to say that I had felt a genuine connection with her (she goes to the same college I graduated from, Berkeley), but she retorted back that she didn't feel it and that many others besides me had also graduated from Cal. 

Afterwards, I told her that perhaps she just didn’t want to feel connected with me. 

But where she really started sounding pissed at me was when she brought up that I had once said that ""her mom didn't mean to project her anxieties onto her."" My client's mom often makes comments like, ""if you do [something she doesn't like], [my client] won't succeed/graduate from college/achieve a dream of hers."" Her mom once called my client out for randomly touching her hair and said that her “poor social skills” would prevent her from getting a job. 

My client basically said that I was making excuses for her abusive parents by saying that ""they didn't mean to."" She said that she didn't care about what they meant to do or not because she was irreparably damaged by it. I tried to tell my client that she had misunderstood me; I was just trying to offer an alternate perspective and get my client to empathize with her parents instead of villainizing them. 

She ended the session by saying that I had failed as a therapist by making her feel misunderstood and alone. I apparently did not share enough about myself about her (in my defense, the sessions were about her and not me) and failed to validate that her parents were emotionally abusive (I have never outright stated that they were abusive but have empathized with her about how terribly she felt afterwards). 

I also offered to help her look for a new therapist in Berkeley, but she told me that my colleague and I had forever ruined therapy for her, as she felt even more traumatized leaving our practices. 

After the session, I took a long break because I felt so emotionally drained. I tried not to think about it and convinced myself that sometimes, there’s just too much baggage in people to deal with, even as a therapist. 

However, I can’t stop wondering whether I was a jerk for saying that her parents didn’t mean to act so terribly towards her. AITA?"		1	0

I eventually told her that it had nothing to do with her and to mind her own business, yet she continued asking anyway.

Tonight she texted me asking me again saying that she “is trustworthy and won’t tell anyone”. I told her “maybe but it doesn’t matter, please stop asking me personal questions in class because it’s making me uncomfortable”

She said “ok then i’ll never speak to you again”

bz9lxd	2019-06-11 07:50:45		AITA for not wanting my SO's last name when we get married?	"My SO and I have been together almost 18 years. There's no big reason we haven't gotten married already, we're just lazy non-sentimental types and saw no practical reason to before this. But now, I own my own business and not filing jointly is a huge pain. Additionally, our parents have all passed away now, and we're at that age where we need to be legally tied to one another in the event of an emergency, medical or otherwise.

We're not making a big deal out of it. We both agreed we want as little fuss as possible, so we're doing the bare minimum; a begrudging courthouse ceremony. And actually, we're bummed we can't have even less fuss.

However, he recently asked me if I was taking his last name. I've made my feelings on this clear for quite a long time, and he's always seemed fine with my feelings on the matter. Perhaps he thought once it happened, I'd feel differently, I'm not sure. But I told him I'm keeping my last name. A big part of that is that I think the tradition is an antiquated patriarchal notion that has no real function anymore. Why should a woman be expected to give up a huge part her identity and heritage to assume his, instead? I can understand if you're having children and starting a family (we never had children and never will), wanting a single last name for everyone. But even then, why it's expected of the woman to take his last name is beyond me.

But a bigger reason is that his last name belonged to his father, who abandoned my SO and his mother when he was only an infant. My SO hates his father. The guy was a real ass. He was not involved in my SO's life whatsoever, beyond being a huge source of resentment. my SO's last name has never seemed like a huge part of identity.

On the flip side, my dad died of cancer when I was 10, and we were close. My last name ties me to him, my mother, and my siblings. It means a lot to me. My parents are dead now, and most of my siblings are estranged. It's all I have left of my sense of family, and it's a big part of my identity. Why should I give that up to adopt the name and heritage of some sperm donor that had no place in my SO's life?

My SO was not an asshole about it, but he did seem hurt that I wasn't willing to take his name. I told him he could take mine, but that idea doesn't appeal to him at all. Maybe I'm being ungenerous, but if it's not about us having a unified family name, then I can only come to the conclusion that this name-taking thing is more about the gendered tradition aspect, which is an even harder pass for me.

Anyway, I don't think ITA for not choosing to take his name. That is my right and choice, and I think I have pretty sound reasoning. But I wouldn't mind hearing other perspectives that I maybe haven't seen before, from a more emotionally distanced place. I don't want to hurt my SO :("	No A-holes here	1	0

My parents cut me off for marrying my husband as he is of a different religion. Husband hasn't exactly been thrilled with this but has never expressed any great animosity towards them. I don't hate my parents at all for this, in fact i want them back in my life. But obviously my husband is a priority. 

I am in contact with my little sister who lives with my parents so I send them presents often through her (the only way I can communicate with them as they won't talk to me). I don't know what they do with them (my sister says they use some stuff if it's absolutely necessary but mostly even she doesn't know if they throw it away or what) but i love gift giving and its enough for me to just do what I can. In the last year I got a very high paying job so i decided to buy them more expensive gifts for an upcoming religious festival. It was about 2000 euros in total, mostly electronics.

My husband has never had a problem with this until this time when he found out how much I'd spent. He said they didn't deserve it and I didn't need to spend from our savings and that was basically a trips worth of money that I ""threw away money on people who didn't want me anyway"". That they didnt even appreciate me so how could they appreciate the stuff and it probably ended up in the garbage. I was very hurt (still am to be honest). He was very angry but has now apologized saying he overreacted. But I did think maybe I was in the wrong. That his reaction was justified and I wondered if I truly was an asshole for not consulting him. He says he would have reluctantly given in if I talked to him abt it before. But I didn't intentionally keep this from him, I genuinely thought he wouldn't care. I never went into detail abt how much it was, he never asked mostly cause it never really came up.  We are not in a financially unstable position. In fact we r doing pretty well that's why I spent that much in the first place. This didn't hurt finances. I don't mind consulting him in the future but at the same time I feel like I dont NEED his permission. I guess cause we share finances and have shared bank account (how he found abt the amount) and etc so maybe it was wrong?

Idk I'm boggled let me know

I was starting to talk to a fellow coworker and I started to believe we were becoming friends. We talked about basic stuff like videogames, and college, and helped each other without asking when needed while at work. While talking about college, he said that his parents have always done his taxes and FAFSA for him. But this year they refused to help him with it. I offered to help him with it outside of work, and show him how to do both of those.

 The next week I asked him if he wanted to hang out outside of work  he responded with ""I don't hang outside of work with coworkers because I find that weird, and I only spend free time with my girlfriend."" So I started to debate on pulling my offer on helping him with his taxes and FAFSA. 

I don't want to waste my own free time helping someone when they are only interested in getting help from me. But do not want to hang out or spend time with me with nothing to gain. I only offered to help him because I considered us, friends. But if I am just a coworker to him, I really don't want to help him.

My wife and I have been together since high school and so have the bride and groom, we actually went to prom together (7 years ago). She was in the wedding party and helped plan and coordinate a lot of the things for the wedding. Anyways,

The wedding was tons of fun and everyone was getting along great. I wasn’t planning on staying at the hotel where everyone was staying but decided to say fuck it and have a good time. I figured I’d just get a room wherever everyone else is going. 

The ceremony ended and we all walked over to a bar to have some more drinks. The groom ends up getting a little too drunk, starts getting pissed at everyone and says he’s gonna drive home because he doesn’t want to stay at the hotel. We end up finding him a ride and so he leaves...without his wife...

She’s obviously upset, crying, saying she wished she didn’t get married etc...we all go to eat afterwords and things kind of settle down. We get back to the hotel and I’m like oh, what floor are you guys staying on so I can get a room. Well we get handed a set of room keys and one of the bridemades gives my wife the keys and was like...well they aren’t gonna use it. We’re pretty intoxicated mind you so we don’t initially think anything of it. 

We get in the room and realize we’re in the fucking honeymoon suite. Giant bed, jacuzzi tube, the whole thing. So we go ahead and use the amenities available to us because why not? It’ll keep in mind it’s about 4 AM at this point. we kind of realize it’s kinda weird but w/e. Well the next day the brides mom is knocking on the door expecting to see the newly weds but it’s me at the door instead...she was confused but was ok with it after I somewhat explained she wasn’t there and to talk with her and the other wedding party of the events.

We try to sneak out but we see the bride downstairs and she comes up to us and let’s us know she checked out and w/e but I could tell she was kind of annoyed...understandably so. I tell my wife to text her later on and apologize that we ended up in the room and we can pay whatever towards the room since we used it (even though it’s not like we tried to be there). So she’s just kind of short with her and basically just told us how much the room costed. 

Even though we were only in there a few hours I paid the full amount because obviously my wife’s friendship with her is worth more than some money. After that we just got a “ok thanks”.

My question is, are we the assholes for using the honeymoon suite after the groom stormed out back home? Or should we have left once we knew what it was?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bz9jrj	2019-06-11 07:42:12	skekMal	AITA For not reaching out to my birth mother who was diagnosed with cancer?	"When I was 2 years old and my brother was 3 our mother abandoned the family with no reason or explanation. We found out later she left my father for an alcoholic man with a head injury. The only time she showed back up was for an attempt to abduct us from our father who had sole custody. Even after all of this our dad still wanted us to have a chance at a relationship with our mother and would basically beg her to call us and to let us visit her. We ended up visiting her a handful of times during our childhood until she just slowly ceased all contact. Fast forward 12 years and I recieve a letter out of the blue from her filled with small talk and pictures of her dogs. I found this to be extremely weird as it totally ignored the massive elephant in the room. I wrote her back and calmly told her that before we just start talking like nothing had happened I needed at the very least an explanation for her actions during the last 20 years. That is the last interaction I have ever had with her....Have moved across the country, gotten married, and have two beautiful children now...Still no contact. I have always maintained that if she wants to be in our lives we will let her, but we are done trying to initiate.
I now recently I heard from my grandmother (mother's side) that my mother had been diagnosed with throat cancer. I feel guilty that I felt nothing..no emotion whatsoever upon hearing the news. I had a meeting with my brother and we talked about the possibility of reaching out to her or driving to the city where she lives. My brother said he would follow my lead on whatever I decide to do...I have decided to do nothing..Does this make me the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My boyfriend and I are long distance for the summer while I work out of state. 

He’s made a female friend. He has a lot of female friends, including exes, that I had no problem with, but this one instantly rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it’s insecurity with the distance, maybe it’s a gut feeling, I don’t know. I would never tell him to end a friendship over my insecurities, but I did tell him the frequency and duration of their time spent hanging out made me a little uncomfortable, and that I was working through that. 

And I hate how he’s handling it. 

1) he told her I don’t like them hanging out. For me this is like well great, that sucks, because if it is all platonic on both sides then now this normal friend thinks I have an issue with her, and if she does have interest in him, he is spending a ton of time with her and talking about trouble in his relationship, that sends off the wrong vibe IMO. 

2) they hang out a LOT. 4x a week, sometimes alone. 

3) he’s planning a trip to come see me. When I tried to make plans with him, he told me he didn’t want to plan anything. Turns out he has been planning stuff to do, only by talking it over with her. Like what? You’re coming to see me. 

I don’t know. I’ve never been a controlling girlfriend. I don’t think he’s cheating. But AITA for letting these things get to me?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

At first we spoke openly about this as we have both had some pretty shitty luck when it come to relationships however for me it was a ‘shit happens, everybody goes through it’ attitude, deal with it and move on. 

However i feel like hes still carrying it with him, as if hes a hero for getting through it.

We had a conversation were i plainly said, i think its time we put these conversations to bed as i want to move forward with you/us. 

Literally two days later we had a conversation about something which looped back to a girl he knew my ex had slept with and continued to talk about him and her and his (my exs/he cheated) gf at the time and how he hasnt changed ect ect 

WIBTA to warn him that if he doesnt stop I’ll consider ending the relationship..? I know this might sound petty but ive put that behind me and dont want to focus on the past, on an individual/personal level as well. 

Im very careful not to bring up anything about his past or exs because i dont want our relationship to be about that..

I knew that she's a puppy and prepared myself for some accidents but I really wasn't ready for the terror she was going to bring. She destroyed my blinds immediately trying to go after them when she was dropped off. She REFUSES to poop outside. She cried ALL night so I couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours and my neighbors complained about all the crying at night in the morning when I was out for four hours. And she just had diareha all over my floors. I take my dog out for a 20 minute walk every 3-4 hours when I'm home and changed it to 2 hours because this dog wouldn't go and I wanted to avoid an accident! I know for a fact my dog has never been this bad at their house and I feel like I've tried to gave her a chance but my dogs potty trained and she's never had an accident in this new house and already I have to get my carpet washed cause she pooped three times in my office and sharted all over my kitchen and living room, I need to get a new blind, and I haven't slept all night.

How am I suppose to reply to random emoj's? I can barely respond to adults with actual words! I ended up just dealing with the constant notifications until they stopped. Now I have my 8 year old niece calling and texting me because my SIL thought it would be a great idea to give an 8 year old a cellphone. I got tired of her back to back phone calls and emoj text messages that I finally replied and told her that I couldn't talk because I was at work (which wasn't a lie) and I got a text from her mother telling me how selfish and terrible of an aunt I was. I did not reply back, but I've been tempted to say that if she really wanted me to bond with my niece maybe she should start showing up to places instead of saying that she will only to end up making up an excuse as to why she couldn't make it last minute. My niece is completely innocent in this, but I don't want to be bothered through messages, especially from children who do not understand how annoying it is to have them call and message constantly for things that aren't huge. Text conversations with them end at ""what you doin"" because then all I get after that are emoj's. Am I suppose to send back a smiley emoj every time?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

She's a few years younger than me and happens to be my boss' daughter. We have NOTHING in common, we don't share the same music interests, movie interests, books, or even food preferences. I struggle to initiate conversation with her because she's not the type of person to talk in depth about things or discuss opinions or anything like that, she only seems to want to talk about memes (lame ones, we don't even like the same memes) and if she's in a creative mood, art. The thing is, we don't share the same art preferences either. I'm more of a performing arts kinda person while she's fixated on anime. Our personalities are very different as well; i'm really introverted while she is not and will often scream when talking and get over-excited about the smallest of things. I hate how she always responds with ""SAME!"" or ""MOOD!"" or ""THAT'S TOTALLY ME!"" after I say something. She also has the constant need of screaming ""I'M SO WEIRD"" every single fucking time and it irritates the hell out of me. She's always screaming and snorting and being an intrusive ass person with the tendency of inviting herself to my house or my weekend plans. She also likes to text me 24/7 and disrupt my personal life. She's one of the most cringiest people (she loves tiktok and furries) I've ever encountered in my life and the epitome of ""not like other girls""; the kind of person that I despise. She's insufferable. 

&#x200B;

However, she suffers from ADHD. She's confessed to me that she has a """"dark past"" and has been to multiple therapists and psychologists, at one point taking medication. I feel bad for her because she's obviously a very lonely person that just wants a friend. She's completely harmless, but I just can't stand the living shit out of her. I'm not the friend she needs. We don't have any chemistry and I desperately wish she would stop approaching me but at the same time, I kind of get her because I suffer from mental illness as well (however, I don't want her to know. I don't need her screaming at me ""that's so me! or some shit like that). I've told this to my family but they told me I'm just being mean. I really don't know what to think of myself."

I live 5 hours away and usually try to avoid going over when his parents are there because his mom has 6 horribly behaved little dogs and my friends 3 big dogs get very protective of her. Last week I went over cause his great dane was in heat and Ive wanted my dog to have a litter with her for a long time (I already have good homes lined up for the pups). My friend said his parents would be gone so it was a good time to come down. Well they ended up coming home by surprise and things immediately got more complicated dealing with the dogs. That night we went down the street to his cousins house and were drinking a bit. Before we left we made sure that our dogs were in good spots for the night and had food and water. I get a call around midnight from his dad saying my dog was howling and it was keeping him up. I was pretty surprised cause Ive never heard my dog howl before. Well it turns out theyd moved my dog into a room by himself even though Id asked them not to. I was a bit annoyed and tried to explain why we'd left the dogs the way we did but ended by saying Id walk over and deal with it. He responded by threatening to put my dog in the front yard. They live on a busy road and have had 2 dogs get hit by cars there. I was shocked. His wife was shocked too. I heard her gasp over the phone when he said that. I got over as fast as I could and ended up putting my dog in my car and just going to sleep. My plan was to sleep off the booze and leave early before his dad woke up. I was so mad that I honestly thought that Id hit him if I had to see him and talk to him. It didnt work out that way and I did see him in the morning. He started laying into me about how Im disrespectful and that he can put the dogs wherever he wants cause its his house. I kinda lost it and told him (as calmly as I could) that he was a sad, pathetic old man to threaten a completely innocent dog and that whatever respect I had for him was gone. I felt like I was gonna hit him if this continued so I just walked away and left. My friend agrees his dad crossed a line but thinks that I did too by insulting him. Im curious to get some other opinions. Am i the asshole here?

I should also add that my dog is the most important thing in my life. I had some of emotional issues after the military and honestly dont know that Id still be here today if it werent for that dog."		1	0
bz96lm	2019-06-11 06:54:24	ihaveanorangefatcat	AITA for cutting ties with my depressed friend	"Made this account for posting my problems because I don't want it on my main account. English is not my native language, if anything I wrote is unclear please ask.



Some background:

-I'm 25

-Our  friendship group consist of 15 people, age 23-28 (Penny is 28 now), we've been friends since high school

-The incident happens almost two years ago but recently the topic has come up again that made me rethink my original stance



The story:

Penny's been very absent from our friendship group's gathering, canceling plans, not replying to invite etc. She often say something come up or her parents won't let her go out (she lives at home), sometimes she uses money as an excuse saying she doesn't have money to go out (her parents still finance her and her family is rich)/ give no explanation at all. People are noticing and wondering what's going on with her. My friend, Em, chat Penny privately and have a serious chat with her about this. Penny said sorry, she'll try to do better but nothing changed.

A few months later, we received a note from Penny. In it she said: ""I have a goal in life that few people understand and to achieve would take a lot of sacrifice and effort. One of the sacrifice I have to make is my time with you guys. This decision doesn't just apply to this friend group but to all my friends. Sorry for being dramatic but I always knew this day would eventually come and I will hurt people, I love you and hope  to meet you all again in the right time."" At this point all of us are feeling confused/frustrated/tired about this but we just take it as if she wants to leave the friend group let her be.

However weeks after the letter she start asking do we want to go with her to this cafe etc. I started a group chat with all of us (minus Penny) to address what are we going to do about her as a group. We agree that Penny have been shitty to us, so we chose to tell Penny that she need to apologize for her past behaviors and change. When we told her this she started getting defensive saying she's depressed (her own self diagnosis, she never went to a professional) and we don't understand her problems and after back and forth between us she decided to officially leave our group (this time she leave the group chat and therefore no longer knows/invited to our group gatherings but have continued to hangout with a few of people from our group separately). Last month we have dinner party at one of my friend's house Gigi, this is a group dinner party not Gigi's. One of us apparently invited Penny and she came. While most seemingly is fine with this, me, Em and about one/two other people are not and doesn't want her invited to future gatherings.

I have been trying to educate myself on mental health and social issues in general, and now I'm thinking  if maybe back then I am being too harsh on Penny and should've been like Gigi now and reconnect? Left some details because of the limit, will clarify in comments if needed"	Asshole	0	0

I generally accept constructive criticism and really want to open communication in my relationship. I want him to be able to tell me what’s bothering him especially if somethings I can change. But I’ve been getting really annoyed with how he tells me about every little thing I did wrong. For example: I bought the wrong toilet paper, I used up all the qtips without repurchasing a box right away, I tried to recycle a pizza box, I left the bread outside of the fridge, I put PB in the fridge, I left my clothes in the dryer before I went to school etc.  It’s just such little things that he could fix by himself. He himself is not perfect and I’ve definitely fixed things little things that are his mistakes without saying anything which I feel is fairly normal. Like I’ve lived with roommates, and siblings and of course my parents before but we’ve never told the other person little errors like forgetting to replace the toilet paper roll or using up all the milk? Sure it’s annoying to deal with but it’s human error. People forget and or they’re in a rush. I’m personally getting really annoyed and honestly even guilty when he points out my errors and mistakes. I know that I’m in the wrong because well, they’re my mistakes but I’m wondering if I would be TA by telling him to just fix the small issues himself and to just not tell me because I do the same for him?		1	0

bz932q	2019-06-11 06:41:43	snortlines69	AITA for not living with my mom after what she did?	"So last year on December 11th I found out that my mom had ran out on me and my dad. The way she did it though wasn't correct, in my opinion. She had rented a house that was a city over and while my dad was at a doctors appointment (more on that in a bit) she had came home, packed her clothes and anything valuable, and left. Then, to put the icing on the cake, she got my older sister (who always swayed her way) to move in with her. This totally fucked my sisters future because she had just gotten off probation and was on the track to college if she had been in our house with my dad for another week. Shes extremely smart and it pains me to see her fail. So, our Christmas got fucked right into oblivion. Spirit was crushed. Then my mom sets up dates for me to go over there. I didnt want to see her on Christmas, so the day after I went. I was livid with her, exploding on her and telling her how bad she fucked up. I stormed out of her house and had my dad pick me up as I couldn't be in there much longer. By now, she got the court shit set up and my dad had his lawyer and vice versa. My mom had the court set up for me to go there every other week. I said no and tried everything I could to not go there but nothing worked. I'm solid on what I stand for, but I had to go because my dad made me just to please her. Now it's probably a good time to say that my dad has had lyme disease multiple times and is now suffering from crazy bad fibromyalgia (arthritis but for muscles is how I'd put it) so she left right before it hit the fan, and she knew it would. She always said she didnt want to take care of him if he got sick, but I mean dont make wedding vows if you cant keep them am I right? So me and my dad are dirt poor, but at least we keep the house because she left and all this shit. I always tell her I dont like living with her because my friends, family, school, sports and everything is here. She crys, but I dont care for it because she shouldn't have done this. Me and my dad have suspected her of cheating because I found a way into her phone records and found how long shes called numbers for, searched one up and it was a guy she worked with. Went to the gym the week before I did this, called him 1 minute at 9, and came home at 12. Multiple calls to his number in the past. Now, I despise my mom but I dont hate her. I dont love her enough to say it. So I've said to the court that I'd like to be in full custody of my dad, showing my mom a little respect and saying I'll visit. I'm not going to change my view on this, and I dont feel sorry for my mom. I do for my sister. My dad is going to keep me out of trouble, keep me smart in school, working all the time, and wants me to be the greatest person ever because he was horrible in his younger days with stuff like drugs and thievery. That is why I choose to live with him. 
So, AITA for not wanting to live with my mom? Is this too harsh on my mom or does she deserve it?

I told her that I applied for a waitress job ( a couple actually) and she sucked in her breath through bared teeth and went ""yeah, about that. I worked in waitressing for 10 years, I know you couldn't handle it. It'd be too difficult for you"". 

I felt really bummed after that. She always builds me up with positivity about how amazingly talented I am (she's a motivational speaker now actually) how capable and smart I am..and then hits me with statements that really make me feel down. Like someone complementing me on how youthful I look, and her response to me being ""yeah, but only cause you never really 'lived'. Everyone else has ( done pot, drank, smoke, drugs, had a baby, etc) There's no life experience in your face"".

My question is, is she being an asshole, or constructive ? It is really hard to make heads or tails with her statements sometimes. Like I said, she is a motivational speaker now. Also a marriage counselor, Yoga instructor, animal rights activist, she works in a nursing home as well and houses neglected/abused foster kids to teach them healthy family values and self worth. She's about as practical and mature as anyone I have ever met....which makes me feel like she was right. Cause she is always right."		1	0

"This whole situation has some backstory so here goes, At the beginning of the year me and 3 friends decided to make a game to enter in some competitions and stuff, which is something I'd done for the past 4 years. However my workload this year is much larger than previous years, and larger than I expected. Some context going forward, I am a serial procrastinator, I get most stuff done days before it's due, and I also have heavy anxiety.

&#x200B;

I procrastinated for ages on this game and now not much of it is done, with the first competition deadline being in 5 weeks. Two of my teammates begin getting understandably pissed because there wasn't much progress done on the game, and pressuring me to step it up and make more progress. Now at this point a lot of the other work that I need to have done is coming up due, including my major work which makes up a large part of my result for the end of high school, and, that I have of course been procrastinating on.

&#x200B;

So at this point, I have a barely worked on game, a major work and a huge amount of stress and anxiety that is making me physically sick. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr I procrastinated on a group project throughout most of the year and it's coming up due at the same time as one of my final exams/projects for high school and it's making me sick with anxiety and stress.

bz8xlw	2019-06-11 06:22:24	oranumbra	AITA for hating another cast member in my musical	"Hey reddit, just a quick thing I have been thinking about...  


I am currently in a musical at my local college as an ensemble member. It's not a big production or anything of the sort, we just put on a few shows in the local area, that are quite good quality in my (obviously biased) opinion. Now onto the real meat of the post. The cast member in question is one of the lead male roles. Nick (not his real name), myself and a few other people had made it to callbacks, it being my first callback ever, so I was pretty excited. Unfortunately, I didn't get the role and instead it went to Nick, who is new to the society. A bit disappointing obviously, but I was happy I got into the musical at all. At least that was what I thought at the time.

Come rehearsals and he is...bad. We're about 15 rehearsals in now and he still struggles with the first few songs that we learnt. He can't read sheet music (something quite important for learning musicals) and sings out of tune. I can't help but think that I would be a better fit for the role. Not only that, but he messes around and doesn't pay attention when our vocal coach is teaching him the songs and choreography. We are a pretty relaxed society, but we pay attention when there are things to learn. There's a time to hang out and a time to learn. 

I find myself really disliking Nick. I'm usually a quiet guy, and it took me a while to come out of my shell in the society, where I have made plenty of friends over the past year. He's just so loud, obnoxious and annoying. Am I an asshole for despising him? Of course I don't let him know it, I am cordial and friendly on the outside (you need to be a good actor for musicals), but I still feel somewhat bad for just how much I dislike him, and how much I think I would be a better fit for the character.

Basically i'm on a trip with my family and yesterday we checked into a hotel, and we brought snacks. This morning i ate one, and obviously i wanted to throw it into the trash bin. But i didn't know where it was since we only just checked in yesterday night and all i had in my mind was to sleep. So i simply ask my mom, ""Hey mom, where's the trash bin?"" and i can assure you, i didn't raise my voice, didn't say it in an asshole-ish tone, i just simply asked that. My mom replies by yelling at me and complaining about how can i live alone if i don't know how to find a trash bin (of course i can find it, i just decided to ask her). She basically spent a full 30s lecturing me about how i have to find trash bins by myself

bz8tqi	2019-06-11 06:08:50		WIBTA for having expectations from my boyfriend?	"Hey, so I am F(20) in college right now so money is always been a bit tight, with high rent prices and coming from a lower middle class family. I have always struggled with money. 

Currently I do not have a job as I have been applying for jobs recently. 

Anyways here where the story begins. My boyfriend of almost a year has always been really stingy with money, even though he comes from a upper class background. I usually don’t bother to count the couple of dollars or cents he owes me for certain things because as much as it matters it also doesn’t. He doesn’t purchase extravagant dinners and gets me to purchase them for him, but he does get food here and there and sometimes I’ll pay for him as it is much more convenient, or easier in the moment. 

Recently money has been much more right due to family dying and my dad having to travel so much for their funerals, so I don’t have that extra stretch room that I had before. 

Anyways today my boyfriend refused to help pay for some groceries I needed. It was under 20$ and left me hanging. I really needed him to support me and I know 20$ isn’t a lot too him but the fact that he left me high and dry for a bit really upset me. Since anytime he has needed money I have always lent him 15$, 20$ here and there bought him food ect. It seems like he doesn’t genuinely care as I would’ve transferred him the money eventually once I got the money. 

Next he left me at the convenience store at 1:30 am alone, and left because he couldn’t wait 5 minutes for my pizza to get made. It was a Friday night so there were a lot of drunk people and I generally expressed how unsafe I felt walking home alone but he seemed to have little regard for my feelings. 

It just seems like I’m doing for him much more then what he would do for me. So here’s the question. Would I be the asshole if I broke up with him over these reasons or is this too petty?"		1	0
bz8tfz	2019-06-11 06:07:49	sassyT44	"AITA for telling my sister to ""shut the hell up""?"	"Today me and my sister planned to meet up with 3 of our childhood friends who came back home recently. It's been over 10 years since we've seen them so it was kind of special. We decided to meet at a local restaurant for lunch and drinks. When we all sat down things were amazing. We started to try to catch up with each other before the problem hit.

&#x200B;

Let me tell you about my sister. I love her to death but she **dominates** conversations. Every conversation with her turns to be about herself and her views and she never gives anyone else a chance to talk. She doesn't do this maliciously but no mater how much I've talked to her about this is never stops. 

&#x200B;

So when we all started chatting the conversation quickly became about her. She immediately started talking about herself and everything she had done and pretty much let no one else take the spotlight. Even when me and someone else at the table began talking on our own she barged in and pulled us back. When ever anyone else talked she immediately made it about herself. I tried to drop hints that maybe she should calm down but she either ignored or didn't see them. One of our friends even said ""Well sister, that's pretty exciting and all but maybe someone else has something more exciting to say"" but she just kept talking. 

&#x200B;

This went on for 30 minutes before she got up and went to the bathroom. The atmosphere was already super awkward when someone said ""does she ever shut the fuck up about herself?"" I apologized and immediately got up and went and waited by the bathroom for her. When she came out I tried to be nice and tall her to ease off but she started to argue with me. For about 3 minutes she pretty much said that I was being rude and that she was not being a ""attention hog"". This went back and forth and I just kinda snapped and told her she needs to ""shut the hell up about herself because she is being extremely rude to our friends."". I didn't shout this but nearby tables heard us and began to stare. She immediatly told me I had ruined this for her and left the restaurant. When I went back to the table and told the others what happened they said I was harsh but fair.

&#x200B;

Now my sister is raising hell over this. Her and my mom think I went way overboard and that I should have not confronted her and just asked nicely at the table. My dad and friends all say I did nothing wrong and she's an adult and needs to learn this stuff. 

&#x200B;

I really did try to be nice when I told her and keep it quite but she just escalated it until i kinda snapped and I did apologize but now she wants one for calling her an ""attention hog"". AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bz8sti	2019-06-11 06:05:40		AITA for ghosting my family?	"So, I came out as gay at the age of 15. I got a lukewarm response from my parents, and a slightly disapproving one from my brother. My parents essentially said they will always love me, wanted me to downplay my sexuality so that it didn't become a big deal, and my brother was frustrated with me and didn't want to be around me after I first told him. In the following months after I came out to him he was distance and I felt like he felt I was embarrassing him. 

Fast forward now and I'm 22 and recently graduated college. Things with my family since then are mostly civil and normal, but we don't really talk about my sexuality or dating life, like its not acknowledged. Things between my brother are sort of awkward and tense, but we operate okayish. Until a few nights ago.

Basically, the conversation of pride came up where my parents and brother didn't understand what the point was, and I tried defending it. MY parents listened calmly, but my brother got flustered and left. Later, when I tried to talk to him, he accused me of attention seeking and saying that he doesn't understand why I shove my sexuality down his throat.

I didn't really have a response to that, but I was angry with him. So I left. My Parents asked what had happened and I told them. They said ""well you know how sensitive [brother, 19 M] is and maybe this just isn't something you should talk about when you spend time together"" but at that point I had enough and said that they were just excusing his behavior.

I went to my room and no one came to bother me. While they were asleep, I packed my things and drove to the next state over to stay with my Grandma (it was 8 a.m. when I got there and she was happy to see me). I explained the situation and asked if I could stay with her and she said yes. This was a couple days ago.

The day of leaving my family texted me but I didn't respond. Today they called but I refused to talk to them. My Grandma is upset because she says that I need to work things out with my family but honestly I don't really think I want them in my life anymore. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bz8sj9	2019-06-11 06:04:30	camcrazy00	AITA for dating my friend's ex	"So, little back story here. My friend dated this girl We'll call N.

My friend and N dated for a little over 2 months before breaking up. My friend could tell I had a crush on her but never made a move on it, as they were dating. So my friend says after breaking up with her that I could date her. Fast forward 5 months and here we are.

So me and N have now been dating for 3 and a half months now and things are going good till my friend and his friend (G) are now calling out me out in front of N. My friend and G are saying stuff like ""Ur breaking the bro code man, its not cool to date friend's ex's"" and so I bring up the fact that he gave me permission. My friend's saying im lying, G thinks im lying. And worst of all N starts thinking im lying and breaks up with me. Because of this over time im slowly just thinking that im in the wrong, I shouldn't have even dated his ex, etc.

I know this might be an obvious, YTA, NTA, ESH, Etc. But this is really eating me up inside and I need to know if im in the wrong.

This isn’t going to be as juicy as most of the other stories on here and I apologize in advance for how petty this will be. I’m really just looking for other people’s insights and maybe a little bit of advice because I hate feeling this way.
  Not too long ago me and my significant other were having a conversation about our exes. Very stupid I know. We’ve been together for a very long time  and my ex came up in conversation over lunch so on the drive home I asked him about his ex. As the conversation flowed he mentioned that his ex is crazy but she is also hot- just not hot enough to justify her crazy. And that when we fight I could not compare to the level of crazy she would reach. Sarcastically I replied oh is hotter than me too then? (Very stupid I know) he replied she’s hot but that I am more cute, and that he likes cute more anyways. 
After this I admittedly caught an attitude and the argument began and escalated. To him cute and hot are exchangeable but to me that just feels like him backtracking because why would he distinguish it in the first place then? I’m not going to drag this on with the rest of the argument details but he basically asked what could he do to make it better and I said he never said sorry for hurting my feelings to which he finally said sorry. 
It has still been bugging me and he just says that he’s attracted to me, I’m being insecure, and i need to move on. Before you ask we are all adults he is late 20s and I am mid 20s lol
Anyone have any ideas? If I wasn’t insecure would I be confident in my hotness and not be mad? 
Also I do want to put a disclaimer- I don’t actually know that his ex is crazy and I feel bad saying to a bunch of strangers. I’ve never met her so I don’t know for sure what she looks like or her mental state. I do know she has had a lot of plastic surgery and that my ex says she’s like every 15 y/0 dreams.(Blonde & big boobs). I have heard I am attractive but who can gauge that.
TLDR; boyfriend and I are having a petty fight because he called his ex hot and me cute."		1	0

bz8mz1	2019-06-11 05:45:25		AITA for taking $20 off the ground	"This happened a few years ago and i just remembered it and still wonder whos the asshole. 

I know this sounds of an obvious NTA, but when it happened, our friends were really divided. 

When I was younger, I used to walk to school everyday. There was two different routes, one path was closer to my house and the other was longer and  had a hill, but choosing it meant I could walk with my friend to school. I didn’t often chose the route with my friend because it was too much work with the distance and inclinations. 

One day I went the long route to meet up with my friend, Gina. Gina had been waiting for me and we began to walk on the dirt path. We chatting and having fun, but then I saw a $20 bill and I snatched it up. Gina was day dreaming wnd didnt notice the bill until it was in my hand.  She instantly that she should have it because she always walked this route and she deserved it. I said an obvious no that I noticed it first, picked it up first while she didn’t even realize it.  She then asked to split, again said no. She was instantly upset with me and said she wouldve found it before me, that she was gonna leave earlier and that I prevented her from finding it first. 

She told all of our friends,  they all became mad at em saying YTA and said I should split. I told them what really happened and some of them agreeded with me. 

Her argument was: 1. I dont normally walk that route and she wouldve found it first, 2. I didn’t give her a chance to see it since i was ninja fast, 3. We were walking together and should’ve split it out of the kindness of my own heart. 


TLDR: was running late to a walking route I didn’t normall take because I wanted to walj with friend. Found $20 while my friend was distracted and refused to split it. Friend got mad because I didn’t take that path and she could’ve got the $20 if she didn’t wait for me."	Not the A-hole	1	0

bz8lug	2019-06-11 05:41:39	0ForTheHorde	AITA for refusing to feel my pregnant wife's belly kicks?	"My wife is five months pregnant with our first child. Recently, she has felt some small kicks from the baby. I tried to feel for a few nights, but no kicking. Then on Saturday, my best friend was over playing games with the two of us. We started talking baby stuff, and my wife mentioned that the baby has started kicking. My friend, who was very happy and excited, asked if he could feel her belly, and she said, ""No, but I appreciate you asking."" My friend was visibly upset/discouraged, but we moved on. My friend slept over after having a few drinks, but after he left the next morning, my wife and I talked about it and I told her that I was upset that she didn't let my friend feel her belly. She said that it was her body and she didn't want anyone but her mom or me touching her belly. So I told her that I will not be touching her belly and that that was my choice and I thought she was being unfair to not let my friend (30 and single) experience that life growing inside of her. She cried a lot and we talked a lot more, but it just seems selfish to me. Am I the asshole here?
TLDR: Wife didn't let my friend feel her pregnant belly, so I decided that I would not be feeling her pregnant belly.

Update : Looks like I am an asshole. I'm at work and texted her that I'm excited to feel our baby and that I'm sorry for being an asshole.

Update 2: While I completely do understand that I was being immature and petty, many people are calling my friend a perv. I think it's a very normal desire to want to feel a baby kick in the womb? Also, all clothes were on. At no point did he ask to feel her bare belly. 
I now understand that I have no say in who is allowed to touch her belly and who is not allowed.

Update 3: Not sure if it is at all relevant, but my wife went back home for the week (before any of this happened) and my sister was the first person to feel baby's kicks, after my wife invited her to feel. My wife and I hadn't had the conversation of who is allowed to feel and who is not allowed to feel, so I figured if my sister was allowed, then our friend would be allowed. I shouldn't have assumed, but that was my line of thinking.

Update 4: just got home from work, got her a big bouquet of flowers and sat down and hugged her and tried to feel baby. We talked about it and I texted her the link to the post. I told her I was stupid and that I fucked up big time and that I was very sorry. She accepted my apology and she's getting ready for work while I make her breakfast.

Final update : I did hear you all loud and clear. Fuck me, yes I'm the asshole here. To be honest, I was very excited that our friend was excited for us. I was then just discouraged that it seemed like he was being stifled. But my wife felt uncomfortable. That's that. End of story. I should've been fully supportive of her wishes in this situation and I wasn't. We're 4 years into a very young relationship (I'm 22, she's 21). I know that I have a ton of growing to do and I get that I fucked up here. I'm trying my best and sometimes my best sucks ass. I'm trying to be excited for this baby (I'm mainly terrified), and I fucked up. Thank you for showing me what needed to change."	Asshole	0	0

bz8jxx	2019-06-11 05:35:11	CAPTAIN_COCKSLAP	AITA for demanding my mother sell her house?	"32/M. I'm working a good job, paid well, but I'm not rich; just saving a little every paycheck. My mother (60) is a former contractor in oil and gas office work - used to clear ~180-250k a year, on the basis of her experience and a community college associate's degree.

Me: Lived at home until 23 with my dad (my parents divorced when I was 11), moved out with help from both of them after. University student and working part-time until '09 when I graduated and couldn't find work... promptly took a fast-track second degree with $40k in loans and was working steadily by 2015.

The market crash that screwed me in 2009 didn't hit my mother's sector until about 2012. She hasn't had a job since 2013 paying what she was used to; she took out a home equity loan of about $130k, ostensibly to renovate her house for sale, but spent it all. She lives alone(albeit with a cat) in a 3-bedroom bungalow on 2 acres of land.

She's gotten occasional clerical/service work in the meantime, but barely paying her bills and not servicing the debt at all, or maintaining the house. I've loaned her $6k (most to pay property taxes) and lent her my car for the past year(paying insurance and maintenance) because her BMW and Jaguar broke down from no maintenance work.

Now she's unemployed again, still driving my car, and her $3k in yearly property taxes are due. I asked her what she planned to do, and her response was, ""Well, *I* can't pay it!""

I told her that the house should be on the market by the end of the week, or I'm taking my car back and she's on her own. This isn't the first serious conversation I've had with her, and she seems quite offended that I won't just pay for her $600k house forever while I'm renting my own apartment.

My father, by comparison, is in the same boat (pushing 60, no savings, no retirement plan), but hasn't asked for anything but occasional gas money. He's working steadily and has no serious debt.

As for me: I've paid off my student loans due to hard work (i.e., full-time night shifts for a year) and want to look at moving away from this city. I'm not rich by any means, but I don't worry about my own bills and save about 10% a month. I just am absolutely unwilling to continue paying for a house I don't own and don't live in.

AITA for demanding my mother sell her $600k house to pay off her debts(and hopefully pay me back)? She'd have enough money from the sale to rent a decent place and live well(if frugally) for the rest of her life... there are significant pension benefits coming her way in a few years."

Basically when me and my girlfriend go out late at night I usually will not drive and we take Uber’s. I pay 90% of the time, but my girlfriend was expressing how she would rather not go out unless I’m driving, as it’s easier for her money wise (she pays maybe a $25 trip every 3 weeks, while I pay for all of them whenever we go out multiple times a week). 

The reason behind me not wanting to drive is that I got a new car that I literally love and have had really bad experiences at night in the city I live in. Like we usually go downtown and the traffic is always so fucking bad and it kinda stresses me out less to just call Uber’s. 

She has a car, but no licence, as she has failed 3 times and always says if she has her licence, which she is attempting again in 1 month that she doesn’t care and will always drive at night. 


I’ve been involved in 3 accidents (not faulted on any) all of which while driving downtown at night and while I have no problem driving there if necessary I’d just much rather Uber to have the peace of mind and be able to drink and enjoy myself freely. I usually grab a couple beers when we go out, or can smoke and won’t be able to do that when I drive as well.

I have always been the responsible one out of my siblings. I am also the youngest. I have my own apartment that I share with my boyfriend. It is a small one bedroom with not a lot of extra space. My sister has been staying with our cousin who just sucks as a person. She finally couldn’t take staying with her anymore and messaged me asking if she could stay with me for a bit. I responded to her saying no for the following reasons. 

1. I honestly do not have the room. 
2. To get in and out of my building you need a key card, I could not get her an extra. She would not have easy access coming and going. 
3. She has a dog, I have a dog. My dog doesn’t like other dogs. He’s a good sweet boy but gets easily jealous. Also my apartment requires a $500 pet deposit fee, even for visiting pets. We found that out the hard way when watching my boyfriends moms cat. 
4. It’s parking by permit only and the little amount of street parking there is is on an unsafe side street where cars are constantly getting broken in too. 

I made sure to be very kind in my response and explain my reasons why. 
My sister actually understood. My mom on the other hand completely flipped out on me. Saying I was only saying no because I was unwilling. I was a selfish person who didn’t care that her sister was going to be homeless (she isn’t going to be). She said my reasons for saying no weren’t valid and I am just being an asshole.

"I am Managing Director at a small company with 12 employees company (4 managers). We do a round table of all departments at a Monday morning meeting. One manager (59 years old, I'm 34) answers every question as an elaborate story with a Beginning, Middle and Conclusion. I can see other people lose interest halfway through. Questions that could be answered with one sentence takes 3 to 4 minutes to answer essentially saying the same thing.

Example 1:

**Me after a sales meeting:** ""You met with company X, Will company X buy from us?""

**Sales Manager :** "" I drove to the Bethlehem on Monday, it was really cold on Monday and there is an awesome little bakery on the way there. I got some pancakes <more bakery info> I met with the MD, interestingly his brother Craig actually moved to Australia a few years ago and ruins a successful business there selling baby clothes. <more info about a random in Aus> eventually... Company X said that they actually specialize in motor spares, they offered to keep our product on consignment.

**Answer I expected:** I met with Peter the MD of X, they said they are not interested in laying out working capital to sell our product because they specialize in automotive parts. I think we should stop persuing this lead/ We should change our product offering in the following ways...

By the time we reach the conclusion I am irritated, the rest of the team isn't listening. I some times interrupt him with a conclusion to just summarize what he is trying to say and get on with the meeting. The manager gets upset when he gets interrupted (now by most of the staff). I have told him to try and summarize his thoughts and lead with the outcome/conclusion and then elaborate if people have questions. I tried to explain business communication is different to telling a story a a BBQ. He is s great jokes/story teller socially, but in the work place it is too much IMO.

Am I the asshole for interrupting / cutting short a manager who tells super long stories, to say something that can easily be said in 1 sentence.

Edit. I'm Managing Director (MD) and leading the team."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bz8c8x	2019-06-11 05:09:52		AITA? My friend is ignoring me because I was too emotianally needy	"I had a friend who we will call Angie. She is not a bad person and almost always helped me through my emotional breakdowns and was kind to me in general. I started depending on her. I told her that if I was ever being too clingy, she can tell me off.

Angie has a friend group of 4 people, one of them  being a friend we'll call Tina. She was also really kind to me and sometimes stayed awake to make sure I go to sleep.

There was a situation where I really needed some reassurance from Angie. I had a psychologist appointment scheduled the next day. She ignored me and left the room. Later I wrote her a text that I'd rather her to tell me straight that she doesn't want to talk and that I'm hurt. She called me an emotional manipulator, and that I am sucking all energy out of her and that she's not willing to ruin her mental health because of me. An argument started, but it ended quickly and we apologized.

The next day she's not talking to me. Her whole friend group isn't talking to me. Later I heard that she was talking about our argument to someone in her class. 

On the second day Angie accidentally walked into a room I was alone in. She asked me if I was mad or if she did something wrong. I answered no to both of them. Then she told me that she's not talking about her personal stuff with anyone. Tina was now standing behind her. I told her ""Why are you talking about it now in front of-"" I didn't even finish my sentence and Tina was already screaming at me. Angie then screamed at her to fuck off and then both of them left, with Tina slamming the door. After the shock passed I decided that I need to go for a walk. I saw Angie crying on the stairs. I gave her tissues and asked her to come with me. She refused and I respected that. I told her that when I return, we can talk. She agreed.

When I returned, she was already laughing with her friends so I left her alone. I just wrote her a text asking if she will come. She didn't reply.
Next day I wrote her another text, wishing her good luck on her exams and if she's willing to talk this out, I'm here. I even said that we don't have to be friends at all.

A week later, she's still not talking to me. Tina is flat out ignoring me. AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

Right now I get told I look anywhere between 10 and 16, and despite constantly being told how happy that should make me, most adults do not want to look and be treated like children. I constantly get rude comments about it from people when they find out my real age. Things like wow you look like a child, I thought you were a little girl etc. 

I was recently standing in the security line at the airport and a man behind me starting hollering that I didn't look old enough to have the drivers license I was holding. 

I used to try to take it well and smile and laugh,  but I'm honestly so tired of it.  Now my husband gets mad at me when I glare at these people or show that I'm annoyed.  Why are these comments socially acceptable, and why do I need to be gracious in response to them?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I just graduated college and moved back into my parents' house, since they offered. I understand that when moving back in with your parents, there are going to be strings attached. 

Ever since I got my license at 16yo, I've been having to drive my little brother & sister everywhere. My mom owns a business and my dad works 2 jobs, so I understand how difficult it is for them to get their kids where they need to be. Fast forward - like I said, I'm now 21, about to be 22 and now that I've moved in, it's happening again.

I'm trying not to be the bitchy child. I will unload the dishwasher, I'll vacuum, I'll help out around the house. The one thing that grinds my gears is having to drive my brother everywhere. And yes, my parents do pay for my car & have made payments on it - but hear me out. I did not birth these kids. When my parents were having kids, they had to have seen this coming. 

Being a parent is hard, and I get that. I just think that since I'm an adult and I am working M-F (I work from home), I think that I should be able to do what I want. When I have kids of my own, I'll have to drive them around. I'll be perfectly okay with that because I CHOSE to have kids and know what comes with them.

Exhibit A - I was working today & my brother comes up and asks, ""Can you drive me to my friend's house in Indiana?"" WE LIVE IN IL. I had to drive my brother an hour to his friend's house and come back home - two hours of my time eaten up. My mom's excuse was, ""I have to work."" I was in the middle of working as well. My dad had just come back from work and watched me walk out the door to drive my brother. Didn't offer to drive him himself, just watched me walk out the door. 

Reddit, I need your opinion because this has been eating me up for a long time. I have had to cancel my own plans and drop everything to drive my siblings to different places. AITA?

EDIT: Forgot to mention that my sister is 16yo and has a car (that my parents pay for) and her license and she is also living in the house and can drive my brother places as well & never does."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bz8aoj	2019-06-11 05:04:36	biancamattel	AITA for getting mad at my friend for giving the artist who causes us to become friends in the first place a gift meant only for my friend?	"*caused. 

Longtime lurker, finally felt like I had something to post. A few years ago, I met my friend K on social media. We got very close, + talk everyday even tho we live a few states away. We met bc we were both part of a community dedicated to a certain band that was VERY popular ab a decade ago but had since broke up (think headlining major festivals, sold out arena tours) and especially one of the members, P, who is still musically active + fronts a solo project that is obviously smaller (600-1000 person venues) but is still very popular w very dedicated fans + world tours. We have both seen P (his solo project, not the original big band) in concert multiple times + even met him. In fact, the first time K and I met in person was at a hometown P concert in my state. K flew up from his state to see it. 

P + his music has always been very relevant with K and I bc we met bc of our love for P. P is from the state that I live in currently + that K was born in (K now lives in a different state). P often references this state + takes pride in being from here (the original popular band did too as they are also from here). K adores my state - he visits often, has family here, + roots for the sports teams from here. K also takes pride in being born here. For K’s bday, I wanted to get him a small gift relating to my state (think I <3 NY type gifts), so I got him some stickers and pins, one of the pins having an outline of my state with the word « local » on it. Getting it to him required a lot of effort, as I was originally going to give the gift + a letter to him on person (I was going to see him in person on his bday when he came to my state but the plans fell through) but decided to mail it to his friend instead, who would give it to K (this was easier than directly mailing to to K). By the time I got it together, mailed it to his friend, she received it, + she gave it to him, it had been almost two months since his bday. However, he loved the gift, used the stickers and pins, + thanked me.

A few weeks after receiving the gift, K goes to see P in concert in his state. After the show, K is able to meet P and gives him the local pin that I sent K because P is from +loves my state. When I got mad at K for this, as I paid for + went through a lot of effort to send the pin to him, K snapped back by saying he (K) wasn’t a “local” anyway bc he moved away when he was young, + that I shouldn’t get mad bc the whole reason we met was in a community about P. Now we are both mad at each other. I know that it’s technically K’s possession now so he can do what he wants with it + it’s very cool how that went in full circle but it was meant for K only - it took a lot of effort to get to him and was special.

There was an employee cleaning the self-checkout next to me so I asked him; “I’m sorry to bother you, would you mind helping me with this?” I showed him the sticker and he muttered a yeah.
He put his stuff down and started punching the codes in. I said “thank you” and he responded with “Oh it’s no problem, no need to thank me. Its my job, I do this alllll day.” I gave a general “great attitude, thank you again” response. Word for word, he repeats the same answer as before. I didn’t answer him because I already had the first time. 
Once he was done, he looks at me, bows and nods towards the self-checkout machine and says “For you M’Lady”. I giggle-snorted loudly and he turned bright red and walked away from the self-checkouts rather quickly, abandoning his post.

bz89n7	2019-06-11 05:01:49	FinA123	AITA for wanting to remove my foreskin?	"A little bit of background:

I am a 50ish married man living in the US. I grew up in a pretty rural area, and my parents never considered removing my foreskin when I was a child. In fact, I didn't even know about circumcision until I was a teenager. It never bothered me much, but as I got older, i started to feel self conscious. Within the last few years, I've been hanging out with a group of coworkers who have become close friends of mine. They pretty regularly make jokes about my foreskin, which I don't really mind but feel pretty embarrassed about. Their pretty regular discussion of the topic, along with several other smaller factors, has gotten me thinking about making a change.

Onto the wife: she is fairly against the idea of circumsicion. I have told her it is my own body and I ultimately make the decision, but she gets angry each time I broach the subject and refuses to talk to me for the rest of the day. She believes that is far too late for me to get circumcised and tbat i have no ""good"" reason to have it done. Additionally, she believes that I will hurt myself while performing the procedure.

Am I the asshole for considering this? Please let me know, I would love to get another perspective on this."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Here’s some backstory - my girlfriend went out the other night with a friend which she usually does every weekend which is totally fine. While she was talking about her night she told me that instead of ubering home these random guys offered to drive her and her friend home. All went ok thankfully but when she told me this I immediately freaked out for obvious reasons. First of all she does not know the guys. Second of all who knows what their intentions could have been? She is probably going to tell me that they weren’t hitting on them (as I think they went to a gay bar) but this is still no excuse as anyone could be lying. Most importantly out of all of this which concerned me the most is that they were probably drinking and the driver could have been intoxicated.

bz88d5	2019-06-11 04:57:45	Blackmarketplums	WIBTA for using my “friends” PlayStation plus account	So about a month ago I decided to make a Minecraft world with some of my friends for nostalgic reasons, but in order to play online Minecraft you need a ps plus account. This costs around like $20 or something for a few months and I didn’t feel like paying for it. I decided to use my then friends account that had the ps plus on it. Fast forward a few weeks and my friend (Blake) had hit the last straw. He became really annoying and screwed over multiple of my friends. Everyone pretty much stopped hanging out with him. I still played Minecraft with him and so did another friend of mine even though we were not close with Blake and never hung out anymore (he played on another account that he had which is already kinda me being an asshole but that’s because I was on his and it was no big deal for him just to be on this other one). Now our Minecraft world is actually quite big and we put a lot of work into it. We no longer want to start a new one because of everything we would lose. Blake also owns a pc too, and unless playing with us will never go on his ps4. So am I the asshole for using his account for his ps plus even though he got kicked out of our friend group. Note: I cannot switch or copy the world to my account if I wanted to. This is also my first post so sorry for it being confusing.	Asshole	0	0
bz88bi	2019-06-11 04:57:36		AITA for calling my mom pathetic after seeing her hit my dad.	"So my(21) dad(59) and mom(57) have been having issues recently. My mom found out recently that many guys watch porn, and with that she found out my dad does. I want to note my parents have been amazing, loving, supportive parents. Sometimes they're strict and we disagree but overall amazing parents. Both of them. 

My dad lied in the past that he doesnt watch it and that really hurt my mom as she felt she was being cheated on in a way. Porn also very strongly goes against our religion so it was hypocritical for him to preach the religion so strongly but do this in the background. My dad has been very regretful and apologetic and clearly he feels terrible about it (it's the only time I've seen him cry besides deaths). He also seems proactive is trying to stop as they installed programs that block adult content on his computer and phone. 

Last year when my mom found out about the porn, she hit him many times. She often leaves scratches on his face and neck and sometimes he bleeds a little. Everytime shes hitting him he is fully defensive and never retaliates. When I sat them down and we talked about what was going on, I said how I didnt like how she hit my father. Instead of taking ownership or being apologetic she gave me the reasons she did it and pointed to problems in her childhood that make her act this way etc. My father told me not to get mad at her as he deserves getting hit for what he did. I took it on the chin and realized I dont know everything that is going on so I let it go.

This was yesterday. After sleeping on it and spending all day today thinking about it, I realized how much I disliked that she deflected responsibility and how terrible it looked (the picture of me seeing my dad bent over in the corner and her hitting him very aggressively.) And after seeing how quickly he took responsibility for mistakes and how bad he felt vs how my mom pointed blame, and realizing this wasnt 1 instance of abuse. She has been hitting him for who knows how long ON TOP of the fact she knows he was beaten as a child, I got so angry. 

When I saw her tonight I was cold at first and she asked if I was mad (I'm usually very not confrontational and I dont talk much). I answered yes. When she asked why I said I dont like that she hit my dad and even more so how she acted when I called her out. I said I think it's absolutely terrible she did it and pathetic. She said a couple words (I forget what) and I cut her off saying how she was the one who taught me abuse is bad and she is the one doing it. And how terrible of a sight it was seeing my dad hurled in the room. My dad tried to defend her and I cut him off saying hes not gonna convince me. Her actions were pathetic and hypocritical and I didnt wanna hear anything from him rn. It was very quiet as we awkwardly watched the basketball game and then she went upstairs for the night. I felt good I spoke my mind, but I feel bad as I know she is going through a tough time.

I recently got married, and for the past 11 months I've been working a demanding job (60-70 hours a week) and preparing for the marriage and our life together and things of that sort. I'm 21 and before the events of the past year, I spent a lot of time with my friends, if we weren't hanging out in person you could bet money we were hanging out playing video games together. Honestly, we never went more than a few hours from hearing from one another, in my group of 7 guys that I've known for six or seven years. Over the past year, my friends, specifically two of them have become fairly annoyed at my lack of presence and communication. I've explained to them that I'm working 12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week and that I had a fiancee now a wife to give my time too as well. They just were not a priority anymore. Now that I've gotten married it's gotten even worse from those two friends, and it's really starting to make me feel like an ass. If I get off Xbox or something like that before 11:30 to go lay in bed with my wife I'm met with groans of disappointment and complaints. I don't let them stop me, my wife will ALWAYS take prioirty, but they're annyoing and they're weighing on my mind. So, reddit, AITA?		1	0
bz8739	2019-06-11 04:53:42	orangefish97	AITA for yelling at my parents.	"I M21 and my parents got into a pretty heated argument about how cluttered our house is. I recently graduated from college and am home until October when I start a job away from come.

I think my parents are hoarders. Not crazy ones like you see on extreme hoarding TV shows, but It’s a bit over the top. They feel the need to keep 50% of the butter dishs, Cool Whip containers, orange juice bottles ect. And refuse to throw them away. We have so many old clothes at our house that we are never going to wear again, there’s so many old newspapers Laying around that my mom will keep for any reason imaginable, amongst others.

Our house has always been messy, but both my parents have always worked a lot and I would definitely give them a pass to some extent. They are also on my case all the time about being messy, which I have been forever along with everyone else. I have gotten a lot better in the last year. Yeah I leave a used paper plate out sometimes but my parents have plastic wear shoved in every cupboard and we’re eating on old news papers.

Anyways, we got into a fight and it escalated and I yelled at them. They are pretty high strung and stressed out and I know having a cleaner house that you can actually make a meal without moving things around to make room will make them more laid back. Am I the asshole for yelling in them in the house where they are providing a lot for me?

This past weekend, he competed in a triathlon (a 70.3, specifically).

I probably only saw my husband for a total of five minutes over the course of his five hour race.

People will line up along the railing of the finish line and watch the athletes come in.

With a couple minutes left to go, I held my phone up so I could practice taking some test shots. The woman behind me told me I was blocking her view. I told her my husband would be in any minute and I asked if anyone she knew was finishing around the same time. She said no but she still wanted to be able to see people come in. I told her that I would move as soon as my husband finished and then she could have a better view. She told me I was rude and I replied to her that I think she’s rude for hogging the finish line if no one she knew was finishing anytime soon.

I was with my sister in law driving out of state and we stopped at the doctor for my sons doctor appointment along the way,just a regular physical no big deal.  My son gets really nervous about getting naked and whenever he has to get naked with family he demands we take off our clothes to. I think it’s weird af but my wife has stripped down to her underwear when my son had to get naked so she could examine his rashes. It helped him feel more comfortable. 

My doctor had to get perform the physical which involved getting my son naked. My son started to panic and I tried to calm him down explaining it was normal and my sister in law demanded that the doctor strip to, the doctor of course said he couldn’t and I freaked out and I told my sister in law to stfu. I told her she’s being ridiculous and that I’m going to leave her if she persists. She kept demanding the doctor take off his clothes to which I told her I’m going to ask them to call security and she then shut up.

A little background...my relationship with his family has been bad since the beginning since I am of a different religion and culture, they do not accept me and only his mom has even met me. His brother has caused us lots of trouble and drama in the past (too long to get into here) and I don’t want my fiancé’s birthday to be full of drama so I told him I will not be joining them. Also, we already had made plans for me to take him out for dinner and fun at Dave & Busters (think adult ChuckECheese). I can’t be mad at him for cancelling our plans due to it being his birthday but I just didn’t want to add drama. 

He even tried to get me to join by saying he will talk to his brother to get him to apologize to me. For one, a forced apology is not an apology. For two, like I said earlier, I want his bday to be about him and not his family apologizing to me for how they have treated me, not the time and place imo.

bz84n1	2019-06-11 04:45:57	fazlachida	WIBTA if I take my boyfriend to therapy behind his family's back?	"For reference, I'm 17F and he's 18M. 

A lil bit of context: My boyfriend is the sweetest, purest man that I have ever met but lately he's been struggling a lot. 
Like 5 months ago, his parents decided to end their very, VERY difficult marriage and have been on a horrible divorce process since then. They constantly fight over everything, even after his dad moved out. To make things worse, both his younger siblings have taken sides (mom's or dad's) on the divorce, and constantly say rude or inappropriate comments about the other parent. 
Also, my bf has read every single divorce demand from both sides and oftenly reads the texts between his parents, all of these shown to him by them. 

 He now lives with his mom and siblings, and they are very close to their grandparents (mom's). 
The thing is, I now he needs help. I often tell him that I'll always listen to him and that I'll support him no matter what, but that he needs to see a professional because his stress levels are too high and he can't focus. He is also very angry and has started to show signs of being depressed. 
He doesn't want to tell his mom because she is already overwhelmed by this whole situation and he can't count on his dad. 
His grandmother has insisted that he goes talk to a priest she's friends with, who also does acupuncture. She claims that would fix him and make him feel better. When we (my bf and I) discussed the possibility of going to see a specialist in front of her, she got really mad and said the priest could do it and that he'll do it for free. 

Now, the AITA part: I respect the grandma's religious beliefs (she's very Catholic and I'm Christian) and her decision to go to alternative therapies for herself, but I do think my bf needs to see a psychologist. 

My mom gave me the contact of a really good one from her hospital and I've scheduled an appointment for him to go in two weeks. I did ask him if he felt comfortable and he just said that he wants some help, but doesn't know where from. I will be paying for this session. 

So, WIBTA?

EDIT: The grandma has been very vocal about being against psychologists and psychiatrists. She has told me a bunch of times that it disrespects religion and the power of faith, and that I don't understand it because I have different beliefs. I do consider myself very close to God and my pastors but I also go to therapy.
Overall she is very nice and loving, and has never been mean to me. I'm just worried about her thinking that I'm doing it on purpose."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bz83w2	2019-06-11 04:43:37	Ellendyra	AITA I asked my fiance not to tell my mom where I was.	"TL;DR My mom told me to do a chore her BF had told her to do. I didnt do it fast enough, she verbally assaulted me. So I paid someone else to do it and went grocery shopping instead.

A few phone calls, threats to kick me out and self-deprecating comments later boyfriend dropped me off at the hospital for joking about walking in front of a truck.

I asked him not to tell her where I was. Because I honestly felt like she'd accuse me of doing some ""power play"" instead of me actually being depressed. AITA?

 
MORE DETAILS:

At the time I was in my early twenties living at home

My fiance and I lived with my mother and her long time boyfriend in his house. (We paid rent, bought our own food and I cleaned up after us and my mother.)

One day, not much diffrent then any other my Mother woke me up and told me to mow the lawn, ASAP. Her BF had told HER to do it while he was at work. 

She was mad at him, so citing that as a reason I needed to, she told me to do it instead. 

Having just been abruptly woken up, I got ready for the day. (Bathroom, Breakfast, Dressed) It probably took an hour, maybe two. 

As I'm putting on my shoes to go mow, Mother calls and starts yelling at me because the yard wasnt mowed yet. 

So, now mad at my mom and feeling spiteful, I knocked on the neighbors door and offered her son $10 to mow our lawn.

Normally I'd suck it up, appologise etc but this was honestly a straw that broke the camel's back kind of thing. 

After paying the neighbor to mow, I woke up my boyfriend and told him we were going grocery shopping as we needed food and that was my original plan for the day.

We drove to Walmart. Meanwhile, Mother had gotten home so now I'm getting angry calls and texts. She threatens to kick me out etc. Called me ungrateful, selfish, etc.

At some point I got a phone call from the neighbor who I would confide in. She asked if I was ok. I said ""No"" and told her I often thought about walking into traffic.

My boyfriend, who was in the car and could hear our conversation took my phone when I hung up so I didnt have to talk to my mom anymore and drove me to a hospital and I was placed on a voluntary psyche hold. 

I asked him not to tell my mother where I was. 

The reason was anytime in my past I had tried to express my feelings, my mother would say it was just a power play, or a guilt trip and I'd end up feeling worse. 

When she couldn't contact me and my boyfriend wouldnt tell her where I was  she called the police to report me ""kidnapped"" when my boyfriend went to pick up our stuff..

The police just asked my boyfriend if I went willingly which of course I had. 

The officer even stayed so my boyfriend could get his stuff out of the house without my mom doing anything. Then advised my mother of proper eviction procedure when she demanded the cop make my boyfriend hand over our key."	Not the A-hole	0	0

She makes jokes about us having kids and makes up scenarios about us living together and I never shoot them down.

Today while she was cooking. She was making something that looked really good. She’s such an amazing cook and when I looked at what she was cooking I said “holy shit baby will you marry me” jokingly, I didn’t get in one knee or anything. Just kissed her on the cheek. She said “no, I don’t want to get married” I told her I was kidding and she said “I know” 

The thing is she’s always joking about marrying other people. She’s from another country and jokes about how if her male best friend ever needs a citizenships that he should marry her. She’s even jokingly married to him on FB. he’s even proposed to her with a fake ring and she said yes. (He’s gay btw).

The living room is right beside it and there's no walls or anything that can block sounds and my sister is there studying which I didn't know about but I doubt it cares. She told me to turn it down but she literally blasts music everywhere in the house morning to night and I don't really care about it but find it annoying sometimes so I said no just go upstairs to her own room where she can't hear me. She told me again to turn it down but yelling, so I raised the volume a bit higher, not enough that my parents upstairs sleeping can hear. Then she starts yelling at me how I'm selfish and whatnot but I just told her to go upstairs calmly. After a few minutes of her yelling one sidedly she finally went upstairs crying finishing it with ""I was stressing for the exams you never care about me"" which truthfully, I really don't care about her that much, as she never did anything for me regarding my problems and how this was the most simplest resolution where she can just go to her room.
As I was watching my videos for another 10min as you know, to stand my grounds I heard her cry and made me wonder if I did anything wrong because I didn't say anything that would hurt her. I still think I'm right but maybe I'm just not seeing smt."		1	0
bz812g	2019-06-11 04:34:38	bedroompopprincess	WIBTA If I told my boss to not hire my friend?	"Background: I'm 18 and so is my friend, F. We're both fresh out of high school. I've been working at a little sushi place for about five months now.
F is a great friend. I've known him for a long time. However, he's had a bit of a rough history. In the recent few years, he's developed a reputation for stealing. For example, he's stolen calculators and airpods and sold them to other classmates. Additionally, there's a locally beloved boba place that does that deal where it's like 'get ten stamp and get your 11th drink free!' F stole the stamp and gave people stamps on their cards in return for money. He also took a bunch of cards and stamped them for himself, essentially stealing hundreds from the boba place. Despite this, he turned to stealing because his situation was desperate and he was near-homeless. (I'm not saying that stealing is ever the answer, but I'm saying I understand where he was coming from, as a scared high-schooler who didn't know how to support himself, despite trying and trying to get an actual job just to survive.)
So I came in for my shift at the sushi place today, and F came in bright and early, dressed in interview attire. He asked if we were hiring. Now, on one hand, I'm hoping that he's trying to better himself. If he has a job, maybe he won't have to steal to make a living for himself. He'll have a lot more stability in his life, and our coworkers tend to support and care for each other, meaning he'll actually have a support line and possibly a reason to stay on the straight and narrow (not losing his job). On the contrary, I've developed a good rapport with my coworkers and my boss. I would feel like Brutus if I didn't tell them about his past. Furthermore, business is business. After all, I'm trying to look after not only my source of income, but also about 15 other peoples' income. This isn't one person's calculator that their mom bought them. This is 15 people barely making ends meet on minimum wage+maybe a $10-$20 tip.
Would I be the asshole if I advised my coworkers and/or the boss against hiring F?
EDIT: There are about 15ish employees, and 8-10 employees working at any given time. All of us are extremely close. It would become immediately obvious that F and I knew each other beforehand. I would definitely be TA for not warning my boss/coworkers about his tendencies. However, I would the TA to F if I ruined his chance at honest work, given he is trying to do it honestly."

bz80xy	2019-06-11 04:34:17	wjp1984	AITA for punishing my mom for dropping emotional text bombs?	"My mom and step-grandma do not get along since my grandfather passed. Even the idea of my wife or me communicating  with my step-grandma sends my mom off the deep end.  My mom also gets into these moods at night when she is drinking where she becomes a very angry, emotional person. I think she is mixing meds with alcohol. 

My wife and I are at dinner and she is texting my mom about scheduling some time to visit while they are in town next week. Fun stuff, like having my stay over or grabbing dinner while they are in town. 

My mom randomly sends me a text that reads “???”

I ask her what’s up and she goes off the deep end about how my wife and kids are going to their town and that she must be staying with or visiting my step-grandma (which totally isn’t the case). 

I explain to her that the wife and kids are staying at a friends house while in town.  I also explain to her that I haven’t seen my step-grandmother in over a year and that nobody brings her up in conversations except for her. 

She rapidly apologizes by text, but I’m tired of it. She does this sort of thing 3-4 times a year and it’s draining. I tell her that she can call me in the morning and apologize (it’s too easy to get away with apologizing by text). I also tell her that she needs to stop drinking at night. 

She says she won’t call to apologize, and that she has already apologized by text.  I tell her that I do not accept her text apology, at which point she tells me to  “clear my list”, she can’t do anything more. 

So I have removed her from my Facebook and also stopped texting her.  I doubt my wife’s plans with her and my kids to come to fruition (not of my doing).

bz7ybu	2019-06-11 04:26:05		AITA for taking my sisters car?	"ill try to keep it short, but need to give some context.

so my family has a few cars, but im (19f)only comfortable driving 2 (the others are my dads pickup and brothers sports car). i dont have a car because i go to school a few hours away for most of the year, cant afford one, and dont think i need one. my sister got a car because she commuted to college every day, although my parents pay for all of it, including insurance, lease, and gas. 

my moms car is more of the family car but she likes to call it hers.

now, i made plans with friends tonight and needed to drive there. i live in a very large city with great public transportation and normally take the train to any far neighborhoods. however, these friends live in an area with limited transportation, only very slow buses. as a result ubers/lyfts are very expensive. (and we wanted to go to a specific dinner and a movie in that area, so they couldnt come to my area)

i feel im past the stage where i need someone to drive me places and pick me up. not to mention that in the past, before i had my license, my family would complain about having to drive me around. i also feel like im a pretty good driver, as driving in a metro area is hard and ive been doing it for several years. 

so i asked my mom if i could take her car because she wasnt using it. she says ""no, i need it to keep a spot"". this is stupid because cars are meant to be driven, not meant to keep spots on the street, and we also have a driveway. she then says that she doesnt think im a good enough driver to take her car (bmw) because its ""too powerful"". i got pretty pissed off, because its a 9 mile drive on a highway ive been on many times, so nothing i cant handle. additionally, she has no problem with me taking her car when she wants me to do errands for her.

i then asked my sister for her car (nissan). she says no, she was driving to take a class at the gym at a certain time. This also pissed me off, because ive frequently driven her to and from the gym when she asks me without complaining. she almost never drives there. its also within walking distance. she then said she didnt wanna take my moms car because of the way it runs (it runs perfectly and shes just picky).

i told them that i needed one of their cars, or one of them needed to drive me or my mom needed to give me money for an uber. i then asked why couldnt my sister take my moms car to the gym and i could take her car if my mom has such an issue with me taking her car. they started arguing so i just took my sisters car and left. 

&#x200B;

i dont think it was unreasonable to ask for my sister to take my moms car and then i could take her car, seeing as my parents pay for both cars. if my sister paid for her car, then i would feel worse but i still feel kinda bad so AITA?"		1	0
bz7x6u	2019-06-11 04:22:32	Dude23232323	AITA for not tipping on a restaurant bill where I was overcharged by 40 dollars	"The story is I went to a restaurant with my girlfriend this weekend.  There was a two for one happy hour drink special going on and I ordered some nice drinks (rather than cheap beer) based on the two for one special.  I ordered the drinks in pairs thinking that I was getting two for one, like it said on the menu. 

At the end of the night, the bill comes in and the waiter has not applied the two for one drink special to the bill, causing a 40 dollar overcharge on what would have been a 100 dollar bill.  I ask the waiter to please fix the issues but he refused.  He claims that although the drink special says “2-4-1,” the bartender was supposedly pouring doubles and therefore I had gotten my monies worth.  I tell the waiter that the drinks seemed very weak.  In fact, they seemed weaker than single shots.  I kindly ask that he apply the discount to the discount to the bill.

The waiter refuses to apply the discount.  I decide not to argue about the issue and simply not to leave any tip.  I think it was fair not to tip since I was overcharged by 40 dollars.  My girlfriend agrees that I was overcharged, but thinks I’m the asshole here for not tipping.  She thinks it’s unfair that I didn’t tip because waiters generally rely on tips to make money.

He (40ish) has been married to his wife (40ish) for over a decade. They are the happy fun couple everyone loves, and who love each other a lot. He lives off her, and has since the beginning, tho he's not a deadbeat. He does creative work, and is reasonably good at it, but it doesn't pay the bills. In the past she called it a good balance -- he connects her to a lot of exciting events and people she'd otherwise miss out on, she finances it all.

Over the last few years tho he's gotten increasingly off -- (Not sure whether he's changed or I'm seeing him more clearly.) He's arrogant and pushy in conversation, bossy to her, never listens to anyone, interrupts at random, and gets touchy with anything resembling criticism. (He gets *really* insecure if anyone complains about work.). A few times it was so bad -- like him barking orders at her, or holding forth for ten minutes talking over everyone condescendingly on a topic he knows nothing about -- that I've considered reaching out to her.

Then recently he started sleeping with a young woman (20ish). He presents it like it's a mutual open relationship thing -- they're experimenting with ""polyamory,"" etc -- and tho his wife is trying to go along with it, she's clearly a mess. She's having breakdowns, crying suddenly, reaching out to me upset, etc, but he's acting like this is just some aberration -- like she's having difficulty managing her emotions but is basically on board. (Or even like she's being unfair to him because she keeps saying one thing and doing another.)

The other day she called me and was such a mess it was like textbook battered spouse syndrome. (Apologizing constantly, moralizing about needing to be open, etc.) I don't think he's physically abusive, but I worry he's just worn her down with his total lack of self-awareness. I tried to make him see what was happening, and now he's basically not talking to me, and I'm so disgusted with him I don't care. We've been friends since our early 20's, and he's been there through a lot, but I just feel done with him. Like he's hurting her, knows he is, but wants what he wants, and will only be around people who validate it.

Am I an asshole for kind of never wanting to see him again? I've been through an abusive relationship myself, and I feel like once people reveal themselves as capable of crossing that line they're dead to me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We were constantly fighting over everything and over the last month or so, it was pretty bad but both of us kept saying we wanted to make an effort to fix it but it just got worse and worse. I went to his graduation but it was the day after he decided to officially break up with me because I didnt act like I cared about him (however it was the day after my dog died and that same day he said he never wanted to see me again)

Since we broke up, I tried to at least remain friends with him and he wanted that too but would fight with me over whose fault it was that we broke up. Sometimes he would tell me he loved me and wanted me back while other times he would tell me I was manipulative and abusive and that he made the right call.

 I was his first relationship and I understand how confusing it is for him, but he also doesnt have many friends or the people that he considers his friends are mine that tolerated him because of me and dont actually like him all that much. He still invited me to his graduation party that he told me about months ago but I also have to work that day to run a special karate party at my job. That was the last straw for him and he was very upset that I said I might not be able to come and then blocked me on snapchat because talking to me did nothing but stress him out. 

After he blocked me, a mutual friend messaged me on snapchat to show me a screenshot from his story where he basically advised people to be wary of abuse in their relationships because it's hard to tell the difference sometimes. I never told this friend to tell me anything about what my ex was up to but he still felt the need to let me know this was happening. 

I originally planned on going if my job let out because I value him as a person and know I'm one of the few people that know him the best, but if hes gonna call me an abuser on his snapchat story for our mutual friends to see, I'm not so sure anymore. 

So i guess basically what I'm asking is would i be the asshole if i didnt go considering what hes doing after he blocked me or should I still go because he maintained his invitation even after the break up?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bz7str	2019-06-11 04:09:46	Tolguacha	AITA not letting my brothers gf stay with us?	" Hello, re-post cause character limit. 

Quick background: I (24F) recently took in my little brother (19M) because our mother had to suddenly move away. I also inherited four cats - this is relevant. My little brother is going to uni four days a week - he pays me rent and a small portion of the bills. My little brother (Tom), has a girlfriend (18F), named Holly.  However, Holly has previously confided in me that her mother is routinely nasty to her (filling up Holly's room with the mothers stuff and forcing Holly to sleep on a pile of towels in the living room) etc. 

My landlord has approved my little brother to move in with me, but not Holly. She has no job, no money and isn't attending any sort of school and so can't help with bills, rent etc. This has been her situation for over three years. She tells me that she's fine with this, and yet she spends every day at my house, even when no-one else is there. 

The other day, she had been staying at my house for the last four days and I offered to drop her home. She asked me if there was even any point in her going home, as she had been away from home for the last month. I told her I didn't mind if she went home, but she couldn't stay here. She seemed to be taken aback, which I thought was odd, as we had established several times that my landlord hadn't approved her staying and we had an agreement that she would stay two days a week. She had the same ""arrangement"" with my mother, but it turns out my mother would often just let her stay for weeks at a time, paying for everything she (Holly) needed, instead of actually enforcing the agreement.

She went to Tom's room for a while and then came back and then began to talk about how uncomfortable her bed is, how she can't sleep at that house, and how the last time her mother was being unfair, she went to her Dad, but he just took her home again and how she doesn't know why he didn't want her etc. This made me feel like I was being guilt-tripped in my own home, which upset me, so I told her that if she really hates it there that much, she needs to get a job or get govt assistance so she can get her own house/flat. We don't live in the USA so this is fairly common.

I took her home. Tom told me that her home life isn't great right now and that he thinks it was super rude of me to tell her to ""just move out"" and to not let her stay. I can't afford to get caught with an extra person in my house, as I might lose my tenancy, and even if that weren't the case, neither Tom or I can really afford to pay for her to live with us.

Reason being is because it's the most infuriating experience eating with them. Dinner at the house always consists of some sort of argument or random unnecessary lecture, when I'm eating dinner I just want to eat without some sort of BS interruption about my apparent shortcomings in life. Eating out is just embarrassing, to make it short my parents have a better relationship with my younger siblings, they laugh at each others jokes, they always try to have some sort of fun when out, but it's just not appropriate at times IMO especially in public and I hate having all the attention drawn to us sometimes because of loud everyone can be.

Last night my mom wanted me to come eat with everyone and of course I told her I'd eat later as usual. She proceeds to go off about how I never want to eat with everyone wherever and that everyone wants to spend time with me. Well the feeling isn't mutual, my family can't grasp the concept that I can't stand eating with them because of how annoying they are. When I'm tell them this I get looked at like I'm a piece of shit."	Asshole	0	0

I was helping my mom at a festival type thing, where she and her friends were running a shop (along many others). I was asked if I wanted to help, and agreed to it. (I was promised $40-$60) As we reached the shop (all of them are easy-up type things), I notice it's crowded with more people working than I expected (7-10 people under 2 tents). I said hello, and was told that I was assigned to sell masks (plastic masks). I was fine with this job, and I stood next to the rack of masks, where I was told to be. I noticed that while other people working at these 2 tents had certain things that would help people to know that they were working there, I was not given one, as there were none left. The masks were more of a side, and the main thing for the shop was an activity involving candy. I was able to make many sales, and as it reached lunch time, my mother (and the person who ran the shop) told me I could get lunch. I headed out and found a line for food. It was a lengthy line, and I ended up waiting for a good 5-10 minutes. After I got my food, I headed back to the shop, where somebody who was working on the main activity had taken over for my spot. I ate lunch, and noticed that the person was still there (This place was very crowded, I was around 13-14), so I didn't have any spot I could work at (some people had short shifts and new people would fill in for them, but they were all friends, so I they would hand the job over to their friend while they talked). I threw away my lunch and asked my mom what I could do to help. She told me I could go get dessert, or something. I went and got a snow cone and ate it. I came and they were still in my spot so I couldn't do the job. At this point, it was nearing the point where my shift was ending, so I had to just wait it out. I ended up only getting paid $20 (yes, while I do appreciate it, I was promised at least double that) and was met with a curt ""go now"". The festival had multiple days, and that was the first. I had originally planned on working 2 of the days, but the shop owner spread rumors (to my mom only maybe) that I said I wouldn't be working there tomorrow. I had never said that."
