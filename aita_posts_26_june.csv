&#x200B;

My best friend has made a couple jokes about me getting together with another close friend and has advised me a couple times to dump my fiancé. My fiancé found out, and was hurt, mostly due to stuff that happened in our past. She told me she doesn't feel comfortable with me talking to him. I think they're just harmless jokes, and that she is being too controlling.

This may seem dumb and insignificant but this one situation basically sums up my relationship with my brother. 

It’s been reaching high 90s where we live so it’s time to break out the fans. We have several tower fans that require some assembly. I set one up in my room and two  in the living room at my mom’s request. She told my brother to assemble one for his own room but he insisted that he didn’t need one. 
A few days later I went into his room to wake him from his nap and saw both fans from the living room there. I didn’t wake him up and I took the two fans with me. I felt it was unfair that I did all the work and he was reaping the rewards(which happens very often actually).  I thought my actions were justified but everyone said I was wrong and rude because  “we’re family so we should help each other out”.

c60mft	2019-06-27 03:49:33	EnemyAdensmith	AITA for abandoning this guild? ( Epic gamer nerd stuff )	"So I play a game called Elder Scrolls Online ( ESO ) I met this dude and was gettalong with him. We just talked about stupid bullshit. Few days later he invites me to a guild that has pretty much no one in it, and have me be a member. I had nothing to do at the time and I just thought getting in would probably make the dude a little happy. 

The usual guild shit happens, pay x amount a week ( it was cheap so I didn't mind it ). And hes trying to make me install an app so I can be in communication with the 15 other guild mates. I didn't install it and he seemed suprised that I wasn't  the group chat, so I missed a few guild ""meetings"". 

One to Two weeks later, he messages me on xbox chat saying to come over to one of his friends player homes for a guild meeting. Only 2 other people are there, one of which is 15 and the other is afk. Once every thing gets settled, he says he wants to promote me even though I did nothing. 

I was against this because well...I just wanted to play the game without having to deal with too much guild drama and responsibilities wheing me down. He said that I wouldn't have to do anything, just monitor chat and try to recruit everyone I saw in the game. Again, I said that I didn't want to have to deal with having to  be a mod for the guild. It seems like this didn't quite go through because...I was promoted anyways. 

Weeks later, the Elsweyr dlc is out and I'm excited! I play through half of the story enjoying it. Mr.Dude ( not his GT)  messages me again telling me to collect dues recruit people and assign them to tasks or some shit because he was going to be gone for two weeks. I really didn't want to do it but A is for Affort so I tried anyways to see what I could do with the guild members...every one has been off for atleast two weeks.

At this point I'm just want to say fuck it and quit the damn guild because I just want to play the damn game, some time passes, and he sends me a xbox message saying he will be gone for another week and to continue doing this crap. At that moment, I just got onto the game just to leave the guild, then blocked him.

So I'm kinda stuck on this because I feel bad for just leaving the dude...but at the same time I didn't want to babysit his guild for him and take responsibility for it.

Edit: Reason why I didn't confront him is because he was going to be gone for another week and he can get in a pissy mood"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I don’t enjoy spending time with her at all. I still talk to her and try to have conversations but the conversations are very childish and repetitive and her interests are of that of a child. She’s obsessed with being a kid and reliving her childhood.
I feel very bad for her obviously, but I just don’t like going out in public with her like to the mall or out to eat she behaves strangely. I don’t like the stares that people give but more so the way she makes me feel, like with her eyes. She has a very scary stare.
My mom says I’m a bitch for not spending enough time with her, because she tells my mom that I never take her out ever and she’s so sick. But I just can’t get myself to spend anymore time with her than I already do because she freaks me out.

c60m3b	2019-06-27 03:48:29	iteachcalculusbc	AITA for forcing myself to bond with my boyfriend/fiance's daughter?	"So I’ve been dating a guy since 2012 or so and we recently got engaged this year (2019) on Valentine’s Day. My fiance has 2 kids, 20 and 18--from a previous relationship--one will be a junior in college and the other just graduated high school. Their mom isn’t involved in their lives at all and does not even live in the same country. 

However, I didn’t really meet them until late 2014/early 2015 when my then-boyfriend and I knew that we were serious. 

I’ve always got along well with the 18 year old because he’s relaxed and easygoing, but I’ve had more problems with the 20 year old girl. When we first met, she’d always try to find ways to avoid talking to me or speak awfully of me behind my back. She even stopped going over to my fiance’s house and instead chose to alternate living between her aunts/uncles’ homes because of me (this was when she was under 18 and legally under her dad’s care).

At some points, it was so bad that my fiance debated whether he should keep dating me or not, and I really didn’t want to break up with him. 

When she was about 17-19 or so, we got closer. Her dad dragged her to therapy after some behavioral problems/depressive symptoms, and we learned from her therapist that she had a lot of trauma from not having a consistently emotionally available mom figure in her life. 

Because I teach high school, I know how to get along decently with teenagers (am one of the more popular teachers at my HS) and what it’s like to be a 17-19 year old girl from personal experience. I used those experiences to kind of try and force myself and bond with her to be the ""mom"" figure she lacked. I started going to her soccer games, dance shows, and school rallies when she was 16 and a junior in high school. 

I just generally tried to show I cared for her by giving her hugs, listening to her friend/boy drama problems, and buying her things she liked. I think she likes me more now than before--I’m the first person she hugs when she comes back home from college and all that--although she is still closer with her aunts (she grew up under their care because my boyfriend was young when he had her and was in medical school full-time). She planned out a nice Mother's Day celebration for me this year too (explained that she wasn't comfortable doing it before we were engaged). She only came over 3-4 days a week when she was in high school, so it was doable. 

However, now that my fiance and I are engaged and getting married in either 2020 or 2021, I wonder if I would actually be able to handle having her long-term in my life. I feel like such an asshole for kind of faking my bond with my fiance’s daughter, especially when it comes so naturally with my fiance’s son and in light of our impending marriage. I do appreciate that she is pretty, well-liked, resourceful, and smart (attends a college that's Ivy level) but I am not sure if I love her or ever will.

c60ld4	2019-06-27 03:46:26		AITA for leaving midst helping my friend?	"My friend (kind of, we have also been casual before) recently had an end of year exhibition at his university and sent me a message earlier today saying he has to go to university to pick up his stuff if I am up for it and can see the exhibition. He said he wouldn’t be the most fun though because he has a sore throat. I said sure. I’m currently going through a major depressive episode and it helped perk me up just enough to get out of my room. I told him that I was going through a bad episode of depression the day before this event. 

We met up, went straight to his uni and picked up one big portfolio case and one framed picture roughly the same size. I was thinking that surely this 6’0 guy would be able to do it himself, but whatever. He then asks me what my plans are after, thinking maybe he’d suggest to do something easy as we are both not feeling great. I say nothing, to which he mentions that he is going home. I say, oh so you were just using me? In a light tone. We start to walk back. My head starts thinking that how silly I was to think that a friend would want to hang out with me and see if I’m ok because I said I was depressed etc. 

We get to his stop and he insinuates that we get off - just for me to carry it to his house and then I’d just go straight home by myself. I was really upset at this time, I know that this was clouded because of my depression and anxiety, but I said to him I’m not getting off because I don’t like feeling used for his sole benefit after I told him I was depressed. He said that this is what he insinuated and just shrugged his shoulders and got off the train."		1	0

c60hx2	2019-06-27 03:36:23	plutoisrising	AITA for ghosting my best friend of 8 years because she only talks about her problems and doesn’t seem to care about mine	I’ve been best friends with this girl for 8 years, we were inseparable during high school and she’s been there for me during some rough times as a teenager. I moved away for college but we stayed in contact and I’d spend every holiday with her. She ended up meeting new people at college and has a new circle of friends who I’m not really fond of, the issue is I’ve noticed for the past year that our hangouts have become a therapy session for her, she complains about her boyfriend and the drama within her circle of friends and never asks about what I’m up to or how I’m doing and it’s become a hassle to go meet her. I’ve been slowly avoiding her because I’m going through so much myself but ended up agreeing to hangout and she was talking about her issues with her boyfriend the entire time and then casually asked why I’ve been avoiding her calls and texts and I told her that I’ve been diagnosed with depression and she said something within the lines of “oh I’m so sorry” then redirected the conversation back to her issue with her boyfriend. I’ve since decided that I want nothing to do with her and just completely ghosted her for the past 3 months, she texts/calls me almost weekly asking what she did, telling me she misses me, begging me to answer and I feel horrible but I don’t want her in my life anymore and I hate confrontation. I was telling my sister about this and she said that I was being a horrible person for cutting her off but I feel like it would probably make it worse if I tell her that I can’t stand her complaining all the time and that I don’t find our time together enjoyable anymore. This is truly harder than any break up I’ve been through and I don’t really know what to do.	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Two of my dads dogs are breeding dogs and this is r's second litter of pups. She is extremely ready to give birth and if she doesn't give birth today or tomorrow,  she will while i'm there.

Context: my dad lives 30 minutes from me including road construction time and i'm a teenager who can't drive yet. My dad only said I would be watching his dogs, I assumed it should just be the still pregnant r, and the other two dogs hanging out, but because of r being ready to give birth to a full litter at any moment, I will have to spend the entire weekend at his house. 


More context, I have a weird thing,  a flaw, a quirk, whatever you wanna call it. Idk if it is anxiety, OCD, or anything like that but I can't sleep in strange places. I can't even move the contents of my room and still sleep through the night. I'm at my sisters house all day every day, but I still can't sleep there, I trust my best friend 100% i'm there all the time, but I can't sleep there.

c60fck	2019-06-27 03:29:34		AITA for getting fed up beyond my breaking point at my 9 year old niece?	"(This is a throwaway in case my family finds this sub)

Where do I even start? My niece is 9 years old, and she’s the most stressful child I’ve ever known. Day in and day out I get more and more annoyed with having to deal with her. 
She doesn’t listen to anyone at all. 
She doesn’t get grounded. She doesn’t get put in time out. She doesn’t get spanked. 
She runs through the house all day long screaming! No matter how many times she’s asked to settle down or to be quiet it’s like she just gets louder and more defiant.
She also is never around other children and she doesn’t go to school. 
She also doesn’t have a bed time, so she will be up until 7 in the morning every single day! 
If I try to talk to her or put her to bed at a NORMAL time, I get yelled at. I get told “leave her alone.” 
But it’s okay for her to be up and running and screaming all day long and into the late hours of the morning? 

The other day I was so frustrated with her because I told her to please stop messing with my stuff on the table, which she ignored me, and after the sixth time I asked her to stop I picked her up and swatted her on the butt. 
Her mother and my father were not happy with me at all and started telling me that “I need to be nicer to her”.
I am just fed up.

Okay, so I’m a song writer and I just got out of a serious relationship almost a year ago now. We were together for almost 5 years and were briefly engaged. While we were together, I wrote a few songs for her, one of which I sang to her before I proposed. She said yes but a couple weeks later things ended badly. My current girlfriend, who I’ve been with for about a year now, is aware of the previous relationship and has heard the song and everything (I have them on Spotify and YouTube and stuff) but it’s never really come up. Fast forward to last Saturday, quiet evening, we were just hanging out in our apartment and I had my guitar out and everything, I started playing the song (the one I proposed to my ex with) for her. As soon as I finished playing it she seemed really pissed off and ended up going out for a bit. I guess I can kind of see how this could’ve been weird, but the song has changed meaning for me now that I’m with her. I meant no harm by it and thought it’d be romantic. So reddit, AITA?"

Husband also made plans to meet middle son and his family before the wedding to have lunch & to do some sightseeing downtown.  I told him I will not be going, and he is upset with my decision.  My reason for skipping is that we have a very elderly dog (she's 17) who is handicapped and needs to be walked with a sling.  Factoring in driving time, sightseeing, wedding, and whatever else, it could leave her stuck inside and 'holding it' for possibly 9 hours or more, and I feel that is just too long.

I started working at a gym in May. I lifeguard two days a week and help out with the youth wrestling program 2 days a week. Through working there I met a girl (16F) who goes to a different school. We usually take our lunch breaks around the same time and realized we have a lot in common. Last week we started meeting up to play basketball at the gym and run the track. I asked her to go see a movie with me this Friday and she said it should be okay but she has to ask her parents first. She came to me today and said her parents are okay with it but want to meet me first. I thought that sounded normal and I asked if they knew I was black. She was visibly taken aback and said, ""No. Do you think my parents are racist?"" I told her that I wasn't assuming they were racist but you never know and I didn't want to walk into some messed up situation. I don't think it'll be like ""Get Out"" or anything and know it's 2019, but I have white friends who say their parents wouldn't be okay with them dating interracially so it's obviously still 'a thing' in my area, which is a majority white southern town. I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable or surprised, so I figured a heads up would be fair. 

I explained this to her and she asked if she ever did anything to make me think that she comes from a racist family. I again told her that it's not that I think her family is racist. It's more that I don't know if they are or not and didn't want to make things weird and I don't want to start liking her only to realize she can't date me. I asked if she ever dated anyone in general before and she said the one boyfriend she had was white and she never felt the need to tell her parents that before they met him. I eventually just asked if we could drop it and she agreed. She texted me back later today and said, ""If you aren't comfortable meeting my parents then maybe it's best if we hold off on the date until sometime in the future when you are more comfortable."" I told her I wasn't uncomfortable, asked if she was mad, and she just texted back ""See you at work."" 

I asked some of my friends, sample size of 8. Two of the other minorities (one Latinx and one Black) said they would expect the other person to tell the parents. My Asian friend agreed with my white friends that it would be weird to disclose race.

I was supposed to be given back $13, however I was only given back $3. I didn’t catch the mistake until I got home later that day, and I didn’t want to make a big deal out of $10 so I didn’t call to complain. I always tip $10 whenever they do my nails no matter who it is. So I guess you can say the lady was tipped $20 that day that she did my nails. Today when I got them done I didn’t tip her at all because I just figured I tipped her the other day that she didn’t give me back the correct change.

c602pz	2019-06-27 02:55:04	MsFoxtrot	WIBTA if I trapped stray kittens in our apartment complex and brought them to a shelter without consulting my neighbor?	"I live in a pet-free apartment complex that is home to many stray cats, which we have been explicitly told by management not to feed or water, since it tends to result in them using certain areas of the complex as a litter box.

There is 1 male and 2-3 female strays and at least 2 of the females have given birth in the past few weeks. We discovered (because there are decently sized gaps in our fence) that all of the cats and kittens have been living in our neighbors yard and that our neighbors are giving them water (and possibly food). There are 6-10 kittens and 3-4 adult cats living there. Just tonight, the kittens started venturing into our yard and hanging out/playing there.

Now, I would like to help get these kittens adopted and get mamas (who are only about 9 months) and dad fixed. The local shelter will fix the parents free of charge and adopt the kittens out if they are still young enough to be socialized. It is a no kill shelter. I know someone with traps and knowledge who will help me do this. I have the approval of the property manager to do this.

My hesitation is that, even though pets are not allowed, my neighbors may conceive of these cats/kittens as belonging to them. None of the traps would be placed in their yard or unit, only in the building common areas and our yard. They shouldn’t have a problem with me helping these cats/kittens, but I am worried they will basically think I’m “stealing” their kittens since they are on some level caring for/housing them.

I, at 19, recently got my ""infertile"" girlfriend pregnant. Decided to have my dad call her and tell her the news and apparently she didn't take it well said that it wasn't fair that we're so young and currently, isn't talking to me or my dad. We never talked much, just a text here and there, she probably called dad once a week (she lives a couple hours away). 

My girlfriend no longer wants my sister in the child's life, and thinks she's being an irredeemable asshole,  just because she's had friends who took the news well.

"Context- I work at a food truck,I go back to the kitchen to clean and prep for the next day with other workers every day after the shifts ends.I usually stay longer for prep and clean up than my intended schedule hours (i.e schedule till 5pm but don't actually leave later at 5:30pm or 6pm)

Story-I go by my day as usual.As I was busy doing prep work for tomorrow,(Mind you I was already  tired from working the shift and cleaning the truck.) Comes my older co-worker who doesn't speak much English started begging me to wait for the food that she prepped to cool down in the blast chiller and store it in the walk-in freezer. (She came to me for help because I help her out last week with the same problem as a one time time thing.and i usually don't mind helping her out but I just want to leave early for once) I said no several times and continued to finish my work. When I was heading to the clock out area and leave, I saw that she changed into her other clothes, ready to leave as well, waiting for me to help her out.I had enough at this point, I said ""no"" and walked out the kitchen to clock out else where. After several minutes I went back to the kitchen to grab my things and the food was in the walk-in. I guess she put the food back herself...

Extra context- 
My co-worker started her day earlier than me, which means she have the whole day to cook and put that food away(which is her role in the company/job) in the early afternoon instead of cooking it couple hour before she leaves and ask me to put it away.

TL:DR-didn't want to help my co-worker to do her job, so that she can leave early and I have to stay longer than intended.

So AITA for not helping my co-worker who wants me to do her part of the job, while I stay longer at work?


EDIT-i forgot to mention there was another worker who was schedule to stay later to help out with the work."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5zy71	2019-06-27 02:42:36	TrashPotatoes	AITA for telling my mother to seek therapy?	"OK so the run down of this is My mother all throughout her life has been in relationships with various men who are/ were physically and mentally abusive to my mother( and us her children) now over a year ago my mother finally left her soon to be ex-husband who was very physically and mentally abusive to my mother and little sister (now 10). she has since found herself in a relationship with a man who is actually very attentive to her wants and needs and has taken on the father role to my little sister. 

BUT...

&#x200B;

my mother has become so paranoid that he is cheating on her, or texting other women behind her back that he has called me crying multiple times because he says he loves my mother, but he doesn't know how much more of this he can take.  he got rid of his facebook account, she has full access to his phone and they practically spend every minute of the day together except for when he goes to work, and even then she goes to visit him and brings him lunch etc. 

&#x200B;

I know my mom has issues with depression and anger and she has been diagnosed with PTSD and has started hoarding useless things, but she refuses to seek actual treatment for anything she claims she is fine and I just don't know the whole side of the story and she accuses me of taking her boyfriends side, then says its none of my business if and when they fight.  the past 3 years she has been making less and less contact with family and friends, staying at home, and almost obsessing over catching something wrong in her relationship.  My little sister has  developed issues about 2 years before my mother left her husband  such as she breaks down sobbing when people raise their voice, cowering in corners and wetting herself. 

&#x200B;

I know they need some sort of therapy especially my little sister. and I finally broke down on the phone and told her she needs to get help or nothing will get any easier or better. she hung up the phone and is no longer answering my calls. I live in a different state, and the drive to get to her house takes 10 hours.  AITA for finally speaking up about my mother neglecting to seek therapy for herself and my sister?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Last night my dad just happened to spring on us that my Cousin who was moving from Honduras to the U.S was planning on staying with us for a bit in order to get her self together and get used to the new country and atmosphere. She’s making the move due to financial issues and couldn’t look to her own parents back in Honduras for help because “they had their own families to look for” . I instantly asked my dad why he agreed so quickly “don’t you also have you’re own family to look for”? To which he responded that she and her husband couldn’t make it here alone without help. So turns out it’s not only her staying with us but her husband and five year old child.  To give you some background knowledge, my family of 6 lives in a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house. I was already on the fence when I heard she was planning to stay but to find out it’s her whole family staying, I didn’t hesitate to tell my dad that I didn’t like the idea. He immediately jumped on my case saying that I didn’t care about my family, that I was selfish, and that he was ashamed that I didn’t care about others.  I honestly don’t know if I am truly in the wrong here, the way I see it I’m already so claustrophobic in this house and adding 3 more people who I don’t even have a relationship with to the mix would probably be the thing to push me over the edge and force me to move out. I offered him different ways to help out even tried asking if his other family members who live here and have the space could take them in. He won’t listen to what I say and continues to believe that I’m a selfish human.  So am I being selfish? Should I try looking at it through another perspective?



Edit : I should also add that no one else is for it including my mother, but apparently it’s my father who has the last say. I also have been wanting to move out but my parents aren’t fond of the idea and want me to stay with them through college. I also have a job and can financially support myself."	No A-holes here	0	0

c5zvgd	2019-06-27 02:35:26	HolyBobTrumpet	AITA For getting angry at my Sister for lying about my financial situation?	"For some context, I am a single parent of one I lost my job a year ago; it didn't pay well so I had very little savings, I am now living of centrelink, whilst I study so I have some more qualifications to work with.

Two months ago I was asked by a family member to borrow a large sum of money, I of course said I couldn't afford to lend anyone money as I had bills to pay and a child to feed. They didn't bring the matter back up, but it was the beginning of a long line of family members asking for loans. Everyone loan was denied.

Yesterday my dad asked to borrow $1000aud so that he could fix my mum's car, I told him that I couldn't  lend him money as I don't have that much, to which I got the retort of ""That's not what your sister told us 3 months ago"".  He left off of it but I did offer to put $200 towards the car as my mother did pick up and drop off my daughter twice a week he was greatful.

Last night when I got home I call my Sister and put her on blast about it, and her only retort was ""It saves people asking me for loans"".

This morning I got a very long and disappointed message from my mother about me not being charitable and bullying my Sister.

Am I the asshole for being angry at my Sister for lying to everyone about my financial situation?

I was completely destroyed, this being my first love. For awhile we would text and even talk on the phone like nothing happened, but then we both decided to keep our space so we could try to move on. 

Moving on for me was very difficult because I had convinced myself that we would eventually get back together. I kept this up for about 4 weeks. My X then leaves for a mission trip in Africa, this was the first time I felt peace since we broke up. While she was gone I went to a party and ended up chatting with this random girl, as the night progresses we end up making out and we exchanged snapchats. 
A few weeks later I invite her to a party and she comes, she has no place to stay so I offer her my place. We sleep in the same bed but there was no sex, which I rather liked.
A few more weeks go by and my X starts talking to me again, but I shut her down because I’m trying to figure out what the hell I’m doing or want to be doing in my dating life.
She then gets very angry, and blocks me on social media and tells me not to talk to her for awhile. This is because of my rejection and because of this other girl(my X found out through a friend of hers that was at the party also.)

This whole thing has made me super angry, very guilty, and frankly hysterical. I just don’t know what to do and what is right.

c5zspa	2019-06-27 02:27:42		WIBTA if I withdrew some of my support for my best friend who I am in love with, after her mother passed away?	"For a little background on the situation..I’ve been in love with my best friend (who I will refer to as CD) for 5 years now and I’m pretty sure she has no idea. 

We’re both 24 and female. Falling in love with her opened my eyes to the fact that I’m bisexual, however, I haven’t told anyone about this yet. We’ve been best friends since high school, spending literally every day together. Around 5 years ago, a situation occurred where it really opened my eyes to seeing that I might love her more than just a normal friend love. Back when we were both single, we would frequently go out to clubs and then come back to her place and fall asleep in each other’s arms. This happened ALL of the time. I’d wake up to her stroking my hair or with her arms right around me. One night, like the others, we came home from the club and we were lying in her bed, when all of a sudden she kissed me. We ended up making out literally all night long. It was the most exciting experience I’ve ever had! But we played with each other’s emotions and never really talked about what we were feeling/ she identifies as straight. A few months after the kiss occurred, we both started dating other men. During this time, I grew to love my boyfriend but I knew deep down that I also still loved her. Naturally, we became a little more distant as people do when they get into relationships. CD and I fell into more of “normal” friendship. The feelings of being in unrequited love only became bearable because we grew a little distant. As of today, I am single and she is still with the same guy. 

A few weeks ago, CD’s mother passed away suddenly of a heart attack. CD was extremely close to her mother and I was always very close to her mother as well. The 3 of us would often hangout. She is absolutely devastated. Her mother was her person. Ever since this has happened, she has had my unyielding support. I’ve helped with some of the funeral arrangements and just generally have been there for her as she grieves and cries and screams and goes through the worst time of her life. 

The dilemma that I’m having right now, is being around her every day, all day long like I used to be, has made my old feelings come back for her ten fold. Like, I am in love with this girl. But I don’t want to be. I just want to be her friend and not have these feelings. WIBTA if I withdrew some of my support and took time for myself? The only way I can stop these torturous feelings is when I completely distance myself from someone for a bit. I think it would be best for my mental health if I did but I feel guilty because she needs me right now.

He is a musician (not his day job) and his friend is visiting from x-country in a few months. We live in a 2 bedroom, where one room is our bedroom and the second room is his music room. We also split the rent 50/50. When his friend visits, he plans on them recording an album and getting as much of it done as possible. I know, that I will have little advance notice with their recording schedule as some of them have pretty erratic schedules. I don't mind 1x week them having the band over to record, but at the end of the day, I work a stressful job and just want to come home and chill in my underwear and not worry about who is home and making small talk. I did ask him to pay for a large percentage of our rent for that month as I feel that this would be the most fair solution to the both of us and his reaction was less than ideal. AITA?

I received an IM very shortly thereafter (very small office, so coworker overheard everything) that read ""Thanks for defending me there,"". Coworker is no longer speaking to me because of my exchange with the office manager.

I should add that the issue office manager was commenting on is an ongoing and oft repeated error on coworker's part. That EVERYONE in the office is well aware of.

My cousin is moving in with us for two main reasons as I’m told, reason one is because frankly we need the help finically and two she can’t find anywhere to live, she WAS supposed to continue living where she is now until the fall and would have time to search but for one reason or another her and her roommate have broken their lease and have to move out soon. 

Now I’d say we live in a fairly small home, we had to build a wall separating the living room just so that there is another bedroom for the people already living here which is four people, myself, my mom, my aunt and my aunts boyfriend. Add on to that my two cats and this place is pretty cramped. I also find that people are inconsiderate about my wishes already and I don’t want to have to worry about another person, which by the way did I mention she has two cats she is bringing?

I do want to mention I am currently 18, I just graduated high school, and I’ve not have a real job yet. My mom has done a lot for me and I always offer to help her out finically because I can and if I couldn’t I’d get a job to do so but she says it’s never needed. 

I know this is a bit of a simple situation but because of my role in my family Im not sure how much of my dislike of this is ok for me to have. 

TL;DR - my mom told my cousin who owns two cars and who needs a place to stay it is ok to move in for the summer while we already lived in a small home with 4 people and two cats, I don’t contribute to the household in any meaningful way am I justified to dislike that this is happening?

"My younger brother Jake bragged to me about on FaceTime yesterday about how he hooked up with a MILF last weekend on tinder. Naturally, I thought she was probably someone 24-25 (for reference, my brother is a senior in high school and just turned 18). But then he tells me how this woman is 32 and has a daughter that goes to the elementary school our other (younger) brother goes to. 

Naturally I’m concerned for him. This woman is almost double his age and preying on a high schooler. For reference, I’m 25 and thinking of sleeping with someone under 19 actually makes me viscerally ill. 

I told him that he needs to stop seeing her and he was like absolutely not. I tried lecturing him about grooming and how he needs to find someone closer to his maturity and experience-level and he just laughed and said whatever. 

I texted him yesterday telling him that he seriously needs to stop and he ignored me. I decided to tell our mom this morning about what he did. I didn’t want to be a “snitch” but I felt it was for his own good. I asked if she can say she saw a tinder message on his phone or something but to NOT tell him I told him.  

My brother called me 20 minutes later **livid**. My mom chewed him out and told him she was going to track his phone for the rest of his summer in addition to going through his phone every day because “she couldn’t trust him to behave” (our mom is very old-fashioned, so she’s DEATHLY afraid of online apps in addition to the fact that she was so old). He told me I’m a little bitch, and to no longer speak with him. I tried calling him but I think he blocked me because I go straight to voicemail every time I call him. 

I don’t think he gets I did this to protect him. He’s too young to see that this woman is a predator. AITA?

c5zdka	2019-06-27 01:47:42		AITA for refusing to steal but letting my girlfriend do it instead?	"TLDR at the bottom.

So my girlfriend and I have been living in a hotel for a month due to clinical rotations and they have a gym. Keep in mind this isn’t a four star resort, it’s more of a lower end hotel with not the most outstanding of inhabitants. We’re broke college kids so we fit right in but there is quite the riff raff around.  There’s also some good people and family’s just passing through the city.

So we were working out one day and towards the end of my workout I noticed that there were a pair of headphones sitting on the window ledge. They looked kinda cheap but as I walked closer my pulse picked up a tiny bit cause they had a very recognizable shape. I picked them up, turned them to the side, and let out a “Oh f***” because they were beats.

Solo 3 wireless ones with a MSRP of $200 to be precise. Now for most people in my situation this would be Christmas in June, but I’m a guilty person. So right away I thought to myself “there’s no way I could take these” but my girlfriend who was watching this transpire told me I should. I explained to her that someone would be devastated losing something like this and they might come back looking for them. She agreed and ended up leaving while I finished my lift.

However, I couldn’t stop thinking about the possibilities. The first and most ideal would be the owner coming back to the gym and finding their headphones I stayed for an extra hour and this didn’t happen (til 10 PM). The second would be me taking them to the front desk and the lady keeping it for the person or deciding to keep it for herself (which is something she’s done before). The third would be some random person finding them keeping it or taking it to the desk, and keep in mind a lot of the people here are very trashy. The fourth option and the one I went with was letting my girlfriend take them.

Now the reason why I did that was because if I left them there they would have a 80% chance of being stolen, and if I took them to the front desk they would of had a 100% chance of being stolen. So I figure if someone was going to steal them it should be someone who I like. I know that’s some pretty messed up reasoning. I couldn’t keep them for myself because I wouldn’t be able to sleep, literally. However, now that I let my girlfriend take them I still feel just as guilty, AITA?

TLDR; my girlfriend and I were lifting and found some beats. I didn’t keep them because I would feel guilty so I let her take them instead and I feel just as bad."		1	0
c5zccq	2019-06-27 01:44:39	chelsaratops	AITA for not wanting anyone from my brothers gf’s house in my house? Including him?	"Main because idgaf. 

Some backstory that is pertinent to the situation: my brother lived on his own for several years with some roommates. They all decided to get a dog a couple years ago. Last year the roommates all decided to part ways. My brother kept the dog but struggled to find a new place he could afford. 

He asks to stay with me for a “little while” while he saves up some money and finds a new place. I reluctantly agreed but said only for a few months, as I had just found out I was pregnant and wanted him gone when we had to start getting the house ready for the baby. 

Six months later (December of this past year) I basically had to kick him out. It was the end of the agreed upon time and I was now VERY pregnant and needed to spend time with my husband getting our home ready for our baby. He ends up going to stay with our grandma. No dogs allowed. 

Fast forward to now, his dog is still here. Baby’s here. It’s time for our yearly family vacation and my brother needs to find someone to watch his dog. The first time I asked him to come dog sit both of our dogs he brushed me off and said he might have plans....ok whatever I thought.  

He came around and said he’d do it. But then I figured out just how much time he spends over his girlfriend’s house. She has 2 kids and none of them (including her) are vaccinated. Last week he told me he basically spends all his free time there and just sleeps at my grandmas. I think to myself HELL no he’s not having her over here while we’re gone. 

We decide to take our dog on the vacation and tell him to make other plans with his dog. He said ok he’ll take her to gf’s. 

Good deal, everything’s sorted right? Wrong. 

Gf’s dog now has fleas. Understandably that’s not going to work out. I don’t want him bringing fleas in my house on top of the risk to my baby, so I told him I don’t want ANYONE from her house at mine. Including him if he’s gonna spend majority of his time there. (I should mention I don’t mean ever, I just mean directly after he’s been over there, he doesn’t come to my house much anyways). 

I should also mention that my mom had plans to come take the dog (she lives out of state) since he has no solid plans to move back out for a couple YEARS and he told her no. She’s paid vet bills for her and I frequently have to front money for the dogs food and only get paid back some of the time. She’s a very good dog and I love her, so this is absolutely nothing on her. He just won’t respect my wishes for my house and fuck off from his gf’s house for one week to watch his own dog...

So am I the asshole for telling him to stay away from my house with his girlfriend’s (potential) germs and now fleas? I know I’m putting him in a bind but I honestly don’t care.

c5zbck	2019-06-27 01:42:05	Blah_blah210	AITA for reporting a coworker for time card fraud?	So I work at a small family owned doctors office in an admin position. We fill out our own time sheets, and it’s solely the honor system. Our manager is super trusting and mostly hands off. So the other day my coworker got to work almost an hour late which is fine, but I just happened to see her time sheet today (it’s the one right under mine in the stack) and she wrote that only got to work 15 min late...now this is quite a difference and I’ve been debating reporting it to my manager. I spoke to another coworker about it, and this is not even the first time she’s done it. What’s more annoying is she consistently takes longer breaks and lunches than we are actually allowed but always puts the ‘allowed’ time on her time sheet. Now if we worked for a huge corporation or hospital I wouldn’t even bat an eye bc whatever stick it to the man, but we don’t, it’s a really small office and if one person is slacking (or taking long lunches/breaks or misreporting their hours) it greatly affects all of us. We aren’t usually allowed overtime so if she lies about working that extra time, another day she has to leave early. My manger is super chill so I don’t think she would get fired or anything super serious but still not sure what to do!	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm about a year away from graduating, my wife is still trying to decide what she wants to get her degree in. We both work but because of the high cost of my schooling (Masters program) we have had to take out loans to cover what we can't out of pocket. Because of my high class load she works more and makes more money than I do. 

My wife can't decide what she wants graduate in, and as a result has failed a lot of classes because she has lost interest in the subject halfway through a semester. It's really frustrating to me to go into more debt just to have her fail classes because of loss of interest. Or to pay for another semester of random classes that won't help her get a degree.

I told her I was reluctant because of money issues and the hassle of putting the pool up and maintaining it. To urge me to do it, she assured me that she would do all the maintenance for the pool including assembling it. We work different schedules, I have an 8-5, 5 days a week job as well as a 3 hour internship each week. She works as well but does 12 hour shifts on  3-4 nights a week.Trying to work, take care of my home life, and maintain a social life has been pretty draining so I’ve been super exhausted. After work I usually take a nap. Each day she has asked me to help. She asked me to buy 20 bags of 50lb sand to level the pool and expected me to pick it up in my little Chevy Spark. When I told her they wouldn’t fit she was exasperated. There is a creek behind us so she has been digging up dirt from the there to level the pool, as this requires a lot of work she has been making comments about how hard it is for her to do and has asked me (and even had my mom guilt me into it) to help. Usually she asks around 8pm so it’s much to late to get anything done.
I offered to help drain the pool (it’s not level enough to hold water) and help pay for sand. I went down to help drain the pool and after realizing how long it would take and how dark it was getting, I suggested we put it on hold. She got angry and told me to go back to my house and that she would do it herself like always.

AITA for not helping? I understand the work is hard but I made full disclosure that I didn’t have the time for assembly and maintenance."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c5z6oo	2019-06-27 01:29:48	NotFunThings	AITA for being mad/sad/jealous because my best friend is only talking about her new friends?	"I'm a HS student. My best friend just went to a really cool camp. She met some (evidently) pretty cool people down there, but since she has come back, the camp and her new friends is quite literally about 1/2 of what she will talk about. I've tried gently changing the subject before, but it eventually comes back to her new friends. 

It's like I feel replaced sort of, like she kinda disregards me now if that makes sense. She is sending me pictures off of their insta accounts (I didnt ask for them), pictures of them at camp together, it has been well over a week since so it's just a bit...well, annoying. She is a really cool person and is just excited, but when she goes on talking about them I get aggravated, and unfortunately a little mad, too, as that is most of what she talks about now, and I feel kinda sad that I've ""been replaced"". Obviously there is no ignoring that I am jealous as well. I haven't said anything to her so far and don't know if I will. 

TL;DR: Best friend got some new friends, I'm feeling replaced and aggravated/sad that I am. She keeps talking about them and it's just annoying hearing about them over and over again."	No A-holes here	0	0

c5z5u1	2019-06-27 01:27:22	not_thedrink	AITA for not wanting to reconcile with my cousin?	"She's 32 and I'm 29. We had a falling out six months ago because she was talking shit about one of our other cousins for no reason and I called her out on it. (Edit) The cousin she was talking shit about has had to deal with a lot of pain in her life but she's made up for her sketchy teenage years and is an amazing mom to her kids. Cousin 1's comments were about how Cousin 2 is an awful person/mother, which is so far from the truth that I saw red. 

I also called her out on calling her mom ""crazy"". Her mother is bi-polar and struggling with it, she has obvious self-esteem issues surrounding the fact that she's ""crazy"" and ""a burden"" so my annoyance isn't coming from nowhere. My cousin called me an SJW and accused me of acting holier-than-thou, she even screamed at me to get off my high horse when I (sincerely) apologized for stepping a bit out of line re: how she interacts with her mother. 

If I'm being honest, part of why I exploded on her was that she's been a mean girl all her life and she gets away with it because no one bothers to correct her. Due to various life-things, we both grew up and lived with our childless aunt. We were pretty much sisters, except the kind of sisters where one is pretty and mean and the other is a dowdy nerd (ahem, me.) My aunt loves us both, we're pretty much her only family now, however, my cousin hasn't changed much. Her mean girl attitude has carried her through life and I'm tired of dealing with her negativity.

Anyway, all that background aside, it's been a while since our falling out and I don't miss her one bit. It took cutting her out to realize she didn't really add anything of value to my life; our interactions had been all about her, her, her but I feel a bit guilty on behalf of her mother and our aunt who have lost their sense of family because she and I no longer speak.

I don't think I'm TA for cutting her out, but I'm worried that I am for not cultivating a more peaceful solution to the whole thing, seeing as I'm the only one with the emotional competency to smooth things over.

TL;DR I cut my toxic cousin out of my life but our family is the one reaping the fall out. I'm more than happy with this result. Should I bother reaching out or just keep on keeping on?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

The only issue is after you eat (around 4-5 depending on when you get there) you are sitting outside on the golf course until they start the fireworks at 9:00. I have skin that burns easy, and sitting in the sun for hours is just not comfortable, so I bought a umbrella tent and plan to bring it to the event this year. I plan to take it down when the sun is down and before they start the fireworks as to not disrupt anyone’s view, would I be an asshole for bringing a tent to hide myself from the sun until nighttime.

Incase you are wondering, I do wear sunscreen (SPF 100 to be exact), the sun always finds a way to burn me, or I forget to reapply it, resulting in a sunburn anyways.

Edit: it is a crowded event (parking lot is usually almost completely full) and I have never seen anyone else bring a tent or umbrella, so I want to make sure I’m not gonna be an asshole bringing one.

c5z3gr	2019-06-27 01:20:45	JamalHarrison	AITA for letting my sisters dog eat all the hot dogs?	"So my sister got a golden doodle puppy a few months ago who has consistently been my responsibility. I work at night being that I’m 20 and waiting tables is decent money, while my mom dad and sister all work during the day (she’s 22 if that matters). She got the dog because she has “bad anxiety” and is lonely with no boyfriend. She has never had one before and all her friends are off getting engaged and taking trips with their significant others, and my parents solution was to get her a dog. We have 2 other dogs, a beagle terrier and shitzu yorkie, so needless to say this golden doodle is a lot to handle compared to them. I do my best with keeping an eye on her, but she gets into anything and everything and we have essentially locked down most of the house. The dog gets no training and when I point that out my parents and sister tell me to train her. My response is always “this is not my dog and I did not want this dog.”  

Today my mom decides to make hot dogs and left them all on top of the stove. I was outside at the time and she came out eating one and told me they were inside if I wanted them. After about 15 minutes of us both sitting outside, I go in to eat. I ate 2 hot dogs like normal, and went upstairs into my room. My mom gives me “the scream” that I can hear through my headset. You know, that yell where you know your parents are upset. My mom comes up the steps and opens my door and proceeds to yell at me because the dog ate all the hot dogs that I left on the stove. I feel the need to stress I am leaving no comments out. Not once did I get any comment anything close to “put them away when you’re done.” I also feel the need to point out this dog has only pulled food off the counter a few times before and most of her misbehaviors are eating shoes and other clothing items. 

After I said to her “I don’t know what to tell you” she turned around and slammed the door and left. Am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5z1mf	2019-06-27 01:15:37	DisabledKitty	AITA for not wanting to clean?	"Tldr at bottom.
Half vent, half aita

Back story.
I live in a share house with 4 other people. 2 of which are kind of in a relationship(a pretty toxic controlling one). 1 who is a long time friend and another who works full time.
I have never really had issues with anyone until recently.
The house we are living in is rather a big house with 2 living rooms. But daid couple never leave their room(even though they have sperate rooms they basically live in one of them, which is really creepy because of age difference and the guy is starting to basically control girls life). I spend most od my time in living room or my craft area, so I dont see them much. 

Drama.
So it seems that the couple don't clean....like much if any at all. I've spoken to all housemates and we all agree that I seem to be doing the most cleaning(I do make a bit more mess with crafting and take responsibility for that). But recently I have been scrubbing the kitchen and bathroom nearly weekly. I vaccum the hair(people are just dropping hair everywhere and Im bald so its not me). Bathroom, kitchen and living rooms always have a layer of hair. Keep in mind this is also not my long time friend as he has dyed hair of a torally different colour. 
Last night I had a yelling fit(not a fight just a very loud discussion) on how people arent cleaning. The vouple seem to think that using water and paper towel, or a bench cleaner and paper towel is how tou clean a stove top that has oil and food on it. The back splash was also covered in oil. Consinder there are only 2 peoppe in the house that use lots of oil when cooking and neither of them clean. I have decided that I am no longer cleaning.
Apprently the male in this couple vaccumed last week, but I was home all of last week besides 1 day when I was out. I did not see him vaccum at all, and the house was a mess till I cleaned it. So well done on him for lieing about cleaning.

I will still vaccum because I am grossed out by hair. But as the couple have this mentality of ""we do owe share"" but only if they make a mess first, I wont be doing genrally cleaning anymore.

I have tested this before, I didnt vaccum for a month and only one other housemate took it upon themselves to do so(long time friend). Noone cleans the bathroom with actually  cleaner so I stopped cleaning that awhile ago and the amount of scum and hair just built up so quickly it was evident noone else was cleaning. The couple even admitted to not cleaning certain things because they don't use them. But like others dont use them and we all still clean.


TLDR: AITA for not cleaning a house when housemates refuse to clean.

Ps. Even the landlord has said I do the most cleaning.

EDIT 1: this is not the first time we (as a household) have had issue of the house not being cleaned. We all previously blammed a sexist housemate(who thoughy it was womens job to clean) for all the mess. And while yes he never cleaned his dishes or much anything. It seems he is not to blame since he was kicked out.

EDIT 2: the cleaning has been discussed preivously and it always ends up in ""I clean my mess"" ""I will help next time"" "" sure I can help"" ""I did that last time"" when most of the time I or friend has asked for help ut doesn't get done.

EDIT 3: for clarification as to why I know the cleaning isn't getting done. I have leg issues and was bedridden for nearly a month. I was stuck on the couch throughout this time and only saw 1 housemate vaccum/dust. It was my friend long time friend."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5z0ol	2019-06-27 01:12:47	sylhorrorshow	AITA for feeling upset to fork out $400 to cancel my vacation due to boyfriend's family member's illness?	"my boyfriend and I had a 6-day vacation planned in advanced - flight, accommodation, tours, all booked in advance. the vacation was planned because he was invited to a friend's wedding overseas, so we planned a trip around it and wanted to take the chance for a vacation too. 

a week before the trip, his grandfather is hospitalised due to complications from existing conditions and it seems to be getting worse. during this time, I'm emotionally supportive and I visit him together w my bf.

3 days before the trip, he calls to tell me that his grandfather is in a bad condition, and that his auntie (matriarch of the family) has started asking all their overseas relatives to return to the country and prepare for the worst. he asks if we should cancel our vacation, and i readily agree (albeit a little disappointed) with no hesitation as I understand that he's very close to his grandfather. I'm also alright with the cancellation as we had bought insurance and cancellation plans.

2 days before the trip, after I had already submitted the trip cancellations for all our bookings, I'm informed by our insurance policy that it does not cover cancellations caused by serious illnesses in non-immediate members of the family, i.e. the grandfather does not count as an immediate family member, hence we cannot claim for insurance. this would mean we would lose about $400 worth of tickets and bookings. we're both in our 2nd year of our careers and trying to save up to get a house, and losing $400 is quite a large sum for us.

I feel bad because I'm feeling upset at losing the $400. I know that the trip cancellation is unavoidable, but at the same time I'm not happy that I have to lose the money for someone that insurance policies do not consider an immediate family member. the reason we even planned this trip was also to attend my bf's friend's wedding, whom I do not know and have not met, so it's a huge bummer for me that not only did I have to lose the money spent on someone I did not know, I also lose my chance at a long-awaited vacation.

AITA for feeling upset that we're losing this money? WIBTA if I ask my bf whether him or his family can pay for our losses? After all, it's his relative.

c5z06q	2019-06-27 01:11:25	KayNPaws	AITA for being mad at my parents when they don’t reward me?	"To start this out; no I am not a 5th grader and do not expect gold stickers every time I use the restroom obviously. I am 22 and live with my parents still. I do not pay rent but do try my best to pick up and clean around the house and make dinners from time to time. 

Here is the hook, I deal with sever anxiety and depression and have most of my life. Due to this I have a hard time motivating myself to do anything. I also work at a job which requires human interaction and it mental wears me out every day. Those who suffer with these illnesses may get where I’m going. 

One thing we Butt heads a lot on is my room. I won’t lie, it’s pretty cluttered and I struggle to keep it clean but I have explained to them many times that I can’t force myself to clean it. They expect me to keep it clean, swept, and looking nice. Understandable. A big way I find that helps motivate me is to do a little at a time. When I do end up finishing a part I feel very excited. I want to show them and see their faces when they see it. 

Here is what happens instead. They come in, look at it and nod their heads before telling me the 100 other things wrong in the room. The dusting, the floor, the bed. 
I’ve explained to them before I have a hard time to keep motivated and would appreciate if they could show me some for of approval and be happy I did that part instead of telling me what I didn’t do. They ignore me basically when I say this. I become very upset and no longer have motivation to do anything. 

So AITA for being mad that my parents, who allow me to live rent free at their house, won’t help me with this mental illness after explaining to them what they can do to help me?
Feel free to ask any questions below! Thank you again!! 😅

Edit; read a few comments and want to clear something up real fast; it’s not an every thing I do I want a reward type thing, though I see I made it seem like that. I meant as I take a step forward and they tear me back down. Just would like them to show positivity.

now some added info here. 
I just came out as gay 4 months ago and it was a pretty bad experience, I'm still struggling with being gay and she knows this. 

the part she wants me to play is a overly gay guy, I mean short shorts and crop top with a high pitched voice kinda gay. I've never meet a gay guy like that, and I assume she is doing it because it's somewhat common in movies/TV shows. 
she wants her first film to be a gay romance. 
I find it incredibly insensitive to make a gay guy act like that and so I've refused to play the part. I'm also not comfortable in the outfits I have to wear for the part as they expose my body in a way i hate.

She knows I dislike it and her family knows that I'm not religious. Yet they continue to expect that I go. It's not too big of a deal, it's an hour of my time and it's something little I can show them that I care about them. 

We actually live closer to my family but we never see them. Well, I see them. She always has an excuse not. 

It's the women's world cup right now and we're soccer fans. Sure it's not as big a deal as religion, but it's something my family is into. 

I asked if she wanted to go watch the group stage games with the family, which she said no. Not a big deal because it's just group stage and she doesn't care for soccer. 

Tonight I asked if she'd go see the next match with us. She said no. So I asked if she would at least go with me to see the finals with my family. She rolled her eyes said ""eh I don't think so""

I end up saying that I no longer want to go to church then. Then we get into a big fight. The fight wasn't just about the soccer game or church. It became about her not wanting to give my family the time of day.

She said, and I am paraphrasing because she was very angry , "" Get here now, we are getting kicked out !"" But more angrier. Wtf? It suddenly set in, this lady is a foster caretaker most likely or a terrible babysitter. She is in charge of both children. She screams at both children likes it their fault. My thought was; OMG she is going to brutalize those children verbally ,at least... as she had already begun. They are going to have no idea the adult is the problem. That yes, kids hit each other but supervision stops things from getting violent! I feel just broken for those two boys. I wish I had thought quicker and got a picture of her locence plate. Stupid me. My friend who I was having lunch looked at me and said ""You should mind your own business"" Got up and walked out of the restaurant. He basically implied that I am an asshole for saying something. My only reply to him was "" We as a people demand that no human gets hit"" It kind of fucked me up because I was not the only adult in the playroom. There were at least 10. No one said anything during the whole event. They just stared. So now I am confused, do people think I am an asshole for getting involved?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5yuky	2019-06-27 00:56:24		AITA for not wanting to go to my father's funeral?	"Tl;dr at the bottom

So, my (19M) father (57M) died this week. He and I don't have any sort of relationship other than blood. He was a raging alcoholic who beat me on several occasions in my early childhood (when i was around 10-14 years old). The beatings weren't the sort of ""come here, i'm feeling like beating you"" but they were more of in the way of ""you did something wrong again, you little shit"". Now, i have several siblings, none of whom receieved any sort of abuse for him. 

As i have said, he was an alcoholic. This got worse as the years went on and i hated him more and more growing up because he would blame all of the bad stuff in his life on me, because i was the only one of his kids who ""didn't behave like the normal ones"". Our relationship deteriorated over time for obvious reasons (if there ever was one) and i firmly decided at 13-14 that i would just in general pretend that he wasn't there. 

At around the same time, he and my mom got separated (officialy divorced about a year ago) which i was thrilled about. On the other hand, most of my family took his side. Now, there's a lot of us in my family and in my community there was a sense of pride in having a big, wonderful, happy family, at least to the outside world. 

He helped my uncles and grandparents when they had money problems, and generally the only reason for them to like him, despite his constant drinking and drunk arguing with everybody, was that he was a source of money. He was like a ""source"" for them to get stuff. Since his job paid well, he had a lot of different work contacts which he used to get favors for my family. 

I haven't talked to him for almost five years now. It was my decision to cease all contact, and my family resented me for it, saying that we should have a relationshio and that i should respect because ""even if he did that stuff to you, he's your father and you should respect that"", and shaling it up to bei g a teenage rebel. Now that he's dead, they're asking me to come to the funeral by way of gulit-tripping me. One of the uncles sent me a message saying ""sometimes adults need to put things behind them"". They never respected my decision, only some of my brothers have accepted it very recently, as it was easier to just let it go, with one of them saying to me that it would make them happy if i showed up for the funeral. 

AITA for not wanting to go to the funeral?

Tl:dr - my father died, i don't want to go to his funeral. Whole of the other family this i should, half of them because ""it would please them"" and half of them because ""it would make me ffeel bad in the future"""	Not the A-hole	1	0
c5ytja	2019-06-27 00:53:32	backxbeforexdawn	AITA for clogging the toilet?	"Okay so funny title but not so funny scenario (or maybe it will be in hindsight). 

I’m a woman who has some bathroom troubles that is mostly regulated by medication. Every now and then I still manage to accidentally clog the toilet, which I’ve always been able to easily fix on my own without issue. 

Today...was different. 

My husband and I recently moved into a one-bathroom apartment and we are now getting used to the perils of sharing a toilet. 

Earlier tonight, I clogged it. 

I tried to fix it as normal, but it wasn’t working. 10 minutes or so went by and still no luck. I was basically panicking. 

I’m a little squeamish and grew up in a household where bathroom stuff wasn’t supposed to be talked about, so asking for help in this situation was WAY outside my comfort zone. 

Eventually after maybe 15 minutes, my husband asked if I was okay. I said I clogged the toilet and just needed a minute to fix it. He offered to help and I refused nervously. I went back to what I was doing and he WALKED IN ON ME!

He didn’t knock or ask if it was okay to enter, he just walked right in. Since it’s just the two of us, I’ve never felt the need to lock the door — I just close it. 

It shocked me and I told him to get out, which he did. But then he yelled at me from the other side of the door that he needed to come in and fix it so he could pee. I said I just needed a minute and I could do it myself. He stood outside for a few more minutes yelling at me and getting angry. 

Eventually he walked away and I was able to fix it after like 30 more seconds. I left the bathroom and went back to my room (we have different bedrooms because of sleep issues). I was really thrown off and hurt so I closed the door (which is unusual for me) and locked it. 

I just needed space. 

He immediately comes storming over and asks if it’s okay to use the bathroom now — I say yes. 

And then he TRIES TO COME IN AGAIN without asking. He rattles the door and realizes it’s locked and then keeps trying to open it. For a second I honestly thought he was going to try and break down the door. 

I think he was really about to. But he seemed to get control of himself and just yelled that I need to “grow up” and stormed off. 

I don’t necessarily disagree that I maybe need to grow up. I realize that I am overly anxious about this type of thing and that I probably can trust my husband to help in these situations. 

But this has never really happened before and I was panicking and very anxious (I struggle with anxiety, which he knows about). 

AITA? Or should he have been more sensitive?

I’m most concerned that he thought it was okay (twice) to come through a closed door without asking when I clearly was expecting privacy. But maybe I am overreacting and there doesn’t need to be privacy between spouses?

TLDR: husband walked in on me without asking while I was in the bathroom and I may or may not be overreacting."	Asshole	0	0

Before the panelbeaters to the left of my workshop closed and sold off, there were several people a day parking lengthways across my drive. My business is a relatively unique mechanical trade, so I get all the customers in the whole region. My customers could not drive down into my workshop or even park outside as the driveway was constantly blocked by people parking to go into the panelbeaters.

After several people being told not to park across my drive, one man in particular who had parked there (that I had asked him not to do this, and he responded in a snarky tone and left) came back after a few days and did so again. Not only that, but he was illegally parked on the footpath aswell. I guess I just snapped, and while he was next door at the panelbeaters I went over and let the air out of all four tyres. He came back, came into my workshop and asked me if I did it. I responded yes, he parked in my driveway after I had politely asked him not to. He was absolutely livid, went across to the Mechanic (directly across the road) had his tyres inflated, and NEVER came back again.

At first I thought I was within my right to do so as he was parked along my driveway, on my property. But looking back I'm not sure if what I did was right.  AITA?

This sounds terrible but I've never had a positive experience when working closely with black women (in the workplace or at school). Each time it happens I've encountered highly abrasive, aggressive, and loud personalities, and unpleasant attitudes that remind me deeply of my childhood abuser. I'm well aware that this personality type does not apply to everyone and am absolutely capable of being respectful to everyone I meet regardless of race. I'm just being honest that this has been my experience. It intimidates me and makes me uncomfortable. So when I met my new therapist today and took in her posture, expressions, mannerisms, and language, my heart sank a little and all I could think was, ""We're just not going to connect."" 
My husband thinks I'm being racist which makes me feel horrible. I realize this is not a rational or healthy way of thinking and that it's definitely a ME problem, not a them problem. However, I also feel like these sessions are about MY comfort and healing, and that it's not the time or place to address those issues, at least not yet. I'd like to think I'm not a racist. There's not a bone in my body that would ever think a black person less capable or worthy of a job like this.

"Background: I am 23 years old, male, just recently moved into my parents house until August, when I'll be moving away to go to college. I don't have a job this summer, as I was supposed to be in basic training but my ship date got canceled and so I had nothing to do this summer. I am from the US. I have lived on my own for 2 years prior to this. 

&#x200B;

I have always wanted to travel abroad, so since I didn't have anything to do this summer, I decided to book a trip to Thailand, and spend about a month there. I am fully paying for the trip myself with absolutely no help from my parents. I am leaving this week, and ever since I told my father I was going, he has essentially disowned me. He is absolutely against me traveling abroad anywhere, especially since I'll be on my own. He continually yells at me and tells me I am disrespecting him since he doesn't want me to go and yet I am going anyway. He is trying to emotionally manipulate me into not going by telling me that he wants to put a bullet into his head and that his stress might kill him while I'm gone. He obviously doesn't mean it, but its startling to me as he has never acted this way before and has been a great father to me my whole life. He says that he can't protect me while I'm over there and I keep trying to tell him that I am 23 years old, that he can't protect me anymore and if he was a good father, he would want me to grow as a person instead of trying to keep me locked in a metaphorical cage where nothing can happen to me. He has told me that he is done with me, and that I am not a good son. I have tried to show him where I'm going to be staying and what I'll be doing to try to ease his mind but he refuses to listen or understand why I want to go. In his defense, I did kind of wait until the last minute to tell him about it, but in my eyes, I'm at the point in my life where I don't need to get his permission to do anything.

c5ym8l	2019-06-27 00:33:26		AITA for wanting our freeloading adult son to mow our yard once a week when he works all week mowing for other people?	"I already posted my story about my husband’s fall and if I was the TA in how I handled the whole thing (thanks for that feedback!), but this other situation is the \*real\* reason I was initially searching for an online place to ask if I am the asshole. So here goes.

  
Our adult son (31) has lived with us for over 2 years since his divorce and when he lost his job. His has a new job which is enough to pay his own bills (car payment, phone, daycare for his daughter, etc) but is not enough to pay us rent or help with utilities and groceries. Or to live on his own, obviously.  But, I digress; that topic is another post for another day. 

  
His new job is in landscaping, so the ONLY thing we asked him to do when he moved in is to mow our lawn in the summer since we were paying someone to do it before he moved in. He works 6 days a week in the summer, so this means he has to do it on his only day off. It takes 30 minutes to do both yards, 45 if he weed eats, too. 

  
It’s a pretty good deal for him! He doesn’t have to pay anything to live here, and doesn’t have to do anything else around the house except his own laundry (I would \*like\* him to do more around the house, but that’s not going to happen) so all in all it’s a sweet deal for him. Yet, he doesn’t do it often enough. He does the front every two weeks to barely keep the HOA happy, but doesn’t do the backyard every time. So, it often goes a month without. And every two weeks for the front is really not often enough for my taste. The service we used to use mowed every week, or 9-10 days at the most.   


This is the third summer in a row that our son has been here, and I am tired of asking him to mow every time it looks to me like it needs it. He gets annoyed when I ask and tells me I am being too picky and that the HOA isn’t going to cite us if it’s just a little scraggly. I told him that it’s not just about the HOA. I like a nicely manicured lawn and if he won’t do it as often as \*I\* like, then I will have to pay someone again. I realize that is my choice if I want it done more often, but...

  
...AITA for wanting and expecting \*him\* to do it as often as \*I\* want since he lives here 100% free, even though I know that would mean every week on his one day off?

  
Two other bits of info: We can afford to pay someone to do it. Also, He shares equal custody of his 7 year old daughter so she is here every other week. We (well, really, I) babysit for two hours every night the weeks she is here while he goes to his NA meetings (another post for another day), and also on the two Saturday’s she is here, while he works. I don’t mind because she is a delight and well behaved and we are close. But I really would rather be a visited grandma than be a weekly caregiver grandma. (ummm, another post for another day. Sheesh, I have a lot of AITA moments in my life; maybe I really am the asshole in my family.)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5ykti	2019-06-27 00:30:02	l0lw0lf	AITA for Getting a Cell Phone for Christmas and Telling Them I Didn't Want One?	"A little bit of a backstory: When I was first introduced to a fully functional cell phone to use by me and my brother, it was not high-tech, which means no web surfing, YouTube, or MySpace was done on it. To me, it was just a portable phone and anytime Mother would take it away, I would just shrug it off without giving it a second thought. I was not like most kids when it came to cell phones. On the other hand, I also didn't like wearing jeans. That's how ""different"" I was.

This happened in Junior year of High School in late 2000s.

There was a girl I was interested in and started talking to her. One day I noticed she had a cell phone and I figured I could better my chances by talking to her outside of school if I had cell phone too (I didn't get out of the house much). My birthday was close ( it is in early November) and I casually asked my mother if I could have a cell phone for my birthday and i didn't ask for anything specific, just one that i could make calls on. She tells me maybe. I reply with ""If I can, that would be awesome. If not, then don't worry about it."" My birthday comes around and no cell phone. I simply shrugged my shoulders and continued with my life. After that, my need for a cell phone just vanished.

Fast forward to Christmas morning, I was in the living room with my mother and her boyfriend and I just opened all my presents. A few minutes later, I hear a phone ringing. I merely assumed it was either my mother's or her boyfriend's phone going off so I didn't pay too much attention. Then there was a long series of them telling me that the sound was coming from one of the presents, me saying it is probably a defective toy (the present was labeled for someone else). Long story short: they got me a cell phone as a surprise present, and they were calling it. Me being completely oblivious, still figured it was defective and they should probably return it if they can. Then they reveal they were calling it and it is MY phone because I asked for one. I respond with ""I wanted one for my birthday... and I said forget about it if I didn't get one."" My mother was really confused by this.

In case you all are wondering: I did end up keeping the phone."	Asshole	0	0

I raised my voice, saying "" Why didn't you ask me before dumping my stuff onto the floor?!!!! I had important items in there"". He cried while saying "" mom let me have the box "". My mother came into the area, yelled "" STOP YELLING! I LET HIM HAVE THE STUPID BOX"". I said "" fine, bro you can keep it "". He no longer wanted the box and started crying. I left the area and went to my room, and saw the possessions from the box, spilled onto the ground, crumpled and tattered. Thing is, I didn't yell, I raised my voice for the first time in a long time. I never yell, I have a lot of repressed anger. My mom is being a total hypocrite because she yelled and raged. I am very calm and not quick to anger. My family members are the opposite. I'm supposedly a jerk for making my ( super sensitive) brother cry. This kid is really sensitive and cries when something doesn't go right or if someone slightly raises their voice. My parents baby him.  My parents do nothing but yell at me. And my brother treated my special items like crap and didn't check with me before raiding my room.

c5yit4	2019-06-27 00:24:37	OneShotKronic	AITA for Refusing to do Yardwork?	"Male, 20y/o college student back home for the summer, living with parents. I got a summer job to be totally self-sufficient and save enough away to have spending money when I'm back at school (it's manual labor in a refrigerated warehouse, but it pays well). I also help out with taking care of my younger brothers and yardwork/chores wherever needed on a daily basis. My Dad, the other main party to this story, works as a golf coach at a local college, and is thus out of season and spends less than 5 hours/day working.

On this note, my Dad has taken it upon himself to construct a French drain out back of our house, to solve some flooding issues we've had in one particular area. I have contributed here and there, but it has been 80% his project which he began before I had even come home for the summer. 

Fast forward to yesterday, where the project is basically finished, but there remains a huge pile of dirt that had been excavated at the outset of the project by my father. Roughly 3 feet tall at the peak, and 5-6 feet wide at the base. Since it's been there for a few weeks, the pile has been rained on multiple times and is pretty dense. My Dad tells me that the plan is to shovel all the dirt into a wheelbarrow and dump it in the creek behind our house (really hope that isn't illegal). Anyways, Dad asks me to get started on the pile, to which I oblige. After making about 10 trips to the creek (which takes about 45 minutes of hard work), my Dad comes outside and asks how many loads I've done. He then says to do 10 more and call it a day. However, after 8 trips I'm noticing the dirt is getting harder and harder to dig up, since it's so wet and compact in the middle, so I end up only doing 8. I come inside and tell my Dad that I only did 8, to which he replies that I'm only leaving more for myself later. At which point I realize that I'm likely going to be digging the entire pile up. 

&#x200B;

Jump again to today, where I had just gotten home from \~7hrs of work, and then the gym for an hour or so, and my Dad tells me not to shower, because I'm going to do some more work on **his** pile. Okay. He says to do 10 more again, to which I say sure, and get to work. I decided again to only do 8, hoping that he would end up doing some himself and appreciate how difficult it is. I come inside and my father asks how many trips I did. When I reply, he says ""that wasn't the deal"" and asks me to go back outside and finish. At this point, I'm exhausted for having been physically active for over 8 hours today, and just want to lay down, I'm also not thrilled about having this work thrust upon me without an option, so I basically tell him to fuck off. Nothing intentionally rude or disrespectful, just say that I've had a long day, and don't really feel like working more, while it's not my project to begin with. Dad says I'm lazy, Mom says it's disrespectful and that I should think of all the things they've done for me; which I think is a shitty argument.

While I was at work at big department store the other day, I was sorting through returns with my coworkers who are all similar in age to me (high schoolers), and there was quite a lot of stuff. It was taking longer than normal, but not an outrageous amount of time or anything. Now, we were talking a bit as we sorted, which isn’t really encouraged, but not heavily enforced. My manager came by and he didn’t really say anything, but didn’t really help us either and he just walked wawa. 

We’re starting to get everything put away, when suddenly we’re getting called to the back office one by one. We got reprimanded for talking, which I apologized for, and also for working slowly, to which I said that there was much more work to do than normal, but I’d finish the rest silently. Next he went on a pretty long rant about how we complain too much about customers (I mean it’s retail I figured everyone kinda did that) and told me that I should “mind my own business” and just do my job and leave. I kinda shrugged it off, but later that night he was talking to my older coworkers and they were all laughing while they were working (in a department that normally only gets one person, but there were 3 of them there). 

I got pretty upset, maybe unnecessarily, but i decided that the next day when he said hello to me that I would just smile at him and not really say much. He said that we’re all too sensitive, but I haven’t really said much besides hello to him since. AITA?"		1	0

c5yhsy	2019-06-27 00:21:48		WIBTA if I ask my BFF to make sure I don’t walk down the aisle and pose for photos with one of the groomsmen?	"About 5 years ago I (20f) was at a kickback at my BFFs boyfriends (Mike’s) house . It was a small gathering and I knew everyone there for a few years at this point. 
That night, I got got super cross-faded and wanted to go to sleep. One of Mike’s roommate, Paul said that I could sleep in his bed. Paul and I have shared a bed before and it was fine and nothing sexual has ever happened between us before. 
Paul and I went to his room to go to sleep and I fell asleep super fast. I woke up in the middle of the night to Paul’s hands in my panties, skirt down, sweater up revealing my breast. Because I was so crossfaded/scared I didn’t even move or say anything. 
The next morning when I was able to move again, I ran out of there. That day I later cried to my bff about what happened and she was so pissed at him. I told her that I didn’t want her to tell Mike and I wanted to forget about it. 
I only saw him once after that, and acted like everything was fine. But the more I thought about it, the more upset I got. I blocked him off of Facebook, his number, avoided that house and I haven’t seen him since. 

Paul is going to be a groomsman in the upcoming wedding and I’m really stressing over seeing him again. I really don’t want to walk down the aisle with him after the ceremony and stand next to him in photos. 

WIBTA if i asked my Bff/bride to make sure I don’t have to walk next to him and pose in photos with just with him? 
I feel guilty about asking because I never reported it and if I had maybe I wouldn’t be in this situation."		1	0

c5yg61	2019-06-27 00:17:23		WIBTA for telling the CEO’s son to stay in his own lane?	"Last summer I landed an internship, my supervisor is a higher up who works side by side with the CEO so he has some power. He really liked me so he invited me to come back this summer, and though he doesn’t have much work for me, I can help out other departments and come and go as I please.

Last summer I also became friends with the CEO’s son, Dan, who’s my age. We live close and would carpool. We have mutual friends. He works next to me in the office and (sort of) gets treated like other coworkers.

Standard work hours are 9am-5pm but I’m usually at the office for less bc I work on my own hours and fill a timesheet. Sometimes I come late and just leave when I’m done, maybe 3:30 or 4.

Today I told Dan I’d drive myself as I’d be coming in later. When I came in at 10 am he scolded me for being late. I replied, I’m not late, bc I’m not paid to work 9-5. I’m efficient with my work and honest on my timesheet so I see no issue. He said he’s also paid hourly but comes in at 9 anyway. 

I was done today at 4 and as I packed up he checked his watch and went “wowwww 4! Really?” Another coworker backed me up and yelled “SHE’S PART TIME” and Dan said “Me too but I don’t leave at 4!” 

Frankly Dan knows nothing about my work ethic, job description, and it’s none of his business. It’s my first week and he’s on my ass. Next time he says shit to me I really just want to tell him to stay in his own lane. Idk why he cares (if he has to defend his family’s company?) and I’m also saving the company money by not stretching my work from 9-5 and billing them.

c5ydmz	2019-06-27 00:11:03	hammerhead1011	WIBTAH if I told some “nice guy” to respect my girlfriend when she tells him to stop after she told me to not say anything?	"         For context: my girlfriend and I are both girls and my girlfriend is bi. So early this semester, my girlfriend rode the bus and this “nice guy” always laid his head on her shoulder and tried to hold her hand and stuff. She always tells him to stop and surprise, surprise he won’t. My girlfriend has anxiety issues when it comes to confrontation type of stuff so I decided to just give her a ride to school since I have my license and can drive to school. (For the record, I offered her a ride to school way before I found this out, but she didn’t want to take it because she was scared of me wasting my gas to go get her.) I figured the problem was solved and that he’ll move on and I didn’t have to say anything to him. 
          So forward to now, it’s summer break and one of the local community colleges is having this event for this week and both my girlfriend and this guy signed up for it. So I came to found out that this kid is doing this stuff again and now he’s telling her the typical nice guy stuff. And I honestly don’t care what he says about me. I’m not the type of person to dwell on the stuff people say about me. I only care about the way he invades her personal space when she tells him to stop and that she’s in a relationship. I’m just scared of it escalating and he’s just going to get worse. My girlfriend told me to not say anything because of her anxiety and wanting to not start drama. But I feel like this guy is going to get worse as time goes on and I want to try and put a stop to this guy’s behavior. I want to respect my girlfriend’s wishes but I also want this guy to leave her alone.

c5yde6	2019-06-27 00:10:23	SteakBarker	AITA for expecting my girlfriend to do the dishes?	"I'll preface this with saying that since the start of our relationship, we have agreed everything is 50/50. This mostly just includes bills. I front all the bills and she just pays me back when she has money

&#x200B;

We don't have a dish washer, so all our dishes must be washed by hand. I'm definitely on the cleaner side so when dishes pile up it makes me kind of anxious.

&#x200B;

Normally the dishes have been 50/50 as well. But lately  I've been working 10s/12s (55hr weeks) and not getting home until around 5 most days (Ranges 4-6). We both start 6am. She gets off at 2:30 sharp everyday, and because of traffic she's home around 2:45/3. Also, the last week we've been starting at 4am (She was off at noon, I was at 4/5)

&#x200B;

When I get home she is either watching TV or taking a nap. I tell her it frustrates me she watches TV for 2/3hr before I get home and she doesn't do the dishes. To her credit she'll do them 50% of the time. The other 50% i'll start them and she might help dry. When I work Saturdays she'll sometimes do the laundry for us. Other-times it waits until Sunday. She says I make the dishes disgusting, but I think the dishes are just fine.

c5yccv	2019-06-27 00:07:53	snipeftw	AITA for being upset that my roommates improperly disposed of condoms which my dog then swallowed?	"I’ve lived with these roommates for about two months now. Dane and Cindy are dating and share their own room. 

I have a dog that is just over a year old, she is a small 15 lbs cutie. 

They have their own dog and two cats so it’s not like they don’t understand basic animal care.

Anyways, this evening I took my dog out for a walk. When she started to poop I realized something akin to a rubber glove come out. I was concerned so I took a closer look and realized I was out of poop bags. So it up with my bare fingers only to realize it was two condoms.

I knew they weren’t mine because the only action I get involves a two inch screen a foot in front of my face.

I went back home with a condom in hand. Dane was sitting at the kitchen table. I held the condom up and said “I appreciate you guys using protection, but wanna make sure she can’t get your condom next time?”

I then threw it in the garbage can, washed my hands and stepped out to pick up some groceries. As I was doing these, I was slowly getting more pissed; it’s disgusting, it could’ve cost me a lot of money, and my dog could have been put through a lot of unnecessary suffering because they didn’t have the foresight to dispose of them in a way that would have prevented my dog from getting it. Or even better close the ducking door if no one is in your room.

Anyways, when I got back from groceries I was confronted by Cindy who said “there is a proper way to communicate, how are we supposed to know”

I responded with “well maybe you can close the door if you aren’t home or in your room.”

She then said “I know your mad, but she’s ok so it’s fine”

I then mentioned that she could’ve been really hurt and the vet bill would’ve been expensive, and explained I didn’t get mad at anyone but I was starting to get angry now. She then said it’s not a big deal and I shouldn’t have handled it the way I did. At which point I said I didn’t want to talk about it now because I needed to cool down.

So am I the asshole here?

Edit: also to clarify, my dog doesn’t go into garbage cans, my roommates cats do, they are the ones who knock it over, and then my dog goes to it because it’s all over the ground.

Edit 2: other roommate Sarah just old me that Cindy texted her saying “snipeftws dog ate my condoms from my garbage, they’ve been there since we moved in 5 months ago”. They didn’t change their damn garbage for 5 months...

Final edit: I concede that the way I confronted him made me come across as an asshole whether I intended to or not. But to everyone saying I don’t take care of my dog and that I need to train her better, you are plain wrong. I take excellent care of my dog, and she is well behaved.

Final edit 2: turns out the roommates were mad because I exposed Cindy cheating on Dane."	Asshole	0	0
c5ybef	2019-06-27 00:04:57	socialskills100	AITA for trying to stop drama?	"There was not nearly enough characters in this sub to explain the whole story and I was thinking about uploading it to advice instead. But let’s say short story: am I the asshole for telling two friends they’ve misunderstood each other?

This is purely online friendships and gaming. I’m the only girl. I spoke to two guys, kinda saw them as older brothers. A mature and very supportive one and a bit of a unruly jokester one. One day the jokester says all these nasty things about the supportive one. I get really confused and sad and ask the supportive one if these things are true. It was things like he had a dark side and didn’t wanna play anymore etc. He got equally as confused and sad and refused that it was true. I think I made a mistake here by telling the jokester “why the fuck are you starting unnecessary drama?” Well... from then on I tried to tell them both they were just misunderstanding each other and should just talk. They finally did after days of both complaining to me and shit talking each other. I was right, though. Misunderstanding.

Should I not have asked the supportive one from the beginning? After this the jokester completed unfriended me and called me a “manipulative, drama loving, lying bitch.” Even tried to call me just to cuss me out and tell me I’m a bitch.

Some other things happened too of course. But I never lied, I hate liars. I was trying to stop the drama the entire time. Was I doing the wrong thing? Was I the asshole here?

I feel like this whole thing is stupid and childish but I did lose a friend in the end. I’m just confused"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5yaze	2019-06-27 00:03:42	bamboslambo18	AITA for taking a parking space?	"Today as I was arriving home from work, I found myself in a weird parking situation. 

I live in Seattle—where parking in scarce to begin with— in a neighborhood where most residents street park. There are definitely more residents and cars than there are spaces available, so it makes for a ‘parking wars’ situation. 
Basically, after 3pm— if you see a spot, you take it. 

Another important bit is that in Seattle, you do not need to park in one uniform direction along any street. In other words, on a East/West facing street, not all cars are required to be facing one direction. This means that cars can parallel park from any direction. 

SO—-today as I was driving down my street, I saw there was a girl getting into her car to leave in the same direction I was driving in. Sweet! The next thing I saw was a car kind of waiting—facing the opposite direction. As I turned my signal on, I noticed he made a “WTF” face and gesture at me a couple times, before speeding away. 

My question is...AITA for taking a spot that showed up? Should I have driven away once I realized he’d waited, even though it’s technically public parking?"	Asshole	0	0
c5yalg	2019-06-27 00:02:32	leopoldhendricks	AITA to tell my neighbours to keep their music down in this manner?	"I've just had it. Recently some new people moved into the house next to us (townhouse), they were always quite loud with their music since day 1 but it's alright, everyone has the right to enjoy their home, but eventually it became a night time thing as well. Two nights in a row my partner had to go next door at 2AM to tell them to keep the music down. They seemed reasonable and turned it down both times, and were never rude in person. 

Around 7PM today (just now) they started blasting their music outside on their terrace so loud that I couldn't even hear my own TV with my doors and windows all closed, eventually I snapped and yelled from my side of the terrace to please keep it down and I slammed my door quite hard, I did not swear or anything, just said can you please keep it down a little bit, I had to yell cuz otherwise they wouldn't be able to hear me. They let the song end at the same volume, then finally stopped.

I'm not the confrontational type at all and the previous 2 nights I got my partner to talk to them instead because I hate direct confrontation and when I finally snap it gets ugly. But I've really just had it, we talked to them twice politely and they're still doing it. I get it it's day time and there's no law restricting loud music but I should at the very minimum be able to hear my own damn tv in my own damn house..

c5ya30	2019-06-27 00:01:06	entitled-brat	AITA for using my father?	"Hey people of r/AITA 

My parents had a divorce when i was 8. My dad moved to germany, 2.5 hours drive (i live in the netherlands)
My parents main reason for divorce was because my dad cared more about money than his own kids.
My mother earns minimal wage, cant work often because of back injuries.
My dad makes about 4k a month. (Might help your judgement)


My dad really used to talk bad about my mother, and would insult her and bring us in the fight.
He once locked me up in the basement of his house (there was food and drinks and a pc so not a biggie for 10y/o me back then)
My dad was just a horrible man, but he now he is trying his ""best"" to be more of a father to me again. And i let him because he gives me lots of stuff and money in the process.
Je gave me 2 guitars and drawing classes and he will pay most of my bills for driving school etc. I guess that is his was of showing love???

Anyways i really still wouldnt care if he'd die or whatever he will do with his misserable life. I just cash in his money. I think he deserves it anyway. He tries to buy his way into my life. And i just let him

When people hear about this they just give me a stinky eye, but my dad has done horrible things (not allowed on reddit i assume) so yeah...

c5y8oz	2019-06-26 23:57:28	cecamicio	AITA for being angry at my mom, because she didn't tell me stuff?	"So my parents are going on a trip for the weekend, starting from today, but they only told me (19F) and my sister (15F) yesterday.
Which would be weird, but I don't think I would be this upset if she didn't lie to me. She told me (and my sister, separately) that she had already told us before. She definitely didn't, none of us remember it, and I specifically asked her last week about what she'd be up to this week. She didn't mention this trip. (Neither did my dad, but that's not as weird, he isn't very talkative.) 


Apart from all this they brought our grandmother over to take care of me and my sister. And I think this is the part that actually upsets me, and I can't help but think I'm a little childish for feeling this way, but it feels like she didn't trust us to be alone for a couple of days. 
Which is weird, honestly, I'm 19 years old, I'm more than able to take care of us for a weekend. The only reason I could think of is that they might have been afraid that my sister would invite her friends over and throw a party (even though she's 15, she goes out to drink regularly and it got out, while I'm the goody-two-shoes), but that's no reason not to confide in me. 


So basically I'm upset because she didn't tell me about the trip and then stated that she did, no matter what the reason was. And this, I think, qualifies as lying. Which is extremely hurtful from her, because I never would have thought she would be capable of doing to me. (She has a sneaky way of not telling the whole truth sometimes, but she hates lying.) But I also think I might be overreacting, what do you think, AITA for being angry at her over this?

Edit: I forgot to mention that it's tiring for my grandma to come over to our house, so her presence here seems a little uncalled for. I do like her and wouldn't have a problem with her otherwise, I just feel like they should have told us."	No A-holes here	0	0

c5y7e8	2019-06-26 23:54:06		AITA for getting for due to several reasons?	"Yesterday morning I was fired from my job as a summer writing intern for a university news service. We mostly report on science and engineering news. 

* Last week my boss emailed me instructions I found confusing I was working on. He told me to revise one of my current drafts before starting a new story or contacting new people. I emailed him that he told me to contact a professor as part of revising the draft, so I was confused what I should do. I even told him that starting new stories wouldn't interfere with revising current ones, but I would follow his instructions anyway. My boss characterized this as ""pushback"" showing defiance or disobedience. I was even more confused because I never said I would disobey him. When I brought up the email exchange to show I wasn't disobeying orders (but, rather, showing that I was confused), he said that my response to him was only making things worse and called me a ""terrible employee."" During this entire time, I never got emotional, showed anger, acted out of frustration, or anything that would seem threatening or unprofessional. I remained calm, diplomatic, and level-headed.

* On the second day of work, I skipped work because I was sick, but I didn't call in. I was too sick to even reach my phone and tell my boss. After this happened, I apologized and told him I'd keep in touch on missing work or coming in late.

* He told me that I've been working for four weeks and haven't finished a single story yet. But, in saying this, completely ignored two stories that I had finished as well as two more that were still being revised (which averages to one story a week, which is in line with the goal to produce 6-10 stories over the course of 10 weeks). Besides my boss never gave me a deadline on anything. He also ignored several side projects that took me several days that were essential to my reporting. Also, during these first few weeks, I was still learning the ropes of things during the first few weeks, so it's natural that my first stories would need a lot of revision.

* When I was interviewing a data science undergraduate student about her work, I mentioned a few things she found rude and discomforting. I told her there were things about data science that were ""trendy"" and in some ways ""myopic"" as these data science initiatives are ascribing to current fads. But these were only a few sentences, and I apologized after she emailed me telling me those sentences was rude and discomforting. I was also saying many nice things about data science and the university's efforts. She complained to my boss.

When my boss put these reasons in front of me during a one-on-one conversation in his office, he did say that I could continue working for a week. But I was so frustrated that I got up, took all my belongings, and left before they even told me to leave. I think that really sent a message to the entire office that I didn't want to work with them anymore."	Asshole	0	0
c5y77t	2019-06-26 23:53:37	Hopeful_Tell	WIBTA for adopting a cat if my siblings said no?	"My brother and I (21 and twins) inherited the house in April (parents dead). I would love to give an elderly cat or 2 a new home. I have a steady income, and enough money to live off for years. My brother and I are the legal owners of the house after we buy out an estranged brother's share. My half-brother lives here as well, but just pays utilities. **TL;DR at the bottom.**

My half-brother would be fine with something that stays in a cage at all times, and my brother agrees. My brother's issue with cats is that they get hair everywhere, which is true, but I would be the only one taking care of it and cleaning after it. I tend to be a little Danny Tanner about cleaning. If cats brush his cheek, he gets a rash there, but that is all. And I would definitely train the cat to leave him alone and pay for any medication, along with rehoming if necessary.

Our lawyer said that since this is my house, too, I can just get a cat without their permission, but my half-brother threatens to move out if he does not have his way, like when I asked him to pay a cheap rent since my brother does not want to work. Additionally, my brother tends to be controlling to the point of not even letting me pour my own chips because he thinks my germs will contaminate them.

WIBTA if I got a cat behind their backs?

TL;DR: My brothers will not let me have a cat. My brother does not want hair everywhere, and he gets a rash on his cheek if one touches him there. I would train it to leave him alone, stay out of certain rooms, and pay for my brother's medication, along with rehoming if his allergy gets worse.

c5y6wu	2019-06-26 23:52:47	throwaway_c_53	AITA for not wanting to tell my family anything?	"I love my family but they upset me quite a bit when it comes to money.  My family is not badly off but I'm one of the first in my family to complete college.  I've recently been accepted to a position where I make 80k a year which is significantly better than most of my family makes. I'm very grateful for this but my extended family seems to believe that I am the savior of our line.  My grandfather passed a joke not even a week after I was hired about buying him a new SUV since theirs is 10 years old.  I know it's a joke but it made me uncomfortable.  My grandmother similarly just mentioned me taking care of them when they need to find a retirement home.  These are not responsibilities that I planned to avoid but it upsets me how casually they seem to discuss them, and how they are only mentioning them now that my college degree has paid off and I have a job.  My grandmother didn't even ask, just expected me to lay down thousands of dollars to take care of her.

I'm not trying to be ungrateful but I paid my own way through college and am still handling the debt, not a cent from my grandparents.  They are living in a 300,000$ house and are still working, I can only assume that their financial decisions led to them having to do that.  They have been nice and supportive as grandparents but I would not consider myself very close to them, we maybe talk a couple times a month when I am not living at home.  I cannot think of a single time where they have been exceedingly supportive financially, the most they have ever given me is 50$ on a birthday (and only that a couple times) and they cook dinners for me when I visit them.  I am not complaining about this but these are just thoughts I've had since they've talked to me about this money.  

I try to think of this from their perspective, they're growing old and are scared of being left somewhere terrible but I guess I'm scared of losing everything I've worked so hard for.  My mother had to raise me alone and I know she is not close to them as she feels that they let her down a lot financially as I was growing up.  At a recent family gathering I bought my cousin a 30$ gift and my grandfather yelled ""he's making engineer money now, don't worry about him"".  They don't even seem proud of what I'm doing or where I'm working, just the pay check.  It honestly makes me wish that I had never told my family about the new job and how much I earned.  I just remembered, my grandma actually googled how much a person in my position makes and got a highly overinflated number and told my entire family so I had to correct them.  Before that I hadn't mentioned it.  I don't want to let this new job twist my mind so I'm looking for hopefully unbiased advice. I'd like to add that I plan on taking care of my mother to the fullest extreme.

"Just before we started dating, my girlfriend was fwb with a close friend of hers. Although they stopped before we got serious, it weirds me out that he's ""one of her best friends"" and it has come out as a point of tension a couple times.

The past is the past. She can't undo what she did, and she was completely free to do what she wanted with her body. I've come to terms with this. However, I don't think I can put this aside enough to be around them both. It would be the only thing on my mind. Every exchange they have I will be scrutinizing, questioning it - after all, if they're best friends and had the physical attraction to have sex, what keeps him from always being an option? 

As the title says. Canada Day is coming up. My girlfriend invited me to a friend's function (small, one group of friends) where he will most certainly be a primary member. I know I will be distraught, and I know this is just a breeding ground for drama. WIBTA if I hung out with my friends instead?

We’ve been friends since we started working together, however recently we have become quite competitive towards each other. We have both been promoted to management positions in our restaurant locations. In the near future, it is likely that an upper-management position will become available, and one of us will likely fill this position. The boss will choose who is best suited for this job, and here is where the problem comes in. 

I believe that I am better at my job than she is. I learn quicker and am able to do the job more independently and with less help from my superior managers. However, she is much more of a people person. While I am better at physically doing the job, she has a much better relationship with our boss and is a little bit of a kiss ass, meaning he likes her more. She can also be a bit slow and forgetful at times, and often makes little mistakes that she should know how to avoid by now. 

Quite often, this coworker will text me asking questions about how to solve simple problems she encounters at her restaurant. These are always things that she has been taught how to do before and has just forgotten. Up until now, I’ll just tell her how to fix it, as it’s usually a simple fix. It saves her from embarrassing herself in front of her superior by asking them these dumb questions instead of me. 

However, now that we are competing for a promotion, I want to stop helping her. I’m quite conflicted because the things that I’m helping her with are things that she should already know how to do on her own. By having me help her instead of asking our boss, the boss is unaware of how she hasn’t been absorbing and applying many of the things she’s been taught, and how she makes stupid little mistakes a lot. If he was aware of her fruitcake-ness, then I would definitely be the clear candidate for the promotion as she is unfit for upper management. However, I feel bad for stopping helping her because we’re friends and I’ve always been someone she can rely on. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c5y53y	2019-06-26 23:48:03		AITA if I don’t let my 19 year old daughter sleepover with a guy she’s seeing?	So I’m the daughter here. I will be moving countries and may not be coming back for a long time ( petioned by my dad). I’ve started to see my ex again(we dated when we were younger and he didn’t do anything bad before it just didn’t work out). My dad knew this guy because I introduced him as a friend. I kept our relationship from my dad until we broke up, i was 16 then. Last night, I asked my dad if I could travel 6 hrs from here and sleepover at the guy’s house, told him he should trust me and he could talk to the guy thru the phone. I told my dad that me having the courage to ask for permission and plan things out with him shows that I wouldn’t do anything stupid and just he should trust me. I’m still a virgin and have nothing against those who have sex as long as it’s consensual. My dad didn’t even consider discussing it and just dismissed it, told me he was just protecting me. So pissed rn. The guy that I’m seeing has school there and I’m currently not in school, so it’s just reasonable I go see him.	No A-holes here	1	0

However, Im aware I dont get paid the amount someone who has their degree for it would,even though we are doing the same work.I'm not assisting a team, I'm actually managing creating and cultivating content for our social media and trying to make a brand for us(without the benefit of a team or budget to get the equipment needed to create videos and other original content).Its hard because I don't work that many hours,literally 7 hours a week and im trying to do a lot (on top of random clerical duties thrown at me).I actually was given the opportunity to do the same work for more hours for the [summer (still at my school).My](https://summer.my/) boss found this out and told me I could work everyday for the summer .He didnt actually do that when the summer started ( I guess he only said it to keep me from leaving ?)and he recently told me he is going to be letting me go for the rest of the summer so I wont even be getting my 7 hours.A month ago,I started doing filming for a video for our website (sucks because the sound engineer lost my audio files for that video and i cant get the actor to work for free again) \*shout to all these people willing to help me out for free though\*.My boss knew that and asked me if the video would work for a contest with a 5000$ reward for the winner( I made the video before I bought my t7i ,so the footage is trash and the audio will be made with a yeti if the sound engineer wont let me re-record the lines).The contest is open to the public and honestly,I started filming so that I can enter it myself.I dont think I'm even going to bother to make a new video for them(because that is what I was going to do ).I dont even 100% know what they will do with the money if the video I make for them [wins.My](https://wins.my/) boss will know if i do win because he checks that website for updates on the contest

c5y3ye	2019-06-26 23:45:06		WIBTA for letting a friendship die?	"For context, my longtime (15+ years) friend and I have spent tons of time together the past few years. Just the two of us going to night clubs, camping and hiking, sharing hobbies and talking about anything. We're both 22. Like I said we used to be pretty close but now both having gone to college and found girlfriends, we started spending less and less time together. This summer I moved to a small town for work, moving out for the first time which was a big deal for me. 

We went out for food and drinks the week before I moved, and we had a normal conversation like always. I invited him to visit, come camping, go hiking etc which he said he'd be interested in doing. We also talked about his job search, and his job fair which I had attended earlier that week. 

I had only been gone for a week, been pretty busy, havent heard from him so I ask how his job search has been going. Tells me nothing yet, but hopefully he finds a job so he can quit at -insert restaurant here- and come visit.

A week later I messaged him to let him know I transferred money I owed from earlier that year. Tells me thanks, that's it. I got busy with work and out of annoyance, havent texted him since.

Almost one whole month later, he hasn't contacted me since. Not one question about how my new apartment is, how my job is, how my girlfriend is. I've been feeling kind of off about him since it seems that, recently, I'm always the one to reach out. So today, I ask him how the job search has gone. Turns out he has found a job as a web developer! Woohoo! Tell him this calls for celebration and ask why he didnt tell me sooner. I  am yet to receive a response.

I'm going home this weekend to visit the family lake and was going to invite him along to try our new seadoo, but now I'm having serious doubts about this friendship.

I had asked why, despite the fact I've been kicking ass at my job for three years, none of the new managers have asked my input at all about what I need to do my job successfully or how to hell out department succeed, yet [new girl who started in a similar but distinctly different position] gets to make executive decisions that affect our sales. I was in the process of asking a second, related question, why, as low level employees, she and I are made to communicate solely with each other about how to do our jobs correctly rather than management giving us guidance and instruction, but I got halfway through and a customer walked up. New manager told my boss that I called new girl a low level employee in front of a customer, and I got written up. He may have gotten the wrong idea since I was only halfway through my second question, but I clarified everything with him and my boss and she still wrote me up ""so I'd learn a lesson."" (TBH, the lesson I take away from this is to never try to talk to the managers, but whatever.)

TL; DR: Was in the process of asking a new manager why low level employees (myself and another girl) were allowed to make executive decisions instead of getting direction from management, a customer walked up and I got written up for talking badly about a co-worker in front of a customer.

(He reads a lot of reddit like entiltedparents, AITA, etc. He also watches rSlash a lot and he can get annoying with that but thats not what this is about.)

I'm like whoa its a joke fella and it dies down a bit. The convo proceeds and we go to play roblox. He was grinding on a game there all night I presume, so when we come back hes super good and boasts about it.

So I go and make a joke about how hes being a hypocrite along the lines of ""Hypocrisy looks good on you"" and he says how im so egotistical. I then proceed to say ""I mean spending all night on a roblox game dosnt make you good."" 

He then says ""So you decide whos good at the game and who's not?""

Jokingly I say ""Of course it does ""

He gets mad and says ""Fine, post it on AITA, everyone will say your acting egotistical""

So I respond ""Maybe I will then"" which honestly was not ever good because he gets really mad when he is talked about.

He then says ""Well I will sue if you do.""

I dont know the validity of this statement and if I keep him completely anonymous I dont think I can get sued. So I added salt into the wound after he hung up, and kept saying how hes such a bad friend. Been about 30mins now and I feel so guilty for possibly ruining a good friendship, AITA?"

We had a one night stand and we both explicitly agreed that it was a one night stand. 

When we woke up she asked me how old I was. It wasn’t something we exactly considered important to establish the night before and people often tell me that I look a lot younger than I actually am. 

I told her I was 29. I didn’t want to freak her out by telling her I was 38 and I feel as long as though we are strictly just sleeping together then there is no harm done. We are both consenting adults and we both had fun. 

She accepted that answer and we have tentatively agreed to continue to be fuck buddies with no strings attached for now. 

I feel kind of bad that I lied about my age but at the same, like I said, as long as we don’t start a romantic relationship then maybe it doesn’t matter.

c5y237	2019-06-26 23:40:28	nipslip911	"AITA for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?"	"I am 24M and I have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. She is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. 

Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?

**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...

But the part where she says she’s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she’ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**"	Asshole	0	0

c5xz93	2019-06-26 23:34:23	Nothing2specific	Aita for not naming friend God mother of baby?	"I'm pregnant. It took 5 years and I am very cautiously optimistic. I have a friend, we will call her Kate. I have known her 2 years. My best friend, of 16 years, the God mother of my older child, we will call Annie. 

I got pregnant but only told friends and family at first. No FB announcement until weeks later. Annie and I already knew that all of my kids are hers, and hers are mine. She is like my sister. 

I told Kate I was pregnant and despite not really being that close, and all of our get togethers being polite at best, she was much more excited than I expected. She immediately started talking about her role as God mother and how she was going to spoil this baby. 

Well, I told her when I was only 5 weeks, I had only just gotten the news. So I honestly was prepared for the worst and thought rather than point out to her that my children already had a God mother, I would just overlook it, assuming this pregnancy would not last and it would be a non issue. I was very skeptical at this point. But yes, I realize now I should have immediately corrected her. 

Well, months pass and I have forgotten all about this, as like I said, we aren't close, and don't talk all the time. I announce on FB where Annie expresses her excitement for having another God child. Kate then starts bombarding me with angry messages about how I promised that title to her. And how she had called herself the God mother and I hadn't corrected her. I explain exactly what I explained to you... I didn't want to embarrass her and didn't think the pregnancy would last anyway. I told her how sorry I was but the God mother is annie, she is my best friend in the world and God mother to my older child already. I apologized profusely as she threatened to have nothing to do with me or the baby if I didnt change my mind. I didn't give in and haven't heard from her since. About 3 weeks.

I can play a little guitar and sing. And i really liked this girl, lets call her Amy, she was super attractive and really pretty. I was not. We still hung out regularly. We always had fun and shared laughs together.

I asked one of her friends if they knew wether or not she liked me.
""Why would she even like you, you're a fat, lazy anoying piece of sh*t"" 
I figured that Amy never mentioned me, according to this response, and that her friends didnt know if Amy likes me.

I really liked her, and she didn't hate me so my desperate self wrote a song for her, to declare my love towards her, and how i wanted to go on a proper date sometimes. She smiled during the song, which gave me alot of confidence. 
She completely broke down, amy.exe stopped working. Turns out, she didn't like me and didnt know how to properly respond to my love song.
It made her really uncomfortable and she started crying and stuff. I didnt know that she was actually really socially anxious and on meds for that. Didn't know that.

Her friends are now bashing me for still asking her out eventhough they said she didnt like me. (Amy actually told her friends that she didnt like me) and how much of an ass i am for making things so hard for her etc etc.
 I feel like a huge dunce and this event lead into a proper dent in our ""friendship"" and in my last bit of pride at school. Everyone had heard about the rejection and laughs at me for even trying.

When she's unable to do her work, or gets it wrong, I end up being unable to do my work or at least unable to finish it completely because it's missing things from her.

Now, I have the skills to just fill in the missing parts, for example, if she forgets to add an order for our client, I can just do it for her. However, she's relatively new to the job so I figure it's better to tell her she forgot something, and show her how to do it so she won't repeat the mistake later on.

BIG MISTAKE

The interaction is brief, like 5 seconds. This is the first time I've ever corrected her for anything.

Me: Hey Sammy, when we get this request from our client, you have to add this order in.

Sammy: Oh, right...

I hand her the request, she fixes it, and gives it back to me later. No big deal.

Later on, at lunch, my buddy tells me she's been talking shit behind my back. I figure that sucks, screw her then.

Afterwards, she seems to be learning her job well and doesn't make many more errors. The PROBLEM IS she's still talking crap about me behind my back. I have different people telling me to:

1) Leave her alone OR 2) People telling me she's talking crap behind my back.

I go to her and ask if there's anything she wants to say to me. She says no, I ask if she's sure, she says yes, I say alright then.

The shit-talking only intensifies, and apparently I'm harassing her at work now. Drama ensues, only a few people are sticking by me, which kinda makes me sad but at least now I know who I can depend on.

Now comes the day when I see she makes a small mistake but could lead to a large inconvenience for our client. Nothing that would destroy lives but would delay our client's schedule and would make them very unhappy. This mistake went past her, her co-workers, her supervisor, and apparently nobody noticed the problem before it got to me.

So... I send an e-mail to her supervisor about the issue, which is standard protocol but the supervisor is gone for the day and they should (but don't) bother reading their e-mails after they leave.

The next day the client personally shows up and asks about this issue because he arrived in the morning and his people can't get to work because they were missing critical components for their operation.

Our boss smooths things over, gives them a discount on the order, and promises to take care of it himself. The client is satisfied, and leaves with no fuss.

Boss finds out Sammy was the one who made the initial error and fires her, everyone else gets warnings except the supervisor, who said she read my e-mail and was trying to fix the issue. Boss leaves, supervisor thanks me for catching the problem (she probably doesn't realize I could've fixed it myself since it's not actually my job to, and everyone else was too scared to say anything).

One of the cases in my general vicinity is someone with no limb mobility... who smokes. Meaning that every time they want to smoke, someone has to help with the cigarette (lighting it, putting it out, standing close-ish to make sure everything is ok and there's no choking or fire hazards). They NEED the help whenever they want a cigarette.

We have a few smokers in the staff who tend to the smoking sessions, but it's only so long before all the smokers are sick or away and I'll pull the short end of the stick. I do not smoke and the smell of it gives me a headache, and second hand smoking has risks, but I'm young and healthy so the effects are relatively minor. Most likely all I'd be sacraficing is two minutes of comfort.

I am not high enough up the chain to know if this person has a life expectancy. They might have a month to live for all I know. And I've had smokers tell me that nicotine addiction/withdrawal is rough and, if it was their last day on Earth, the first thing they'd do was smoke a cigarette. I can see that side too.

so anyways. my aunt works kinda far and long hours everyday, my uncle gets off way earlier than her and him and my mom are close so they always hang out, no idea what they do but whatever, but whenever they hang they always tell me to not tell me aunt because she’ll freak out thinking they’re doing something bad (not sexual but they both have a history with drugs and my aunts scared when they get together they might plot on it) while my aunt works at a hospital and isn’t involved or drugs or anything like that, my mom is quite the opposite. or was, idk. 

my mom and uncle in law took me to an appt and my aunt started blowing up my phone asking if i had seen my uncle and how he’s ignoring her and their daughter (my cousin who i’m very very close with), and my uncle was talking out loud talking to my mom saying how my aunt was texting and calling him and they were trying to think of an excuse as to why they were together and why he ignored her all day.

then my cousin started asking me “where are you” “is my dad with you” ect. i’m 19 so i’m old enough to know right from wrong and i know what they’re doing isn’t right but i don’t want to be in the middle of it!! so i just didn’t respond to my aunt or my cousin. it’s like if i don’t say anything to my aunt i’m betraying her and my cousin and if i do then i’m betraying my mom and my uncle. idrc abt my uncle but i dont wanna betray my mom as we’re super close, but i’m also close with my aunt.

later on my aunt found out i lied by omission and didn’t tell her where my uncle was and that i was with him the whole time and she went on a whole rant on me fussing me out and now she’s mad at me and idk what to do. it’s not fair my mom and uncle want me to lie for them, i don’t want to but i don’t want to betray ANYONE. so i didn’t lie to my aunt, just didn’t reply but it was still wrong. i just wanna be left alone!!!! but instead i have to get drug into family drama when all i needed was to be picked up from an orthodontist appointment.

am i the asshole for not telling my aunt to avoid making it seem like i’m picking sides or betraying anyone? even though i kinda did betray my aunt by not speaking up? i just feel like it’s not my business and i just don’t wanna be in the middle so i’d rather just keep my mouth shut."

Things have been a little rocky between us lately but we're both committed to making our relationship work. We love each other very much. 

I've noticed that we haven't spent as time with his parents the past few weeks (we normally see them 3x a week/ish) and yesterday I told him that I felt like his mom has been acting ""strange"" with me the past couple of times I've seen her.  He proceeded to tell me that she was upset because I ""tell too many stories"" that I ""have a story for everything and I need to stop it"". It really hit me super hard and I am so incredibly hurt by this. I am a writer and a very language based person. I love to talk and share and listen to others. I had no idea that something inherent to my daily life was so horrible that I need to stop it altogether or be rejected completely by someone whom I care very much about. My boyfriend stopped short of agreeing with her, but admitted that he sees what she is talking about. He said he told me all of this because ""it was either me or her"" (telling me).  I'm afraid this sounds silly but ""telling stories"" is how I communicate, how I relate to others, share myself and my life. 

I do know that sometimes I talk too much and I can be too loud. I wear hearing aids now and that has helped my volume. I am an enthusiastic, outgoing person and I do know it can come across as too much sometimes. But this just really came out of nowhere with her and I am, to be honest, crushed.

After a few months apart, we started hanging out again as friends. Ended up hooking up a few times but again decided not to pursue a relationship. We remained friends. Before ending things with her (again) I had invited her on a weeklong camping trip. A few days after ending things I thought it would be best to rescind the camping invitation as I'm also going with a good friend (30M). Probably not a great experience for him to be stuck for a week with a recently split couple. 

She wouldnt let me rescind the invitation. She already burned vacation days and told all of her friends and family about it. 

She honestly doesnt deserve this but if she comes the trip certainly will not be as enjoyable as it would be without her. I honestly wouldnt mind bringing her as I think we'd get along fine minus a little awkwardness. But, my buddy is an old lifelong friend and I care more about ensuring he has a good time than sharing an experience with someone I probably wont be seeing much afterwards. 

Am I the asshole if I just rescind the invitation and stand firm?"		1	0

So I have this friend B and we’ve been online friends for a few years now. We get along well for the most part, though we do sometimes get into arguments. Mainly because I often think she’s being overly sensitive and she thinks I’m being overly cold and critical (both women for context). Well, currently we have a discord server for easier conversation of multiple things, but it’s just the two of us involved. 

every time B gets mad at me, she kicks me out of the server and won’t invite me back until essentially we end up arguing again via other SM or I just apologize. On the couple of times I didn’t jump to apologize, she’s later came and felt bad and things are okay again temporarily. I should also note that whenever B gets angry she starts a bunch of ‘fuck off’ ‘fuck you’ ‘you’re a bitch’ type of stuff when I don’t find it called for. I don’t do that stuff to her in return, I just tell her it’s unnecessary. 

Of course, I’m not trying to pretend I’m innocent in any of this, if I perceive something as rude, I tell her it’s rude and that it was uncalled for. I tell her often that she should tell me when she’s having a bad day so I can keep in mind not to make it worse, but if I have no context and I find her rude, I get annoyed and I get a bit short with her. 

Also for context I’ve asked that she stops kicking me out of the server when she’s mad and just steps back. She agreed to this previously. 

Yet today, same story. We start arguing and she kicks me out of the server. I talk to her, I don’t apologize, but I suggest that instead I create the server so she can’t kick me anymore because I spoke about it with her in the past but it doesn’t matter. She agreed but became very passive aggressive and giving one-word answers after this.

c5xl70	2019-06-26 23:05:00		AITA for Wanting Roommate's BF Out?	"So.

I live in a three bedroom, two bath apartment. It's three of us girls. One of us has a boyfriend who comes over very frequently, thus me and my friend(the second roommates) have gained a friendship with her and her boyfriend.

Earlier this month, I noticed that he was here a bit TOO frequently. At this point, we were having issues with him coming over and not cleaning up after himself. This made his presence a bit annoying for my and the second roommate.

I asked his girlfriend one day if he has been sleeping here lately. She messaged me back with a ""yes"" and left it at that. This bothered us.

The second roommate and I decided to call for a roommate meeting to address the cleaning issue and him being here.

We discovered that at the point, it had been about two weeks that he was here and that he had been kicked out of his home. His mother apparently found out about his bad grades and made him choose between his girlfriend and staying home. As we can see, he chose his girlfriend.

The second roommate and I were both annoyed because our third roommate failed to disclose this to us or even ask us if we'd be okay with it. This was the second time she did something without our acknowledgement, the first being a copy of the key to our apartment for her bf. This is an even bigger issue because him being here puts us at risk for termination of our lease. 

We told them we'd give them a week to figure stuff and that we think him pitching in for the rent costs would make sense. They agreed.

The day of the talk came and went. They said they couldn't make it because they were planning a party for her mom's birthday, despite us scheduling this a week ago. 

When we finally had our meeting, they said they had no plan. Her bf still isn't talking to his mother and he doesn't have consistent income coming in.

We agreed that he'd need to pay for the time he's been here and that we'd only want just 22% of the prorated rent of him being here. 


They agreed, but haven't given us clear details as to when and how that will happen. We told them that we understand the circumstances, but felt like a plan needs to be made. We never wanted to live with a guy and we don't want to be at risk of loosing our lease.

Our third roommate is gone on vacation while her bf is here.  He just plays video games all day in her room, which concerns the 2nd roommate and I. We aren't really sure if he's actively working or trying to find a new place to live.

Also, I've been telling everyone that we are getting quickly towards our internet limit. He changed his Xbox name to ""MACBOOK"" (which is odd because we all can see the type of device it is in device details) and now we have less than 80gb left before the end of the month. We usually end our months with 300-400 left. He uses it the most based on our xfi app.

I feel bad for his situation, but I feel like him staying will affect our friendships.

c5xkqc	2019-06-26 23:04:01	ThisisAThrowawayi	AITA for being attracted to my Ex's friend?	"Context: I currently live with my Ex. We have been broken up for over a year now. She's been seeing other people, and she has recently started encouraging me to get out of my shell and meet some people.

Ex: Karen
Friend: Kelly 

Last Friday I had to drop something off at a party that Karen was going to because she left her stuff at the apartment. I showed up and as soon as I got there Kelly saw me and jokingly asked if I would have a threesome with her and Karen. I said yes but she would have to convince Karen(*Karen isn't attracted to girls*). I find out that Karen, Kelly, and Kelly's SO had a threesome that Friday night. 

So after that night all of us hung out this past Sunday Kelly came over to our place to play a game. During the game me and Kelly are taking shots, then Kelly started playing with my hair, and I started to touch her leg. While I was feeling on her leg Kelly starts to feel up my leg and grabs my dick. Karen was on the other side of the table watching us, and I thought she was enjoying us playing the game and interacting with each other. Then Karen started to notice that I was feeling on Kelly's leg but did not notice Kelly feeling on my dick. Karen starts to get mad at me, and at some point when I am not around tells Kelly, then tells me that she is fine with Kelly feeling on me but does not like me feeling on Kelly. After that when we start to play a game again, Kelly is still feeling me up, so I put my hand on her leg. Karen notices my hand stares at me and just says ""Stop"". 

After Kelly leaves Karen tells me that she was bothered with me doing that, and at the fact that I kept doing it after she told me that she was bothered by it. I told her that she shouldn't dangle something good in front of me if she doesn't want me to do anything with it. Karen then threatened to just not have Kelly over anymore.

We had already made a plan to hang out again. Before they came over Karen told me that she didn't want us to do anything, so I said I wouldn't but I am not stopping Kelly from anything. Karen messages Kelly and asks not to touch me while she is there.

They talk about why Karen told Kelly not to touch me. Karen's point being that Kelly is her friend and the only way that I would have meet her is through Karen, she doesn't want me to fuck her friend. Kelly is in the boat of love is love and it is meant to be shared, she is attracted to me and that is that. 

Karen asked if I would not and my response was ""since I respect her as a friend, if she doesn't want me to have sex with her friend, then I will not"". Karen is worried that Kelly is a very aggressive to get her way kind of person and thinks that Kelly is going to try to come onto me. I find Kelly very attractive though and she finds me attractive, I personally believe that Karen is just being over jealous about me for no reason, I mean we have been broken up for more than a year, and she has had a few partners since then.

c5xkm7	2019-06-26 23:03:46	sothereisthisgirl	AITA for saving screenshots of my sister’s bigoted comments?	"Okay, so long story short, my sister (Kay) has a daughter (Nicole) who I’m crazy about! I love both of them very very much. Kay and I were always really close growing up. We always said we would be close with the other’s child(ren).

Kay is religious and I am not. I’m also an out lesbian and I’m engaged. Kay doesn’t want Nicole to be around homosexuality. Which granted, is crazy because it’s everywhere, but she has a right to parent as she chooses (I guess). 

Nicole is just a little over a year old now, and she adores me. She always smiles when she sees me and always reaches for me. I seriously am crazy about this child. I love her so much.

I’ve been around Nicole from the day she was born, and just now Kay’s husband is always talking about me behind my back. Telling Kay that he doesn’t want Nicole around me. And Kay fought this for a while. But today she’s informed me I will no longer be allowed Nicole at all.

When i asked her “why all of a sudden?”, she said it was because when I saw Nicole last (several of us were helping Kay and her husband build the addition to their house), she had gotten a little sun and was tanned a bit. Someone said something to the effect of “oh Nicole, you’re looking so tan! We need to find you a cute Mexican boy”. Kay said “no Nicole, we will learn in Kindergarten to match colors!” And I looked at Nicole and said in a ‘baby talk tone’, “No Nicole! You can love whomever you want!”
That comment apparently makes me “a bad influence” on Nicole.

Now, all that info to say that I’ve been arguing with Kay all day how it’s garbage and that she’s a racist bigot, and my lifestyle isn’t a choice. I’m just trying to live. And be with the one I love. Who cares what’s between their legs? And Kay has continually been throwing out hateful remarks. So now I’ve been thinking about taking screenshots of the conversations and printing them to put into a folder/album for Nicole to see when she’s older. So she will know that I didn’t stay out of her life by my choice.

Am I the asshole for wanting to do this?

EDIT: for further background, I love my sister. I want to make sure that’s completely clear. I’m sure there’s more going on here than I’m completely aware about (homophobic husband related, probably).

I’m not going to show these to Nicole with “your mother is an evil horrible person”. I would never do that. But it would be with a “I don’t want you to resent your mom. Or be mad at her or anything. But I want you to understand that I never left. I was pushed out.”

EDIT 2: this has kinda blown up. More replies than I ever expected. I feel it needs to be added to the original post my intentions for this.

I kinda worded my intent a little wrong. I’ve been upset all day and have had a terrible time concentrating. Someone said it perfectly. The main plan is to have it in case this ever comes up and I have proof if Kay tries to deny the exchange. In case Nicole dates interracially, or she’s gay. I don’t know what the future holds, but I hope it’s an opportunity to be in her life and have a relationship with her.

EDIT 3: Wow, I now understand “RIP Inbox”. There are several of you on here trying to antagonize by defending racism. You can just keep on scrolling with that bullshit. In no way shape or form is racism okay. If you’re gonna try to justify it, go somewhere.

Thanks for all the advice everyone. I really appreciate the sympathy and love that I’ve received. You guys are making this a little more bearable.

I’ve decided I will likely save the screenshots just to have, but will likely never let another soul see them. I *will* be writing letters for Nicole. Michelle (my other sister) has agreed to pass them along and to also help to make sure Nicole knows who I am."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5xjqv	2019-06-26 23:02:02	Dinkleberg08	AITA for wanting my slashed tire paid for 11 years after it happened?	"Shortly after I graduated high school in 2007, I moved into an apartment complex that I lived in for about a year and a half with a roommate. In the summer of 2008, one of my car’s tires was slashed, and I never found out who did it. I had to spend $200 to get it fixed, and the whole thing really bothered me.

Flash forward to 2019. I found out just recently, through a friend I made in the apartment complex and have stayed in touch with since, that one of his friends who lived there remembered seeing a woman who lived in the complex named Emma slash my tire. Why he didn’t speak out about this earlier, I’m not sure; maybe he feared Emma targeting him. I remember Emma’s face somewhat, but never spoke to her myself and had no idea why she’d want to slash my tire.

I asked for Emma’s last name from my friend, and got it. I plugged her name into Facebook and found her profile. I shot her a message telling her that I just found out it was her who slashed my tire in 2008, and that I need her to refund me $200. She responded apologizing to me; she said she slashed the tire during a drunken rage against her boyfriend, who lived with her at the time and drove a similar-looking car to mine, causing her to mistake my car for his and slash my tire instead. She insisted she’s cut back on the drinking and tried to control her anger since then.

Emma told me, however, that she won’t be able to give me the money. She says she is now a single mother of three children, struggling financially, and that giving up that much money would be very hard on the family. “I’m sorry it happened, but it was over 10 years ago and I don’t have the money.” She said. “My apology will have to do.”

I don’t absolutely need the money. I make over $60,000 a year, and am single and childless. But extra money is always nice! I’m the kind of guy who gets childishly gleeful whenever I find a penny on the ground, so imagine how great it would be for me to get a bonus $200. $200 could easily cover the cost of a few nice dates out, a concert ticket, or a couple week’s grocery bill.

I responded to Emma telling her now that I have a screenshot of her confessing to slashing my tire, I will forward it to the police and press charges if she doesn’t give me my money. That was kind of an empty threat; I don’t think the cops will charge someone for a slashed tire after 11 years; but from looking at Emma’s Facebook page I don’t get the sense she’s the brightest bulb and that she’d probably fall for it.

After some arguing back and forth, she caved in and asked for my PO box so she could send a check; she told me it’ll be a few days since she’ll have to do some scrimping/borrowing from family to get it. My check should be on the way soon. AITA for expecting to be reimbursed for my slashed tire?"	Asshole	0	0

"A childhood friend I grew up with stopped talking to me for a long time and eventually I managed to contact him through a mutual friend. He, possibly being influenced by his new boyfriend, had stopped talking to me because he had heard through the grape vine that I had tried meth. I hesitate to say I'm clean since I hadn't tried it since but he was very confrontational about the whole ordeal and made the ultimatum that I couldn't do meth if I wanted to talk to him.

A reasonable request.

However, I felt disgusted by his approach to the situation. I interpreted it as if he was unwilling to even try to help me if I had become addicted. He cut off ties with me as soon as he thought I had touched the stuff. I cut ties with him saying a friend who ignores me for months because I might be addicted to meth is no friend at all. 

My friend in question also uses large amounts of weed and other hippie drugs. He has been addict to cigarettes for 4 years and I basically never use drugs in general. It seemed really hypocritical to me.

Cast: ""Kim"" used to be one of my dearest friends. She lived in a town 25 minutes away from mine.
""Friend one"" a friend of mine who was in a discord group where Kim and I met. He knew kim aswell. i know friend one irl. Before the group.
""Friend two"" another friend i know irl, still a great friend to me. He is NOT in the discord group, and didnt even know it existed. He was also friends with friend one

Anyhow, lets get to the story

I used to talk to this girl, lets call her kim, over discord. We immediatelly started talking throught the nights into the mornings. We talked about everything: our happy moment, our sad moments, our families and our greatest achievements. 
I really started to like this girl ALOT. And i got vibes that she really liked me too.

One day, i asked her out, she kindly refused. I was a bit startled by this and asked her: ""why not?"" Kim replied: ""I dont want to look for love, as I haven't even found myself yet. Please dont take this as a definitive answer, but for now. No""
I was devistated and crushed by this. But i accepted it and we still chatted alot. The fact that i now had supressed fealings for her didnt make things easier. I asked her not to tell anyone and to keep this a secret. She was really supportive and a great vent. I still really liked her.
I told kim to please not tell anyone several times.


The next day

""Friend two"" texted me asking if i was allright. I told him: ""Yeah, im fine. Why?""
He said that he heard something from ""friend one"" he knew about kim. I was completely confused, how did friend 1 know?
Turned out Kim has told ""friend one"" the secret. Even though i told her NOT TO. And this was exactly the reason why. I didnt want my irl friends to know about this, as it would get me unwanted attention and people minding my business.

I was so furious at Kim for telling ""friend one"" I asked her who else she told. Turned out she basically told every one else in that discord group aswell. The bish....

I told her that i was done, left the discord group, blocked her socials and also those of ""friend one"" (this is not the first time ""friend one"" broke my trust)

The news spread like wildfire at school, i got bullied all the time and got in several fights. soon the principal was involved and contacted my parents. I was so done at that point

I got constant notifications of kim via other peoples accounts: ""I only wanted to help"" and other kinds of B.S. like how will that help
She also told me that she didnt want to lose me as a friend and that she would be really mad if i left forever and she was crying and all.
She even got a new boyfriend a week later.

But if I relinquish my time the custody agreement changes to me having zero rights or parent time.

She’d been on my back all day essentially saying I’m useless trash and she didn’t know why she kept me blah blah.  We had just gotten back from the store and I need a pan to cook my food. Now there’s this drawer under the oven where the pans go and it makes a loud slamming/crashing noise. Keep in mind my mom knows the drawer makes that noise. So she was downstairs and I opened the drawer got the pan and closed it and it made the same noise it makes EVERY TIME.

This isn’t the first time I’ve put poop bags in someone else’s can, and I don’t care if people put their dog’s poop bags in our rubbish bins.


I’M THE ASSHOLE!!  No more throwing poopsies in anyone’s bin other than our own.  No sarcasm at all, thank you guys for your responses...I’ve been doing this my whole life and this was the first time I’d ever experienced a negative response to it, so I’m actually glad for your guys feedback.  I hadn’t realized people had such strong feelings about it."	Asshole	0	0

c5x0rj	2019-06-26 22:22:59	Morkelpower	AITA for disapproving of my friends' drinking?	"My friends, especially my best friend is a regular drinker. Whenever I learn that someone I care about is drinking at the present time, I always get an uneasy feeling. I have been drunk myself two times, and still don't understand why people drink in the first place. Both times, I had been myself just the same, with the only effect being the loss of some motor control. I get frustrated because I don't understand why my friends drink so regularly.

I understand that it's every individuals' choice to drink. I also understand that it changes the behavior/personality of most people, and I think that that's the problem. I like my friends because of who they are sober. When drunk, they are totally useless, while I'm still functioning. They seem to find it funny, while I have to try to keep my cool.

Am I the asshole or just a concerned friend?

EDIT: 
Some people have mentioned that this post might not be appropriate for r/AmItheAsshole. So if the mods feel like deleting/archiving this thread, they may.

Thank you for the different opinions! I will re-evaluate my opinion and why I feel that way, and talk with my friends if I feel the need to. No matter the outcome, I will try to ease off, as long as the drinking is not becoming a real problem."	No A-holes here	0	0

He’s always ignored my calls and texts but when we he wants something I’m there because I’m a very caring person. Well the dude asked me if I could go and feed/walk his dog tomorrow at 4PM and I said yeah just spot me some gas money since it’s 30 minutes away. Well, he starts going off on this sob story about how he got his business card taken away from his mom (he works for his parents company) and yet brags about how much he makes all the time and buys unnecessary shit like crazy. He has an American Express platinum card he’s always bragging about Too. I told him “don’t give me that shit, I know how much you make, $20 won’t kill you” and said sorry to have bothered you and hung up.

c5wyq2	2019-06-26 22:18:57	littlechipx	WIBTA if I didn’t send the package back?	"So I’d like to preface this post and say that I live and the US and I’m anti-capitalism. 

   So what happened was I ordered three items off of amazon and they were all going to come in to same package. So I was waiting for my package and went into the amazon app to look at the shipping updates and it said that my package had been delivered. I went upstairs to ask if it had come, and big surprise, it was not at my house. 
   So I go back into my amazon app and look at the details and it says that my package was delivered all the way across the country in fuckass New York. 
   So I go and message amazon costumer service and they say that if I don’t get my package by the next day I can get a refund or a replacement. Two days later, no package, I get a refund (aprox. 65USD) and reorder my three items. 
   On Monday I receive my package and I’m super happy with it. Then the next day (yesterday on Tuesday) I get the package that was lost to New York. So now I have two. Whoever received my package by mistake must’ve been someone cool and sent it back to amazon, who sent it to me. 
   Now I don’t need to but my original plan was to split up the singular package and send about half the stuff to my friend who lives in another state. But now that I have two packages I could just sent him the second package and we’re both super happy. 
   The smaller company that I ordered from still got the money from both orders, and the only people who lost out is amazon. And tbh I don’t really care that amazon lost 65$ dollars because they’re a filthy fucking rich company. So WIBTA if I didn’t send the second package back to amazon and just mailed it to my friend instead?

Edit: so some people are saying that it’s not right that I’m anti-capitalist but still order from amazon so please let me clarify- I am not in a position where it is particularly easy for me to practice my beliefs. That doesn’t mean that I can’t still have my stand point on it. I’m still against capitalism but I’m not in much of a position to avoid it and I feel terrible that that’s how it has to be. And I’m not using my anti-capitalism standpoint as an excuse to steal, I brought it up because it’s the reason that I don’t care about amazon being out 65$.

Edit 2: I don’t care that much about stealing. Sorry I’m not practicing my beliefs well enough for you. Please understand that I’m new to thinking this way, I’m still adjusting, and I’m doing my best. I don’t care that I “stole the package”. I don’t think it’s stealing in the case really, the company who produces the products got money for both packages. I 100% do not care about or feel bad for “stealing from amazon”. Sorry I’m not a good enough anti-capitalist for you, I’m a 15 year old child who can’t get a job that supports my abilities to live out my beliefs. I realize that I’m only not an ass if you have the same morals for me. I did not post this to be mocked and talked to to for not being a good enough anti-capitalist, I came to ask wether or not I should feel bad about keeping the package. Which I don’t.  None of y’all are being helpful so you can stop throwing your two pennies in, thanks."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So, I'll cut to the chase. Earlier on, I ate something by accident that I shouldn't of which resulted in a bit of an embarrasing problem a few hours later - which I won't get into detail but I'm sure you'll understand the idea. I've had this issue for years and it hasn't hit me this bad until today.

I was the mall when this happened, and for some stupid reason, you have to pay at this machine thing to use the public restrooms. Which I had no money for. The disabled/baby change one was free of charge so I frantically jumped in there because I was really close to shitting myself, literally. I saw a mother and her baby approaching it before I went in (they were far though but were making a bee-line for it). I went straight in before them. 

Once I was done, she lectured me about how I wasn't disabled, and she needed to go in there to change her kid. I didn't bother arguing with her and just pretended I didn't speak English so I didn't have to explain to her, and walked off.

If I let her in first, I would have shit myself in public and that's not something I would imagine most would sacrifice.  

I'm not disabled, just to clarify, but would you have done the same in the situation? Or was I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Things seemed great, we made plans for a friday after work and she seemed very excited. Then that day she ghosted. No warning signs, no communication, nothing. Naturally I was very upset and thought something might of happened and tried to reach her over the next several days on her phone, snap, facebook but all got ignored. I didn't see why she would do that, I was never abusive or anything and always tried to listen to her and do small things off what she told me to make her smile. However, i saw that she was seeing my messages and still posting normal on social media so I stopped trying to contact her then and 'accepted' what happened.

Fast forward a year and I'm back in my hometown for summer from law school, I go out with some friends to a bar to meet a group of people my one friend wanted to link up with and lo and behold she's one of those people. I was shocked to be honest, I havent heard from her in all that time and it was a girl that I had talked to for awhile before dating and started to have strong feelings for. She seemed very uncomfortable and gave me an ""oh....hey.."" 
To which I responded normally, not wanting to ruin the night. Got pretty drunk and there was a point where it was only the two of us at a table and she tried to start up a random meaningless conversation to which I replied ""yea I'd actually try to talk to you, but you'd just fucking stop in the middle and leave cause you dont give a shit about anyone but yourself"" and called it a night and uber'd home. 

I got a text from one of my friends saying some of the girls were upset with me cause I was a dick to ""her"" and made her upset and they seemed on her side. AITA?"		1	0

"This happened a few years back when my best friend and I were invited to a wedding in a place we've never been before in a totally different country. We kind of knew the couple that was going to get married but then again, not really. Somehow we were still invited. We only had ourselves and we are not very social either, which meant that we probably weren't going to want to meet anybody new there.

But I did end up talking up a girl I found pretty attractive. We quickly got into a conversation and ended up spending the three days my friend and I have spent there together. But I never really included my friend in any of this. I talked to her alone, went for walks with her alone and even went shopping to the mall with her as I walked past my friend in the hotel lobby. This was back in 2014 but I still feel a little guilty. But then again, I'm not sure if I should have to, since we're both adult and we should be allowed to do things seperately.

We never really talked about this once we came back from the wedding but it's something that I've been wondering about."	Asshole	0	0
c5wstt	2019-06-26 22:07:32	iwantbutter	AITA for not wanting my son to have a relationship with my MIL?	"My husband, kiddo and I moved 800ish miles away from our families so my husband could pursue his dream job. His mother and us have had a pretty tense relationship that resulted in a lot of conflict where we decided it was healthier if we just cut contact with her. 

Example 1: she came to my place of work before we were pregnant with kiddo to yell at me about not being included in our miscarriage that happened 6 months prior. 

Example 2: my husband invited her and my FIL to his college graduation and they never responded, only for us to find out they decided to visit my brother in law who they see every weekend. 

Example 3: the day we brought kiddo home, she sends a string of text messages and passive aggressive PUBLIC Facebook posts about how she's pissed she didnt get to immediately hold kiddo. My husband says that's unfortunate, and she should've communicated her wants, but this is rude. She then proceeds to call him a shit son, a shit husband and a shit father. 

Our kiddo is not her first or her only grandkid. And my parents are plenty involved with wanting to be there for our family. But often I feel guilty about keeping our kiddo from my MIL because she is capable of being kind and sweet especially to her grandkids."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So my friend, let’s call her Lucy, has been seeing this guy for about 6 months. She fell in love with him right away, (mostly because he told her right away he loved her and that he wanted to marry her and complimented her constantly etc.) and after a few months of them seeing each other it was her birthday. He built up her “birthday dinner and day” for weeks before and then the day before said he was too broke and couldn’t afford it. He did the exact same thing for Valentine’s Day and while she was bummed she gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

However, about a week later he went out and bought them like $200 worth of kinky sex stuff (he’s into all kinds of stuff) and it really made me mad- you can’t buy her something nice for vday or her bday but you can spend $200 on sex toys? Alright. 

We also had a “situation” when they first started dating where he claimed that she punched him repeatedly in the chest and “abused” him while drunk, meanwhile we were all there and that definitely did not happen as they were not alone and we didn’t see that happen. So he’s a liar and a manipulator. 

Then a month later, after him still not being able to pay for ANYTHING they do (my friend definitely was annoyed but was in love with this guy so continued to give him the BOTD) he buys an $800 motorcycle. And then buys his dad a Cadillac. 

Fast forward another two months and here we are. He lets her know he got a job offer across the country and when she expresses support and that she’ll support him no matter what he has a meltdown and refuses to speak to her for 3 days. (Coincidentally also causing them to miss a concert that he was supposed to pay for the tickets) He finally got back to her and told her that he is going to take the job and now she’s very upset that he’s moving, although they are going to try to make long distance work. 

Trust me, I 100% understand that that is hard and that truly sucks, but so does this guy and I’m honestly just done with his bullshit, and I just can’t tell her that it’ll all be okay, I want to say that he’s not worth crying over.

c5wsg5	2019-06-26 22:06:45	legwarming	AITA for telling my ex his friend was going behind his back?	Trying to make a long story short. My ex and I have been together for about a year. In the meantime I met some of his friends. We had a rough breakup but are somewhat friends now. One of his friends started talking to me, accidentally sent me something. After a while he started saying romantic stuff. I tried to shrug it off, then at some point I asked him if he should say these things to his friend's ex (me), that it was making me uncomfortable. So he said it was only jokes, that he would never go behind his friend like that, and I shouldn't worry. So I left it. We also had good talks, so I thought, this is just a weird part of his personality. Maybe I was naive thinking that. He continued it, and today was the last time before I decided to tell my ex about it. I just didn't know what to do anymore, felt wrong to keep talking to him and felt wrong not to tell my ex. So I told him. And now they are in a major fight, my ex never wants to see him again even though they've been childhood friends. His friend was crying apparently and it's all a mess. You can probably guess that I feel like this is all my fault and I should have just kept my mouth shut. I don't know. Am I the asshole for telling my ex what his friend was doing?	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5wqgd	2019-06-26 22:03:02		AITA: Using A Gift Not Meant For Me?	"I have an Amazon registry for my baby ( due August 2nd - but medically issues are arising and it could be very soon) - we have two other young children but we need some items for the new baby like bottles, diapers, car seat. My aunt through marriage ( divorced from my dad's brother) ( I met her a few times) and she follows my kids through Facebook  ( who is retired and I do not know how well she works the computer) - filled my entire diaper fund on Amazon. Amazon has a diaper fund option for people to put money in for you to buy diapers. Amazon defaults to the full amount $550 - you do have to check out so you see the amount. 

Imagine my shock seeing a distant relative ( who is not close with any other family ) spend $550 on the baby. 

This was a week ago. I let a day go by thinking she would catch her mistake. I told my dad and he said no way she would spend that much. I messaged her through the only contact information I have which is Facebook. She has not replied. . We have about $300 worth of other items that need to be purchased before the baby is here - my family and his have not bought much off the registry ( mainly due to the fact we just had twins 24 months ago and they think they have more time - we have updated everyone about the baby coming early a week ago and still no purchases). 

It would be amazing relief for us just to buy everything we need ourselves that we need and have it ready - which we could do knowing we have our diapers covered for the year. We had some unexpected bills come up this past month that really depleted our extra budget. 

Question: Would it be wrong to use the diaper fund money ( that I have not confirmed if she meant to give us $550 - the full amount) to stock up on diapers for the year for the new baby? Or let it sit there unused? My plan was letting it go for a month so she would see her mistake on her credit card bill - but baby is not going to allow me another month now. The baby could be coming as soon as Friday.   
We are planning on going to use discount stores and free and trade groups locally as much as possible for the items."	Asshole	1	0

Two years ago my mother and I had an apartment fire and were homeless for a few months. Mom stayed with friends, I stayed with my dad. (I usually spend time there around christmas anyways) 


Whenever dinner was ready I would take it into my room and eat in private. This only seemed to piss my dad off. Claiming that I don't spend time with him, which is bullshit because at the time we lived in the same home and he could easily knock on the door to small cramped sewing room I made into my dwelling for the time being.


I didn't eat dinner at the table for two reasons: 1 I have acid reflux and sometimes have trouble finishing my meals. My father gives me a hard time and claims if I didn't eat crap I would be able to clean my plate. The problem here is that he makes more than enough food for 5 people when there's only two of us. 2. The layout of the house means i'm in open view. The only doors of the house are the bedrooms and bathroom. So I get people staring at me while I eat. Plus my dad and grandma inhale their food, eating it in seconds whereas I can still be at the table for at least a half hour later. This makes things awkward and as I result I take meals into my room, or flat out make my own. (Which I get shit for too). But then he goes on spiel about how the ""family"" eats at the table.

c5wp43	2019-06-26 22:00:26	chill_i_dog	AITA For not going to my (f21) best friends (f21) birthday	"So my best friend I've known my whole life has celebrated her birthday last weekend. This weekend it's really her birthday like the date itself. 

But I went to her birthday last weekend and we gave her an awesome gift which I'm not going to tell because details. And she loved it, there was a lot of time put into that gift. 

So a few hours ago she texts our groups app and says she wants to drink with us this Saturday because it's her birthday. I of course understand but I have 2 birthdays planned and a day with my parents in law. So I'm gone the whole day and night. I was invited for these weeks ago even months. 

She became angry with me and her boyfriend even texted me that I better show up. But I thought she celebrated it last weekend and she never indicated that she wanted me to keep the evening free. I did offer going out friday night or Sunday but she is gone those days. I just assumed she would be with her family on her birthday.

So right now she's mad at me and her boyfriend is siding with her.  I'm going to try to make it in-between birthdays which does mean that I'll probably miss half of those birthdays because I'm afraid I might lose her over this. 

So AITA for not going? Should I cancel those other birthdays? 

TLDR: best friend's birthday is this weekend but she celebrated it last weekend and gets mad I have plans which were made long ago on her real birthday.

Edit: I celebrated my birthday also on another date and didn't expect/ask her to come because I know it wouldn't be necessary. Maybe those are just my priorities and my birthday was on a Tuesday"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5wj9f	2019-06-26 21:48:51	channabatura	AITA for not giving a donation to my boyfriend’s mothers charity walk?	"TDLR: bf rings asks me to donate to his mums ‘fundraising campaign’ for her charity walk tomorrow night. I say no, he blanks me. 

Just saw two missed video calls from my bf so I ring him back and he immediately tells me that his mum is doing a charity walk tomorrow night and if I can donate. Although he asks, the tone was more of like its expected. 

Bfs mother and I have had a complicated last 6 months with her other son threatening me and not apologising until 4 months later. Bfs mother backed the son the whole time saying (never to my face because she refused to meet me until 2 months ago) that I was basically asking for it. 

Only in the last couple months have things got better and I’ve seen her twice since then. We don’t have any sort of relationship at all and I still find it awkward and have to try a lot just to make conversation with them when I have seen her. 

Other than that bf and I are strong and he donated £100 to me back in October for a walk that I did. So he asks me to donate saying that his mum asked him and ‘his gf’ to donate to her. Bearing in mind that she knows that I am currently not working and that my bf doesn’t earn a salary either at the moment. 

I am all for supporting charity and I do my bit when I can and I feel like people are really trying with their fundraising. But the fact that she has literally just told her son the night before her walk that she needs donations out of nowhere (her donation sheet was empty) is kinda shit, I don’t understand why she expects or even thinks it’s okay to ask my bf to ask me to donate when we don’t even have a great relationship where she can message me herself or come on the phone when my bf rang me to ask me herself. So I said it was rude and I could have been asked in a better way and that I don’t feel like I have to. 

Bf and I start arguing about it and he’s gone to bed angry at me and won’t reply to my messages explaining my decision and opinion about it all. He’s saying that he’s cancelling our weekend plans and that he doesn’t want to see me which I think is unfair.

I explained that if it was him fundraising I would donate £100 without thinking to him but it’s not him in this case.

c5wiwl	2019-06-26 21:48:07	sunnysun0	AITA for missing my girlfriends sisters birthday party to work on my novel?	"I really honestly can’t tell if I’m being an asshole here.

Some context: I’m a writer, I work in editing and I’m nearing the end of my first novel. My creative outlets are really important to me and writing this novel is my dream. 

My girlfriend Anna (we’ve been together 3 years) has never been particularly close with her sister, Beatrice. They have been close at times and even lived together once but they have a pretty on/off relationship and fall out frequently, mostly due to her sisters crazy impulsive decisions. Recently they have been getting closer, particularly after the loss of their Aunt, who died a few months ago.

This weekend it was Beatrice’s 27th birthday. I am 24 and my girlfriend is 25, if that adds any context. Beatrice invited us both to a family party, and we accepted. I can’t say I was looking forward to going but I was going to go.

I’ve recently really been struggling with my writing - and Anna has been super supportive. We even had an arrangement where she would go to her friends every Tuesday so I could always have that night to concentrate on my writing. 

The night before Beatrice’s birthday party, I got into a real writing flow. I had been stuck at a certain point for so long and then all the ideas and everything just came flowing out of me. I stayed up till 4am writing stuff, and then I spent the whole early afternoon the next day writing too. I asked Anna if it would be okay for me to miss the party, because I was doing really well and I didn’t want to stop. 

I feel like it’s hard to understand unless you’re a creative person but it’s so frustrating to be stuck in a rut for so long, and when you finally have a breakthrough, you don’t want that to stop. In those 2 days I wrote double what I’ve written in 3 weeks.

Anna said it was fine, and then she went outside and called her parents. When she came back in, she seemed a bit standoffish and then told me I should come to the party. We argued about it for a while and then she just left, and I didn’t attend the party.

She’s angry at me, she says she wanted my support at what would be a difficult event, and I wasn’t there for her. I totally understand that, but at the same time, this is my career and my dream I have to be committed to that.

Because I've been wanting to cook/host more, I invested in some higher-quality/more expensive items.

When my roommate came back around, I told him that I don't want to share some of these items because they're on the higher-quality side and am planning to take them with me whenever I move out in the future. Also, his standard for cleanliness in terms of washing dishes and upkeep for taking care of personal belongings is slightly lower than mine but I didn't tell him that (because I'm a little more fastidious about these things). He seemed upset and concerned because he now has to purchase all these items for himself and wishes I would've given him a heads-up. (Note: space isn't really an issue for us, and cost is always a factor for us but more him than me)

I also just don't like my personal belongings being touched/rummaged through: At our past apartment, I was fine with sharing everything since there was very limited space and it would be very unreasonable to insist on getting two sets of everything/personal space was scarce. But since moving to our new and bigger place, I've been a little more picky/attentive about my belongings.

AITA for being a little more possessive with my things or am I being reasonable?  


EDIT: There are still some items from our old apartment that I said we'll continue to share (i.e. utensils, some huge pots, etc.) Not sure if this makes a difference."	No A-holes here	0	0
c5whu9	2019-06-26 21:46:09	BasicLifeguard	AITA for being tough on a coworker?	Throwaway and names have been changed. I live in a small town and most people know each other to some extent. I used to work with this guy named Jared. At a work party I got really drunk and told Jared that I thought he was lanky. I was totally wasted, he got a little mad and pretty much just called me fat. I am slightly overweight. Anyways, I switched jobs later, and I just happened to be working with Jared's girlfriend Ally. Ally is not a great team player. She and Jared attended one work event, where they left because another worker said Jared was flirting with her. Next time I invited just Ally, and not Jared. Ally didn't go. Two weeks ago we went for drinks and Ally went, but didn't want to drink. I asked her why and she told us she might be be pregnant. We scolded her for being so irresponsible and not being on birth control. This girl just really aggravates me she makes stupid decisions.  She really didn't want to hear our critique and changed the subject. Yesterday we went for coffee and despite me offering to pay for a coffee or get her a tea, she said she didn't want anything. Again, not a great team player and kind of annoying. Yesterday at work she had to give a presentation and got visible upset when we gave her critique. When she went back to her seat she tripped over her skirt and fell. I couldn't help it, I laughed out loud. She got up and ran out of the room crying. Today our boss informed us that she had quit and cited early maternity leave. I kind of feel like my laughing at her had something to do with it, but I think she could be tougher. Am I the asshole for being tough on her?	Asshole	0	0

c5wfox	2019-06-26 21:41:46	FooxFoot	"AITA for giving myself ""plenty"" of space in between me and the car in front of me in heavy/medium traffic?"	"Ok, let me set the stage. I sit in heavy to medium traffic 4-5 days out of the work week, so this is a question I think about on a weekly basis. When I ask my friends they are generally 100% YTA, but when I ask what their reasons are its usually one of, or a combination of, its frustrating, it slows everyone down, it adds time to their commute, or it makes them brake more frequently, which I don't believe all, if any, of these reasons to be valid.

Ok, with that out of the way let me set the stage. Its any given workday and I am stuck in heavy/ medium traffic. I am driving a manual car (I'll touch on this point later) and I generally like to give myself 100-200 feet, sometimes more, between me and the car in front of me. My reasons are as follows.

A. It gives me plenty of space to brake should the car in front of me come to a abrupt stop (low importance) 

B. It gives others room to filter into the HOV lanes or to their exit

C. It saves gas and headache as you're not constantly accelerating and stopping because of the car in front of you

D. (And this is the most important point for me) I hate transitioning from 0 Mph into 1st gear. (Dont get me wrong I could do it with my eyes closed and my hands tied) I just prefer coasting at 5-10 mph when I transition into 1st gear. 

This behavior sometimes results in one of, or a combination of the following happening. The driver behind me honks, flips me the bird, yells obscenities, or flies around me in a manner that endangers either himself, someone else or all of us. 

I genuinely think Reddit is gonna be split on this one but let me know what you think!

So Edit #1. WOW. Was not expecting to be this much of an asshole. I don’t know if this will clear things up or not but I’m sensing a tiny bit of confusion. I don’t stop 100 ft before the car. I’ll roll up right behind the car it’ll just take my 5-10 seconds longer to get there. 
I guess reduce the distance to 3-4 second delay but to answer one or two of your questions...
When the car in front of me let’s of the brake I do too. I just go slower to allow the gap to build and then I go the same speed as the car in front.

Quick Edit #1.1 The point isn’t for everyone to do this. Maybe every 10th-15th car can take a little bit more of a gap? Everyone saying what if everyone did this y’all are 100% right that would suck but what if in 400 cars maybe 20-30 people gave a little extra gap?"	Asshole	0	0
c5wf4p	2019-06-26 21:40:46	MartianManhater	AITA for wanting to lie to landlords about the number of cats we have?	"My partner and I are moving to another state for their military service. We have three cats. All listings in the city we're moving to so far have a two cat maximum, firm (I've called a ton of places and no one allows more than two, even with a larger deposit, good landlord references for our cats, etc.).

I say we just lie. It doesn't really matter, as our cats won't wreck anything, and if they do, we paid a deposit for just that. We need a place to live and only have about ten days to find something.

My partner is adamant that we don't lie, because maintenance or the landlord could come in and see we have three cats and kick us out and keep our deposit.

In all my years of renting I've never had a maintenance person care or notice my pets, and I just don't think it's a big deal. Our cats also all look very similar and hide when strangers come in.

So, AITA for wanting to lie? My partner is very lawful neutral which is new to me, a landlord-hating cretin."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5weh1	2019-06-26 21:39:28	MotherMine	AITA for ignoring my mother for a year?	"Hooray creepy/relevant reddit-suggested throwaway name.

My mother and I have always had a strained relationship. After divorcing my father, she married an abusive, alcoholic narcissist. I was berated and hit on a routine basis. My phone/computer were confiscated more times than I could count. He took my bedroom door off the hinges for months at a time. I wasn’t a bad kid. I didn’t have many friends (severe social anxiety) so it’s not like I was out going out late, getting wasted, or cutting school. All of these punishments were the result of me “talking back”/having a “disrespectful tone.” Naturally, I can’t help but hold some resentment.

I landed an IT job and moved far away after high school. She got divorced. I tried my best to put effort into rebuilding our relationship. In three years, she only came to “visit” me once for a dinner. I now live less than two hours away from her. We saw each other occasionally. There were good times and bad.

Everything came to a head last summer when I broke my leg. She was crying on the phone, saying she was going to quit her job to come take care of me. She was going on about how guilty she felt for “not being there to protect me.” I told her that she should definitely *not* quit her job, but that everything was okay. She and my father worked out a schedule where they’d each be here for a day every other week to help me pick up groceries. 

The night before her second trip, I texted her asking what time she thought she would get here and saying that I was excited to see her. She ignored me, but texted my father. He forwarded the screenshots. It was paragraphs about how I was a “disrespectful, entitled bitch” to “expect her to drop everything” to come help me. I finally went ballistic and called her every horrible name I could think of, told her I hoped she was never in a position where she was incapable of taking care of herself, blaming her for the years of abuse, and then blocked her phone number and all her social media accounts.

In the months following, she’s sent a handful of family members after me to tell me how sorry she is, that she misses me, she’s really proud but “intimidated” by me (wtf?) I haven’t answered a single message.

Yesterday she called my father sobbing saying she was “completely broken” over the situation. My father explained that she had hurt me severely, and that I probably didn’t believe she was sincere. She then complained about what a difficult child I was. She even whined that I was “sneaking out all the time” as a teenager. That literally never happened. It’s not like I had many friends to sneak out with. Even if it had, it’s been over a decade and, honestly, she needs to get the fuck over it. 

I can’t even think of what I would say to her at this point. I truly don’t have one fucking iota of patience anymore. Her side of the family all think I’m a massive asshole, obviously.

Also sorry for formatting.

I was at a school related function when I was outside and meeting up with some friends. They all got ahead of me so I had to try to catch up to them. I was looking towards one guy and walking to him who was off in the distance. I guess I wasn't paying attention to the foreground because I tripped over an old lady's wheelchair and went tumbling down on the ground. Not gonna lie, it kinda hurt. I immediately made a mistake and went to apologize to the old lady. She was outraged and looked on to other people and gave them a look that suggested ""Hey, look at this asshole."" I said sorry a few times and then left because clearly, she was pissed off and I didn't want to make things worse by pestering her. 

However, later, I geard her say something that fucking shocked me. She said ""Ugh, look at these (insert race) people, always ruining everything (or something like that, I rly dont remember much),"" For some context, our city has been divided between races and a lot of the newer people that are moving in aren't white. I've never pulled the race card ever, as I dont believe its the right thing to do but as time passes, its starting to get more relevant. 

So in the end, Idk, was I being an asshole? I kinda want to know cuz I still feel rly bad, but also angry at what she said. So tell me..."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5wd8w	2019-06-26 21:37:02	AITAfoodarguement	AITA for ordering food without GF	"Ok heres the situation, reasonably minor arguement but hey I figure this is still the place to settle things.

Me and a work colleague planned to go for a drink after work, this plan then evolved to a drink and dinner. I invited my girlfriend along as she likes to feel included and my colleague was fine with it. She is also pregnant which is somewhat relevant. We both finish work at 4. Girlfriend works an earlier shift so she can meet us at 4:30.

We go to the pub first for a drink before going to the food hall to have a single drink. Girlfriend says she doesnt want to sit and watch us drink alcohol as she is pregnant, she also cites feeling tired and suffering from back pain. She instead goes home first to meet us at the food hall later.

At 5pm Me and colleague arrive at food hall and sit and have another drink. At 5:40 she states she was comfortable at home and has only just left and will be 30 mins. The food hall is various stalls to get food so different than ordering at say a resturant so at 6pm I say to my colleague we should order as girlfriend will be here soon.

At 6:25 girlfriend arrives and is upset about a) me going to the pub first and b) ordering food without her.

She states had we gone straight to the resturant she would have arrrived at 4:30 and not gone home. I dont think its reasonable to expect anyone to wait an hour and a half to order food when the reason you are late is through choice...

I thought it would just be a case of shes upset but will get over it however she hasn't dropped the matter and says it was really rude of me to invite her out to dinner and not wait for her to order...

I don't like arguing with my girlfriend and love her very much but this argument is upsetting me and I don't feel I am in the wrong but I have apologised numerous times yet that isnt enough...

we are both 17f

my friend is part maori, (her grandfather is maori) so I think that she is a quarter maori. 
I might have my math wrong. 
she discovered that because she is slightly maori she can get most of her tuition free. she is super excited and wants to take up the offer. 

my issue is that she is rich and does not need to take it, she just wants to because she can. 
I've tried to explain that it could be going to a maori kid who needs it but she seems to not care. 

after a heated argument yesterday over it I called her a shity person for taking something you don't need. I also told her that she was the definition of rich privilege. 

she is now refusing to speak to me and I think I fucked up.

I only do that with people I know tho, I don’t see the need to greet every person who walks by. A few hours ago I was walking to a friend while on my phone texting someone. I was already in his street when I saw around 6-7 people standing in front of a house talking to each other and staring at me. That was already weird. So I rather stayed focused on my phone and walked by. After a few meters I heard a woman say loudly in their conversation ""Look how the kids are nowadays. I would beat my kid if it acts like this, not saying hello“. I‘m 19 and live in Germany by the way. I was very close to turn around and start arguing with her but I kept walking. Am I the asshole here? They didn’t even say hello, just creep ass staring at me. If they said hello, I would have also greeted them. Otherwise I don’t see it as disrespectful.

The older lady was like “should we go back” and the younger one said “No it was her” despite me having nothing in my hands or pockets. I had leggings on and a T-shirt so it would’ve been clearly obvious if I was stealing. 

So I said “what the fuck, it wasn’t”. I wasn’t even close to the doors alarm to set it off. Then the younger one wanted to call the manager over. She told the cashier I was stealing. 

So they weren’t allowed to check me but another worker told the manager I was basically with him the whole time I was in there.

I love my parents. However, they can really put on a guilt trip whenever I say no, and I am now in my late 20s. They're so good, my sister has picked up their techniques.

I've been working ten hours shifts for the third week straight. I come home today, and my mom asked if I'd be willing to drive thirty minutes to pick up supper from Chick-fil-A and bring it home. I've been awake for over twelve hours by the time I'm typing this. I'm tired. I almost fell asleep at the wheel on my way home, and I even had some caffeine in my system.

He woke up later than I did this morning. We say hey. We both mention how tired we are. Then Dad says, ""We're not asking for much."" Apparently Mom called him to complain.

 I know it sounds like it ain't much. But I'm honestly afraid I'm gonna fall asleep coming back from Chick-fil-A.

c5w52b	2019-06-26 21:21:03		AITA : Made out with a married father of two while wasted after my boyfriend did an Irish goodbye	"A party was thrown for me by my coworkers because I was moving away to another city the very next day with my boyfriend (we both got transferred by our jobs at the same time). It was a rager. Ended up at a karaoke bar. My boyfriend left without telling me at some point because he could be shifty like that (side note, he was an emotionally abusive boyfriend, not really relevant to my actions but just to paint the scene a little... this guy used to do things like tell me I walk/pee too loudly, tell me I'm stupid, bad temper etc... I am probably the asshole for dating him for two years). Later in the night, I got a text from a guy... lets call him N. I was a client of his at the time, we were friendly. N asked if he could crash the party. N arrives, buys a couple of rounds of Jaeger bombs. I walk up to him and say, ""you were fun to work with, I feel like we really got along well"". N responds with something like ""I totally agree, and my dick is SO hard right now."" I wander off somewhat in shock after he said that. N circles back a few minutes later and kisses me.  I kiss back. It gets pretty hazy from that point onward, but in my drunk mind I did not remember that I was in a relationship and went into some kind of drunk auto pilot. I think we made out a couple of times. As the title of this post says, the guy is married with two little girls. One of my good friends spotted me and said it's probably time to get you in an uber. I had kissed this dude in front of at least one coworker and a friend of my brothers (not that being seen made it worse, but just shows how out of it I was, I guess). Next morning I wake up and boyfriend asks me how the rest of the night was. I said, ""not great"" and told him that N (whom he has met) kissed me last night. Boyfriend yells at me to give him a minute to process when I ask if he is ok. Asked how long we kissed for. I admitted it was more than a brief kiss but don't tell him it was multiple instances throughout the night. He thinks about it then tells me it better not happen again but that he can move past it. He never mentions it again. The relationship ended about 6 months later, but I am still ashamed of what happened that night. Part of me was mad at my boyfriend for leaving me there like that, but I know I have to take responsibility.  Even though I'm ashamed of this, strangely a small part of me felt a little proud I unintentionally did this to my now ex boyfriend because he left me there and would have never thought I would end up kissing some other guy when he left--it felt good to do something that surprised him because he thought I was the nice girl who would be predictable, safe and do anything for him.

c5w45l	2019-06-26 21:19:15	tyrionsDrinkbuddy	WIBTA if I ceased contact with my father-to-be friend?	"About 9 months ago I was in a tough spot. I had just started what’s considered the little leagues to my dream job (they’re moving me to the big leagues come January 2020). I dedicated myself to it and as a result, my relationship got shady. She cheated, I left her, all said and done, not upset about it anymore.

At this turning point in my life, I started frequenting a bar where I made a somewhat pretentious friend. He’s roughly 8 years older than I am and expects me to really be a source of clubbing and fun for him. Our friendship was great and he was there for me when I was alone in a new city and out of what I thought to be my last relationship. He, also was just out of relationship.

Well to back up, 4 months ago he calls me and says hey can you meet up with me at a bar. At this time, his girlfriend had announced on all social media forms that she was pregnant BUT never contacted him. He finds out that it’s his about a week later. They start to work it out. But it’s obvious, he doesn’t want to give her another chance. I’m unclear on why exactly they had broken up. It wasn’t long before he has a new girlfriend, but she found out about the baby and left him.

Well, 2 months ago I moved to a new place, roughly 30 min away to begin working at our corporate headquarters. At this time, we slowly started drifting apart. I had always known that we’re drastically different people and was not that upset about it. But I still go over when he wants to hangout. He, never comes this way. 

About a month ago I get another distress call from him. But this time he’s asking me for money. He needs $1,300, a sizable chunk, to pay his rent and he promises he will pay me back. I denied him. 2 weekends ago he hits me up and I decide what the hell, let’s get a drink. We go to an bourbon/oyster bar and not wanting to talk about life or anything, he immediately tries to get the bartenders number (if his ex wasn’t expecting, I wouldn’t have blamed him). 

The bill comes and he made this joke about Venmo. Well, his credit card gets denied so I take the bill, and immediately say hey man just Venmo me. Out of courtesy, I wait for a few days to collect. But when I do, he tells me his Venmo is frozen (my first thought was “I didn’t know you were drug dealer”). But since then he’s made no effort to pay me back. 

Instead, he pretends nothing happened and asks if we can go to the clubs this last weekend while I was out of town. Thankfully, I was in a different state. 

Anyway, WBITA if I said dude, I don’t agree with you trying to meet new women at this time, you owe me money, and I generally don’t have anything in common with you? He won’t even give his ex a second chance although she did nothing wrong to my knowledge.."	Not enough info	0	0

c5vzxf	2019-06-26 21:11:18		AITA for not being okay with my gf going to a party without a bra	"Disclaimer: I'm going to put fairly important info at the bottom of this message. Not trying to clickbait but I want to explain this story first

So my (19m) girlfriend (19f) is really into tattoos, piercings, ext. I do not like them at all. Just a personal preference but I honestly do not find any sort of body modification attractive. Tbh I don't even really like regular ear piercings.

She knows that I don't like these things and it upsets her that I don't find something on her attractive, but I've explained to her that I always find her beautiful regardless of what she's dressed in or what she has on her body. That is a completely true statement as well. So during the event that I will explain later on, she decided to get nipple piercings. So okay whatever I don't like them but you do and that's what matters in the end. But we recently got into a bit of a heated argument over it recently.

She wanted to go to a party.

She was going to go with a couple friends and we even went to the store to pick out a cute outfit for her. She looks great and I'm happy about that, but then she says she isn't going to go with a bra on. This upsets me quite a lot.

She says that she was going to show them off and I was completely not okay with it. She asks me, what is the point in having piercings/tattoos if you aren't going to show them off? I understand that. But I tell her that any guy in the entire room will be able to very clearly see your nipples and I was just not okay with that. And I'm certain she knows this is the case and may be part of the reason she wants to do it.

Now I realize this may sound controlling, but I really don't like the idea of her feeling like she wants to show off something for the purpose of getting guys attention. Again, I can't say for certain that this is what she is doing it for. But it will undoubtedly attract attention from guys and it's not just ""wow she's cute"" attention it's putting attention onto something that is sexual. And I just feel not okay with that.

**Now here's the important info.**

My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly four years. Middle of high school is when we started dating.

But, we somewhat mutually broke up for a few months than got back together and we've been back together for about five months now.

Because of some of the events that happened during the breakup, essentially all sexuality between us has died off. This is not because I don't want to, but because she gets very upset about it.

So I have been very deprived of this kind of stuff for awhile now, and I've grown a hatred that I can only assume is actually jealousy, for anything sexual

So I guess I could say that the reason I feel so angry about this, is that it seems to me that she is wanting to look sexy for other guys while her and I barely do anything together and when we do it usually ends up in us both getting very upset

So, AITA for not being okay with her wanting to show off her nipple piercings at a party?"		1	0

After an hour and a half  the order hadnt arrived yet, so I called to check on it and they told me that they were just about to leave, I was considering cancelling, but I was pretty hungry and didn't want to wait anymore. About 10 min later they call me and say that the driver must drive about 30 min just to get to me, so they would have to charge me 1,50  €  extra for the trip, stupidly I agreed. It took them another HOUR AND A HALF (overall 3h !!!) to get to me and whilst I was giving him the money, he just decided to keep the change and I told him to give it back, because I wasn't happy with the late delivery and extra cost, he snapped back at me saying, he had to drive a total of 1 hour just to deliver my food and I told him that if his restaurant had the correct delivery cost in the beginning I would've probably given him something, but I wasn't happy with how they treated me. He then gave me an awful look and slammed the lobby door. I told this story to a few people and they all seem to sympathize with the delivery man.

If you are unfamiliar with the story, please read above before moving on.

I was brought into a conference room yesterday just before closing with my boss and my boss's boss.  After we sat, my BB stated ""OP, we are going to let you go.""

I figured this was coming, so I just sat there and said ""Okay.""

Response, ""You underachieved on your goal and this caused us to come under budget this year.  You have been a great environmental addition (it is worth noting the person who had left was a bad culture person) but performance is what we are all held to so for that reason we need to go another direction.""

I said, ""Okay, and I thank you for the opportunity.  With that being said, I think this is a poor management decision.  I mentioned how the metric I was being judged against was not statistically feasible."" I then went into the stats provided by stealthdawg (TY) in my previous post to show them that.

""We all have to be responsible for our goals no matter what they are.  We were hoping that you would come into the last meeting and take the constructive criticism as a boost to help elevate your performance moving forward.  Instead, you made excuses on why the goals that were put in front of you were not hit, and deflected blame as to why you didn't achieve them.  Other reps goals should not be of your concern.  You did not take responsibility.  This is the reason you will no longer be employed here.""

Me- ""I really enjoyed every aspect of working here until this point, I think your expectations were unfair and I have pointed that out with statistical backing.  In brute honesty, telling someone you are reviewing their employment is not a motivational speech.  I would suggest trying a different approach with your reps in the future.

""In brute honesty (now sounding condescending), we tried being supportive, but as we did not get results, needed to try another method.  At the end of the day, you are the one who failed and your failure to own that is what is costing you this job.""

Me- ""I don't wish to be somewhere where I am not fairly evaluated or where I am not wanted.  I wish you the best""  as I get up to pack my things.

""Hold on, we want to discuss your clients as well as your leads/prospects.""

Me- ""With all due respect, I do not wish to do that as you have ended my employment""

""With ADR, those sales and leads are our property and you are required to give them.""

Me-""Everything is on my PC, I will leave you the password""

""That will not suffice, we need to walk through these all whether it be tonight or another day.""

Me-""No thank you, I am no longer employed here."" I try to walk out again.

""I would not expect to have a good review come from us if you are unwilling to do this""

Me - ""I was fired, I wouldn't expect a good review anyway""  I went to pack my things and left.

c5vwc5	2019-06-26 21:04:42	fogfogfogfogfogfog	AITA for not taking the kids to the pool when I promised I would?	"Kids are my son 5, stepson 11, nephew 10, and nephew 13.  My stepson is leaving to go back home to his moms tomorrow.  I promised them I would take them to the pool today after work once I saw to a few errands.

I stopped by my nephews' house and told them to meet me at my place we were going to get ready for the pool. (We can walk between homes.) They beat us home because we had to make a stop (maybe 5 minutes longer than they were).  We all go inside and my nephews grab the video game system and start playing while my Stepson Son and I got ready.  They all start fighting as I'm the last one ready and they can NOT play nicely on video games (my nephews bicker with each other and my boys get mad that they make everything take longer.). 

Anyway so while they are all fighting I hand them each towels, spray their little necks and cheeks with sub screen and tell them to grab a snack and a drink from the fridge.  As each one is sun blocked and has his snack the others go back to the game.  

Then I ask if they will help me load the trash in the car so we can stop at the dump before we get to the pool.  Nobody responds.

I tell them the car is ready and don't forget the towels.

They don't respond.

I say ""guys! Don't you want to go to the pool?""

A few affirmative grunts.

So I say well ""let's go then.""

They go back to the games like I don't exist.
So I am sitting in the car waiting for them. It's 5pm and I have shit to do.  Been ready to go since 4:30.   So I'm giving them another 10 minutes and then I guess I'll go on to the dump and then get the chores done early.

AITA for letting them screw themselves out of the pool when it would be pretty easy for me to just go inside and turn off the game and tell them to move their asses? I mean very little effort on my part would get them to the pool at this point.  But I just don't see why I should."	Asshole	0	0
c5vwbl	2019-06-26 21:04:41		AITA for getting annoyed at my boyfriend for asking me to get him new moving boxes?	"First of all: this is a throwaway because my bf is on reddit.

Second: I feel pretty sure that I’m the asshole here, but I just have this annoying feeling in my gut about the situation so I want to ask you guys. Thank you in advance for your advice 😊

We’re 22 and 23 and live in the same college dorm. We’ve been seeing each other for a year + a couple of months.

A year ago, very soon after we first met, my boyfriend lent me three moving boxes because I needed to move to a different room in the dorm. After I’d used them, I put them in our common room to store temporarily until I could give them back, but unfortunately they were stolen before I had the chance. I immediately told him that I’d get him new moving boxes.

Not once this past year has he mentioned that he wanted me to get him the new boxes until now, very shortly before he needs them.

Getting moving boxes is extremely inconvenient for me because there are no stores selling them nearby and I only have my bike to transport them on.

I think what annoys me is that this feels so impersonal. Like I’m just another person he’s calling in a favor of and not his girlfriend whose convenience I feel like he should take into consideration??? (Wow I really feel like I’m sounding crazy reading this through 🤦‍♀️) He knows I’m really busy these days and I KNOW he’s only asking me because he himself doesn’t want to go through the hassle of having to transport the boxes on his bike etc.

I already told him that I’d get him the boxes!! I’m fully aware that I borrowed something and didn’t return it, which means it’s my responsibility to replace it so don’t worry about that aspect of this lol

I just want to know if I’m crazy for getting so annoyed at him? It’s like - I can’t put my finger on why, but with me being his girlfriend, it just seems inconsiderate ???

Help me get my feelings in order haha! AITA?"		1	0

I've been trying to get as much time as I can to make the boss happy, but I've been feeling off. It's not like an awful sick, but yesterday for some reason the smells and amount of screaming children and parents, with a something else made me really sick. This never happens. I vomited, wiped it off and was sent home. I felt so bad for leaving them there, like I was unreliable. Two other people were sick yesterday, one being my boss and the other my supervisor. I came into day to work, still feeling okay to work but I ate lunch and couldn't keep it down. I didn't plan on telling them, but my coworker was concerned and turned me in so they sent me home and forced me to a doctor's appointment in the morning, cause when I mentioned pain up my side and not being able to keep down food for several days they flipped out, saying I couldn't come in till I went to the doctor. One got mad and said I was unreliable for this, and I already feel bad. I made a doctor's appointment, but I still feel like the asshole for having this happen.

c5vvix	2019-06-26 21:03:03	sirSkillzAhlot	AITA for not renting cars to rich entitled assholes who do not make reservations in advance?	"Long time lurker, first time poster.  

So, for a little context, I work as bookkeeper/office manger for a small car dealership that hosts a satellite branch for a national car rental chain.  Since I am the only one who works in the office I get the pleasure of dealing with the car rentals.  Since this is a rural area, we are the only car rental business within 80 miles.  We have a fairly small fleet of cars, typically between 12 and 15 vehicles.  We don’t usually have cars sitting on the lot without a reservation, occasionally we’ll have unexpected cars come in from other locations, but that is definitely not the norm.  

The area is also close to a very popular state park that sees over 2 million guests a year, that is to say we get a lot of tourists.  We have a small regional airport that sees quite a bit of traffic, especially during the summer.  I frequently deliver cars to the airport and have no problem doing so, with the appropriate amount of reservation time.  

So here’s where I might be an asshole.  I get calls at the last minute often and I’m usually pretty helpful and do everything in my power to get people into a car, but last Friday I get a call around 11am from a guy who wants me to deliver a car to the airport by 3pm.  I can tell by this guys tone and demeanor that he is a rich entitled prick and fully expects me to have a car waiting for him, so I said “I’m sorry sir, we don’t have any cars available today.”  Knowing full well we had a car sitting in the lot with no reservation on it.  He was PISSED and started yelling at me and asking me about other car rental companies.  I told him there were two other companies, 80 miles away, or he could use the airport courtesy car(now, I know that the airport courtesy car is a total piece of shit and apparently he did too) This sent him into a panicky rage, he kept saying “what am I supposed to to do now.”  I maintained that I didn’t have any cars and apologized.  He hung up on me in a very rude manner. 

I felt somewhat like an asshole, because I could have helped him, but he didn’t deserve it.  AITA?

Just as a side note, later in the day I rented the car to a nice lady that was in a car accident and was stranded."	Asshole	0	0

c5votb	2019-06-26 20:50:43		AITA for ditching an entitled old friend on a day out?	"So, I was friends with this girl when we first started secondary school, and she was quite annoying. She was entitled asf. I rolled with it until Year 9, when she left the school. 

Well, last Friday, me and a couple of my new friends went to a local café to get milkshakes and  I see EF (ex-friend) for the first time in years. I hug her, and get her number so we can talk. Me and my other friend, let’s refer to her as Pinky, had planned to go out to a bowling session on the Saturday, the day after, with another friend that wasn’t there. It was supposed to be just three of us. EF had found out, and invited herself. Me and Pinky were just sat there, shrugging, and we hesitantly agreed to it. We agreed prior to meet up at the bowling alley at 12 to get the tickets and play. We then go to our homes. EF had asked her mother and she had said no. Me and Pinky were relieved, as it was supposed to be our special day out with our other friend to celebrate that we had finished school. In addition, EF and out other friend haven’t even met. By 5am, EF had invited me and Pinky, and our other friend, to a Whatsapp group and constantly started messaging us. “My mum said I can come.” Was her main message. But she started spamming us with about 4 messages a minute. It was very annoying. She then was begging us to change the time from 12, a time me and my other friends agreed on days prior, to 2pm, because “i dont get up until 11am”. I told her, “No, we have agreed to meet up at 12, because that’s the time we established a few days ago.” We agreed on 12 because we live in a busy area, and people like to go bowling on Saturdays and so we had to get there early in order to get the chance to play. Plus, we were not willing to change our time because it would suit someone’s sleeping schedule better. So, after a group call with Pinky and my other friend, we agreed to go by ourselves and tell EF that we cancelled.

We go, and i take a picture of the results of bowling, which we each respectively put as our Whatsapp statuses. EF sees, and messages me. “Thanks for letting me know that you went.”

I couldn’t care at this point, and I just wanna enjoy my day with my true friends. So i told her I lied because she made us feel awkward. She then began to guilt trip me, telling me about her dead dog. My dogs died recently, and I have lost my grandparents, my cousins and my mother is dying. Yet she was using the dog that died 3 years ago as a way for me to feel sorry for her.

I told her that I didn’t care for her guilt tripping and we blocked her. She then contacted me on a different number saying “is that what real friends do?”

Tl;dr: A person I havent spoken to in 3 years invites herself to a special day out I planned for just me and my two best friends. She spams us and tries to change our times. we went without her, and lied to her, so she tried guilt tripping us and contacted us with different numbers."	Everyone Sucks	1	0

"Last week a couple I’m friends with asked me if I’d be willing to dog sit their two dogs for the next week. I was a bit surprised they asked me because we’re not *incredibly* close, but I used to dogsit pretty regularly for some neighbors, so I said yes. 

They offered to pay me $150 for seven days, which is much less than I usually made, but since they’re friends and I needed some money I accepted. 

I was supposed to come by their house last Wednesday to meet the dogs and learn how to care for them, but at the last minute my friends had to cancel for some reason. After that the earliest they could meet was Saturday night, only about one full day before I was supposed to start. 

This is where it got complicated. When I met them on Saturday they told me they expected me to stay overnight with their dogs while they were gone (on an air mattress). I hadn’t expected them to ask that *at all*; their house is almost an hour from the job I work til midnight on weekdays; and I was already making way less than my normal dog sitting price. 

I told them I was very sorry, but if they wanted me to sleep over they should have told me in advance and I would have declined, and since they were leaving in a day I’d still do it, BUT I raised my price to $350, i.e. $50 a day. Needless to say they were quite upset. 

According to them I should have known I’d be asked to stay overnight since that’s what all dog sitters do. They couldn’t afford $350 so we didn’t agree on anything. Luckily they found someone to take care of their dogs - not sure if they boarded them or got another dog sitter - and we haven’t talked since then. 

Obviously I made some mistakes and I’m hoping I didn’t ruin this friendship. I still feel bad about raising the price last minute, but AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5vj4z	2019-06-26 20:39:45	FormerWorking	WIBTA if I make my emergency money a loan, because my wife didn't bother contributing?	"I subscribe to the whole ""emergency fund"" I got from /r/personalfinance. Basically, I have about 6 months worth of living set aside in case I or my wife lose our jobs or if some sort of medical emergency happens. This also extends to both our families and siblings. Originally, we were both supposed to put money into the pot, and despite my attempts to tell her to ""save x"" money per month, trying to break down her expenses per month via a spreadsheet, and reminders in general, she's always been someone who never took her finances seriously.

&#x200B;

I was talking to her about it again and mentioned how important it is in case something bad were to happen. Not even just to us, but if her or my parents had to go through something, we could help them out in a pinch. She mentioned that we don't have to worry about the fund anymore, cause I have already saved up what we need. I felt like she was trying to use that argument in bad faith. I didn't say much after that, but it got me thinking about what I could do to work around her expectations of how this money is used.

&#x200B;

Originally, I thought about not using the money for her in-laws or other family in case something happened to them. But then I thought that if they really needed it, I shouldn't be punishing them, for something my wife was not being responsible for. At the same time, I feel like I am not letting her face any consequences for her refusal to listen to me. So the consensus I came in my head is that if someone on my side, me, or even my wife had something happen, I would use my money willingly. But if we needed to use that money for her parents or family, then I would have to treat it as a loan, legally signed and all.

&#x200B;

I already realize whatever I do that is basically not ""hand over the money"" when the time comes, then it will piss my wife off. But I feel like I'd become extremely resentful if I went down that route."	Asshole	0	0

WIBTA for telling a family to control their kid in a kids movie?

I am a big fan of going to the movies and I really enjoy all types of movies, but recently I have seen a problem with the movie going experience of one particular genre: kids movies. I was really excited for the new Toy Story movie but I knew that it would get ruined by kids talking when I went to see it at the theater. So in an effort to avoid as many kids as possible, I went to a 10:00 PM show on a Tuesday night at a Dolby Cinema screen, which is a more expensive ticket. I thought that I had checked all the boxes to avoid kids, but low and behold, there was a kid that was talking to his mom for the last 15 minutes of the film (ie. the emotional climax of the story) and the parents wouldn't take the kid out. On one hand, I see the argument that if you go to a kids movie, you should expect kids to be there and be making noise. But on the other hand, I paid for this movie  just the same as all the other people in this theater; why should they be allowed to ruin my experience? I made all efforts to go at a time where kids wouldn't be there, and since the employees won't police the theaters, it seems like the only way to have a good time at the movies is to police it yourself. However, I have politely tried to do this before and every time the parents have said that I have to deal with it because it's a kids movie and that's what I should expect, but I don't really buy into this argument. So my question is, WIBTA if I tell a family to control their kid in the kids movie?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"My aunts birthday is in July and I’m thinking of offering to take her dog to the vet for her birthday present. We aren’t super close but we live in the same small town near each other and see each other regularly and I know her dog well. Also, she is about my age because she’s a lot younger than my dad. 

Her dog who is only about five started losing all its hair and looking terrible like half a year ago. She said she was going to bring it to the vet but never did and now says she’s figured out what’s wrong and the dog is getting better, but I see no improvement. 

My aunt always is low on extra money so I think she never took the dog to the vet because of cost. So, I want to take it and thought this is a good opportunity to do it, but would it be rude and be assholeish to offer to take her pet to the vet? Especially as a bday present and when she insists she knows what the problem is and that it’s getting better? I know I’m not an asshole for wanting to help the dog; this is more about possibly offending my aunt or butting in when maybe it isn’t my business."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5veix	2019-06-26 20:31:20		AITA to decline my MILs invitation to go to her beach shed each year?	"So my MIL has a very small  shed she uses as a beach house. There’s literally one bed and a bathroom in it and some furniture out of it. But it’s at a private beach so shes so proud about it. Just clearing this up because it’s not an actual beach house. More like camping house on a beach. 
I am not the thinnest person on the planet. I am not fat, but chubby. MIL has a boyfriend who bodyshamed me in the past (and I had clothes on and was not in a bikini) and criticizes my  eating habits all the time. For example she asks me to cook a traditional dish for her, I do it and he asks me if I had gotten butter in it because is way to fat (it was only coconut milk but ok). 
Two years ago they had split up and mil invited us to go to this shed.
We went and had a nice time. Now they’re back together and she keeps inviting us. But I decline politely every time. Because 
1. I don’t want her bf to see me in a bikini because he will say something that will hurt my feelings.
2. she tends to invite random people to brag about it. I don’t want to expose myself in front of random strangers I don’t even know. 
3. I am getting annoyed of her bragging and constantly asking us to come even though we already told her we don’t enjoy it that much. 

She doesn’t stop. Every week she asks us to come and even though we said we would eventually come on a date she won’t have that many people over she keeps inviting strangers there when we are suppose to come.
So my husband said she invited us for Sunday and I asked if there’s someone else coming. He told me he doesn’t know but we should finally go so she tops nagging.
I told him I don’t feel comfortable. He said i should get over myself and do this favor for her because she won’t stop asking until we go. 

AITA to refuse to go under this circumstances? I told her I’ll got if she wants to spend some time with us, I’ll even go if her boyfriends there (didn’t told her that) but I’m not willing to walk around in a bikini in front of strangers and risk her bf bodyshaming me in front of strangers."		1	0

c5v8ik	2019-06-26 20:19:53	LunaNighthaven	AITA for trying to release myself from a friendship that was controlling my life?	"The title may seem overdramatic but for some context, the person I'm referring to did have a strong grip on my life. I had been in this friendship for 3 years (we're not friends anymore but the situation is bugging me) and I had given everything to hold it together. Long story short, my ""friend"" would assume I didn't want to be their friend if I didn't message them every day. Sometimes they would let a day or two slip but any longer and they would go on a small rant about how they didn't think I wanted to be their friend (I'm the type of person to take friendships as a ""I'm here if you need someone to talk to or entertain you"" rather than a constant visiting). 

To try and counter this situation I offered to meet up with them before school to walk with them on a morning (this caused us to be late in many cases) and I offered to stay round theirs after school for a minimum of an hour every day after school. This went well till it was the holidays and my mother took advantage of the time my brother and I were off school to take us out to places. You get the idea.

Now this person is in the year below me in school and my finals were coming up before I move to College. This was when I was trying to distance myself from them to revise and try and get a grip on my education in order to get into a decent college. They would often just show up at my house, uninvited and say that they were ""privelidged"" meaning they didn't need to be invited in. Then they began to take it out on me that I was getting distant (I went round every morning but didn't stay after school as I needed to get back and revise a bit). 

Skip forward a bit to their birthday where I spent an hour writing a heartfelt message saying that I loved them as a friend and subtly put it across that when I went into college I wouldn't be able to spend as much time with them. They didn't heed it  and threw out the card.

A round a month after that I told them outright the situation; I'm going into college and I won't be able to see them every day, also finals are coming up and I need to get my head down with work. Their response was ""Well we have a working laptop and decent internet."" 

My point wasn't the work I could do there but the fact I'm going into Law and Phsycology, would leave me with little time and I would really need to work hard in it. 

Either way they blew up about it a few weeks later and ended the friendship but I can't help but feel like the asshole by putting my education before my friendship."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5v56q	2019-06-26 20:13:43	FrostyWalker1998	WIBTA for reporting a large music festival near me and possibly getting it shut down?	"Largely generalized for the sake of anonymity, and obligatory mobile warning.

So where I live there is a very large music festival of about 50,000 people lasting two weeks, during those two weeks it is absolute hell to live there.

 I can’t even get out of my house to go to work, because the event security harasses me because I didn’t buy access to the event. I have had to get police involved 7 times in the last 5 years, once ending in a security guard attempting to taze me, and the only reason I wasn’t is because the actual officer drew a gun on him and had him arrested. (These guards are not real cops, they don’t have authority to do shit.)

I have a friend who is a police officer, and he says he has been denied entry into the festival before when somebody called 911 in the festival. 

Extremely loud music literally shaking my walls goes well into the early morning hours, past the legal times here.

Whenever I do manage to get out, getting back in is always way more hassle, either ending with more cops, or leaving to spend the night at a friends place.

So WIBTA for getting this festival shut down completely for these reasons?

Edit 1: referring to comments about permits, they likely do have permits for music, but not permits to lock me out of my home and point tazers at me. To the one comment about detours first of all shouldn’t make my life a pain in the ass and second, yes I am taking detours but checkpoints tend to not let people through without admission.

This problem has gotten a bit better over the years as most repeat workers know me, but the chances I see them are slim to none between different checkpoints and them not returning.

Edit 2: I did not make it clear that this event is currently going on.

I called and got up to the event planner for this, he claims that access passes have been sent to me for every year I have been here, I do not know if this is true or not, but he said if I don’t have them he can deactivate the bands and see who has them. If he has been sending passes, then they have been repeatedly stolen.

This may solve a large problem, but does not excuse the guard drawing on me and getting arrested, and denying emergency services. My best guess is that the festival does not take responsibility for these actions and the guards were blamed and charged for it.

I also asked around and security guards are actually volunteers that are paid with a 1-7 day pass varying between years. This would explain incompetent security. (These volunteers are just checkpoints checking for tickets, the actual event security that makes sure nobody tries to shoot up the place is further up the road from me, I never drove that way and wouldn’t have known.)

Edit 3: Well shit, guess I still had too many details in here, for those that guessed it yes, it is Electric Forest in WM. I was given a pass to get past the security, the ones I was supposed to get in the past years had apparently been repeatedly stolen by someone and I never knew about this."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5v1h1	2019-06-26 20:06:56	captain-wonderful	WIBTA if I withheld information from someone to help a friend?	"TL,DR: would it be mean to hold information from a super aggressive kid in order to help my friend? If I give the information, my friend would be subject to bullying, and if I don’t give the information then I would be the reason why one kid has less experience than his peers.

I have a friend (Pepper, for the sake of anonymity) who joined the track team. She’s overweight and is the slowest member by far, but she wants to become fit and she figured that she could join the no cut track team and lose fat. She’s a good person, but she cannot take bullying for the life of her. She will be entering sophomore year in high school. 

I am mentoring, in lack of a better word, an incoming freshman with anger issues. We can call him Andrew. He’s an outcast in my Scouts troop and I took him under my wing. We’ve had a number of conflicts (some of which I’ve ranted to Pepper about) because he gets on my nerves all the time. Most of these issues are caused by his destructive tendencies and his constant bullying of smaller/weaker/less confident individuals. Andrew wants to join the track team because he wants to prove to the world that he’s better than the authoritarians and “leaders” who never get off their high horses. 

Andrew is a bully and I am aware of that. Andrew is not aware of the Track Team Summer School Program, something that many wannabe track members do. If he wants to excel in his sport, it would be advantageous for him to participate during the summer. Pepper has self esteem issues and I don’t want to see her suffering. We’re like family. Having a bully on the team would hurt her. 

Although there are a number of questions that I would like answered, I believe there is a question that would give me all of the answers that I need; would I be the asshole if I withheld the information about the summer track team in order to help with Pepper’s self esteem?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"My boyfriend was checking his credit card statement recently and noticed a charge that he didn’t recognize.  It was from a company that he’s a customer of, but he hadn’t bought anything through them recently.  He called the company, and they were able to confirm that someone had created an account at their site and used his credit card number to make the purchase.  They closed the other account and said they would refund his money. They also advised that he reach out to his credit card company about the fraud. Easy enough, right?  Nope.  He then demanded that they give him the name/contact info of the other account.  The customer service rep he was speaking to refused to give him that info and said that company policy didn’t allow her to share that.  He got mad and started being really snippy with her, telling her that she was basically saying that a thief was more important to the company than an actual customer.  Once he confirmed that everything was settled, he hung up on her mid-sentence.  

I called him out for it, saying that he was really rude to her and that it wasn’t her fault that someone stole his card.  Why should she risk her job to go against company policy over $20?  He argued that even though it was only $20, this person obviously has his credit card number, so now he’s going to have to cancel that card and it’s a pain in the ass to do that.  He said that I was minimizing how big of a deal this is and that I wasn’t being supportive of him.  I know that the fraud itself is a big deal and that it’s not really “just $20,” but I still don’t think it was fair of him to speak to her that way.  I also brought up the fact that even if she had shared the info, there’s no guarantee it would be the person’s real name.  And if it was, what did he plan to do?  Track them down, bounty hunter style?  I said he was being ridiculous and he sort of just walked away.  I probably shouldn’t have called him ridiculous, but AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So basically we have a set group of wives/spouses for the office where our husbands work. We know each others personalities, we all have kids, involved in our churches etc. 

Okay so 4/5 months ago 2 newbies got transferred here. 1 guy, 1 girl. That same week we had a charity event I extended the invite to them the girl donated but didn't show, the guy + his wife did. My guy introduces me I liked the guy he seemed very GI Joe clean cut but the wife was...idk kind of like alt/gothy/punk. I make small talk and find out shes not religious (I invited her to church she declined) and child free (idk if thats by choice) but needless to say we didnt vibe. 

So bi weekly girls night comes up I invite new girl but not new wife. I figured I didn't vibe with her and this would give new girl a chance since she missed the event also It was a bowling and the numbers would've been odd. We had a great time and After that we kept the group as it was with the addition of new girl. This came up at a baby shower the last week when new girl asked wife why she never showed to girls nights. She said she didn't even know about it. It got awkward and someone changed subject to baby shower games wife wandered to her guy who was with all the other guys. They were talking guns apparently that's her ""thing"". I figured no harm no foul she found a group to join although it was weird since she was the only girl. 

Later in a group chat One girl asked why I was excluding wife my reasons were as follows: 

We have nothing in common with her
Our group dynamic was awesome as it is 
She Doesn't do church
Doesn't have kids
I pointed out in wasn't trying to be mean just practical.

We all have similar values where wife was pretty obviously on the other team as far as those go. 
New girl isn't married nor does she have kids but she's religious and all around fun. So its not like no babies means no friends but friendship means similar values/ideas etc. 

One of the wives told her guy about the group chat and he invited the couple to a group cookout on Friday. He also told my husband who said I was mean girling and how this would make office interactions awkward as theyre a team. He mentioned her guy has been pretty closed mouthed about outside office stuff and now he gets why he (my guy) was pretty upset. He said he felt like a jackass and He also said he liked her and that if we gave her a chance we would too. My friends are saying they are gonna try and include her in convos to be nice and I'm all for it but said girls nights were still exclusive until we can all discuss it. I don't think wife cares honestly no one has said anything more about it. AITA for keeping an eye out for everyone?"	Asshole	0	0

We go a lot of places, and I genuinely enjoy going places with him. He has been solo parenting for about two years now. My sister is a vegetarian, which kind of changes a lot of places that we could go to eat and makes finding a place to eat more difficult. I'm fine with her dietary choice, but it does sort of frustrate me that a lot of good places to eat are ruled out just by this. My sister also complains a lot about being tired and the like, which stresses my dad out which in turn stresses me out. I just don't really enjoy travelling with my sister that much. Anyways, later on the trip, my dad and I were talking without my sister and I told him that I don't think I will take another trip with my sister for a while. He said that that was fine and I thought that was that. But then he asked me if I wanted to go on another trip in front of my sister, knowing what I thought. I reiterated that I didn't want to go on another trip with my sister for a while.

Later, in the hotel room, my sister asked me about it and I told her my rationale for it, and she got mad at me. She said that travelling was one of the big things we do as a family. Then, after a bit of talking, my dad dropped into the conversation and said that it was obvious that I was just running away from the family and that it was fine. Fuck him for that.

He's started eating some foods but mostly just tastes of porridge and fruit and veg etc.

For context, my partner is a meat eater and I'm a vegetarian. I like to think I'm not militant, I don't try to persuade anyone to go veggie. You do you. 

My partner and I had a conversation today about our son progressing to bigger meals. I mentioned that I probably wouldn't be buying meat or products with meat in for him but I have no problem with my partner doing so if he wishes. 

My partner questioned me about this as he feels that I would be encouraging vegetarianism upon our son. He thinks I shouldn't go out of my way to avoid meat and that he needs the nutrients and choice.

From my point of view I'd still be giving my son a varied, nutritional diet - I've done some research and there doesn't seem to be any impact on a child being a full vegetarian, let alone one that would still sometimes have meat. If I'll be cooking meals for myself, it just makes sense for my son to have them too and he can also sometimes have meals with his dad which probably include meat. 

He's too young at this stage to be able to choose which diet to follow or to understand why people do/don't eat meat so why would I go out of my way to encourage meat now? 

If, when he is old enough to choose, he would like to eat meat then I'm absolutely fine with that and will purchase/prepare whatever he likes.

Part 1. See Comments.

&#x200B;

My soon to be sister-in-law and brother began dating over 3 years ago - nearly around the same time as my boyfriend and I. Looking back, my brother has made (mostly) questionable decisions in his dating life. As close as our family is, we had no relationship with his previous girlfriend. Before that, he dated a girl for 4 years and she was very involved and loved by all of us. Unfortunately, he cheated and that relationship ended. We have all remained friends with her on social media and I talk to her more than I talk to his fiance. My sister is married and I (and the rest of my family) have always had a great relationship with my brother-in-law.

&#x200B;

\*\*Changing names for privacy purposes. Fiance=Sarah.. Brother=Will\*\*

&#x200B;

When Will and Sarah began dating, everything started off fine. When we first met, she seemed a little bit uptight and serious. I figured she might be nervous and would loosen up/warm up to us with time.. but I was wrong. As time progressed, her tense nature didn't seem to go away. Instead, her true colors slowly began to show. At the time, I was in college, and Will and Sarah lived in the same town. I figured we should get together over a few drinks downtown as a way to bond and get to know each other better. After the first couple of invites, whether it be a casual dinner or drinks, Sarah didn't show up. She would instead go out with her friends and Will would come alone to meet up with my boyfriend and I. She even did this on my birthday. Finally, we all ended up together downtown, and she had a friend with her. She didn't even introduce us and acted very stand-offish toward me.. mainly talking to her friend and my brother and even whispering in their ear at times. After a couple of bars and several drinks later, I had decided to go home. My brother wanted us to stay out, but payday wasn't until next week for me and I wanted to stay within my budget. I can vividly recall Sarah and her friend laughing, mocking me, and rolling their eyes in my face and saying what? You can't afford to drink? I was a sophomore in college working unpaid internship and an hourly part-time job. Give me a break. Even if you felt that way, keep it to yourself. We had already gone to several bars and I wasn't trying to drop hundreds of dollars downtown. That was red flag #1."		1	0

c5ut29	2019-06-26 19:51:18	HronkChaos	AITA for asking my parents to walk my brother's dog while I'm at work/doing my own things?	"Year 2009, my older brother (20) buys a dog because he wanted a boxer. Back then, we already had an old lady that would die roughly 3 years after, that was with me since I (15 in 2009) was 4yo.

&#x200B;

Shortly after he bought the dog, he joined the military and I was asked by my parents to walk the boxer, along with our other dog, while my brother was working. Fortunately, the training camp was near our house, so he'd be here after lunch time.  A few months pass and my brother has to leave our city and live around 1000km away and he couldn't keep the dog with him.

&#x200B;

Then I become his whole owner. This infuriated me a lot, since I had more than enough with my old dog and I've never wanted the responsability of being an owner. My father is a cooker, who works almost 12h every day and mom suffers from fibromyalgia.

&#x200B;

July 2012, my old lady dies from cancer and I have never to make two walks, one for her and one for him. I was 17 at the time and I was finishing my studies, before entering university.  Like every teenager, I liked to go out at night, come back late ... I could not. If I did, regardless of the time I returned, I had to get up around 9 in the morning to walk the dog. I have to say that the dog goes out every 4h.

&#x200B;

You can imagine that this has crippled a lot my social life. I """"can't"""" be out more than 4 hours, so I've spent most of the weekends at home, playing videogames or whatever.

&#x200B;

Year 2016, my father gives me a job with him near home as he talks with his boss and I start to work with them. I had to go out my job to walk him around 12 am and return to my job, walk him again around 17 when I got home with dad, going out again at 19 and around 12 pm when I came home again from work. Absolute madness. I left the job before summer and started to study again.

&#x200B;

3 years later, I'm finally working at my field and I have two shifts, from 8-12 and 16-20, Everytime I come home I have to walk a dog that isn't mine. It doesn't matter if I want to go to the gym or whatever, the dog is always over any of my choices."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5upsz	2019-06-26 19:45:02		AITA for not wanting to drink when you go camping with friends this weekend?	"My girlfriend was upset when I told her that I wouldn't be drinking all that much this weekend because I don't really have money to pitch in on it and she knows I don't like drinking in public anyways. I'll have a few beers at home or a couple cocktails but I rarely gets hammered. This all came up when I told her, I'm only gonna do our shrooms (half 8th for each of us not a whole one) and that I know there is gonna be coke at their and I didnt wanna do any. She replied with, you're gonna drink right? To which I said I'll have a couple but I dont wanna get drunk with people I dont know (her co workers). She got upset and went on to say that she wants a boyfriend who other girls will be jealous of and not say ""what's wrong with him?"" I told her she was being superficial. She said that she didn't like getting fucked up either but she wants friends and I was in awe at how she didn't see how that was social pressure and very superficial. 

I little backstory too, my dad was an alcoholic and abused myself, my brother, and my mom. My girlfriend knows this is the main reason I dont drink for I have seen what it does to people when they have had too much. I never want to make a fool of myself via drinking and I HATE not have control over myself. I feel like it's the socially right thing to drink with them but my personal values (couldn't think of another word) are telling me just go and be comfortable. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c5uozk	2019-06-26 19:43:28	Fair_Selection	AITA For venting to my close friends that some of my other friends potentially hate me?	"I took a 3 month long class with a bunch of my friends. We practically know each other, some are close together some arent that close. In the class we had a final project, I unintentionally did something similar to a classmate and close friend, let's call him A. Personally I didn't find it to be that big of a deal, but not for A. He reaches out to me on FB and we have a talk, basically how A thinks that what I'm doing is bad if I actually happen to enter the workforce and how I need to have original ideas and stuff, and that A feels hurt that I did something similar to him. I explained to him as best as I could that, yes I did do something similar to him but it was all unintentional and I came up with the idea myself, independently. I thought that was the end of it, we came to a mutual understanding, and thought nothing more of the situation.

&#x200B;

Well, after the class ended we have a day trip together, and during that trip I get a really bad gut feeling from A and his roommate B who he is close with. Like they hate me and were avoiding me. I had the feeling they hated me because of the whole situation involving the similar project.

&#x200B;

So after the trip I was carpooling with another member of the group back home and I told him about this whole situation, how I'm getting this bad gut feeling that they hated me. He says, yeah those two are close, and B LOVES to talk shit, especially when she's drunk. She is known to be very gossipy and likes to talk shit. But that's all the info I get.

&#x200B;

Two weeks later I am travelling overseas with A and B's roommate C. So one time in the hotel I ask C about his honest opinion about me and what I can improve upon, since C also took the class with me. Well, C gave me his honest feedback which is kinda hard to hear but I accept it anyway. He says people think you ask stupid questions, and you should really ask your questions in a smarter way. I make note of that for next time. He says A and B are really close and how B (the girl) has poisoned A to hate me and told A to distance himself away from me. That actually hurt me because I was close with A before and thought the whole situation with A was pretty much squared off. But, A also defended me during the times when people would talk shit about me.

&#x200B;

Now I have yet to talk to A again about this whole thing. I don't know if he actually hates me or not, but I have seen him again in a group party and he sort of avoided me and I still get a really bad gut feeling. So I just let it go, part of me wants to know but then again why would I try and be friends with someone who sided against me and actively hates me?

&#x200B;

I've since vented to two other close friends about this whole situation. This is where I'm dubious. Am I the asshole for gossiping about this whole situation instead of talking directly to the people who I think hate me? We all know each other and I know gossip hurts, so idk."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Its honestly a pretty big situation but also its been blown up alot. So there is 4 of us (me my bf and our 2 friends that are dating) and they were all hanging out while i was camping with my family and something big went down with my stepmom so i called them and told them that i wasnt like okay at all. They were too busy chasing and ice cream lady that called my friend dumb to report her. And i get that like she was there and you guys were with here while i was away so it was easier to take care of. Then my other friend checked in on me and i posted on my ig about it and that made my bf upset, like really upset. But i didn't know that so i was acting like everything is okay and then my friend that got upset told me that i made him mad. So i called him and apologized and asked him if he was okay and he said that it kinda upset him and it was okay and that he was fine. Everything sounds good right? Wrong. Now comes monday the day before i have to leave and a day they had said they could come down well he was hanging with our friends before the guy friend has to go home and thats okay. I texted bf and said just come after you drop him off if you want and then i got upset so i told him that too and he said that he had something to go to. Thats fine ill just go with him i thought. Nope he said i doth think thats the best idea and the dumb kid told me he would see me the next day, the day i am leaving. I told him he couldn't cause im leaving and that i would see him in 10 days and then apologized for saying that. He hasnt said anything to me at all. Then my  girl friend( ice cream one) told me that he got reallly mad about the ig post so again i apologized a whole lot more and still no answer. I told him that we need to communicate, no answer but he saw it and left me on read. I told him how i dont know what to do anymore if he doesn't answer bc i am not doing well, im stress sick and crying and hes hanging out with our friends not talking to me at all."		1	0
c5umy4	2019-06-26 19:39:37	ThrowawayAITA590	AITA for pushing my son to perform on the SAT?	"Background: My son is 16 and it is crunch time to get a good sat score. He is set on going into software engineering or something in close to it.

Last year, he took half the sats that were available. After the first exam I told him that he had some work to do. It was simply not good enough for the colleges he was looking at. I trusted him to up his game and I didn't remove any privileges and let him go out and do normal teenager stuff. Every week I would ask him to show me what he was doing to improve his SAT score. He would show me a the practice he was doing. By March he was scoring in the 1500's consistently on the practice exams. However, he got a 1200 on the test that he took in march. He blamed it on nerves and that was the end of it.

That brings us to last week. He was in the middle of one of his study sessions and told me not to come in to his room when I knocked. I had brought him a mango milkshake that I had just made so I wasn't going to step away. I go into his room with the intention of dropping the food and leaving with maximum stealth not to disturb him. When I open the door, he quickly alt-tabs on his PC and pretends to be working. I ask him what the hell is he up to and he responds with some obvious bs. I ask to see his PC and he reluctantly grants me permission. I just go to the other tab and he has the answer key for the test he was taking pulled up. There was 0 work for any of the questions and he had just circled the right answer. Then everything clicked. He has been faking studying this whole time. I was offended and told him that he has to study in the living room until the next SAT. I brought his PC downstairs and put a limit on his leisure time. My wife has said that this is putting too much pressure and we should trust our son. I responded with the fact that we trusted him and he broke that trust. He can still play games, go out with friends, invite people over etc. He will just be forced to study properly for his upcoming exam. My wife's family thinks that I am putting too much pressure on him to go to college and ""it's just some silly test"". I responded with the fact that he has ambitions to go to a top college, and the SAT seems like his only obstacle. He has top grades, he is involved in robotics, and competitive programming clubs and volunteers occasionally. My FIL and BIL found out and said that he needed more freedom and alternative options. They are not the biggest fans of college and feel that I am shoving college down his throat. They are now in my face about this issue and demand that I let him explore alternative paths and stop prioritizing ""bs tests"" so much.

I was always weird about adopting cats out to people with children. But I saw a video of a 9-10 year old boy who was repeatedly opening and closing the door on a cats tail and laughing about it. I now feel completely uncomfortable adopting out cats to people with children.

Very much aware adults can do the same thing but it's easy to go through a profile/posting history of a couple without children or a single man/woman.  I get the gist of their personality and who they are and can take the vibe I'm getting into consideration, I can actually communicate with them. But with kids there is no way to get reassurance. 

I feel a bit guilty as I know all kids aren't horrible. Am I an asshole for having this mindset? If I'm completely in the wrong do you have any advice on how to fix my flawed thinking?"	No A-holes here	1	0
c5uly6	2019-06-26 19:37:51	Tellbrosgf	WIBTA if I told my brother's girlfriend what he's been saying behind her back?	"My brother started dating a friend of mine, Kate, a  few months ago. Lately, my brother has been telling me and other people that his relationship is in bad shape. He says that Kate is very controlling of him. Normally, I'd feel bad for him, but I'm suspicious that my brother is not telling the whole truth and that Kate isn't actually that bad.

My brother claims that Kate will do things like make him change his clothes to something she likes or she will refuse to go out with him. If they are supposed to go to an event, she will tell him he's not invited anymore unless he changes his clothes. My brother complains that she controls his speech, and has told him a list of topics that he is not allowed to discuss when she brings him to meet people. Once, he decided to discuss one of the forbidden topics anyway, and Kate took him outside, yelled at him, and made him leave the party because he disobeyed her.

This all sounds terrible, but I suspect that my brother is embellishing to make himself look innocent. I know my brother well, and he often dresses like a slob. I think there's a good chance that Kate refused to go out with him because his clothes were actually inappropriate, not just because she didn't personally like them. My brother is also a loudmouth who doesn't filter what he says, so I think there's a good chance that he has been saying rude things to Kate's friends. When my brother tells me these stories, he has been very evasive about what he was wearing and saying, which makes me not believe him. I didn't say anything because I only had vague suspicions that something wasn't right.

Something just happened that made my suspicions stronger. My brother told me he was getting nervous about Kate. According to him, Kate had a stupid argument with a friend of hers, Steve. Kate decided she didn't want Steve around anymore, so she went on a ""hate campaign"" and made her whole friend group to drop him, and even got Steve's future roommates to tell him he couldn't sign a lease with them anymore, leaving him homeless unless he finds a new place quickly. My brother is afraid she will do the same thing to him if they have an argument.

I found out that Steve had been harassing Kate, and it was pretty serious, not a stupid argument like my brother claimed. The friend group ditched Steve because they didn't want him around anymore, not because Kate went on a ""hate campaign"" against an innocent guy. My brother must know the full story, there's no reason why Kate would hold back any info from him when leaving it out would only make her look bad, which means my brother is lying to me to make Kate look worse.

I'm not sure if I should tell Kate what my brother has been saying about her. We are friends, but not close ones so I don't know if it would make me TA if I got involved. I do feel really sorry for her because a lot of people now think she's controlling and horrible, when most likely my brother is lying."	Asshole	0	0

It is the summer where I live so I had my doubts about the severity of what it was, I thought maybe a cold or allergies, but if it was the flu I was vaccinated anyways. We had a short conversation about how she never get vaccines for flu and didn’t want to be near my boyfriend if he was sick and we both left for work. Later that evening she was hungry and my boyfriend had texted me saying he had made too much food for dinner and if no one minded since he was feeling under the weather, he had plenty to share with me and my friends. I invited my friend along with me (in retrospect I wish I just had not invited her but she was hungry and there was not enough ingredients to cook dinner with, it was late at night, my boyfriend is a great cook and I figured she just would not say yes if she did not want to be around someone who was sick, I had just told her he was probably sick just this morning) and when we got to his house, the topic came up that he had a stuffy nose and was probably sick. My friend became visibly uncomfortable, debated staying for dinner and repeated how she did not get vaccinated for the flu and did not want to get sick, and I didn’t force her to stay (of course) and took her home right away because she was clearly uneasy about it. When we got back to my house she was extremely mad at me and told me I couldn’t expect her to remember details I told her in the morning (about him being sick) and that I should have reminded her because she never would have come with me. I felt awful and I tried helping her find something to make for dinner in the house (there was not much to cook with, which is why I extended the invitation for dinner at my boyfriends) and she snapped at me and asked me if I was mad at her and that she didn’t want to eat what I was suggesting (I wasn’t at all I was just trying to be helpful) and I apologized for not communicating well enough earlier, defended that I had told her he was sick in the morning but backed off of that argument quickly because it was not really worth it, and left her alone to cool off and went back to my boyfriends, because I felt rude for leaving so abruptly and because I wanted to be around someone that was not angry at me. The whole thing was very dramatic for what was I think something small, and I got her out of the situation right away when I saw she was uncomfortable but later that night when I got back to my boyfriends I broke down and started crying because of how horrible I felt.

c5ukg3	2019-06-26 19:35:11		AITA for taking my brother’s iPhone and iPad after he repeatedly woke me up in the morning	"I come from a somewhat well off family. All year except the summer months we live in very spaced out quarters where we can be loud as possible with our electronics and not bother the rest of the family.

Over the summer months we stay in a place that’s smaller than what we’re used to. Myself (17) and my brother, Luke (13) share a room.


Luke is very into the YouTube channel of the SideMen. They do challenges and play games with eachother. One of the members of the SideMen has the most god-awful laugh I’ve heard. It’s high pitched and it sounds like a very fast, repeating screech. And this guy laughs a lot. Luke owns a pair of AirPods. 


We’ve been in our vacation place for about a week so we’re adjusted to everything except Luke refuses to m lower the volume of his iPad/iPhone or use his headphones. It began the first 2 days, I asked him to lower it and he did. It was still loud enough for me to hear it through my headphones.  I’d ask him to put in his AirPods he’d say he doesn’t know where they are. The AirPods are in a bag sitting on the side of bed. A few days after that I would got up, took the AirPods from his bag he took them.


I work at a popular night club with my friend. I work from 9 pm to 4 am. Normally I sleep from 5 am until  2 pm and head to the beach. I am a very light sleeper.


I work any day of the week if I’m called in. I had to work Sunday and Monday. I get home around 5:30 that night. Monday morning. I awake by the screeching laughs of the SideMen. It’s was 10 am. I yell at Luke to lower it. I try to get any sleep but I can’t because he refuses to leave the room or put on headphones. I left my room at 12 after laying in bed with my eyes open for 2 hours. I tried to get any rest but couldn’t. 

 
I pleaded with him to use headphones or leave the room while I am sleeping. And he said he’ll make sure it’s low. I didn’t feel like arguing so I let it be. I let my mom know and she agreed that he needs to lower the volume.


I have work tonight. At 9 am I once again wake up to the screeching laughs of that guy on Luke’s iPad. I bolt up yell at him to shut it off, he says “It’s not even loud.” I say “yes it fucking is, leave the room” He refuses and says that “I’m bitching.” The iPad is only able to connect to WiFi . I’m able to have access to the WiFi we use and banned his iPad from the network. He went on his phone and pulled up the same video at a louder volume. Since that has cell service I can’t ban it from the WiFi. I got out of my bed, grabbed it, and placed it on the highest shelf we had, then fell back to sleep. 


I woke up at 12 and my mom made me get the phone from the shelf. My mom told me I was way out of line and that I should have let her handle it. I told her I already complained to her about it and nothing changed and she said not to do that again. She does not know about the iPad being banned from the network and I plan to keep it banned for a few more days until I feel he’s learned a bit.

c5uivj	2019-06-26 19:32:24	TimeCustard	AITA for revealing details about my sex life to my mother?	"My parents divorced when I was a toddler, and throughout my childhood I had very little contact with my father, and then only through other family members. My mother eventually told me that my father had been increasingly violent since before they were even married, but she finally left him after he threatened to kill her and me if he found out she had spoken to other men while she was at work. Because of this, my mother has always been very ""sensitive"" to domestic violence. I don't mean that in a negative or dismissive way, just that she frequently pays more attentions to the signs than I imagine someone who didn't go through that would do, and she's lost a few friends over it.

I have been with my wife for five years, married for two. From the beginning of our relationship, we've both been very interested in what I guess you would call BDSM. Neither of us had ever done anything in that direction before, but my wife wanted to be submissive, and I was willing to try. As it turns out, we both enjoy it, and it has gradually seeped outside of the bedroom. We certainly don't go as far as one of those YouTube videos with people who have their partners on a lead in public, but my wife likes to be ""punished"" and I am more than happy to oblige.

About a week ago, I was chasing my wife around the house so I could ""punish"" her (my wife and I are very playful and she was laughing and I was letting her get away). She ended up tripping and hitting her forehead on the banister, but she was fine and we laughed about it after she had an ice pack and a cup of tea.

That brings us to yesterday, when my wife had lunch with my mother. Obviously she noticed the quite impressive bruise on my wife's forehead and asked about it, and my wife told her the truth, that she'd tripped on the stairs. She must have looked embarrassed or something, because my mother immediately jumped to me being responsible. My wife tried to convince her otherwise, but she's always been a terrible liar, and technically it was my fault.

My mother called me after I got home from work and pretty much screamed at me for twenty minutes, asking me how I could do this after everything she went through and saying she thought she'd raised me better than that. I tried to explain that it had actually been an accident and that I'd never hurt my wife, but she said she'd heard it all before.

At this point, I was quite upset, because I thought my mother knew me better than that, and she wouldn't give me a chance to explain myself. I'm not proud of it, but I shouted over her that what happened to her didn't stop me and my wife having sex how we wanted, and it wasn't any of her business. I put down the phone and told my wife what happened, and she is very much of the opinion that I was in the wrong for what I said. She called my mother later and explained, but she obviously found it very awkward and would have preferred not to have to. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Ex= my ex
Exf= my ex's innocent friend

So, at the start of the summer F goes on a vacation to India for a week. He says he won't bring his phone and that he'll call me once he's back.
2 days into his vacation that should last a week, F texts me using a new number, saying that he is using his friend's phone. I asked where he was, how he was doing, etc. He said that he was just hanging out at home. Remember he's supposed to be in India right now. So I'm immediately suspicious.
It takes me about 30 minutes of feigning small talk 2 figure out that F's ""friend"" is probably my ex trying to stalk me(or something) One big thing that was said was that F said he got back together with HIS ex, who just so happens to be exf.
So I call exf to confirm this, and she sounds like she's lying, even over the phone. So I played along for a few days, until it was time for F to come home. I decided to give F's ""friend"" a call. No less than 5 minutes after that call ended, exf started ranting about how she was sorry that she'd helped ex and that now she hated her and so on, and I feel pretty bad because of how I played along.

I’ve never seen him put any interest in getting a fish so I thought it was an odd gift, but whatever.  For months he’s been keeping it in a container slightly bigger than a vase with no filter, also thought that was weird, but again whatever.
          The next few months i’d been noticing him taking less and less care of it, going weeks without changing it’s water and not feeding it for days (i’m so surprised it’s still alive after about 6 months of this).  The tank would get so nasty that it would have a thick layer of slime across the top of the water and coating the plastic plant that’s inside of it.  He would only decide to clean it after i would give him shit for a couple days about the fish dying.
           Recently the situation has changed even more, the school year has ended and he’s basically moved back home, only coming back to the house for day or two these past 2 months.  A few days ago he asked me to take a picture of the diploma that he left in his room, so i did.  On the way out i notice the fish is still there and start to get a little mad.  It’s been two weeks since he’s been home and even longer since anyone’s done maintenance on the tank.  Half the water has evaporated from the tank and so much food/shit is piled up on the bottom of the tank that for a moment i thought it was the fishes body, but there were multiple piles.
           So this is where I need a second opinion, while at pet smart looking for supplies for my fish, i see a dead beta on the shelf that looks identical to his and that gave me an idea.  Basically i want to put the dead fish in the filthy tank and send him a picture of it telling him it had died.  Then give his fish back to the store where it wont die from neglect.  Would i be the asshole if i did this?

Edit:  my plan to get it back into the store was to take the container that the dead store fish is in, put his neglected fish in it (with clean water) and just put it back on the shelf myself.  I asked it if could have the dead one when i bought my supplies and the lady said sure (i realize i probably look crazy for this request) without scanning it, so there’s a good chance they won’t notice the change and it’ll be bought by someone else.

Another edit:  alternate solutions are appreciated, i already have an axolotl so i can’t take it and nobody is up at my school that would."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Things were clicking, they didn’t have their age listed so I asked, they said 19. So usually I prefer older, but I mean, 19 and 31 are both adults.    It’s also more common in the gay community to have a big age difference.  I probably wouldn’t date a 19 year old girl because I feel that is bordering on predatory, but with guys I feel it’s different. Still, I’m a little reserved.  I tell this person but they assure me they are “of legal age”

Anyhow, so I end up meeting this person at Applebee’s.  However, they do feel quite young to me.  As in like..... there’s a chance they lied about their age.  They act like an adult, but they look even younger in person.  I try to casually bring up seeing their ID with commenting how bad my ID picture is, which it’s laughabley awful.   I ask to see there’s, and he refused. Which is odd to me.  I basically come clean and say something along the lines of “hey, I just wanna make sure I’m not being like catfishes by a highschool student, I can’t be going to jail for dating a minor”.  Things kinda got awkward after that.  He texts me later and I just hold firm that I would feel a lot better seeing proof of their age.  His response was along the lines of “well if you wanna be an asshole and not trust me over this, then I don’t think it’s gonna work”



So a few things, One, am I an asshole for asking for an ID?  Two, am I being paranoid and should just believe then?  3, could I have brought this up better or what?"		1	0

c5uau2	2019-06-26 19:17:54	StarkyStark0	WIBTA for calling my mom out for sleeping with someone younger than me while I'm visiting?	"Obligatory apologies for long time lurking and being on mobile. 

Backstory, I moved out of moms house because her live in boyfriend was obnoxious, mom was a petty and mean drink and I was horrifically uncomfortable hearing them have sex every night. This put a huge dent in our relationship. 

This led me to a job that moved me across the country where I matured greatly, met my husband, settled down quite happily. I'm healthier mentally and emotionally. All of this, along with work being a huge excuse, meant I havent been home for 5 years. I became the lone wolf of the family.

So this week I decided it was time to come home. My husband wasn't able to come so it's already difficult for the both of us along with my added anxiety over staying with my mother and grandmother who was visiting as well. I was a big ball of nerves, they were good at tearing someone down.

The first few days go well. I set up on the couch downstairs, I introduce them to a new show, we drink and reminisce. Good times were had all around. But the 4th night was when my mother decided to introduce me to this 20 year old guy we'll call ""Jay"". He lives nearby in the city and he and mother bonded over the dog park dogs. When she spoke of him, it was made quite clear that he was just a ""cute boy next door "". Nothing was going on and so I simply saw him as such. 

He came over and we drank and told stories. My mother got sloppy drunk which was when I left to go to bed. I remembered the verbal abuse clearly whenever she got like this. I was jumpy and anxious. Just because I was an adult now with a family doesn't mean my family allows me that. 

Anyway, I went to bed at 11PM. At 2AM I heard them come in and go to her bedroom. I could hear everything. They were on the 1st floor and I was on the 2nd through 2 closed doors and still. I was horrified. I couldn't sleep, I didnt have a vehicle to escape and the area around her house wasnt safe to walk around at that hour. I called my husband while he was at work and just raged. He told me to say something but I can't even put into words WHY I'm enraged and disgusted. With my mother, without a proper argument you have no leg to stand on. This went on until 6AM where I finally lost my mind and slammed my palm on the wall until they realized I was protested and Jay quickly left in embarrassment. Which might have been funny in any other situation as I was older than him and clearly upset.

This morning I was cold and distant so she simply ignored me. I do everything I can to avoid her without ruining the next 5 days. My husband said that when he comes with me next time (I refuse to go alone after this) that we will be staying in a hotel which will be a huge slap to the face.

c5uasz	2019-06-26 19:17:51		AITA for pushing my friend to look for another job	So one of my friends has a part-time job in food service. I work food service too so I understand the frustration and the stress it causes, however she is always talking about how exhausted she is because this job wears her out so much. My friends and I have encouraged her to look for other jobs in the past, and she did quit her job once only to go work for the same chain at a different location. She told us that she has the same problems here that she had at the previous store. Once again, after she rants about it we asked her to look for another job. She says she’s ‘too tired’ or ‘too sad’ to job search and at first I left it alone because I completely understood, but then it started feeling like a repetitive excuse. I asked her to look for another job after she ranted once again and after giving me the same response I told her that I wasn’t going to listen about the store anymore if she wasn’t going to do anything about it. She talked about an internship she wanted to apply for and I encouraged her to do that, but to also apply for other jobs as a plan B because I wanted her out of that store just as much as she was telling me she wanted to. This was a month ago, she applied for the internship she had been talking about and I’m proud of her for doing that, and I left it alone until now when I found out she has to work July 4th. When I asked her about it, she said she hasn’t heard anything about  the internship and when I asked her about the other jobs she said she applied for, she ignored me for almost two days until I messaged her again. Turns out she hadn’t been applying for other jobs and has only been telling me she has. I know I’m pushy but knowing my friend, I feel like she needs someone to be pushy about it. She told me she knows she’s a procrastinator and I feel like when she is convincing herself that she’ll find another job, it helps her get through her shifts. I tell her that she has to put in the effort herself, but I feel like a bitch for saying it. I don’t want to feel like I’m bullying her. I care about her. I wanted Reddit’s response to this.		1	0
c5uaa0	2019-06-26 19:16:54	Potentialfriend96	WIBTA if i told my coworker to stop talking?	"I am currently at a work trip with a guy from my job(will call him W). W and i started at the same job at the exact same position about 2 weeks ago and so far we have been getting along fine. W has the same interests as me, same age and is a very caring and outgoing person.
The position we are in requires us to travel together alot which means staying at the same hotels and stuff which hasnt been a problem untill now.

As i mentioned earlier W is very outgoing and by that i mean he is extrovert like a mf, i on the other hand am pretty introvert and like my space.

Im not sure but i would say that im 80% certain W has adhd since he doesnt seem to have an off switch and talks constantly and so far it hasnt bothered me but today i feel exhousted. We flew to a new country today and we stay at the same hotel and from the moment we met up he has NOT STOPPED TALKING. I kid you not every single observational thought that goes through W mind has been said to me and the worst part is that he expects some kind of answer to every single comment he throws out. 
The things he says are like ""damn that girl is hot"", ""its so hot outside"" and ""look at this look at that"".

I cant take it anymore and it feels like i am going to expload, he has constantly been draining my social battery since we landed. Right now i have locked myself into my hotel room so that i dont have to talk to him but he is getting increasingly concerned to why i am not talking with him as i normally do and i dont know what to say. He says stuff like ""are you tired?"" and ""are you mad?"" all the time and i feel bad for not being as energetic as he wants me to be but he doesnt seem to notice that he never stops talking.

This is the first of 8 hard long days of work and since i only know him here i am wondering if i should just tell him that he needs to talk a bit less if he wants me to engage in activities, not sure how this is going to work otherwise. The only thing that has stopped me from saying it is that since the things he is saying is harmless i feel like it would be a dick move of me to tell him to talk less, would it?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c5u8p6	2019-06-26 19:14:11	_ababyatemydingo	AITA for asking a friend to leave at 2 am and causing a loud fight?	" I live across country and only get to visit home at christmas to see friends and family. This year my parents bought a beach house, so it was an excuse to fly back with my BF in summer. It's a struggle when visiting to balance family and friends, this means when friends come by we usually hang with my parents a bit too, who always provide food and drink.

I invite my friend A out to the house. She can be hard to get along with and has annoyed me in the past but we usually have fun.

She arrives hours late, so I have to have lunch with BF and his dad who drove up to see us. I ask her to join. We buy her lunch and drinks since she had to uber out. She starts getting a little too tipsy at lunch which makes me a worried.

Afterwards, me and her sit on the beach and catch up. It starts to rain and we head back. At the house is my dad, sister, sisters friend, and BF. I propose we all play ""WDYM"" and things get bad.

A is now drunk, my parents have open bar policy, but it is early and she is displaying antisocial behavior. Being dismissive, rolling her eyes, getting annoyed when I don't choose her cards, clearly she doesn't want to play. A takes me outside and starts complaining loudly (people can hear) that she doesn't see me often so its weird to have to hang out with my dad and she thinks my sister hates her. I try to be understanding but I'm uncomfortable. A pizza arrives and noone wants to finish the game. A starts complaining about this and about people eating pizza. I ask A what would make her happy and she wants to go to a bar. I really don't want to but A's behavior is bizarre so we leave.

At the bar she is happy till BF said she has to drink water before he buys her a drink. She gets angry and wants him to leave. I ask her what is wrong and she says BF called her out for rude behavior earlier. I try to give her some advice on why maybe this is why she has trouble with friendships. The rest of the night is us trying to calm her down while she sobs about her life. She starts saying we are attacking her and cant understand because our lives are perfect. I've had enough. I say we are going home to sleep and will drive her back in AM.

Back at the house (2 am) she keeps loudly crying about her life and asking for more booze. We try to quiet her and calm her (everyone upstairs is asleep) but she worsens.

I tell her it's time to leave. She snaps, starts insulting us. I can't keep cool and call her a psycho and this behavior is why her life is a mess. She says horrible things to us, trying to sabotage our relationship. Tells BF I'm a gold digger and then calls me a ""brainwashed slave"" Regretfully I start yelling back horrible things and crying too. We wake everyone up. It takes over an hour for us get her out, I say to never contact me again.

"okay so a bit of backstory, i’m 15, in year 10 and have a serious problem with saying no. my friend (A) really liked one of my other friends (B) and asked her out. now A got rejected, B said that she just didn’t feel that way about her and then realised that she actually did (!!). so they ended up getting together and about six hours later i get a call from an unknown number.

so it’s basically A talking about how she wasn’t comfortable in being in a relationship and she thinks everything’s going too fast and how she really isn’t over he ex. and then for some stupid fucking reason i agreed to dumb B for her! yay! 

so i’m panicking about this all morning and i get into school today and in science (P2) A comes up to me with another one of my mates and i tell her that i can’t do it, i value both A and B as friends and can’t do this to B. it’s cruel. so then my other friend says she’ll do it for her. 

then at break we’re all sat down and A writes a note and gives it to my friend. and she deadass stands up and puts it on B’s table? no real explanation, no actual closure, it’s not even delivered by A. 

and understandably B is upset, and i think that if i wouldn’t have chickened out i could’ve told her to confront A, and it wouldn’t be too bad for her if she spoke to her in person. and i feel so guilty because like? idk? so yeah i really need to know if i’m the asshole here and if i can do anything to help fix this situation? should i have told B or should i have just left it????

c5u86l	2019-06-26 19:13:06	ScreamingCadaver	WIBTA if I asked my neighbor to stop mowing my yard?	"This one has a bit of backstory so I apologize for the length.  I live in the midwest United States, where most people are overly polite and damn near everybody is passive aggressive.   This last winter we got a LOT of snow.  I don't have a snowblower and my neighbor was kind enough to snowblow our sidewalk (just the city sidewalk part in front of the house, not the sidewalk on our actual property) for us on multiple occassions.  Nothing was ever discussed, he just did it a few times and we appreciated it.  Once, when the snow was too wet and heavy for a blower I went and shoveled his front walk, and then this spring I got him a case of beer as a thank you for helping us out.   So far so good, good neighbors etc.

&#x200B;

This summer he has started mowing the grass on the side of my house that faces his property.   Again, nothing was discussed, he's just started doing it.  Now, my wife and I are neuro-divergent and raising a young son so some days I'm just not capable of getting out to mow (not an excuse, I just mention it by way of explanation; I'm not lazy, I just have mental problems).  So admittedly our yard is sometimes a bit scraggly (though I am sure to mow the front yard every week so at least the neighborhood doesn't look awful).  But I always catch up on the back and side yards within a week or so.   

&#x200B;

I'm wondering whether he's being passive aggressive and instead of just telling me that it bothers him that I don't mow as often as I should he's just doing it himself as a way to throw up a middle finger.  But in light of us helping each other out with snow removal I'm not sure if maybe he's just being nice.  In my state, helping folks out during the winter is a fairly common thing because we have some seriously savage winters.  But mowing somebody else's yard is almost unheard of.   Maybe this is just a midwestern war-of-neighborly-assistance (which, believe me, is an actual Thing), or maybe he's being a jerk.  If he's being nice I don't want to offend him.  But at the same time, I feel like I would just continue to owe him favors and whatnot if he continues doing this.  We're pretty quiet and not super social with the neighbors, we typicalyl prefer to keep to ourselves.  Would I be an asshole if I let him know that I will take care of my own lawn and politely asked him to please stop, or should I just let it go and move on with my life?  

&#x200B;

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this.  Thanks in advance, even if you end up ruling me the asshole. :)

EDIT: Thanks for the responses.  I'm sure you can tell I'm pretty neurotic and these answers have helped keep me grounded with this.  I'll just keep on as I have been and periodically chuck him a case of beer as thanks."	No A-holes here	0	0

So, I've had a crush on this girl at my college for 3 years. We had the same circle of friends and always had the same classes together. She didn't know that I have feelings for her until last year, the second year that I liked her. This year however, we kinda grew close and talked more and more until the end of the school year where she admitted by letter that she also had feelings for me. This was actually the highlight of my whole year and I was really happy. So we started talking every day until recently, we stopped taliking for 2 weeks. Just out of nowhere. All my friends keep saying I'm an idiot but my defense is she was replying ""coldly"" to my messages and inboxing them even though I see that she's very active on the group chats that we are in together. What happened was, one day she just left me on seen and then I just didn't try to start a conversation anymore. My friends then kept saying how stupid I was because she's finally given me a chance after 3 years. But I'm still not sure I'm solely to blame because couldn't she have started a conversation herself. I mean I was the one who sent the last message. I apologized this morning after 15 days and said I wa sorry.

c5u3zi	2019-06-26 19:05:27	rosemaryrants	AITA if I don’t feel comfortable spending my hard-earned money on junk food for my siblings?	"So, hello. I’m a university student, i have an art account and through it, I occasionally get commissions. I earned some cash through it, and recently sold an artwork for a really good price. 
So far, I haven’t spent it except for a few skincare products, I use it when I want to order food or go out etc. The usual stuff. 

I plan on ordering some good art supplies, and I don’t want to put that burden on my mom. I would rather spend the money I earned. 

I might get a MacBook. Idk. I haven’t even decided yet, I don’t rush into things and I’m definitely a cautious spender. I just know that I want to spend it on something I really want, which will be long-term too.  

Before I even started occasionally-earning, My siblings often used to tease me about my large appetite, and even though I’m slim and I love my body, I started feeling the need to control myself. I would often say no, when they wanted to order junk food. They would then tease me about being “weird with my money”. Etc etc. 

Now that I do have money, it feels even worse. I still order food but only if I crave it. I often pay for my sisters, who are never as insulting as my brothers. I also recently chipped in a good amount of cash for my sister’s phone. 

As of right now, I said no to junk food because I don’t feel well. My brother asked me to pay for him as well, and I said okay. Only then, I realised that I owed some money to my sister because she paid for me when I had misplaced my wallet. So I told him that I’ll be returning her money, and that I can’t pay for him right now. He immediately retorted to insulting me. I asked him if he has ANY cash, and he said no. I told him that I’ll pay for him. And he rudely refused me, and I felt hurt. I’m only 20, he’s 17. He often wins money through some gaming tournaments but I never expected him to feed me.. lol."

c5u3dd	2019-06-26 19:04:16		AITA for refusing to pick up my bedroom at my parents house? (I’m 23)	I moved out of my parent’s home and into my own apartment when I was 20. I’m now 23. In January my neighbor misfired his gun through my bedroom wall. No one was hurt, but I had to move out. I decided to move back to my parent’s home and they were happy to have me. Only my mom and dad and I live in the house. I then decided to stay with them until Oct. or Nov. of 2019 as I am saving up for law school. I pay them $500 a month for rent (I have a full-time job as a paralegal), clean up after myself, help them with things they need, run errands, and try to generally be pleasant to live with. I’m grateful that my childhood bedroom is available and that they allow me to live with them. I have always been a messy person (while having ADD is not an excuse, it is a factor I am managing the best I can) but I always try to keep my messiness contained to spaces that only affect me, such as my bedroom or my car. As a college roommate for example, I went to great lengths to be neat (though sometimes I failed) because I knew it would be rude to my roommate to be overly messy. Now, my bedroom at my parents' house is messy (I’d like to point out that its messy, not dirty. There’s no moldy food, its mainly laundry on the floor and an overcrowded vanity with makeup and hair products), but I make sure I keep common areas clean. Once a month or so I will do a deep clean, but it always becomes messy again. The problem: my father insists almost daily that I clean my bedroom up and keep it clean. The room is on the 2nd floor with a door and he has no reason to pass by or go in my room. I told him that it's my room right now and I don’t see a reason why it needs to be pin-straight neat if no one never sees it but me. He says he owns my room and I live in his house, so I must do as he says. He and my mom say that they are allowing me to live there, meaning my rent payment is just something extra to them and it does not have any “rights” attached to it. My argument is that if I pay $500 a month, I’m renting the room, meaning it’s mine and I can do with it as I please as long as it doesn’t effect anyone else and isn’t crazy or unreasonable. When I lived in an apartment, the leasing company had a right to tell me not to have a loud barking dog, unsanitary conditions, or to flood the bathroom. It didn’t have the right to tell me to keep it neat. My mom says I’m being an immature brat. I can most definitely clean up my room, but I don’t want to send the message to my father that he has the authority to tell me what to do, I feel I’m too old for that and I deserve to be respected as an equal adult, not a teenager. I’m completely open to opinions because I genuinely can’t tell who is in the wrong here. It very well could be me, but my instinct is saying its him. Am I a jerk? Please be honest. Thanks.		1	0

My best friend at the time had moved 6 hours away to college. She was visiting for some holiday and was planning on driving back down to school for a week, and then back up for another holiday. We thought this was a good chance for us to spend some time together, and since she was already going to be driving back to where I live, I might as well tag a long. 

We never discussed anything about the drive and I figured that because she was already planning on the trips either way, there wouldn't be any issues. When we left her house I saw her father give her money as we were about to pull out of the driveway. I had assumed it was gas money, but honestly I don't remember if I heard him say that's what the money was for. If it matters, he's the kind of dad who gives his daughter money for random stuff all the time, so I didn't see this as unusual. 

A couple hours into the drive, she pulls into a gas station and tells me to pay for the gas while she runs in to grab a snack. Needless to say, I was shocked. I had no clue she wanted me to pay for any gas. It would be different if we were on a road trip that we would not have gone on otherwise, but she was already going to drive back to school whether or not I was going with her. I paid for the gas but felt kind of slighted that she sprung a $60 expense on me without discussing it and basically just running away. Not to mention that we both knew she had a 20 hour a week job, while I had a 4 hour a week job. 

An hour later into the drive and she pulls over again and tells me to drive the rest of the way. Again, I'm just thinking ""what the fuck."" I had never driven her car before and I had never driven more than an hour at a time. Only had my license for a year, too. Again, I complied but at this point I was pissed. 

She pulled the same shit on the drive back and I still complied because I was a pushover back then. Would I have been the asshole if I refused or fought against it?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I mainly do this for the fiber, but they pay for themselves just about. I only breed one litter a year. I brush them frequently, they have outside runs, and they are pampered  bunny's. I love them, and think of the as pets most of the time, but at the end of the day, they are livestock. Now, storytime. 

Yesterday I went to feed my buns, and one of my juvenile babies was extremely lethargic and floppy.  He was covered  in diarrhea and wouldn't move. I cleaned  him up and got him warming. I decided  not to take him to the vet for these reasons: 

It was very unlikely he would make it, 

The vet was an hour away,

The stress of taking rabbits to the vet can often kill them

It would  be at least 400 dollars in vet fees if not more.

He died about an hour later.

I posted about him in one of my rabbit  group, asking  for advice for things I could  do at home to help him. I got dozens of responses calling me names and abusive, and evil.

Someone  called me a homophobic anti vaxxer, someone else called me an evil bitch, and a ton of people called me an asshole. 

A lot of my friends are calling me an asshole. I thought  a made the right choice,  but now I'm feeling like maybe I didn't make the right  choice.  Was I the asshole for not taking him to the vet?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

We were sending funny pictures/videos back and forth, messing around, not a big deal at all. Just her and I joking around as usual. My boyfriend was in the room so he was in the background of some pictures and videos. 

Later on in our conversation, she saw my boyfriend without his shirt on the in the background and responds and says “you got some moobs boy” this obviously kind of set my boyfriend off and he went on a roasting tangent basically. He told my friend in a video “you’re pretty fat yourself” 
Immediately following, she gets mad and comes at ME sideways saying things along the lines of “oh he should know better, why does he talk to women this way, you probably told him to call me fat, why would you still send that video to me” I was so mind blown because she had been going off on my boyfriend saying how he wasn’t even that skinny (he’s lost over 100 lbs doing the keto diet) and how he had big man boobs, etc, 

To this day, she doesn’t talk to me because her boyfriend said “I think you should remove her because she can’t control her boyfriend” so...am I the asshole?? Or in the wrong in any way?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5trc7	2019-06-26 18:41:58		WIBTA for leaving without telling my friends goodbye?	"Backstory: I lived in Alabama for 6 years before moving back to texas last year. Since these years were middle school and some high school, the people i met were my best friends. I was in a few friend groups, but there was one main group of friends that hung out often. I moved to Texas around a year ago and it was rough. Rough for me for moving to a new school hundred of miles away from my friends and rough for them for losing a close friend. We still kept in touch while i was in texas but not often. some friends messaged me more than others which was fine. i didn’t think that they hated me because they didn’t message me often, were just kids in the middle of a high school year and people are busy, i get it. 
To now: I came back to alabama to visit for most of the summer because i missed it. I got back and everyone surprised me at the house i was staying at. we hung out that day and the day after catching up. It felt like i had never left. 
    I had planned to stay for about a month just to hang out and mainly because i had no friends in texas yet. A few days go by and only one friend still wants to hang out. I didn’t think twice about it because we had a blast. But after about a week there, some will make plans with me, then never show up or completely ignore me when i text them. Again i wasn’t too hurt because i understood they had lives before i came back.
   At one point, i sat at the house for a week and a half without anyone even texting me. I invited everyone to church that sunday afternoon just so i could see them again.( 10 people in all ) nobody showed up. the excuses were “not today” or no text back at all. It was rough. i went home after church and almost cried. I hadn’t made any new friends and they had seemed to already forget about me.
   (This all adds up to the end i promise)
    About 4 days later, i was actually invited to go fishing down at the lake with them. I went down and after fishing we went back to one of their houses so they could paint summer boxes. It was around 9 when XXX said he wanted to go home but didn’t have a ride. So someone offered him a ride home, but then 4 other people joined them in a 45 minute trip to take on person home. They left me and 2 others at the house by ourselves. It wasn’t until 2 hours later that we began to get a little irritated. They took most of the group and ended up getting food, stopping by another persons house and just driving around. All without saying anything to anyone. So before they got back, i just left and went “home”. only one person from the groups of 5 bothered to ask where i went.
   I don’t mean to sound like they MUST hang out with me, but even if i still live there. you don’t ditch 3 of your “friends” for 2 hours without saying anything. I fly back out to texas on monday and don’t plan on even texting them before I leave.
TLDR: I plan on flying back home without telling my friends from another state after they ditched me."	Asshole	1	0

&#x200B;

So everyone, I've (20M) reached quite the predicament. Back in Mid March my Best-Friend (John) and his girlfriend (Jane) broke up right after returning from a week-long vacation to another state. It all seemed really suspicious, but Jane broke up with John and John was heartbroken. Went through some stuff, talked to a couple of his really close friends including myself and another guy(Paul). Well, later I find out from Jane's closest friend(Savannah) that Jane had started sleeping with Paul THE SAME NIGHT that John and Jane broke up.  I confronted Jane about this, and she confirmed it but promised she would tell John about this herself. I  gave it a few weeks and when John was talking about getting back together with Jane I went back to Jane and demanded she tell John the truth, at which point she went off on me telling me it was none of my business and to keep their names (Jane and Paul) out of my mouth. I decided to advise John to just move on from Jane, that he deserved better, etc. Well, I found out today from Savannah (Whom I am still friends with at this point) that Jane and Paul had officially gotten together and they were planning on telling John as summer ends. I know that they won't tell the full situation, So I planned on informing John of the full truth ASAP. However, I know this information will hurt him more, and he may end up feeling betrayed because I didn't tell him sooner.

c5tk2t	2019-06-26 18:28:38		AITA?	"So, I'm a teenager. A year ago, I spent $20 (a lot for a teenager) to spend on a rubber chicken that squeaked. I named him Samuel, and he means a lot to me being one of my first actual purchases off of money I made myself (as in, not allowance. I'm a freelance artist, and I got a few commissions and thought I should buy this chicken.) I chose him in a Spencer's, contrary to literally anything else. I love him very very much, I bring him anywhere I could, until we moved lately. Since I lived at my old house, my brother hated it whenever I squeaked him. He hated him so much I couldn't squeak him any more even if it were an accident before he got mad at me, so I just stopped using him. But back to present times, a few days ago my brother asked me if he could borrow him so I took out lovely Samuel under the impression I was being a good older sibling and letting him share. Now, he calls him Jamal and HIS Jamal. Wtf? This morning, we had just had a slight quarrel as I told him to give back Samuel, and he defensively replied ""his NAME is JAMAL and he is MINE!!!"" and confused, I asked ""what do you mean? His name is Samuel. I bought him."" ""But you never took care of him! HE LIKES TO SLEEP WITH ME!"" I. Was. Shocked.
I just offered to buy him one, and he had the guts to tell ME to buy my OWN 'JAMAL' because the one he has is 'SPECIAL'

I'm losing it. He's always been spoiled, him being the youngest. I don't know, I am just paranoid that I am the asshole here for wanting to take back something I bought and still cherish. It's the one thing that I have that is actually mine, that I bought and wasn't given to me. Samuel was there with me for everything, including my first heart-wrenching breakup. Maybe I'm overselling it, but I don't think I'm the asshole for wanting something back that a spoiled kid mistakenly thinks is his 🤷‍♂️"		1	0

I said no to this, since I lack the inspiration and motivation to do this, making me hate the art i do; and now, they're calling me the bad guy for not accepting their advice, getting mad because 'I won't make it big' because of this and 'I shouldn't be ignoring their advice'.

No problem, I reply, here's my real email, please email me, and I'll reply to that. The buyer refused. I said, I'm sorry, I want a real form of communication before I send out my house address. The reason I do this, is that we live in the country in a house, and I don't want anonymous people knowing the exactly  where I live. The appliances are too big to bring to a public location.

c5tc1w	2019-06-26 18:13:44	SnkrVader	AITA for not letting my brother-in-law stay/live in our house	"Me(25m) and my wife(23) has just recently kicked out my brother-in-law(16) and he has returned to my mother-in-law's house.

TLDR: I kicked out my brother-in-law for being a slacker and having the inability to own up his mistakes

background: I am the one paying for my brother-in-law's schooling and schooling expenses, me and my wife contemplated on letting him stay/live in our house for the next few years for two major reasons:

•My mother-in-law is verbally abusive, my wife got off easy since she was raised by her grandparents
•Our house is much nearer to the school (30 mins vs. 1hr 45 mins)

During the current summer vacation we have taken him under our wing, but during his stay he has refused to be a significant help in the house (e.g. helping us clean up after a meal would be a great help), playing the PS4 when he is awake, staying in his room locked up while the AC is on, and even not doing his assigned chores (trash duty, since me and my wife leave before the trash pick up comes).

So he crossed the line when during his enrollment he did not follow simple instruction which has costed us 100 USD(equivalent, his tuition fee is around 300 USD for the school year) mind you, we are pretty well off, my only gripe is his inability to follow my very simple instruction, and then when I scolded him, he told my siblings and cousins (through their chat group, we are a super close to my side of the family) that we are always on his ass, that we are always giving him chores, and that we don't give him a break (thanks to my little sis for asking us about the truth of the matter, because of her we found our about the chat group)

When we sent him back to my mother-in-law's house (mutual decision between me and my wife) she has sent us messages regarding money problems and how she can't raise my brother-in-law by herself, and how my wife is a useless daughter who is uncaring for her own brother and mother.

Mind you, we're still on the fence on taking him back on the merit that he will change.

If there are more questions, will be willing to give more details.

Sometimes she’ll force me to try something I hate/ she likes, sometimes she’ll eat something that tastes like ass and it’s so gross to her she’ll force me to try it too and vice versa. 

We have a very jokey and loving relationship so neither of us particularly mind this and we both love food so it’s really just who we are. 

We were out with family + friends for my MILS 60th birthday and there were ceviche tacos served which I’ve never had before and thought they tasted exquisite. My wife was next t me and I told her to try some. She said eww, no it’s fish, but I scooped up some and the assorted garnishes and told her to open up. She started laughing and said ‘seriously, no I don’t want it!’ But I held it there and she rolled her eyes but smiled and ate it. 

Just to add context, I would NEVER ever press it if I knew from her body language she was on a solid no about something but we do this to each other all the time and I know she eats fish so it’s not like I was making her eat an ingredient she hates. 

She visibly liked it and said oh, give me some more. I made her up a little taco and placed it on her plate, by which point her best friend from childhood (don’t really know her prior to this) who was sat opposite said ‘I can’t believe you let him force you into that, it’s disgusting’.

For background info, I live down on the southern side of Texas and if you live down here you know a good chunk of out demographic is Latino. I work in a fast food chain and majority of our customer base (at least as I’ve noticed) seems to be of Latino descent. Most speak are bilingual in English and Spanish which makes communication an absolute breeze. However we have a couple of families who come in who only speak Spanish which results in a lot of pointing at certain sections of the menu and I have to guess what their asking for. It made getting their order right a bit difficult, but didn’t outright infuriate me. That all changed this morning though.

I was dealing with our traditional lunch rush when we had a Latino family of 12 roll in. They walked up to the counter and just started speaking Spanish immediately to me. Now I might want to add the only sentence I know in Spanish is “I don’t speak Spanish”.  Trust me if you work in Customer Service knowing to say this is invaluable, but moving on. The Father gets infuriated and starts shouting at me in Spanish, again I don’t the exact words. My manager who speaks a bit more Spanish than I picked up some of their words and pulled me to the back. She asked what happened then I explained the whole situation to her which caused her to get mad at me. She walked up front to handle the family and they decided to eventually walk out. She called me into the back office and said she had to send me home for the day given how the customers decided to file a complaint on me. The complaint was about me supposedly being unprofessional and rude to the customer.

c5t82u	2019-06-26 18:06:23	footlongspider	WIBTA if I did not invite my sister to my wedding?	"Some background for this: I'm the daughter of a failed marriage that my mother likes to pretend it never happened, at the same time she would use me to get stuff out of my dad even though she got married a few months later.. My sister is the daughter of that second marriage and we were raised together up until I was 14 and ran away to live with my dad. Unlike my relationship with my mother that was pretty bad, my relationship with my sister has always been good.

&#x200B;

Now to the story: My fiancé and I have been engaged for 2 months, I knew I couldn't stop the news from reaching my mother but I was ready to deal with her when the time eventually came. This weekend I got a text for her congratulating me and saying that she was sorry that she didn't reach out earlier. She also said that she was upset that I didn't speak to her personally about it but it was okay because my sister had done it. Then, she proceeded to tell me how she was moving to another place soon but I didn't have to worry about it when sending out the invites because my sister had assured her she would deliver it. 

&#x200B;

Now, I gave the benefit of the doubt because I know how our mother can be sometimes and decided to speak with my sister. My sister didn't deny it but to my surprise she was a 100% on board with our mother coming to my wedding. I told her that it was obviously not happening but she told me to take some time and reflect because it would be a great time to reconnect and have her around. I told her once again that no, she would not be invited and that I had no interest in reconnecting. 

&#x200B;

This weekend, my sister sent me a message saying that we were all adults now and that we had better ways to deal with our problems and asked me once again to think about it. I told her flat out that since she could invite our mother to her wedding when that time came but I was not doing it and I wouldn't be inviting her either. She got pretty pissed with me because she was only trying to help and that I shouldn't be shooting the messenger.  Things are pretty tense right now and I'm trying to get some perspective because I don't feel comfortable sharing these types of issues and having my name attached to it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I do marketing, social media, that kind of stuff so most of the day I'm in my own little world. Sometimes my bosses need to talk to me face to face to sort out finer points of certain projects but for the most part I'm on my own. I have a single other coworker who does office administration stuff; our work isn't related.

Our bosses are most often not in the office. Not because they're slacking, they're just busy at meetings and visiting our various locations for what have you. But it does get frustrating to have to drive almost 30 miles every day to do a job I know could be done from my living room 99% of the time. I won't fight that point; I know what job I signed up for, so I'll come in to work.

But my bosses are leaving Tuesday July 2nd to go on vacation out of the country. They've informed us they'll be 100% unavailable until Monday July 8th, when they return.

My coworker and I have off Thursday July 4th. I really see no reason to come in on Friday July 5th when not a single member of the family will be around or even available. I'd like to ask for the day off for the two of us but the fact that it hasn't been suggested makes me feel like I WBTA. Just because they're on vacation doesn't mean I should be, I guess.

My dad and I maintain these houses when something needs work (water heater elements, basic plumbing, siding, etc). My dad has an eye disease called Retinitis Pigmentosa which is basically tunnel vision that gets worse with time. He's got about 10-15% vision left. His condition must weigh on his mental health because all he does is eat and bitch at my mom. He used to be a whole lot better to be around.

The past few weeks I've been stuck at home dealing with Ulcerative Colitis and because of that we haven't been able to get much done. I'm not in a great place mentally either if we're being honest.

I can't take watching my dad's condition slowly get worse and worse. Every time I've mentioned not working with him to my mom, all she says is basically ""Suck it up, I deal with it too"". My grandma doesn't really understand that my dad isn't capable of doing the things he used to so all that gets left for me to figure out. When I do feel good enough to get something done, I end up doing most of the work while dad micromanages everything. Plus I get no say in the jobs we do ourselves or source out.

&#x200B;

I've been working on these rental homes since I was 6 (19 now) and I'm pretty much trapped here. If I'm not around, nothing gets done and my grandma doesn't like hiring people to do work because she's got my dad and I to do it for less. Any time I've talked about doing something else, it's met with ""well who's going to take care of the rentals"". I had to turn down working at a local body shop (my future career and what I'll be going to school for) because of these fucking houses.

Later on that day, they send me a text saying they want a refund as it sways when used to film events and their boss is really mad at them for buying it. I declined.

My initial reason being that they tested the monopod out themselves before paying and saw the slight swaying and still opted to take it.

I work at a major hardware/home improvement store. It is strictly gainful employment, as I am taking a welding class this summer.

I only recently got it figured out and got into a class that I could sign up for. However, my schedule is made 3 weeks out, and my class is going to interfere with 3 of my scheduled shifts (all on Thursdays), including one of them tomorrow. I am more invested in the class than the job, but I love my job as well. The management at the store knows that I am in school, although I have not told them about this class.

I am currently at work on my break. WIBTA for talking to my manager or HR later? What is the best way to go about this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5t3gv	2019-06-26 17:57:59	AConflictedMind	AITA for demanding that my girlfriend share details of a discussion relating to a project we are both working on?	"Okay, so I want to preface this by saying that a solid 8/10 times when we argue it actually is my fault and that I in no way want this to turn into a relationship-ender or anything like that. But she's really angry at me for this particular situation and I am struggling to see how I am in the wrong.

&#x200B;

Now, this issue technically starts a long way back before this incident happened. I installed TeamViewer on my computer so she could help me with some technical stuff I'm not very good at. She did help me as promised, but also used that opportunity to spam post in a bunch of group Discord servers under my name. She didn't go through any of my private discussions and ultimately it was mostly harmless, but I feel like my trust has been violated and since then I haven't given her access to my computer because I don't want her to do it again. This is something of an ongoing sore spot whenever it comes up.

&#x200B;

I'm telling you that bit of backstory because it comes into play again here. We're just chilling together, doing our own thing, when she off-offhandedly mentions that there's going to be changes in a game development project we both work on with a group of other people and that she's been discussing those changes with the person who is basically our ""acting team lead"" for want of a better term.

&#x200B;

When I asked her what those changes were, she refused to tell me because it had been a private conversation between two people. Now, maybe I shouldn't have raised my hackles quite as fast as I did, but this really pissed me off. Firstly, because I'm the project's writer and I need to know if I have to alter the story to fit these changes, and secondly, because it is a group project that we're meant to all have input on, even if the discussion isn't in our area of expertise - that's been how we've operated since the beginning. I don't think it's fair for two people to be deciding on changes for themselves when this is a group project that we've previously all had the opportunity to weigh in on. She's certainly given input on how she thinks certain characters should be portrayed.

&#x200B;

Suffice to say, we got into an argument over the situation. She says that I don't have any faith in her abilities because I want to have the option to be involved in discussions relating to the project. She also says that this situation is me prying into conversations that have nothing to do with me and that I'm a hypocrite for poking my nose into it when I'm not prepared to give her access to my computer after the previously mentioned TeamViewer incident. 

&#x200B;

I know for a fact she's amazingly talented, I don't doubt her skill. I just don't think it's fair for her and the other person to go off and start deciding things by themselves when in the past we've all had the chance to be a part of things if we felt we had something to add.

&#x200B;

I don't know though. Am I blowing this out of proportion and invading her privacy by expecting to be privy to what was discussed?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c5szhb	2019-06-26 17:50:25	throwaway__1332	AITA for not helping my dad?	"This is a throwaway account.

So a little bit of background. I am 17 (male in case that matters) and live with my parents, and for as long as I can remember they have always been fighting.I have mostly gotten used to it and usually don't pay attention when that happens, but today they were really crossing the line so I started yelling at them and telling them that they are acting like little children who can't resolve a conflict without fighting, and that they should think about how their children feel (I have a brother who lives here too) when they have to hear them fighting and wake up to their yells.As usual, they didn't pay me much attention and continued fighting right after I went back to my room.

A few minutes later things have quieted down, and 30 minutes after their fight my dad comes to my room like nothing happened and asks for help with something on his phone. I deny his request and tell him that if he wants to speak to me, he should first learn how to speak with my mom like actual adults, and that I wasn't willing to talk to both of them until they act like adults.My dad didn't take that very well, and said something along the lines of ""From now on I am no longer your dad and don't think of me as one,  don't ever ask me for help or talk to me again"". He then called me an idiot and walked out of my room.

Before you pass your judgment, I do realize that my dad is the asshole in the way he reacted, although I don't know how much he actually meant the things he said, but what I'm asking here is not who's the asshole based on our interaction and reactions, but if I'm the asshole because I interfered with their fight that had nothing to do with me, and refused to help because of it, or if I'm in the right for trying to talk sense into them and refusing to help my dad for the way he's acting.

I would also like to add that my parents aren't and have never been abusive. There have only been 2 times in my life where my dad has called me an idiot or insulted me, this being one of them. They are usually very supportive.

TL;DR My parents were fighting, I tried to talk to them but they ignored me. Later after the fight my dad asked me for help with his phone but I ignored his request, and got insulted by him."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I understand that she just cares but she also knew that I would be the one taking care of this kid. I'm the only one in this house that is able to(do her laundry,take her to school etc) ++++She's tolerating the behavior of that kid's mom, you're supposed to be responsible and take care of your fucking kids.

c5sxlg	2019-06-26 17:47:17	on_nelly	AITA for selling my grandmother's ring?	"My grandmother gave me her old engagement ring. She has given one to every girl in the family, and this one was mine. She is a rather materialistic person who is super attached to ""things"", whereas I am kind of a minimalist who dislikes having too much stuff.

&#x200B;

When she gave it to me, she said, ""You must never pawn it."" And a second time, when it came up in conversation, ""You must not hock it."" This was super important to her, and the suggestion that I would inevitably be down on my luck was kind of insulting at the time. Even so, I promised I wouldn't.

More than 10 years have passed since she gave it to me. The truth is, I don't like the ring. I dislike rings in general, and have no fondness for this one. It sits in a safe, and when I pick it up, all I can remember are the many somewhat insulting things she has said to me over the years (another topic, maybe, for another day; let's just say she has been severely passive aggressive towards me, and maybe there is a passive aggressive aspect to me wanting to sell this damn ring, even when I said I wouldn't). One of the things that factors into this decision was a passive aggressive display where she gave off all her nice jewelry to her ""favorites"", whereas my mother--her daughter-in-law--who she has always been critical of, she gave a piece of jewelry from Walmart.

&#x200B;

So for these and other reasons, I'm thinking of selling the ring. Even so, I feel guilty about doing so. I feel like I'd be going back on the promise I made her. I could use the money (maybe a couple thousand dollars) but I'm not desperate. I was actually thinking of just putting it into a savings account for a rainy day. (I'm a freelancer with not much in savings, for what that's worth.)

AITA for selling this ring?

EDIT: I added 2 small pieces of info to add clarity.

INFO: My grandmother is not yet deceased. She is in a nursing home (yes, I visit her) and it is unlikely she would know if I were to sell it.  


FINAL EDIT: I accept everyone's judgment. I will not sell the ring; the key to this seems to be the fact that I am not on hard times and would be selling it to get rid of it.

c5sv0s	2019-06-26 17:42:35	Cluedude	WIBTA if ask a someone who is no longer a friend to pay back money he owes me when I originally said it was ok not to?	"Around easter I made a new friend, D. I'm a student in a student town and as such I liked to go out clubbing a lot, as did he - he was fun and we got along really well to begin with, and I enjoyed spending my time with him. However, D tends to be irresponsible and therefore ended up asking people to borrow money a lot, including me.

At the time I didn't mind lending him a fiver every now and again so that he could afford a bus into town so we could hang out - I wanted to spend my time with him so I didn't care! He swore that as soon as he got a job, he'd pay back everything he owed me. I said that it wasn't a rush and he could take his time, that our hanging out was the whole point, but D insisted that he would out of principle.

He got a new job two months ago. About a week after he started the job, I asked if he was indeed going to pay me back, he stated that he ""was broke"", but that he would once his first paycheque came in. I further reiterated that it was okay and that he should pay off more important things first, like his travel expenses. Since then, he has yet to pay back a single penny of the £45 total he owes me. He continues to go out clubbing every other night and buy fast food, and then, last weekend, he traveled a fair distance over to the next city to get a large, intricate tattoo on the back of his hand.

I don't want to seem like the friendship was transactional, but ever since I expressed my dislike for his girlfriend's character, D has refused to hang out with me again, and will end any conversation I start over text in a few minutes. I'm annoyed that he's clearly able to pay me back but won't (when he said he would), but I feel like the fact I told him he was off the hook whenever I gave him money will be thrown back in my face.

I started making plans to move out when I heard the news. I had wanted to leave before, but that was truly the driving force. My mom is in a terrible financial situation, yet she got pregnant very intentionally, believing that if she couldn't be home to take care of it, I would be. This was confirmed when I confronted her about it and she offered to pay me $800 a month to be her nanny if it made me feel better. Ever since I started my first job after a long debilitating illness, I have really began to notice how much she seems to take advantage of me and I'm sick of it. I have no guaranteed time for myself. It started with the car. 

Yes, it is her car, no I don't pay a dime for it, but there's a reason. In exchange for using her car, I had to run any errands that she wanted. I felt I got the short end of the stick because if I wanted to use the car for something I actually wanted to do, I could always be shut down and often was. Even if I didn't actually have the car with me,  (I sometimes took the the bus into town), I had to make sure there wasn't anything to be done when I wanted to be gone. If I did have the car, I was ""on call"" essentially. If I showed any attitude about doing something easy enough for her to do it herself, e.g. going to the gas station for chips, she would often become pissy with me for the rest of the day. I have offered more in rent, or a car payment, just to buy back a little freedom, but she ignores my requests so that we could have our ""exchange."" I now have a car lent to me by my dad who is being a lot more flexible about it and I do pay insurance for that one.

Now I'm in the final phase of moving out, and I've voiced my intention to bring my dog, Kylo, with me. Because she technically owns Ky, she won't let me take him, instead offering up her husband's untrained, obnoxious dog for me to take instead. I know it's a tactic to try to get me to stay, as I adore Ky, but the sheer manipulation of it has pushed me to move out earlier than I originally intended. 

I have tried to voice my side of things, but I'm always told I'm entitled or that I need a wake up call. I have always worried that it's true.

  I was at my Friend’s cottage. Friend brought their two dogs along last minute. These dogs are poorly trained; one in particular is extremely food driven and is known to jump on islands and eat dinner off the dining table. I have never been to the cottage and said to Friend before the trip that I’m going to bring some exciting marijuana edibles (bad idea in hind-sight, although it’s legal in this country and we are over the age). A few days into the trip Friend finds that their dog got into my hidden bag containing the edibles after chewing though the defences. I hid them under piles of clothing and in a bag, in another plastic bag. I have never had a pet before, and don’t know the precautions regarding food. Friend is furious, frantic over their dog, saying that their dog could’ve died. I do everything I can to help and apologize. 

  Later, the dog survives and has zero health concerns; It was just a little groggy for a few hours. 

  Days pass, Friend is furious with me. Stern that this situation is all my fault, and insists that I pay the entire vet bill of $450.

c5ssjy	2019-06-26 17:37:27	pettired	WIBTA if I made my husband give away his pet?	"
So my partner and I have a pig as a pet. A potbelly pig. We’ve had her for about a year and a half.

We’ve also recently become new parents.

My partner loves this animal but honestly she just stresses me out and causes anxiety for me.

Even the night we picked her up I regretted it and said we need to turn around and give her back.

We had always talked about getting a potbelly and I thought we did some pretty thorough research for years. Just to clarify this wasn’t a random spur of the moment decision.

He convinced me to give it a few weeks to see how it went.

She was ok at first. Adorable of course, what baby animal isn’t?? I’d snuggle with her.

But the noises. Her grunts and squeals are exhausting! And I know she can’t help that, she’s a pig.

I’d walk past her as I cleaned the house and she’ll squeal. She hated anyone being behind her and started to growl and snap at them.

Then I got pregnant last year and my anxiety ramped up

She’s so messy! And it didn’t bother my partner so he wouldn’t clean as constantly as I did and she was one of the main sources of mess. (He does help with chores.)

She also got so big and is so stubborn I cant control her anymore.

She ate through our pantry door one day trying to get to her food and my partner blamed me when I complained about it. Said I spilled the food on the floor and what did I expect a pig to do?

She’s torn up the floor when we moved the food into the garage. She’s torn up the side of house when she wants in but we don’t move fast enough.

I’m worried about when my child starts crawling that she will snap at her. She’s snapped at both me and my partner though they’ll deny it happened to them.

I’ve offered compromises. Said we could foster her until we can afford a house where she can be outside. Honestly we shouldn’t even have her as we are in city limits.

But he doesn’t want to get rid of her. And he is getting so depressed because of this issue. He started crying when I sent him a link about rehoming her. He’s pretty constantly sad thinking about giving her up and I don’t want that at all. I want him to be happy.


He finally said fine we can get rid of her but only if you get rid of our cat that I’ve had for 12 years. I was so desperate I said yes. Luckily a sibling of mine said they’d take her.

I don’t think he was expecting me to say yes and basically caved and said he was bluffing.

I basically broke down last night sobbing because every time I get near her she grunts or squeals. I woke up at 430 am that morning to take care of baby and as soon as I got into the living room she started up again.

It’s driving me crazy!

I pleaded with him that I’ll get rid of my cats, I’ll get him a different less noisy animal, anything!

But he says he doesn’t know why it bothers me so much because it doesn’t bother him. He said if I just pet her more she wouldn’t make noises.

AITA for basically forcing him to get rid of his beloved pet?

(Edit) Just to clarify a few things.  
1. I still have my cats, ultimately I wasn’t going to give them up as a result of this. I was just desperate and said what I thought he wanted to hear.
2. The pig isn’t kept inside all day long and has adequate access to the outside although I do believe she’d be better off at a nice farm.

(Final Edit)

Okay so it seems I’m not a complete asshole in that I’m concerned for my child’s safety. But I do definitely see where I’m the asshole in other ways!

Also I just wanted to say that my husband is a wonderful father and great husband!! This post is the one area basically where we disagree and we have a completely wonderful marriage besides this one issue. I didn’t want y’all to think he was terrible or anything.

Also also a pet is completely different from your child! What the heck y’all? I’m not gonna get rid of my kid ever...."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I'm a U.S. expat living in a European country, married to a man from here. We have children who are vaccinated according to our country's version of the CDC. We are coming for a  6-week visit to the U.S. in July which includes a family reunion, an extended family beach trip, and a lot of hanging out in my old hometown.

My brother married a darling woman who is a bit high maintenance and high strung. She's always had a lot of quirks and rules  and these have only become more numerous after they had children. She really likes to control situations and have all things go a certain way (her wedding day, her pregnancy, her birth, how her children are raised, etc.) Some of her rules are understandable, like everyone had to get a pertussis booster and a flu shot (if it was flu season) before visiting her newborn; she was very specific about when, who, what, and where the kids were offered their first foods. There's a long list but she is a kind and caring person and makes my brother happy so the family just tries to appease her. This is the first time we are visiting since they had children (ages 6 mos and 3 years) and a few months ago she called and said she was doing some research and saw our vaccine schedule differed from the U.S. and she wanted to make sure that our kids had all the ""American vaccines"" too. She sent a list of what my children should get before our trip. We politely declined. After that every call, text, and email is trying to convince us to get our kids vaccinated per American guidelines. We talked to our GP who, after making sure her children weren't immunocompromised, assured us our children were no risk to her children and advised against us getting the other vaccines. We thought having a medical opinion would end it, but it didn't and instead she emailed us that she found a doctor that would vaccinate them when we got in town. We again told her that we would not be doing that.

Now she is saying that she doesn't think she can let her family around our children. She is refusing to go to the reunion or the beach house and is planning on not coming to visit while we are at my parents. She has also said she doesn't want my brother to come without her on the off chance he picks something up from us. My dad is supportive of our decision but my mom really wants the whole family together and thinks I should just get them done so we don't have to deal with the drama. My husband and I say ""F- that"" and don't want to give in to her. This will create some turmoil as if they don't come reservations will need to be changed and my mom won't get that picture of ""everyone together"" she so desperately wants since we all started having babies. After getting off the phone with her crying this morning I kinda feel like an asshole but also feel like my SIL is the real asshole.

To be clear- the vaccines in question are varicella, a different meningitis vaccine, and less doses of a couple others.

&#x200B;

ETA: the differences are our country doesn't give the varicella vaccine (instead they give the shingles vaccine to adults), We give a different meningitis vaccine (the one America gives is the one that is given to children here at a much older age and our GP said my kids were too young for it); we also give 3 doses of the pneumoccocal vaccine instead of 4 and we give the fourth Dtap/polio between 3-4 when they are headed to preschool instead of at 12-15 months like the U.S. does. Our schedules are really, really similar and you really have to study them to find the differences."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5sp70	2019-06-26 17:30:05		AITA for not calling my friend after she left mid-camping trip?	"I'll try to keep this short. This last weekend I went camping with 2 other couples to celebrate a long time best friend's birthday. The plan was to eat breakfast together, then for the group to split up and do whatever tourist activities we wanted, and meet back up for dinner. We all woke up super early because the birds were up, and 4 of us expected breakfast right then because we were up, but the birthday girl and her bf decided they wanted to nap a couple hours before breakfast. The rest of us were yelled at to be quiet, so we were just sitting there bored and eager to get going for our activities that day. We decided that breakfast wasn't that important, and that we would hit the road while sending bday girl a text updating her on our plan. We did not wake them since they had yelled at us to let them sleep, and we did not wait for them to wake up because they let us know what time they set an alarm for and it was 2 hours away. 

After we arrived at our tourist location, we got an angry text from her, threatening to leave. Apparently she was so angry that we left before breakfast, and angry that we walked faster than her the night before (she is obese, takes her longer to get around, and we were at an outdoor mall. We walked at our own pace thinking it was ok as long as we all met up when we were done). We talked on the phone, they thought we were inconsiderate for leaving before breakfast, we thought they were inconsiderate for napping before breakfast and expecting us to wait for them. We agreed to talk about it that evening when we all returned and solve the issue. After all, we had been friends for 10 years and fought before, no big deal.
 
When we got back, they had packed up and left. We were shocked, because the reasons they were upset seemed a little insignificant to amount to leaving. It was clear to us that there was more she was upset about but wasn't telling us. Naturally I was upset, and decided not to call or text until I could cool off. Because I had collected everyone's share of the camp fee, I electronically refunded her cost for camping that evening, and asked if she accidentally took my earbuds I had lent her. She blew up, saying that she can't believe that's all I had to say to her, and ranting how I was accusing her of theft.

Later she unfriended me on Facebook. Is it just me, or is that an extreme overreaction to the situation? As I said before, I'm sure there was more to the issue that she was upset over, but she left and blocked us and denied us the opportunity to even hear her side of the story. It's easy for me to let people go, even a 10 year friendship, so am I the bad guy if I don't fight for this friendship? Her tantrum was so immature, seemed to be for petty reasons, and has shown me that she can be toxic.

c5sp3j	2019-06-26 17:29:51	_AceySpacey_	AITA for feeling envious?	"I have this friend, I've known them for about two years now, and we go to school together. We are very close and at one point in a relationship before we thought it would be better to go without the label of dating. 

I have been debating whether or not I'm not being fair on them because in the beginning they were very interested in being friends and we used to hang out practically everyday til my parents got fed up with us hanging out so much so they banned us from going to each others houses. 
 
I'm not envious very often, but today my friend went somewhere with other friends, I was genuinely happy that they were hanging out with people rather than going straight home and not talking to anyone. I felt envious that they were willing to go out with people because whenever I try to set up plans they either don't respond or say no. Trust me when I say this, I am genuinely happy that everyone is going out having fun, and bonding with one another more. 

I just feel envious because whenever I brought up the idea of staying after school even for half an hour, it's instantly ""Oh, I just want to go home"". I feel like I'm being petty and really mean saying all of this. I know I won't feel upset tomorrow but I feel like a horrible person for feeling upset.

As previous said they never seem to respond whenever I ask about hanging out. It is the exact same no matter the subject, even if I need them for 5-10 minutes to calm me down, it's always no response even if they're online. I know they don't like texting or calling but it does upset me because they are the only person I trust with my problems because of past problems. I also know they have told me to not rely on them because they don't know how to help even though sending me posts on Instagram helps me a lot and I've told them this multiple times.

I feel like I'm getting upset over nothing but most of the time it doesn't bother me anymore, I've gotten so used to no response it doesn't really mean anything. But it does upset me when I really need someone, and I don't want to keep explaining my situation to every new person I talk to about my problems. They never text me about their problems, that's always been the case, which makes me feel like I'm complaining about nothing.

So AITA for feeling upset? All responses welcome. Sorry if everything is formatted weirdly, I'm writing this on my phone. Thank you for reading this"	No A-holes here	0	0

&#x200B;

So I (32M) financially support my gf(28F) of 3 years in almost all of our expenses. I owned the home we live in far before I met her and allowed her to move in and not worry about any bills while she finishes a certification track for her particular brand of medical work. When she met me, and throughout our entire relationship, she knew I loved going to music festivals. It's my escape from real life and responsibilities and it's honestly some of the most fun I have during the year. She has made it very clear she does not like them, and has no desire to attend. Which is fine with me, people need their own individual interests! When we met, I was probably traveling around to 4/5 a year. To make expenses work and as I've gotten older, I've toned it down a bit but maintained my love for the events. 2020 was supposed to be my year to do one big festival, my absolute favorite...EDC Las Vegas. We've always talked about wanting to travel to Greece together and possibly go with another couple sometime but have had to put it off. Well, fast-forward to today, I get an email from her friend's husband about Greece trip potential itinerary, and see that the dates are already set. Low and behold, the dates in Greece are the dates I was planning to attend EDC. When I brought it up to my gf, she said threw a fit that the dates were set in stone for the other couple this was finally our opportunity to travel and do what we've talked about doing. I get her side, but her only response to my concern of attending EDC is ""music festivals are dumb and you'd be an asshole to choose that over Greece if it came down to it"".

&#x200B;

tl;dr AITA for bringing this up and feeling slighted that a Greece trip was potentially scheduled and planned w/o my knowledge and falls within the dates of an event I've already spoken in length about attending?

&#x200B;

EDIT FOR INFO: While this is not the last EDC Vegas ever, we will be getting engaged soon and married early next year. We have talked about trying to start a family soon after, so my opportunity for EDC will not come back around for a long time.

Also, I threw the part in there about financially supporting her because obtaining this state certification and being able to do the job she wants to do is her passion. It makes me very happy to support her and see her being able to thrive doing what she loves. I worded it poorly, my apologies."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5smap	2019-06-26 17:23:32	heyfrend	AITA for not defending a transwoman after she was repeatedly attacked by our group president?	"Throwaway acct.

Yesterday at work 4 of us were having a conversation about Diversity & Inclusion projects. The group :Me, a coworker, Executive Director (Sharon)and our group President (Steve). Sharon & Steve are both in elected positions, and hold a lot of power in our organisation. Steve is basically my boss’s boss.

Sharon was saying how she regretted that she did not invite any trans people to an LGBTQ+ event she hosted. One of our members, Samantha, is a transwoman and she does great work. I love Samantha- she’s kind & funny and is a powerful spokesperson. 

I suggested that we connect with her and Sharon immediately agreed. Then Steve jumped in and said: “Oh is that the guy that sits in the back corner?” 

That’s where Samantha sits so I knew he was referring to her. 

“She, yes, Samantha is her name- SHE is great, very knowledgeable—-“ But Steve cut me off:
“ He’s probably got a good perspective.”
“She,” both Sharon and I corrected again.
“Oh well I don’t know how to address these things” Steve said. “How do I know if he’s a man or a woman or whatever?”
“She,” I interrupted for a third time. “She’s a woman- her name is Samantha. That’s what I’m saying.”
But Steve wasn’t really listening because he just sort of talked over me: “Okay, okay I’ll just say ‘THEY.’ that way I don’t make a mistake. I mean how can I know these things? I mean- he looks like a guy to me.”

I was flabbergasted. I’m not sure how the conversation ended but none of us called Steve out on being so shitty. And I felt terribly afterward. 

Just to be clear Samantha is noticeably a transwoman. She dresses impeccably in feminine clothing (you know what I mean pls don’t word police me!) her makeup is always on point- she is presenting herself to the world as a woman. So I just don’t believe that Steve was genuinely confused about her gender. If he was, he could have corrected himself the first time - instead of continuing on that awful& disrespectful diatribe,  flinging his hands up in the air in this cartoonish motion of confusion.

It’s especially poignant because we were talking about Samantha in the context of being inclusive so I’m now concerned about Steve’s commitment to our stated values.

I feel ashamed for not saying more yesterday. But I’m not sure what I can do now. I haven’t worked here for long so we’re not yet very close.Many staff talk about his fragile ego and at the end of the day- he is the president. Am I making excuses? I Should have said something in the moment about the power of language &the impact of mis-gendering. I’m considering asking my boss or Sharon to speak with him. But I know that he’ll be offended and will take it out on me. Is that the right thing to do regardless? Am I the asshole for not sticking up for Sam?

Tldr: president kept mis-gendering transwoman even after corrected many times. I did not stand up for her or call him out. Am I part of the problem?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5slwx	2019-06-26 17:22:40	joannethegirl	AITA? I completely flipped out when my ex husband looked at a cottage for sale next door to mine.	"     A year and a half ago I left my husband. We are legally divorced. He kept the house that we had been paying off together for about 18 years.  I got the summer cottage that we had been paying off for 3 years.  I tried to be very generous as we both work for my father and it benefits all of us if we can continue this way. 
     Fast forward to this week.  He is on vacation a town over from my cottage.  Our 17 year old daughter is staying at my cottage with her best friend so he doesn't have to pay for a second hotel room.  She called me yesterday to tell me that her father was with a real estate agent checking out the cottage next door to mine. 
Needless to say, I was not happy.  After she told me it was ok to talk to him ( I wanted to wait until she gave me permission so he wouldn't be mad at her for telling me) I called him and lost my shit. He could not understand why there was anything wrong with him trying to buy that cottage. He said it is the best price he can find. I finally told him that I would tell everyone a horrible secret about him if he bought it. He reluctantly backed down. I feel bad that I even brought it up to him.  And I know that's blackmail. But I can't have any sanity if i have to see my ex every single day.  Am I the Asshole here?

     Also, we are both with other people now. I am engaged and he has been with the same woman since last April.  I can't imagine that anyone would have been happy with this situation.

I should add that he does not have a good relationship with our daughter.  At all.  He barely talks to her. She does not want him there either. I found out he was there because she called me up crying on the phone.
So it seems decided that I'm the asshole.  I wish that I had gone a different route to make him see what a bad idea moving next door would be.  I have talked to him and apologized for what I said."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c5skpp	2019-06-26 17:20:04	snekyyboi	AITA for wanting to invite another person to the cinema?	"Me and the lads decided to go to the cinema to watch spoderman homesick on our half day, it was set up by  Jake (not real name) and he also had a £20 voucher that allowed us 4 to pay £4 each instead of the usual £8. We all agreed that 4 people was a good amount as it wasn't too hectic like 6 people. But as the week went on we were thinking about inviting one more person as we now thought it might be better. Our main choice was Michael (not real name) but nobody wanted to pay extra (I didn't mind) so we (only 3 of us as one of them was at athletics) made a deal with him that he would pay £8 and we would pay our discounted price £4. We got home and told Mohammed (the person who wasn't there to agree on the deal) that he should invite Michael to the group chat. It is worth noting that Michael is the nicest guy in the year. He doesn't get angry, has no beef with anyone and lets you borrow things of his with no problem. But Mohammed says no. His argument that 4 is better than 5 but he never gives a specific reason for this when I ask him, he only replies what i asked him. I give valid points on how everyone thinks 5 isn't hectic and hard to do unlike having 6 people and it is better to enjoy the movie with a little more people (especially nice people like Michael) He makes me group admin and tells me to invite Michael. When I do, he leaves the group like a man-child. I end up kicking Michael as I know Jake wants the og 4 back as Mohammed is his best friend. I then invite Mohammed back. The first thing he says his might watch with (other friend) and other (friend). So AITA for wanting to invite another person to watch the movie with?

TL:DR dude argues with me that 4 people at a cinema is better than 5 and leaves when he tells me to invite the nicest dude to watch it with us. I invite him back and he says he might watch it with another friend group."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5sfh9	2019-06-26 17:08:51	bensenburrows	WIBTA if I go against my BFs wishes and buy the gift anyways?	"Me (32/F) and my BF (37/M) have been renting our house for 6 years. When we first moved in I was not overly fond of our next door neighbor (39/F) because she wears skimpy revealing clothing and acted very flirtatious towards my BF so I had my guard up. 

Over many years of living here and actually getting to know her I have grown to really like her. She can still be flirtatious sometimes but I have come to accept that it is just her personality and I trust my BF so its a non issue.

 She comes outside and barbeques, sits and talks to us in our yard on a weekly basis, we follow eachother on social media, we exchange Christmas cards, last year she bought me a birthday present,she keeps an eye on our house/property and vice versa etc etc. I dont really consider us to be like close friends but the relationship falls somewhere  between bring friends and acquaintances. 

Her 40th birthday is approaching and her sister invited us to a surprise birthday party she is throwing but we politely declined because we are going away on vacation. I mentioned to my BF that we should get her a card and a bottle of wine or something because its a milestone birthday. My BF is totally against it.

 He is adamant that we ""shouldn't get too over involved with neighbor's"", ""shouldn't spend unnecessary money"" and that he is sick of ""the neighborly gift exchange"" ( a weird thing to say because we have never given neighbors any gifts though we have received gifts).

I was only planning on spending 25$ and thought it would be a nice gesture since she does spend so much time around us, gave me a gift for my birthday and it is a milestone birthday for her. I can't see why my BF is making it such a big deal and I kind of want to say screw him and do it anyways but I also dont want us fighting over something so trivial. 

WIBTA if I go against his wishes and get Amanda a gift? 

TLDR - Our next door neighbor has become kind of like a friend to my BF and I over the years and is turning 40 soon. I want to get her a card and a small gift but my BF is against it and is adamant that we don't get her anything. WIBTA if I go against his wishes and get her a gift anyways?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

He takes a lot of pride in being intelligent, and if someone says something he thinks is stupid, he will look at them in utter disgust and refuse to talk to them. He is constantly making fun of people for being stupid, even when they weren’t actually being stupid. So proud to be related to him. He thinks very little of me and isn’t good at hiding it.

If you can’t tell already, he is absolutely insufferable. Whenever I try to give him a chance and talk to him again, he ruins my day by saying something condescending, smug and judgmental. He constantly implies to me that I got through engineering school by using my appearance (completely untrue). He has made me cry more times than I can count. He also gives me insultingly patronizing advice about how to do obvious things.

Right now, my family is vacationing so I’m forced to be around him. He’s decided to act like we’re friends again. Lol, no. Just No. He keeps happily talking to me even when I don’t reply. He doesn’t like me or want to spend time with me, he’s just putting on a show to look good in front of my family.

My family has noticed my less than warm demeanor, and apparently they all think I’m being a cunt. Yesterday my mom yelled at me, told me I’m being immature, and that the silent treatment is “borderline abusive”.

I explained to her that I avoid him because I’m tired of being hurt by him, and it is very irritating to be condescensed to 24/7. In the past, I’ve tried to explain to him why his behavior is rude, but he hasn’t changed.

c5se5l	2019-06-26 17:06:02		AITA for being angry at and shunning my family attending someone else’s celebration over mine?	"For the past couple months I have been planning a relatively big party, I haven’t had anything like this since I was 10. 
About a couple weeks ago all hell broke loose when I sent out the date and my entire extended family flipped their shit because “it’s a month after my real birthday”. I couldn’t do an earlier date because it just wasn’t possible with my schedule. On another note, I made sure it was a time where I knew it wouldn’t overlap with anything serious for them so they didn’t feel forced to move around plans for me. 
Well, they kept being really dramatic about the whole thing to the point I just straight out asked “what the fuck?!” To my aunt.


Turns out, the real reason they’re acting this way is because of my Step-grandmother. My date for the party apparently lands on her “birthday month” and on that exact weekend this old Women who is not even fully married to my grandfather is going to be celebrating her birthday (Along with every other weekend that month), and I’m impeding on these plans. 

Okay, that’s fine and all, I’d kinda understand my grandfather not attending my party because of this, but literally my entire family is going to her thing instead.

I feel like this Women, who is not even a blood relative, is turning everyone against me and only decided to announce her celebration AFTER I did. 

Whenever I share my aggravation about this with people they don’t really give me any input or look away, so I need someone with a clean slate to tell me, AITA? 

Tl;dr Step-grandmother celebration falls on same date as my party, everyone is attending hers, and I’m angry about it."		1	0

I don’t mind the insurance and phone as much as I do the rent. She charges my older brother $250 for rent. That’s it. And he makes more than I do. When I tried to say something she said I was being ungrateful. I don’t think I am, I think I’m be cheated and I don’t want to pay her that much. It’s half my paycheck. I’m trying to save up and I have to use ~$250 for therapy and gas to work. Not to mention she wants to get the community items and my own groceries.

Edit for additional information: I turned 18 in May and I’m moving out of state in December for school. She said the reason I’m being charged more is because she “has to remind me to do chores” (quotes from the text she sent me). In the past she has let my older sister stay rent free in order to save to travel Europe. I also don’t have any rights to the things I’m paying for. I may be paying for her car insurance but she can take the car away for any reason. Same with my phone even though she’s charging me for it. If I’m paying for things like car insurance and a phone bill then I want security that I’ll have access to them. I wouldn’t have a problem otherwise."	Not enough info	0	0
c5sddk	2019-06-26 17:04:23		AITA for spending my own money that I earned?	"Sorry for using a spare account as I have family members who use reddit.

&#x200B;

A bit of background: I'm from an Asian country with a conservative dad, while my mom is rather open-minded. I'm 19 and has been studying abroad for 1.5 years, started working part-time while studying for 1 year now. 

&#x200B;

My parents divorced more than 10 years ago and my mom is the sole support financially and mentally while I'm studying abroad. When I first came to study abroad, I was underage and therefore does not have the right to work part-time, at the time my mom would be paying all my tuition, rent as well as sending me a small amount each month for food etc...

&#x200B;

My parents both have good jobs and make good money, I however like to be independent and as soon as my bday comes, I started working part-time as a waitress. After 2 months and finally seeing me being capable of supporting myself, I told my mom to stop sending me money (meaning she only has to pay for my rent and tuition fee). 

&#x200B;

Now, I enjoy being able to support myself, and work hard to buy what I want, going out...without having to ask my parents of be dependent on anyone. None of my parents asked me to find a job in the first place, I did it all because I wanted it, and also to support my mom as she is the sole supporter for me and I would love to share the burden with her.

&#x200B;

Long story short, some months I work more than others and earned quite a bit of money, allowing myself to buy some high-end stuffs that I really like, but nothing too much as I remember I'm feeding myself in a foreign country. I was also able to save money for trips with friends and my bf, and whenever I go back to my country for the summer I spend my own money that I saved. 

&#x200B;

Now, I came to know that my mom somehow think I'm wrong for spending my money on stuffs for myself etc. She was thinking of sending me only half the rent from now on since I appear to be ""very rich"". Bare in mind, I live in a big city, and I've been paying for my own food, transports,... while maintaining a good record at uni. Some weeks I work way less when the boss doesn't need me or when I have exams to focus on, but I always try to make enough. 

&#x200B;

The news breaks my heart as I initially started the job with the intention to help my mom, and also a young person's natural wish to buy herself stuffs with her own money. I have no idea how to talk with my mom as she might take offense, I;m also not a person who talk back to my parents or like speaking up for myself. I also think that being able to buy stuffs I like, or gifts is nothing too ""rich"" as I always kept a saving in case there's a trip, or for when I go back home for summer.

Since getting engaged a year ago, both me (25F) and my fiance (26M) have agreed we don't want kids outside of the flower girls and ring bearers to be at the wedding. Partially because we don't like kids but also because the wedding would be overrun by kids if they were all invited. Flash forward to sending out invitations. On the invitations I made sure to put the names of everyone invited- for example the cousin in this story lives with her husband, mother and 3 kids (all under 4). So on their invitation I put Sally Smith, Jane & Joe Doe. I had all of my guests RSVP online. Again only Sally Smith, Jane Doe and John Doe were listed online to RSVP for. 

&#x200B;

I had a hunch that Jane would bring her kids regardless, so I had my SIL reach out to them. And I was right. They were planning on bringing the kids. Now they keep posting passive aggressive posts on FB complaining how she needs a babysitter and how she doesn't know if she is going to the wedding any more. 

&#x200B;

I think I am NTA, because my wedding, my rules, BUT there is one AH thing I am not sure what to do about. As I mentioned, only the flower girls and ring bearers were invited.... but I also invited my cousin's 2 kids (aged 4 months and 2 years). I am close with my cousin and she is traveling from out of state to come to the wedding. If her kids wouldn't have been invited, she couldn't come. 

&#x200B;

For a couple of years in a row I would always go and travel to their city as it was 1) a city I've always wanted to visit and really enjoyed and 2) always had a place to stay as my friend would always let me stay at their place.  
They would also come back here as they still have a lot of friends where I live now - however I was never able to offer them a place to stay as I lived with family and there wasn't space to host them and they also had other friends to rely on to stay with. I have since moved out and now live with my S.O.   
My S.O and I live in a ""1-bed"" apartment but it is super tiny, less than 600 sq ft and it's more like a studio but there are doors in the bedroom.  My S.O. and friend don't know each other as the friend moved away just as I was beginning to see my partner.   
My friend recently asked me if they could stay with me as they need to come up for an event in October and they know I've moved out and now live with my partner. They are staying for a shortish amount of time 4 days.  
WIBTA if I told them they can't stay with me even though they had always let me stay with them when I went to visit because a) there's no room for three people in a tiny  apartment b) I don't have a spare bed so they would ultimately have to sleep on the couch and c) my friend and S.O don't know each other well so it would make things awkward and put an imposition on my partner.  
I would gladly accept them if I lived on my own but as it's just not my apartment makes this difficult. WIBTA?"		1	0

* I came to America to work, met and married my (American) husband here, and live here with him and our kids
* My family (parents, siblings, etc) lives back in my home country
* I get 3 weeks of holiday a year and when I go on holiday is when I go back to my home country, with my husband and children of course
* I always do 1 week in December and then 2 weeks in June
* I  always celebrate Christmas in my home country
* My MIL recently complained that my family gets to ""hog"" Christmas. While I understand that she wants to spend Christmas with us, she gets to celebrate every single other holiday with us (Easter, Thanksgiving, New Year, July 4th, every birthday) and sees her grandchildren every week
* Also, if I were to stay in the US during my 1 week Christmas holiday, then I'd essentially be ""wasting"" my opportunity to see my family back home and so only see them 2 weeks a year in June
* Flying my parents here for Christmas would be a headache, mostly because they take of my senile grandmother (and I can't fly *her* out because new places confuse her greatly)
* That being said, I do understand my MIL's desire to celebrate Christmas with us, but I feel like it's compensated by...basically everything else.

c5s71t	2019-06-26 16:50:38	gylabrand	AITA for trying to be friends with an ex-girlfriends boyfriend?	"Last october, I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years because of a number of relationship issues we had. It wasn’t horribly ugly by any means but she was absolutely devastated at first. It was very difficult for me as I truly did love her but I thought it was for the best. We continued to try and be friends because we had been friends for years before starting to date. 

For the next few months before we finished undergrad we still hung out regularly and would hook up. After graduation she moved across country and started dating someone else. We still would talk on the phone from time to time. 

Then around early December, we talked for a few minutes on the phone but she was very brief and I could tell she didn’t want to talk so I let her go and figured that was that. She came home for the holidays and a group of our friends from HS got together at the bar. Her and I were there and we had a great time. This was the first time I had seen her since she moved but we were both respectful of each other and she told me that she would be home for her brothers graduation and our class reunion. 

A few moths pass. It’s her brothers graduation party. I stop by and talked with my exgf for a bit, and met her new boyfriend for the first time. He was very nice and I liked him right away. Well a few of us were going to the bar again so I invited my exgf and her bf to come with us, and they went.

When they got there I have already had a few, and right away I tell him I want to buy him a drink. We do the old ‘you don’t have to, oh but I want to’ gag but he accepts and we stand at the bar for a solid 45 minutes just talking getting to know each other and what not. Now, I will admit that at times, especially when drinking I can push other people to partake, but I can definitely take a hint as well if someone doesn’t want to. Maybe I clearly ignored all the warning signs but I though we were getting along great. 

Next day, I host the class reunion at my house. My exgf does not say a word to me. We have done extensive amounts of remodeling since she has even been in the house. She doesn’t say anything about that, not thanking me for hosting, nothing. Her boyfriend barely said hello. 

Next day, a few friends of mine come over to help clean up. They start telling me that my exgf walked up to them at the bar two nights ago, when I was talking to her bf, and asked them if I was trying to drug her boyfriend and what kind of game I was playing. I would literally never do that. I get that she might have been uncomfortable with us talking because it’s two guys from two very different parts of her life, but I honestly don’t see anything wrong with what I did. I haven’t talked to her since. 

TL;DR My exgf, who I thought I was still friends with, was in town and I tried to be friends her boyfriend by hanging out with him at the bar. She thought I was trying to drug him."	No A-holes here	0	0

"I (23M) was raised religious, Muslim more specifically, but I've been identifying as agnostic since admitting to myself that I'm gay as few years ago. However despite my changed attitude towards faith, I haven't been able to drink alcohol or eat pork. For some reason, probably a deeply ingrained belief, I can't get over my discomfort associated with those things.

The reason this might be an issue is because I was invited to a local beer festival by a group of friends from my university course. I accepted because I've been pushing myself to hang out more instead of playing video games like a hermit all day. Plus the guy I'm into will be there.

So the problem: these people know I'm not religious, so I'm assuming they'll expect me to go through the taste testing and drink with them. But I don't feel comfortable with the idea, though I'd love to spend time together.

Would I be the asshole/party-breaker at least if I refused to drink? Maybe I should just stay at home to avoid making the situation awkward for everyone involved?"	No A-holes here	0	0

"My friend bought a house and his housewarming ended up being a sort of once-a-year catch up for friends of his and mine that sort of never made time to really catch up. So good friends from the past, but not so close now.

Naturally everyone's sharing life updates, and I brought along a couple of big ones to the table that I didn't know how to share without them possibly being a little jealous. First that the company I was an early engineer at was successfully acquired and that made me moderately wealthy (lockout period blah blah not withstanding) and that after a couple of years after my divorce I was finally in a steady relationship once more. My girlfriend is somewhat younger than me but not by much (42 to 25) and whatever mistakes I made with my last marriage and relationship, I'm looking to put them aside and do much better with this one. Luckily no kids in the mix.

Unfortunately I felt constantly under attack from a small set of friends and sadly, their family too. Too many robbing the cradle jokes, and how my acquisition apparently had other terms and conditions (referring to my girlfriend being a gold digger). About an hour or so and a few beers in, I just about had enough, and called out a few friends and their wives for being jealous and not being able to share in my success. Which is a shame, because at least the husbands were with me supporting me when my career was tanking and my marriage in the shitter not too long ago. 

I stormed out, created a bit of a scene (only words) and left. The host later called me and told me that what I did was immature and uncalled for, and he wished I had a better sense of humor. I don't know ladies and gentlemen, am I supposed to be forever immune to jokes about how I can afford top quality mail-order brides or whatever now that I've got an extra digit in my bank account or cradle robbing jokes (like how the software at my company might be older than her ... ) forever?

c5s0gz	2019-06-26 16:35:18		AITA - Family said they would help, yet always let down.	"AITA 

I am a 30 years old educated man and recently got engaged. My family is fairly well off as we own a very successful business, of which I have no involvement.  I have other siblings who are or have been involved in the family business and have each received help to purchase homes early off in life. Growing up I always heard my family say things like ""when you get married we'll help you kids buy a home."" 

&#x200B;

Well fast forward to present day, I asked my father a couple months ago to either help my fiance and I gain ownership by gifting us down payment for a home or lending us a personal mortgage we could afford, and he said yes. At which time my fiance and I began the search with a Realtor. We found something, however my father recommended we spend more and look at something bigger so we wouldn't have to move when we decide to grow the family. So we continued to look. Finally when we found one we liked and could afford payments on, we again asked my father for assistance, at which time he lied and said that he never assured me and that I would be best to ask my Grandfather (the business owner).

&#x200B;

My grandfather is a multi millionaire and has said he has never made less than 1 MIL in a year since the 90's, but he's no family man. I know 100% he has helped my other brothers when they wanted a home. So anyway I manned up and explained my situation with my 6 year old son and my new fiance, told him why we are looking for a home had he flat out ignored every word and said ""NO, my girlfriend isn't employed full-time"" and if i want to talk more about it to ask my dad. Then he did what he always does with his clients yeah, OK, Bye and then hangs up abruptly without give me a chance to say anything.

&#x200B;

This isn't the first time I've been treated with disrespect. He would never let me be involved with the family business in my adult life besides the odd cash jobs, even when my father threatened to leave the business. I have education and experience, but have an invisible disability that will prevent me from ever obtaining insurance.

&#x200B;

My fiance was beside herself as she was called an unemployed girlfriend by the family and my ego was yet again destroyed. The next day I returned the vehicle they helped me purchase and I have decided to shield my new fiance and my son away from their twisted morals forever and haven't spoke with anyone of them as a result since. I have received texts but instantly I delete them. When this blew up it was the Wednesday before Father's Day. I messaged my grandma and my mom to explain what was said between us men and I apologized to both mom and grandpa thinking they would understand my point, however neither responded until I receive a little ""Happy Fathers Day"" text that Sunday. 

&#x200B;

After many years of mistreatment, misappropriation of family love, disrespectful comments, and polarization because of an illness. I have decided to be done with them and am sick of making any attempts toward a healthier relationship.

c5rzta	2019-06-26 16:33:47	ilmBianca2000	WIBTA to come up with a lie so that my mom would let me go on a city break with a friend?	"I (19F) have never visited a foreign city before, mostly because I had no friends in teenage years, so I only went with my family on holidays at the seaside - staying endless hours on the beach everyday and then returning to the hotel with no other interesting activities in our schedule. 

Now I want to go abroad to visit a city with someone of the same age. I met this boy on Tinder two years ago and we’ve been talking since then. Given the fact that now he lives with his parents in other country, we couldn’t meet in person for too many times, but even so, we get along well. 

We planned on going to Vienna this summer and we were excited about it, but my mother would be probably worried about me going on a long distance with a boy she doesn’t know anything about. 

I honestly don’t fancy the idea of introducing him to my mom, because I know that there would be a long line of questioning and stupid remarks  - is he your boyfriend, how did you meet him, where do his parents work at, he looks too skinny, I don’t like him etc. I hate that and I’ve never told my family anything whenever I liked a boy only for this reason: I hate questions. 

Unfortunately, my friend’s mom can’t talk to mine because she doesn’t speak very well our language, so that would be complicated. 

WIBTA to come up with a lie and say that I’ll go with a classmate or any other girl? 

TL;DR: I want to go on a city break with a boy that mom doesn’t know anything about and I don’t want to introduce him to her because I hate annoying questions and I would feel awkward.

PS: He came to my country one week ago and we stayed together in the same rented apartment - he’s a nice guy and he has always been, with no bad intentions."	Asshole	0	0

I told her that it was mean of her not to apologize, and I was trying to hold that stance, but shes absolutely hysterically crying.

 I don't want to sit here and cuddle her and tell her everything's okay because she'll just pick up this behavior as an okay thing. But at the same time shes a sweet little girl and shes afraid because shes ""in trouble"".

c5rznw	2019-06-26 16:33:28	quakquak777	AITA for hating my depressed brother	"So I need to give a little backstory before I go onto the actual post so people understand.

 I come from a family of 6 and on both sides we have a history of mental illness mainly depression.  All of us kids were diagnosed with depression at different times in our lives. We have all been given meds and stuff, but there is favoritism for my brother. When I was diagnosed I was still treated like how I was before; I still had to do dishes, I still had to sweep and do other chores. My brother isn't asked to do those things anymore and he spends all day sleeping and then at night he comes downstairs to make himself food while using a whole bunch of dishes. That really bugs me because he doesn't do dishes and it's frustrating to clean up all of the messes he makes while he goes off doing whatever. He also eats all of the snack food we buy. We'll buy some food specifically for a special occasion or for a certain person in the family and then he'll eat all of it. We've told him to stop but at this point I think he doesn't care. He also doesn't help us with the dogs which are pretty high maintenance and my dad wakes my sister up at 5 am every morning to watch them.

I've told my dad about how he favors my brother several times but he says that because he's so depressed he doesn't have to do anything.

Am I the asshole for hating my brother?





Edit: I've discussed with my father before about how I feel but he says to suck it up. My brother won't talk to anyone at all and is generally really moody and rude.




Edit 2: I thought a list of what chores we do would be helpful.

c5ryv7	2019-06-26 16:31:45	matiuhhh	AITA for preferring my dad’s company over my mom’s?	"So, context: I’m 20 and have been living with my mom since January this year (transferring colleges, working, that kind of thing is easier when living at home). In April, my dad started staying in a motel because he wanted to be away from my mom. Currently, he’s in an apartment, and the two are going through couple’s therapy while being “separated.” They have their own issues that they try to keep me out of, but I’m right in the middle either way.

My issue is that I’ve been kind of preferring my dad’s company over my mom’s. I don’t see him as often as I used to (maybe 3 times a week instead of every day), and I’ve always found it easier to talk to him about anything and everything. We’re just very similar. 

Meanwhile, my mom wants to do things with me, and I WANT to want to do things with her, but sometimes, she grates on me. (I had this issue in high school too.) She cries every day and night, gets extremely anxious (which hurts my anxiety), and just has little behaviors that irrationally irritate me. 

I try to hang out with her when I can. I’m just overly cautious because one time, when hanging out with my dad, she broke down and started screaming about how I was neglecting her and my dad was “stealing” me away. This was a month ago, but it still hangs over my head. I was 19 at the time; my dad was not stealing me, and I feel like I shouldn’t have to carry the emotional burden of my 50 year old mother’s marital issues when I have severe mental illness already. [Note: I’m not asking for advice about this situation. I was just trying to give more context about how strained the situation has become, and we’ve tried to resolve this issue as best we can. Both my parents were being assholes in this scenario.]

c5rygc	2019-06-26 16:30:54		AITA for for getting angry and cutting contact with one of my best friends ?	"I knew this guy for 15-16 years. Best friends from school. But since he was 21/22 he changed. He was always trying to show off and put other people down since high school. He went to study maths, and used this as a reason to do the same. It got tiring after a while listening to him talking down to people that came from other education  backgrounds, such as marketing/hr/philosophy, for some reason if it wasn't maths or anything related to STEM he would act as the other person was inferior. He used as an excuse that he could only communicate with people from that background.

&#x200B;

Things got worse when he met this woman 6 years older than him and has been with her for the past 8 years (since he was 21/22 I think). He had zero past experience when it came to dating before that. She is average at best and has a numerous health problems. He gained tons of weight in the past years, to the point where if he loses it he will probably have loose skin. I get it it is his life he can fuck it up. 

&#x200B;

But he gives me advices about relationships, sometimes he raises his voice aswell to emphasise that his point is right. Most of the time what he says does not make sense, and I am trying to figure out if I am a retard or if he is just full of shit.

&#x200B;

When I got accepted to study maths (master's degree) and I told my other friends and he was there listening and smirking. You could tell that he did that in a very patronising way. 

In whatever subject we talk about he always has to mention that he did that or this first, he knew about this first. Even if he did who cares ? Most of the time there is no point, it is like he says it because he needs to.

&#x200B;

I work out and I try to invest to myself as much as possible. I read stuff, and I try to share things to him, he does not  show any interest and the worst part is that he expresses his opinions with NO prior knowledge about the subject. Why ? 

&#x200B;

I asked him numerous times if he is planning to lose weight, since he recently had some bad blood tests results, and he just wont move his ass. He always comes up with an excuse to skip the gym. And on top of that he pretends to be strong and that he could take any of us down anytime. I helped him move his stuff 3 years ago, and he was out of breath after 2 minutes... I thought he was going to get a heart attack.

&#x200B;

I dont get if I should be more patient with him or not, but it has gotten into my nerves so I just told him off one day that his unhealthy lifestyle is not something I agree with and that we have nothing in common anymore because of the choices he made in his life. He said that he will not change even when I laid all the facts in front of him. Then I just hung up and blocked his number."	Not the A-hole	1	0

The woman he's marrying is pregnant, technically making it 13.

This is marriage 4 and of all 13 kids, there are 6 different mothers. Every child has been invited to this wedding. I have only met the 18y/o step brother and my full siblings, the others I've only heard about in passing.

My relationship with dad is tricky at best. He and mum were on and off while me and my full siblings were younger, and when he was at home there was basically always a 50/50 chance he'd be in a good mood or a bad one. When he was in a good mood things were fine. When he was in a bad mood it was awful. When I was 10 I hit puberty, and he took my bedroom door off it's hinges in case I brought a boy home. If my room was ever the slightest bit messy (so much as a t shirt on the floor) he'd come in and pull my things off shelves and out of drawers saying ""if you want to live in a dump I'll help you on your way"". He never hit me but he would call me names and put me down, and it lasted until mum divorced him when I was 11. When I was 16, I told him I was a lesbian, and he didn't say anything, just got up and left, and I didn't hear from him after that until a year ago. To this day, he has never shown remorse for his actions.

The kids under 18 don't have much of a choice in going to the wedding as he has at least partial custody of all of them, but the ones over 12 get more of a say than the ones under 12. As I'm 20, I don't have to go. However, my younger siblings (the full ones) have said they are all going and would love for me to be there, and dad has also rung me and asked me to come. He even said I could bring my girlfriend as a +1. He also said that when I get there, ""we should have a long talk, somewhere private. I know I haven't always been the best dad but I have some stuff I need to get off my chest"".

The wedding is at a church and the reception is at a hotel, both about a 2 hour drive from mine and my girlfriend's place. Dad has offered to pay for the room, cover any bar or room service, and give us gas money. We'd be driving there a few days before the wedding for wedding prep eg rehearsal dinners and leaving the morning after the reception. Both me and my girlfriend are on summer break from uni and work remotely, so we could easily go, work in the hotel room between events, and not lose any work/money.

While my attitude to dad is complicated at best, he has some stuff he wants to say to me and my girlfriend thinks I should hear him out, and my younger siblings, who I love and would do anything for, really want me to come.

The wedding is a few months away and I'm still undecided as to what I'm doing.

My dad has an older son (in his mid 30’s) from a previous relationship who I didn’t see much growing up. He has 2 kids, a 9 year old son and an 11 year old daughter. I don’t really know what’s appropriate to say in front of kids etc because I literally don’t know them and have never been around kids. I’m an only child from my mom and dad.

My parents invited my brother and his family as well a lot of other people to our place for a bbq. There was a giant climbing wall hired amongst other things for entertainment which included guides, protective gear, etc.

My brothers kids were really excited to take part in the activities and my nephew scaled the wall like a literal monkey. My niece struggled and couldn’t get past the first few foot holds.

She is very very fat, which regardless of my personal feelings about childhood obesity I would never laugh at her about it, but she came up to me and sat down at the bench and said  ‘I couldn’t climb that wall.’

I didn’t really know what to say, so I just said sorry. And then she asked how come she couldn’t do it. I replied that it was probably because she was chunkier than her brother which I didn’t really think was a negative adjective to use, and I didn’t know what else to say. 

Her mom was there and immediately said ‘uh, that’s really rude wow, my daughter is NOT chunky’ and then told my niece she couldn’t climb the wall because it was hot and her hands were probably slippery with sweat. 

Before I got the chance to apologize to either she walked off with her daughter. Later on my mom told me that she had told my brother who had complained to my dad. My dad said ‘well, your kid IS a lot chunkier than nephew, OP didn’t say anything wrong’ which prompted my brother and his family to leave the bbq early without saying goodbye. 

I really just feel like I suck and I want to apologize to my parents for putting them in this spot but also my brother and his family. My mom and dad are pretty annoyed with my brother though and feel like he & his wife don’t live in reality. However my dad is kinda old and my mom and he are pretty conservative and can be quite harsh sometimes so I don’t think they’re being fully fair here.

c5rvwf	2019-06-26 16:24:58		AITA for going to a friends house instead of doing yard work?	"My living situation is a bit odd, but my parents passed away when I was young, and I now live with my girlfriend and older sister (who practically raised me).

I’d like to start out by saying that we both have our own issues after the death of our parents. I have recently overcome depression, my sister has very little empathy and is quick to anger.

My main job in the house is to do the yard work (because I’m the man says my sister). The yard needed mowed Monday, but I caught a flu, so I spent the whole day in bed and told my sister I would do it IF I felt better the next day.

The next day I was still feeling just as sick, and called off of work. Everybody else in the house went to work, so I was home alone. My friend said I shouldn’t be home alone so he offered for me to go to his house, relax, and catch up on tv shows. So I spent the entire day as his house, relaxing on his couch and watching tv/socializing.

My sister comes home, realizes the yard isn’t mowed, and freaks out. Calling me over and over, sending personal insults over text about how I’m not a “real man”. And my girlfriend (who is a lot nicer) is on her side.


Their reasoning is that if I were really sick, I would have stayed home and not went to hangout with my friend. If I was well enough to spend the day with him, I should have been well enough to go to work and mow the lawn.


My reasoning, is that it shouldn’t matter if I stayed at home and rested all day or if I went to my friends and rested. By going over there, I had company and somebody that cooked for me. And just because I’m well enough to drive 10 minutes, that does not mean I’m well enough to do 2+ hours of yard work in the hot (95 degrees yesterday) Florida sun.


So am I the asshole here? If you leave the house when you’re sick, does that give enough reason for people to doubt an illness?

I also wasn't able to afford a car or the insurance payments for one, so I haven't yet gotten my driver's license and rely of either my mother/step-dad or lyft/uber to get around. I also work as a server for my mother at the restaurant she manages, if that changes anything for you guys

&#x200B;

So I have bumps on my finger, that at the time I thought were just callouses. Mother ends up seeing them one day and gets concerned that there something more serious(possibly cancer? She never outright said it but a few members on her side had gotten cancer and she herself had a scare so I think this may have been her primary concern) but I tell her I have had them for so long that if it was cancer it probably would have already killed me. She says something about going to the doctor to be sure and I go on my merrily day. I check with a few co-workers as well as some people who are going to nursing school and the common consensus was that it was either warts or callouses.

&#x200B;

Next day she tells me she scheduled for a doctor's appointment on my day off and I after talking about I finally relented and agreed to go to ease her concerns. However the day before I ask for money to pay for the co-pay(since I was also on her insurance) as well as money for the lyft/uber I need to get there. She tells me I should just pay for it since I have my own money now and she is paying all of my bills. I tell her since the only reason I agreed to go was to ease her concerns about it, that I shouldn't be the one to pay. She kinda of breaks the conversation off after this point and I just give up and resign myself to paying for it.

&#x200B;

I ended up getting there today, and after the doctor takes a few minutes to see me confirms that its just warts and says I should be able to just deal with it with over the counter medicine. I am now even more annoyed then I was before because it was a few hours of my day off wasted and money that I had to pay for something to ease someone's elses concerns. It was only 48$, but as someone who is probably going to be struggling for cash after I pay off my tuition and books, 48$ can go a long way.

&#x200B;

So was I the asshole for asking for the money?

&#x200B;

Edit: Going to go ahead and add that these warts DO NOT look like normal warts. The doctor told me that and it was part of the reason I mistook them as callouses - while they feel like warts they look like callouses. No one I have been in frequent contact with his reported having warts either."	Asshole	0	0

c5ru2b	2019-06-26 16:20:38	frowdren	AITA for tipping 97 cents	"I went out for breakfast with some friends this morning, we ordered, we ate. The service was average at best but it was in the morning and likely first shift so whatever.

When it came time to pay, we were paying for each meal separately and the waitress brought us to the front. When everyone was paying, there was an extra meal that none of us ordered that we had to argue with her to remove from the bill. Then the register stopped working so she had us follow her to the register in the kitchen.

Only 1 of us payed with a card, and when he did, as he was signing the bill, she said ""oh so no tip?"" and my friend politely told her he was leaving a cash tip on the table. I thought it was rude and unconventional to hound him for a tip like that. I payed last so I was holding on to my receipt for a while, I knew my meal was $14.03. I payed with a 20 dollar bill and she gave me 5 dollars in change, so I asked her to pull up my receipt again as I was given 97 cents less than I was supposed to.

She said ""Do you really need this dollar?"" And I told her yeah she didn't give me the right amount of change. Then she rolled her eyes and said ""fine"". She pulled out a dollar and asked if any of us have 3 cents and at that point we had been standing there for 10 minutes and seeing as none of us had 3 cents I told her to keep the money as her tip (I said it pretty snappy) and basically stormed out of the place. As we were leaving she yelled ""Oh, WOW, thank you SO MUCH for that tip. I APPRECIATE IT!"" In a really sarcastic and rude tone. That 97 cents ended up being the entire tip for all 6 of our meals, around $70.

&#x200B;

As we got in the car I felt really guilty that she got such a small tip especially seeing some posts on this sub how you should always tip well since that's how waiters make their money. AITA for tipping 97 cents?

c5rts6	2019-06-26 16:20:00	TorkoalTheHutt	AITA for not wanting to share my graduation party with my mom?	"So for context, I'm graduating high school next year and she's graduating from her master's program in social work. She's what I would call a narcissistic parent, here's the link to a subreddit that describes the term and has different stories of what those kinds of parents act like  [https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/)  .  My mom is also extremely Christian and my dad's extremely Islamic so it just makes it hard to live with them and be myself around them with their ultra-conservative viewpoints on language, dress, media, etc.

&#x200B;

But anyway we were in the car with my dad talking about how I'm graduating soon and we need to start thinking about what I want to do for my graduation party. Considering my parents are divorced and my mom is on welfare, I didn't even think twice about the reality that my dad would be the one paying for most everything with the party, so I wanted to keep that in mind. As we started discussing different ideas and referenced my brothers' graduation party (he's 23 now so it was a  few years ago), she chimed in that we should share a space and have one party for the both of us since we're graduating at the same time. I was thrown off by that idea completely and reacted with  one  big  no  way.

&#x200B;

My first and main issue with that is that I do not like her friends and don't want them at my party. She is friends with everyone in her divorced singles bible study group and honestly, I've come to realize that any sort of person in a divorced singles bible study group isn't going to be the best person. She's been to church after church getting butt-hurt over the people in those groups being nosy/rude/bad influence/etc and it makes me feel extremely unsafe when I've been anywhere near them

&#x200B;

Next is that she gets offended when I have a good time with anyone but her. I truly despise her and never show any emotion around her. She's a bully and so conservative that I can't talk about anything that I like or say any jokes because I'd get the lecture of a lifetime. She dropped our netflix subscription for a Christian alternative called pureflix because she hated all the cussing and sex that was in all the other shows. Now keeping this in mind, my sense of humor is just like anyone else my age, inappropriate, dark, and full of random references. If she heard me talking the way I do to my friends, I'd be dead. And although it's inevitable that she's gonna be at my party, I don't want her near me or my friends like she would be if we were all together at one table. And that's exactly what she said her vision was of ""our"" party.

&#x200B;

I know that was a lot and there are other details but really I plan on cutting her out of my life once I begin college and I don't want my potentially last time with all my friends gathered together to be ruined by her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5rrnu	2019-06-26 16:15:14		AITA for looking out for my friend?	"There's a lot to this story, but I'm going to try and make it as quick as possible.

I have this friend, Todd. Todd and I have been good friends for a long time. Recently, I received a job at the same company as Todd. This company is notorious for their great compensation. Todd let me stay with him while I found a place (new city).

Now Todd has a SO, Julie. With me staying at Todd's house, I saw Julie a lot. Julie is a **very** outgoing person and it wasn't before long that her and I became very good friends. Always chatting online, making jokes, being goofs..etc. I have to stress that we would talk about *anything*, there was no limit. Shortly after, Julie introduced me to one of her friends, Mel, to try and set us up together. Mel and I began going out. 

Now the issue. Todd had been having a rough go at work. Things just weren't going his way and he had enough. He decided he was going to begin his own web-dev business. Now for you programmers out there, Todd was fresh to web dev. He only knew basic HTML and nothing more. So he hit a point with his current work where he was at a ""I need to get out of here"" mentality. I started to get worried because as I noted, our job is very generous to it's employees. I didn't want him to give up such an opportunity on a rash decision. Also, Julie and Todd were going to move in together and about to take on a lot of financial burdens (renovations). So thinking he was on the brink of quitting, I messaged Julie and asked her what she thought of the whole situation. How he was going to leave his job to venture in an industry he has no experience. I care for both of them and I wanted to know what she thought because this had all happened so fast she could have not known he was actually going to quit. Like she could talk some sense into him, you know? I had been telling him he needed to understand his market and gain a little more knowledge before committing full time, but he never listened. So I honestly thought she could talk some sense into him.

This set everything off. One single message I sent to her and things flew off the handle. She completely stopped talking to me, the next day Todd wouldn't look at me.

Remember Mel, the girl I was seeing? The plans we had suddenly got cancelled and I never saw her again. Not going to lie I definitely felt like the asshole and immediately tried to mend things together. The comment I had made was taken way out of context and the effect it had on my relationships with those people really hurt me.

Fast forward to about 2 months later, Todd is hosting a party and invites all my friends except for me. Quoting that Julie still isn't over my comment to her. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole for asking my friends girlfriend what she thought about his idea to leave his well paying job to start a business in an area he has never worked in?"		1	0

c5rrdy	2019-06-26 16:14:35		AITA for defending myself on the bus in front of Gf	"Okay, so this happened a while ago - on a bus. For context, the bus was on the way to her house: me (15M) and Gf (16F) on her (kind of) school bus. It isn’t her normal bus, but we get it to hers as we go to two different schools and it’s the only one I can sneak on and be allowed on. 
So, it all started when we got onto the bus; her mates were also present, as were a group of slightly (1 year) younger kids on the bus. They started throwing pieces of paper and things at us, for no reason. I assumed it’s immaturity but I don’t think that excuses their actions. I asked them to stop multiple times, to which (knowing school kids - albeit not all) they carried on. They did it more after then and started throwing more shit at us. Subsequently, I got infuriated and continued to ask them to stop. They then began to hurl insults at me, to which I insulted them back. we continued to insult each other as you do, until the bus almost reached our destination.  One in particular wouldn’t stop, a ‘leader’ if you will, so I got up of my seat and squared up to him. (me) Ready to fight, he sat back down to which I did too. Then, I began to question what he’d do when his mates were gone and he was alone; just me and him... anyways, threatening in may be, he sat down and appeared to - if you will - shit himself. Anyways, as I was getting off the bus he said ‘yeah walk off’, like I had any choice. Then, I turned and squared up to him again, this time worryingly tempted to punch him - again, he backed down and I got off. One of his mates got off too - his group (of 5ish) didn’t do much, except the ‘leader’. The guy was on the other side of the road, and me, being pissed off, began to stare at him in a slightly sadistic manner (to intimidate him), to which he began to plead ‘I’m so sorry, are you ok mate, please it wasn’t me’ then he ran off. 

I’d say ESH, but they were bullies (i was told) and did it frequently, but stopped after what happened. had to cut short due to char limit - hope it’s enough"		1	0

c5roz2	2019-06-26 16:09:03	slowdayyyy	WIBTA for no longer bringing my dogs to an event?	"Hi All,

So myself and a few friends are planning on going to a park on Saturday. I said I might bring one of my dogs as I know one of the friends adores dogs but can’t have any of his own cos his wife hates them. 
2 of the friends then made comments such as “they’re dirty” “I might go somewhere else instead” “I don’t want them to come near me”. 
So myself and the friend were of course trying to defend dogs whilst one of them said they used to like dogs but no longer do. 

I said well “in 5 years I’m no longer going to like children and will say they’re dirty and don’t come near me.” One of them said “no one is forcing you to like kids” I said “I know no one is and in fact I do like them but if someone has/likes something I don’t think it’s nice for people to say it’s dirty or don’t come near me regardless of what the subject matter is”. 

It really offended me. I know not everyone sees dogs in the same way. But my dogs are like family to me. I may never have children so they are like my children. And they know how much I care about animals. 

I am thinking now not to take my dogs because it would be so awkward and perhaps not to even go myself. I wasn’t that keen in the first place and even less so now. WIBTA for not going and for the comments made? Am I just in thinking what they said was a bit offensive?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c5rok6	2019-06-26 16:08:13	lizzovswedding	WIBTA if I go to a concert instead of my cousin's wedding?	"8 of my girlfriends and I just committed - and bought tickets - to a Lizzo concert in October. I am extremely excited about this. I spend all summer traveling for work at a fairly intense job and I work with all men so I cherish my women friends and the time I get to spend with them. Quite a few of them are scattered across the country so this is a big deal that we'll all be together. The concert is out of town so it'll be a weekend excursion and it's something to look forward to during a summer of long, hot work days.

I called my mom yesterday and mentioned the concert and she told me that my cousin's wedding is the very next day across the country. I told I hadn't received an invite and she said that her and my dad had received a ""save the date"" card last week that was meant for my entire immediate family. I'm 28 and live on the other side of the country from my parents so it's a little strange I didn't get my own invite, I think. 

I'm torn. I obviously can't attend both events. I think I'm going to skip out on the wedding for a couple of reasons:

1. I have an enormous extended family with over 50 cousins on my mom's side. I already have to pick and choose which weddings I attend due to work obligations and financial limitations (those weddings I generally feel less bad about skipping because it's for less frivolous reasons like attending a concert). The family has been averaging 2-3 weddings per year for the past 5 years or so.

2. I'm not close with this particular cousin. We really hadn't spoken in probably 6 or 7 years until March this year at another cousin's wedding. However, we ended up sitting next to each other at the reception and hung out all evening and really hitting it off. Her fiance is great too.

I don't know. I feel like the mitigating factors are enough to choose the concert over the wedding but I also feel like an A for wanting to party with friends over attending a very important day in a family member's life.

WIBTA if I go to this concert?

P.S. I bought ticket insurance so I can get a full refund if I decide not to go so that doesn't factor into my decision.

My family member got a rental and was able to get home in that. The insurance company handled everything and that issue has been fixed.

Before the totaled car was towed, we removed all the after market parts that were not damaged. At the time, my family member thought that they might get the same model and put the parts on it. So I agreed to hold on to the parts until I could get them to him. He decided to get a different car with the insurance payout. He told me I could sell the parts and keep the money for my trouble. 

I sold all the parts very quickly on craigslist and facebook except for one. This happened to be a very large item and it was taking up space in my house. Nobody was interested in buying it. I got tired of it so I changed the listing to ""free"". A bunch of people contacted me, but most didn't have the right model for this part.

One guy did and said it was the right size and that he wanted it. That was all he said. I messaged him 4 times over the next 20 hours about logistics of him picking up the part. No response.

Well another guy contacted me and the part fit his car. He agreed to meet me at my preferred time. I sent another IM to the first guy and waited 20 min. No response. So I gave it to the second guy for free.

Several hours later, the first guy responded to my attempts to reach him and set up a time for him to come get the part. I told him someone else had already picked it up. He blew up and started cussing me out and that it was ""his free part"" and now he would have to ""buy one himself."" I told him I wanted it out of my house, ""that's why I giving it away for free.""

c5rln5	2019-06-26 16:02:07		AITA for cancelling us adopting a dog?	"My fiance (F) and I (M) recently found a young border collie puppy up for adoption. We live in the city.

I have been reading up on the breed, and learned they require a TON of open spaces, constant activity, work, and mental/physical stimulation. Last night I was in contact with the adoption agency and ended up putting a $200 deposit down for her, and scheduled the pick up to happen on 7/5.

I have even consulted with two close friends about their border collies and how they've adapted to living in suburban areas. They both stated that early years were difficult as the dog would get quite annoyed/pissy if it's physical needs weren't being met, and sometimes got destructive.

Our landlord stated she had to force a tenant to get rid of their dog because of the constant complaints from the other tenants. Not sure of the breed. This, along with the breeds mentality and our current living situation caused my fiance to have an anxiety attack last night.

After my fiance was calmed down, she urged me to reconsider this, and that she felt as if we were jumping to quickly into it and it would cause a lot of issues down the road. I was frustrated, but I completely get where she is coming from. I tried convincing her in the hour plus convo we had.  We went to bed watching the dogs herding videos and it didn't really help with the situation. It just caused her to go ""ugh I don't know"".  I even said just to give it some time, maybe you'll come around to it and realize it'll be fine. I am way more optimistic, where she is pessimistic.

Given that, fast forward to this morning. I called the adoption agency and told them we would have to retract on adopting her. My deposit is being returned. After telling my fiance this. She exploded into a frenzy of texts:

""I was coming around to it, its not fair to me""

""I will not let you make decisions for me""

""This is so unfair and you don't listen"" (just some of the barrage)

""You don't get to choose what WE do, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME""

I apologized of course, but I stated that I felt we communicated about this effectively and that she shouldn't be this upset towards me.  I did it considering her expressed concerns, and for the sake of the dog and our lifestyle.

TL;DR: Am I the asshole for cancelling on adopting a highly energetic border collie this morning without telling my fiance, even after we had a lengthy conversation about the risks last night?  I thought she was deadset on cancelling it."		1	0

c5rhph	2019-06-26 15:53:00	babygender2019	AITA for wanting to keep our baby’s a gender a surprise?	"My SO and I are expecting our first child, I’m five months along. This  will also be the first grandchild on both sides.
Since the beginning I have said that I wanted to keep the gender a surprise from everyone else once my husband and I find out. The first reason being that everyone I know who has revealed their baby’s gender early on ended up being given an excessive amount of useless gender specific baby outfits that are often not even worn before the baby outgrows them. The second reason is because I want to be the one who picks out my baby’s first clothes. 
I know my friends and family are planning baby showers and gifts and I would prefer to receive practical items and keep the infant formal wear to minimum, (especially because the baby will be born in November giving the grandparents plenty of time to shop cute stuff for Christmas.) My husband originally agreed to this plan and the reason behind it. 
However, both my mother and MIL have complained a lot about keeping the gender a secret. Their reasons are the same, they want to be able to shop for baby clothes and claim they can’t without knowing the gender. We have explained to both of them why we want to keep it a surprise, (my mother called me selfish but that’s a story for another sub).
Now If it were just limited to the mothers whining I could handle it, but now my husband has changed his mind. He is trying to convince me that we should just tell people the gender now that we know. He says that he doesn’t see why we are keeping “everything a secret.” 
AITA for wanting to stick to the plan and keep the gender a surprise?  Does anyone have a suggestion for a compromise?

Edit: I was trying to keep the post short so I didn’t want to write too much, but I am getting some comments about my reasoning. I’m also trying to establish boundaries with them. When we told the grandparents about the pregnancy both of our mothers started competing immediately. Calling dibs on first holidays and making plans as to who will take the kid to Disney world first. Forbidding use of certain names, and suggesting naming the kid after relatives. I understand that they’re excited but I don’t want to lose control of our experience as first time parents."

He is one of two people I share everything with. I have another friend, Gus, I have known for about 4 years and used to be really close with but not as much as I used to be. This is because he is pretty disloyal. About a year ago Gus started ditching plans that Will, him and I made. Then he would lie about being sick. He also would have parties and invite one or two guys other than us and invite a bunch of girls. Then he would claim that he thought we wouldn’t want to come. Another important thing to know is that was the one who brought Gus into our friend group. Before he didn’t have friends.

Okay, so in late May right after exams, he told me he wanted to hangout one day. I said I couldn’t because I was hanging out with my friend group. He was not originally invited because he had not hung out with us for a while but I invited him to come. About a day later, he sent a message that he was having a party and I checked the guest list and he invited everyone but my friend Will. After asking, he claimed it was because Will was a douche to him. (I never saw that happening but I do not know) Gus also claimed that Will did not invite him to parties but Will only did that when Gus would ditch us.

Nevertheless, Gus not inviting Will really hurt Will’s feelings. So, I ghosted Gus  entirely . A couple people said I was being too extreme because Gus never did anything to me.

Long story short, my wife and I and some friends are going to the west coast for four days to go camping, hike, and see some concerts. Our son will be a year old around that time and while we talked about being him, we (or I, as she likes to say) determined logistically it would be a nightmare. So he’s going to split time between the grandparents houses and my sister in law is also going to watch him for a bit too. While my wife is excited to go, she continually guilt trips me with “I can’t believe you’re so quick to want to leave him” and has even gone as far as to say that we’re being bad parents. We both throughly trust our parents, so I don’t see an issue with it.	Not the A-hole	0	0

I thought it was a cute gift and told her I appreciated it. However, given it was a compass (which I never really use in my life), I had stashed it away in my drawer. One of my friends this year got me an elephant keychain as a souvenir from her international trip and I have it on display on one of my bedroom cabinets. I am particular about what I put on display and thought the elephant was a nice addition. My girlfriend noticed this and got upset because I didn't put the compass on display. She asked me today why I would display the elephant but not the compass. I told her I didn't think the compass looked good on display (with my other things) and that I had no utility for it. Obviously, I wouldn't say that about a gift but I was specifically asked and this was from over 2 years ago so I figured I could be honest about it now (we are really open with each other).

However, I had some conflict with my parents when packing. 3 days before we left, they demanded I start to pack because they want to make sure that I have everything I need for the trip and if anything was missing we would have ample time to acquire the said item. I didn't feel like packing then, and wanted to pack the afternoon before, which I ended up doing at the disapproval of my parents. I feel like I am old enough to independently pack my clothes and that the self enforcing consequences of forgetting an item would be enough in terms of supervision, and that a full afternoon is plenty of time to buy anything I may need, especially since I can do it myself.

First time poster here... I live in Germany, but it's not really about the legal aspects, but maybe helps to place the mentality of people involved.

So I live in a big apartment complex with almost 90 flats and I was home when a delivery guy ringed and asked to accept 4 boxes for 4 different neighbors. This is the first time I did this, because usually I'm not at home during the day. I thought he has a hard job, so why not...
1 package was really big and heavy and I don't have the space in my flat. It's like an arcade in front of my flat door, 1 apartment behind mine, the house is  shaped like a U, so I'm almost at the end of the floor.
(sorry, english is only my second language, hope this is understandable as I describe it)
So 2 neighbors picked up their packages yesterday, today the one shows up that owns the huge package and asks me, why it is standing in front of my door. I told him, I'm sorry, it was heavy and I didn't have the space for it, so he goes on and and says it was my responsibility and if someone had stolen it, I would be liable. I'm insured for liability but I'm asking myself if I should have ringed on his door yesterday or something like that?
So, AITA for leaving it outside?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your feedback! Now I don't feel as bad anymore about his attitude, because I can just put him in the category ""douche""
It's sad that my consequence will be to be more careful in the future about which packages I will accept"	Not the A-hole	0	0

From being a pseudo mother to my siblings since I was 12 till now being an actual mom to my 2 kids (1 month and 3 yrs old). I never experienced living alone or even just having to take care of just myself.  

I've been thinking alot lately about taking a break when the kids get old enough to have their own lives and don't really need mothering anymore and just try experience living on my own or maybe just traveling on my own for a bit. They don't depend on me financial, I'm a SAHM. I do manage the household. But that role will  change once the kids are old enough to take care themselves and pick up after themselves.  My husband will just be stuck managing the bills and budget. But I can help with that remotely. I will also be supporting myself with the remote job I have. So I wont be taking any money from our joint account to support this excursion. 

I feel like a pos and selfish when I think about implementing this plan in the future.  But I also feel like it's something I need to experience to grow and change as a person, if that makes sense."	Not enough info	0	0
c5r805	2019-06-26 15:30:22		WIBTA for telling my bestie I'm a bit miffed about a cat video she sent me?	"AITA for talking to my bestie about an insensitive cat video? 

My love of my life Fatty Snigglemittens (15m, cat) has stopped eating and has lost a significant amount of weight. He's got pancreatitis but it hasn't gotten better after 5 weeks. He's gotten nausea shots and supplements and appetite stimulants and all sorts of stuff. Even though I'm tempting him with the smelliest canned food hes really only eating about 40% of what he'd usually scarf down. 

I had Fatty at the vet yesterday to get another checkup and next steps are an ultrasound and a good chance of an intestinal cancer diagnosis.

My bestie(30F)and I are cat ladies. I've been sharing with her my woes and while I was at the vet killing time waiting to pay I told her we were at the vet again because he's not eating and we fear the worst. Fatty used to be very food focused so him not eating is a big deal and she knows that. 

So... A half hour later she sends me a video of her cat (my godkitty) scarfing down a huge plate of food and purring really loudly, captioned ""omg the purring tho"" 

Like, great, you have a cat that's eating and loving it, way to rub it in my face? I didn't reply or message her again last night. 

It felt really insensitive and my husband even did the eyebrow thing when I showed him.

I'm flying back up to our hometown for a wedding tomorrow and I'm staying at her house, she's picking me up from the airport.  

She's a great friend but I definitely do a lot of the emotional labour in the relationship, because she's not good at feelings and all that crap but that's just the type of person I am, it comes naturally to me. But for instance my dad died suddenly in January and while she was there if I wanted to talk, she never really asked me about it or checked in on my feelings because that stuff makes her uncomfortable. Her side of the conversation was mostly a variety of frownie emojis. 

So. I'm sure she wasn't trying to be a dick and that could have been her clumsy way of trying to cheer me up, but am I justified in being a little miffed and telling her it hurt me a little bit, or am I just being extra sensitive because my cat is potentially dying?"	No A-holes here	1	0
c5r7yg	2019-06-26 15:30:14	potentialahole69	AITA For not supporting my (now ex) girlfriend's ambitions, ultimately leading to our breakup?	"We had dated for 2.5 years, started in college. She was an English major, with a minor in sports production. She had job offers in sports, but declined each one because it ""wasn't her dream"" even though she really liked it and was very talented at it.

&#x200B;

Instead, her ""dream"" was to be a Teen Fantasy book editor. She was so dead set on moving to New York or Boston, and living city life like they do in the movies.

&#x200B;

Of course, at first I said I supported her dreams, what girlfriend wouldn't say that? I didn't think she'd want to follow through with it as the year went on. But she never let go of that idea.

&#x200B;

As graduation approached I started to flat out say that I didn't like that idea. I told her that there were hardly jobs available in Editing/Publishing, and even if she did find one it likely wouldn't be editing teen fantasy novels. 

&#x200B;

She defended every argument I had, and it started to get escalated. I raised my voice and said that I'm not moving to Boston just for you to be a barista. That's when she lost it, and said I never loved her and blah blah.

&#x200B;

She packed up and left then and there. I started getting texts from her family saying If I truly loved her I'd be willing to move anywhere for her. 

&#x200B;

What about my dreams? I just wanted to settle down in the rocky mountains and raise a family?

c5r7x3	2019-06-26 15:30:08	Nrealy	AITA for telling my father how much more I spend on my mother?	"My parents divorced when I was 8. My father then proceeded to move two states over and had a new family. I still visited every summer because I had to but I always felt forgotten by my father.

I will always remember how they always planned their vacations when I wasn't there.

He also fought my mother at every turn to pay enough child support. As a result, my mother had to work doubly hard to make sure we had shelter and food.

I am now 30. I make a lot of money. Like a lot.

I have paid off my mother's home and I regularly send her on trips and gifts. She has a new boyfriend now who I really like. I see them once a month.

I live in the same state as my father now. They aren't doing that great financially. He invites me for dinner every few weeks. I usually cook something to take there.

Honestly, the only reason I go is to tell him all the things I do for my mother.

His wife sits there seething when she hears it. My father looks visibly hurt. Is it fucked up that I enjoy it?

You know how people say taking revenge is more damaging then it feels good? I don't know if I'm a psychopath or what but it honestly feels really great to me.

The reason I even bring this up is yesterday I was visiting my father yesterday and mentioned my gf, mom, her bf and I were going to Hawaii for a week. 

Hawaii was a place my father always wanted to go to. I know this.

He cried a little and apologized for not being a better father. I had a tiny twinge of guilt but honestly, it sounds like he regrets not betting on the right horse. My half-siblings have zero ambition.

I told him point blank that yes our relationship is not that great and it's his fault. I have chosen to help my mother because I'm the only child she has and he has two more that he can depend on for support.

My stepmother then had the nerve to call me selfish and I just laughed in her face.

c5r7c1	2019-06-26 15:28:37	eurydaaece	WIBTA if I demanded my mom have her grandma’s rings now?	"TLDR: I think my grandma might be hiding her mom’s wedding rings from my mom in order to sell them, and I want to ask her to either hand them over now or admit my mom can’t have them.

There’s some necessary backstory here that I’ll try to keep as brief as possible. Recently, my great-grandparents died. They were both in their 90s, but it’s still been a horrible, horrible shock for all of us. 

It’s now been a little over a month since my great-grandma’s funeral, and roughly two and a half weeks since my great-grandpa’s. There was a will, and their estate has been divided straight down the middle between their 2 children, my grandma & her sister. Basically, all their stuff is being sold at an estate sale, and my grandma & her sister are each gonna take half the money. However, they have told all of their children and grandchildren that we are allowed to take *any* sentimental thing we want, such as dishes or jewelry or guns, before the sale. 

My mom is as sweet and gentle as they come. She was very close to her grandma and has taken this very hard. The *only* thing she wants is one of her grandma’s wedding rings. Years ago, my mom was asked by my grandmother if there was anything of my great-grandma’s that she wanted, and she assured my mom then that she could have that ring. My grandma’s sister was there and agreed. 

My grandmother continues to assure my mom she can have it—however, she’s being sluggish. Her sister has already given her children and grandchildren the things they requested (some of which was jewelry), but my grandma continues to tell my mom those rings are “in the safe” and that she can’t have them yet. She’s vague when asked for a timeframe. None of my grandma’s half of the family (my mom and her siblings) have been allowed to take anything. My mom doesn’t want to push the issue because my grandmother just lost both her parents. But I know my grandma. She was a single mother for a long time, and even now that she’s married again and extremely well-off, she can’t help but hoard money. She’s already told my uncle he can’t have certain “big ticket” (her words, not mine) items because they won’t make any money at the estate sale without selling those items. (I know for a fact neither she or her sister need the money). I’ve already ruled out the idea anyone else wants the rings. I’ve asked. My grandma & her sis have said they’re ugly, so they don’t want them either. My mom has asked me not to bring it up because my grandma is grieving. 

So, with that, let me ask you: WIBTA if I stepped in and asked that my grandma either give my mom the ring or flat-out say she can’t have it?"	Asshole	0	0
c5r6k2	2019-06-26 15:26:52		AITA for being at my wits end with my coworker over use of the pause button during podcasts?	"There's moments when i'm so bothered by it, but on the other side i'm like ""wait she's trying to be nice... shut up u/neeeecola you brat ""

&#x200B;

I have a coworker (51F) who considers herself to be extremely smart. (She is very knowledgeable. She is a member to a lot of museums, self proclaimed science geek, space geek, nature geek, dino geek, history geek, truly it's amazing how much random subjects she knows about.) We listen to podcasts together- Radiolab, Frontline, Lore, behind the bastards, etc and she is in control of the speakers For the past year she pauses it all. the. time. I asked her to stop and she blantly just ignores my requests. Here's why she pauses it:

&#x200B;

1.  Whenever I step away from my desk, even when still within ear shot, she pauses it. I've even stood up to adjust my chair and she had it paused as soon as chair was pushed back! I politely told her something along the lines of ""While I appreciate you making sure I don't miss anything you don't have to pause it when I get up, most of the time I'm still able to hear what's being said. I'll ask you to pause it if needed"" and she nodded and understood. that was a month ago. **ALSO TO ADD: SHE NEVER EVER PAUSES IT WHEN SHE HERSELF WALKS AWAY.** She will go to a different floor and leave it running, but if i step a foot away she pauses it.

&#x200B;

2. An other big pause-cause is she can add her own commentary. Either to give me a brief lesson about something they mentioned that SHE thinks they did not talk enough about, to correct their pronunciation, to make a joke about what they said, or referencing something else very obscure that's somewhat related to the podcast. She always is referencing something that NO ONE besides her knows about and she will then give a lesson about the reference that only she knew. She always gets more excited when people say they never heard of it. (I've now just gotten silent during these pauses so I'm not encouraging a LONGER pause.

&#x200B;

In the last hour she paused the podcast 12 times.. I was never 4 feet away from the speakers. She corrected 5 mispronounced last names, and 1 city. And other than they she just paused so much just to make her own comments about whatever they said. I've asked her politely to not pause it so much as I really like to listen to the podcast without breaks, and she always says okay but a year later and nothing's changed.

Help me settle my internal debate. Am I being nuts here and need to chill out?

&#x200B;

TLDR: While working, self described intellectual Coworker(51F) and I(25F) listen to podcasts and she pauses it all the time. She pauses the podcasts whenever I step away from my desk EVEN while still in earshot, even though i asked her not too. (she never pauses if SHE leaves though) and she pauses the podcasts we listen to in order to give her own commentary. I politely asked her to not do this as well. and She still has the pause frenzy."		1	0
c5r5kz	2019-06-26 15:24:43	not_cinderella	AITA for getting mad when my brother eats my food but not my parents?	"I'm a 20 year old F living with my parents while I work part-time and go to school. My brother (30) who works full-time moved back in a little over a year ago.

&#x200B;

I'm a vegetarian and have different food preferences from my parents, so I do all my own cooking. My mom tries a lot of what I make though and my dad tries some as well. I also bake a lot, for my parents and myself - they really like to have muffins and scones for breakfast so I will usually bake a batch once a week. My parents probably buy around \~50% of my food/ingredients for recipes for me and I buy the other 50%. I usually label anything I need for recipes so it's not gone by the time I use it. Sometimes my parents will use that stuff anyways and then replace it by the time I need it. I also label food I buy for myself like ingredients or snacks like chips, cookies, etc. Sometimes my parents will eat this stuff and IDK it doesn't really bother me, but when my brother does, it drives me insane. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday, there was an empty bag of chips with my initial on them on the counter. I picked them up and asked ""Who ate these?"" and my mom said she did and I was just like ahh okay and threw the empty bag out. My brother got kind of defensive and asked why I wasn't mad mom ate my chips and labeled when I would have been pissed if he'd eaten them (he's eaten my stuff in the past before and I've gotten mad - it's the reason I label things) and I didn't really have an answer.

&#x200B;

Honestly the reason I get mad if my brother eats my stuff is he never buys his own food except beer and takeout. He'll go through entire bags of chips or make quesadillas with ingredients I needed in the middle of the night and never replace anything. Whereas my parents and I kind of have a more reciprocal relationship. Sure they eat some food I buy sometimes, but they also buy me a lot of food and I appreciate the support they give me while I live at home going through school. I cook and bake sometimes for them to show that appreciation. I just don't feel angry when they eat my food because of all they give me I don't see it as a big deal. My brother and I don't NOT get along, but we're mostly just civil with each other. I'm mad-ish he moved back home because of the disruption it caused in the household and the fact he doesn't pay rent or contribute to the house very much. When he eats my food, I'm angry because I see it as him just being too lazy to buy his own food and not caring that he may be inconveniencing me or someone else. My dad literally has to hide his beer and alcohol in MY closet when my parents go on vacation because otherwise my brother will drink it. It just feels a bit unfair to me I guess.

c5r5jx	2019-06-26 15:24:40	InTheHague	AITA? Breaking contact with my dad	"Hello people of reddit. 

My dad left my mom for another woman (her best friend and colleague) and we didn't see him for 2 years. (his new girl didn't want anything to do with his ""other"" kids.) My dad has always had an anger issue, and would take it out on me. 

Fast forward many years and I sorta have a relationship with my dad again. But it's a mostly relationship that's based on me giving, him taking. He never comes to visit us, but we need to visit him. He only calls when he needs me to do something etc. He's now remarried and has 2 stepsons (same age as me and my sister, so adults now). It's pretty obvious to me and my sister that he prefers the boys. He takes them on holidays and outings, even invites their friends, but not inviting us. When it's Christmas or their birthday, they get these extravagant gifts, while my sister and I need to make do with a potted plant. All of this is highly annoying but, I can deal with that.

My boys adore my dad, because he has cool cars, and he really can be an awesome guy. 

A while ago though, my dad got a new dog. A very pretty Golden Retriever. Something, however, is VERY wrong with this dog. She attacks my boys and my sisters daughters without any reason. They'd just be sitting at a table coloring, and this dog will suddenly lunge at them. My dad insists it's just ""play"". But as somebody who's worked with dogs my entire life, I can tell you, that it's not play. My kids love all dogs, and are never afraid of them, but this hellhound has got them scared. And honestly, me too.

I had a serious discussion with my dad and he said I shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

On the last party however, my son (6) walked in front of me when suddenly, the dog aggressively barks, runs up to my kid (from behind me), lunges at him with such force, it send my kid flying. Like he did a literal somersault and landed face down on the ground. It shocked me so bad I kicked the dog off my kid, picked him up and left.

A week later, I send my dad a text, explaining how I've had it. That everything that had happened in my life, everything that frustrates me about our relationship, has come to a boiling point. I want him to either get rid of the dog or I don't ever want to hear or see him again.

He chose the latter. He then contacted my husband in a text saying ""OP is no longer welcome at our house,because she said such mean things! But for you and the kids our door is always open."" This pissed me off so much, that he would go around my back, that I went off at him. I spewed all my frustration and anger into a very long text to them. Never heard from them since. And honestly, I'm relieved.

But maybe it's my self doubt, but I still feel like I did wrong here. So reddit, AITA? Did I do this wrong? Should I have just swallowed it and go on?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Edit: After reading your responses I've decided calling ICE isn't the way to go. I'm going to file a noise complaint and if that doesn't do anything I will call the police the next time she starts screaming.

"My mom thinks, in no particular order, someone shes pissed off: had their grandpa buy the house next to her to spy on her, uses her phones, TV ect to spy on her. Put malware on her phone, paid someone to stab her to death, broke into the house without stealing or breaking anything with a gun, messed with the breaks (on her super old car). 

I humored her. Looked into her phone, drove her around to get things looked at, listened to her. 

My mom can definitely drive someone to want to kill her, Ive personally considered stabbing her a time or two growing up (heat of the moment).

I humored her and when none of it panned out I kindly suggested maybe she might need a visit to a therapist or the hospital. That didnt go over well. 

I've since moved on to telling her to see someone or dont talk to me anymore.


Info: I didnt call her crazy at first, if at all, honestly she says I did but O dont remember using that specific word. I kindly suggested maybe it WAS ""all in her head"" after she brought it up herself. She quickly changed her mind and became agitated and rude.

INFO: I've never actively plotted to kill my mom. It was only on days her mental abuse went too far. She abuses drugs and alcohol as well as wasnt the best of moms. 

(The one time in particular I remember I considered stabbing her was while I was cleaning the dishes she woke me up in the middle of the night to wash because she claimed I didnt do them before bed. I showed her a picture of the empty sink I had taken before bed. She said she didnt care and I needed to do the dishes the picture could be fake and she went on to berate me calling me a manipulative bitch. )"	No A-holes here	0	0

Little bit of background this has been an absolute shit show. Professor in charge took class out to a bar and mentioned it to me then and I showed interest because it sounded cool. As it continued I started some forms and figured some things out applied for a couple of scholarships assuming I could bail at anytime. 

They want us to leave now and had me get all of these forms super last minute because I wasn’t copied on an email and missed all this info. Had to do everything while on vacation and kept getting angry phone calls demanding information about myself and health history and all of these tests that I filled out because when I said “I’ll just go later” this professor absolutely blew.

c5r2sw	2019-06-26 15:17:55	Woodygal82	AITA for wanting consistency?	I will try to make this as concise as possible. My boyfriend, who I love with, gets mad at me and tells me I am just looking for a reason to get mad when I get frustrated because every morning he will text with his friends before speaking to me. If I say good morning or try to talk he may mumble something back. According to him he doesn’t feel like talking first thing in the morning and “talking and texting are two different things.” I have told him that him speaking to me in the morning is important to me but he thinks I am just being silly. Overall our relationship is okay but he is pretty moody. He spends A LOT of time on Instagram (especially looking at the butt pages) and he talks to his ex-girlfriend frequently and she doesn’t know I exist. AITA for wanting consistency?

c5r1pa	2019-06-26 15:15:33	attemptednotknown	AITA for not agreeing to officiate at my Uncle’s wedding?	"My uncle is getting married for the third time next month. He called me the other day out of the blue and asked if I would officiate the ceremony for him. I was his best man at his second wedding, and he said that, because I was such a funny guy and that I gave a good speech for him fifteen years ago, I should be the one to marry him again. I politely told him that I was flattered that he would think of me, but three weeks isn’t enough time for me to prepare and get mentally ready for such an event, as I’m not a huge fan of public speaking to begin with. It’s also important to note that his wedding is in the middle of an already paid for vacation with my kids. The wedding venue is not far from the campground were staying at so I have no problem going, but don’t want to be stressing out about my role in a wedding for half of my time off.

&#x200B;

I immediately started receiving phone calls from my whole family telling me I was being inconsiderate and selfish, especially when I had agreed to officiate for my friend’s wedding next year. Again, my friend gave me a year to get ready when my uncle is giving me three weeks in the middle of my vacation.

She said that her commissions were open and asked what I wanted. I sent her reference pictures and described what I wanted. And after that... nothing she never replied to me, acknowledged me or said anything. 

A month later I asked if she was still doing commissions. nothing. That was back in early AprilI guessed that she didn't want to do it now because her bio now said that her commissions were closed. Imagine my surprise when I wake up this morning to her saying that she finished the art and was awaiting her payment. 

The thing is, I'm just a broke highschool student. I kept the money that I was gonna pay her with aside, but after months of her not saying anything, I decided to spend it. She's now saying that I was robbing her and was trying to get free art from her. So, am I the asshole?

c5qyom	2019-06-26 15:08:33	DecayPlaceMinute3	AITA for lying about my upbringing in college?	"So the background is I was brought up Catholic but REALLY disliked it. My father's side of the family is Lutheran so I got a lot of exposure to that growing up too and preferred it since I have serious issues with the Catholic positions on sexuality. Once I graduated high school I told my Mom I wasn't ever going to Mass again, which she accepted, she encouraged me to attend a non-Catholic church in college but I didn't until I was out of college. She also agreed to not ask me to attend Mass when visiting home, so we went to the Lutheran church close to us instead when i was visiting, including on Christmas.

When I was in college I didn't want to be seen as Catholic AT ALL but also wasn't attending another church or had formally converted. I wanted a complete 100% clean break, I didn't want to be associated with being Catholic in ANY way. I had a few friends though that were more religious and went to some campus Christian groups, when we talked about that I basically said that I wasn't going to such things now, but didn't want to say I was raised Catholic for that reason. So I just said I was raised Lutheran but wasn't practicing.

Once I told my mom about this she got upset. She said that it was fine I didn't want to be Catholic but she was proud of her background and claimed I was erasing that and denying my heritage. She also thought I was disrespecting the Lutheran church somewhat since I had never been a formal member even if familiar and close to it. She advised to just say I was brought up Catholic but consider myself more Lutheran now. I didn't want to because I thought it was too complex and it implied that I had formally converted to the Lutheran church (which I hadn't) or that I was regularly attending services there (I wasn't.) Plus I couldn't stand people who thought that just made me a ""non-practicing Catholic"" instead of a non-Catholic and wanted to avoid that. My mom's response was that not everyone who goes to a different church than what they were raised in goes through the trouble of formally converting and joining and though I wasn't regularly attending in college, I was going with my family enough while at home. She basically didn't want me to deny the Catholic part of the family, and found it hurtful to her. I simply didn't want any ambiguity, any association with Catholicism, or any implication I was a ""non-practicing Catholic"". I viewed it as akin to someone who had been a drug addict but had successfully completed rehab and no longer had those issues. They're not obligated to share with people that that was in their past.

c5qw7g	2019-06-26 15:03:17		WIBTA if I ask the server to split the check for online daters whose profiles or photos are way out of date?	"One of the evils of online dating is that people sometimes post profile information or photos that are not accurate.  People who mark ""single"" are sometimes ""working on getting a divorce"" or ""we have an understanding,"" or have some other excuse for misrepresenting their current marital status:  MARRIED.  


Some use profile photos from many years or many pounds ago.  As someone who takes great pains to provide current information and photos (I used a professional photographer for my profile), I am upset when others misrepresent themselves.  I find it dishonest, and it robs me of the opportunity to make my decision based on current information.  I didn't ask the 2005 version of these people out, I ask the 2019 version.  It makes me wonder what other lies or out-of-date information is in the profile.  


If the person lets it drop during that first date that she is in fact married but misrepresented her status as single, I feel that the date was obtained under false pretenses.  I don't knowingly agree to dates with married women.    


If the person shows up and the photos are significantly out of date, I feel that the date was obtained under false pretenses.  Photos are posted so prospective suitors have an idea whether they'd be attracted to the person.  With everyone pretty much having a smartphone with a high-powered camera on it, there's no excuse for using photos from George W. Bush's first term.  I can understand not having photos taken that week, but it's delusional when it's from several presidencies ago.  


I feel a social duty to stay and at least converse with these people, but it pretty much stops being a date the moment dishonesty is discovered.  For the married who claimed to be single, I'd like to tell the server on the spot ""this will be separate checks"" upon discovering it.  For the out-of-date photo people, I'd like to call for separate checks as soon as the server comes to the table.  The guy usually ends up with the social expectation of paying during a date, but I think I'm absolved of that if there is material deception.  Calling them out on the deception seems like a way to start a bad scene in a public place, but I don't want to buy them a meal or see them again at that point.

c5qvh6	2019-06-26 15:01:47		AITA for letting my boyfriend buy me a tattoo	"Posting this on anon! 

I recently got a tattoo from a flash sale. The artist told me he was planning on releasing more tattoo designs for the same price next week. I told him I wouldn’t be able to afford one next week.

My boyfriend and I left and he told me he could pay for one as an early birthday present if I’d like (my birthday is 2 months away). The tattoo was $160 AUD. I asked him if he was being serious and he said yes, so after making sure he could afford it I accepted. I was so happy and excited, i couldn’t stop thanking him and I made the booking as soon as I could and was happy as I could be. 

Fast forward to tonight, he got home from work and was acting cold towards me. I asked him what was wrong and he said “I paid for your tattoo and I feel like nothing has even changed”.

I got extremely upset and asked him what he meant, and he said he feels like I’m not acting grateful towards him in any way. He said he was “broke” but still paid for it and I didn’t show any appreciation. 

I was really confused because he kept reassuring me that he could 100% afford this, and this whole time I’ve been excited about it and kept thanking him over and over again. I was also a little but annoyed because he said that it was an early birthday present, and yet it sounded like he was expecting something in return.

I earn way less than him, which means he usually pays for most of our dinners and whatnot. So I always clean the house, do the washing, cook dinner for him, heck I even dust his figures for him. I basically do all the house chores and try whatever he wants in bed (felt the need to add that, sorry) to show my appreciation towards him for taking great care of me. 

So I genuinely didn’t know what more I could have done to show my appreciation for the tattoo? Because I already do pretty much everything I can for him and treat him the best I can.

I explained all of this to him and I guess he realised  how upset I was and apologised saying he shouldn’t expect anything in return for a gift. 

But now I’m overthinking and worried I did do something wrong, and I’m feeling guilty and feel like I don’t want the tattoo anymore. AITA?"		1	0

"My wife and I have a three week old newborn, and we have a one bedroom apartment. We have already been struggling trying to adjust to parenthood and getting a flow. My wife’s sister is pregnant and is due in a month. She lives in a different state, and is living with their mother. I’m not 100% sure of the details right now, but she does not want to stay with her and does not want to stay with her babies’ daddy. She says we are her last option, and she will be up and out in about a month. I’m not sure if that’s the case, as she doesn’t have a job lined up, or a place to live. I just don’t want this kind of strain on our marriage right now. We both are looking for new jobs as well, as our contract ends in a month, so it’s also terrible timing. I love to help people, but space and stress is a huge issue right now.  She just came up with this plan overnight, as she failed to plan for anything else. WIBTA?

c5qu8f	2019-06-26 14:58:57	SuperCub	AITA for ending a long-term friendship?	"A year ago, I got out of a hostile domestic situation. My ex-friend and ex-housemate Bert (I rented a room in his house) mistreated me, attempted to gaslight me, and created a hostile situation. I moved out, finding a fantastic new place with some other friends. There has been no contact with Bert since.

A couple that used to be very close to all of us, John & Craig, immediately took Bert’s side in the dispute. Even though we had a close-knit friend circle, they decided to purposely exclude me in group events that Bert was included in.

John, at one point, had a birthday party that I had been invited to for the previous 7 years. I was told about the upcoming party from mutual friends. Craig (not John) contacted me to say that I was specifically not allowed to attend.

Afterwards, they apologized and told me how they wished it were different. They said Bert would throw a fit if I was invited and they didn’t want to deal with his tantrums.

This is a good time to mention that Bert got Craig his high-paying job at a large tech company.

After 8 years of being besties with John and Craig, and because Bert didn’t want me at John’s birthday, these close friends of mine excluded me from the event.

That was last year (2018). Since then, I have tried my best to maintain a friendship with John & Craig. They are people I truly care about and have many fond memories with.

Over the last year, I’ve found out that they’ve done many group events with all of our friends that I wasn’t included in. I’ve given them the benefit of the doubt that, if they had controlled the guest list, they would have invited me.

At New Year’s, and again a month later, Craig and I had conversations about this and he promised that I would be invited to everything from here on out. He felt bad about being put in a position where one person was pressuring him to exclude another and said he wouldn’t do that again, that I would be included.

Now a year has passed in which I’ve been trying to stay on good terms with them, but anytime Bert was around, they wouldn’t want anything to do with me.
John had his 2019 birthday party this last weekend. I texted Craig to ask what was going on and why I wasn’t included and he replied that it was a small venue and, since Bert was included, there wasn’t a thing they could do and they were sorry.

I was devastated. At this point, it might be appropriate to go back and say how devastated I was when this happened a year ago. These were some of my closest and most trusted friends, whom I cared about more than most people, so I wanted to give them another chance, again.

I came to realize that John & Craig were allowing Bert to dictate who they are friends with and to hurt me through them. Bert knew how important they were to me.

Because of that, I decided to end my friendship with John & Craig so that this couldn’t happen again. Now John has made a scathing FB post painting me as a monster, publicly, to everyone we know. Tell me, Reddit, AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5qtpx	2019-06-26 14:57:39	zodiacgal	WIBTA for telling a sublet currently living with me to stop having sex in the house?	"Pretty much what the post title says. This girl is subletting my housemates room and me and my other housemate have heard her have sex almost every day and night. It even WOKE ME UP the other morning because it was so loud! And it’s not just small noises either, it sounds like they’re filming a full on porno in her room. Her moaning (screaming) is so loud you can hear it from across the house or even downstairs.

She’s also only been here a week, and is meant to be staying another 3. It’s really bothering me and my other housemate. The first time I heard it I kind of blew it off as a one-off thing, but now it’s making me so angry I want to tell her to shut up and have some respect, but in the nicest way possible? But does this make me an asshole, cos I guess she’s paid the rent to stay here for a month? 

She was being so loud before I purposefully left my room and stomped down the hallway, turning all the lights on so they knew I was awake, and she didn’t stop at all. If anything she was even louder. Aaaaah!

c5qrex	2019-06-26 14:52:09	AnonAholeThrowaway	AITA for trying to use public shaming to try and change behavior?	"My local train station is under construction, so thy have half of the inbound platform closed off. Big, six-foot-tall signs saying ""this platform will be closed from such-and-such date through so-and-so date. Please use west platform. Violators will be prosecuted."" (police have been on hand a couple of times to ticket people) They put these signs up about a month before the closing date, so people had plenty of time to learn to arrive two minutes earlier if they need to.

&#x200B;

The problem is, they can't put the barricades and the fence right up to the edge of platform, because the train might hit it. So there's \~2 feet of space at the very edge of platform which is still passable. A space which people still use to squeeze through from the closed end of the platform, \*\*even as trains are arriving\*\*.

&#x200B;

So I've taken to pulling out my phone and taking a photo of them next to the sign, in hopes that they'll feel shamed into stopping. Most of the people have stopped doing it. And just to clear something up, I'm not trying to be a busybody, I just know that one of these days, one of these idiots is going to slip or trip and fall onto the tracks, and cause my train to get massively delayed.

&#x200B;

Anyway, today, a repeat offender walks by and says ""stop videoing me or I'm gonna beat your ass."" I pointed out that I was simply taking a photo of the sign saying that the platform was closed. We went back and forth a bit, but he maintained his position that if I kept going it, he was going to beat me up.

c5qqhc	2019-06-26 14:49:59	shiba_inuuu	WIBTA if I turned up to a friends BBQ with nothing	"I’m attending a BBQ on Friday. My friend is hosting it at her house and said she will provide the basics but could we bring things like burgers, sausages and chicken.

It’s obvious that she would like us to provide the main food. No problem, maybe she’s low on money and it’ll be a fun evening regardless.

The issue is that 3 people attending have been rude in the past at gatherings.  Let’s call them A, B and C. The first time we scheduled to have a party and sleepover at another friends house. A kept saying how boring it was at said party, and then went around asking people to go out clubbing with her. It’s important to note that this was a small party (around 8 of us) and we are all close friends, so we all thought it was rude to try and get others to go out with her, especially since some people at the party weren’t even old enough to go clubbing at the time. In the end A, B and C left to go clubbing, asking us to let them in around 2am so they could sleep over.

We are all friends so we decided to brush this one time off. However the next time this happened it was worse.

Around 6 months ago, I was organising a small party at my house.  I decided to pay for all the alcohol & food since I have a job and most of the others are students. The same friends attended, and for an hour or so we were having a good time. Once again, A goes on about how we are boring and she wants to go clubbing.

What annoyed me about this time was that A, B and C seemed to have already discussed leaving to go clubbing before arriving, they brought outfits with them. They then drank lots of my alcohol, and then said they were leaving. They had my drinks so they wouldn’t have to buy drinks at the club. At this point a few people had to go home so they had left, and A, B and C went out clubbing, leaving me and a friend left.

They then asked me for my house key to get back in later. I said I’m not giving them my key in case they lose it. They then said I need to stay up until 3am to let them in so they could sleep at mine, and shouted at me when I said no, I wanted to sleep. A, B & C also live a 3 minute drive from my house, I don’t know why they wouldn’t just go back to theirs after.

I wanted to not let them in since I was annoyed, but me and the friend left were having a good time playing wii games in my front room so we happened to be awake. A, B & C then arrive banging on my window and screaming. I opened the door and asked them to be quiet, my family were asleep. That was totally ignored, they were very loud and drunk. This woke up my entire family and my dog.

Turns out C’s boyfriend had driven them there and back. Once again, I don’t understand why they couldn’t have gone back to their houses.

So back to the main question, the BBQ is at C’s house. Attending will be A, B, C, another friend and me. She expects us all to bring food. But I am annoyed and feel that I owe them nothing because of the above.

c5qqdx	2019-06-26 14:49:47	chronbutt	AITA for not letting my step-cousin move into my apartment?	"A few days ago my mom told me that my step-cousin had some issue with her lease and that she would need a place to stay for roughly 6 weeks. I am at home about two hours away from my apartment for the summer and wont be moving back into my apartment until the end of August. My mom told my cousin that she could use my room while I'm not there and I told her I was very uncomfortable with it. Now I don't pay rent. My mom splits the rent payment between my dad, my girlfriends parents (my girlfriend lives with me when we're at school), and herself. Without talking to my dad, my girlfriends parents, or myself, she volunteered my apartment.


Since my girlfriend and I moved out for the summer we only brought back the stuff we need for the summer (summer clothes, work clothes, TV, etc.) and left everything else we own at our apartment. Our dressers and closets are still full of winter clothes, jackets, other clothing items, school books, and other very personal items. There is no room for someone else to come in without them having to go through all of our stuff and somehow find a way to make room for their clothes. And I'm very uncomfortable with someone going through our stuff. I'm also uncomfortable with someone sleeping in our bed for such an extended period of time. We bought that mattress when we moved in and knowing that we're the only two that have slept in that bed is kind of special to me. (I know that probably sounds really weird, but that's how I feel). I wont even sleep in that bed if she isn't there, I slept on the couch the one day that my girlfriend wasn't at the apartment with me.


She is my step-cousin and I've known her most of my life but we have never really been super close. We have only started getting closer this past year but we hardly ever talk. Shes a great person and I really like talking to her but I just feel uncomfortable with her staying at my girlfriend and my place. We built a home there and it would feel weird for someone else to be living in it without us there for 6 weeks. She has offered to pay $300 but rent is $550 a month. Money isn't really the issue and if everything else didn't bother me I wouldn't even ask for any money. We also have a roommate who has a cat and we're very strict about his cat being in our room (he's peed on our bed a few times when we first moved in so he's not allowed to be in our room anymore). I'm worried she'll forget to close the door and the cat will pee on our bed again. She also has two pet rats which kind of tops it all off I guess. I feel really shitty for telling her no, so I figured I would see how Reddit feels about this situation. Do you guys think I'm an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5qnju	2019-06-26 14:42:56		AITA for turning on the shower 15 minutes before I actually shower so that no one can steal the bathroom?	"I live in a boarding house basically- my landlord lives in a room and rents out the other bedrooms to tenants for a ridiculous amount of money per month. Still beats the prices for a 1 bedroom in this area, so I deal with it.

Lately though, my landlord has been inviting relatives to come stay in the guest room- normally 3-4 at a time. We already have 3 women sharing our bathroom, so when his guests come that’s 3 extra people to share our bathroom with. There’s another bathroom upstairs, but his guests only seem to want to use ours.

His guests are on vacation, so they take as long as they please getting ready, hanging out, etc. I work two jobs and am out of the house from 10am-midnight for the whole summer.

Because I’m so busy, all I want is 30-45 mins in the morning to shower and get ready in peace. But being that so many people use our bathroom now, that’s nearly impossible.

So normally I’ll get up 15 minutes before I intend to use the bathroom and go put the shower on so that no one gets in there while I’m getting ready to get in. Today annoying relative #1 banged on the door 4 separate times while I was showering.

c5qmea	2019-06-26 14:40:18		WIBTA for contacting the employer of a person who hit my car and refuses to take responsibility for it	"Two weeks ago while we were both participating in a multi-organizational state exercise, they backed into my parked vehicle. At the scene it was evident they didn't feel they were responsible, attempting to shift blame onto my vehicles age and some what rusted front. Assuming they was just nervous and giving them the benefit of the doubt, as we both work in positions of trust with the state, I wrote it off. We exchanged contact info however and I was ghosted promptly after asking her to cover my vehicle's damages (this is of course after they reassured me they would do anything needed to help with the situation). I live in a no fault state so going through my insurance provider is impractical due to the deductible cost outweighing the repairs themselves.

Would it be overkill to inform their employer of this thing? I really don't want to get her fired but at the same time someone in a position of trust being unwilling to take accountability for something they very clearly did (by their admission and easily 5 witnesses, all also of positions of trust) shouldn't not face the repercussions of their actions.

The moral hangup is over whether or not this is all even worth it, I've certainly done shitty things before but never to the point of costing someone else a paycheck. They also lied to me and lack the sense of morality expected of their position."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5qlv8	2019-06-26 14:38:58	Lessthanewis	AITA If I give away my siblings books	"My mom asked if I could move back home to help at my parents house. Her health is getting worse and my dad isn't there a lot because of work. She is on oxygen 24/7 and finds it hard to take care of most things. My husband and I also have a baby so there is 3 people moving in. There is 2 spare bedrooms and we are taking both.

 One of them used to be my siblings room and had left some things behind when they moves out. That sibling hasn't been in contact with us because she has feelings that are unrelated to this story so I won't put in the time now. They had been asked more than a week ago by text if they wanted to come get the rest of the stuff. Mostly it was more than 100 books in the closet. There was no response. We told them that of they don't respond we are going to take it as they don't want it anymore. To note, it is the same phone number, positive. 

The past 2 weeks I have been going there and getting everything organized for things to be moved in. Last night I went and did that room. I started with the books and just put them in my car. My mom does not want the book. She said we gave them enough time to respond. I said well that's it. My mom also said that my dad wants to look through the books. I said no, they aren't his, he doesn't need them. Mind you, my dad keeps almost everything. He has an attatched garage and a detatched garage where it is filled with random junk. Filled. She said he wanted to put them in the attic. I said they would not be touched again, no way. 

In the meantime the books are being put in my mother in laws basement to where she might have a garage sale next year. I told my mom if the sibling doesn't contact us by then, (we aren't going out of our way to say we removed them) then they will be sold next year. But in the meantime they are out of the way.

c5ql5r	2019-06-26 14:37:18		WIBTA if I tell my friend that I can't help out her ex-boyfriend?	"A friend of mine from years ago came back into my life recently. We both have daughter's the same age, and we both left our boyfriend's around the same time. 

Now the problem is that she is currently living with her parents and her ex boyfriend (father of her daughter, I'll call him T) is not allowed at their home. T has a current girlfriend who is apparently batshit crazy.  She assaults him, ruins his stuff, throws his stuff around and at him, and doesn't allow him to have his children over. 

Basically my friend calls me all the time to ask if her and T can come over because T's girlfriend has gone crazy yet again. Although I don't mind them coming over, since their daughter is also daughter's friend, it's becoming a nuisance to have to accomodate them as I am a single mother and can't afford to feed them all day long., and also because I can't even put my baby for a nap because I feel like I always have to be there entertaining them.

The main reason I'm going to message her and tell her no more is because yesterday T just showed up at my house, without my friend, without any notice or anything. He said that my friend told me to go to my place. I've told her before that she needs to give me notice when she or him plans on coming over, as I have a baby and cannot always answer the door. Instead she told him to come here without so much as a message asking or any warning. 

On top of that T is unwilling to call the police on his girlfriend, which to me has only proven that he doesn't care about his children. On top of that it is also putting me and my children at risk if these crazy woman decides to come to my home. 

Now the only reason I am asking if I WBTA is because I know that people in abusive relationships have a harder time just calling the police, or making those hard decisions that need to be made. I know also because he is a man that he probably feels ashamed. He doesn't have any friends, or anyone to turn to other than my friend, who doesn't have anyone to turn to except me. I just feel like I'm too busy with my own drama (two kids, two baby daddies, bucket loads of my own problems, college) to be dealing with their constant issues.

c5ql00	2019-06-26 14:36:56	throeawaylolol	AITA for not wanting to be friends after a date?	"Gonna make this pretty short and simple. Met a girl at an anime con, later went on a date. I absolutely did not feel anything, we even had way different personalities. After the date I told her I wasn't feeling anything and I hope she finds someone and she was appreciative of the honesty and we haven't talked since.


I genuinely felt bad, she was a super nice girl but we just didn't have that much in common (besides cosplay). I sent her a message 2 months later saying that I felt bad we didn't work out, she replied that it was okay but she still wanted to be friends since she liked hanging out. I replied ""Sorry but no thanks, I just rather move on"" because I didn't even have a desire to hang out with her as friends (again, way different personalities).


AITA?

Edit: guys I didn't message her saying I didn't want to be friends. I messaged her telling her sorry we didn't work out, she replied back asking me to be friends, I replied back that I didn't want to be.

Final edit: Okay I can see how messaging her again after a period of no contacts could come across as wanting to be friends, definitely a miscommunication on my part."	Asshole	0	0
c5qku3	2019-06-26 14:36:33	AintAboutTheMula	AITA if I un-invite someone on an overseas holiday with me and my friends?	"That someone is a work colleague, and we don't really extend the friendship outside of the boundaries of work. We somehow got onto the topic that it would be a good idea if we traveled together, only I was also planning a trip overseas with my friends at the same time. It was one of those things said that you never expect to eventuate, but this time it did. The worst part is, that I was unable to say no, and this person has booked their travel (but nothing else).

I have recently consoled in my other 3 friends whom I have been close with for years now, and they aren't very happy about the situation. They feel awkward that someone who they have never met, and don't know anything about is just going to crash our trip - and we would need to spend 5 weeks together. As I've got to know this person more over the course of this whole thing unfolding, the more I feel uneasy and literally sick to the stomach that this is a bad idea. We are very different people, with different travel expectations, and different ways of going about things in generally. I am quite easy going, laid back and like to go with the flow, and my friends are the same. This person is pretty much the direct opposite. Not only that, but I now feel like I am burdening my friends with this.

I know it's my own fault that I didn't stop this in its tracks much earlier but this is where I am now and I have to deal with it.

So, AITA if I tell this person the truth and un-invite them on the trip? I feel absolutely HORRIBLE and the only reason why I haven't already is because I feel very empathetic and can't stop thinking how bad they'd feel when hearing this news. I was also thinking of offering to cover expenses on their behalf as a way to apologise. On one hand, I know if I don't do this I would feel very uneasy about the trip leading up to it, and it would potentially ruin the trip for myself and my close friends but on the other hand if I do this, this will probably create a very hostile future relationship with this person in the workplace (don't directly work with this person however).

TL;DR - AITA if I tell a work colleague that myself and my friends feel uncomfortable with having someone none of us really know that well come along on this trip and that they would no longer be invited?

c5qju8	2019-06-26 14:34:02	halfbakedlikeacake	UPDATE: AITA for refusing to give my newborn’s social security number to my aunt.	"[Link to a snapshot of my OP](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bwoxwx/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_newborns_social/epz1kn2/)

I was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. My aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. I explained why exactly I didn’t feel good about giving her Leyla’s social security number. They both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn’t see anything wrong with it.

After explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn’t have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. We ended up working out a compromise - My wife and I opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. Everything seemed to have worked out well.

Yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from Romania. She had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. She said it completely justified my hesitation. Her information was stolen in the Equifax breach a couple of years ago.

Moral of the story: Trust your gut on financial matters. While my mom and aunt had good intentions in mind, you really can’t be too careful these days."	Update	0	0
c5qjmw	2019-06-26 14:33:33	fingergunmcgee04	WIBTA if I ask my grandfather to take his dog with him whenever he goes places from now on?	I know some places don't allow dogs so if he stayed home with me in those cases that's okay but Id prefer if he'd take his dog with him whenever he goes if he can. I love the dog himself. He's a really old bichon frise, 13 years old to be exact so I pretty much grew up with him. The problem is the dog just doesn't stop barking or whining more specifically towards me. Any time I look in his general direction he'll get up from where he was and come towards me either whining/barking/howling/any combo of these. If I get up from where I'm sitting he'll follow me doing those things too. At first I thought he wanted to go use the bathroom and the reason for his whining and barking was because he has a delicate bowel and bladder but 75% of the time he'll just go lay down on the porch. He's definitely not in pain as my grandfather gives him his pain meds every morning when he wakes up. I tried feeding him too but he's not hungry or thirsty. I thought maybe it could be anxiety issues as those breeds are prone to have attachment issues but he does this to me even when my grandfather is home! Im not sure what to do about it because he'll just keep doing it on and on. At one point he did it for almost 15 minutes straight even after I tried addressing any possible needs.	No A-holes here	0	0
c5qihy	2019-06-26 14:30:44		AITA for telling my boyfriend he can't take a job.	"Boyfriend brought up going back to former job for a while to bring in money. I said no because it was a major role in us breaking up before.


So me and my boyfriend have been living together for a month now. During this time he lost his job and has been looking for work. I make good money but it has made things a bit tight. Last night he brought up the idea about going back to his former job at a night club as a bouncer. I told him I was very uncomfortable with the idea and think it would cause more problems then it was worth. He is stressed out and depressed about not working so he was not happy with what I said but understood. 
Background on why I don't want him there:
While we met at this club while he was working there, it was the cause of a major fight that made us break up for three weeks. The people working there would start drama anytime I would be there. Telling him I was pissed off when i wasn't. Plus while he is faithful, he is a flirt and I didn't think he drew a hard enough line when drunk girls were throwing themselves at him. Also it would take away our weekends again.
We are adjusting to living with each other and while there are bumps and fighting we have learned to talk them out and doing very well.  I think that if he takes this job it would be a major step in the wrong direction.

c5qibd	2019-06-26 14:30:17		WIBTA for contacting the employer of a person who hit my car and refuses to take responsibility for it	"Two weeks ago while we were both participating in a multi-organizational state exercise, they backed into my parked vehicle. At the scene it was evident they didn't feel they were responsible, attempting to shift blame onto my vehicles age and some what rusted front. Assuming they was just nervous and giving them the benefit of the doubt, as we both work in positions of trust with the state, I wrote it off. We exchanged contact info however and I was ghosted promptly after asking her to cover my vehicle's damages (this is of course after she reassured me she would do anything needed to help with the situation). I live in a no fault state so going through my insurance provider is impractical due to the deductible cost outweighing the repairs themselves. 

Would it be overkill to inform their employer of this thing? I really don't want to get her fired but at the same time someone in a position of trust being unwilling to take accountability for something they very clearly did (by admission and easily 5 witnesses, all also of positions of trust) shouldn't not face the repercussions of their actions.

The moral hangup is over whether or not this is all even worth it, I've certainly done shitty things before but never to the point of costing someone else a paycheck. They also lied to me and lack the sense of morality expected of their position."		1	0

c5qfij	2019-06-26 14:23:15	WeirdColdCloset	AITA For Defending The Actions of Myself and a Co-Worker?	"I work at a call center within another office. The conditions are horrible and range from working in a windowless closet, the temperature of the closet, and the absolute lack of communication within the company.

Every Thursday the main office has a small party for during the summer and myself and my three co workers are always invited. It's loud so we could not really miss it if we stayed in our closet anyway. Every time we have gone out we have consistently checked back into our closet to make sure that we don't miss any calls. In truth we spend a lot of time doing nothing as calls are not very frequent. 

This most recent Thursday was no different except that our supervisor was actually in the office for the first time. She only works part time and when she is actually in she does not work in our closet. Our main boss is remote and never in the office. Myself and a co worker are invited out to the main office but my co-worker is on point checking for calls every minute or so. She got a call and we go into our closet so she can take the call and I can provide back up.

It's then that we get what I considered to be a pretty passive aggressive instant message from our supervisor. She wrote:

 *Hey guys*

*I'm  not mad or reprimanding or anything, but if you guys want to come out  on these Thursday's let's please have it be one by one or something so  the phones aren't abandoned.* 

Both my co worker and I were not thrilled with this. We felt that we did not do anything wrong, these little parties are a nice respite considering we are sometimes working until 9:00 at night despite that not being communicated to us when we took the job. This person is not even in the office most days and the first day she decides to show up during one of these events she decides to rain on our parade. I responded:

 *Co Worker was consistently checking in and we came in because she saw a call go  through. I went online in case another came in while she was on the on the phone. We were not outside any longer than if one of us was alone  and went to grab lunch or went to the bathroom. Considering Representative of the main office  came in  and informed us things were happening we would look rude or anti social  if we did not go out for the short amount of time that we were.*  

She never replied because my response made her ""So angry"" and Shocked"". This person has constantly flaunted that she gets to go home before 9:00 when she knows we have asked to work from home, made weird comments about how she's above us, and even said *""Ughh another old black guy""* when we found out that our actual boss (the one who always works remotely) was going to hire someone new.  If she had the ability to counter any of my points that I laid out then she should have said so. If we had actually missed a call I would understand her message more but the fact is that we did not. I just don't feel in the wrong for responding."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We ""dated"" for 6 months, I was very unhappy but I felt like breaking up would hurt him, since it was very easy to do so...
I moved on, broke up, and developed many parts in my life, he stayed in the same place. I had issues with his personality, nothing else. 

Almost a year later we meet again, just as friends, but he continuously flirts even though I'm telling him how uncomfortable it's making me. He tries to touch me, and I reject it, we were also accompanied by another friend. Since he was one of the few people I was befriended with, I kept meeting him occasionally. Until I met him at a school party where I had a crush on someone else. That night my crush told me he was with someone and that made me vulnerable and I ended up drinking (not completely drunk) but then I cuddled with my ex, and he saw this as ""we're back together"" I told him I wanted to give it another chance, but not go into a relationship immediately. That was almost two months ago and we've been meeting occasionally, fighting almost every time. I am stupid for putting myself in the same situation, but I thought he changed... Now I want to call it off cause I'm unhappy, but I'm scared of hurting him again (we never agreed that we were in a relationship, but I didn't exactly deny it, which makes me an asshole), I was just afraid of hurting him.

c5qe7i	2019-06-26 14:20:15	CaptMartelo	AITA for half-ghosting on a project?	"Will try to summarize this.

&#x200B;

I graduated in November.

In December I joined a project in my university for an international competition. From the beginning, I said I wouldn't be able to invest much time into it but would help in whatever was asked. As such, my ""official position"" is team coach.

For the following three months (until end of March) I would spend the days at uni working on that project and another one. In March I got a solid proposal from a company and started working full-time in the first of April. Everyone in the team knew this, I told them. So during March I closed whatever I could close and taught the things that only I knew.

Ever since then, every couple of weeks I went to the university to deal with something related to the project. The project's deadline is the end of August and barely anything is done. The ""team leader"" is freaking out, micro-managing and people are tired of him.

&#x200B;

He asked for me to be on top of things. So every couple of weeks I talked to people, to know how their part of the project was going and to help in whatever I could. This week I'll be doing some design stuff, because the girl responsible for that needs my help.

&#x200B;

The team leader is now accusing me of ghosting on the project.

I don't feel like I completely ghosted. I help in whatever I can, but between full-time work and personal life, I know I slightly disappeared from the project. But people knew me already, they would ask and tell me things whenever they saw me. Am I the asshole here? Am I the asshole for not handling something every single day?

It's a 16 members team with professors helping them. Why did it feel like I was needed for everything to progress?"	No A-holes here	0	0

On his first day he made about 35 dollars in a 6 hour shift. I have been supporting us through his unemployment, paying for everything, and generally having to take care of the house as he only does minimal housekeeping while I work for us. I've gotten frustrated with him on multiple occasions about him maybe picking up some house work while I work for us, but he just retorts that unemployment is depressing for him and he can't bring himself to do it. I understand that, I just thought maybe half an hour of work everyday was possible. Break it up maybe? Just something.

I go through phases of being really frustrated with him for not trying to find another job that can actually support him, as it feels like he's just riding out me paying for everything. I am at a point where I want to tell him that I will be paying for my half of things, and he can figure out his half. I feel pretty shitty about it but I also can barely support us as is and I haven't been able to save money at all, which I view as incredibly necessary. WIBTA?

c5qbsx	2019-06-26 14:14:23		AITA for seeking revenge against my bullies	"So years ago, I was in law school and had trouble with a group of girls.

Maybe it was my awkward behavior in a stressful environment but I guess I rubbed them the wrong way and they began to gossip about me. Which was fine until it because so vicious it started to effect my reputation at school. I tried to communicate with them to clear things up and apologize if I did offend them, I had no intent to do so. But they actually avoided me..running away from me in fact and one who I did talk to later accused me of harassing her. After that I put my head down and just kept to myself as they tore my reputation even further. It got so bad I had to seek therapy from the stress of law school and ostracization.

And the low blow was they even accused me of harassing them even when I did not. The school did an investigation and found no evidence in doing so. They tried to end my career before it started.

So you could see how resentful I was towards them but I never sought revenge, I tried to better my life and career...until they cross my path few months ago.

Turns out they started working with one of my best friends at a office. And turns out he hooked up with one of them. During their time together he found out great things about her, unethical things like doing drugs, etc. what’s even more delicious is that she had photos and messages with the other girls doing illegal shit. 

The friend and I then reported them to the proper authorities, they got fired and I then spread all of the gossip among former classmates and peers.

His sander was an old dilapidated piece of shit. It died halfway through the job. Now he swears up and down I broke it and I owe him a new one.  The cord was spliced together so many times the entire thing was held together with electrical tape. When I turned it on it made a god-awful sound, and he told me it was normal.  

Honestly I didn't even want to give him the initial $50 we agreed on. The whole thing was a waste of my time. I could've I had my project finished last weekend, but now it has to wait until this weekend, and my house is complete chaos right now with a half-finished floor. not to mention I have to shell out another $50 to rent another floor sander that actually works.

He was very angry of course and within the next day or two he broke up with her. The wedding is canceled whether they workout the relationship or not. All her bridesmaids including myself had already purchased our dresses, and come to find out we can not return or get refunded on them (each dress was $250-300). We had a beach trip planned for the Bach party which was close to $500 a person. I was asked by the ""bride"" to consult with all the girls planning on going on the trip to see if we wanted to keep the trip booked or try and  get a refund. Out of all the girls only one was opposed to still going and her reasoning was completely understandable. I then inquired about canceling the trip which i was able to with a cancellation fee of $75. I was pretty upset about finding out we could not return the dresses or get any money back. Its not like a bridesmaid dress is something easy to sell especially without losing any money on it. I asked the bride to pay the cancellation fee for the because i did not think it was fair we were all losing money on our dresses, so why should we lose more money? She was very offended that i asked her to pay so all the girls could get their full refund. We got in an argument over the ordeal and we both said some mean things to each other. I want to know was i complete asshole for asking for the cancellation fee? Or is it understandable wanting her to pay it since she was the one who created the problem in the first place?




(I was here for her the min she told me what was happening!! I talked to her on the phone days in a row for hours at a time! As soon as she got home from the business trip i drove the hour to her house to be with her before i had two events that night. I have checked on her every single day since this had happened! I have been on the cheating side i know what it feels like to make mistakes and feel terrible about yourself all too well! This was also not her first time mistake “cheating” on her man. And she was honest with him about the first time after they got engaged and then when this incident happened she told him right away bc she felt bad for waiting so long the first time. They worked it out the first time and got through it and this time the dude is not okay and wants end it. I let my emotions and anger about the dress and stuff get the best of me for sure and i shouldn’t have asked her for the fee with everything being so fresh. But this is the kind of things ppl don’t think about when making poor decisions.)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Sorry for the long post and drawn out timeline.

About 4 years ago W worked at a preschool for roughly one year. She met F and became somewhat friends. They hung out a couple of times (maybe 3-4) and after F quit the preschool she moved to California and their friendship seemed to end. They spoke maybe once or twice after F moved. To be honest, I never liked F, I am an introvert and she was very crass and unapologetic about her drinking, drug use, and sex life, things I don't want or need to know about. During this point W joined a church and starts taking a large interest in religion.

2 years later, F and her husband go through a very nasty divorce and F reaches out to W to talk, since they used to be friends.  F tells W that she feels God brought them together, so W and F begin to talk more during the divorce. During one of their talks, W says that she is concerned that I am not religious, and how that might be affecting our relationship. F tells W that I am ""a distraction from what is truly important in life"" and that W needs to really decide what she values, me or religion. F and W talk a few times before F disappears again and I think the friendship is finally over.

Last year we both decide that W quits her job and goes back to school. She does not go back to work, causing us to go through our emergency fund and build up $5000+ in credit card debt. She is still unemployed, and we have cashed out our roth IRA and cut back on everything to make ends meet.

Yesterday F calls and tells W that she needs to leave California in order to get her life back on track. She says she can either move to Florida and be with her family, where F claims there will be drama since her family disapproved of her marrying and moving to Cali, or move here ""where is the last place F was happy"", but we are the only people she knows. W offered that F and her 2 kids can stay with us until she can find a job and place she can afford. Once I got home from work and W told me I said absolutely not. I feel we are barely able to keep ourselves afloat, let alone a single mother of 2 with a lot of baggage. Am I the asshole for denying a home to someone in need?

c5q6a6	2019-06-26 14:01:03	throwmeaway7147	WIBTA for hanging with my ex’s sisters but not her?	"Every summer I go to my parents place by the lake. Last year I became friends with 3 sisters, eventually striking up a romance with one of them (ex). It lasted for half a year, perhaps a bit more me than her on the effort side. I also visited (and stayed with) ex when I was traveling near her city. We talked a lot, and then she just straight up ghosted me. From I miss you’s and the occasional call to no response whatsoever. We never talked about our relationship so I just thought she got a boyfriend, or was done, but I still don’t know because she completely stopped responding to me (It took me a couple texts to get the message, but I got it). I kept the other two sisters on social media, still talking to them because we were friends. Never a mention of the prior romance I had with their sibling. 

Problem is, now we’re all back staying with our parents, and being forced to see ex when I want to see my friends (other 2 sisters), sucks. The acting like nothing ever happened isn’t really working for me. Imagine sitting next to an ex after it’s been months since they ghosted you. I didn’t enjoy it. I think I just want to be (fully) done with it for a while.

They are all super close and I’m sure she’d wonder why I didn’t invite her out with us (hmm is this one really that tough). But I don’t want to sit at the same table as ex until we at least make an attempt to talk about some things. And it seems like she has no interest whatsoever of doing that. I would say I’m being a huge asshole if she hadn’t ghosted me, but she burned that bridge and let it be so I don’t really have a problem singling her out, or making her sit at home.

Would only inviting her sisters out because I don’t want to see her make me an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5q4lx	2019-06-26 13:56:48	Ozzytex	WIBTA if I closed my Ex-Wife's bank account?	"So long story short, I have suffered a divorce recently. I saw it coming a mile away despite her claims to the opposite, its been over a year now and I have reached the point of just wanting to finally separate her from my 100%. While we were married I realized that she was terrible with money so I kept my account which she had no access to which I used to pay bills and save money, and we had a joint account for her money (which I never touched without permission) which I added to every now and again if she wanted something big IE vacations or something akin to that. 

&#x200B;

A few months after our divorce was finalized I asked her to get her own phone line, and close that account. For the phone I explained in detail I expected her to pay her half of the bill until she could find another service. First month she missed her half I agreed to cover it and she would cover the next in the entirety, another month and she doesn't make the payment, I speak to her about it and she says she is just waiting for a paycheck, two months later and several attempts to communicate, still no payment and they are threatening to shut off my phone...

&#x200B;

So I used our joint account (which had the money and had for weeks) to pay the bill and informed her I did so. Que fireworks. I stated I would not apologize and she should not be surprised that I had access to a bank account with my name on it, and I had warned her it was going to happen if she didn't pay.

&#x200B;

That was the last time I heard her voice over a year ago now (2 years since divorce) and she STILL has not closed the account. I have sent her facebook messages and I have sent her emails with confirmed read/receipt but nothing. She is doing better with cash now and isn't constantly over drafting so maybe she is getting better with it... but I still don't want my name attached to this account. I spoke to the bank about removing my name but they give me the run around saying ""You have to close the account if you want to do that"" because somehow hitting the delete button is beyond their capabilities.   


So now the question.... Its been two years now, she has made 0 progress to close the account and I have learned that the bank will allow me to close the account on my end and the left over money will be available for withdraw in check form at the other end.  Soooo.... WIBTA if I told my X that I was going to close the account in 30 days so get your shit sorted, if not her money will be available at the local bank in her area?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5q2sc	2019-06-26 13:51:59	lululaba	AITA for getting pissed at people who touch my laptop screen?	"It's infuriating. Nobody else in my office seems to care. Every single time I am discussing something with a colleague, they touch my screen to point things out, and I don't just mean touch. I mean tap tap, slide finger across the whole bloody screen, tap tap.

&#x200B;

It even happens with my managers, but I can't say shit. I have mentioned to my colleagues a number of time to not touch my screen. There was even an incident where after I respectfully asked them to stop, they intentionally did it again and said ""what, like this?"" This resulted with me raging and with a raised voice I said ""you are extremely disrespectful and a proper piece of shit."" They took quite an offence to this and other colleagues said I went too far, and that it's ""just a laptop screen.""

Honestly, theres a special dump in hell for these types of people. Don't touch other's screens people.

"I (17M) recieved a call from my sister at 8.00 this morning from my eldest sister (27F) that her skirt ripped at work. As she is a HR manager, looking professional is incredibly important for her job. I asked my other sister at home with me (22F) to drive with me to my eldest sisters work (about a 40 min drive.) She directly refused and went to watch tv, stating that ""I am allowed to relax."" Becuade of this, my brother and I had to drive an extra 2 hours to ensure that my eldest got her skirt.

Now obviously, when we got home, we were pretty pissed. When we said that it was selfish to not help our sister earlier, she said to us, ""well never expect me to help you ever again."" I told her to go fuck herself and went to clean up the house.

Now, my sister told my mum who is threatening to sell my car because I told my sister to go fuck herself and that my sister is being needlessly picked on. Now, I believe that while I did over-react, it was incredibly selfish and wrong for my sister to refuse to help and should apologise. AITA for thinking so?

c5q1rx	2019-06-26 13:49:30	DinnerOnAPlate	AITA For Being Mad When Woken Up?	"Due to ""circumstances"", there are 9 of us staying at our cousin's place. 

  So at the beginning, things were pretty fine. But now you can count on my cousin coming out at 1 AM - 4AM every morning and making noise.

It started a few weeks ago, when she was just testing the waters (she literally turned on the light, look in my direction and turned it back off). I was tolerating it fine for weeks, but now it has progressively gotten worse. I've got an average of 3 hours sleep each night so far this summer.

For this past week here's stuff that they (she and her bf) have done:
-At 1 AM or 2AM she would start playing music or YT videos loudly on her speaker 
-She also turns on the light and starts cooking (so banging pots and pans), and she has a cold so now she hacks and gags loudly all over the place and wakes everyone up while doing so.
- She doesn't go back to her room until 2. I
Her boyfriend then comes out to wash the dishes and I'm woken up by banging pots and pans again at 3AM.

Now this time, my cousin yells out ""REALLY??"" In a way that sounds like she's shocked and annoyed that *I* had the audacity to be at least slightly upset after being woken up.

Now here's how I usually react:
-Kiss my teeth and groan
-Rant to myself or cry
-browse on my phone, suck it up, and don't directly say anything

So this morning, my mother then turns to me and is like ""Oh yeah, when *cousin's name* turned on the light last night, did you really suck your teeth? Lest I remind you that this is her house""

After that I just lost it because I'm at my wits end. My eyes burn from the lack of sleep, I'm experiencing auditory hallucinations, I can't focus at work, etc. I ask her wtf I'm supposed to do then because reacting is apparently a no go.

Well because of the argument I've gotten split responses from those we spoke to. My family and some others said that I'm rude, and that if I don't like it I should just leave (except I can't).

My friends and some other people OTOH say that I every right to react. They acknowledge that I already established it's her house, I'm just tired. They also say that my parents should atleast say something because they pay half the rent for now.

Personally I feel like as long as I'm not actively telling her anything then I should be fine. But maybe I'm wrong. I don't think I'm the asshole, but I think I may need some outside perspective."	Asshole	0	0

c5q1nd	2019-06-26 13:49:10		AITA for parking on public property between two private lots when both of the lot owners have told me I can’t park there?	My neighbors downstairs are both threatening to have my car towed. I live on a mountain and I usually park my car in front of the steps up to my house. There is street parking across the street but it’s on a curve and it’s a narrow road so I don’t like parking over there because I can’t see if anyone’s coming and I don’t want to get my mirror clipped. The people who live next to the stairs told me they don’t want me parking there when they have friends over so I would move my car when they’d ask, but eventually they were just asking me to move every time they were home, and I finally just stopped moving my car. They left a note on my car with their phone number asking to text me whenever they were coming into town (it’s their vacation home) so I can move and I ignored the note. They’ve pounded on my door to yell at my husband. I went down to talk to them once and they said I can’t park on an easement because it’s public property and asked me if I thought I could park on just any sidewalk. I said well if it’s not bothering anyone then sure. Then they had a friend park on the sidewalk perpendicular to both of our cars blocking us in to their lot and the easement. Now the other neighbors are involved too and telling us that we don’t own the property so we can’t park there and put up their own no parking sign by their lot. We’ve checked the plat map and consulted a lawyer and it’s definitely public property. We don’t claim we own it, but we don’t want to be told we can’t park there if it happens to be empty. We don’t want to start a fight, but we’ve been parking there for years and it’s never been an issue and it’s a pretty big inconvenience to park across the street		1	0
c5q14w	2019-06-26 13:47:43	KarateJames	WIBTA If I sent an email on my last day about why I quit?	"I took a temp position at a company when I moved home after my divorce. My real career is very stressful, so I took a low paying, low stress receptionist position, with the intention of just taking a career break to focus on my current transition. Well, it turned out to be high stress and not at all what I signed up for. So when my 6 month contract was up, I decided not to stay and be hired on permanently.

One major factor in my decision is my supervisor. I’ll call her Linda. At first Linda was ok, if not distant. But any time I’d need to ask Linda a question, it was like I was asking for a kidney. She acted so irritated and almost angry that I was even talking to her. And eventually, I discovered that other people on my team feel the same way. She treats everyone as though they were a burden and everyone agrees that she’s intimidating. On top of that she sometimes doesn’t even answer your question. One time I asked her a very easy question, and she threw up her hands and said she didn’t know and kept walking.

When I decided I wasn’t staying, I went to our VP who's also HR and a very kind, understanding, and approachable person. I told her I’d have to move on and that I’d be going back to my career. She understood and thanked me for the time I put in here. And asked me if I’d told Linda. Which is when I told her my experience with Linda and that she was one of the reasons I’m not staying. She acted surprised (which I know is her being diplomatic) and said that she’d take care of it and I wouldn’t have to talk to Linda myself.

While talking to some of my coworkers about leaving, more information about Linda has been unearthed. She’s been written up twice for blowing up at other people. One of them involving her grabbing another person while yelling. That person is one of my closest confidants, Alice. I was telling her about my fantasy of sending an office email as I leave, calling out Linda. Of course Alice thinks I should do it, she’s been praying for Linda’s third strike for a long time.

I know that’s the wrong thing to do. Although it'd feel good to CC the entire office and send it at 5:01 on my last day. Knowing how many people don’t like her, it’d make a lot of people happy. But I can’t do that to another person, no matter how awful.

So the three choices I’ve landed on are:

\-Email just her, telling her she’s the reason I’m gone

\-Email the VP, further detailing events and letting her know I’m concerned for the team and next person in my position, which I most definitely am. I think of this person a lot and feel bad for the trap they’re about to fall into.

\-Do nothing. This office has been dealing with its drama for decades. I don’t need to put in my two cents if I’m leaving. And it might not even matter if I do.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Supervisor is awful. Quitting partially because of her. Would I be an asshole for letting her, and maybe other people, know she’s the reason I’m leaving?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c5pzwo	2019-06-26 13:44:42	Throwawawaway_la	WIBTA if I warn them about the surprise party ahead of time?	"Every year my family has a reunion, which is great, since parts of the family are spread out, and even the family that's near each other don't get to see each other all that often. Every year my mother plans a theme night. Nobody is as into the theme nights as my mom, but she loves to plan that sort of thing. In the past the themes have been things like 20s, luau, etc. It's always pretty cute stuff.

In the last year, my cousin and her boyfriend got engaged, and everyone is pretty excited about it. They are planning to have a 2 person destination wedding in another country - you know, eloping. 

Here's the issue: for the theme night this year my mom has planned a surprise wedding shower, and I've been debating with myself whether or not I should warn them. Personally, I would HATE to be put on the spot like that, and it's definitely coloring my opinion. Since they're eloping, they might not be interested in all the ceremonial stuff, they're not super traditional in that way. If I was the one engaged, I would DEFINITELY want a heads up. But I'm not totally sure if messaging one of them to say ""hey, my mom might be plotting a surprise wedding shower for you guys, just so you're not totally blindsided"" would ruin the surprise. Especially since my cousin to be is a little shy and I'm not sure what he would think about being the center of attention in our very loud family.

So, what do you think? Would I be the asshole if I shot my cousin or her fiance a message saying ""hey, you know theme night? This year the theme might be the wedding you're not having! Act surprised!"".... Or should I just let it play out?"	Asshole	0	0

c5pydy	2019-06-26 13:40:56	DeplorableDogTrainer	WIBTA if I asked my boss for more earning opportunities, even though it means taking some away from a coworker?	"I've been a professional dog trainer for 4 years, had my own small business and everything. 2 months ago, I moved and was immediately hired as a full-time lead dog trainer within a popular pet-store chain. I was able to go through the company training in 1/4 of the time because of my knowledge and extensive background, got my company certification, and started selling and teaching classes immediately. However, I got my certification around the same time as one of my coworkers, let's call her Julie, and later found out she was hoping for the full-time position that I was hired for. 

&#x200B;

I have more experience and qualifications than Julie, hence why I was selected for the position. I also am the only one of my store's four dog trainers that has sold any classes in the past month, and single-handedly filled our \*\*store's\*\* quota (a goal that in theory is met by cumulative efforts of all 4 trainers). I've also come to notice that Julie absolutely hates me and is nasty at every chance, and I deal with it because I don't want to create more hostility. Julie has also only sold 1 small class in the entire time I've been with the company (and been on the floor during peak hours), whereas I've sold 20 classes in the last month alone. Something like this wouldn't bother me if I didn't need (and frankly, deserve) the commisions I make for sales on classes I teach. 

&#x200B;

While I can try and get customers signed for my classes, I only have a certain number pre-scheduled, and Julie was in charge of creating the schedule, so of course I have the least desirable slots and 12. She however has 25 class slots in the next 5 weeks alone, but never sells any (I've sold half of her previous classes for her, but since i'm not the instructor for the class, I don't recieve any incentives).

&#x200B;

 Like I said, none of the other trainers have sold any classes this past month, and in order to make the sales, and because I have very few class slots, I end up having to register customers to my coworkers. Each sale I make that goes to another trainer is an additional $20-$70 that I won't get, even though I did all the work convincing the customer to buy a fairly expensive service. Would I be the asshole if I asked my boss to let me have additional class slots/earning opportunities more proportionate to the level of work I'm doing, even if it means taking away from a coworker that doesn't even try?"

My best friend (we'll call her B) has been planning on having a night out with me and two of her other close friends for her 21st birthday in a couple of weeks. She really wanted me to come. I really wanted to go. 

Problem is, my dad has been planning a trip out of the county with me for several months now, and there was always a chance it was going to coincide with B's birthday party. I'm not sure when I would get an opportunity with my dad like this again.

I warned her about this and made it clear that I very much wanted to come, but couldn't commit for sure. 

Her party was originally planned during the week. I 100% would have been able to go on the originally planned day. 

However, a few days ago (two weeks before the party) she realized she had scheduled herself to work on her birthday and wouldn't have much time to celebrate. 

I suggested that maybe she have a small celebration with her family that day and then have her celebration with friends on the weekend instead. I told her I would do my best to steer my dad away from scheduling the trip that weekend. 

However, yesterday my dad informed me that he scheduled the trip for the weekend she scheduled her party. I let her know right away that I wouldn't be able to make it, and offered up that I could take off from work and celebrate with her on one of her days off work that week to make it up to her. 

She's been angry with me ever since. Basically told me she didn't ""understand"" why I was going, and when I said it was to spend time with my dad (who is always working), she snapped back about how it was a business trip and that I wouldn't be able to spend time with my dad anyways. Acted like I was just making that up because I didn't want to go. (But my dad is going over there to look for a new job, and taking a break from his demanding job that makes it impossible for him to spend time with me. So considering that he *will* have more time to spend with me than back home) 

I'm honestly at a loss. I feel awful about not going, but at the same time I warned her and she did have to reschedule the party with not much notice.

 Am I the asshole here? Should I just skip the trip with my dad and go to her party instead?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So my mom has often done things to hurt my dad (slander, humiliation, and even tried to frame him). She often complains about him even though they've been divorced for almost 9 years. She would even try to turn me against him or pretend to be me when she texts him to be ugly then lie to me about random shit about him. As much as I love my mother to pieces, she constantly drives me away with her nasty behavior.

The reason I'm making this post is I honestly feel guilty standing up to her when she tries to tell me how much she hates him and blahblahblah. Even when she threatens me with either grounding me, etc. for just telling her what she's doing is wrong. She constantly tells me things to make me stay (I love you more than anything, please don't leave me, your dad is a druggie and I'm the only one supporting you, etc. etc.)

She also has a drinking addiction and I hate dealing with that because she gets 10x worse.

Around 9:30 PM tonight, I was driving home with my kinda elderly parents- traffic got really slow on the main thoroughfare, so we decided to slip through some less populated, sketchier side streets. 

In one of the side streets, we saw a man splayed out on the side of the road/sidewalk. He looked passed out, and we couldn’t really tell how long he’d been there by looking at him. There wasn’t any blood, or signs of struggle. 

I guess maybe we should have helped him out for obvious reasons- but we didn’t. It wasn’t really the most populated or safest area, and honestly my family was more concerned with each other’s safety- what if it was one of those things people do to get you out of your car then beat you up? 

I do hope the man is alright :(

c5puy2	2019-06-26 13:31:48		AITA for being jealous of my boyfriend's ex because he proposed to her/king of loved her?	"They were together for about 6 years. She did not get along with his family. At some point he proposed to her and she said yes. They broke up horribly and she destroyed him to his core. His morals, reasoning, attitude, ext. were shaken. He (29 M) moved back home with his family. His mother told me she was worried he was really worried about him. I (28 F) moved here 4 years ago from the West coast and I also got out of a long-term soured relationship. We met online and turns out we were less than 20 minuets from each other. He states he is done with marriage and love but somehow, we are dating. It seems that he cannot get past this life event and I ache for him. I want to move on with him but now he never wants to leave his family again. This means moving in together somewhere is not an option. The only way I could live with him would to move in with him and his family, which I have made known that I would like to do in the future to be with him. 
I am also jealous of his new nephew whom he states he was “forced to love because he’s family.” When his younger sister got pregnant, he was horrified, shocked and disgusted. He also says things like “I need to be there for my nephew” (the parents of the nephew are kind of shitty) This nephew is also kind of doomed for this reason. The family home feels like a commune where you can come and go. 

Despite what he says I believe he has changed. We don’t say “I love you” but we care. We have been together for 4 years. I'm not asking to be married now, but i would like to know it is an option. I say to myself if we are together in 5 years I will propose to him. Any feedback is appreciated. I can update and add information as needed.
Thank you most sincerely, my friends.

c5pu18	2019-06-26 13:29:26	slapmybulge	AITA for refusing to stop being friends with someone my sister dated?	"Alright so here’s some back story. 

My sister dated a guy in grade 9?10? And their relationship lasted for a couple years. During this time, me and her bf became pretty close friends. He got me into music (which I am thankful for and love doing). As I said, they were together for a couple years so when it came time for when they broke up, they stopped talking to each other. After that, me and him stopped talking for a bit. We started talking again after a while and we started wanting to hang out, but, my sister found out and ratted me out to my mother who (plus my sister) told me I shouldn’t be friends with him. My sister then kept calling me gay for wanting to be friends with him, saying we were in a relationship. Next thing I know, they’re dating again. We all are hanging out and talking then boom, they break up again, and again, and again. This was back in November/December 2018. As of now I still talk to him but it’s secretive cause I don’t want them to bug me about it. We hang out a lot and chill, make music, go around to different places to make videos, shoot music videos for the music we make, just all these different things.

According to the process server, he is evading service (not answering the door when his truck is in the driveway, dog is barking, and TV on in this house). All of this is costing me money. I heard from a family member that he is in rehab for the next month. Evidently he OD’ed and about died. I should note that he is a “professional” and has plenty of money to be paying me child support, but doesn’t. My attorney says we should have him served papers there, since we know where he is. I get that he is trying to get better and I acknowledge that this is a mental health issue. Is serving him papers in rehab too much of an asshole move?

c5pqgc	2019-06-26 13:19:54		AITA for taking my sister's dog until she becomes responsible?	"My sister was on vacation three months ago but was looking for a new puppy since her prior dog recently passed. She found a breeder in another city and asked me to travel and pick up the dog, hold onto it for a couple of weeks until she returns, then give her the dog. It was $400 and she paid me in advance to pay the breeder.

My wife and I went and fell in love with the puppies, so we got one ourselves. One for us, one for my sister. So we had two sister pups under our care until my sister came home and picked hers up. I'll admit it was tough letting the puppy go after getting to know her for two weeks but it was our agreement with my sister.

Four days ago my sister asked us to puppysit while she's out of town for a couple of days. We gladly did, and our own puppy was all the more chipper for it. But her puppy really stank of pee. Like two baths worth to just get her to smelling normal. She also was not housebroken despite our own accomplishing this in a month. She didn't really exhibit good behavior or anything, so we asked my sister over Skype and it turns out she's abusing the dog.

Off the top of my head she says she keeps her in her crate for pretty much the whole day, sometimes consecutive days. She doesn't train or even attempt to train, nor wash the cage or doggy bed/blanket when she messes inside the crate. We went to my sister's apartment and the dog's blanket in the case weighs a lot, just full of pee upon pee. There's also a short leash in the cage, I guess she leashed her in the case so she can barely move.

I wired the $400 to my sister's account and said we're keeping the dog, here's your money back. We'll give the dog back if she takes a training course, we'll even pay for it (it's one day a week for 8 weeks). She freaked out and it's causing a rift in our family; I'm trying to be discreet because our whole family is dog lovers and we don't want word out she's being abusive. We're giving her an opportunity to better herself while no one else knows, then she'll get the dog back.

Are we being assholes for effectively stealing the dog? We love both puppies, they get along well. In the interim, we're going to start training and if I can be honest, we hope my sister doesn't follow through so we can keep the dog. But we're giving her a chance.

tl;dr: we bought sister a dog, she's abusing the dog, big time, so we took the dog back on the condition she takes a training course, then we'll give the dog back."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c5pqds	2019-06-26 13:19:42	LiquidSpirits	WIBTA if I told my classmate to focus on her own clothing instead of mine because she needs it more than I do?	I'm going through a phase of experimentation at the moment. I wear dresses and bowties, skirts and caps. I feel comfortable in all of it though. For context, I'm female and 15 years old. A female classmate of mine (who used to be my friend for like two years but I ended the friendship because she was manipulative) keeps commeting on it. She laughed when I showed up to a formal event in a bowtie, asks me stuff like 'what even is your style right now?' or 'will you ever settle on something?'. Ever since I ended the friendship we haven't been talking much. This is literally the only interaction we have. Would it be too much to tell her to focus on her own style because she dresses like a 10 year old?	Asshole	0	0
c5ppzj	2019-06-26 13:18:33		AITA for storming off during a conversation?	"Yesterday, I was eating lunch in my dorm's cafeteria. I was soon joined by my three roommates and some people on our floor. We all started talking about classes, movies, etc. Soon the topic shifted to sex, to which I just kept eating quietly since I'm mostly a very quiet person. For some background information, I've never had a girlfriend and I'm still a virgin.

One of the guys asked me how many ""kills"" I had so far. I asked what he meant and everyone chuckled saying it meant how many people I'd had sex with. I replied saying I hadn't and everyone gasped and started laughing. They said they couldn't believe it and that I really need to ""get myself laid"".

Everyone jumped on the topic and piggy-backed off each other, offering me tips and tricks on how to get laid. I told them I appreciated it, but I was fine. They asked why and kept pressing for an answer. I told them it was because I didn't have time for a girlfriend at the moment and I wasn't interested in having sex outside of a relationship. They all freaked out even more than before and told me I was missing out. Once again, I told them I appreciated their concern but was okay with having fun other ways. They blew it off and started pressuring me to lose my v-card to this one girl on our floor and started telling me that she was really easy to get with and what not.

At this point, I was pretty fed up with the whole conversation. I told them that I didn't appreciate them telling me what to do with my body, to which they called me ""close-minded"", ""prude"" and ""boring"". They said that I should ""live a little"". At that point, I got up, picked up my tray, and moved to the very front end of the cafeteria. I watched the front TV until I finished my lunch and left. I could hear them snickering all the way from the back of the cafeteria the entire time. So far, I have not seen them or spoken to them. Did I overreact? AITA?"		1	0

c5poiv	2019-06-26 13:14:47	happyunicorn666	AITA for not wanting to kiss my sick girlfriend?	"Pretty simple. My gf is sick, I'd rather not get sick too so I don't want to kiss her/have her kissing me on neck, etc. She's​ very affectionate which can be a problem in situations like these.

She thinks it's unreasonable, but I already got sick this way in the past so it's not like I'm just paranoid. I know it's not some life threatening disease, but even so I'd rather not get sick if I can prevent it.

This paragraph is here just to satisfy automoderator so the post won't be taken down. Seriously, why do the mods think every post needs tons of explanation. Some can be pretty simple and unnecessary padding just makes them repetitive.

Edit: I should add that when she's sick it lasts some three to four days. I don't think it's that much. We don't live together, today I came to visit her and she said I may as well have stayed at home if I didn't want to kiss her.

We had fun together and enjoyed each other's company. I knew from the start that she had a bad temper and when she got angry, she could say some very hateful stuff, but I was always telling myself she didn't do those with me and she was my friend...

As time passed, I noticed how domineering she was. Always right in everything - showing me and everyone she was better. As I knew she had some self-wort issues and was overcompensating, I accepted that as well. What was getting beyond what I could accept was how she was measuring who put more into the friendship. She never noticed my efforts, but constantly wanted to give even when it was too much. Not accepting was not a solution, but I couldn't thank her or give her back enough... Also, she often criticised me in front of mutual friends about my insecurities and sometimes I felt it was downright abusing.

When I tried to save the friendship after she became very verbally abrasive with me, she flipped out. Called me all things bad on Earth, told me I never deserved her, and blocked me (this is just the short version, it was really awful) .

Fast forward... I've already accepted the death of the relationship, which actually really hurt, when she again contacted me. Wanted to apologize, saying she has been working on herself and realized she must do better, not act out immediately. I agreed to meet her to talk. It was fine, a closure for me. I forgave her and told her it's good she realized she can't treat others like that. She asked to be friends again. I said I would try.

Slow forward. It's not working for me. We talked and met a couple of times, but even though she has been making an effort, I can see how she has to swallow down the criticism when she disagrees. When she blames me for things. She still trying to one up me all the time. She is trying, but she is the same. And I know all it would take is one misstep on my part. I have no trust for her, unfortunately, and I feel uncomfortable.

I'm not angry at her and I don't hate her. But at this point this is not a friendship. She has reached out a couple of times to hang out, but I have been busy, so I could give her excuses. AITA for ghosting her to avoid another drama with verbal abuse that I know would come?

Edit: OK, seems I missed a key information. I did answer all her messages just wasn't very enthusiastic. Couldn't meet her as I was very busy, and realized during this time that rekindling the friendship was not possible on my end. She hasn't tried contacting me for a while now."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Now today when i woke up and gotten ready i put on some clothing that we bought about a month ago? If i remember correctly. They were nothing fancy just a graphic tea and some grey cargo shorts.

My mom came into my room and told me to put on some older clothing that ive had for years at the same caliber. I told her i didnt want to change because i did not care if got paint on my clothes. Im still gunna wear them anyway.

She then told me in a pretty stern and loud voice that ""I didnt care if i RUINED the clothes that my dad worked hard to get for me"" and i thought the argument was kinda petty and were a middle class family in a suburban area. Im not trying to downplay what my dad does for us. I am grateful for it its just she was trying to guilt me and it was obvious and frankly petty over clothes. I did change however as to not provoke her any further but i still kinda believe im in the right here.

c5pmom	2019-06-26 13:10:00		AITA for deleting ex's Instagram?	"My ex(22M) and I(22F) decided last year that we were going to quit our jobs to travel for some time. We were living together for two years before buying one way tickets to Bali, selling our furniture, rehoming our cat, and quitting.

Two weeks into our travels, I found foreign handwriting in our notebook. I asked him, and he said it belonged to some Russians that he met at a restaurant. I didn't dwell on the topic because I wanted him to make friends. Even female ones.

Four weeks in, he says he wants to break up. We had been fighting but I thought that it was just a combination of culture shock and spending too much time together. I started to cry and he says that we can try to fix things by going off for the weekend to a nearby island. We leave the next day and swim with manta rays, go sightseeing, and mess around at the pool.

A week later he breaks up with me...the day before my birthday. I gave him a letter (pathetic ik) and after he reads it he says that we can start new by ""gradually dating"" again. I asked if this was him trying to get a pass to also see other girls and he says no. I told him that as long as we are still exclusive and dating... then okay. I could handle us staying in separate hotels/homestays.

The next day he wishes me a happy birthday and asks if I would be ready at 8pm for our date. I stayed over at his place and the next morning I brought up how I love the way that he held me and kissed me the night prior. He said he remembered cuddling but not kissing me. I said something like ""how can you forget? it's not like you can kiss just anyone like that."" He smirked and said nothing.

During lunch he asked me which languages I wanted to learn. I answered and asked him the same. He replied, ""Russian.""

Remembering the handwriting, I asked if it was because of the people he met weeks ago. He told me, ""No, I just think Russians are cool.""

Feeling icky, I snooped in our shared laptop's search history find ""Survival Guide to Dating Russian Women.""

I confronted him and he said that she was just a friend and that ""it's just something I look up."" He leaves, and I hack into his Instagram. I find dozens of dirty messages with girls, including the one who he said was just a friend. While I paid for us to save our relationship by snorkeling with sea creatures, he was telling her ""I want to bring you here"" and ""I can't wait to adventure with you tomorrow."" The best one is a message of just her name ""Adelinnaaaa"" sent right before he used me to hump in the pool.

My cousin messaged the girl and she revealed that they meet often and they had kissed.

I gave his password to my sister who then proceeded to comment on all of his pictures exposing him as a cheater. Then she deleted his account with my permission. He has 10k followers and I was just totally wanting revenge. I wanted to sabotage the account since I was the one taking the photos that he was using to flirt with other girls. He recovered his account."		1	0
c5plf8	2019-06-26 13:06:33	derussianchef	AITA because I've started calling my boyfriend's SIL out on her weird behaviours?	"I'm not super good at brevity so forgive me if this gets long. I'll put a TL;DR at the end if it meeds it.

I [22M] have been seeing my boyfriend [24M] for two years now. He's great, our relationship is great, his family is mostly great. The exception is his SIL. She never does anything especially mean or cruel, really, she's just...fucking weird. Some examples of her behaviour; 

- My parents are Russian. I have a Russian name. My first name is not an especially common name here in the UK, but it *is* a very well known Russian name and there's a very famous Russian author with my name. Point is, though most people here don't know anyone with my name, most people have encountered it and it's not difficult to spell or pronounce, really. For some reason, SIL has a horrible time of it. She's known me two years, and still insists she's no clue how to spell or say my first name and will either deliberately spell it wrong and cross it out a bunch of times or will just use the Anglicised version. I don't mind the latter hideously, but you understand how that would get annoying. 

- She has a habit of makong really dodgy jokes about people when they're not there. Example: boyfriend's sister has a history of eating problems, for which she's now well in recovery. When I was planning the cake I was making for her birthday, I asked what flavour she preferred and SIL said ""does it matter if she's not gonna keep it down anyway?""

- She doesn't tell lies about huge things that actually matter, but she bullshits about minor, nonsensical things. For example, she told me that she went to a certain bar and got super fucked up on strawberry margaritas. My friend works in said bar and, not only did she say SIL was drinking cider and barely tipsy when she left, they don't even serve strawberry margaritas. 

Like I said. Weird behaviour, and it's starting to get on my wick end, so I've started calling her out on it whenever she does it. Like, if she makes a big deal out of my name I'll say ""come on, I told you this last time did you forget already?"", if she makes one of her sketchy jokes I'll tell her I don't get it and ask her to explain why it's funny and if she says something I know is a lie (e.g. the one above) I'll say something like ""oh that's weird Mandy works there and she said they don't do strawberry margaritas"". I feel like I'm justified in doing this because she's being weird, but a couple of people have told me I should stop because it bothers her and also makes things awkward. AITA? Should I stop? 

TL;DR: bfs SIL pretends she can't spell my name, makes dodgy jokes constantly and lies about arbitrary nonsense. I'm sick of it, so I've started calling her out whenever she does it. Others have said it's awkward and bothers her, but I don't think I should stop."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Trips, computers, never missed a birthday, special treats, etc. We recently had a falling out. We saw them at Christmas and it was awkward, but everyone was civil and we have seen them a few more times without incident. 

I heard from a family member that my sister-in-law was thinking of buying a membership for my daughter to a local museum. The museum is nice, but I thought my daughter would like a different membership better so I sent her a text letting her know that. She never responded, but we don’t talk much so I didn’t think anything about it. 

My daughter’s birthday came around and they RSVP’d “no” to her party and sent a card, but no gift. I waited a few days thinking it was coming from Amazon, but nothing. Just a card. 

We have had our ups and downs, but I never thought they would cut off my kids!! Money isn’t an issue. They make twice as much as everyone else, their house is paid off and they don’t have kids.

c5pk05	2019-06-26 13:02:47	PumpkinDonutsss	AITA for wanting to play my own playlist on the radio while I'm in my friend's car?	"Last weekend me and five of my friends decided to go to the beach. We agreed that we would just bring one car and ride together, so we took the SUV owned by a girl I’ll call Jenna. She is the only one among us who has an SUV so her car was our only choice.

Jenna has a very diverse taste in music. Sometimes she plays ‘normal’ music like what’s currently topping the charts, sometimes it’s violin instrumentals by that German guy with long hair, sometimes it’s movie soundtracks like the one from Pacific Rim. And those are great. But sometimes it’s also Japanese rock, Dutch hip hop or French rap. No one understands the lyrics and the music can be grating, so that’s annoying. Another annoying habit she has is that her playlist is usually just less than 20 songs that she puts on repeat. 

On that day, she was playing French rap and after 2 hours of listening to the same unintelligible jarring sounds, I got tired of it. So I took my phone out and told her that I want to play my playlist on her radio. I asked her what her what the PIN was, she told me and I connected my phone to play my playlist. All our other friends were relieved that we didn’t have to hear French rap anymore. 

We went to the beach, had a fun day and went home. And then yesterday one of our friends messaged me to tell me that Jenna talked to him and said it was out of line for me to play my playlist in her car, even though she herself gave me her PIN so I could connect my phone to her radio.

For my part I think that asking to change the music after listening to something you don’t understand and don’t like for two hours is not out of line. I think it wouldn’t hurt to be considerate of other people you are with, specially when you know that they don’t appreciate the same things you’re into. She can always listen to those songs when she’s alone or with other people who like them also. But it’s definitely not great to force other people to listen to something they don’t like just because they’re inside your car.

c5pip6	2019-06-26 12:59:10	OviedosVeryOwn	AITA not tagging a photographer in the photos they took of me? (On Facebook)	"A few years ago I deactivated my Facebook account. I was going through a really bad time and I just wanted everyone to forget I existed. Fast forward a few years, things are better, and my wife convinced me to re-activate it and update the profile a little. I’ve been doing that slowly over the past couple of weeks. 

We recently had a special occasion in our relationship which apparently justifies a professional photoshoot. I disagreed with the concept but went along with it so my wife would be happy. We paid a professional photographer about $200 for a couple hours of shots and then later on, edits. The photographer sent us a few “sneak peaks” through Facebook the night of the shoot. 

My profile picture was from 4 years ago, and this was the first time I came into possession of a photo of myself since then (I don’t believe in selfies). So I immediately made one of these sneak peaks my profile picture, and logged off. A week later, I logged back in and saw that a week ago, I got a friend request from the professional photographer. I added her, did my normal Facebook routine, and logged off. 

Now my wife is telling me I’m an asshole and I’ve broken social media etiquette because I added the photographer as a friend yet didn’t tag her in the photos she took. I didn’t give her any credit in Facebook actually, I just used the photo. I understand where my wife is coming from but I also gave the photographer $200 in cash right after the shoot so I think that more than makes up for whatever exposure would come from the handful of people who actually see the photos on my profile. On top of that, I don’t really want strangers to see my shit, I have my Facebook set to extremely private because of a crazy ex girlfriend so I don’t want someone I don’t know that well to be able to share pictures that are connected to my profile. If she wants to host the pictures themselves on her page, go ahead, but I don’t want there to be any links back to my profile. So I am refusing to tag her. Does that make me an asshole?"

My doctor sent me to an ENT, who said I have acid reflux and she prescribed me medicine to take for six months.

My mom was there with me and she had a freakout. She said we're not picking up the prescription for PPIs (medication for reflux) because her doctor once gave her the same thing, and when she Googled it, she found some study about it causing stomach cancer. She said I don't need such strong pills at 16 and that I should just drink lemon water and aloe vera in the morning to neutralize the acid. Because that's what she does.

I normally don't go against my mom's wishes but I don't really trust her on this because she's too paranoid about any sort of medication. She won't even take her pills for high blood pressure, because she thinks diet and meditation can solve almost any physical problem. But I really don't want my throat issues getting worse.

c5phze	2019-06-26 12:57:12	edgeofeventwhoreizon	AITA for missing boyfriend's and friends' diploma receiving and making bf cry at commencement	"So a couple days ago, I went to the bf's and friends' graduation ceremony. There was me and 3 other mutual friends as their guest. After 2 hours of founder/advisor/grad talking we started to get hungry, so one of us (let's say him Bryan) offered to go to dinner, (on campus) told that there is more to diploma receiving and we all agreed. We told Bryan to send message to WhatsApp group about we have left for dinner but if receiving starts before we come back, they can inform us. It turned out that Bryan didn't send the message for half an hour and we have missed the receiving part.

&#x200B;

After that we met at after ceremony cocktail. My boyfriend told that he looked for me but couldn't see while receiving, it was a dissappointment to him. After 1 hour arguing and talking, he started crying and said that I have ruined the day for him. And one of the grad friends told that we are all assholes and dumbasses who couldn't manage to go hungry for 30 minutes. There was no point for us to come if we have missed the receiving moment.

In my defense,

1. I had not eaten anything for one and a half days.
2. Bf always complains about I am too intense and falling over on him, I should be more casual. It seemed to me casual to leaving for dinner without the enormous anxiety of missing the diploma receiving. (Which is my true self without my intentionally intervention on being casual)
3. Since I don't have a close relationship with anyone but my bf and I don't know the rules of casual caring, I assumed that our 3 mutual friends know and it wouldn't be a big deal if we miss it, we were there for them after all.
4. Bf's parents live in an other city. They were not planning to come to the commencement due to transportation and accommodation expenses. He had to convince them by booking their place. When I've asked if he will be upset if they don't show up, he told me that it would be unpleasant but not a biggie. Thence I didn't think it is a super important day to him."	Asshole	0	0

I have a bunny in a big wooden cage I built myself, strong and resistant.
My neighbors have two big dogs, a Rotweiller and a Whippet. Sometimes happens that they escape and run into my garden aiming directly for my rabbit.

Once I told my neighbor that if it happened again, I'd have used firecrackers to scare the dogs and make the run away.
Instead when happened again I sprayed the dogs with hose, as I was watering plants outside, hoping that would scare and make them go away.

My neighbors complained because I soaked wet their dogs, I responded that it wouldn't have happened if their dogs didn't escape.

Plus, their dogs aren't instructed, they have lo literally grab them and bring them away with brute force.

Not that I care about, but now they barely say hello when they meet me in the street.

Am I The Asshole for threating them of firecrackers and spraying them with water?

EDIT: I know I should buy a gate, but I've got Work in Progress atm, so I can't until I finished.

EDIT 2: The firecracker thing was basically a threat for my neighbors, not really meany to use them. Although I have a bunch in my kitchen, I'm afraid they'll scare the bunny to death, and the dog may become really agressive.

UPDATE: Happened an hour ago: I have another neighbor who has a Labrador that sometimes is left free. When it's left free it often comes to my house 'cause we give him some old food. This dog is good and sweet, not very well educated, but listens to his owner. Most important, it's not interested at all in my rabbit, so we let him roam a bit in the garden until the owner calls him home. So tonight it happened that it escaped and after a bit of wandering, it went to the main road when some tables were disposed. I followed to catch him, and the A** neighbor was sitting outside the bar. As she saw me catching the labrador and bringing him back home pulling his collar, she said out loud: ""Here's the hose guy"". I ignored her and brought the dog to his owner.
Now I've decided that if their dogs escape again I'll call the police straight away, as I'm tired of dealing with stupid jerks."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5phh5	2019-06-26 12:55:53	Danigirl_03	AITA if I don’t invite my family to my wedding?	"My Fiancé and I are planning on a winter 2020/21 wedding. There are 2-3 different plans we’re floating. But all of the options are less than 15 people weddings. We just really don’t care about having the big party and all the other stuff that goes along with it. He’s widowed I’m divorced and at this point we’ve been together 4 years living together 3 years. 

I don’t care if we have anyone at our wedding besides us and our daughter. I really don’t getting married is about us not anyone else. My fiancé wants some close friends who are like family there and have been in his life for 20plus years. His parents and brother are deceased and his sister and him haven’t gotten along basically ever. 

I live near my mom, but she basically blew up our relationship in December and I was no contact for about 6 weeks calling down. She’s now pretending nothing happened and everything is just hunky dory. I’m having minimal contact on my own terms. I’ve seen my mom maybe 4 times since December. I have two biosisters as well both married with kids and I went to both of their weddings. I get along with my sisters from a distance. But I see them in person once a year and every single time it’s a shit show of how many buttons can I push to annoy the shit out of me. I have an aunt and grandma that if I had a traditional wedding I’d be expected to invite as well.  But I see them at the major events I’m expected to be at like Easter. And since I’m not my cousin, my grandma doesn’t care since that’s her golden grandchild. 

I just want to get married with people who actually love and care about us there. I don’t want to mention it to my family, I don’t want to invite my family, I basically want to call them when it’s done and deal with the fall out. I don’t want to deal with the whining and bitching about the price and cost to come. I don’t want to deal with everyone complaining about why we’re doing it this way. I just don’t want to deal with any of it. Because I know my parents are cheap and none of our options would be classed as affordable to attend. 

I don’t want to deal with my wedding being made to be about anyone other than we’re becoming an official family and cementing our life together. I also really don’t want to have to upgrade packages, and spend double the cost on food to go from 5-6 people plus the 3 of us to add another 11 people just my immediate family. 

Would I be the asshole, if I tell them afterwards and omit the part about the 5-6 people who would come. 2 of which would be our witnesses?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5phcb	2019-06-26 12:55:31		AITA for deleting ex's instagram?	"My(22F) ex boyfriend(22M) decided last year that we were going to quit our jobs to travel for some time. We were living together for two years before buying one way tickets to Bali, selling our furniture, rehoming our cat, and quitting. 

Two weeks into our travels, I found foreign handwriting in our notebook. I asked him, and he said it belonged to some Russians that he met at a restaurant. I didn't dwell on the topic because I like for him to make friends. Even female ones. 

Four weeks in, he says he wants to break up. We had been fighting but I thought that it was just a combination of culture shock and spending too much time together. I started to cry and he backtracks and says that we can try to fix things by going off for the weekend to a nearby island. We leave the next day and swim with manta rays, go sightseeing, and mess around at the pool. 

A week later he breaks up with me...the day before my birthday. I gave him a letter (pathetic ik) and after he reads it he says that we can start new by ""gradually dating"" again. I asked if this was him trying to get a pass to see other girls and he says no. I told him that as long as we are still exclusive and dating... then okay. I could handle us staying in separate hotels/homestays. 

The next day he wishes me a happy birthday and asks if I would be ready at 8pm for our date. I stayed over at his place and the next morning I brought up how I love the way that he held me and kissed me the night prior. He said he remembered cuddling but not kissing me. I said something like ""how can you forget? it's not like you can kiss just anyone like that."" He smirked and said nothing. 

During lunch he asked me which languages I wanted to learn. I answered and asked him the same. He replied, ""Russian.""

Remembering the handwriting, I asked if it was because of the people he met weeks ago. He told me, ""No, I just think Russians are cool.""

Feeling icky, I snooped in our shared laptop's search history find ""Survival Guide to Dating Russian Women.""

I confronted him and he said that she was just a friend and that ""it's just something I look up."" He leaves, and I hack into his Instagram. I find dozens of dirty messages with girls, including the one who he said was just a friend. While I paid for us to save our relationship by snorkeling with sea creatures, he was telling her ""I want to bring you here"" and ""I can't wait to adventure with you tomorrow."" The best one is a message of just her name ""Adelinnaaaa"" sent right before he used me to hump in the pool. 

My cousin messaged the girl and she revealed that they had kissed after he told her that we had broken up a while ago.

I gave his password to my sister who then proceeded to comment on all of his pictures exposing him as a cheater. Then she deleted his account with my permission. He has 10k followers and I was just totally wanting revenge.  I wanted to sabotage the account since I was the one taking the photos that he was using to flirt with other girls. He recovered his account."		1	0
c5pgr2	2019-06-26 12:53:43	youkillmewell11	AITA for not giving up banking information?	"Posting on behalf of my mom.  She loves reddit and this thread so much, but she is afraid that posting will bite her in the ass somehow. So, here I am. 

My younger sister is buying a house. She, her husband, and two kids are in the process right now and are set to close soon. 

My parents gave her money as a gift to help her out and my sister had to make that information available to her loan lender because the money was put in her bank account (At any point, correct me if I’m wrong regarding the “buying a house” information. My husband and I became homeowners two years ago but the process is such a blur). Anyway, because of this gift, my sister’s lender contacted my mom by email asking for her bank account information. 

To me, unless my parents got caught up in being co-signers (which my parents never agreed to), why would the lender need my mom’s information? 

When my mom got the email, she asked my sister about it but my sister kind of danced around it and wouldn’t say what is was for, just to sign it. My mom and dad both said no, that they wouldn’t sign anything because they are afraid of my sister and her husband defaulting on the house, and then my parents will both be screwed in retirement. My sister told my mom that she won’t bring her kids around unless she signs it, and my mom feels so guilty but she’s also trying to protect herself here. She wanted me to post on here because she truly is torn and doesn’t know if she’s the asshole or not- not a validation post at all. She doesn’t know what to do.  

Some relevant information- My sister is 20. She had her first daughter at 17 and my parents took her and her then boyfriend (now husband) in for a year so they could get on their feet. My parents have always given them money when they asked, paid bills for them, and have given both of their children more than they could ever need. Neither my sister or her husband have steady work and I really question how she is able to get a loan for a house."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I didn't really get along too well with his side of the family or my dad either for that matter. He was pretty abusive through the years both physically and mentally but despite all that it isn't the reason for my decision.

Mainly I made the design because I felt more in touch with my mums side, the Spanish side in me vs the Irish side of my father.

I had expressed the desire to change my name to my mum who made sure that I wasn't making the decision as a lashing out to my dad and that I was being level headed. Especially being after the parents split me and dad didn't talk for years after an explosive argument.

Now that we had been talking for about 6 months maybe more, he's very upset I've changed my name and takes it as a personal attack and even blames mum for turning us kids against him (he did that himself tbh).

So reddit, am I the asshole here? I kind of feel like there was no good way to go about the change

"So there’s a student that started working at my workplace and after having some lunches with a mutual co-worker, they found out that the student lives close to me. The student doesn’t drive (no car, no license) and at the time relied on her mother to get her to and from work. The co-worker suggested that maybe the student and I carpool and while I wasn’t initially keen on the idea, I figured it was a good way to make a little extra money.

The arrangement has been ongoing for a month or so now but I can’t help but be annoyed by her poor manners and entitled personality. What bothers me the most is how she doesn’t even say something as simple as “thank you” or just anything to show that she’s appreciative of the whole arrangement. I want to continue to show kindness towards her as I know how much painful it can be to take public transit to work (driving would only take 20 minutes whereas the bus would take 1.5 hours). But at the same time, I can’t stand the feeling of being under-appreciated.

"I'm getting married in August. I love my fiancé but my future MIL has the most ""powerful"" personality I've ever encountered and had essentially planned (and to be fair, paid for) the entire wedding. We are getting married at her golf/tennis club in Scottsdale and the numbers she's putting forward are making my head spin because I'm thinking we could buy a house for what she's spending. My wedding is not at all what I wanted but that ship has sailed a long time ago I guess. 

I've lived in Scottsdale my entire life and even went to school in AZ so I have to say up front I don't have a lot of friends other than white people, so I'm probably not very ""woke."" But my first dorm roommate was an African-American girl from the middle of Alabama and we've stayed friends. Last year I went to her wedding and her grandma and aunt catered her wedding with traditional southern soul food and it was maybe the most delicious food I've ever eaten. I always wanted to incorporate somthing similar into my own wedding.

Since I didn't get to pick the food for the wedding since the club is catering, I've pretty much put my foot down that the rehearsal will have soul food. I've found a home soul food catering business and their food is so good and they are happy to cater the dinner. My future sister-in-law is now saying that I'm being culturally insensitive and inappropriatly appropriating my friends culture for my ""100% wypipo"" wedding. She also says that I just don't get it because I've never left AZ and she has a degree from Columbia. 

My mother in law is taking her side of course because she just wants fo have the rehearsal at the club anyways. I want to put my foot down but for the right reasons if that makes sense.

Am I the asshole for wanting fo have soul food at my wedding rehearsal dinner?

Edit: I came here looking for answers on one topic and may have had my eyes opened to another major problem (future husband being so deferential and involved with his mom).

Edit2: I tried to talk with my fiancé many of the legit concerns you guys brought out. He stormed out of my apartment, presumably to his parents house since his mom has called me 38 times and texted me easily 50 ""demanding"" to know what is going on.

c5p9oe	2019-06-26 12:33:39	lostnybrother	AITA for trying to contact my half brother who didn’t know I existed after I was given his contact details by his mom?	"Growing up I never saw my dad. He was there for birthdays and Christmases but long story short, he had another family (wife + son) that I had NO idea about until I was around 14. When my mom sat me down and explained she’d fucking lived a lie for my entire live oviously it was traumatic and horrible for me. I was 14 and kinda latched onto the idea that my brother was in the same boat as me. I really love both my mom and my dad but part of me is just disgusted with them both. 

I recently met my dads wife and the mom of my brother at their home. She was very kind, and told me that I couldn’t help the circumstance of my birth and that she always encouraged my dad to be there for me AND my mom as soon as she found out about my conception.  She explained that oviously she wasn’t happy about it but due to circumstances she could understand my dads need to provide for me. 

They provided me with my brothers contact details (he’s a couple years older than me) and told me to text him. They thought an explanation would be better from me as an ‘innocent’ party and then he could go to them if he had questions. I did, I called him and told him I couldn’t believe I was able to finally talk to him after years of dreaming about meeting my sibling, and told him that I really really wanted to be in his life. 

He reacted extremely negatively and blocked me. He went so far as to MOVE APARTMENT (which is a massive deal... like. He’s 23 or 24. I’m 18. How the eff can he afford to move and break a lease so easily??) to avoid his parents and myself. 

At this point I’m heartbroken. I just want a family member who didn’t intentionally sabotage my existence, like my mom and freaking dad did, I just want my sibling. 

I keep trying to FB message him, snapchat, I tried to google his gf and found her LinkedIn to see if she would be willing to let me speak with him via her. He just won’t reply. 

I recently googled his name again and found his name listed under a garage where he is a mechanic. My dad thinks I should show up and try talk to him. WIBTA if I did this?"	Asshole	0	0

I was not raised around him because he is significantly older than me, and stayed in another state for college. I see him about once a year during the holidays.
Four years ago when I was 14 I got into an argument with our physically abusive mother in front of him. He didn't like what I said to her, and said I was disturbing etc for years after that(I honestly don't remember what I said, but it was in the peak of me being rude, so I assume it was bad). He confiscated a Christmas gift that was given to me by someone that was not him because I ""didn't deserve it for being so rude."" I continued to argue with him every time that I saw him until I was 16 (because I started ignoring him). My mother has consistently stirred up a fuss because she thinks that if he comes to visit us, I should be talking to him for whatever reason. Despite us being siblings, I personally do not see the point in talking to him. I have rejected gifts that he has tried to present in an attempt to make up with me.
I am an adult now, and my mother keeps saying that I should talk to him etc. I ignore his phone calls (which happen occasionally if my mother will not answer her phone). Recently there is some sort of sports thing he's competing in, and my parents are talking about switching the family vacation to watching him compete. I would honestly rather go to work.

c5p1ca	2019-06-26 12:09:04	aggressixe	AITA for being upset over my best friends opportunity for a free holiday?	"Apologies in advance for the long post but I need to provide some context - I am from Australia, names have been changed.

My best friend, Anna and I (both 19f) have been friends for a while, last year I moved to another state to study for 12 months, and I recently moved back home.

Her friend Charlie dislikes me because I was close friends with Anna. To give context Charlie is a 24/25f with a long history of alcohol and drug abuse.

Once moving back home Anna and Charlie both began to get more involved in drugs and drinking I began to distance myself. The two of them met a man Adam (45m) on a night out, and him and Charlie soon started dating. Adam, this 45 year old man, encouraged both Anna and Charlie to take drugs, providing it for free.

I expressed my worry to Anna, explaining how odd the situation is and how a 19f shouldn’t be accepting free drugs and alcohol from a man old enough to be her father. She thanked me for the concern but remained friends with them, often choosing their company over my attempts to invite her out with different groups.

My graduation, was in another state, we were going for a couple of days to make a holiday out of it. Anna had decided to come to my graduation to support me, purchasing her own plane tickets and organising a place to stay. Fast forward to the night before we were supposed to leave and I get a phone call from Anna. She explains how Adam is currently in Mexico with some friends, and has offered to pay in full for Anna and Charlie to come and meet him in Mexico and then fly to LA for a week.   
 I told Anna that although it sounded exciting I had some reservations about the plan:

1. Anna did not have much money and would be relying on Adam to support her.
2. She would have to take more time off of work, and would struggle with rent, bills etc.

She disagreed and I decided to leave it as we were going away tomorrow and didn’t want any issues. About half an hour later she calls me again and simply states that she’s not going to my graduation. 

Basically the two trips clashed and she decided she would prefer to go to Mexico for free than my graduation. I was of course extremely upset and was in tears, she apologised and I ended up telling her I needed some time, she had offered to look at different flights so she could do both trips and we ended the conversation with me saying if she wanted to make the time for me I wanted her to come, otherwise I would talk to her when I was back from my graduation so we could discuss things.

Days passed, and I didn’t hear a word from Anna, I had my graduation, posted photos online when I realised she had blocked me on most social media platforms. I then received a text the day after my graduation, while still away, stating that I was a toxic person, and that she had outgrown our friendship, words I can guarantee came from Charlie’s mouth.

The title says it all. My partner was catfished before I met him. He met a beautiful blonde girl online and fell in love with not only her looks but her personality. He received many pictures of this person including nude photos with faces, so he had 100% reason to believe it was real. 

They did the typical catfish behaviour of organising to meet up at a certain place, saying they were running late than bailing completely. Being young, lonely and hopeful, my partner proceeded to continue to try and meet this person. It never happened. Three years after the first communication with this profile they admitted to him that it wasn’t their true self.

My partner was devastated. He had never had a partner before and believed this was the person for him. He blocked all of her accounts, numbers and ways of communicating him, before getting his number changed. She had sent him a photo of herself, so he later saw that she was then stalking his Facebook profile which she never had before, from her real account. He reactivated accounts like Kik and there were so many messages you couldn’t see them all. 

He never spoke to her again. He hated what she caused him and he didn’t want to bother with the stress. We met a year later, and have been together for 5 years. Around three months ago, this girl, her boyfriend and a previous friend of my partners decided to sit outside my partners house, screaming his name and speeding off like teenagers when anyone came out. 

My partner broke down crying while angry and said he hasn’t spoken to her, she hurt him in a way that has caused him major confidence, trust and mental health issues. He hasn’t been the same since, he wasn’t able to feel love the way he did before and he still doesn’t believe he ever will, because he hasn’t been able to feel it with me, but he admits he would stay with me for the rest of his life, have a family and grow old with me. But he will always have trust issues. About a lot of things now, which has put a major strain on our relationship. 

So, WIBTA, if I catfished this girl for an EXTREMELY SHORT period of time, around 2-4 weeks before telling her exactly who I am, and asking her how it feels. I don’t want to put her down in anyway. I just want to exploit her trust. I have no one to tell her secrets too if she admits them to the fake profile, I just want her to know how it feels to believe someone and to have the feeling of distrust."	Asshole	1	0

My mom struggles to keep employees and often relies on us, her 7 kids to work, but only 4 of us (including me) are able to for various reasons. So she said theyll be stretched thin the time her bf is gone. Thing is since i moved i started my own business doing lash extensions. Now i have appts pretty much everyday and service 2-3 clients daily from home. W 6-8 hours of work i make 150-320 a day. i dont want to leave that to be bored for 9 hours just to babysit her clients. she’ll pay me 12/hr to make up for tolls but thats only 108. plus ill have to get up around 6:30 to get ready and leave by 7am to be there. When i get home, i wont have time/energy to cook for me and my bf. Im already working for her this Sat. & the next one so ill already be inconvenienced then, & now she wants me to work more. she doesnt get that its little things that add up & make me not want to help.

My moms business is lucrative. she gets abt 4-7k a month for a client and has 7-8 rn. of course thats before expenses and her employees pay, but still. im not okay w sacrificing my business & helping hers while only making 100$ a day when shes makes that. its not worth my effort & its not worth what it takes away from my boyfriends and I’s life. Another thing is my mom just paid off my brothers car (4k dollars). Im the 6/7 child & the only one who supports myself entirely financially & every way. (oldest sibling is 27 and youngest is 17.) she gives my other siblings money sometimes & i never get. not that im entitled to it but im the only kid supporting myself, only one who doesnt get help from her & now i have to put a pause on my business to go help out at HERS which benefits everybody except me. i know shes my mother & that she needs help but im so conflicted on what to do.

Another thing is that my mom has a habit of manipulating me. last time i help her out she said she didnt have workers & when i went to work i found out she was just athome. she does have lots of paperwork to do but i think shes being irrational. i tell her just do the paperwork at the group home while she works & for some reason that doesnt work for her (environments not the same). but to me as the ONLY business owner if you have no employees its YOUR responsibility to go to work.

Oh & w group homes an employee has to be there 24/7. One of them requires 2 employees 24/7, the other only requires 1.

So WIBTA if i tell her that i dont want to help out more early July?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

So about 3 months ago I received a ban here for being ""uncivil."" what led to this was as followed.There was a discussion about someone having their dietary restrictions catered to. I am going to leave this vague as I don't want the post to be found and brigaded. (even though it will be very easy to do so given my lack of post history).

&#x200B;

one of my comments was:

""Vegetarians have a dietary restriction that says they cannot eat meat. Meat eaters do not have any restriction that forces them to only eat meat.

Edit: Lmao at people crying because this poor boy doesn't have his family make him meat.""

&#x200B;

Someone responds:  
""Do me a favor. Go get injured. Need family assistance. Have dipshits like yourself jeer and sneer cus they are too caught up in a who is more self righteous battle and telling your it’s in you to go provide even though you need help. Classic Reddit high horse.

She isn’t injured. She could cook her own meals. Oh but no it’s all on OP. He’s the new one so fuck his injury being the only reason he’s there. That doesn’t matter at all to people like you. Just the troll posts about the moral high horse you believe you own.""  


I reply back:

""Wow you're a prick. Blocked.""

&#x200B;

I receive a message shortly after saying I am banned for a month for being uncivil. Apparently because my message was gendered and uncivil. Now I went with it initially because I didn't want to be perma-banned because at the time I used reddit quite a bit but its been a month since my last post so I kinda want to know how the court of public opinion judges me here."		1	0
c5oya0	2019-06-26 12:00:24	burger_licker	AITA for leaving my girlfriend alone after her crazy house mate called the police because she doesn't like having men in the house.	"So yesterday I'd been out for a pub quiz and we decided to stay at my girlfriends place as it was closer. I've stayed there before but only once. We're both pretty exhausted and just say hi to the dogs and go to bed. 

After a few minutes there's a knock on the door. Its her housemate. She says that she feels uncomfortable with men in the house and that she needs at least 24 hours notice to allow it and that she's told the landlord this. No one has ever said anything even the last time I was there when she was also in. She proceedes to say that it's ok now but in the future she'd prefer it so we both remain in bed. 

Another knock on the door and its her saying she's just had a panic attack and called the police and that she's said she doesn't want men in the flat and I have to leave. 

This woman is usually verbally abusive and generally unpleasant and is always walking around the house shouting things. She also takes my girlfriends dogs out without permission which I don't feel like it's ok and one of them was out of the room with a limp so who knows what happened there.

Anyway, I eventually left as I was concerned that my presence would just make things worse and that I wanted to respect her right to not have men in the house. On the other hand I was genuinely concerned for my girlfriends life as this lady is for sure mentally unwell and aggressive.

c5oxq7	2019-06-26 11:58:44		AITA for ending a longterm friendship over a FREE holiday?	"Apologies in advance for the long post but I need to provide some context! I am from Australia, names have been changed.

My best friend, Anna and I (both 19f) have been friends for a while, last year I moved to another state to study for 12 months, and I recently moved back home.

Her friend Charlie dislikes me because I was close friends with Anna. To give context Charlie is a 24/25f with a long history of alcohol and drug abuse.

Once moving back home Anna and Charlie both began to get more involved in drugs and drinking I began to distance myself. The two of them met a man Adam (45m) on a night out, and him and Charlie soon started dating. Adam, this 45 year old man, encouraged both Anna and Charlie to take drugs, providing it for free.

I expressed my worry to Anna, explaining how odd the situation is and how a 19f shouldn’t be accepting free drugs and alcohol from a man old enough to be her father. She thanked me for the concern but remained friends with them, often choosing their company over my attempts to invite her out with different groups.

My graduation, was in another state, we were going for a couple of days to make a holiday out of it. Anna had decided to come to my graduation to support me, purchasing her own plane tickets and organising a place to stay. Fast forward to the night before we were supposed to leave and I get a phone call from Anna. She explains how Adam is currently in Mexico with some friends, and has offered to pay in full for Anna and Charlie to come and meet him in Mexico and then fly to LA for a week.   
 I told Anna that although it sounded exciting I had some reservations about the plan:

1. Anna did not have much money and would be relying on Adam to support her.
2. She would have to take more time off of work, and would struggle with rent, bills etc.

She disagreed and I decided to leave it as we were going away tomorrow and didn’t want any issues. About half an hour later she calls me again and simply states that she’s not going to my graduation. 

Basically the two trips clashed and she decided she would prefer to go to Mexico for free than my graduation. I was of course extremely upset and was in tears, She apologised and I ended up telling her I needed some time, she had offered to look at different flights so she could do both trips and we ended the conversation with me saying if she wanted to make the time for me I wanted her to come, otherwise I would talk to her when I was back from my graduation so we could discuss things.

Days passed, and I didn’t hear a word from Anna, I had my graduation, posted photos online when I realised she had blocked me on most social media platforms. I then received a text the day after my graduation, while still away, stating that I was a toxic person, and that she had outgrown our friendship, words I can guarantee came from Charlie’s mouth.

This all happened a few weeks ago, but it has bothered me greatly, AITA for not being more supportive of her choices and being upset?"		1	0

I have this friend. Since about 2 months ago she's been ""eager"" to see me since our schedule really doesn't match so normally once a month is already a gift. But due to fasting and other things, I couldn't find time to meet her, be it with other friends or just the two of us. 

After ramadan I tried really hard to make it up to her. There's been 3/4 times where we can actually meet, but god just has to have other plans. Yesterday was another plan. Should have been three of us, but the other one couldn't make it. She asked whether it should be just the two of us, I said the ball's on her court. 12 pm I asked, if she's game I'll prepare and even pick her up, which is about 40 mins by bike / an hour by car through a really crowded road. She said she's not ready yet. I said okay, tell me when you're ready. The answer never came.

Today I was fortunate to get another free time, so I asked her again. She's gonna ask the other friend from yesterday. I luckily caught him online on steam and invite him. He said he's in office, probably unavailable till early july. So I came back to her with his answer since he said he hasn't reply her yet. Again, I offered the take it or leave it. And again, radio silence.

I wouldn't mind if she straight up said no to only the two of us, even if she was the one that comes up with the idea. It's the no reply that makes me give up. I think I've had enough, and don't know what to say when she comes up with another arrangement. You might say I overreact too much, but I was postponing hanging out with my cousin yesterday so I can have the time, and the fortunate thing that happen today was my cousin going back to her home earlier than planned, so the plan with her is crossed out.

They're mostly huge men, and I'm a 16 year old girl and don't want confrontation from them. They're also really weird, when they first moved next door they would watch me, my siblings and cousins play on our trampoline. They don't do that anymore, but I'm still freaked out by them. 

My grandpa is nice to them. My grandpa gives them presents like my old bike and a desk, since they have young kids. It's a terraced neighbourhood so it's really awkward when the adults (men) are out, I just go inside when they come out. They play loud music sometimes, like right now, and I just want it to stop because I can hear everything. Currently they are playing the song 'selfie'. Kill me now!!

I've just learnt what a Bluetooth is and am wondering if I should connect to their TV and play a strange song. Should I? Or should I make my grandpa talk to them? I don't wanna make things awkward, since we'll see them in their garden sometimes.

c5oomu	2019-06-26 11:29:34	throwdowntown69	AITA for insinuating that my friend is a slut?	"I have a friend let's call her Anna. She really strongly the relationship-type but she has had a past time as a single person and had casual sex.

Sometimes when we grab a coffee or go out clubbing she sees guys hitting on women. And she clearly shows contempt towards their behavior (she is not the one being hit on though, just a spectator).

So everytime she sees a situation like that she says that those guys idiots and she can't understand how they like that way of living. Anna believes that all those guys will be unhappy someday because they will never be able to transition into a relationship.

I have heard that often enough so recently I kind of snapped. I know of her past; she has had a few hook ups where she met with guys just to fuck. Unfortunately every one of them was an asshole in some kind of way (mostly by lying about important things) which is part of the reason she doesn't like single guys.

After the last rant of hers I simply told her: ""Maybe those guys wouldn't succeed all the time fucking these sluts if people like you wouldn't give them the opportunity by spreading your legs!""

I can't really tell how she took that because she didn't really react to my words but we quickly moved on and didn't talk about it.

So now I am conflicted if I am the asshole for pointing that out. On one hand it's her prerogative to make mistakes and learn from them on the other hand she has had multiple guys even after some of them were assholes to her.

c5olf7	2019-06-26 11:19:00	rollique	AITA for wanting to leave my job	"I work on the metrology department at an automotive plant. My job mainly requires me to check some gauges and some test parts that are used to check if the assembly machines are ok. It's kinda simple and boring, and I do this for over a year already. Since I first got here, I was promised I'd get an engineer job (I' just finished automatics engineering) and I was hoping I'd get a little bit more complex tasks to do. Recently I complained about this and I asked to have a litlle more work given to me. I had a meeting with the whole team only for them to conclude that I am not proactive enough and It's my fault because I do not insist enough to get more work. I woul've done that, if I'd have a bigger salary (the company keeps giving me only 6/12 months contract with a salary that is the smallest from anyone I know here). I do not feel like I'm needed enough here and that they are only promising me stuff so I don't leave, in order for them to not have to do the stupid work that I do. I tried to be more proactive and tried to help my other teammates (both engineers) and only got ignored or talked like shit. One of them is older (also the one that coordinates us) and makes fun of me since the first day here. I decided that I want to interact with them as little as possible.

I want so much to leave this place and never return, especially because nobody listens to me, I did not get any raise or a normal contract, and this things stop me from making a small loan to be able to buy some stuff that I really need, and can't afford with cash. I don't have any other job opportunity yet, but I only want to see myself gone from here. I'll admit that I'm not the best employee, since I get lazy when I have nothing to do, I don't ask for something to do, and I do some of my personal stuff at work sometimes.

My only fear is that it's my fault for not trying enough to learn new things and to convince my teammates to teach me. I'm afraid that I'm too lazy and I'm not involved enough for me to have bigger challanges."	No A-holes here	0	0

Like I said, I usually find it flattering to me. Even when girls who are 10s approach him. But this one bothered me for some strange reason... she’s no physically a threat to me. I personally am told often I’m a 10 and she is very pretty but 20 years his senior. But, after my husband introduced me to her as his wife he introduced me to her to me as his 7th grade teacher (which she was) but the strangest response came from her...  she almost got embarrassed, offended, and defensive. She said “NO, please do not introduce me as your 7th grade teacher. Oh no don’t say that” and she kept bringing it up like “7th grade teacher?! No, please don’t say that! That makes me feel so old”  but kept repeating this at least 3-4 times. I don’t understand why should would not want him to say he was in her 7th grade class if he most definitely was?? As she left she said... “you really got a crazy one here” as I type this I’m laughing because I swear these weird situations only happen to me and I’m sure most people will think I should just brush it off... but I have the weirdest intuition and I’m feeling there’s more here than what appears?		1	0

M for Mom
S1 for Sibling1
S2 for Sibling2
S3 for Sibling3

So, I know I sound really idiotic, but hear me out. I live in a house with 4 other people and they make a large mess ALL the time. It's come to a point where eldest (S1) uses the excuse of going to work as a free right to leave chip packets on the living room table and be mad when I don't clean it up. I'm the youngest by the way. M is just running errands a lot of the time so she is out of the question but she has no problems and I don't mind doing the house work for her. S2 is aggressive towards me when I mention housework, she says I never clean so I should do it for once. Now I have 2 points against this. 1. I almost never clean because I make little to no mess and when I do I always pick it up because I'm afraid of what they'll say and 2. They have been using this excuse for a couple months now, so if I never clean the house, how is it that I'm always cleaning for these last few months? Also, when I approached S2 about this, she said fine, clean whatever you do, I thought it would be fine, but I quickly realised she meant wherever I step I have to hoover and that sort of thing, which would again end up making me clean the whole house again. S3 is by far the worst. She is 1 year older than me but talks down upon me like I'm twelve years younger. Whenever house work comes up, she is quick to leave by saying 'I always do it' and then go to her friend's house. She always gives me commands when she is about to leave saying 'maybe you can tidy the house for once' in a tone and facial expression of 'if you don't, I'll make I big deal out of this and get you into trouble.' It frustrates me as I can do nothing about it and I would like to know if I would be TA if refuses to do their dirty work.

Since he's been with her he has changed from being nice to being a constant asshole.

I still haven't texted back since I don't know what to say besides that I hate her and she ruined my brother.

&#x200B;

I also don't know why she texted me now, I mean we never ever text each other. It may have to do with the fact that I asked my brother when they were going to a festival so I could come home and feed the cat, he texted (which he deleted) that he did not want me home this weekend (the text was a lot more hurtful in Dutch) after the deleted text I got a text that he and my SIL would be home all Saturday and didn't want me there and that they would be home late on Sunday (so I guess they will feed the cat if they don't want me to come home)

Now luckily I only drink like twice a year and I started this after my birthday, so I didn't drink while on it but if it was someone else it could have gone badly. 

I stopped this medication for a while and went back on it, and they just haven't bothered to put the warning on it at all. 

A few months ago I started another new medication, and when I picked up the refill last week there was a warning on it that it may cause drowsiness and to be careful when using heavy machinery, and that alcohol and marijuana make it worse. 

And again, luckily I didn't feel drowsy on it but I've been using heavy machinery at work and I feel like if it's important enough to get a big red warning I should have known about it right away. 

I don't want to switch pharmacies because this is the easiest one to get to and the cheapest, plus if they're doing this to other people eventually someone's going to get hurt, but I still feel like an ass for complaining about something that doesn't actually affect me.

Edit: the pharmacist doesn't give info packets when I start a new medication. He specifically told me doesn't because the side effects scare people. Some people here have pointed out that that's likely illegal so regardless of opinion I'm reporting him for that.

I also told him that I wanted her to be my friend, that I liked her and I feel understood by her to the point that I started to cry. Please keep in mind that I have depression and take anti-depressants. Also, I do not feel at ease with my current friends and wish to have someone to share my secrets and such. 
We where in a public space and told me to get the fuck out of there. 

Anyway we made peace today, but do you think that i should insist on the matter or i am an asshole and i should give up my request?"	Asshole	0	0
c5oay2	2019-06-26 10:44:29	Ambartah	WIBTA if I un-invited my fiancé’s friend, and his fiancée, from my wedding?	"I’ll try and cover the basics, I know I’m probably the arsehole, but here goes.

Some back story that makes me feel like I’m being the arsehole and this is just the straw that broke the camel’s back is as follows: FH’s best man (not the friend I’m referring to in the title, but we’ll get there) only bought his now-fiancée a ring because my FH bought me one. Best Man then deliberately proposed to his now-fiancée before FH proposed to me. Whatever, I’m happy, they’re happy, we’re all friends. We’re all getting married next year within 3 months of each other. No problem, everyone is happy. I have no right to be pissed off, so I’ve kept it to myself, even though I am a little peeved. (Sue me 🤷🏼‍♀️)

Then my proposal’s story, the relevant stuff anyway. FH popped the Q, we told the family, and then he told his friends. One of which is the titular Friend. He said his congratulations, no problems so far! He then messaged FH later complaining that his gf was losing it because we got engaged first... actually sobbing over it. Right okay I’m a tad concerned you’re gonna cause a scene at our wedding but sure, let’s slam her straight on that guest list.

So cut forward to Monday, FH drops me a message saying his friend had proposed to the weepy woman. Or at least he assumes he did, he woke up from being drunk and there she is wearing a ring 🤷🏼‍♀️ sure. They’re now planning to get married this year. I think what pisses me off, more than the fact I know she is doing this deliberately, is that all he does is complain about her. Why have you proposed man? Is it just to shut her up?!

But yeah, tl;dr WIBTA if I un-invited my FH’s friend and fiancée from the wedding because I don’t trust her not to cause a scene after she has decided to get married before me because she’s bitter I’m getting married. 

Any questions? 🤣

Edit to add: My fiancé doesn't like this woman, and agrees with me that he doesn't want her there. Also I would not just be straigh up un-inviting them without speaking to my fiancé first.

Edit to add 2: I know my writing is hard to follow but Best Man and Friend are 2 separate guys so it’s 2 different engagements."	Asshole	0	0
c5oaku	2019-06-26 10:43:17		WIBTA for not giving my cousin my number?	"My cousin (I think he’s 9) comes over every other weekend to see my uncle, as he does not have custody of him right now (family drama). My cousin comes over to play games and he recently brought up the idea I should give him my number so he could text me. I haven’t really given him a response for a few reasons. 

1. He’s annoying. Yes it sounds harsh but I really don’t like kids at all.

2. I don’t want him syncing his contacts with Instagram or Snapchat. I’ll explain more in a bit

3. I don’t want him constantly messaging me.


Well start with #1. He constantly asks for this CoD game I have since I don’t play it anymore. I told him he could have it if my friend didn’t find it interesting (I planned on giving it to a friend if he liked it). Since then he’s been asking if my friend liked it or not (he would ask this many times a day) and I told him he hasn’t come over to play it. My friend plays baseball and asking him to come over to play games is hard because he trains for baseball.

#2. My mum used to dictate my social media accounts. She’d tell me what and what not to post and I hated that. I made a new account and blocked all of my contacts. I don’t want them seeing that account, and I don’t want my friends to see my account either. Not ashamed of it, I just don’t want them seeing it.

3#. This kid constantly talks to me everyday when he’s over. I hate it. Now I can’t say anything because I’m shy and I don’t like confronting people, but if he gets my number then I’m afraid he’ll try to talk to me everyday. I rarely talk to anyone.

Now I know he’ll try to ask me in front of his dad or my parents to try and get me to say yes (he does this often) but I don’t know if I’d be the asshole for not giving them my number."	No A-holes here	1	0
c5o9xt	2019-06-26 10:41:10	Hilothrow	AITA for wanting to go on a trip?	"Here’s the context. I’m a college student with incredibly generous parents, who are paying the cost of my tuition. I’m contributing about 10,000 over the course of four years, and paying my non-tuition/room expenses. 

I’ve always had a job since I was sixteen, sometimes two, and spent very little money. This has resulted in me having a really large savings account for someone my age. I’m able to afford what my parents are asking from me, with quite a bit leftover. As I said, I haven’t spent much, and I really haven’t had anything I wanted to spend money on. 

Two days ago, though, I found out my favorite band of all time is touring in Europe. I’ve always wanted to go to Europe, have never been, and I suspect this may be their last tour/album. I love them and I thought I would finally spend some of my money to go see them. The day after, I got my financial aid info from my school. It was slightly less than last year. I told my parents about it and the trip at the same time (possibly a mistake), and they were not very happy. They told me that they were giving up a lot so that I could graduate debt free, and I don’t deny that at all. Basically, they kind of shamed me for wanting to have fun, when they have cut back on said fun to pay for my tuition. I honestly had no response; they’re right, and I’m so grateful for what they’re giving me. But at the same time- I’ve been working for a large chunk of my life so that when an opportunity like this comes up, I can take it. Now that it’s here, I feel like an asshole for wanting to go. AITA? 

Edit- I didn’t lose a scholarship or anything- tuition just went up. The trip is about what it went up by. 

TL;DR- my parents pay my tuition with some help from me. I want to go on a trip. They think it’s selfish. AITA?"	Not enough info	0	0
c5o954	2019-06-26 10:38:20		WIBTA if I drop off the face of the Earth to find out what I want from my life??	"Okay some context, I'm 18 and in grade 12 currently and so at the end if the year I'll be done with school ( I don't plan on going to university) 
I have no clue what I want to do with my life and so I've decided to join the ADF (Australian Defense Force) for a gap year program where im only obligated to stay with the ADF for a year and then can decide if I want to stay or leave once the year is up and I feel like I'd definitely want to stay for longer, I'd have to leave my city and travel to a different state for training and all that. 

My friend group from this year are some of the best people I have ever met, they're so inclusive and I've never felt like I belonged in any friendship group until I found these guys, they've honestly made the last year and I'm sure the rest of this year the absolute best I've ever had.

My issue is that I don't think that I can handle saying goodbye to everyone, I can't tell people because Its all going to be too hard on me and I'm not going to want to leave everyone even though I know everyone will be supportive, just the fact of having to say goodbye I believe is going to be too hard. I appreciate them all so much but the thing is that I basically want a fresh start, I want to discover what I want from life while having nothing and noone holding me back. 

My current plan is to get everyone really personalised gifts that represent all our inside jokes and good times I've had with each of them, I'd write a small note for each of them and tell them all how much they all mean to me and how much I'll miss them but that I just can't handle the proper goodbye, that I'm sure I'll see them in the future but I dont know when that would be.

I would also have to deactivate all my social media and change my phone number because if I see them trying to contact me I'll cave.

"For the better part of most of my life, i've been pushed around, stepped all over, bullied, and just generally treated like shit. There have only been a handfull of people who havent been complete assholes to me. I recently just moved towns and i dont have any friends here just yet. I still have all of my friends from my prior city, although. Lately i've been getting fed up with all this mistreating from nearly everyone in my life, so i've sort of made a policy for myself: cut out anyone and everyone who is negative for me. Since none of my friends live near enough to see me irl at all, its pretty easy to block them out. I've gotten rid of some pretty important people, and they almost all take it as me being an asshole, in turn, we end on negative terms. I dont tell them off or anything, i just tell them what they've done, and block them shortly after.

c5o2yn	2019-06-26 10:16:39	spoookyhooky	AITA for being irritated at my best friend constant antics	"So long story short, me and my best friend have known each other for a long time, went through some bad times together and stuff. 

However not to long ago after a resent break-up with her ex she started dating a new guy. From what I understood he was a easy to anger guy who'd make my friend feel unwanted, which made me dislike him almost immediately. After meeting him I realized the guy was actually very nice and polite and my view on him has changed. My view on my best friend however has also changed to someone who's now really needy and gets easily upset over fairly meaningless things on a daily basis. 

For the most part I've been the supportive friend who sides with her but sympathise for the guy too. I try to understand for their position not my own, how they feel. What pisses me off is the fact I feel like I'm the back up plan. Whenever I offer to do something that might help her (like time away from the boyfriend/advise/support ) if they haven't had a fight that day (which is a very rare thing) she go at first but then after a while she'll change her mind to be with her boyfriend. I only seem to be remembered when she has to complain. 

This week I ask if she wanted to go to an event with me, she said yes until she saw the prices (about £15) which I know she can afford since she's spent wayy more on a afternoon trip, next month she's spending most of her time and money with her boyfriend, so she'll need all her money for that. I was a little annoyed but nothing I can't handle. 

Buttt my friend can apparently spend money on a train to get booze and get drunk with some of our mutual friends.

Maybe I'm just jealous, getting irritated over something small but it's been happening for a while now. I feel as if my friend has changed to somebody I don't know. Hopefully I'll calm down by the end of the week.

A lot of the times some of them speak English and others in the group don't. Someone in the group will usually just approach me with English and translate for everyone and I'll roll with it, but if they have others in their group speaking Spanish, I'll ask them in Spanish if they prefer Spanish. If they say yes, I just say one moment and switch groups with my Latino co-workers and have them take over. But if it's busy or we just have English speakers on shift,  I'll try to use my basic ass Spanish with the adults or the kids if they're clearly speaking mostly Spanish, even though I could just use the person in the group speaking English. I basically just know how to say the flavors and do you want a cup or cone. Am I being rude to switch to my basic white ass Spanish?  Should I just let the English speaker in the group take over if there is one? Sometimes it's clear nobody in the group speaks English, so I'll stumble my way through in those cases. Thoughts?

c5o0ky	2019-06-26 10:08:32	merk35802	AITA for ruining my nephew's wedding ceremony?	"My nephew got married at a beautiful resort. The ceremony was outdoors on a beach. My wife and her sister took their parents to get seated early because they are old (80 and 82) and not in great shape. I stayed up at the club house for 10 minutes. I didn't know that it was a long walk down a winding, sandy path to the beach. I later learned that my sister in-law didn't bring my father in-law's walker or O2 and the trek was very hard for them.

Plastic folding chairs were arranged on the sand in a traditional wedding set up. We had reserved seating in the second row of the groom's side.  My FIL was seated on the center aisle, my MIL next, then my wife. I took the empty seat next to my wife a few minutes before the ceremony. I noticed that all three looked exhausted and we're sweating.

As the bridal party began to come down the aisle, my wife told me to be ready to help her father stand up. As soon as the officiant said to stand for the bride, I planned to shimmy passed my wife and MIL. But my FIL began standing before I got there and wobbled like he might fall, so I moved quick to grab him under the arms. I too became unbalanced and swayed just slightly into my MIL. She lost her balance on the sand and stumbled into my leg stretched awkwardly in front of her. She fell forward, crashing through the front row of chairs for the groom's immediate family and wedding party.

All of this created a huge commotion, people gasped and gawked, and those closest rushed in to help. Meanwhile the bride's father paused her walk down the aisle while we got my MIL onto her feet and reset the chairs. 

MIL wasn't hurt, thankfully, but she was terribly embarrassed and pretty much apologized all night to everyone at the reception. A few jokes about the incident made it into the best man's speech. The bride and groom were outwardly good natured, but my wife told me she and her family were pretty bent.

My wife is blaming me. She said it was all my fault and IATA for ruining the ceremony. 

My position is that my SIL should have prepared better, brought the walker and O2. And the groom's parents - they should have warned about the unsteady terrain and long walk, maybe had some wheelchairs available. And my wife, since she knew I'd have to help FIL stand, should have saved me the seat right next to him. In short, they all set me up to fail.

So this afternoon, I was playing on my PS4 peacefully when my little brother(Age 10) plopped himself beside me and demanded me to let him have a go at the game I was playing. I somehow managed to bargain for another half an hour of play and told him that he could only use his controller and PSN(PlayStation Network) account. He agreed and watched me play for the next 30mins.

When my time was up. I did get up to let him play. However, my brother could not find his controller. He was disappointed, we even searched the house together but to no avail. He asked some people around the house but none recalled seeing it. He was angry and looked at me. He then proceeded to tell me to give him MY controller. I quickly said no.

Now, I have a special connection with my controller (It is my first console controller) and I absolutely do not trust my brother with it.  My brother, you see, didn't treat his controller well even before losing it. His controller was sort of oily and hard to use. This is something I dislike because it interferes with my play. 

My brother got angry started crying. Despite this however, I did not give in and did not let him get my controller. I offered to search for it again with him, which he firmly refuted. After that he went to the console and put it in rest mode. Tired, I gave up and went into my room, my controller still with me. 

Later, about 5 minutes or so, my maid came in and told me that it's 'better' for an older brother to listen to his younger siblings and give in to them. My answer didn't change. Still No.

He recently decided to be super eco-friendly and asks others to contribute too. I’m totally on board with him. However he’s a big smoker and litters it too, not my business, but I don’t think he’s aware of how bad it is for the environment. His worst enemy is plastic, and cigarette filters are the largest contaminate in the ocean rn.

If I were to get them, I’d leave a note like “I know you’re passionate about the environment and it’s amazing, not sure if this is overstepping boundaries but whether or not you have plans to quit, I know it doesn’t happen overnight. I thought you would enjoy this regardless.” I think it would be more helpful to him bc he’s either unaware, or aware but doesn’t know what options there are. 

The issue is 1)I’m not sure if this could be offensive for some reason and 2) His gf wants him to quit and it’s a dealbreaker for her. I used to be close with her but not anymore. She’s way more eco-friendly and is going zero waste, so you’d think she’d appreciate it, but she doesn’t understand quitting can be a long process, and could be furious at me for getting this and “enabling” him.

c5nyhu	2019-06-26 10:01:15		AITA for messaging my friends girlfriend (whom I have never met) because he keeps ignoring me?	"I (22m) am currently in a group chat with a few of my friends, one of whom let’s call Steven. I used to occasionally visit Stevens house and have met his parents quite a few times.

A few years ago, I decided to add Steven’s mum on Facebook, who I had met a few times in real life kind of as a joke. It turns out that Stevens mum got quite confused and decided to unfriend me a few months down the line.

A few weeks ago, Steven messages me in this group chat, pissed, saying that his dad was mad at me because I kept adding his mum on Facebook. I, having been at work all day, am very confused, and decide to send him a screenshot of Stevens Mums Facebook profile which says we are not friends. I inform Steven that it may have been a friend suggestion instead, and to let his parents it never happened. In this first attempt to let him know, he ignores my message and I decide to let it go. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and my other friends in the group ask if my issue ever got resolved. I say no, and ask Steven directly if he had told his parents yet. No response. At this point, I am starting to get annoyed, because I sometimes occasionally still meet his parents and I don’t want them thinking badly of me. A few weeks later, this topic arises again, and I message him again and ask him to tell his dad it was just misunderstanding. Finally, he responds and says that “who knows, all I know is I fucking got in trouble for this”, and tells me to “let it go”.

At this point, I am quite angry that I have been accused by my friend and his parents and he refuses to make things right, and on top of that, he seemed to be quite intent on not discussing this.

Now here is the part where I become the “asshole”. Instead of answering my questions, Steven is sending the group chat pictures of his chat with his girlfriend. I (being quite angry at this point) decide to get his attention by sending this screenshot to his girlfriend (whom I have never met before). He messages me and asks what my problem is. I tell him I’m sick of him ignoring me and I quite frankly just wanted an apology from him. He decides to ignore me and the group chat.

He has basically been ignoring the chat for the past month or so because I assume he is angry with me. Am I the Asshole?"		1	0
c5ny5m	2019-06-26 10:00:07		WIBTA for ghosting?	"This girl and I used to be really good friends. In April I’ve never been closer to anyone at any point in my life until one night. 

This one random Sunday night 2 months ago, we had a snapchat conversation she tells me she’s so grateful for me to be in her life. But then she starts telling me about how she gets bored of people after 3 years (I’ve known her for 2 1/2). Then she says she doesn’t know if she wants to keep talking when I leave for college (I’m going to college 3,000 miles away). I left her on opened and she immediately knew how pissed I was.

 I saw her that next day for maybe 30 seconds.  I was only giving one word answers to her questions and not even looking at her. 

That night, she snapchats me a long paragraph saying how she was “having a bad night” and doesn’t want to leave me on purpose. She also said it came out really wrong but she just has a hard time keeping up with people once she doesn’t see them frequently. 

I told her I forgave her because I convinced myself that I did, but 3 things happened at the end of May that convinced me she was going to stop talking to me in August. 

But now 2 months later, she still tries to talk to me a lot. 

This has been a big reason why I only talk to her once every week or so. I dodge her calls all the time, am almost never available to hang out, ignore her texts, and I do feel kinda bad about it for basing it off of one bad night she was having. 

But at the same time, if it’s not going anywhere, and that’s how she really feels at her lowest point, it’s time for me to move on. 

Also I have no regrets about ghosting in the few times I’ve had to do it. I know I have the mental strength to do it and not regret it, I just don’t know how to go about this."	Asshole	1	0
c5nxdz	2019-06-26 09:57:29	thrownaway25845375	WIBTA if I didn’t watch my brother’s girlfriend’s dogs while they’re on vacation?	"Throwaway since my brother browses Reddit often. 

I know the title sounds terrible, but hear me out. My brother and his girlfriend will be going on vacation in a few weeks and they had asked me if I could go over to the girlfriend’s house once a day to let the dogs out, feed them, walk them, etc. 

The reasons I have to object to going out there are because 1) she lives on a dangerous, winding road to drive at night, 2) I’ll be starting a new job with uncertain hours soon, and 3) I honestly just don’t feel comfortable with the situation in general. 

They told me I’m their only option and if I refused to care for her dogs for the week then she would not be able to go on vacation. I suggested putting them in a kennel or doggie daycare for the time being but the girlfriend thinks it’d be akin to “abandoning” the dogs plus she can’t afford to. 

I put my foot down after multiple attempts from my brother to guilt trip me about this and now both of them refuse to speak to me. I’m willing to compromise if it comes down to it.

This is honestly driving me nuts but I’d appreciate some objective opinions on this. WIBTA if I said no and ultimately put my brother’s girlfriend vacation with him in limbo?

EDIT: They would not be able to pay me and it would probably take me at least an hour to walk both of her dogs, feed them everyday, and then drive back into town to go to work. 15 minutes to drive out there, 15 minutes back home."	Not the A-hole	0	0

During the course of the relationship, I noticed a few signals here and there from B. At this point I’ve never dated, so I didn’t know how to interpret the situations thrown at me, so I didn’t think much of what was happening. B would invite me to movies and such, while it was upsetting A that I came with them.

After they dated for about 6 months, the relationship between them ended. It ended because A crossed a huge (and illegal) line, and didn’t realize what he had done wrong. This is about the time he becomes less of a friend to me.

A couple of **DAYS** later, we all 3 get invited to a work party. B gets super drunk. A had said that he wasn’t coming, because B and I were there. He ended up coming anyway. I comfort B while A is there because B didn’t to see him. B and I go to a different part of the house and B holds my hand and drunkenly admits that she likes me.

Having 0 idea how to process this, I talk to A on the way home from the party and he said “I don’t think she means it like that”.

Well, she meant it like that.

We ended up having a little thing for a few weeks on and off but we mutually ended it. I never told A, though he almost 100% knows because our work group was a gossip heaven.

I recently directed my first short film a few months ago, and my videographer asked me if they could edit  it together for a film credit and experience. I accepted, and we planned a post production timeline together with the producer, sound designer, and SFX editor, starting with the videographer’s portion.  If everything went according to plan,the film would have been fully edited in about a month and a half. It was made this way since I had a study abroad planned and we didn’t want to have to factor in a 11 hour time difference when planning to discuss revisions for cuts.

A week goes by and the videographer misses their first deadline, and they message me asking for an extension so they could study for finals. I’m a student too and I get finals are stressful, so I tell them to put it on the back burner for now, and just go after it once summer starts. Around this time I also get the videographer a production job, filling in for me while I’m abroad.

Summer comes and they miss their second deadline for the first cut. I message them again asking about it and they said that it’s just taking a little bit longer than expected and tell me to expect it in a few days. They miss the third deadline and don’t respond when I reach out. I contact my producer about it and he says he’ll look into it.

About a week passes and neither I, nor my producer have heard from them. At this point I assume that they ghosted the project and I have the producer find a new editor. About a full month has passed at this point, and I have to fly out, making the post-production cycle a lot harder. 

About a week in to my study abroad, my producer told me that he reached the videographer, who had told him they were struggling with mental health issues, which caused them to step away from the project.

Now I understand that it’s not their fault for struggling and I truly am glad that they stepped away and got the help they needed, but I still feel angry that they chose to leave the project without telling anybody, especially when the current state of production hinges on  them. Now, because they ghosted the project without telling anyone, the entire production cycle has become delayed and disorganized since people have flown back home and I’m in a different country, which makes communicating needed changes and revisions more difficult. I’m also worried about how they’re acting filling in for me as well, since I vouched for them to get the position over other candidates. 

When I voiced these complaints to the producer, he told me that we should be more worried about their mental well-being than anything else right now, but I still think I’m justified for being angry. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5npgn	2019-06-26 09:27:42	everythjngbagel	AITA for not wanting to attend my mother’s funeral?	"For some clarification my mother hasn’t died, but I’d give her only a few more years as she is incredibly unhealthy: paper thin, constantly hammered (literally from when she wakes up until she passes out drunk), on a million different medications; ranging from pain, to anxiety/depression, post cancer meds and more. She’s also just a down right angry woman,  never has anything nice to say about anyone or anything. 

I broke off contact with her a few years ago for a multitude of reasons. Most of them being from my childhood, and teen years, and some for just how she has been a vile mother to my sister. And a vile person (imo) in general. I can’t think of an single honest redeeming quality of this woman. 

An example of some of the emotional trauma she put me through as a teen was when she had cancer while I was in high school, I wasn’t handling it well, my grades slipped, I fell into a bout of depression and was trying to be there for my mother, and one night she and my stepdad at the time sat me down to talk about my failing grades and the result of the conversation was that, because I was doing poorly in school I was causing unnecessary stress on her which was making her cancer worse. They reiterated bluntly to me that I was the reason she was dying and if I didn’t shape up it would be my fault. 

That’s just one of the endless examples I have of her as my mother. When my sister and I sit together and talk about her we often argue (in good spirit) who had it worse from her. I think she was more cruel to my sister and my sister thinks she was more cruel to me. 

So I stepped away from my relationship with her and have been happier ever since. 

I know she has a will, I have no idea where I stand in said will, and if I am in it I have no interest in claiming whatever she could possibly want to leave me. (I’m also not entirely sure how that works) but if you ask me no amount of money or possessions from her can repair the horrible childhood I received.

Cut to now, the actual issue at hand. 

My brother and several of my other family members have recognized that she isn’t the healthiest and probably doesn’t have a terrible amount of time left and at a recent family gathering I mentioned that I had no interest in reconciliation and that I won’t be attending her funeral whenever that may be. 

This led to a severe amount of backlash from my family, mostly my brother. (they are all aware that she and I have a poor relationship) and they have all expressed that I am being selfish and owe her some respect for bringing me into this world, and in one way or another has made me the (somewhat successful) man I am today. And that I need to attend her funeral whenever that may be and I need to let go of pride. 

I disagree

c5nobw	2019-06-26 09:23:15	no-nova	AITA for refusing to eat fish??	"(*first post on reddit blah blah blah*) i am 17 and in high school. i live with my parents and i often refuse to eat a lot of food. the main reason why is due to my many allergies. even if i don't directly eat the ingredient in question but some other item in the same dish, it triggers allergic reactions. this is why many ingredients are banned in the household for to my safety.

&#x200B;

however, this includes common stuff that everyone loves. that's right: i'm allergic to potatoes among many things. crazy, right? i'm diagnosed so everyone in my family cannot eat potatoes as long as i'm living with them

&#x200B;

now back to this particular story: why won't i eat fish? i'm not allergic but fish really grosses me out. it smells (i'm the only one in my family who thinks so) and it makes me nauseous. my sickness lasts a maximum of 4 hours after eating and it's really unpleasant for me.

&#x200B;

my family loves fish. it's one of the most frequent items we eat and it's cooked often in the house.

&#x200B;

so when i refuse to eat fish, my parents don't accept my wishes. sometimes they let me eat other items in the menu and skip the fish dish but sometimes they get mad and force me. (they're not bad people, i guess they feel bad when i don't eat the main course.) sometimes they'll offer other stuff like a fried egg or leftover chicken from the day earlier for me, and fish for themselves. i don't think there's a pattern. they do what they want when they feel like it.

&#x200B;

am i being selfish? i mean i do live with them and cannot support myself without them so it's my duty to listen to their wishes. they're already sacrificing common food like potatoes for me *so does it make me an asshole* for refusing an item they love even if it makes me sick for short amounts of time??"

c5nmus	2019-06-26 09:18:00	Rhophototo	WIBTA for calling out friends for leaving my wedding early?	"Ok. So I am a guy that is marrying his long term girlfriend on Friday. We are keeping it a really small affair, only family and close friends (about 30 people in total). This includes 2 of my friends who I have known for over 10 years - let’s call them A and B. 

A and B both live approximately 2 hours train ride from the location we are getting married. A had told me a couple of weeks ago that he has to leave early to meet a friend the next day. He must have arranged this after we sent the invite as he responded that he would be joining me and my wife at some activities the next day. Today I have found out that B is also leaving early. So, they are both arriving on a train about 45 minutes before the service starts and leaving on a train around 9 o’clock at night. In total spending less than 12 hours in the city. Am I being unreasonable to be a bit upset by this?

For further context B is also getting married later in the year. His wedding will be taking place in France, which will require at least half a day travel from where I live in the UK spread across trains, planes and rental cars. In total it is going to be a 4 day round trip. Genuinely interested in thoughts. I haven’t said anything to A and B, and it is probably too late to do so without just creating tension, but I am annoyed that they think that is OK. I am just wondering if our friendship is worth a lot less to them than I had thought.

EDIT: so I have only just figured out I can edit this. Thought it was locked. So general consensus seems to be AITA (although bless all you kind souls that disagreed). I guess I wrote this when I was a bit pissed. As I have put somewhere below I am a bit anxious about all the logistics of everything/making everyone has a good time etc. It kinda set me off that they are arriving as late as possible and leaving as soon as possible. That is probably the most negative interpretation of their actions. 

Soooo... gonna tap out, live my life and look forward to my wedding. Actually been really positive as I probably would have otherwise just stewed on the situation for a bit. So thanks for the comments. Peace out."	Asshole	0	0

c5nlya	2019-06-26 09:15:07	lipsync4urlife	AITA for talking negatively about a Christian homophobic public figure with my (presumably) non-Christian colleague in front of a Christian colleague?	"I want to preface this by saying that I don't have a problem with Christians in general.  That being said, there are a lot of views spouted by right-wing Christians that contradict my views as to how people should be treated (i.e. I'm a pro-choice intersectional feminist and most of my friends and a fair number of family members are part of the LGBTQ community).  I admittedly have a lot of issues trusting people I meet who are Christian as I went to a Christian school and had some bad experiences.

I work in an office with a couple other people, one who is Christian and another who most likely isn't.  Non-Christian and I share similar views and occasionally talk about current affairs.  E.g. there is a situation at the moment where a former professional rugby player is trying to crowdfund $3 million because he got fired for making homophobic comments which were against his contract.  Neither of us said anything negative about his religion itself.  Non-Christian and I both think him being fired was justified but I feel a bit guilty having these conversations because they just kind of happen and Christian colleague might be kind of offended.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr - does it make me an asshole if I talk about current affairs involving a Christian person being homophobic with a colleague?

&#x200B;

Edit:  I am aware that I might be being overly paranoid.  I have anxiety.  I think Christian colleague is a nice person but I don't want to ruin a positive working relationship by possibly insulting them.  Neither of us have actually said anything about the rugby player's religious beliefs.  

The fact that the rugby player is Christian never came up in any of our conversations; the conversation started because we were talking about doing mock trial at school and we were joking that ""maybe \*rugby player\* should have done it so they could learn about contract laws""."

c5nlgx	2019-06-26 09:13:15	doiknow-no	AITA for never apologising to an old friend	"So this is about an old friend (who i haven't been friends with for about 3 years due to all of this) 
This friend used to always have arguments with me and expect me to always apologies which i always refused as i thought i wasn't the bad guy and that these arguements were stupid. Ill give you some example of these disagreements.

I made a group chat to talk about something that is coming up, i only included people who were involved in the event as i thought no one else wants to be annoyed with the messages coming in about something that didn't know. My friend OBVIOUSLY didn't like this as they then had a go at me for not including some people and that i did it on purpose.

Another one is they got annoyed and said they didn't want to be my friends anymore (which she wanted to be my friend after) because i acted differently with my lifelong friends - friends i had know my WHOLE life where as i had know them for about 2/3 years

And possibly one of the biggest arguments was when i politely declined to borrow something from her as it wouldn't be necessary. They then called me stuff like ""ungrateful"" and that i have ""no sympathy for anyone"" and sending 25ish messages saying how mad she is and how hard im making it for her

And this might have been the message she sent that really pushed me to not want to be their friend. I had messaged them just saying ""hey do you want to talk"" to which they responded basically saying that i should get off my phone and actually talk to my family for once instead of staying on my phone all day. In all caps did i mention.

After all these arguements they expected me to apologise while they didn't.

Anyway im no longer friends with her and she's only messaged me since to ask if i could do something which i said yes but never did.

We live about 3 hours drive from eachother right now, so most of our communication is via text and sometimes phone. 

The other day, she asks me a totally loaded question; ""if you could change something about how I look, what would it be?""

My truthful answer was, ""I would change nothing about you."" Followed by, ""maybe just less makeup, I like your natural face and I love to see your freckles.""

I was a bit inebriated from celebrating a friend's birthday, and went on a bit of a rant of how I thought the makeup industry takes advantage of people's insecurities and sells products at a high markup, etc.

She got pretty pissed off, saying things like: ""without cosmetic products, I'd be out of a job."" and ""I don't want to have negative conversation about things I like.""

I never made personal attacks, but just said my opinion on an industry that I think profits on people's insecurities.

He was there for my mom during the whole entire time she was sick and I'll never really be able to express how grateful I am because he really  did so much for her and made her really happy while she was still here. 
I love my dad and I'm happy that he has turned his life around but the one problem was that I really cannot stand him. He doesnt really know any of us. He always treats me like I'm dumb and is kinda homophobic. Please remember that this man has never really been apart of my life. He also is basically unemployed and living with in his parents house in a small village. We had the choice to stay with our dad in Mexico or to go under temporary guardianship of my sister.

c5nied	2019-06-26 09:02:20	Bobby_FuckingB	AITA for wanting to quit my job after my boss has died?	"Quick background. My boss was the ICT director at the company I work for. He handled the day to day infrastructure issues (IT related) & delegated some tasks to a 3rd party company that were to time consuming for him. He prefered to code, but he always made sure that infrastructure was taken care of before joining me (I'm a developer) on fixing bugs / working on new features.

&#x200B;

Back in April, he passed away. He was a good friend & I still miss him. Since then, I've done next to 0 development work because the infrastructure issues have taken up almost all of my time. Granted, a compotent IT professional would get them done a lot faster. But alas, I'm just a coder. I've learned a lot in the last couple of months about servers, active directory & a bunch of other things i'm sure i've forgotten about by now.

&#x200B;

On Monday - I expressed for the 2nd time in the last few weeks - that I was having difficulty in trying to balance all of the work. I wondered if they had made any decision about how our infrastructure is going to managed going forward (it's been over 2 months now). I was told that it's a waste of money for them to hire something to do the job as their isn't enough work to do.

I'm constantly in a bad mood & I'm bringing that home to my family which is a shitty thing to admit & not something I want to continue to do.

I'm not sure where it really started to devolve but I really appreciate those who manage to read most if not all, and decide if person A or person B is being the asshole, or is it both? I'm looking for perspective on the matter as I feel this is very well could be it, depending on how things turn out. I'm genuinely concerned at losing my longest living friend.

c5nh3e	2019-06-26 08:57:44		AITA for blaming my roommate for puking on my carpet	"A couple of months ago my roommate came out the bathroom and yelled at me to get him water. I told him I would in a second. However, he then collapsed on the floor. I got up to start helping him and give him water. He then started puking all over the carpet. I stayed with him as long as I could until I had to deal with someone else who was passed out in the hallway.  His parents then came by and picked him up to go too the ER because he could not stop puking. My roommate claims he had a stomach bug and almost died that day.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months. The night was brought up in a conversation with the same roommate. I said that I blamed him for puking up all over the carpet and he said I was an ass hole for thinking that. He says that it's not his fault for being sick and he could of done literally nothing about being fatally ill. He tells me the ER said he was so dehydrated that he needed extra treatment. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, I'm allowed to be as mad as I want at him. Not only was it him who puked in my room. He also could of taken better care for himself. My roommate has been sick for about 2 weeks straight and he was clearly not getting better. He had the same meal everyday on the same plate(or peace of foil). That he just runs through the sink. Finally, I feel like he was over exaggerating about ""dying"".

c5nfrj	2019-06-26 08:52:22	lonelycourgette	AITA for refusing to let my father walk me down the aisle?	"My parents are born again Christians (Pentecostal Evangelists), I left religion at 16.

They wanted to arrange my marriage and had suggested a few laughable candidates over the years (from when I was 15 years old).

Four years ago (when I was 21) I told them I had gone on a few dates with a guy I really liked and had known for a month. They were generally chill so I didn't feel too worried telling them.

The next morning they kicked me out with my 17 year old youngest sister for ""living an immoral lifestyle they can't support"" and turning away from the family values that they raised us with. 

A year later my other sister (20 at the time) was kicked out for the same reasons.

After knowing my now fiance for two months we took a huge risk and moved in together. Thank god that worked out, I've achieved more than I ever thought I could with his support.
I can't think of anything I would change about my fiance. 

For the first year of our relationship my parents caused drama. They used any opportunity I was alone with them to tell me that our relationship was doomed, until I threatened to cut them out of my life. 
 
For the rest of the years they were always sheepish around my fiance and never made much of an effort to talk to him.

After we became engaged (late last year) my parents suddenly did a u-turn and seem to have accepted my fiance as a part of the family. Which has been a massive mind fuck to me.

At our engagement party we specifically said NO SPEECHS as my dad likes to make himself the centre of attention and does anything to look good. So he ignored our request, made a huge speech and gave a personalised gift to each of us.

I am considering having his father, my grandfather, walk me down the aisle. My grandfathers only daughter passed in her youth. 

My father got wind of it through the grapevine and apparently lost his nut (as expected, and why I was hesitant to bring it up).

A few weeks ago my father tearfully apologised to my fiance for not accepting him in the beginning and to me for saying horrible things. He said he would be okay with my grandfather walking me down the aisle and hoped we could be friends again like we were before I met my fiance. 

The other day my mother came by and I brought up the aisle walking to double check it was okay before I asked my grandfather. 

She told me my father is really hurt and that it's not normal to not let him do it. She also repeated multiple times that they have to be happy for my marriage. 

I told her that after my father apologised I softened, and was going to let them have speeches. Whereas beforehand I intended for them to come only as guests. She said that they may not want to say anything and reiterated how hurt my dad is to not walk me down the aisle.

So for context, I've been staying at a 4* hotel in Spain for the past 2 weeks and I would regularly call my SO throughout to keep in touch and see how she is.

Yesterday night when this took place was the last night I would be able to talk to her since I'm travelling all day today. I decided to call her at around 11 ish at night and the phone call lasted around an hour.

For convenience to my friend I was staying with, I moved out onto the balcony to have the call as to not force every aspect of my relationship onto him.

About 50 minutes into the call, I heard a walloping thud against the head rest coming from the room next door. As to which I promptly quieted down and moved inside and me and my friend both went silent. Then the guy who made that noise came to the balcony and yelled at us to ""shut up"" or he'll call reception. I promptly closed the doors and remained silent for the rest of the night and ultimately having to end the phone call with my SO which bummed me out the most.

My boyfriend has to do a class project (Master degree in Psychology) and he decided to do his project for people with a specific problem I have, which is incredibly cute.
I was super cooperative and supportive, helped him in any way possible to the point that this was known form everyone as ""our"" project even if I don't attend his course. Then, another girl joined and for a while we started cooperating, we had a group on WhatsApp to talk about our progresses and everything was perfect. Our intention (and the class professor one) was to make it a real experiment because our idea was really great.

One day we had a second opinion about our idea with another professor and for some reasons after that moment the girl decided that the idea of making things big wasn't that good for her and that she had other things in mind for her future, my boyfriend agreed and that was the last time I was involved.

Now I discover that they kept going on with the project, which it's fine: they had to do it anyway because it is part of the exam.

The fact that bothers me is that they cut me off completely (never used again the group chat, never even told me how things were going on... Nothing) and today my boyfriend asked me to help again and I lost my temper.

They cut me off completely and act like it's none of my business anymore and then he ask me (privately) to do stuff I wasn't prepared for! If you wanted me in the project, ask in the damn chat created with this precise purpose and tell me what I have to do. In this way (asking me favours privately) it seems that I am only being used and not like I am part of something. 

Also, I found out randomly that they are intentioned again to make the things big. Nice. Especially because again they never told me. This makes me feel even more cut off.

"I have been sleeping in the spare room more and more often recently because my wife kicks me out of bed whenever I break wind. The farts range from loud parping salutes to the dawn or nighttime horrors which pass silently in the darkness. One thing that remains true of most of them is the powerful smell they leave: a kind of beefy sulphur smell which is quite horrendous. I dare say if you smelled it you would assume someone trailed the dog turd of a mutt dying of colon cancer into the room on his shoe.

I understand that it's horrid but my attempts to change my diet have met with howls of protest from my wife and her mother. They originate from Southern China where it's all about spicy food. I am of Chinese heritage (Hong Kong) but I was born and grew up in the west. When I first moved to China I didn't speak the language and always went to MacDonalds because they had a picture menu you could point to. My wife (then my gf) would often find the MD wrappers in my kitchen trash and assumed I hated Chinese food. Now she thinks I use my farts to avoid eating her food.

If I feel like I will let one go I try to vaccate the room but it's not always possible. Sometimes I do it in my sleep... one time, I was awoken by the dog barking at me, frightened by the noxious odour I had produced(EDIT: YES, I have thought of blaming the dog). I have also visited doctors both here and in the UK and have been told to change my diet which I'd be happy to do if it didn't upset my wife.

We all take turns cooking here as both my wife and I work. Her mother takes care of our daughter. She takes such pride in her cooking and I love her and I do enjoy it very, very much.

so there is someone I know who has started a GoFundMe page and wants money for supposed electric bills, food and in order to ""survive"" In his description of that GoFundMe he is saying how poor he is and how much help he needs. I know as a matter of fact that this is bullshit and he has been telling me about it. I know that he buys the newest phones every three months which cost over $1000 and in general buys all kinds of new electronics with his own money + the money he needs to ""survive"". He portrays himself as poor despite that not being the case, which I find disgusting. It has gotten so far, that distant family members of his also started donating money to him despite not knowing his actual situation.

c5nag8	2019-06-26 08:31:18	Teharu	WIBTA if I'll ask my mother to tone down her smoking?	"My mum and I live in an apartment building and her's is the apartment right below mine. She's a chain smoker, been most of her life and gets constantly shit because of it (like many smokers tend to), so understandably it has become an elephant in the room in our family, it's a very touchy subject.

Now, I have never been too pushy about it but my sister on the other hand has aggressively kept demanding her to quit. I figured it's not my business since she's an adult and has been doing it for many decades now, so I stopped hoping and asking she'd quit early in my childhood.

However, things have changed ever since she moved close to me. Our apartments have balconies and since it's summer I keep my door open to get some ""fresh"" air. The other reason for keeping the door open is because my cats love having a free access there (2 of them used to be outdoor cats, so it helps them a lot). She smokes all the fucking time and that smoke comes right into my apartment. I have legit head aches, my throat dries and it gives me a feeling best described as slight light-headedness. Breathing feels really nasty. It wouldn't be an issue if she smoked occasionally, but it's 2-3 cigs in an hour. I think that's an absurd amount. 

I would like to ask her to tone it down a little bit, like maybe max. 1 per hour, that I can handle (if I have to). It has gotten so much worse now that she's on summer vacation from work and thus at home all the time. I have already asked her once to reduce it a little bit couple months ago, but she got visibly upset and often takes the victim role afterwards. 

I don't like policing other people's lives but this seriously hurts mine atm. I can understand my mum as well, she has a very stressful work and personal issues in life, smoking is her way to cope with it. I think I prefer this over her  excessive drinking. It's not easy to quit so easily and some of my friends and relatives have told me in their opinion I'd invade my mum's life by asking her to smoke less. I should also show her respect as she's my mother.

So reddit, AITA here?

TL;DR Mum smokes 2-3 cigs per hour and I'm forced to keep my balcony door closed if I don't want to suffer, I'd like to ask her to reduce the amount."	Not the A-hole	0	0

TLDR: Philosophical disagreement regarding the differences between having a goal and having a purpose.  This dude isn't my actual brother, but he is my brother. He is the only person I know where conversations can get this in depth, but they have been devolving more and more frequently, and almost always in similar fashion.

I'm not sure where it really started to devolve, and I really appreciate those who manage to read most if not all, and decide if person A or person B is being the asshole, or is it both? I'm looking for perspective on the matter as I feel this is very well could be it, depending on how things turn out. I'm genuinely concerned at losing my longest living friend. I will admit to them that I am the asshole in an attempt to make reparations if I am found to be the asshole by the jurors here today. So please know and consider when responding that I'm not taking Redditor's opinion here lightly.

c5n9il	2019-06-26 08:27:31	aanonnn123	AITA for moving out	"First time posting sorry if its terrible 

Anyway.

Last fall my little brother (26m) graduated college and didn't know what he wanted to do next. I (30f) live in a large costal city, and when he asked if he could come live with me I agreed. Naively I assumed he would have some kind of capital when moving out here. Instead he showed up with 17$ in cash. I had to uber him and his dog from the airport as I use public transportation to get around.

I have a very small apartment, and a roomate, so its cramped living quartes, my brother sleeping on a futon I happened to have, my room is all bed at this point. He has no job, doesn't qualify for unemployment, and doesn't have a working computer. Fine fine. Use my laptop, find a job, it will be fine. My roommate has been looking for her own place anyway, so you can take her room when she moves out. 

Two months later he has no job. 

He's living at my neighbors place because she has an extra room, says he will pay rent. Dosen't.

Eventually gets a shitty resturant job ( not disparaging food service, I'm a cook myself, but it was like a job a 16 year old would get in high school, part time minimum wage the whole shabang)

He gets a second job. Things are looking up. My roomates has found a place and is moving out. Brother assures me he can make his half of the rent. 

The first(of june). Rent is due. Brother has apparently been fired from the restuarant. He can't make rent. He gives me half of his half.  My rent is very cheap. There is really no excuse to not be able to cover it. 

I give him one more chance. Get me all you owe me, and be able to pay whole rent by Aug other wise I'm finding my own place. He assures me he will get me the rest of June by the 15th. 

The 15th. No money. Well this sucks. Fine pay me what you can. But this is starting to mess with my finances. 

I go out of town with my boyfriend. While I'm away brother asked to borrow a chef coat for a catering gig. Sure. Go ahead. Make that money. Come home after 48. He has pulled everything out of my closet, trashing my room. I'm super pissed. But don't do anything about it. 

Today I come home and he's thrown away the mail. Thrown away our utility bill. Then my landlord calls asking about the dog. His one job is to hide the dog until he can afford the pet deposit of 300$. July first is looming, he still owes me for June and I've had enough. I told him I'm putting in my notice. 

I feel guilty, I want to help him out. I just can't carry him any more.

This is kind of a weird one because I already know I'm an asshole, but I need to know if I'm being an asshole twice. Also, sorry for how long this is.

So my buddy ""T"" has been hooking up with a girl ""L"" for a few weeks. During the second or third time we all hung out together, they had both expressed to me (individually) that they didn't really get along well and that they didn't things going anywhere. It seemed  
odd that they so quickly vented to me about this, but I figured this is how many tinder-relationships go.

Now eventually we started partying with their friends and, a couple times, L had come on to me a tiny bit. I tried brushing these off as random drunk comments.

As of now, T has been out of the country for a week and a half. He has encouraged me to hang out with L despite him being gone and has even encouraged her to get me to trip on mushrooms. This last Saturday, I went to a party with L and she was able to convince me to ""micro dose"" on shrooms. Part of me thought it wasn't a good idea but she assured me that she'd babysit me if need be, and T encouraged it via texts to us. We both took the mushrooms and continuously drank beer throughout the night. When it was time to leave the party, L needed to be walked back home. I was going to go back to my car after walking her home, but she convinced me to stay since I probably wasn't ready to drive.

L suggests drinking more beer and proceeds to put on a movie and go change... into a big shirt that covers just her underwear. My non-sober mind figures it's no biggy but she then asks if it would be weird to cuddle. I said it wouldn't be weird, but I also tend to be very cuddly when under the influence, and to reiterate: we were both drunk and tripping. Unfortunately the cuddling led to kissing and more.

I'm very aware that we fucked up here and that being drunk and high doesn't excuse what we did. However, it was firmly established that L and T were casual, not exclusive, not really into each other, and had not seen long-term potential. Again, this doesn't excuse us doing what we did without at least consulting T first. We both told him about it when we sobered up the following day and we both apologized profusely.

T responded saying that it wasn't a big deal and that although he wouldn't want to continue things with L, he was still great friends with me and hoped to be friends with L. He even told me that it was a bit of a blessing since he wasn't sure how he'd want to end things with L.

Now for some reason, tonight, T decided to send me a venmo request of $250 and claim that I need to make amends for ruining their relationship and cover the costs of what he'd spent on her in terms of food and gas money etc. He also claims that I'm getting off easy.

I certainly know that I fucked up and had even told him that I wouldn't blame him for hating me, but I think that the $250 request is ridiculous.

c5n5vl	2019-06-26 08:12:36	Fuckmoochers	"AITA for making my friend feel ""unwelcome"" in my house after 2 years of staying with me?"	"Some context, I (21M) live in a cramped house with my parents and two brothers.

To begin with, he only came to stay with us after an argument broke out with his parents and he got kicked out of his house. We'd agreed the living situation was temporary- maybe a few weeks max, just long enough for his parents to cool off. It was great in the beginning. My parents loved him. He would do chores around the house (moreso than me and my brothers), wouldn't ask for anything, etc. As time went on, I didn't push him to leave because he would say he had no other place to go, and I believed him. Considering the circumstances, especially the lack of space (he would make do by sleeping on my living room couch) in contrast with his lavish tastes, I couldn't see why he'd possibly want to stay any longer than he had to. His job brings in hefty (albeit inconsistent) checks that he would spend on new clothes, shoes, jewellery, ordering food every day, etc.

Having an extra person around has really strained the freedom I have in my house. We had to compromise about when I could have my friends over if he was working in the living room. I had to work around having his friends and girlfriend over at times I didn't really want them there. I would have to ask him in advance to leave if I had plans to hang out downstairs with my girlfriend. For a while, I ignored the red flags. I could tell he was milking it, but at the time he was still my friend. My mental health wasn't all there, and he supported me when nobody else understood what I was going through. So I dealt with all of these things.

Once I'd realized that the situation was getting bad, I thought that he would at least be considerate enough to try to leave as quickly as possible. Boy was I wrong. He would say he was looking for apartments, and that he was moving on some date. Then as it approached he would either extend his deadline or tell me things had fallen through. Eventually the vibe between us completely changed and the situation reached a breaking point. I asked him if sometime soon he could leave for a while so I could spend it with my girlfriend. He replied that he'd see what he could do, but that if he didnt find anything, he wouldnt just go out for no reason. That ticked me off. I mentioned that I'd let him stay with me for a long time. When I began confronting him about it, he flew off the handle. He said that he knew I didnt feel like he was welcome in my house, and called me a narcissist. Worse, my brother (who had overheard the whole thing) defended him and said that whether or not my friend stayed with us wasnt my decision because it wasn't just my house. Now we're not even friends anymore but he's still here.

Tl;dr: My friend moved in with me after getting kicked out of his place. Pretty sure he has enough money (but no intention) to leave. Nobody in my house seems to see a problem with this. I tried confronting him and he said he feels ""unwelcome"" by me.




UPDATE: To add some context, no, he doesn't regularly pay rent, but neither do I and neither does the brother in question. I put a more elaborate explanation about our finances in the comments. About the situation, my parents seem to be fine with it. They don't really care. They enjoy his company. He stays out of their way as much as possible so it doesn't really have any negative effect on them. Once upon a time (a year or so back), they were ready to kick him out because after conflict had came up within a mutual friend group, he said he ""wanted to punch me in the face"" and said other things that were completely uncalled for. He apologized when I saw him next so we made up before they got a chance to, but mind you, they were mad in their own right. They had only let him stay because I'd told them we had made up. Now, I've spoken to them about issues that have similarly been cropping up (him trying to be secretive about talking shit about me and my girlfriend (of many years)'s relationship to a long time mutual friend right in front of us and in my own house (but then having loud, toxic arguments with his own girlfriend in my living room, which we've had the grace not to throw back in his face), pretty much using me and our house despite the fact that he's monetarily well off and always brags about how many thousands of dollars he's made this week, him not pretending to make the pretense of talking to me at all anymore- even before our argument- besides in passing, but blatantly schmoozing my parents, etc.) Not to mention the fact that by this point, he's made up with his own parents. Despite telling them all of this they aren't taking any steps to ensure he has a plan to leave any time soon. They even allowed him to be a part of a family meeting recently, even though one of the topics that my parents mentioned was my and my brother's mental health which I thought was completely inappropriate."

My bf told me that he was a little drunk because his friend gave him a bottle of something called “Seagrams Escapes.” I asked him how he got home and he said that his friend dropped him off. I prodded further and he said that his friend also had a bottle of the stuff. I was pissed at this point. I can’t believe my bf would be so dumb as to get in a car with a drunk person. He kept saying that it was no big deal and that his friend is a big guy and one bottle is nothing. I was extremely mad and started to talk about the dangers of drunk driving and how people I know have DIED from drunk driving car crashes. I’m still shook at how stupid my bf, who I thought was so intelligent, could be. I wanted to tell his mom or sister who could knock some sense into him and decided against it after. I’m still extremely upset from his decision and sad that he doesn’t value his own life. Aita for getting mad at him? He said he was laughing at me and called me a dumbass	Asshole	1	0

c5n40c	2019-06-26 08:05:24	throwawayfgs2001	WIBTA if I took my moms ex off our phone plan?	"For some background, My mom and her ex broke up back in December 2018. This man was such a douche bag. He always complained about me ""not having a real job"" or paying any bills (I work in a family business owned by my brothers and dad. Saving my money for college)(side note: I didn't get a ""real job"" because I live about 15-20 out of town and I didn't have a car at the time). I went to school daily using my moms car to get to and from class and to and from work everyday. Couldn't use moms car other than for school as she had work immediately after which was at 12PM. 

When they broke up, I asked my mom if she had gotten his name off of our lease and any bills she shared with him (phone, car insurance etc.) since I knew she'd either forget or just not do it. Us three shared a phone plan together for $90/month. Mom said she'd cover it for me since she wants me to continue saving my money, which is great!

This week, mom found out her card expired and she can't make the phone payment over the phone, so she transfers the money from her bank account to mine, and I pay it using my card. The company we're with charges $3 to pay on the phone and they HEAVILY encourage that you pay online for free, which is what I planned on doing.

As I'm paying I read the bill summary. $40 for moms phone, $20 for my phone, and $30 for ex's phone??? I was so confused. Back in December, mom had told me she took him off the bill. I trusted her. I called the company to see what's up and they said that they NEVER received a call in December inquiring about canceling an account. They said they cannot refund me the money, but if I took the line off right now, they'd lower my bill by $10 (I'd be losing a $20 discount which is why the bill only goes down to $80 rather than $60) I'm hurt because I feel my mom lied to me. I don't know if I should take off the line anyways or talk to her about it since she is the one who makes payments on it and can do whatever she wants with her money. 
 
EDIT: I'm 18, started paying rent at 17. When he left, I had to pick up the weight and help with rent from my savings.

EDIT 2: TL;DR my mom is still paying for her ex's phone bill and I wanna take it off our plan. We don't make a lot of money either so this would help a little bit, plus he was a douche and hated me."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5n3we	2019-06-26 08:04:53		AITA because I don’t want to visit my half-sister?	"I’m 20 and she’s 15, so a bit of an age gap there. We share the same father, who wasn’t very active in our lives to begin with (but now he is a huge part of my life). My sister was kind of a bratty kid (and by “kind of” I mean extremely). She was manipulative, threw temper tantrums when she didn’t get her way, and would hit and bite me all the time. Typical of kids. We usually saw each other when my dad would pick us both up, but going over to my dad’s became stressful for me whenever my sister was there. Eventually I told him I would rather that he pick us up at separate times (I must’ve been 10 here). From then on, I rarely saw her. Maybe a couple times a year. We grew apart as I lived a very sheltered life. I was bullied frequently in school and also lived in an abusive household. So I was definitely dealing with a lot and became sort of estranged with that side of the family. 

It’s definitely something I’ve come to regret in my later years. I wish I were more involved in her life as a role model, someone who could guide her with my older sister wisdom. Every year without fail I wish her a happy bday, but I never get one in return despite my bday being just a few days after hers. I’ve attempted to make a connection with her so many times. I continuously reached out and asked to get together but I’m usually told that she’s busy. When we do see each other at my dad’s (which I forgot to mention earlier, she has very limited contact with him), we get along just fine. We talk, laugh, etc. But in a sense it feels like I’m talking to a stranger. She moved out of the city a year ago and every now and then I’ll shoot her a text and ask how life is going. We chat for a bit and then the convo goes dry. She comes down to visit every now and then (for her grandma and friends) but never notifies me when she does, I always find out from my dad. When I text her asking if we could get together, she always tells me she’s extremely busy and has too many plans with other friends. 

I honestly don’t think my sister is doing this out of malice and I believe she is a busy person. I think because I wasn’t involved in her life, she probably feels no attachment to me, thus doesn’t think to prioritize me. Which is understandable 1000%. But I’ve decided that I don’t want to continue putting in effort to developing a relationship with her if it’s not reciprocated. When my dad notified me yesterday that she’s in town for the next few days, he kept urging me to go see her. Usually I’m the one to initiate, but this time I just told my dad that he can tell her to text me if she wants to get together. I figured if she was interested she would’ve notified me that she’s visiting anyway. 

My dad’s pretty upset with me now because he thinks I’m being rude by not contacting her to act least say hi. But idk, I just don’t see the point? If someone isn’t interested in having a relationship with me then I don’t want to bother them. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c5n393	2019-06-26 08:02:24	Brookshone	AITA for causing problems within my group of friends?	"I’m sorry if the title doesn’t make too much sense. Also, I’m sorry fo the mildly petty drama ahead, we’re all 17 to 18 years old. This is probably unnecessarily long and confusing. 

A group of about 10 people went out for dinner and then we agreed to go have a bonfire at the beach afterwards. The agreed upon meet up time was 7:00, but my friend, S, came late with her boyfriend at 7:40, and we didn’t order dinner until 7:30 because we were trying to be polite. Dinner is awkward but relatively fun. 

I take 4 people in my car (including me) as we head over to the beach, the others were all divided up into two other cars. Two girls leave early in the second car - they told us this a few days before hand so it was ok. The third car has S, her boyfriend, and two friends. Another friend shows up later for the bonfire (she got dropped off, by her mom but needed a ride home). 

S’s drops off the 2 friends in her car at the beach and leaves with her boyfriend. Now I only have room to take home 4 people in my car, with me driving. Unfortunately, there are 6 people who were promised rides but only 4 car seats. I originally only agreed to take 3 people home. (This is kinda unrelated but one of the parents was able to take 2 people home last minute, while I took the other 4). 

Now, I know I’ve completely pained S as TA, so here’s the part where AITA comes it. 

Earlier that day, S, two other friends, and I went to the mall. I made the whole event extremely awkward. I felt unwelcome and isolated within that group but I did not try at all to ease any of the tension I felt. I did not tell anyone I was uncomfortable and not enjoying myself and expected the 3 friends to figure it out, which is entitled. They did go into stores which made me uncomfortable but they wanted to stay in them so I didn’t push. 

At dinner, the mall group (S and the two friends) all felt unwelcome at dinner and this prompted them all to leave early. I could have done more to make them not feel so unwelcome. I was not inviting to them as I could have been. 

After dinner, I was on the phone with my mom and S tried to call me then, but I did not get the message due to being on the phone with someone else. 

So after all of this, I talked with one of the mall trip friends. She essentially told me that I should apologize to S and I told her I would. She said I should have advocated for myself during the mall trip (I could’ve said, why don’t we go to the movies, why don’t we do X activity). I was not inviting at dinner and I made the whole mall trip awkward and unpleasant for bottling up my emotions. But something about apologizing for messing up dinner and subsequently the bonfire doesn’t sit right with me, after all, S did leave me to somehow get 6 people home without making sure the people she promised rides to had a way to get home, and I felt very isolated during the mall trip.

c5n2mu	2019-06-26 08:00:16	hurricaneswain	WIBTA If I put plants and garden bed edging on our lawn so our neighbours stop driving on it?	"Background/block layout: We live in a block of units that runs perpendicular to the street, so there is one long driveway going up the block that all the front doors open on to. Each unit has a small lawn at the entrance, with lots of plants under the front windows etc but nothing directly next to the driveway. Each unit has one car space in the parking lot, however as we're so close to a hospital all street parking is ticketed, timed (2h or less), or permit ($200 per year). We have one car, and our neighbour in unit one has no car and lets us use his space if we need - someone visiting, etc. 

&#x200B;

The issue: One of the apartments two doors from us has a lot of people living in it. This doesn't bother us at all; they're a lovely family with a new baby and grandparents and a few cousins. They have a couple cars, and with the baby and the grandparents they often park on their front lawn to make it easier to get from the unit to the car. This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't drive on my grass to get there. Part of the grass is now dead and muddy (its been raining a lot here and gets dewy in the morning), so its not likely to grow back on its own. It looks bad, and I really don't like it.

&#x200B;

I have asked them politely to stop driving on the grass; they said they would stop, but haven't. I have asked a couple times. The block owner has put a few signs up saying ""don't drive/park on the grass"", to no avail.

&#x200B;

I have put a lot of effort into the garden on my lawns, and it makes me kind of upset that they don't respect my wishes enough to just not drive on my lawn. We rent, don't own (we do have permission to garden to our hearts' content though) so I don't really have any power without getting landlord/body corporate involved. I really couldn't care less what they do on their own lawn; I could go to their landlord and dob them in for parking on their lawn but I'm not going to do that because I do like them.

The question: Would I be the asshole if I line the grass with plants and borders to stop them driving on it? My partner thinks its overkill, but I just want my yard to look nice and not driven on."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"A little backstory, we dated about 10 years ago for about a year or so and we lost contact and got back into contact about a year ago. We dated a little, didn’t work out, so we remained friends and even had sex  (once or twice) and cuddled and watched movies often.

We’ve never cared to start dating again or anything but we have been basically acting like we’re dating ever time we hang out. she did make it clear she wanted to only be friends now and I drew the line there and told her basically, unless you’re bringing something to the table like sex, I’m not interested in being just friends. I know her too much as another thing to just be her friend while other dudes date her and whatever. So I told her I don’t want to talk to her unless she was able to bring something to the table.

I find no use in having my ex around unless there’s some benefit from it. And just being “friends” isn’t at all worth it to me.... AITA?

tl;dr- refuse to be friends with ex unless she’s willing to be intimate or something, so I cut ties, AITA?"		1	0
c5mzh5	2019-06-26 07:47:57	rickety_priest	AITA for getting mad at my mother for giving away some of my sweets to poor homeless children in our neighbourhood?	"I'm (23M) spending the summer at my parents' place.

Yesterday I went for lunch with a close friend of mine whom I hadn't met in ages. She gifted me some sweets and chocolates she got from a place she recently visited. They were quite expensive and rare, not even available in the country where I reside. When I got back home, I shared these treats with my parents and they really enjoyed them. I left them in the refrigerator overnight so that they do not get spoilt.

Today I noticed about a third of the sweets had disappeared, which is too large a quantity to just have been consumed during the night. I asked my parents about this and my mom (49F) proudly stated that she'd distributed all of that among some poor homeless kids in our neighbourhood. I was instantly furious that she would do that and I told her that she had no right to give them away as they were mine and I had planned on sharing them with some friends and relatives apart from with the family. She got angry at me stating that there's still a large portion left and that I was an inconsiderate selfish spoilt brat who had no sympathy for poor people. My father wasn't mad at me but was disappointed with my reaction saying I shouldn't be so small-hearted.

Now I would like to make it clear why I was angry at her. It was not due to her act of charity itself but more so because:
        
* I had received the sweets as a gift and they were not my mom's to give away, no matter how much quantity
* They were expensive in value and rare in availability
* I consider myself charitable having consistently donated 10% of my monthly earnings since I was 18 regardless of how much I made, a practice I learnt from my parents
* My mother has a habit of doing stuff like this such as giving away my old items and clothes without asking me because ""I could probably do without them"" and I've told her in the past that I'd like to be asked if I want any of my belongings to be given away
* Recently she has been going overboard in her giveaways ever since her father passed away a few months back; he was well known by his friends and family for going out of his way to help the needy by way of volunteer work and philanthropy. Since his passing I feel my mom has been overly passionate about every little act of charity she does which I understand is her way of coping but in this case I feel it's uncalled for

**TL;DR:** I am infuriated because my mother, without asking me, donated a portion of sweets I'd received as a gift from a friend to homeless kids in our area.

Here's what happened. 

I live with my dad now, my mum is in another state. Now I was raised in a 'close-knit' family. And all my life it's always been about you should put family first, sacrifice this, sacrifice that and not even the big stuff. Just this mentality of you must be super involved in your family members business. Show respect and just typical conservative BS. 

Anyways, my brother who also lives with my dad was sick a few days ago. He had diarrhea from eating a fuckton of cereal and milk. And he had to go to the hospital. He was there for a few hours. Now I called my brother to check on him, and when I got back home went straight to his room to see if he was okay. 

Here is the problem. My mum said I should have told her. Now I assumed my brother (who is 26 years old!) Will tell her himself. Or even if he didn't for fuck sake it wasn't a big deal. Either ways I didn't not feel it was my business to call her and tell her. Now I used to do this before because that is how I was raised. But now I simply don't give a fuck. I'm just trying to find employment and move out. But she just went on and on about how I should have told her, and how I should be serving my dad dinner (tf?!) and how I don't care and just stay in my room all day and I should be observing things and telling her. I should stand as a mother of the house in her absence (lmfao...if i wanted to be a mother i would have a kid) i'm the youngest btw, but the only girl.

A few months ago, my boyfriend’s (35M) father had a stroke and he’s now pretty much bed bound. My BF takes care of him when his mother is working. Now, he is not close to his parents. They provided him the basic necessities growing up, but was never emotionally nurturing. Because of this, he doesn’t really have a relationship with them.

I told him via text despite the lack of emotional support he received growing up, it’s never too late to build a relationship with them especially his father knowing the state he’s in.

"So my mom is super religious and is saying she won't pay for my wedding unless i have it at a specific church. I don't want a wedding at her church or even my fiance's family's church, i want my wedding outside, but i really can't afford to have even a small wedding with like 5 people and i need her help to pay. My future husband works full time while I'm a full time mommy. And he doesn't really care where it is. I'm the only one who doesn't want it in a church. He nor his parents care where it is. Am i the asshole for not wanting to get married in a church?

Edit: first off, this wedding isn't for another 2 1/2 years this isn't something that's happening in a week, and the only reason I'd like her help is because we've both got giant fucking families and we've each got 7 brothers and sisters with our parents being one of 5 as well so it's not like it's going to be tiny. I may just do a court house wedding and then do a reception party after but idk, I'd have to talk to FH for that.

Edit: I'm also not religious by any means and certainly not the religion she is but i haven't told her that cause she's really hypocritical. She's the only one i can't stand on my side, but I'm afraid if they knew that i wasn't what they raised me then I'd never see that family again.

Edit: thanks everyone, I've talked it over with FH and brought up we could just do a courthouse wedding and then a big reception later on or we could do something very small like parents grandparents and friends. My parents are paying for the venue for the reception, they were adamant about it, and his parents are paying for most of everything else for the reception."	Asshole	0	0

Always shares “saving the planet” posts, somehow stopped our office from supplying plastic water bottles and insisted everyone brings in their own reusable ones, he created recycle bins for us. Once I bought candy in individual plastic wrappers and he commented on what a waste of plastic it was. If you don’t recycle, or use unnecessary plastic, he *will* call you awful and pathetic. 

I do support his cause and have never opposed, although he can be a bit aggressive about it at times. No one else opposes or advocates for what he says, so I think he feels he should take initiative. The thing is that he has quite the smoking habit, goes out for maybe 3-4 smoke breaks a day. I go on walks outside and run into him on his breaks sometimes. 

I’m thinking about mentioning that his smoking is bad for the environment when catching him on a smoke break. Tbh idk *how* bad it is for the environment, but I know it’s bad. Idk if this is an asshole move, esp since this bleeds into personal realm. He’s “tried quitting” kinda but always goes back to it.

c5mtnp	2019-06-26 07:26:45	projectbogle	WIBTA for getting my flatmate’s deposit reduced?	"I’m currently a first year student at university and I’m living in halls of residence. In my halls, flats are split into groups of five flats, with a shared kitchen and social space. In my flat, right from the outset, there was never much socialising. We all got on fine, it was just that we weren’t friends and we mixed in different circles. This was fine to begin with, but then the mess started piling up in the kitchen.
I would wash up all of my stuff ASAP, but nobody else was doing the same. The bins were piling up and I was the only one taking them out. 

About 2 months in, I moved into my boyfriend’s flat. His flatmates all got on very well and all shared chores. They socialised and went out together. I rarely went to my flat. This is when the kitchen started getting really bad. There were piles  of rubbish, behind the door, since nobody was taking it out. The floor was covered in bits of food. There were mounds of washing up. In April, I checked the fridge, and found a carton of milk which had a use by date of November. On multiple occasions, my friends and I deep cleaned the entire kitchen, only for it to go back to its usual state within a week. My kitchen was a pile of filth. 

Once one of my bf’s flatmates moved out at the end of term, I moved a lot of the stuff from my kitchen up to his flat, into the  empty cupboards. Pans, Tupperware, utensils, cutlery, bowls etc. I left downstairs everything which I would use upon my bf’s departure, as I was staying another 2 weeks. 

My bf is moving out this week, so we’ve been beginning to pack up stuff and take some of my stuff from his flat back down to mine. I went into the kitchen to see if it was any cleaner, I was shocked when I saw it was spotless. All of my flatmates had moved out and cleaned so that we would get our full deposits. I should mention that in order to get our deposits however, we can’t leave ANYTHING behind. 

Someone had thrown out all of my stuff. I had no plates anymore. I’d bought a washing up bowl for uni, which was now gone. More Tupperware was gone, washing up liquid, oil to cook with, mixing bowls were gone. I have another two weeks left at uni, I don’t know what I’m supposed to eat off. My mum is furious and wants me to report it, but they might take it out of my flatmates deposit and I know they were only trying to get their deposits back, but couldn’t they have checked? They all had me on Facebook! They could have messaged me or checked with reception! I’m a student, I can’t afford to buy a whole new set of crockery etc., and I really don’t want to have to buy a new bottle of washing up liquid that I’ll only use for 2 weeks, where as I had one that was mostly full in my cupboard. I messaged them on Facebook and one of them owned up to it and gave a half assed apology, but he didn’t offer to replace anything.

1. If I give her X time to tell our parents, or else I tell them. Deal with the guilt caused by my parents immeasurable grief
2. Let  her continue to lie
3. Go ahead and talk to my parents about it. I'll go to my dad first. I can't break this to my mom.
4. For texting her in the first place.

I feel like I'm the asshole no matter what I do

My  adult sister has been living a double life, again! AGAIN. A DECADE ago she moved out for college. She ended up married, pregnant,  living with her then-husband and none of us knew. She was 19 and he was 45. Abusive stalker. My sister didn't contact us for a couple of days so my parents  got worried. Worried ensued, so my parents asked if there was anything I  could do to track her down. I found her real facebook that had all the proof. Wedding pictures and all. Bad ending, but she got away.

&#x200B;

I am  the first one to discover our first bombshell family issue. It broke my  parents heart. Ten years later, it is happening again and I do not know what  to do. I have discovered another double life that she has been living.  She is married, is a mother, and I believe she just gave birth to a  child (additional kid may be product of the husband).

Her lease was coming up on her apartment and car. She claims she moved  into a work friend's house. The house was renovated and owned by her  father. She would only have to pay nominal rent.

She  also claimed that she is able to use her then-work friends vehicle for family holidays and visits. After she surrendered her car, she rolled in this nice SUV w/ retractable foot rails with dealership tags. It was her ''roommates vehicle"".

Today,  the parent's house phone rings. Mom doesn't answer calls she doesn't know. One message  ""Ms. X"" name. Mom didn't recognize X  last name. Mom asks sister to look up the numbers. She claimed they were Indian scam bots.

I tracked #s down to a  local business in the city she lives in. It's a car place and the auto  loan agency literally at the same address.

Her  facebook is the bombshell again.Found recent wedding photos; family photos, new born, everything. I  texted her.

Why did you put the parents house phone number on a credit loan; they called you? I don't have a car

Why did you lie about having a social media? I'm not doing anything.

\*post screenshot of her facebook page with recent post and pictures\*  Nope

I saw a wedding photo, it's recent. Nope

I'm concern what is going on right now? About what

&#x200B;

That's where I stopped texting. She made her facebook private mid conversation.

How can someone lie in face of all that evidence?

Getting  married, having babies, whatever you want to do at 30 is okay. She's an  adult. The issue is she been living a double life again. She lied about  the car. She lied about her living situation. She has a whole other  family."	Not enough info	0	0
c5msn0	2019-06-26 07:23:17	inochiishtal	WIBTA if I ask my partner to clean up his cum stains?	"Hi all. I ran into kind of a weird thing today. On the rug in front of the toilet in our shared bathroom are two noticeably large cum stains. I know he masturbates in the bathroom a lot (what else would you be doing in a locked bathroom for over an hour without the shower running?) and I have NO problem with porn or him masturbaiting or anything of the sort. How do I know they're cum stains? Well... you can just tell. And they're right by my feet when I sit down to use the toilet. 😬

That being said, the cum stains are kind of big and gross.

Sadly, he gets annoyed whenever I joke or acknowledge about him masturbaiting when he leaves the bathroom after an extended period of time (""feel better?"") or ask him to clean up after himself. He says he doesn't need to be reminded (although it can take him days to do something without me reminding him. He refuses to watch porn with me or talk about what he likes which is kind of annoying, and I know he does it when we're both home and I'm likely in the mood, so to be fair there probably is some resentment that would come through me saying something about it. 

This is a touchy subject for him and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells whenever it comes up. I'm afraid that if I point out the stains and ask him to clean them up or to be more careful next time he'll pull a common card on me (""why don't you clean it up if it bothers you instead of asking me"") or act like I scolded him for watching porn (it's just the stain, it gross and I think he should be responsible for it). I feel like I clean up after him a fair amount as it is with dishes, food cans, and trash and this just shouldn't be my responsibility.

I’m going to go into my story and the honors I received at graduation not to flex or brag or anything but to emphasize how important the ceremony is to me. I [18F] have struggled with my mental health for years and honestly expected to have killed myself or dropped out before graduating high school. I left my public school in my sophomore year and was hospitalized, attended an outpatient program, and then went off to the private therapeutic school I graduated from. 

I worked incredibly hard to dig myself out of the hole I was in and ended up receiving awards in each of my classes, receiving a Presidential Scholar award, an award named for the founder of the school and being valedictorian. I was also class president, so I was asked to give a speech at graduation. My sister knew I would be receiving awards and giving a speech, but not the nature of the awards. 

I had 9 kids in my graduating class, so the ceremony was a bit intimate and detailed (hence I can see how it might not be interesting to someone not as invested) but due to the small class I didn’t think it was painfully long. I was glowing and overjoyed after graduating, and when I went back to the room where my phone was to take off my robes and head down to the reception for cake, and the like, I saw my sister [14F]sitting on the staircase with headphones in, watching YouTube videos on her phone. It honestly broke my heart because I was so excited and proud and she had just left. Even my extremely distractible and antsy grandparents made it through the ceremony.

I asked my mother when she had left and found out it was before my speech. That just made me sadder. Apparently my sister didn’t feel well, and had left to sit alone in the hall. She also didn’t join us out for dinner that night and went home to talk to her friends on Discord. 

Clearly she wasn’t bothering anyone or making noise because of her headphones and her position outside of the ceremony, but I’m honestly pissed off that she didn’t manage to sit through the ceremony. Am I expecting too much of her since she wasn’t feeling well and is young? Or am I justified in being upset? This happened like a week ago so I don’t think I’ll bring it up because she’s very sensitive about things like this and I don’t want to start a fight."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5mp91	2019-06-26 07:11:38	actuallyagirl448	AITA for not correcting my online friends about my gender? They think I’m a guy, but I’m a girl.	"A few months ago I joined a forum for an online game that I’ve been playing for a while and want to get better at. Like the game’s players, most of the forum’s members are male. My handle is gender neutral (like MadScientist or NeuroticChef), but in the info for gender I indicated Female. 

I talked to and became friends with a few people, and I noticed that they always refer to me as Bro/Dude/He/Him. It’s not unusual for guys to indicate their gender as female in their gaming profiles (I honestly have no idea why, I just know it’s a common thing) so maybe they assumed that I’m one of the people who do that. I never bothered to correct them because 1. I don’t think my gender is relevant to talking about the game (although we’ve talked about some real life stuff as well) and 2. I don’t know why but I find it awkward to have a conversation like this:

Friend: Bro, just replace Item A with Item B. It doesn’t give you movement speed bonus but you get better mana regen and physical defense.

Me: That’s a great idea, thanks! By the way, I’m not a guy, I’m a girl.

Some of the people I befriended have asked to add me in Facebook, but I honestly don’t have an account there so I told them that. 

One of my friends in real life (a guy) recently also joined the forum and when he saw that my friends there think that I’m a guy, he told me to tell them that I’m a girl. He said some of them might get upset that they thought they’ve been talking to another guy all this time and I never corrected them. I argued that my gender is not information that my online friends absolutely need to know. He said it’s fine not to tell my gender to people I’ve talked to online once or twice, but when we’ve been talking regularly for weeks and I’m describing them as ‘online friends’, then I shouldn’t be lying to them by continuing to let them think that I’m a guy when I’m not.

&#x200B;

Carmen and Chris were 20 minutes late to dinner.  When they arrived, Carmen apologized for being late and said Chris had family that was coming over tomorrow so she was trying to get the house ready.  My GF Anna immediately asked why wasn't Chris doing this?  I thought it was already unfair to assume he wasn't.  Carmen said Chris had went to the gym after work, but when he got home he did help until it was time to go.  Anna quipped, ""You're not his maid.  Its his family, he should be cleaning.""

&#x200B;

Anna is a staunch feminist.  A lot of her identity is encompassed by this.  I'm ecstatic about this because we agree on, and are both enthusiastic about 90% of her feminist values.  I think it would be more ideal if she didn't base a lot of her identity on feminism, but to each their own.  I have also noticed that she only fights for equality in situations that benefit her, not situations in which actually egalitarianize (made up word) the sexes, but it doesn't bother me overall so I don't mention it.

I thought that it was a bit unfair for Anna to try to embarrass Chris in front of the group.  I pointed out that she doesn't know the ins and outs of their household responsibilities and contributions.  Anna said she didn't need to know that in order to determine Chris was being sexist by going to the gym while his GF was at home cleaning up.  Carmen was in an abusive relationship prior, and Chris gifted her $5k to get out of it and get her own place while she didn't have a job for an entire year before they started dating.  They are now together, but she still doesn't work.  I also know Chris has issues with depression, anxiety, and stress and that getting out of the house and getting a good workout helps.  I find it really hard to believe Chris is not doing his fair share within his household, and I also think its unfair to act like Chris going to the gym is the same thing as him just wasting time.  So after Anna called him sexist, I said, ""There are situations in which some would call you sexist if they didn't know the full story.""  

&#x200B;

Her jaw dropped and she demanded to know what situations.  I asked her to just change the subject because its not important right now.  She insisted and kept making passive-aggressive comments/jabs at me, which I ignored.  Then our bill came and she made a big show about paying the bill and telling the table, ""I'm sexist but I'm paying the bill!"" which is the first time she's ever paid for our dinner.  So I finally said, ""You're a feminist of convenience.  If it doesn't favor you, you don't care about it.  If it does favor you, you take advantage of it.""  She called me a liar and demanded examples, so I gave her 2 good ones.  She made excuses as to why they weren't valid, then got pissed off at me for trying to ""call her out"" in front of her friends with my fake reasons."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c5mozr	2019-06-26 07:11:04		AITA for not going to my friend's bachelor party?	"A friend of mine is getting married in the fall and I'm in the wedding party. The best man was discussing with the rest of us the bachelor party he was trying to organize. Since my friend is a big baseball fan it would involve a road trip to go see his favorite team in their home city and spend a few days there. When you factor in the tickets for the game, gas, food, a hotel stay, etc. it looked like it could run me several hundred dollars. 

I have bills to pay, rent, student loans, and I'm working on saving up to buy a house eventually. It's way too much money for me to consider right now and I said given this and also a couple others in the party said they probably wouldn't be able to afford that, we should do something smaller and close to where we all live and offered a few suggestions. They were all shot down, others said we should spend more if it meant doing something our friend liked. When I mentioned it wasn't fair to the other people who couldn't make it, they responded that both of those people said they were fine just sitting it out and meeting up for drinks or something closer to the wedding. That's true but I feel they only said that to be nice. I was trying to stick up for us and felt as though I was just being argued with. So after a week or so of trying to change their plans I said fine, I'll just sit it out then if you're not going to include everyone.

I definitely wasn't happy about the situation but figured that was the end of it. A couple weeks after though I posted pictures of the new cat I had bought to facebook and was angrily messaged by one of the people who did go on the trip calling me a selfish asshole for trying to make the trip about myself and then making a large unnecessary purchase anyway. I told him it's my own business how I spend my money and I let them do what they wanted for the trip so it didn't even make a difference.

c5mmuu	2019-06-26 07:03:45	DifficultPete	AITA for flaking last minute on a road trip that was very important to my mother?	"First post ever so please excuse any goofs! I feel like I made a reasonable decision at the time but now my whole family is giving me the cold shoulder so I'm not sure? Last weekend was my uncle's 50th wedding anniversary and my mom had been freaking out about it for weeks. It's a 13 hour car ride.
    
 I never actually wanted to go, since I don't know her side of the family and I would also have had to stay with my dad, who I'm not comfortable around, but I decided I would go so that I could drive when it got dark. Mom cannot drive in the dark, I have seen her literally drive off the road when it's dark.
    
 I (21f), through a combination of elusive legal documents and generally being a dumbass, don't actually have a valid driver's license. For this I know I am a scoundrel and a fool, but there wasn't much I could do about that when she pulled up to my house less than 24 hours before the anniversary party, which is when things went south. I find out from my little brother that my mom hadn't slept a wink last night. She was hysterical tearing the house apart looking for materials for a lamp she was making for my uncle, a terrible (albeit cute) fire hazard of a lamp. I hate that lamp. I HOPE it catches on fire. Paper crafts have interfered with my familial relationships for the last time. She was slumped over asleep when I walked up to the car. Suddenly the 13 hour road trip goes from unappealing to unsafe (?)
     
     Ok, I'll drive the whole way I guess. Then I remembered that the tags on the car were expired. Cops hate that. The risk of me getting busted for driving illegally has increased exponentially. We're very poor and can't even afford the gas to go on this trip let alone a huge fine.
   
  I can either go and risk financial ruin or stay and let my sleep deprived mom drive off a cliff. I beg her to stay because it's too dangerous but she insists she has no choice . I beg my brother not to  go since I felt she was being reckless, but he really wants to hang with dad. I went into the house to cry and they left. 
   
  Nobody died because mom picked up a friend to drive in the dark. She hadn't told me about her plan to have this friend tag along because she knew none of us would have gone otherwise, we're uncomfortable around the friend for unrelated reasons. Now mom is beefin and won't answer my messages, little brother thinks I was an asshole. Should I have risked it?

c5mmha	2019-06-26 07:02:28		AITA for not responding to my friend when she texts me?	"This happened a while ago, but I’m wondering if I was an asshole. I was maybe 13-14at the time.

So I was friends with this girl, let’s call her Emma, for a few years. I met her at my local PAC and she lived in my neighborhood. Our parents were good friends, so we hung out at their house and sang karaoke, and genuinely had a good time. 

Now, Emma’s in a wheelchair. I’m not exactly sure, but I think her legs just don’t move. She can kinda stand with a walker, but that’s it. I didn’t care at all because she was my friend, but I started to when it became her identity.

She was ALWAYS acting pitiful (not necessarily to be deceitful I don’t think but she was always so miserable.) She was one of those people who you asked whats up and they started telling you every single problem they had. It honestly depressed me when I was around her. It was definitely a one-sided friendship.

I mostly stayed friends with her because I felt bad; she didn’t really have any other friends. My family soon found out that her family was psycho (her sister was a pathological liar and her mom got sent to a mental hospital on multiple occasions. Her mom attacked the principal of Emma’s school, and got arrested for a few days, then sent to a metal hospital again. Shit was crazy.) We stopped going over there, 

Emma still wanted to talk to me though, and would text me nonstop. If I told her I was busy she’d ask how long I’d be and when she could text me again. She’d always ask to call me, and if I said ok then she’d want to stay on the phone for HOURS. Not even really talking. She didn’t really have anything to do, so I felt bad, but like I have stuff to do! 

Here’s one of our actual conversations over text:

E: hi what’s up

M: nothing. Hbu?

E: nothing. Can I call you?

M: sorry I have to take a shower.

E: ok. Will you be done in 15 minutes?

M: um maybe longer than that.

E: ok text me when you’re done.

(15 minutes later)

E: hi are you done with your shower?

E: lilypanda22???

E: lilypanda22 can I call you?? 

Seriously. Crazy. I need personal space. 

So eventually I stopped responding to her texts. She kept trying to contact me. Finally she stopped. A few months later she texted me and said “I got a new number, who is this?” I was stupid enough to tell her it was me, and the texts started again. I didn’t respond. She’d send me happy birthday texts, and I felt bad for not responding, but I knew that if I did it would get bad again. It escalated to her messaging my mom on Facebook, asking if she could call me. Wtf?

She goes to my high school, and I don’t see much of her because she’s in special ed classes. I feel bad, but I wasn’t comfortable with how she acted. She was so clingy, and constantly said I was her only friend. I don’t really regret cutting it off, but was I an asshole?"	Asshole	1	0

My sister played traveling volleyball for a place called “Up On Top” so I had to watch games for like 4-5 hours a day all weekend on every second weekend. It was boring and I had no one to talk to. Then I met Lacy, a girl who had an iPad just like me and played Minecraft so I made friends with her and we sat together at tournaments for a while. She had a friend Kate who sat with us every once in a while and watched us play. 

One tournament, I was in the hotel room on my Xbox when my mom asked if I wanted to go to the pool and that Lacy was going to be there. So I got dressed and met her by the pool. We chilled together and had fun for a few before her friend Kate came down and we all started playing tag.  Lacy was it and was chasing me. I was a really fast kid so she was having trouble catching me. I ran into this little nature walk type isle that went a little away from the pool and back, It was just about 45 feet long, then I jumped into the pool and looked back expecting to see her close but she wasn’t there. So I went back and saw her on the ground with her head in her hands crying with Kate trying to help her up. Then I saw that her knees were bleeding kinda badly. I ran over and asked what happened and Kate looked at me and said “your a jerk”then walked Lacy to her parents. The next time I saw Lacy I didn’t say sorry like some kind of idiot. I smiled and waved but she kinda ignored me and kept walking. And that was it.

That stuck with me till this day and haunts me with guilt and thinking of all the things I could of done different to not lose my closest friend.My sister moved to a different team and I never got to see her again.

c5mkmz	2019-06-26 06:56:17	tthrowaway2918	AITA for thinking my girlfriend is grieving too much over a turtle	"So my girlfriend’s pet turtle of 1 year recently died. She came back from a trip to discover a broken filter and her precious turtle floating upside down. It broke her heart because she feels at fault for not investing in better equipment, which could be true but honestly situations like these are unpredictable and could happen to anyone. She cried for hours on end the first day and it was hard to see her so upset.

Of course, I felt really bad and did my best to be there and comfort her. But it’s been a little over 2 weeks and she’s still very distraught about it all. Personally, I don’t think a person could ever develop that intense of a bond with a turtle simply because of the nature of animals like that. They’re not sociable or affectionate “pets”, if anything they’re pretty passive and unfulfilling in terms of reciprocating their owner’s love. Yet my girlfriend loved that smelly little thing with all her being; she was constantly talking about it and buying treats for it.

I helped her bury it in her yard because she refused to throw it away “like meaningless trash”. I thought it would give her closure and she would be past it by now, but she still talks about her turtle excessively, reminiscing on how special it was. True, for anxious creatures, her turtle was strangely comfortable around her. I think it’s because during the first few months of her getting it, she would hand wash the tank once a week(she couldn’t afford a big tank yet) and let him out on the grass so he probably became used to her presence. But she looks too deep into small things like this and sees it as an indication that her turtle loved her back and enjoyed her company, which is something I feel like you shouldn’t hope for or expect from undomesticated animals. 

I haven’t shared any of this with her because I don’t want to upset her or invalidate her feelings, but I do think she needs to get over it soon. It’s just not healthy to be so attached to something that wasn’t capable of caring about you to the same extent. I’m planning on slowly talking to her about it, but don’t know if that’s the right thing to do right now. There’s so many other things she should be focusing on like work and school but this has been the one and only thing on her mind."	Asshole	0	0

So here’s the thing, me and my husband are going on a trip together soon. It’s actually the very first trip we take together. He has a hard, manual labor job and very rarely has time off. And when he does it never matches mine, because I have a regular 9-5 job. 

We are both very excited about our first vacation together, since we didn’t even get to have a honeymoon. Thing is, my husband is insisting in contributing equally to the cost of the trip. 

He comes from a very poor background and is used to pretty much nothing and having to work his ass off his whole life for what he has. 
I admire this very very much, but we don’t live in those conditions anymore. I have a great job and I make really good money, so I am comfortable paying for a large percentage of the trip. 

For a bit of context on the trip: we live in Europe and we are planning on going to a small, European capital. The places I’m looking to book are not ridiculously expensive, just regular b&b’s somewhere in the city, with little to nothing included. Something simple because we don’t really need much. 

On my husbands budget, best we could afford would be something like a hostel with shared rooms and bathrooms. Which is not a bad place, but for a first husband and wife vacation I think I’d like a bit of privacy with him... 

I was thinking in telling him that I got a really good “advance purchase” deal and say that the price was much cheaper than what I am actually paying for. 

I don’t want my husband to feel bad about himself on something has little as money, I understand why he feels like this and that’s why I don’t want to insist in paying and make him feel like “he is living off of me” (his words). He contributes so much to the household and works so hard, I couldn’t care less about who makes more or less money because I know we are both very invested in each other. 

Also, it’s not like I’m putting us in debt or asking for loans. I have more than enough to afford this on my savings account. 

He’s the best in the world and he works so hard all the time, I think he deserves a nice vacation. So WIBTA if I lied about the cost of the trip?"	Asshole	0	0
c5mh5i	2019-06-26 06:43:58	FeltLikeIt1001	"AITA For Sleeping with A ""Friends"" Crush?"	"Let me preface this by saying I'm fairly sure I'm the asshole, but I'd like some external opinions.

&#x200B;

This happened several years ago, when I was a foolish young person. I had a friend, we'll call her Shannon. Shannon and I had a pretty toxic friendship, she would put me down constantly, and make me feel real shitty about myself. After the fact, I realised this was so she could maintain the power in our friendship (not to sound braggy, but I was better looking than her, and she repeatedly tried to make me believe I was ugly AF), but that's a different issue.

So, at some stage, Shannon got a crush on this guy, we'll call him Paul. Paul was older than either of us, and kind of cute. She had me message him all the time, pretending to be her, because she was too nervous to do it herself, and Paul and I had a lot of hobbies and interests in common, so by using me to message him, she could pretend to be interested too.

Flash forward a few weeks, Paul and I had met each other, and now chatted occasionally ourselves. He asked if I'd told Shannon what to say about his interests, and I admitted it.

Again, a few weeks later, Shannon is upset because Paul isn't messaging her much anymore. She knows he's still messaging me a lot. He tells me he knows she's into him, but he's not interested in her.

Paul and I meet up for coffee one day. One thing leads to another, and we end up hooking up. Multiple times.

I tell Shannon this, because I feel pretty bad. On one hand, I did really like him, and he seemed to like me back. On the other hand, she had a thing for him, and I wouldn't have met him otherwise.

Shannon loses her shit, cuts all contact with me, has a bunch of her other friends start ripping me to shreds though messages, and starts making posts about how no one can ever be trusted.

I kept sleeping with Paul for a bit, before that sort of fizzled out. Turns out he was a bit boring, tbh, and we weren't really after the same thing.

My only defense is that she was a shitty friend, had done something similar to me before (asked out the guy I was into), and that he wasn't at all interested in her anyway.

c5mh31	2019-06-26 06:43:42		AITA Breaking up with my ex because she had no interest being being a couple.	"So basically for 6 months I was dating a girl I worked with. She worked in a separate department than me and we never really seen each other unless we went out of our way to see each other. She seemed to really like me for some ungodly reason. Now I never gave her a reason to be upset with me or be mad at me. I hate confrontation or negative situations and I avoid them at all costs. I'm not a piece of shit, I don't cheat nor just be a dick or argue about anything. Pretty well kept guy in that regard. 

This girl never wanted to hang out, even if it was just go to one another's house. She had no interests besides make up and her guinea pigs. I've always tried to make an effort to hang out with her or try and do things but she always made an excuse. Our conversations were also minimal and lacking of any kind of emotional or romantic content. We only had sex a small hand full of times ( I'm not a very sexual kind of guy so that didn't effect me one bit.) She was nice and would buy me things randomly and go over board on holidays. But our relationship became mundane and had no life to it any longer. We were basically friends with a relationship title.

So about a month ago I decided it would be best for both of us to end things. So I tried to get her out of the house to do it in person and not like a dick head but she did not want to leave so I called her and did it in the nicest way possible. She took it the way I expected it too. It was kind of a cold response. She seemed to be upset and frustrated band tried to come up with something to be angry at me about but couldn't. I feel bad for letting it go on as long as it did. I would of done it sooner but she was having some medical issues and I didn't want to pile on more to that. I tried to be there for her and brighten her day as much as I could. 

A day after I broke things off she messaged me at 4 am telling me we couldn't talk any more. I also heard rumors coming from her that were odd and didn't make any sense from fellow colleagues at work. For example, she came over to my house one night dressed in lingerie and I put on a movie about Nazis. The movie I put on was The pianist because I really enjoy that movie and it was featured on Netflix at the time. If you're wondering I did end up banging her. I didn't try to fight it because I didn't want to make things worse nor did I have an interest to get back with her at this point.

c5mgtn	2019-06-26 06:42:39	AliceKingsly	AITA for feeling upset about my dad kicking me out of the room for other women I don't know while I visit him?	"Pretty long title. But I'm gonna get to the point. So, it's summer. I only visit my dad on breaks and it usually only lasts 1-2 weeks. Usually 1 week sometimes 2. This time its 2 weeks and it's almost time for me to go and he keeps kicking me out of the room we both sleep in so he can smoke/talk/whatever in his room with women while I either sit out on the stiff couch trying to watch tv on a tv that always acts iffy (As in it freezes/doesn't work whenever I try and change the movie/show or it'll just randomly freeze in the middle without me doing anything) OR I can sleep in the other room that smells like piss/poop and has a corner full of it because the dog in that room (chihuahua) uses the bathroom on pads. I can sleep on that stiff bed with no tv. 

I don't know these women and he's brought 2 different ones over. Both of which he's obviously cheating on because they both treat him like a boyfriend. He kicks me out during the day when they visit sometimes (this has happened about 2-3 times now on different days) and tonight he let one sleep over. The reason I'm upset is because that's the only room I find actually comfortable. It's freezing in all of the other rooms and its disturbing to think he may be sleeping with them in there while I'm out here. I only get to visit my dad for these short periods of time so I feel angry when he wastes it on these women. 
It's not like I visit him every week. 
Only on breaks. I told him I was upset because I was tired of constantly being kicked out of the room and he said I was selfish. He doesn't even care about my feelings on the matter. So I'm selfish for wanting to be in the only room that's comfortable for me when these women have perfectly good homes to go to? (He also visits them while he's out and has told me before that he goes to their houses as well.) So why do they need to come here only for me to be kicked out? 
And if he was REALLY only smoking why do I have to be kicked out? 
And the number of times I keep getting kicked out are only growing.
And I don't even know them.

Edit: Before people start throwing around things that aren't true. I GENUINELY thought I was wrong especially after he called me selfish. His words bothered me. I'm just looking for an outside opinion.

So to start off, my friends and I formed a board game club before we graduated high school so we can all stay in touch during college. It seemed like one of the only ways we would still be connected. My best friend(I’ll call by A), is also part of this group. She’s not that close to any of the other members, so she really only feels incentivized because I am part of it.

A couldn’t go and texted everyone in the group chat; my friend E, who’s basically the leader of the group, invited a friend of his to play. This led to A feeling left out, even though she already told us that she couldn’t go. She proceeded to get upset at E because she felt like she was being replaced. Not at all the case and I feel like it wasn’t that big of a deal; no matter what, she wasn’t able to go so why couldn’t someone else join us? 

Now we have another game day planned for tomorrow, A has work at 4, I have class until 2 and playing Dead of Winter which is a really long mf game. It takes 15 minutes to just set up and my friends most likely didn’t watch any how-tos on it. E and I tried to tell A that since she has work, we’re worried about the location for her. She began to get upset at us again about feeling left out and proceeded to tell me that she feels as if I don’t care about her and don’t understand her. I told her that I do, but I’m trying to be proactive not reactive and try to find a solution. But in all honesty, I’m being driven to the point of not caring. This club was supposed to be something fun and light hearted, not something to agonize over. Now it’s like she’s driving all of us apart from hanging out again from the negativity.

They do a lot of extra work (and I’ve had plenty of jobs in retail where they didn’t do that much work) and it’s really stressful.

A lot of people talk shit about each other, including the managers. It’s affecting my mental health. It’s getting to the point it’s affecting my job performance.

c5md8x	2019-06-26 06:29:52	MinecraftMagiMan	AITA my entire life? (reposted cause it was too long originally.)	"I'm copying one story from my original post that was too long, so hopefully it still makes sense. I'll probably end up posting each story I mentioned as separate posts in the future. For Now, just know that the others were similar to this in that it was problems with my dad and step mom.

So here's the background

I'm 17 years old and have to go back and forth from the school year living with my mother, to breaks (winter break, summer break, etc.), where I visit my alcoholic father and step mother, as Well as the step sibling who gets away with everything and pins blame onto me. All of these people during breaks seem to think I'm an asshole, whereas my family during school year will talk about things before jumping to conclusions.

Me, my sister, and my step mom's 2 kids (one of which is a half sibling. He's pretty nice compared to everyone else), as well as the step mom and father, were playing hide and seek in the dark inside the house. I had ended up getting caught along with my step mom and my father, so we were sitting on the couch waiting for the others to be found. They decided to mention about how when I was 8, I was afraid of ants. I said ""oh really? I don't remember that."" And started to laugh, as I was actually having some fun for once. Then my step mom decides to rant about how I ""never listen"" and that I should ""accept what they say without question."" I mention how I was listening to what they were saying, and was just trying to have some fun, and they go on how I ""always have to have the last word."" I say that I want to go to bed, just so that i don't start crying in front of everyone (as everyone was found by then). But NOPE. I have to spend time with family. And then they go on for a half hour about how I'm not the parent and how the parents' are always right. Then, they go to bed (even though they wanted me to stay up to play this game, but you know, they were drunk, so I guess they changed their mind.) I finally got to go to my room and decided to get on Reddit. Saw a few posts on this sub, decided I may as well post my problems here (hopefully this is how it's meant to be done).

Now, I've heard so often from them about how terrible I am, that I'm starting to question myself. I need to know, HAVE I BEEN THE ASSHOLE THIS ENTIRE TIME?!?! I'm really struggling with my emotions right now, so I may be overreacting over this all, but my father won't take me to a therapist for this, so this is all I have. But I still want to know who is in the wrong here.

Thank you to anyone who read this, and please let me know your thoughts."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Throughout the morning the chest pains started to get very severe to the point where I found it hard to breathe and move around. I messaged my manager (M),  just over an hour before my shift saying I really cannot make it to work because I have severe pain and need to get it checked out ASAP. 
M replies and says it’s okay and they will find someone to cover my shift, in my message I also apologised twice for the late notice and said I would have worked but was in severe pain and could not make it in. 
The next day M texted me and asked  if I was working my next rostered shift, I said that I am okay to work and got no reply. 
This morning I text M to speak about covering my SIL while she is on leave from work. M replies back with a very rude message that I will not be covering any shifts if I am going to let them know an hour beforehand that I can’t come in. I didn’t want to argue back so I just apologised again and told M that it won’t happen again.
I understand that I didn’t give enough notice but as the pains were becoming pretty severe during the morning, I had no choice but to put my health before my job. I feel as though M could have spoken to me when I called in sick and said that they didn’t appreciate my late notice, rather than leaving it for a few days and sending me a nasty message after I texted them. 

So does this make me the asshole in this situation?

Theres one cousin who just has it out for me (we’ll call her MG) and i have no idea why. MG has always despised anyone talking about me in a good way and always finds a way to bash me.

All of the cousins got together and planned the performance 3 weeks ago (MG decided not to show up) and everyone just needed to learn their parts (mind that MG’s mother said she wouldn’t be dancing because she is 6 m pregnant now). 

So today we were suppose to meet and put it together. MG decided to change the list and put herself in the front of the group, push me to the back and take most of my part out. I was upset between work and school i barely have time to practice the dance moves and learn the lyrics of the songs. So i said “okay you guys changed it but the day it was changed two weeks ago or whenever you could have messaged me and let me known at least” they started getting upset saying “who cares it’s just a performance just do it”. I said “i won’t be doing anything different besides from the list that was made when MG was not here and she is pregnant she needs to be careful. “

Then MG begins to show me attitude and she started to say “You should know your place and that we aren’t changing anything” So i said “Why don’t we just split it and have equal turns where you’re in the front half the time and then i am for the other half”.

 She then started saying “You’re acting childish and I don’t want to dance anymore” and I got frustrated i’m saying “Why can’t we just compromise and work together 50/50”, then she scoffs and says “Wipe that look off your face before i wreck it” i was astonished and said “No need to say you’re gonna wreck my face calm down” then she says “Don’t tell me to calm down I have so much dirt on you so shut the f**k up before i expose you bitch” knowing well enough she doesn’t have anything.

 At that point i’m like “Okay expose me let’s go” and she goes “Let me f**king wreck your face first” and after all that I got agitated and said “Alright come at me” by that point everyone told us to calm down. Even though i was speaking in a calm voice up until i said let’s go. 

Our aunt then said sit down and talk your differences out and she begins to say “I’m literally shaking right now you got all up in my face i won’t ever be speaking to you again”. I’m shocked and i say “I am willing to speak to you there’s no need to be scared i just want a compromise in the first place” as i stepped one foot forward, she says “ Step back I’m scared”.  At that point i just go quiet and hope no one thinks i’m a bad person because i just wanted to enjoy the wedding as a Family

Alberto and I have have been friends for 5 years. 
Kate and I would have been friends for 2 years this year.

Kate and I had a fall out after expressing my feelings for her and her not being straight forward about not liking me as more than a friend. This went on for like 5 months. I ignored the red flags. 

I found out through Kates ex friend that Kate is dating someone. Her ex friend only told me because they had a nasty fall out. 

Alberto knew Kate was dating someone and that she was keeping it a secret from me. Alberto says it was not his place to tell me and that if he had he would not have been a good friend to Kate. That made me feel shitty and told Alberto that him not telling me hurt me. 

Alberto and I make up and its water under the bridge.

Kate and I no longer hangout and neither did Alberto. 

But now Kate and Alberto are hanging out. 

I told Alberto I don't think that is cool seeing how this all unfolded.

I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life, meanwhile he’s always been thin. I’m actually at a pretty normal weight right now. He’s a meth head and living in some guys backyard four hours away, I haven’t seen him in two years and I’ve only contacted him once in those two years. He is VIOLENT. And calls my family day and night, nonstop, telling them all the ways he will kill them. He has four kids who I help raise because of his addiction. He hasn’t seen his kids in two years. He says he cares, but he doesn’t make an effort to get sober and see them, so who the fuck knows. I was an idiot and text him on Father’s Day that I love him and miss him. He was semi-nice for five minutes before blowing up on me and calling me a fat bitch (which he knows is a sensitive subject) so I blocked him. It really made me think though, because my boyfriend of five years calls me a fat pig every time he is angry. I felt guilty. I thought, why am I cutting my brother out of my life and not my boyfriend? Then, my brother called me tonight. We talked for ten minutes before he lost his shit and called me a fat bitch. I hung up and text him “you would know how fat or skinny I actually am if you had BOTHERED to text me in two years!!” and then I blocked him. AITA for that? Why do I let my boyfriend treat me like shit when I blocked out my brother for saying the same things? Should I block them both out of my life? What do I do?

c5m7en	2019-06-26 06:10:20	canttakethisstuff	AITA for wanting to cut ties with a roommate?	"I live with two other people, and have for a little over a year, and I am desperate to move out fully. One of my roommates has pretty heft depression and anxiety, and I have encouraged him for years to get help for it. The problem is he uses his mental illness like a crutch to act out (we are all 30 this year), and has point blank told me to my face he refuses to do anything to upkeep his mental health unless I will be with him when he sorts himself out. 

I know he needs the help for his mental state, and I do realize that it's not something I can blame him for, but he's relentless in his pursuit of me, even after I've tried multiple times to end any kind of romantic interludes with him. It's gotten so bad that I'm irrationally angry at him, constantly, and I don't want to be part of his problem, so I told both my roommates that I was going to stay with a family member for a while. The depressed roommate lost it, going on about how I'm abandoning him, and I hate him, that we'll never be friends again. 

He did this once before, and I moved across the country with him, only to loose everything I owned in a fire, including some expensive electronics that were never replaced. He didn't set the fire, but I was happy where I was, and I've told him I felt like he manipulated me into moving with him to which he even agreed. Now it feels like he's trying to do it again, even as he keeps saying he's trying to get better. 

He's convinced himself that it's temporary, and while I am still trying to be his friend and play in a weekly tabletop game with him, he needles at me to stay longer and longer with each visit, and every time I leave he wants to know when I'll be back, and when he can stay the night. I'm so tired of trying to navigate keeping him on his medicine and going to his doctor, and dealing with gently turning down his advances, and it's taking a toll on me. I barely eat, and I haven't slept well in months, unless I'm somewhere else.

So my family isnt the best. My older half sister is disowned by my mom. That means we cant talk to her or be nice to her at all. Its stupid but my older half sister abuses her daughter a lot. Yes we have had cas (childrens aid socitey) *sorry for the misspelling* and they wont do anything. 

That is the main reason she is disowned by my mom. Well anyway recently i have been thinking about christmas comming up and what to get my nieces and nephews.... My older half sister is pregnant with a second child and due in november. 

My mom doesnt want anything to do with her or the baby and is only getting my niece something for christmas and wants us to do the same. I no longer live with my mom, i live with my bf, im 26 years old and cant do anything without talking to my mom first. Its has always been her way or else we would be yelled at, made fun of, told to die or her favourite she would say "" if i knew this was how you would turn out, then i wish i never had any of yous."" She would make the other kids hate the one shes mad at. And we couldnt do anything against it or she would get worse..

This is the reason i dont want to go against her but if im buying gifts, why wouldnt in get my older half sister's new baby a gift. Its not the babys fauilt that its mom isnt the best.. 

Would i be the asshole if i listened to my mom and not got the baby a gift. I hate leaving a kid without gifts. But if my mom found out she would be pissed. I dont know what to do. My bf is cool with anything i do. He doesnt fault the baby either.

Susan has an anxiety disorder that mostly manifests in the fear that everyone the cares about will abandon her. I would say a good 70-85% of my friends are females, and the friend that I am closest to, with the exception of Susan and my brother, is another female who I'll call Lucy (13F). Lucy and I have similar interests, have a similar sense of humor, and Lucy is the only person I've hung out with outside of school with  besides Susan and my brother. One of the biggest things Susan's anxiety targets is that I will leave her for Lucy, no matter how much I know and tell her that that wont happen. Lucy and I are friends, but I will never loved her like Susan.
 Susan and I text almost every day, but most of the conversations start the same way, with either a nightmare Susan had, Susan needing reassurance I wont leave her, or Susan in a place that makes her uncomfortable. While I think I do a good job being patient with Susan, and while I truly love Susan and her personality, it feels like a chore to spend 15-30 minutes every time we talk discussing the same 3 things, over and over and over. I usually dont mind, but I have developed the habit of ignoring her texts when I'm not in the mood to do the same conversation as yesterday, and rarely I just want to lash out and tell her to get it through her head how irrational her anxiety usually is.

c5m58d	2019-06-26 06:03:06	infinitiffany	AITA for not acknowledging silent treatment?	"I interned in CO last year and got very close to a group of interns who are all from out of state. A couple stayed in CO while two of us are in the west coast and another two are now neighbors in the east coast. We all have a group chat that was very active and seemed to get along really well. 

The two people who live in the east coast proposed a trip to my city on a holiday weekend in the fall. Since I wouldn't need to travel or ask for any days off, I let the others plan the trip. The CO couple said they couldn't make it on that weekend. At this point, the couple was unsure whether they'd be staying in CO. So, in my head, I thought they wouldn't want to be buying plane tickets anyways. The three others make a separate group chat without CO couple, facetime without me, and eventually buy plane tickets.

CO girl finds out through an instagram story that plane tickets had been bought. She then full on gives all of us the silent treatment. She also starts subtweeting things like, ""in this house we always invite our friends"" and ""it's so hard when you give your all to your friends and never give it back."" I don't have twitter so I only saw screenshots of these tweets. She hasn't replied to anything in the group chat for weeks.

I mean I get that she's hurt, but I really don't agree with the passive aggressive silent treatment. It's very immature and I don't like that I'm expected to come begging for forgiveness. This is not the first time she's blown up a disagreement and expected one of us to give a big, dramatic apology. It's tiring.

If this happened to me, I wouldn't make it such a big deal! Four out of six is pretty good to me. The CO couples' schedule didn't match and the others were chasing the long weekend. Things like this happen all the time and there's always more holiday weekends or trips. 

I feel like I should apologize for not fighting hard enough to include them in the plans. It's been weeks, though, and I feel like it's too late to salvage this friendship. I also don't feel like reinforcing her behavior. Was my inaction really that punishable?

Time comes to go to sleep and I pull out an old mattress of mine (that is completely good to use) and I didn’t have any fitted sheets so I grabbed a clean sheet from the closet as well as a long pillow that stretched the length of the mattress. They complain about not giving them fitted sheets and I tell them it’s all I have, they still complain because the mattress is „old and ratted“. The thing they got most mad at was the fact that i did not lay out any blankets. It’s the hottest month of the year and my room tends to get extremely hot as we don’t run ac all the time, so I figured if they needed one they would ask. Anyway when I say they should grab the one we were just using downstairs, they get mad at me because I won’t grab it myself. Whatever I thought and I went and got it. I thought it was done and i went along with my business. While we were getting ready in the bathroom, my friend blows her nose, totally okay but I ask her to put it in the toilet and flush instead of the trash, she immediately puts it in the trash. When I explain that because the garbage is small and the used tissue tends to smear on the lid i would prefer it in the toilet. Once again she gets mad with my other friend joining in with her. I move on and as I get back to my room I hear them talking about everything I’m doing wrong. The final straw for me was when one of them asks for a extra pillow which I said was fine, I could only find two smaller pillows and she freaks out because they won’t hold her head up enough and that she neeeeeeds the one on my bed.

c5m3d2	2019-06-26 05:58:05	quackofattack	WIBTA if I stop fostering dogs	"I've been signed up as a foster with this organization since last year. I agreed a month ago to take a special dog who is older and has been in a kennel. After a solid 5 weekends of traveling, she was dropped off yesterday. We cut our vacation short because of a miscommunication and came home earlier than planned so that we could take her, as the woman (S) dropping her off was given the wrong time. 

S comes into the house, drops of the dog's supplies, and leaves within 5 minutes. The dog is super sweet, but skittish. All I know about her at this point is her age and that she had one biting incident years ago. She is coming from the countryside and doesn't like loud noises, so she hides in our bathroom immediately. She won't eat besides some treats, which is passed along to the Coordinator. C says to give her more treats in the food, and no blankets because she chews them. Dog goes to bed and is blocked from going into the living room with a doggy gate, so she only has access to bathroom and hallway.

Next day, dog is fine in same spot. Doesn't eat breakfast but takes more treats per C. I leave for work and plan to come back at 2PM to let dog out, due to event I'm running from 3-5. Dog is still blocked from leaving bathroom/hallway during this time.

A few hours later, S texts me that she will be picking the dog up at 4PM because her pending adoption was finalized. She knows about my event from 3-5 and insists I leave a key under the mat so she can get the dog to new home ASAP. I get delayed at work but rush back home at 2:30 with wet dog food to get dog to actually eat, let the dog out to pee, then the dog goes back into cozy bathroom spot. Since S is supposed to be there at 4PM, I leave at 2:45 and don't block dog in because I was in a rush to make my event.

Get home and no word from S on the adoption or confirmation that the dog is all set. I text C to ask if everything went according to plan as 4PM pickup changed to 5PM and then no info was sent after that. There is a blanket in the bathroom where the dog was, dragged from behind our couch.

Get a call from C almost 2 hours later. She said dog should not have been let loose in the house. She mentioned S was very concerned the day before about the clutter in our living room. Dog was not adopted and instead S lied so that she could get into the house to take the dog back to the kennel. She also sent C pictures/videos of our livingroom and backyard. C says the house is not safe for the dog due to the blanket/pillows, laundry in the basket, and dishes in the sink. She wants to send someone over to confirm we've done our laundry and dishes so that she can send us another dog in 2 weeks.

Should I just get over the lying and hope it doesn't happen again? The dog they want me to take is from a very similar situation. WIBTA if I tell her tomorrow that I'd rather find a new organization to work with?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

The problem is that when anybody else is talking he is _constantly_ making encouraging interjections. Yep, sure, wow, uh huh, of course, ah, really, good, well, right... It's not even at appropriate points in a conversation, just an unending stream of meaningless words.

At best this is distracting: I've lost my train of thought while I've been trying to explain important processes to him, and I've seen others do the same. At worst, it comes off condescending and rude. I'm pretty sure he doesn't mean it that way, I think he's genuinely trying to be encouraging, but it's like he learned it in a book, and sometimes a ""wow"" at the wrong time can seem sarcastic.

c5lyu3	2019-06-26 05:46:06	throwaway_98765-	AITA for refusing to share my photography?	"Throwaway because I don't care about karma, but I do want to know if what I did (or didn't do) makes me an asshole. I'm a little nervous but here goes.


About two months ago, I (19F) took a very nice photo of a tulip magnolia flower. I aligned it with some stickers on my wall of pink glittery stars and then highly edited it with this app, Snapseed. It took me about an hour to perfect this photo and now it's my background because of how well it turned out. I posted a screenshot on my Snapchat story because of a funny notification I wanted to joke about. This girl, who I do not even know, replied to my story.


Her: This is cute. Send it to me.
Me: Oh, it's a photo I took myself.
Her: Send it to me.


At that point I thought it through. I am skeptical of people on the internet, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to hand my photo out willy - nilly. So I took a minute to think and ask my friends' opinions on the matter. They haven't replied yet but in the time span it took for me to come to a decision she messaged me again. 


Her: So are you gonna send it?


For me, that was the nail in the coffin. I could be wrong here, after all it is just a photo, but I felt like she was being rude. So I replied. ""I don't think I am willing to, sorry. I worked really hard on that photo and I don't want to hand it out to just anyone, I apologize for the inconvenience."" She replied with a curt ""I was just gonna use it as my background photo."" but I left it at that.

So my mother has always had an insecurity when it comes to her power over me. She consistently makes a point of trying to stress her authority and make me feel ten centimeters tall in comparison. Think that whole ""I'm right and you're wrong, I'm big and you're small, and there's nothing you can do about it."" shit from Matilda and you've basically got it.

Well today we had an argument which took a huge turn from the actual subject matter and turned into stuff that I do that hurts her fee-fees. Most of it was petty shit that I'd heard countless times before (""it just crushes me when you snap at me in front of [sisters name]"" Oh yeah? That's probably because I'm tired of taking care of her (8 years old and autistic) for hours while you sit on your ass in front of the telly) but then she started going off about one thing that really got me fuming.

She started saying how disrespectful I am to her because I sometimes don't respond to her with yes/no ma'am even though I do to strangers. I say okay or yes or something similar. She said it hurts her feelings and I must just not respect her and blah blah blah. She also tried to make it seem like I've NEVER said it without her asking me to which is an absolute lie. I say it all the time, it's just that sometimes I dont think about it or it doesn't make sense in the context of the conversation. An example of this would be the time her and I were casually looking for a few pieces to my sisters toy, and she asked me if I had the wheel, to which I said yup. She went off on me then as well for not saying ma'am. Why the hell would I say ma'am then? It doesn't make sense to me.

She told me it makes her feel as though I think of us as equals. Truth be told, with all the shit shes done to me, I view our relationship more as unwilling roommates rather than mother and daughter. She also said that she always has and always will say ma'am to her mother. Another lie. She rarely does unless there's company over or when she's in trouble (lol).

Sooo reddit, what do you lot think? Am I an asshole for not doing so and thinking that its ridiculous of her to expect that of me every single time?

c5lxqk	2019-06-26 05:43:11		WIBTA for exposing my sister’s toxic behaviour towards her boyfriend?	"Hello all, this might be a bit of a long read.

For some background, I am (23F) and have been living with my sister for the entirety of my life.

To get into the problem, my sister (18F) and her boyfriend (20M) have been dating for about 10-11 months IIRC, and appear to be a very happy couple. But as someone who’s been in close quarters with the both of them for quite some time I’ve been exposed to a good degree of unhealthy situations they’ve encountered. I’m just going to throw some examples around here:

• She grew instantly irritated when I mentioned I  wanted to send a funny meme to her boyfriend, “Why _____? Why do you need to send it to ______?”

• I’ve caught her in multiple lies in regards to petty things. She will frequently pretend to know of certain books/games/channels in order to appease him. 

• She has thrown silent tantrums while him and I would be having a conversation. Him and I get along well since we have a few things in common, and because I’m aware my sister may not have the same interests (in the certain discussion him and I would be having) I would still try and include her in those conversations. When she showed disinterest, him and I continued to speak and as a result she would grow restless, passive aggressiveness would increase, cold one worded answers began to arise towards him and to myself until she would leave the room altogether to pout on her own, away from the two of us while silently scrolling through her phone.

• Her boyfriend and I ended up meeting at some point in person his and her relationship. He shared his frustration in her inability to accept wrongdoings, her sudden outbursts and hypocrisy, as well as her outward jealousy towards me speaking with him. I had originally wanted to let my sister know I’d be meeting and hanging out with him, but he stopped me and insisted not to tell her due to how angry she would be, and as a result him and I both lied on where we’d been and what we’d done the day of due to his fear of her reacting terribly to the entire encounter.

• As a result of what was mentioned above, him and I talk much less. He has even begged me to delete conversations on **my** phone that him and I have had because he doesn’t want her thinking we talk (he also mentioned she’s read through our conversations before out of paranoia I guess).

• Other miscellaneous things would be her adamancy in him being around her constantly (including convincing him to quit his old job and work with her at her known-to-be unfavourable workplace), and constant petty arguments. I could go on but I don’t think I will at this point.

WIBTA for telling my sister I know how controlling and toxic she is towards her boyfriend? And WIBTA for threatening to expose this to others we both know if she continues to act this way? 

There are important details I wish I could add, but the character limit is holding me back."		1	0
c5lx3b	2019-06-26 05:41:28	lesbiellen	AITA for not visiting my grandma?	"TLDR: My grandma makes comments about me being gay all the time\*.\* Whenever I try raise this with my parents or my brother they both brush it aside as 'harmless'. They think I'm being overly sensitive for getting upset (though never visibly) by what she says and that I should just suck it up. They want me to visit her often, and I don't have the energy for that.

She refers to other gay women as 'real lesbians' (implying that I am not), insists that being gay is a choice, refuses to mention me dating girls. She also makes comments about how I am going to 'steal' my brother's girlfriend (who I am a mentor for).  On top of that she keeps saying 'now that you have switched sides'. It's exhausting, and I have had too many arguments with her about how those things are harmful.

I know this is 100% my issue to sort out, but I can't get over her voting against gay marriage because of her claims that gay people don't deserve to get married. She swears she is okay with me being gay and says she has known for a long time, but it really feels like she resents me for being a lesbian. I tend not to use the word lesbian around her because it makes her uncomfortable.

Anyway, my family want to go  and visit her several times a month. She lives far away so we drive and stay there for one or two nights. I have already done this last weekend. I honestly don't mind seeing her, and I love her very much. I just don't have the emotional capacity to deal with those comments regularly. I really don't think I'm being an asshole but my family does.

"I’m in college, with my own room for sleeping, connected to a larger shared room for work connected to said manchilds room (also a student but at a different college). Just to give an idea of how bad it is, the guy is 25 and screams at video games until 2 am daily, doesn’t seem to care about anything, eats nothing but junk food, poor hygiene/social skills, no career before college, no money, shit grades and generally just very immature and making no effort to change. I’m basically the opposite, hard working, organised and extremely successful for my age. (19)

I genuinely cannot stand living with the guy even though his behaviour doesn’t really effect me, so have requested to management for a transfer. I felt a bit shitty doing this so asked friends from college their thoughts, PhD students overwhelmingly agreed I was in the right but undergrads were much more split, about 50/50 and one in particular said I was being nasty/a bully.

c5lwbt	2019-06-26 05:39:31	syndromebananaa	WIBTA for not wanting my little cousins near my stuff?	"so later this year my little cousins will be coming down for a visit, and in the past they've broken a lot of expensive things my brother or i had. well they or really anyone in our family when visiting they will either stay with my grandmother or get a hotel, well late last year my family moved in with my grandmother. and i have the room that a lot of people stayed in, however. i was told when we first moved in that the room was big enough to fit three beds. but in reality it can really only fit two, but i am not the only one who sleeps in my room. i have two large dogs about the size of a 5-9 year old child weight wise. 

but i am into drawing and painting, watercolor to anyone wondering. and i have a huion tablet, mix all the art stuff i own (probably close to 117-120 bucks worth) and i have a few kpop stuff, (one album, a poster, photo cards, a magazine, and a funko pop) and some stuff that cannot be replaced aka some stuff i got from fun times with friends and a realistic (creepy ish) native american doll. 

well every time they come for a visit if we brought anything we were told ""oh yeah they changed, it's safe"" or ""they aren't like they were! they won't brake anything!"" and we end up with something broken before they leave, all were from them playing to hard or not listening to the rules and go some place they aren't allowed and something gets broken. and they'll take stuff from you without asking, just rip it out of your hands. and the oldest is old enough to know not to behave like this. she's 11, i'm not THAT much older. like a few years, but my little brother is her age and he and all the kids i know who are that age don't act like that in fear of punishment, but these kids don't get punished for it other than ""hey we told you not to do that! now go watch TV or something"" 

so when i heard they were coming down to visit i asked to not have them in my room, like really come in at all. because i don't want anything broken, and i need a place to do homework and listen to music without hearing screaming from them playing.

c5lsf1	2019-06-26 05:29:13		AITA in getting in touch with a guyfriend (non romantic) immediately after a break up?	"Boyfriend and I of almost 2 years broke up because he didn’t think he could commit to the relationship anymore. His attitude over the past few weeks had changed and he did a lot of things to hurt me, not deliberately but probably due to the fact that he didn’t feel as strongly about me as before. I tried to persuade him to give us another go for an hour, but he didn’t change his mind.

This guyfriend in question was someone we had a lot of fights over throughout our relationship (although him and I never had an interest in each other and we were rarely in touch while I was in a relationship due to my bf absolutely hating it). He was also someone I turned to when we had a previous break up a month ago (also due to bf since he didn’t think he could commit) just to keep me company since I hated being lonely and alone with my thoughts.

So yesterday, after doing everything I could to get him to change my mind, I told him that I would be unblocking that guyfriend because I’d feel too sad otherwise. I game a lot and the guyfriend was someone I gamed with heaps and enjoyed playing with before my now ex got livid about it. I also did not have a lot of friends I could play with since I’d mostly been gaming with bf and his friends while we were dating. He said okay.

When I got home, I unblocked him and we were in the middle of a game with a couple of other random friends when I got a message from ex being furious, saying he couldn’t believe I’d do it so fast. I said I’d feel too sad and he said “go ahead, I’ll be the one feeling shit then.”

Fast forward to two days later to today, ex and I happened to get in touch to sort some things out and he told me that me hanging out with the guyfriend was almost all he could think about, and I felt so guilty. Am I really the asshole for doing what I did when he was the one who didn’t want the relationship anymore and I tried so hard to get him back? While we were going out, I believe I showed him who took priority in my life by blocking the guyfriend since it bothered ex so much. Should I have respected his decision to let me go before he hurt me more with his not being committed, and given each other some time before I contacted the guyfriend? 

Opinions from a third perspective would be much appreciated. Thank you!"		1	0

I’m (m) 18, and so is my girlfriend. We’ll both be freshman at different colleges this fall, so we’re trying to soak up as much of this summer as we can. Currently on most weekdays because of our work schedules, I usually don’t get to see her until about 10pm. The standard procedure is I go to her house after work, we hang out, then I leave. 

My mom has a curfew set for me for 1am which is fair. I’m not here to argue that. But she often gets mad that I’m over at somebody’s house so late, disturbing my girlfriend’s parents. Meanwhile her parents don’t give two shits about me being there and sleep and act as if I’m not there. I come home by 1am, yet my mother still yells at me for being at someone’s house so late. I often remind her that I could be much worse. I could be jobless and smoking weed 24/7 like my brother. But instead I work and then go see my girlfriend, who I usually just play cards or talk with. Not to mention, half the time we are just in some parking lot eating Taco Bell. 

Am I the asshole? Is there something I could be doing better? I understand her main point of not wanting to overstay my welcome, but if her parents had a problem with it, they’d tell me or at the very least tell my girlfriend (they’ve talked to me before when I was doing something they didn’t like). In my eyes, she’s being ridiculous and ruining my summer with my girlfriend."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5lpbf	2019-06-26 05:21:00		WIBTA If I Told My FWB I Don't Want Her To Go On A Date With Another Guy?	"This is a bit complicated. 

Recently got out of a relationship that left me with a few fucked up issues regarding relationships. It was a long relationship and so I wanted to be single mainly because I'm lazy as fuck and I don't want to continue doing the typical relationship shit like texting all the time and having the responsibility of commitment to someone. 

After my break up I started a FWB relationship with a friend of mine who to be honest would pretty much be the perfect girl for me if it weren't for the fact that I have this idea that I have to be single because I just got out of a relationship. 

I've been trying to keep my distance from my FWB because it's my way to assure that I'm not going to grow strong feelings for her, but today she texted me and told me she was going on a date with someone on Friday and to be fucking honest that did not feel good. I thought I would be okay with it but it bothered me more than I thought it would. 

I told my FWB that I respected her decision to go on the date but the more I thought about it throughout the day, the more it bothered me that she's going out on a date with another dude. 

I don't know if I should tell her that it bothers me and that I would not want her to go. My idea is to say something like *""I respect that you're going because we're not in a relationship, but I will admit that I didn't realize it would bother me until you told me about it.""* 

I also thought about just plain out telling her I don't want her to go or that I'm jealous about it. But then I also know that it is not fair. Part of me knows I shouldn't care because she's not my girlfriend and I really didn't think I would care until I started to imagine the idea of her having fun with another guy and it sort of made me feel off about it. But at the same time, I don't know if I'm ready to go into another relationship so soon after the end of my last.

c5lpau	2019-06-26 05:20:57	500daystolive	AITA for not telling my wife that I am dying?	"Male, 31 here. For the past 15 years, I’ve been dealing with a medical condition that requires constant medication and consistent doctor’s visits. I had always been projected to live until 50-60ish, however, a recent complication has cut that down to 12 months, 16 at best. In about 10 months, my condition should start getting a lot worse. After 12 months, I’ll essentially be living in the hospital.

I am married of 4 years (no kids). I haven’t had the heart to tell my wife the news. I don’t even know how. We always knew I’d die younger than I wanted to, but we never expected it to be this soon.

As much as I know I should tell my wife, I don’t want my last year to be plagued with an impending doom.

My wife and I have always talked about living abroad somewhere, maybe Australia, but we’ve never found the time or money to do so. I’ve been saving up to go to graduate school, however, I don’t see much point in that now.

So here’s my idea: take some of that money, and take my wife to Australia for a few months, and enjoy the time together. I have a job I can work remotely from anywhere, and she has a job that she can easily find work anywhere. We can work part-time, and enjoy our time together. When we get back, or maybe towards the end of it, I will break the news to her. I just wouldn’t want the trip to be ruined for us by constant reminders of me dying. I know my wife, and she’s very emotional - to the point where I feel like she will be crying everyday and not enjoying herself. I want this memory to be a good one for her, and not plagued by my time ticking down.

AITA for putting off telling her I am dying?

Note: I have life insurance that will take care of her, so I am not too worried about spending this money now on this trip. And I plan on talking to her about a sperm bank, just in case she decides she wants my kids in the future, as well as premised birthday cards and other things for her to have."	Asshole	0	0

They came to us in Sept 2016 but we just got guardianship Feb 2019. His grades started declining, and he was doing less and less around the home (his chores), and he just wanted to keep making arguments. 
Well, this past month he has now gotten physical. He is accusing us of abuse, neglect, and spreading this all over (I won't go too far in to details because then this post would be 3 years long). We have had a slew of police officers, social workers, therapists, even a behavioural analyst speak with my brother and they all agree he is lying and seeking attention, or he might possibly have some mental issues. 
I am so tired, honestly. I know 26 year olds shouldn't be raising teenagers for a reason, but I have done my damndest to try and always do the right thing so they have a better childhood than me and 24 yo sister had. 
I really don't want him to come back home, he is a danger to the family, and I do not think he will do anything to change. 
But I feel like an asshole because when I think of how life could be without him there threatening and stirring the pot, I feel happy because it will finally be calm and drama free. I want him to change, I want to want him to be a part of the family but not like this. 
So, am I the asshole for giving up and not wanting him in my home until he decides to change?




Edit for anybody who might be interested. Today we met with a social worker and others and they decided to take brother in to protective custody to try and help and luckily they did not take 13 to sister.

c5lk1p	2019-06-26 05:07:28	birdwoman91	AITA for going with a group of friends to the pub that my other friend works at who is the ex of one of those friends, when she was not working that night.	"  

Some background because I feel like the context is relevant. So I have this friend, let’s call him Brad. I’ve known him for 12 years and we have been really good mates for about 8 of those. He is my Husbands best friend. About 3 1/2 years ago he started dating Katie. About a year or so into their relationship Katie and I became quite close friends after I went through some stuff. 

Roughly 18 months ago Katie and Brad broke up. It was an awful break up. Brad was a bit of a dick, not intentionally. He’s just quite a selfish person in general. I tried my best to support Katie through the whole thing. She took it really hard, completely heartbroken. It was a little tricky logistically managing both their friendships after the breakup, but my husband and I didn’t want to lose Katie so we persevered when both of them were annoyed at us at different points for not being invited to certain things or not being able to attend things due to being with the other etc.  

Fast forward to about a month ago. It was Brads 30th Birthday. We spent the majority of the night at a pub that he had booked the function room out for. When it closed at 12 we spent a good 45 minutes trying to find another pub that was both open, & would let us all in (group of 8) & the city we live in is notoriously strict on drunkenness and most of us had been drinking for 6 + hours. After getting declined from 4 different establishments it was decided that we would try this pub that Katie works at as a last resort, check first if she is there, and if not try to go in. She wasn’t there. We all by some miracle got let in and all had a few drinks before going home. 

Last week I had plans with Katie and my other friend (who was also present at the 30th & at Katie’s pub that night). We had a couple of drinks and were seemingly having a nice time. Then, right before I was about to leave she unloaded on me. A lot of things were said, but to summarise I am a terrible friend and I should never have allowed Brad (and group) to go into “her” pub. According to her, I should have put a stop to it all and the fact that I didn’t is “fucked up”. She was FURIOUS. According to her, checking that she wasn’t there first made it worse.

I apologised profusely. I told her that I really didn’t think it would be an issue which she would not accept. She said I “should have known” that it would not be ok. I continued to apologise and tell her it wouldn’t happen again.

c5lh87	2019-06-26 05:00:36		AITA for being upset that my boyfriend can't make it to a family event?	"Firstly, I'll give some background info. Back in March my cousin asked if I would be one of her bridesmaids in her upcoming wedding and I of course said yes. I had known about the wedding prior to this, but this is also when she gave out the date, time and address of the venue. My boyfriend and I had been dating for around 5 months at that point and I thought that bringing him as my date to the wedding would be a great chance for him to finally meet the rest of family, and he was totally down for it. So I asked my cousin if it would be alright to bring my boyfriend as a plus one, but she said that she wasn't sure as they were going to have a small wedding. I told her that it was alright and I completely understood. Then by mid April, she contacted me and said that they had enough room for a few extra guests due to the RVSPs and I would be able to bring my boyfriend! 

&#x200B;

I let my boyfriend know that he'd be able to come and so my cousin got his name, took his dinner order and set his spot at a table with my immediate family. He genuinely seemed interested in going and since then we had been making plans about who would be driving, when he is spending the night, his outfit etc. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today and my boyfriend texted me this morning saying that he won't be able to come to the wedding anymore because he was not able to book the day off. The shift switch he tried with another coworker was not approved by management. Normally I would understand this situation but the wedding is in 4 DAYS. He explained that because he started this new government job in the beginning of June, his hours were hard to manage. But he had known about the wedding for almost two months... and there was no way at all to speak to his management about specifically not working this day? 

&#x200B;

I know his new job is strict and requires dedication. But it's the fact that this is a last minute change to the wedding and now I have to explain to my family why there is an empty seat where my date is supposed to be who had already RSVP'd almost 2 months ago. And also I feel bad now that I have to explain this situation to my cousin. She had made an accommodation for him to come because I really wanted him to, as did the rest of my family, and now he's not even going. I'm not trying to be upset at him because it's not really his fault but I am, I just felt like there was more he could do to book this day off, even if his job is this demanding (am i wrong tho?). This honestly adds to the stress I already have about the wedding.  

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm justified in being upset, but he says that I""m overreacting and that this is just one instance where he wasn't able to come to something - expect this 'something' is pretty important to me and my family and not just some dinner we're having together.  AITA?"		1	0

c5lg4u	2019-06-26 04:57:42		AITA for wanting a decent first car?	"I'm about to turn 17, and i finally realized i need a drivers license and a car to do anything in life really. My parents are very stubborn an insist that their ideas are always more pratical than mine, so therefore, they are always right.

I live in a very small town, which only has about 3 or so places to actually work. So, like many would assume, all the people in town try to work at those places. That means i cant get a job nearby without making myself a victim of the harsh sun by mowing lawns, or dealing with bratty kids. Neither of those sound at all in my capabilities because A) i am an extremely weak teenage girl and pushing a push-mower is actually quite hard for me, and B) i absolutely hate childern. I will avoid them at all costs, whether they are nice and quiet or not.

I cant get my parents to understand that to get a job, i need a drivers license and a car to drive so i can go to one of the nearby towns and work, as the two closest towns within walking distance would take 2-3 hours for a one way trip from my house.

Anyways, im currently working on my 50 hours with my drivers permit and im looking at cars with my father all the time. He says he likes it when i show him what i like because its one of the only things we can bond from. 

Just the other day, my father got a new car. ( a subaru. Our family likes them alot.) he made me back it up in our lawn so he could get a few nice pictures next to it. Anyways, so i get in this thing, and adjust the seat to the highest point it can go (because im short) and i still cant see thtough the back window, so i already dont like this thing, but i manage to back it up, and unadjust the seat so my father could get in later. After the few pictures, my father, mother, and i, get in the new subaru and take it for a spin around town. Mom asks me if i like it and i tell her my honest opinions because i dont want to lie about liking it. I say it is a little boxy and not my style at all, although its a beautiful car, i just dont like it.

This makes my mother explode on me. I didnt mean to upset her or come off as ""high maintenance"" according to her, but i really dont like cars that are boxy in the back, especially ones i cant see out of. I like uniqueness in a car, and believe that a car has to fit the person who drives it or else they wont care about it as much as someone who loves their car would. Mom believes that i am demanding my dream car, which i am not. (im looking at subarus to keep them happy, with everything my father wants on it, and under 3,000$, when my dream car would be a 62,000$ imported car from Australia.) i really feel like im being as reasonable as i can be, and trying to comply with everyrhing my father wants for a future car for me, but i still want a car that i like.

c5l9q7	2019-06-26 04:41:23	userlame124	WIBTA if I refused to buy a cookie with a free cookie?	"This happened a while ago. My friends went inside a fancy bakery to buy something and I decided to go in with then to see what they were offering (even though I had no intention of buying anything). I was just having a look at the cookies (they looked delicious), minding my own business, when the worker there asks me if I want a free cookie. Ofcourse, I was surprised since these cookies are $4 each but I couldn't say no to free cookie.

The worker asked me to choose a cookie from their selection. I picked one and they put it in a bag and gave it to me. I was caught off guard when they followed up with ""what cookie would you like to buy?"". At this point I didn't know whether to just say no and look really bad after accepting a free cookie, or to just bite the bullet and buy one (im a broke  student). I chose the latter and just hesitantly picked a random cookie to buy.

I felt like they used sneaky tactics to pressure me into buying something I didn't want and i was kind of upset about that. I've always wondered if I was in the wrong for taking the free cookie in the first place, or should I have just said no to buying one after they gave me a free cookie?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c5l9p4	2019-06-26 04:41:20	santos987	WIBTA for choosing my best friend over my sibling in my wedding.	"So my best friend and I have been friends since the 6th grade when we were only eleven. Honestly at this point she’s a sister to me, of everyone in her family I’m her closest confidant and I know her best. She tells me literally everything, and we’re known to other people as a “duo” or “package deal”.  Then there’s my older sister, my only sibling, who technically speaking knows ME best, all my best and ugly sides, she knows them. 

Obviously we’ve been through some shit together, we’re family. But some years ago we had a big falling out, our only and biggest fight because I was excited to buy my best friend souvenirs from Portugal but I didn’t get my sister anything because I figured she’s ON this trip to Portugal, she can just get whatever she wants from there herself. She blew up on me saying I all I care about is my best friend and that I don’t do anything like that for her. We didn’t speak to each the whole trip and I tried to justify it in my head but I couldn’t stop feeling guilty. 

We later made up and everything was back to normal for the most part. Now she’s nothing but polite to my best friend and all but I always get the feeling that she secretly can’t stand her and I feel like I can’t talk about my best friend to her because immediately she gets quiet. 

I also feel like she’s a little envious because she’s never really had a best friend of her own. Any girl she’s gotten close to ends up backstabbing her or it becomes a short term friendship and nothing stable. She has her own friends and all but she doesn’t have a bestfriend that she tells everything to, the only person closest to that is me. 

THIS is where my problem comes in. I was recently engaged and I have to choose a maid of honor. My sister got married two years ago and she chose me to be her maid of honor, a year later my best friend also got married and she too chose me to be her maid of honor as well. Of course I was deeply honored to be chosen by both of them. 

So now I’M the one getting married and have to choose a maid of honor. This decision is giving me so much anxiety because I want to choose my best friend but I also don’t want to hurt my sister. I don’t know what to do

TLDR: I’m getting married and I don’t know who to choose to be my maid of honor."	No A-holes here	0	0

c5l4ag	2019-06-26 04:27:40	InternetIntroverts	WIBTA if I didn’t pay for my sisters college tuition after she got kicked out?	"So my little sister just turned 18 and got kicked out by our father. We knew this was coming and we had made plans that she would move in with my husband and I in New York. I don’t speak to my father due to things in our past but he isn’t a good person.

She was originally planning to attend NYU was a freshman in fall and was going to stay in the dorms. She recently found out that he pulled all of his tax information from her FAFSA so she gets no financial aid and can no longer afford NYU. This left her with a few options, take out a student loan, attend a New York community college or work for a year and then attend college.

In order to take out the loan, she needs a co-signer and that would have to be me. I get nervous about that because I don’t want my credit to be affected by this. She would be pushing the community college deadline but there are a few with rolling admissions. She would earn her associates or even go for just her general Ed’s for a more affordable price. Or she could work, save up and live with us for the year till next year.

My husband, I and her sat down and had a discussion and she asked us if we would be willing to take the loan for her college. She also asked if we could co-sign the NYU loan. I was immediately apprehensive because it just doesn’t seem like a good idea especially due to how expensive NYU is. I attended NYU on a full scholarship which is how I could afford it. She said that I got to attend and she should be allowed to as well. 

I told her my husband and I would talk about it privately. We had a long discussion and had another meeting with her. We decided that we would take the loan for CC since it’s very affordable or we would let her live with us for free if she worked for a year. We decided NYU just wasn’t doable. 

We explained the reason why which was last week our 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with B-Cell ALL Leukemia. We now have chemo, hospital stays, etc.. and we have our loans paid off and have no loans or debt. We didn’t want to have student loans to worry about as well.

She got mad at us and said it wasn’t fair that we got to live her dream but she didn’t get a chance to her. We tried to explain it to her and even suggested deferring for one year. She’s living with us free of charge, free food, etc.. and I thought we were doing enlighten. She isn’t speaking to us anymore and I feel guilty because of all this. 

So WIBTA if we refuse to take the loan?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5l3r8	2019-06-26 04:26:22	bubs57	AITA for not wanting to go to the show early?	"Agreed many months ago to see a band with a friend at a large music festival.  The festival hosts some large name
bands (we're planning to see Walk the Moon) on the ""free"" stages - entry to the festival is $23, no additional cost for the free stages.

Friend is currently unemployed.  I work for a school and have summers off, though I pick up a few hours here and there over the summer.

Band starts at 10pm.  Friend indicates to me she'd like to arrive before 3pm to get in for $3.  There's nobody she wants to see before 10pm.  It's supposed to be 80 degrees.

I've got a 3 year old and 1 year old at home, and need to find a sitter from the time we leave until my husband gets home from work.

Food and drink prices are comparable to a state fair or baseball game.  Personally I feel going 7 hours before the band starts is not worth it - you'll end up spending that much on food and drink (no carry ins, and they do check).

Here's where the iffy part starts for me:  i got asked to cover something at the equivalent of a summer job, some of the minimal summer hours.  I'd be out of there by 8.  Friend doesn't like driving in the city, so i was going to drive.  We'd be on the road, parked, and at the stage by 9.  I offered to cover friend's ticket.

Checked with friend ... she really, really wants to be at the stage by 6pm for the 10pm show.  Now, the stages DO get crowded for larger names.  Personally, I'm just as happy being waaaay in the back, and not crowded in closer to the band.  Am I a jerk for wanting to get some hours in and go to the show later - still arriving an hour before show time?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c5l2az	2019-06-26 04:22:45	allyisspicy	AITA for telling my friend not to lie about monster high dolls to her mom?	"Okay, so this might sound weird, but my friend, who we will call ""UG"" for using girl. 

UG had always been someone to take advantage of people, which isn't really part of this story, but it's important to know where I'm coming from. She has used me and some others for weed, and more people for money. (I've been clean for about five months btw!!) 

She came to my lunch table with a weird predicament.   UG had told us that she gave these dolls TWO YEARS ago to this guy. We will call him ""John"". 

UG: Yeah, I gave then away, but my mom wants to sell then and I need them back. Hey, OP, I know you are friends with John.. can you ask him to give them back to me?
Me: Oh, of course. I can ask for you.  
UG: Thanks!!
Me: I cant promise you'll get them back tho dude. 
UG: At least try!! I'm embarrassed to go and ask him for the dolls. 
Me: okay I will. 

And I did.  John had then told me that UG stopped talking to him about two years ago, and even lied to him about having a party? Which I wasn't surprised. 

Me: Hey John, You know UG right?
John: Of course.  I don't like her though. She was super mean to me and then stopped talking to me suddenly.  
Me: oh,, that sucks. Like really, dude man, but I get. She did that to me after I stopped letting her get high at my house.  
John: Yeah, I know.  Anyways, why do you bring her up?
Me: oh she wants her... m o n s t e r h i gh dolls back from two years ago because she cant tell her mom that she doesnt have them anymore.  

John laughed. 

John: Yeah, I'm not giving them back, she literally has not talked to me for two years. I don't care how much she needs them back lol
Me: yeah, I didnt think you would.  

So, I went with UG the next with the news. She was pissed at ME for not getting him to give the dolls back. I told her just to tell her mom she doesnt have them, but that pissed her off more.  

UG: YOU JUST DONT UNDERSTAND  ! ! MY MOM,, WILL GROUND ME!!1! (most UG would have to do was prolly vacuum or do the dishes more lol)
Me: Yeah, but you obviously are not getting them back. It's better to tell her the truth now, instead of her finding out herself dude. 
UG's mind starts turning. 
UG: I'll just apologize to John and then he will give them back. 
Me: UG, its not a good idea. He won't. I'm just being honest with you.  
UG: I can at least try lol.


So, she did. John still denied her the fucking dolls. I would too.

She was really mad at me for not helping her get those dolls back. But cmon. They are dolls. That YOU gave away two years ago, and you cant expect them back. This lasted for about two MONTHS. It was too the point where I was so dine hearing her shit on this guy for not giving her dolls back, that I told get off. John is my friend, and she just, ripped into him. 
She talked about how he was being selfish and it was stupid for him not to give them back to her, and all. I told her that she needs to grow a pair and tell her mom that she just doesnt have them. She never did.  And she never ended up getting in trouble with her mom."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c5l0s4	2019-06-26 04:19:06		AITA for expecting my drinks to be paid for on my 21st bday?	"Based on the title I’m totally TA but context is necessary. 

I’m going out with friends for my 21st in 2 weeks. I’m hosting at my apartment but we plan on going out all weekend (like they cleared their schedule for the weekend). They’ve all (6 of them) been 21 for a few months now and have been dying for me to turn 21 forever so I can finally join them. 

Anyway I’m the last to turn 21 to drink and for 2 of their 21st bdays (I wasn’t there for the other 4, new friend group) the friends seemed to mostly pay for their drinks. But I wasn’t entirely sure because they were vague on details (not on purpose they were just hungover) and they had “”””friends”””” aka creepy guys at the bar paying for the bday girls drinks as well. So I never got to hear the full story of who footed the bill. 

I’m kinda broke and I can put some money aside to pay for myself if I need to (though it’ll be difficult) but I can’t pay for EVERYONE and I feel like based on past experiences our friend group has all spilt the bill. This is a new ish friend group and I’m worried to rock the boat by asking up front who’s gonna pay, hence why I want some judgement. If I’m TA I’ll absolutely set some money aside for myself and maybe to treat everyone to one night. But if not maybe I’ll just have money ready and not bring it up at all? I know I should communicate. I’m just worried about fucking up my new ish friend group. I’ve never been to a 21st bday so idk what to expect. Also for more context, when we’re drinking in a place where we won’t be carded we all pay equally (me included) but sometimes one of us will by drinks for everyone - it’s really random hence why I have no precedent. 

I’m new ish to this friend group and I feel incredibly uncomfortable to just ask straight up “who’s paying.” Based on their supposed past actions with others bdays and their impatience/excitement with me *finally* turning 21 I would think they’d be happy to pay at least some of it, but I’m also supplying my families rental house for the weekend and I’m supplying transportation (though my cousin as a DD). So before I ask my friends and make an ass of myself, AITA for assuming they’ll cover me for my birthday? I can really see both sides so I’m not too sure"		1	0

I rarely get to see this friend because she lives a few hours away, so I agreed to go so we could hang out. The wedding is about 8+ hours away from my house (6+ from her's) and was going to be a 6 day commitment in terms of travel and staying up there. My friend was going to pick me up, I'd stay at her house one night, and then we'd go.

I was supposed to go to her house tomorrow, but I cancelled the whole thing. My mom was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, and I have an anxiety disorder as well, so ultimately it's just built up into severe anxiety over leaving. My friend was accommodating to try to make the trip as short as possible, but ultimately I just don't feel like I can go.

She's now going alone. I told her I would still pay for my half of the airbnb, and I apologized over and over, but I feel so guilty. I had to skip the last few times I was going to see her (over the course of half a year), two times from getting the flu, and very recently because a family member died (I had anxiety the day I was going to go and cancelled because I felt like something bad would happen. Next day I find out my grandmother died), so I've been fairly flakey. We also haven't been able to to talk as much because of work and school.

She said she wouldn't be angry if I didn't go, just disappointed. It took me a long time to decide, and I ultimately decided my anxiety was too much and said I would stay home. I mentioned my worry that she wouldn't want to be my friend anymore (a few years back she hinted at not being my friend anymore for not talking as much) or was actually angry with me, but she stopped even looking at my messages once I said I wasn't going. I'm just afraid I've been too awful. I know iata in this situation in some regard, but I don't know if I did the wrong thing.

On May 5th, 2016, my mom picked my sister and I up early from school and took us to a hotel room where we stayed for a few nights. My grandpa flew in from Virginia on the sixth and we then went to my friends grandparents house a few cities over.

After that my mom grabbed as much of our belongings as she could before we traveled to Virginia where family was.

For custody reasons, my sister and I Skype my father on Sundays and Thursdays and visit Texas with our mom for a week every summer.

I have just learned that I can refuse to go and I despise my father, so I want to not go. The problem is, my sister LOVES my dad. Since she was only seven when we left, she doesn’t remember much. She was always a daddy’s girl, and holds him on a pedestal.

My mom won’t let my sister go alone with him if I’m not with her at all times, so I’m really the deciding factor on whether or not we take a twelve hour miserable car trip to see someone I dislike with a passion so we can hang out with him during the day for a week.

I REALLY don’t want to go, but it would crush my sister if we don’t. I don’t know what to do. so reddit, WIBTA if i decide not to go to my fathers house this summer?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c5ku93	2019-06-26 04:03:35		AITA For Telling Bf Watching Porn Is Emotional Cheating?	This is my first post and I just want it first to be clear that I don’t mind my boyfriend watches porn. I have no problem with it but it has been a recurrent problem that I always catch his search history. The first 15 to 20 times I have caught him we have talked about it and I’ve made it clear I don’t feel comfortable with him doing it while we live together, especially because he is so secret and continues to lie about it when I give him the chance to tell me if he has when I ask. I have started to think he has a problem with it. As a woman I also watch it but am not secretive and tell him that same day if I have. I have been extremely open about it in hopes that he is too. It’s also a problem for me because when he watches it he loses all intimacy with me and I do have trauma around porn in general. Last talk that we had about it I had made it extremely clear that the next time I catch his search history again it will be considered (emotional) cheating. He understood very well. Recently caught him again and ended in a huge fight. I have told him multiple times this will end in me leaving him but it has been difficult since we have a kid together. He does not consider to be in the wrong and has not made it clear he’s remorseful about it. So AITA or being over dramatic?		1	0

c5ksq6	2019-06-26 04:00:03	holymilked	AITA for not giving my ex my iCloud password?	"So, I just broke up with my ex (we're both 17) today. A couple weeks ago, we used an old iPhone 5c of his to fake my location as i didn't want to jailbreak my new phone. Teenagers, sneaking out, Life360, all that jazz.

Well, stupid me forgot to sign out before breaking up. I understand that part's on me, but I do not want him on there at ALL. My iCloud is my most valuable password and I've always been very protective over my passwords and accounts. So, I asked him nicely to try to sign out for me, but he was prompted for my password. He even sent a video. He tried factory reset, just signing out of iCloud, everything, and I was not going to give him my password.

So, I decided I'd temporarily change it, give him the changed one, and then change it to my usual. On my way to do that, I saw that changing the password could sign me out of all devices, so I chose that option. I told him what I did and he was only prompted for my password even further, which meant his phone was basically softlocked.

I don't feel obligated to give him my password or change it again. I want to be done with this relationship. He has other things he can do to reset it if he wants to use this phone so badly and said so himself. Also, he just got a new android and wasn't planning on touching the 5c ever again. I don't know why it's suddenly such a big deal now even though he hasn't used it and didn't plan on it. It barely functioned before.

Anyways, now he's utterly pissed and wants me to drive to his house to put in the password or give it to him over text. AITA for not doing so?"	Asshole	0	0
