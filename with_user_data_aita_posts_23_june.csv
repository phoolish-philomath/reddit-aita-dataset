c4hvyt	2019-06-24 03:54:48	MissKiruna	AITA for not helping out a friend?	"So this has been bugging me.
My friend Fatima has been in my life for over 20 years. We grew up together and have been close since we were kids.
But she continues to do unsavory shit. Such as losing custody of her kids, getting in trouble with the law, gambling, getting caught jacking men off in public, etc. 
Her life has become a total shit show.
In the past 3 years, she has violent mood swings, her teeth have begun to rot, and I suspect something is up because she was never like this until she got involved with a very awful man. 
Recently Fatima lost her money due to getting involved in a pyramid scheme.
She is now in debt.
She has spent money she doesn't even have. 
Now, I had given Fatima some money in the past for groceries.
I also set her up a consultation with a lawyer due to her legal troubles . (of course she never showed up.)
But Fatima was on the phone tearfully pleading with me to save her finances.
I make 3 times what she makes at her job.
But I have 8 mouths to feed in my household and often struggle to make myself a priority.
Fatima begged me to create her a gofundme.
But I can't bring myself to do this. I always feel a gofundme is for kids with cancer needing treatment, or starving families, etc.
I also can't afford to give Fatima $1870.78 to cover her debt.
She asked me to solicit donations for her online from our friends.
I said no and now she says she is hurt.

I feel like an asshole but I feel I can't help her."	Not the A-hole	0	0	390.0	27.0	0.0	0.0
c4hvt6	2019-06-24 03:54:18	GlutenMakesMePoop69	AITA or being weird/creepy for asking a personal trainer to use their paper towel to wipe down a machine they wanted to use after they've wiped theirs down?	"So the other day I was working out and using a machine, there was a personal trainer (PT) with her client on the machine next to me. As I was finishing up my last set the PT looked over and asked if I was almost done because they need to use the machine I was on. I told her ""yeah no problem I need the machine you are using anyways so we can just switch, give me a second I'll wipe it down for you"". So I walk over to the cleaning station grab the spray bottle and realize there was no paper towels left. I see that she has just finished wiping down the machine they were using and still has her paper towel so I walk over and ask ""is it cool if I just use your paper towel there was none left in the machine"". PT ""Are you kidding me!?"" With a super dirty look. Me ""no... There's none left right there is it really that big of a deal if I just use it quick?"" PT ""wow I can't believe this, it's just super weird, I had to walk across the gym to the other cleaning station so why can't you?"" Me ""ahh I can, I just didn't think it was a big deal and was trying to clean the machine quick so you can use it, is it really that big of a deal?"" PT ""yes it is"" rolls her eyes and hands me the paper towel anyways. So I go and respray the paper towel and wipe down the machine and go throw out the paper towel. When I come back I hear her talking to the client and say the words ""yeah don't ever do that it's kinda creepy"" assuming she was referring to what I just did I just said ""sorry I really didn't think it was a big deal I was just trying to wipe it down quick"" PT just shoots me a dirty look again and says nothing. Anyways I just continued on my workout but felt like absolute shit. Asked my friend who's also a PT if maybe I broke some unrwritten rule and he told me no she was just being a C**t and to email the manager and complain but the thing is I work next door and go there almost everyday and have either a neutral or good relationship everyone else who works there and don't want to ruin that.

She's a nursing major but has yet to get into a nursing program. She has put so much effort into her major but hasn't been accepted yet.

&#x200B;

She has had a string of bad jobs (bad service industry jobs, inconsistent schedules). She has been out of work for months now. Over the last few weeks, I have been pushing her to look for and apply for jobs. I've tried to convince her to apply for as many as she can, even ones she does not want, because it is good to have a backup plan. She says she is looking for a job that will ""set her up for the future,"" and is neglecting any service industry or ""low skill"" jobs (not to say service jobs do not require skill...I work one). I know she is capable of better jobs, but still think she needs some sort of income. She started to get frustrated with me for nagging her about it. Admittedly, I have been, but I feel it is for her own good. She has started to look, but yet to apply to any.

&#x200B;

AITA for nagging her so much? She's made me out to be the villain but all I'm trying to do is help her. I don't know if I am in the wrong for pushing too hard or if she is being stubborn.

c4hqu0	2019-06-24 03:39:27	Theabsoluteaverage	Aita for roasting my slightly autistic brother	"Mobile so sorry

My twin brother is slightly autistic but barely like just enough to be on the scale but even so he’s always been incredibly intelligent and is in advanced courses and a year ahead in math

 but he still has habits that I’ve been trying to break him out of like for example he chews on things and for the longest time I’ve tried to get him to stop I got him gum but he chews way to loud and then when he’s done instead of throwing it out he just sticks it to a counter or wall around the house so we don’t get him gum anymore  

But he still continues to chew on shit. Our mom is very stressed out and brought these things that you boil then push a button then it turns hard and hot which go on your shoulders well guess what he chews that too and that has chemicals in it and he’s broken like 3 of em so mom doesn’t get those anymore

And the real thing is that today he was chewing on a nerf sword  that’s so old our dog used it as a chew toy 

And I got very angry because I’ve  told him multiple times to stop chewing on shit and look he’s autistic however he can speak perfectly normal and in fact barely anyone knows he has autism because he is so normal and he is in high school I just can’t see why he’s still doing shit like this

And so I told him that “he’s acting like a 2 year old or a dog” and some other hurtful things but I’ve told him this so many times I don’t know what to do my dad says I’m an asshole for doing it and he’s mad at me so Aita and if so what should I do instead


Edit: so I apologized and there is no hard feelings but we did talk and he said he will make an effort to chew on things a bit less and ill make an effort to understand more and not be an asshole

c4hqbb	2019-06-24 03:38:02	Cakesandpies101	AITA for applying for a president position as a high school junior?	"Sorry in advance if this situation seems petty compared to others that are posted on this sub.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, a guy (who I'll call Chad), a girl (who isn't relevant to the story), and I ran for president of our high school orchestra board. I won based on a combination of student votes and the teacher's choice, and the other two candidates were made vice presidents. The glaring issue with this was that I'm an incoming junior, whereas Chad and the other girl are seniors.

&#x200B;

I was obviously pretty stoked when I found out I won, but one of my friends who is close to Chad told me he was really salty about losing. I brushed that aside until I saw Chad talking to the teacher privately soon after. He looked miserable. The next day the teacher pulls me into his office and proposes that Chad and I become co-presidents, so I knew Chad was bitching about me to him. I didn't want to start any beef (nor did I care too much about giving Chad a promotion), so I told him I was okay with the idea.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today, a different mutual friend of Chad and I told me that Chad was bad-mouthing me behind my back, saying things like ""u/ Cakesandpies101 is a great player but a shitty leader"" and ""I don't know why he even ran for president"", *before* the election results had came out. That came as a shock to me because I always thought Chad was arrogant and somewhat entitled (he does super well in school and on the swim team), but I didn't expect him to be so hostile toward me because we don't know each other too well.

&#x200B;

The more I think about it though, the more I suspect I'm in the wrong here, and I feel conflicted and anxious about the whole situation.  I honestly mostly applied for president for fun and didn't expect to actually win. (The teacher never gave an option to run for vice president. If he did, I probably would've opted for that.) I feel that I acted selfishly by going for president, when I knew I'll have another year to try again, while Chad and the other candidate don't.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I ran for president of my high school orchestra (mostly in jest) and win, despite only being a junior. One of the seniors who lost bad-mouthed me behind my back and complained to the teacher, causing us to become co-presidents.

c4hp5r	2019-06-24 03:34:41	hollowskull499	AITA for blocking a creepy “friend” out of the blue on discord.	"So, long story short I met this person on a random discord server I joined. We joined it at the same time and they decide to friend request me. We talk on dm and get to know each other. We just talk about our interests and just basic conversation. We talked every evening usually it involved sending funny videos, or music, and the occasional dirty joke. 

     Our conversations always seemed natural and friendly, sometimes deep life stuff. We eventually voice chat and they ask me explicit questions like whether or not I masturbate or if I like to dominate sexually. I stupidly answered because I have a bad habit of giving people the benefit of the doubt plus, this person said they have a drinking problem so, I don’t expect normal things to come out of their mouth. 

     The next weekend rolls around I send them a selfie, nothing exciting just my face and they tell me that I’m very cute and attractive. I blush and move on. I send another selfie and this time they say, “Damn boy, look at you. I’d love to wrestle you”. I ask what they mean and they respond with, “I mean have hot sex”. I get very weirded out and respond with, “Dude, you’re 26 and I’m 17. That’s fucking weird” They say, “Oh, you’re playing the age card. I’ll leave then”. They continue expressing their urges for me and I just laugh it off in disbelief assuming that they’re drunk. They get angry and say, “Fuck off if I’m a joke to you. I’m serious”. They continue being kinky and pushy, telling me to give them a chance. I say no because I’m a straight guy. They then continue talking kinky with me saying they’ll transition into a girl and get a sex change so they can be my girlfriend. 

      The next morning after assessing that whole interaction in my head, a lot of red flags popped up. The manipulative language, the pushiness, ect.  I just got bad vibes off them all of a sudden and didn’t feel safe talking to them anymore in case things would go further. So, I just reported them and blocked them without saying a word. Though I feel guilty because they seem like a nice person, they told me I’m a great person and want me to be happy. I just couldn’t shake the vibes after that. Plus them saying they wanted me to pound them and wouldn’t mind doing the same and admitting out of the blue they’re sexually attracted to me. We’ve only known each other for 3 weeks.

c4hobg	2019-06-24 03:32:13		WIBTA for not showing up to a wedding invitation?	"**My family has received an invitation to Family A's child's wedding at the end of the month, but we are contemplating on whether we should attend.**

&#x200B;

**Backstory:**

A few months ago my father's mother passed away and friends/ family that lived 75+ miles away came over to give their condolences. If someone could not drive down, they would at least make the effort to phone my dad instead. However, a certain family who lives less than 6 miles from me did not bother to phone or come over to give their condolences. 

We've helped this family immigrate to the US by allowing them to live with us for a couple of years rent free and provided food. Once they moved out, they literally ignored us, unless they were hosting a party every 5-10 years. The only reason we'd even get an invite is that my mom and Family A's father are siblings.

I'm not saying that my dad is entitled to receiving condolences. But knowing the relationship between our families and the things we've done for them, you would think that they would at least show a little sympathy.

c4hn0r	2019-06-24 03:28:24	hiddenandsad	WIBTA if I comment on a post my SO made on Facebook in which he deliberately left me out of the pictures?	"Sorry if the title is confusing. Throwaway for all the usual reasons. Apologies for formatting, I am on mobile. I think I'll probably be TA but I leave the final judgment up to you, my family of Reddit strangers.

A little background: my SO and I will have been together 2 years come August. We do live together. He has two kids from his previous marriage, a son (11) and a daughter (turning 8); their mom is not in the picture anymore as of this year so they both live with us. He is 38 and I am 22, if that makes any difference.

Last Saturday was the oldest child's birthday. He was going to go to a sleepover with friends in the evening so his father and I wanted to take him out for lunch. I offered to drive since my SO had been to the dentist in the morning and was still a little loopy. We all had a good time—there was lots of laughter and many silly and serious pictures. 

On Sunday, I noticed that my SO had made a post about the lunch on Facebook. When I opened the post up I quickly realized that I was not in a single picture. Every photo he posted had only combinations of him, his son, and his daughter. There was zero mention of me. It was like I never even went to the lunch. 

Frankly, I was hurt. I have talked to him about 'hiding' me before when he mentioned that his mom still doesn't even know I exist. She definitely knew about his ex girlfriend—his mom sent him a Christmas package when I was already in the picture and it included a gift for the ex. His mom didn't even know they'd already been separated for a while by that point. I understand not wanting to broadcast our relationship as not everyone is comfortable with the age gap, but it seems to be skirting the edges of overkill, to me. I did ask him straight up a while ago if he is trying to hide me, and his answer was a resounding 'no.'

So here is the WIBTA part. I am considering leaving a comment on his post. Something like 'Looks like you guys had fun!' or 'Looks like you three had fun!' Innocuous enough to the innocent FB bystander, but definitely calling him out since he knows I was also there. I am honestly a bit insulted by the fact that he deliberately went through and chose pictures that didn't have me in them for his post. I've been with him through thick and thin, including a recent tragedy after which any (probably sane) 22-year-old would have packed up and left. I didn't because I love him and I love his kids. I consider them to be my family. So why is he trying to give the impression online that I'm not in his life? Am I just being immature and entitled, overreacting? WIBT passive aggressive A if I comment on his post? 


Tl;dr— bf deliberately left me out of one of his FB posts so I am considering leaving a comment on the post.


Edit: To anyone who's interested, though I doubt there are many. I did talk to him. He got mad at me for being hurt about the pictures. He derided me and said that I don't matter and basically ended the issue with 'oh am I supposed to include your selfies? Yeah, we have SOOO many good pictures with you to include.' There was a lot more that he said but I won't go into that. So. I guess we're done. Thanks, everyone, for the advice. Good night Reddit."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c4hlgl	2019-06-24 03:24:03	djl8699	AITA for being annoyed that I had to wait on my brother, again	"First things first, I drive but my brother doesn’t. Yesterday was a nice day out so he text me in the morning to see if I wanted to meet him to play some basketball. Sure, I wanted to play, but this time he wanted to play at a court by his house, which is about 25-30 minutes away from where I live. I agree that’s what we’ll do and tell him I’ll meet him in about an hour or so.  When I leave I text him that I was leaving, and then on the way there I even called him to let him know I was in traffic but would be there in 10 minutes.

At this point he knew I was coming and even had an idea of when I would arrive. To me, basic consideration would dictate that he would be ready or at least close to it by the time I get there.  When I get there I park outside his building, get out and text him that I was there. He’ll be right down, he says.  

10 minutes later he’s still not down, ok no biggie. 10 minutes after that he’s still not down, and I’m a little annoyed. He’s looking for something, he texts me.  5 minutes after that he finally shows up.  Normally I wouldn’t say anything but having to wait on him has become a habit with him, and for whatever reason I thought it prudent to make a point.

“I’ve been waiting for 25 minutes.” I said, to which he replies in a sarcastic manner “Uhhhh, I was looking for something?”  The something in question turned out to be a headband. At this point it’s clear to me he just doesn’t respect my time and takes it for granted.  And quite frankly I’ve become tired of his long history of selfishness and inconsideration. 

So I told him that it’s rude to make somebody wait on them for something so insignificant.  But I’m talking to somebody that’s never wrong, and this is when he goes into his whole indignation routine and tells me to fuck off with that bullshit, as a matter of fact he doesn’t have to deal with it and to fucking leave. So of course I’m pretty pissed at this point so I get in my car and leave.

5 minutes later he calls me and tells me that if I want to meet him I still can but then starts scolding me telling me not to treat him like that and to stop being petty and whatnot. At this point I’m incensed that he has the nerve to berate me and the conversation quickly turns into a full-blown shouting match.

Realizing this is going to go nowhere with tempers so hot I tell him that I can’t talk to him now, but he’s not having it and he continues to berate me, so I hang up. This is when he starts continually calling me to yell at me, so I block him.

I ended up unblocking him later, and that’s when I get voicemails and text after text of him attacking my character, telling me how wrong I am, how petty I am, he even went so far as to suggest I need psychiatric help.

c4hlfv	2019-06-24 03:24:00	Mrs_Fortune626	AITA for telling dad to contribute?	"I live with my husband, 9 yo daughter, and my father.  The house and all the bills are paid by my husband and I who work full time jobs.  My father is employed part time, Friday and Saturday nights with a few hours tossed in, he's retired and making some spending money outside of his fixed income.  My father does not contribute financially. We cook dinner about 5 days out of the week and eat with him. He pays his phone, insurance, gas, some snacks and drinks which are not communal but instead go straight into a mini fridge which he keeps downstairs (he lives in our basement).  He uses the money he makes to go to Vegas at least 3 or 4 times a year and other things that are exclusively for him.

So about 6 years ago my step mom left my dad and we invited him to live with us on the condition that he help out with babysitting so we could work.  This worked for about 2 years and then it started to become harder to get him to watch the kid when we needed it.  My husband and I don't go out a lot but we like to run our weekly errands together without the kid.

With this part time job and his vacations we are constantly having to make arrangements around him.  So instead of having someone to help out and make our scheduling easier, we are now having to find a sitter or take off work early to accommodate him. I enjoy having a relationship with my father again, because I haven't had one for most of my life, and I've let a lot of this go without really speaking up about how I feel because of it.  I dont expect him to be a live in nanny or anything but he's supposed to be making our lives easier by being here.

This all came to a head when I found out that he had been talking badly about me and my husband behind our backs in front of my daughter.  She mentioned something he had said about our housekeeping (which isn't terrible but we could definitely dust and vacuum more.)  What really got me is that he wants to complain about it but this man can't even wash a dish and we are having to pick up after him constantly.  

Eventually this turned into a huge fight with him and he said he would move out and I told him to find some place where he would be able to go in vacations every other month on his income.  I'm a piece of shit because I brought how he was a drug addict while I was a kid.  I told him that if he wants to stay he either needs to he more available to help us or start paying.  He says that I'm unreasonable and acts like I want to chain him to the house for infinite babysitting and that he helps us out more than enough. 

AITA?  Not 100% that I'm not but my father has always had a knack for making me doubt myself since I was a little kid.

TLDR; Dad lives with me completely free in return for babysitting.  He doesn't want to be available much of the time for it, but insists that I'm an asshole for expecting more out of him.  Told him to either be more available, or start paying us rent"	Not the A-hole	0	0	108.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

c4hk9q	2019-06-24 03:20:36		AITA for “snitching” on my younger cousins?	"EDIT: when i say “cool cousin” that’s not me calling myself cool. i don’t think any of this shit is cool. the children think that i’m cool

i come from a big family, my grandma had 9 kids and now she has 20 grandkids, if i’m remembering right (not close to all of my family.) we live around all different parts of the state, but this weekend we came together for a birthday party.

im the oldest grandchild of the bunch, and frankly it’s put me in a weird spot with my younger cousins. i was 8-14 years old when a lot of them were born, so growing up i was the “cool” cousin. well times passed, im 20 now. the five cousins involved in this story are 10-13, so they’re at an age where they’re starting to ask... questions that their parents should probably answer. i’ve always been very close to them, but now they feel so close to me that they feel they can confide things in me. one of them told me today she’s already tried a juul.  another told me how he really wants to have sex, but he’s only 10. they confide things in me that i don’t know if they’re just normal things kids go through and if i should tell their parents or not.

but what they confided in me today, that just was too much for me. 

i would like to clarify, though: i was NOT in the house where this event took place, i was nowhere near any of this mess. i just heard about it from one of the youngins. all of the adults were already asleep, i was told this went down at around midnight. 

the 5 kids were all sleeping in the living room together because they’re all very close. just hanging out, watching tv, joking with each other, whatever. two of the boys, 10 and 12, started watching.. adult videos. mind you, two of the cousins in the living room were girls. i don’t wanna get graphic because i’m talking about children, but we all know what adult videos are for. they did not leave the room to watch the videos. to make it worse, there was a “puppet show” involving flashlights and dangling .. things. i really don’t want to get graphic with this because it involves children, typing this makes me feel icky tbh. 

so i told my aunts about what happened, and it’s being dealt with. i just don’t want them to feel like they can’t share things with me. the line between the “cool” cousin they know me as, and the adult cousin that i actually am now, is a very fine line. i already have them asking me to try my juul, asking me about my sex life, asking me about god and if he’s actually real, asking me about what a girls moan sounds like. but those are stories for another post. am i the asshole?"

c4hjab	2019-06-24 03:17:46		WIBTA For Moving Out?	"Hi everyone!
Ok so for context, I am 18F, my siblings are M21 and F22. I live with them and both my parents. We’re poor, and we’ve always shared all our money with each other and we’re really close. 

That being said, I am also disabled, and I’m about to receive a lump sum of money for disability benefits along with monthly payments because there are a lot of jobs I can’t do. 

As I’m getting my GED, I was planning to go to a community college that my siblings are, which I really didn’t wanna do, however, I found a university only a few hours from home and in the same state, that accepts the GED. 

I figured I can use this large amount of money to apply and move out if I get accepted. However, my parents want to spend it on a trip, a car for me, a car for my sister (that’s more important) and mainly “fun” stuff. 

I figured it’s because we always had the mentality that any money that comes in is for the family. But because of this, I’m afraid to tell them that I wanna move out, but if I don’t, I’m gonna be stuck at home for much longer. I just don’t want to but I also don’t wanna leave them in the dust. 

They are not abusive in the least, but they’ve made it clear to me that it’s money for the family but the university I found is really nice and safe and I would really like to go. I’m actually visiting the city with my boyfriend right now and I love it. I’m just afraid because I don’t know the right thing to do.

c4hizw	2019-06-24 03:16:56	bluedemon5252	AITA for telling my family I was hungry af?	"So first of all, I work at a breakfast restaurant. I've worked every day for about 9 days straight, and everyday I work, I eat breakfast food. 

We had a family game night (there was my sister, brother, step-sister, my sister's bf, my mom, and my step-dad there). I went to go pick up my brother about 20 minutes away, and I was famished so I picked up 6 chicken Mcnuggets on my way back. I have a large appetite, that was nothing. I was still hungry when I got to my Mom's house.

When I got home, I asked my mom what she was making for dinner, because my step-sister had told me she was thinking about making breakfast for dinner. Dinner was almost exactly what I had for lunch at my work, so I told her I didnt want to eat it again for dinner. She told me she'd make me some bratwurst.

Everyone younger than 30 went to go play a game while my mom and step-dad cooked. 
I'd already told everyone there I wasnt going to eat the breakfast food because I eat it way too much already, it didnt seem like a big deal before dinner.

My mom announced dinner was ready. She didnt make the bratwurst, which was fine with me. I figured I would just grab something to eat after game night. We all sit down, and my mom asks me, ""Kaelin, aren't you going to eat?"" 
And I said, ""No thank you, I'm good."" 
Then my step-dad says, ""it's because of the McDonalds you bought, you're already full!""
I said, ""that was just a snack, I'm still hungry af, dont you know what my appetite is like? I work at a breakfast restaurant so I eat breakfast too much, this is what I had for lunch."" 

Then my mom says, ""that was really rude Kaelin""
I didnt understand. I said, ""What was rude?"" 
I thought the rude part was when I mentioned how big my appetite was.
My sister said, ""when you said you were hungry af""
And my first thought was that it was because I cussed, but my mom hasn't gotten mad about cussing for years. But it didnt make sense to me that it was rude that I said I was hungry. I'd told her ahead of time i wasnt going to eat it, but that i still wanted food. I didnt complain about not getting what I thought she was making for me. My step-dad implied that I wasnt hungry because of McDonalds, but that wasnt true. 

I disliked being told I was rude when I feel I didnt do anything wrong. Then again, maybe I should've just kept quiet and acted like I was full off McDonalds.

c4himx	2019-06-24 03:15:56	blmounce	WIBTA for keeping the money?	"Another long time lurker instead of posted here but I really wanted to get some opinions on this. I run my own small, personal business in which I watch pets and farms. Sometimes I watch animals in my home but most often I travel out and do in-home sitting for others. I feel as though I charge VERY reasonable prices. Sometimes I only make $20 on a weekend if I subtract all the gas/food/etc expenses for that weekend. 

This past weekend I was hired for a job that I have had for years (watching 20 or so sheep and 55+ ducks) although I was also watching their three dogs which I have never been hired to do before. This was supposed to be a “trial run” since they are going to Barcelona for 10 days in July. 

Last night (Saturday) one of the dogs got loose and ran off and went missing for 3 hours before finally making her way back. This has NEVER happened to me or the owners before. Obviously as soon as the dog got out I called the owners and they immediately packed up and came home (1.5 hrs) to help me look for her. 

I was paid $165 for 3 days of animal watching, fri-sun and after running this situation over with my mom she says I should return all of their money. And while I intend to write them a letter of apology (despite the fact I’ve told them one million times already) I feel though that I should keep the $55 and a little extra for the time I did keep them (fri afternoon-late Saturday night). I feel like I deserve it and shouldn’t have to completely lose money over a situation that resolved itself. 

Some important mentions: 
•The dog is an extremely skittish/submissive border collie named Joy.
•The farm I stay at has an electric gate for cars to go into and out of with an automatic closing time of 2 minutes. Last night when I opened the front door she bolted and wouldn’t come when I called her. After circling a few laps around the front yard she ran out of the actively closing electrical gate. 
•The dog is used for herding trials and likely makes its owners a lot of money but that is not confirmed. 
•The owners live 45 minutes away from me (gas here is expensive) and I only charged them $165 for what to me feels more like a $200+ per weekend job 

Long story short, WIBTA for keeping all the money? Or TA for keeping just some of it? Do they deserve it all for my foolish mistake (even though I wasn’t forewarned it was a problem)?

EDIT: I want to keep $82 which is for one full night and 1/2 of a day. I’m not interested in keeping it all. But I’m not opposed to giving it all back either. I want to do what is right but I want it to be fair to myself too."	Asshole	0	0	57.0	16.0	0.0	0.0

I took care of my mother for 14 years of my life(I’m now 30) she was a drug addict and mentally unstable. I suffer from mental illness and self diagnosed in the spectrum. I feel no great emotions for my extended family and see no reason to phone or contact them, they rarely contacted me or my mom either. 

Almost three months ago my mom passed suddenly. No one but my sister really stayed in contact with me or comforted me. There is some confusion where I will live now( my mom and me rented the top half of a house from her ex, my dad, and he had the bottom, I can not afford rent as I’m on income support) though my sister has offered me the room in her house. 

My aunt phones recently to ask me how I’m doing. This is the first phone call since my mom passed. I tell her ok I cleaned up the house and got rid of moms things. She tells me it’s wrong and I’ll regret that. I say nothing. She asks me if dad is kicking me out. I say no? When she mentions my sister and if I’m moving in with her I tell her maybe, she says “well you are getting rid of your animals right? Your sister won’t let you bring all of them” needless to say this conversation ended shortly.


(I have a dog and 3 rescue cats, my sister never mentioned anything about them) 

Apparently today was my aunts birthday though and my sister asked me if I phoned her? I told her no I felt no need to, I don’t like making phone calls and she made it awkward.  My sister asked me if I’d be ok never talking to any of the extended family ever and I told her truthfully yes. I have no feelings any which way.

We all play dnd together and have a group chat so we can notify each other if we're going to be late or the time was changed. Naturally, we all make fun of each other and a lot of memes are shared. 

Anyway, after a brief argument about beheadings  and how the body could be alive for a short period after (don't ask me about that, that's a whole other story) when he said that I was wrong and therefor needed to be punished. I fired back with the obviously childish comeback (on purpose) that his face needed to be punished.

He then asked his girlfriend (also in the group) if she would sit on his face. Sexual, yes, but not out of place. She replied, saying no, she wouldn't do that and I said that even his own girlfriend denied him. A strong burn I thought, but nothing he couldn't handle since we had been trading blows pretty much all month (plenty of fat jokes on me, forever alone jokes on another member and young jokes on the youngest member. No one has been spared).

Apparently not. Even though the topic chanted to bug and nuggets in the chat (I don't know and after that, I stopped paying attention), he was pretty upset, according to his girlfriend. She messaged me and told me he was pretty upset and had to be calmed down. I messaged him to apologize, but honestly, I'm not that sorry. 

At least, I don't think I'm the asshole here, since the group mentality is talk shit, get hit and I've been shit on plenty of times by him. Hell, he used to make fun of me before I even started playing dnd with him.

The last time she came out to play board games with us she started at her phone the whole time not engaging in conversation with us. 

\*\*Background info:\*\*

We all went to the same middle and high school but I've been close with Ashley since high school and Ashley and Karen have been best friends since high school. I only gotten to know Karen better after the 3 of us lived in a new city (very far from home) for our jobs. Ashley and Karen eventually became roommates for a year with no issues. 

We hung out altogether every once in a while but always kept in touch. Ashley and Karen are really nice people. Then one day I invited Ashley and Karen to my wedding and Karen was interested in one of my male friends (I'll call him Billy) from a different friend group I hang out with. I introduced Karen to Billy and they became friends immediately. 

Karen hung out with my other friend group where Billy was and long story short.... they didn't work out. Billy wanted to only be friends and Karen said she couldn't help but still liked him so they ended hanging out. But during that time (a year), Karen made the \*\*strong\*\* effort to befriend ALL of his friends and get super close while abandoning to hang out with me and Ashley. Karen invited Billy and his friends to her home to hangout while excluding me and Ashley. When I found out about that, I was super hurt. I introduced her to my friends to begin with. 

One of the female friends from Billy group (Josie) created a group text with several girls including Karen and I, and I just get so annoyed that Karen responds to her texts enthusiastically while ignoring texts from me and Ashley. 

What pissed me off most was one time I had lunch with Josie one time and she mentioned she should've invited Karen. I told her it's fine since it was nice we could hang out once. Then she said she just feels bad not including Karen to hangouts because she's in a new city and doesn't seem to know anyone. I was thinking wtf she was roommates with Ashley her best friend..... and Josie was like who's Ashley? Karen never mentioned Ashley ever. 

How do I handle this like an adult? Do I tell Karen how hurt I am by all of this or? 

tl;dr: One of my old friends ""Karen"" doesn't text or hang out with me and her old best friend Ashley. But she enthusiastically hangs out with the friends I introduced her too."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I bought a used PC last summer, and it kind of sucked. So I started using one of bf’s two backup laptops (backup for his work — he works on a desktop from home) for my schoolwork and other stuff. 

He told me he planned to sell it. But when some pixels on the screen got a little weird (not sure if I poked/damaged it or if it was a natural issue), he said he wouldn’t really be able to sell it and that it was ok for me to keep using it.

Fast forward to tonight, and I changed the wallpaper on the laptop. Because it was tied to his main PC’s account, it changed his wallpaper too. He said he wanted to change it back, and he was nice about it. But then I said, “If they’re tied together, I hope you can’t access anything on the laptop.”

He got upset. He said he couldn’t care less about whatever I had on there but that he felt like I’d never really asked to use the laptop, maybe was the cause of the damage, and now I was acting like I owned it.

I kinda get what he’s saying. But I don’t think I caused the damage, even though I was the only one using it (I think it was just a fluke). And since he wasn’t going to sell it then, it was pretty much mine to use indefinitely.

I just graduated high school and yesterday was my graduation party. I don’t have many friends from my high school; I only invited 7 people. My mom knows that I didn’t have a huge group of friends, and we were both fine with that and excited to just have a few guests from school along with the rest of our family. 

The party was a standard open house 2-6pm. All but one of my friends (who was out of town this weekend, already talked about it before) RSVP. They all said they’d be coming around 4-4:30 and staying probably to the end. 

Finally the party rolls around and I enjoy the first  two hours. It then becomes 4 and am now expecting my friends to show up. I restock some drinks, make sure the food isn’t empty, clear a table, and put some more ice cream in the freezer.

4:30 and no one is here still. 

5:00 and nothing. At this point my family start asking if I planned on having any friends come, which was pretty embarrassing.

5:30 people start to leave and so I start packing up disappointingly.

At 5:45, finally, just 3 out of the 6 friends who said they were coming show up all together. Apparently they all drove together from another kids graduation party just wanted to stop to say hi before heading back. I guess it was a good party. They ate ice cream, I acted nice and thanked them for coming, and then they were gone. 

My best friend out of all of them was the one who was sadly out of town. I was texting him most of the time and he was shocked that this happened. I think he may have confronted the other 3 friends asking why they didn’t come. 

1 of those friends texted me saying he forgot my grad party was that day and he was sorry. 

A second texted me saying he was at work the entire time. He works at a nail salon that closes at 2. 

And the third no show never texted or talked to me about any of it. 

So I’m pretty upset and really leaning towards cutting basically all of these people off and I guess hopefully finding some better ones in college. One of the people who showed up late, though I’m still close to and she didn’t want to leave as early as the others, said I’d be a dick if I don’t text them back and accept their apology."

"Jen was one of those friends who would go no contact with no explanation, then surface months/years later. I was supposed to drop everything when she had crises but she wasn't there for mine. She once texted me at 5am to tell me she was in crisis. I looked up her parents by 5:15 and told them. They intervened and got her help. Things were positive, but she faded when I needed an ear. When she resurfaced, she disclosed that she had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which she asked me to read up on. Done. She said her BPD was not an excuse for her choices and she owned them. She said her depression was under control and she was in treatment. 

We talked for months and on the Jen scale, that was a pretty good run. I saw her twice when I passed through her city. We discussed meeting up at a tourist location (platonic, no shared quarters) and hanging out. She made her travel arrangements, I did likewise.

Day 1 went well enough. Good visit, it was fun.

Day 2, I get a text. Jen is stressed out and ""can't even"" consider going outside or interacting, doesn't want to discuss it. Alrighty. I was disappointed, but I was also mad at myself for not seeing it coming. That was on me. I had enough of a baseline to know this was not my best idea. Investing time and effort in a one-way, erratic friendship was my choice, and I needed to make better ones. I did my own thing that day, and decided Jen-related plans were not an ideal policy going forward. I was done prioritizing someone who can't be arsed to cross streets to see me when I crossed state lines to hang. I get another text from Jen that evening asking if I have plans the following day. I told her where and when I planned to have breakfast. ""Is that an invitation?"" The non Jen-related plan policy being in effect, I responded, ""It's where I'll be."" ""See you there!"" Right. Still, I did some reading on the ideal way to end a friendship with someone living with BPD. The reading basically said to end it quickly.

Day 3, I go to planned breakfast at the planned time and pay the check & tip as soon as the plate drops. I consumed a Jen-free breakfast while reading the news on my phone. Just as I got done blocking her as a contact on phone and social media and was getting up to leave, Jen wanders in. She plops down across from me with a ""how are you?"" I calmly told her I'd been better, and I that was disappointed about not having met up yesterday. Her expression twisted into anger. ""Nice job making me feel bad about that."" ""I'm not here to fight, I can't control how you feel, I can just control what I do. I'm going to get on with my day now. We're done here."" Left her at the table, had a lovely time exploring the tourist destination solo, caught my flight home the following morning, and never saw her again.

My dad has been wanting me to ""publish"" a book for a long time now. I come from a family that's not rich per se but we live comfortably enough to afford a few things. My parents are parents, they're utterly obsessed with my writing and think it's godsend. I have a few national awards under my belt so I'm not a joke or anything but suffice it to say self publishing is pretty much a joke-- anyone can self publish anything if you have the $ to do it, I'm pretty sure amateur furry fanfics have been hardbound on Amazon, but my parents think a self-published book will make a good feature for my resume or something. At my age it would be very difficult for me to get published by a major publishing house, even if  am indeed a good author for my age-- I still have a lot of growing and refining to do to get to a professional level of authorship.

For a yearish my dad has been pressuring me to ""write a novel"" and I REALLY don't want to. Partially I've fallen out of the habit of writing since I've been busy with school and other activities, but also I don't want to self publish something I'll be embarrassed by later. For context when I was 13 my parents self published stuff I had written when I was 10-11... complete with embarrassing illustrations, and now people ask about it all the time. I hate it. I don't want something like that to happen again with this book, 8 years from now, when I am trying to get my foot in the door at a major publishing house or at a normal job or whatever.

So my dad has been pressuring me to write this, and I know if I didn't write it there would be consequences, so I just compiled a bunch of short stories I wrote for school and stuff and gave him that, around 60ish pages of work, just to shut him up for a while.

It's only now that he's starting to read through it and I realized I put some stuff in there that I would not want to be put out there-- content that is triggering for me, that's inspired by eating disorders I had that I kept hidden from my parents, etc. And that I don't want to tell my parents about anyway. So my dad is asking me about this story and I say, sorry I don't want that one to be in the book, I'm deleting it. Then he says no, it's good, keep it in... goes on like this back and forth for like 5 min. I get pretty adamant and admittedly lose my temper pretty majorly because this is pretty sensitive content to me (my dad doesn't know why though) and call him a psychopath. Then he calls me a rotten misbehaving spoilt brat and an asshole, tells me I am a child and to ""get in line and know your place"", that I better ""shape the fuck up for college"", and says just because I wrote 10 pages doesn't mean I get to choose what happen to them, and that I gave him this manuscript a year ago and said it was ""finished"" so why am I throwing a fit now, etc. He has some good points, and I know I shouldn't have lost my temper, but Istill feel that it is ultimately my work and I should be able to choose what happens to it, even if he is my dad.

c4haqy	2019-06-24 02:53:52		AITA for going full on ‘mean girl’ on my dads mistress/my coworker?	"Basically my dad, me, and the other woman all work together. He’s been having a secret affair with her for 4 months (almost as long as she’s been working with us) but in that time she’s also had her own boyfriend, and messed with two other men we work with. She knew he was married with children (oldest is me who is 21, and the youngest is 10) and she reached out to him, and when my mother found their DMs 4 months into the affair she was telling my father to leave our family for hers. My mother posted the screenshots of their messages on FB and she’s friends with most of my coworkers, so everyone knows. And at work any time she’d walk passed me I’d get dirty looks from her and other coworkers would tell me she’d say I’m a little bitch, even though at the time I was saying out of it, and Her and I have never spoken. 

So now at work I make fun of her to my work friends, one of them being one of the guys she messed with. I also found out from the friend she messed with that she said he reason she is ‘divorced’ is because she cheated on her ex husband while he was deployed. But the thing is, legally she is still married bc she refuses to sign the papers. 

I say things like “it’s funny her ex husband is supposed to protect and serve, but she’ll serve anyone even without protection” or “she reminds me of my favorite Disney princess, ‘sleeping around’” or “should I start calling her my new mommy now?” Or “she’s lucky I have a boyfriend because I’d hit up her husband, her kids won’t be the only one calling him daddy”

But my boyfriend says I’m in the wrong (not because of the husband comment, he gets my humor), and he doesn’t want to hear it if I get fired (there was once a physical altercation at work and no one lost their job so I know I’m fine) idk I think if she’s being nasty to me when I did nothing wrong I have the right to be nasty back when she had a hand in destroying my family 

(And before anyone says it: yes I know my father is just as much in the wrong. Me and him aren’t on speaking terms because of this and I’m equally, if not more, mad at him. Also he works in a completely different department so I don’t really see him at work)"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4hagp	2019-06-24 02:53:02	justgorlythings	AITA for not believing my friend even though she swears she’s telling the truth?	"EDIT:

For my info, I’ve posted about this situation in more depth on r/relationships. 

For some background, I have a friend, let’s call her Jen. We have known each other and been close friends for about 3 years. I also have a boyfriend, let’s call him Ryan, who I have been close friends with since high school and dating for about 2 years.

Now to get to the real issue. About a year ago, Jen tried to make joke about my younger brother and his friend. I brushed it off, as it was only a small annoyance, and my friend is prone to making jokes that I find petty at best and mean spirited at worst. 

A couple days after this exchange between Jen and I, a mutual friend of ours was having a birthday party. I was unable to go, but my bf and Jen both went (we have a large group of mutual friends). A few days after the birthday party, my bf came to me and said he was feeling weird because Jen had tried to make a joke about my younger brother and his friend. My bf said it made him uncomfortable because it was clear that Jen was trying to solicit a laugh from him, even after he had shown that he wasn’t comfortable joking about my brother. I texted Jen about the situation, because she was prone to making insensitive jokes and I wanted to address it with her. Jen proceeded to deny that she had ever said anything about my brother, insisting that my boyfriend had lied about the entire situation because he was jealous of our friendship and wanted to isolate me for himself. Eventually I told Jen that it must have been a misunderstanding and forgave her (even though I still believed she was being dishonest). 

Since that incident, Jen has confronted me two separate times, once last summer, and once last week, to tell me that she is hurt that I sided with my bf and trusted him over her. She has twice told me that he lied to ruin our friendship and that it hurts her that I believed him.  Both times that we’ve talked about this, it has eventually resulted in an argument. I cannot shake the feeling that she’s lying to escape accountability and to protect her pride. I keep coming back to the fact that she told me the same joke a week before she allegedly said anything to my bf. 

The last time we spoke about this, last week, it resulted in an argument and I told her not to contact me. I am feeling manipulated, and as if SHE is the one doing what she alleges my bf is doing, which is lying to ruin our relationship. 

I care about my friend and I believe she has many redeeming qualities, but from everything I know about her, she can be a very a prideful, petty person. I’ve never known her to lie but I’ve never known my bf to lie either. When she first told me he lied, I did confront him about it and was very torn on who to trust until I remembered that she had told me the same joke about a week beforehand. 

TL;DR 
Cut off my friend because I believe she’s lying about something she said over a year ago. She insists my boyfriend lied about her to ruin our friendship."	Not enough info	0	0	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

He cant get around without assistance from somebody else. Our friends group always invites him to BBQ/birthdays/other functions. However we have a group of four of us who hangout exclusively almost every weekend. The four of us always kind of do stuff on a whim, where one of us might goto a bar and suggest to go elsewhere instead so we can all meet up. This would be a pain in the ass for my blind friend, as he has to Uber everywhere, and we always kind of just plan stuff out last second.

Also sometimes when we go out the bars are packed which is claustrophobic for him, as he likes to have his own space and room. In addition, when were out somebody has to be in charge of walking him to/from the bathroom, grabbing his beers, etc.

At a BBQ we had last weekend, he told me.how the four of us seem to hangout a lot more often than we do with him. I apologized and hadn't even noticed, as we have other friends in our friends group that we don't text when we do stuff on a whim, its usually just us four. 

Last night we went to a bar that is notoriously overcrowded. It took 10 minutes to walk to the bathroom, people were shoulder to shoulder. Our group of four went, again planned last minute, and we didn't inform our blind friend. He found out and was pissed off. I know that if he has claustrophobic issues, he would've hated it as I was claustrophobic myself with how many people were there. In addition, I had to keep squeezing by people when going out for a smoke/bathroom break, so I know having to walk him would've been a nightmare.

So I had a falling out with a friend about a week ago due to a disagreement. He was acting incredibly childish and I was having none of it. He also caused the issue by acting childish. Since then we haven't spoken. Yesterday I got a text along the lines of, "" I'll always be there for you"" from that friend I then sent him a long winded text explaining that wasn't what I wanted to hear from him. All I wanted was an apology. This friend has been acting like a dick for a very long time and frankly I had enough of it, but I'm the kind of person who can't stand to watch people in pain, even if they're the worst of the worst. I accepted his apology to get it off of his conscience, now I want to know, for myself, AITA for accepting an apology just to get something off of someones conscience?

One of my siblings recently came up to me and said that they were approached by our uncle with a proposal for my sibling to marry my uncle's child, aka my our first cousin. My sibling is entertaining the idea and leaning towards a yes. I feel like this is clearly wrong and disgusting because that's basically incest. We live in the US, we are an extremely educated family, we've always found the idea of first cousin marriage weird and wrong, but somehow all my family members are on board with this except me. Am I taking crazy pills???

I told my sibling that if this marriage happens, I will not be a part of their wedding and no longer be involved in their lives. This is a hard line for me. We grew up together! I feel like this uncle has been grooming my sibling from when we were kids until the time we were adults for them to marry my uncle's child. I also think my dad is being selfish thinking that this marriage will pave the way for his future because then he won't have to go to a retirement home and the cousin will take care of him in his old age. There's a lot more to this story and I don't want to give specific details but I'll be happy to clarify if needed.

At the time, I hadn't considered tipping since I didn't have the money for it anyways, until the next day when I was talking with my mother about it and the fact that I didn't tip came up and she got really upset at me. She said that people shouldn't go out to eat if they couldn't tip which got me pretty annoyed and I ended the discussion pretty quickly after that.

c4h06s	2019-06-24 02:24:30		AITA FOR TELLING A HOMELESS MAN TO FUCK OFF DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH.	So I’m using my throwaway account just in case. Well let’s get this started a few weeks ago I got pissed after some drama that happened in my job while I was walking back to my house this homeless man who I knew for a years before came to me smiling asking for money, I was pissed off at the time because of what happened in my job I told him to fuck off to his children and ask them for money ( his children have abandoned him for whatever reason). He just looked at me for a few seconds and his smile turned into sadness just like that. Once I got back home and realized what I’ve done I just immediately regretted it so I’ve decided the next day to go to him and apologize. But once I went out looking for him (he lives in a tent where most of the homeless people in my area gather up) I couldn’t find him. I spent a day or two wondering what happened to him, I went to some of the homeless people who lived in tents near him and asked them where the hell he was they told me he collapsed a few days ago and has gone into a coma since then. I decided to visit him which was like a 10 minute ride he was semi-conscious so I talked to him about how I felt guilty for what I said but I don’t think he listened or was realizing what I was saying to him. Fast forward to last Thursday he was pronounced dead. None of his children cared showing up I paid for his funeral service and his burial a couple of his homeless friends and people who usually stopped by and gave him money showed up his children never bothered showing up though which isn’t really surprising I doubt they know or even care he’s dead. But the guilt is still stuck with me even though I paid for his funeral and all I still feel like shit.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Last week I was on my way to work when I started to realize the multivitamin I had taken just prior to leaving got stuck in my throat. I stopped by the local McDonald's to get a drink to wash it down. I was in a rush (to get to work on time) and I noticed the drive-thru was pretty full, so I parked in one of the first spaces when entering the lot (pretty far from the drive through line). I got my drink pretty quickly (there was no one in line inside) and finished swallowing the pill.

When I got back to my car, I saw the drive-thru line had backed up and the last guy was blocking my car in. I acknowledged him as I got in my car and I assumed that meant he would back up for me a little so I could exit my parking space (as I think any normal person would do). I put my car in reverse and saw he hadn't moved for me at all. I waited 20-30 seconds and the drive-thru line, including his car, had not moved at all. I gave a quick tap on my horn (very polite honk IMO) to ask him to move and through the rear-view I saw him glance at my car, and back to his phone. I gave another two quick taps and he refused to acknowledge me. A bit longer passes, I see I'm going to be late to work at this point, so I just begin laying on my horn without stopping. This goes on for about 45 seconds and everyone is looking at me. Eventually the lady in front of the guy blocking me in gets out of her car and goes up to my passenger window looking very upset. I'm still laying on my horn at this point. I see her knock on his window and then I hear (through the horn mind you) her yelling at him in Armenian. He is also apparently Armenian.

c4gxgy	2019-06-24 02:16:59	TheMediterraneanTaco	AITA for depriving my daughter of stickers	"First some background. I’m a happily married man with a 2.5yr old daughter living a fairly normal suburban life. However, I have a bizarre and unusual phobia, pittakionophobia. It’s a fear of stickers. Remember that time you saw a bandaid floating around the public pool and thought ewwww? Slap a pool bandaid on a couple hundred apples at the grocery store and that’s how my brain processes those little stickers on fruit. It’s totally disgusting, makes my skin crawl, but in a pinch I can cut off the section of the apple with a sticker on it.

I’ve built a reality around my phobia. My wife peels off stickers from things she buys. If I shop it’s generally at either Costco or the farmers’ market where fewer things have stickers. My issue was pretty manageable until I had a daughter.

I knew this would happen. Kids love stickers, everyone knows that, but what happens if they don’t exist growing up? Is it nature or nurture? I survived 2.5 years with a sticker-free child except for the occasional bandaid.

Here’s what happens. She got smart and learned you need an injury to get a bandaid and bandaids are the only form of sticker she can get. She started faking injuries and claiming booboos to get the thing she wants.

My wife thinks I should seek cognitive behavioral therapy and let her be a kid. I’m of the opinion that kids had perfectly fine childhoods for thousands of years before stickers existed. I can’t imagine I’m ruining her life with this and I'd rather avoid my admittedly weird phobia if I can.

&#x200B;

AITA upholding a no sticker policy in the house?

&#x200B;

Update: I think you all convinced me I should try therapy, so thank you!! Seriously. There’s no guarantee of success with that, but having a designated “sticker time” while Daddy's running errands seems like a very good stop gap. Based on comments I should reiterate that the “injuries” are totally fake. She’ll ask for a bandaid and have no idea where to put it."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

However, this friend really, deeply wants children. My girlfriend and her friend have a really close relationship, and have had an agreement since before me and her were dating that if it turned out her friend couldn't have children (her siblings all have this condition, so it was likely she would to) then my girlfriend would host her child for her. This would involve an egg fertilized by her friend's husband being implanted in her. I'm very, very, deeply uncomfortable with this. I think her friend is a very good person, but I don't want my girlfriend to carry and birth a child thats not mine. We live together, and although I know i would not have to put as much time and effort and pain into the process as she would, I would still have to care for her and support her as a baby grows in her that's not mine. I very deeply don't want this to happen, and it might be a dealbreaker for our relationship, if I'm being honest with myself.

So my question is, am I in the wrong here? AITA? Please help, I'm really conflicted about whether I have a right to be as uncomfortable as I am about this.

"The title might be a bit misleading, but I couldn't think of better wording and I'm not thinking too clearly ATM since I'm kinda pissed off. Don't worry, nothing NSFW. This is a condensed version of what happened BTW, I'm missing key things out. Of course, as ever, post if you want to know more information.

Just had a confrontation with my mom in the hallway, since I go back to work tomorrow as busboy at my grandfather's restaurant for my summer job (I don't hate it, and have been doing it for two years, but I don't think it's particularly useful for myself or others, but it makes a modest amount of money I use for certain things, but that's irrelevant), and she spontaneously just got angry with me about how I should shut my mouth at work about the things I am studying (my current infatuation is Nuclear Energy, and I don't really shut up about it too much, and I can see how that be annoying). She thinks it'll be alienating to the others and it would seem condescending (she doesn't think they're too educated, which isn't wrong, they're mostly high school graduates who haven't been to college, but that doesn't mean they won't care about what I have to say, since I've gotten along with them quite well), but it's not like I make everything I say as if I know the esoteric bits and the everyone else is a witless layman. Like last year when I was quite into History I often talked about it when nothing else was happening, and they didn't seem to mind, at least I don't think.

Another thing I should mention is that I have these feral cats in my yard that I feed when I can (all spayed/neutered, so the population is manageable). Every time I was at work, I collected any food that people didn't eat and put it in a little container for the cats, and the waiters and waitresses sometimes were willing to help out and add a few bits of food, but my mom thinks that I'll look crazy and disgusting collecting all the food, as if it's for myself. I didn't say anything, as much as I wanted to. The cats aren't going to starve to death if I don't feed them (feral cats are pretty prolific hunters), but I figured it's a more productive way of using the food instead of throwing it in the trash (I would give to a homeless shelter, but there aren't any in my local area AFAIK).

I didn't really say anything for that matter, since, no matter how valid or rational anything I say is, she will just get even more pissed off. I just find it odd since I didn't even do anything yet she's scolding me out of the blue. She kept saying how I'm basically an adult and she's still telling me not do stupid things (I was a pretty energetic and obnoxious kid I'll admit), but I think she's just being irrational and paranoid.

So would I be an asshole if I were to talk about my current interests and collect food for the feral cats? I wanna see other opinions."	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

The people I’m talking about were 14m, 14m, 15m and myself 16f at the time. All three of them are Russian. I don’t post much on reddit so my formatting may be poor.

Lets call the first 14m Sven, the second 14m Faendal and the 15m Balgruuf. I sit in the back of the class, that’s constantly noisy, even though we have only 12 people including myself. It’s late October early November so the weather is kind of chilly for me, maybe around a 65-70F (I don’t retain body heat well due to my hemophilia so either is really cold or really hot). Balgruuf said he was hot and wanted the AC on. I said to just open the door and window, though I was ignored I presumed. Faendal who was right next to the closed window still went over and turned on the AC. I promptly exclaimed “If you want it so cold, then move back to Russia.” Sven, Faendal, and Balgruuf got all up in arms because of my comment. My memory about the encounter fades at around that moment, though nothing was physical and the shouting lasted for about a minute longer, with the AC still blasting.

I don’t generally think about Russians that way, hell I’ve been trying to learn their language in my little free time. I had multiple other run ins with specifically Sven later in the year, though not with Balgruuf and Faendal. I’ll update the post if information needs to be clarified."	Asshole	0	0	19.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

The AC was going to be on but my legs were falling asleep and it was hot in the car already so I asked if I could go in too.

Stepmom: I'm not going to leave stepsister in the car alone, stay with her.

Me: She will be fine she's got the AC and water and you are in a shady spot, my legs are tired and she is kind of annoying.

Stepsister: What if someone comes up to the car.

Me: Start the car alarm. And you can just come inside

Stepmom: No she can't she just took Benadryl and is probably tired.

Stepsister: Yeah I could probably fall asleep right now.

Then my step mom started driving off and because we were going to the store to get dessert, my stepsister started complaining and saying she will just go in the store. After the entire time we were in the store she put on a charade of being tired and at one point 'fell asleep' but when we got into the car she immediately was prepped up and excited about the ice cream we got and proceeded to just watch TV and make dessert when we got home and went to bed at around midnight. The entire rest of the day she was mad at me as well as my stepmom for making her go in the store. And I got called an arse hole by both of them.

c4gp8e	2019-06-24 01:54:58	courtcooker	WIBTA for telling my best friend that her boyfriend is the biggest most manipulative p.o.s. I have ever met?	"Let me start by saying I love my BFF more than anyone on the planet. I would do anything for her. She’s been there for me through some of the worst parts of my life and vice versa. We have lived together all throughout college. 

My BFF and her FF (foreign fuckhead) met last year and began dating about a month after. That struck me as odd bc she has never been the kind of person to jump into relationships.

When she came back to school (FF went back to his country) I realized how weird their relationship was. He was like a sugar daddy to her (no shade to sugar daddy’s or babies), buying her school stuff, paying tickets, and even paying for her portion of our spring break trip. She has money and barely lets her parents pay for her stuff let alone anyone else. 

When they FaceTimed (at least 3 times a week) she wasn’t allowed to do ANYTHING else while FTing him. Not homework, not chat with us roomies, etc. and they had to FaceTime for AT LEAST 3 or 4 hours. He would get pissed at her and say there was no point of them FTing if they weren’t going to for multiple hours. She neglected homework and sometimes even her job so they could FT when he wanted. 

When I met FF I was literally floored. We took a spring break trip (was supposed to be a girls trip for our senior year—he ended up coming anyway), and I realized how insanely controlling he was. FF wouldn’t let anyone else but him cook dinner, held the WiFi/housecode to our AirBNB hostage until we absolutely needed it (aka BFF begged him to give them to us), got legit mad when we beat him in card games. He disrespected us and her straight to our faces. Called us dumb Americans, insulted us, called us rude nicknames. 

He doesn’t allow her to smoke (e-cig, weed) but he smokes a pack of cigs a day. She smokes weed and cigs like every day but hides it from him so FF doesn’t get mad. 

FF gets mad when we would get more attention from her than he would (not texting back fast enough, hanging out with us rather than FTing him). 

I want to tell her all this now bc he has convinced her out of her dream of traveling the world to instead move to his country and live in his parents basement with him. 

A year ago she would have never given a SECOND to anyone that tried to convince her out of traveling the world. It’s her dream. It’s like he’s got her hypnotized. And after seeing his verbal and controlling abusiveness I’m also a bit scared he may fall into mentally or physically abusing her in the future. 

I want to tell her all of this but she is so lovestruck by FF that I think she would stop speaking to me if I confronted her about it. Would I be the asshole if I DID tell her how I felt? 

TLDR; best friend is lovestruck and manipulated by controlling boyfriend into abandoning her lifelong dreams. WIBTA by telling her what a piece of scum he is even if it means she might not speak to me again?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	48.0	35.0	0.0	0.0

For her bachelorette she wants to go to a festival across the border. We bought tickets and pitched in for a trailer, etc. After doing this planning, I officially became a lawyer. She has been talking about wanting to do drugs while we are there and I’m just not into that scene. 

Originally I said I would maybe just drive myself there so I wouldn’t have to worry about any forgotten remnants of drugs being discovered when we cross the border to go home, but the more I think about it the more uncomfortable I am with the whole thing. I called my friend today and told her I just couldn’t risk going because of the recent developments in my career and I just felt it was too much of a risk to even be around illegal drugs in a foreign country. 

There were many tears shed during this conversation (from both sides). I do feel bad for not going but from my perspective there are only two outcomes if I go : 1) everyone either hides drugs or leaves me by myself while they go do them, or 2) everyone is annoyed that they can’t do them because I’m there. Neither is a good option. I’m also just not comfortable around that kind of stuff because I don’t participate in it and now my career is at stake. 

My friend is very upset with me for not going and I do feel bad.. I’ve told her I’d plan something for her in town to make up for it and all the people who couldn’t go to the festival can come to that, but she snapped at me saying she’s too busy. AITA for not going on this trip? 

Also for clarification, I already paid for my share of everything and won’t be asking for any back so I wouldn’t be screwing anyone over by not going.

Edit to add more info: she has now told me she promises there won’t be drugs and asked again if I would go.. I’m still very wary because 1) you can’t make those promises for other people that are going and also do drugs, and 2) there have already been comments made about wanting to do them in the first place."

c4gmug	2019-06-24 01:49:37		WIBTA For blowing up my sisters relationship with our parents	"I love my sister to death I really do, just to get that out of the way

For background, she's 7 years older than me and I recently got my license (March) and I absolutely love to drive. It's therapeutic in a way, it's a good way for me to get out of the house and away from everything so I pretty much drive as much as I possibly can. 

We both smoke weed, she's legal in my country and I am not but she's been smoking since she was my age and lets me smoke with her sometimes. Our parents do not know and would flip their absolute shit if they found out. 

She's just been accepted into law school starting this fall and is pretty excited and my parents are happy for her. 

She and I were driving to her boyfriend's the other day because she was going to a party with him and needed a drive there. No problem. As we're driving we pull over into a spot we often smoke in to smoke a little. I didn't have much at all as I was driving but she smoked a lot for what she usually does. The road we take back to the city from the spot is a long, open road with some gentle corners and a couple small hills. Posted 50km/h but no one goes below 70. I was driving along doing 90-100 which is faster than the posted but I know I can handle it, I drive it all the time and know each corner of that road like the back of my hand. All of the sudden she blows up on me saying that we're going to crash and I need to slow down. She's been in a bad accident before and luckily left with no more than bruises. I didn't know how to react to this suddenly very agitated person and just kept driving. I drop her off at her boyfriend's and we say goodbye and whatnot, seems pretty much fine. I suspect she was freaking out because she was high.

Then today when I come down for supper my mom tells me that I'm not driving any more, at least for a while. Get screamed at my mom and sister, whatever I'll roll with the punches and this will pass. But she knows how much I like to drive and now am not allowed to even drive to work let alone friends houses and such. 

WIBTA if I told my parents she was freaking out because she was super high? I don't know if it's just me seeking revenge or what but I almost told Mom earlier. But I wanted to know from you guys first. Parents finding out could mean no financial aid for uni, or the house she's about to buy in her new city for school, or really anything. My parents can be loose cannons and punishments are often way severe and can be unpredictable. I guess I just want to know if I would be vain to do it or if I should just shut up about it and deal with the consequences of my actions (no changing the fact that I was and do drive fast along that road and others like it, never reckless or out of control, I know my limits and do not push them whatsoever)"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4gmhy	2019-06-24 01:49:01	johnnys_sack	AITA for wearing sandals to an outdoor wedding	"Several years back, my wife's cousin got married. The reception was at the same place as the wedding - an outdoor barn on a farm in Louisiana. The invitation specifically said ""no shorts"".  

It was July and above 90°F outside, and even hotter in the barn or tents.  So, even though I thought that was ridiculous given that it's a barn and hot as balls, I complied and dressed as nice as I could, while trying to stay cool.  Every guy there was sweating like crazy with big sweat marks all over their shirts.  The one thing I did was wear sandals. Not flip flops, but decent looking sandals.  

I figured it was justified since every single woman at the reception had on a dress and open toe shoes.   But I was the only adult male with sandals on.  People were unnecessarily upset with me.  I would have just as soon not gone to the reception at all but it was my wife's side and the expectation was that I had to attend.  To be clear, in no way was I part of the wedding party nor would I be in any wedding pictures, aside from random pictures. 

So, am I the asshole for abiding by the dress code but wearing sandals so that I could be a little bit cooler?"	Asshole	0	0	696.0	18.0	0.0	0.0
c4gle5	2019-06-24 01:47:01		AITA for cutting my two ex-best friends out of my life?	"EBF1 and I had a falling out a year ago bc our mutual friend got really nosy about my breakup and thought we were closer than we actually were. I didn’t want to talk to her about it and she has a very judgey personality (literally said the guy I’m dating is a 6 in looks compared to the POS I broke up w) like who the fuck judges actual people w feelings on a scale like that? Anyway she went to EBF1 and told her some shit about me that caused EBF1 to ignore me for a while and when I messaged her about ignoring me and if we could hang out and she said “Honestly I’d rather just not be friends if I get to avoid all this emotional drama.” K cool not friends anymore bye.

When all this was going down EBF2 told me to “fuck that bitch you’re better off without her. Honestly out of all of us she’s still stayed the same and hasn’t grown up from high school at all in terms of maturity and anything else.” EBF2 and I were closer and known each other for far longer and have gotten through some tough shit together. I’ve put up w her behavior towards me (making me pay for everything, silently judging me and giving me looks when I do something that embarrasses her, telling me I’m stupider than her) for the past year now. She’s recently started acting like that except her sense of superiority has always been a constant. She doesn’t say sorry when she does something wrong. She instead immediately puts the blame on me for something to detract from what she did. And IMO her worst behavior is she gossips about her “friends” behind their back whenever she’s pissed off about them. She might also tell them to their face. I definitely think she does it about me too.

It sucks because I defend her in front of others when they tell me she isn’t a good person. I have a lot of love in my heart for her and it’s just always been the two of us. Idk. I don’t recognize her anymore. She was an inherently better person growing up. 

Anyway, flash forward to yesterday. I saw a post on social media of the two of them together (we all go to different colleges). This was after I missed EBF2 graduation bc we just aren’t that close anymore. But between when I had my falling out with EBF1, neither of them interacted until yesterday. So I feel like some negative words were said about me that caused them to become closer. I know full well EBF1 doesn’t know shit about what EBF2 said about her behind her back. I know that they deserve each other because they have a lot of the same personality traits. And their negative characteristics (judgmental, gossiping) are why I don’t want them in my life anymore. But I feel left out (they were my only real friends) and that I should just apologize and try to be friends with them again. Am I being picky?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

It's a bland cinder block wall, just shy of 6 feet tall. A number of years ago, he planted a vine that grew out from his yard and over into mine. 

The vine grew over the wall and up, creating a nice privacy barrier. There were also  bright beautiful flowers and bright green leaves. There were hummingbirds and squirrels that would climb all through it and it was always pleasant to watch. 

The vine also provided a really nice bit of shade, so I could sit pretty much anywhere I wanted.

Well today with no warning, my neighbor ripped out the whole thing. So now all the flowers, all the shade, all the privacy, all the birds, all the covering of the bland wall is gone. It will take years and years for something to grow to replace it. Also because it was without warning, I didn't close my windows and I wasn't home. All of the dust and dirt and pollen flew right into my house, so my house is a mess. Also, he didn't bother cleaning up any mess he left on my side of the wall or on the wall itself.

So I want to tell my neighbor that I'm really pissed off that the vine is gone, he's ruined my backyard, it will take years for something to grow to replace it, he made a huge fucking mess, and he didn't tell me he was doing any of it. 

My backyard went from an awesome hangout to a sweltering, shadeless, colorless, animal-less, boring, drab place.

So I’m 22F. I’m in my third year of college right now. I had a fucked up life my entire life, and I was raised by my grandparents until I was 15 and my grandmother died so I had to live with my dad. My biological mother is absuive and I haven’t seen her in 8 years now.

Anyhow, I love my father but I can’t just live at home anymore. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment when it’s me, my stepmom, my two step sisters (23 and 18), my 3 year old niece and two dogs. There’s a huge ant infestation on top of that. I’ve woken up with ants all over myself, and I can’t put a drink down for two seconds without somehow just a bunch of ants appearing right there from another damn dimension it seems like. I sleep in the livingroom with my little sister who up until now we had to share a tiny ass bed.

My step mom is mentally absuive, and a narcissist. She calls me worthless, useless, and screamed at me after I was put on anti depressants. I have severe depression and apart of it is because of her. I’ve cried so many times, and I can’t even get that much into it bc of the limit. My little sister is very disrespectful to me. I can’t even say hi without her giving me attitude. My stepmom also ignores everything I say and I’ve had to hide my phone as she will go through messages and even listen in on phone calls with family members. 

I’ve told my dad all of this. I’ve wanted to move out for years but never had the spine or support to. After being years of told how worthless and incompetent you are, you start to believe it. I WAS supposed to get an apartment back in June, it was the proudest moment of my life... until I got laid off by my job a day before I was supposed to move in.

Anyhow, I’m here now, and I’ve tried so much to explain all this to my dad. All he does is yell at me and tell me I’ve been through worse, and how my step mom isn’t mentally abusive, how I should be grateful for what I have. He literally uses the abuse I’ve suffered as a child as an excuse for my step mother. She hides stuff behind his back. She owes me money for a loan she took out behind his back. I told him all this. He just says it’s his problem and that my step mom loves me. I love my family. I even love my step mom. I don’t want them to break up. But I myself can’t live here anymore. I can’t even go into detail because of the rules here. And now my dad is just upset and he thinks it’s a dumb idea for me to move out since I have a ‘loving family’ and that I don’t have to pay rent here. 

He said fine, that I can move out, but I need to ‘at least’ visit for the holidays, like I’m a monster who just hates her family. I can’t help but feel bad like this is all my fault.

c4gd1n	2019-06-24 01:31:59		AITA for not going to my friend's fiancé's funeral?	"So, I had been very close with this girl we’ll call Wendy for about 15 years prior to what happened. Our families were close, we were likes sisters, we went on vacations, etc. When we got older, she started telling me about this guy at her work she liked but he was married and he was off limits. Then eventually, she admitted that the two had a one-time affair. I didn’t judge at all and I admit I was getting one very biased side (she was bashing his then wife and he was claiming he couldn’t leave her because of their kid…isn’t that what they all say?). But like I said, I was very supportive and didn’t want to make it seem like she couldn’t come to me. However, she said that it ended after that and never mentioned him again.

A few years later her dad died and she pulled away a bit, which is to be understandable. I went to the funeral and was there for her, but there was only so much I could do for her and I knew that she needed space. Then nearly a year a later, she posted on Facebook that her fiancé had died after a battle with cancer. The fiancé was the same man she had the affair with years prior. I had no clue that they had kept up a relationship all these years, let alone that they were engaged. Turned out that hardly anyone in her life knew, except for her mother and a few co-workers, not even a majority of her family knew. I was pretty taken aback that she had kept it a secret. She knows I wouldn’t have told anyone and from what it seemed, he had gotten divorced and there was no reason to keep it a secret.

I had plans the night of the wake and I had to work the day of the funeral. I commented on the post and wrote her a lengthy message, letting her know I was here and explaining that I couldn’t go. I didn’t say this, but if I had known about him, then maybe I would’ve taken off to go. She thanked me for the condolences, but outside that didn’t respond.

We didn’t talk for a while after that which seemed to be our new normal. My mom and her mom had dinner, and I found out from my own that Wendy is mad that I didn’t attend any of the services. Wendy’s mom added, however, that Wendy expects people to know how she felt about this fiancé when she never talked about him.

c4gbci	2019-06-24 01:28:55	bottle_smasher	WIBTA if I kick my mother's relatives out of my apartment because they've been acting like its their own place?	"Last week my mother called to ask if her step cousin and his son from the village could stay at my apartment for about 3 weeks because the son was going to take some tests to apply for scholarships in the city. 

I guess I am what you call a neatfreak. I hate messiness and dirty things. My apartment is always in a clean, deodorized and neat condition. So the thought of having people that I don't really know at my place seemed a bit unpleasant.  
But I could not say no. They have no other relatives here and don't know anybody and staying at a hotel or an inn is too much of a luxury for them. Besides my mother is really close with her stepfather and his family. So I said yes.

They have been staying at my place for almost 2 weeks now. And to say they're lazy is an understatement. They did not do the dishes after breakfast, lunch etc. They let the trash can pile up and overflow its receptacles. There were food crumbs on the counter and all over the kitchen. 
And because I have only one bedroom, I bought a king size matress for them to sleep on in the living room. And they always fell asleep with all the lights and tv on. Not to mention that they always snooze until noon! 

I have tried to talk to them about it many times. I tried to say it politely. ""Could you please do the dishes and take the trash out in the morning?"" and ""Don't forget to turn the tv and all the lights off before you go to bed.""
At first they seem to understand. But after a few days, they always seem to forget somehow, which is frustrating because I feel bad having to tell them all over again. I talked to my Mom about it and she said she understood how upset I was. But they have nobody else to help them and no place else to stay.  She asked me to just put up with it because they're family and they're less educated than I am so they have no idea about what to do when you're staying at someone else's place. I just needed to be the bigger person. Besides it's only for a couple of weeks. 

Last night after a rough day at work, I went home to find them snoring in the living room with all the lights and tv on again. There were empty bottles of beer and cigarette butts scattered around on the floor. I'd tolerated them not doing the dishes and letting the tv on all night long but I decided I've had enough. 

I spoke on the phone today with my Mom and I told her that I will have to tell them to leave if they're still acting like they're in their own house. She was so upset about it. She thinks I am overeacting saying 'It's not like they're going to live there with you forever. It's only for a few weeks, for God's sake.""

c4g9bw	2019-06-24 01:25:13	ArtfulGem	AITA For Avoiding A Relationship W/ My Fathers Side Of Family	"This is long so I will have a TLDR

My father has never been in my life. He only came for Christmas or my birthday, never both, until I was around 10 and he vanished all together.


He decided to reach out when I was almost turning 18 and wants a relationship. Something seems...off to me, but whatever. I don’t mind trying. But he ghosts again.
I stop trying and he reaches out again and I refuse a relationship until he admits his lies he said about my mother (his family asks “hey where is ArtfulGem and he decided to state that my mother kept me away when he and I both know that didn’t happen and he admits that) he avoids it but whatever. I still keep in contact with my uncle, his brother.

I’m trying to give a backstory so you can understand a bit where I’m coming from

Anyways, let’s skip to the current situation.

I am moving into an apartment and the day I was going to put the deposit down, my bank card locked on me (prepaid card since I was 16. Didn’t even realize it was prepaid my mom gave it to me when I started working). They locked it for security purposes since I tried to withdrawal a large amount (over 2K). 
I needed that apartment so I called everyone I could.
I went to my therapist and she convinced me to call my fathers side of the family and basically no help. At all. 

Now a day goes by, I call my father and he’s giving a sob story about how he misses me. Ok...but you promised money. Again, I get it you can’t give but don’t lie to me and I needed it 12 hours ago.
My grandmother calls and says instead of giving money I can live with her. Wtf???? I was like “no” and hung up. Again, she’s disrespectful and controlling and I’m mad my uncle gave her my number.
Three days go by. My father is still promising to send money. At this point, I am done. Like wtf don’t lie to me. I was completely understanding if you don’t have it but why lie and lead me on. It reminds me so much of when I was younger he will promise to visit and a bunch of gifts and never came through. 

I want to make it clear it isn’t about the money, but the principle. Money is hard to come by but I felt that I deserved honesty in such a desperate situation. I feel...used. Like they used that opportunity to try to talk to me after a decade.
Idk. Am I the asshole? Thanks

TLDR: fathers side of family lies about sending money to help in desperate time and I want to avoid the drama they come with. AITA"	Not the A-hole	0	0	107.0	31.0	0.0	0.0
c4g8y2	2019-06-24 01:24:26		AITA for refusing to pay for something I didn’t agree too?	"I’ll try to make this short. Today we had my daughters bday party at one of these local indoor gym places since it’s way too hot to have it outside. This is the 2nd year we’ve gone here in addition to recommending it to friends and family based on our last positive experience. They apparently changed owners since last time and now they suck

We paid $300 for the kids party plus another $150 for food for adults. At the end of the party they said we had to pay an extra $50 for the adults who sat at the tables in the general seating area during the party. They said even though we bought food they still have to pay to sit at the tables. Mind you we’ve spent over $1,000 there in the last year and they want to charge us $50 extra to “rent” the table for 2 hours 

We went around and around in circles with the manager and owner about how ludicrous this is. They said we had to pay it because we signed it as part of the contract. So I asked to see the contract I signed. It mentioned NOTHING about a table rental fee. Then they said we just had to pay for them since it was their “policy”. We continued to refuse but gladly offered to pay for the food and drinks we consumed (obviously). They said our 2 choices were pay up for everything (including the tables) or have the cops called on us.

"I used to have a huge passion for powerlifting, so my husband bought me a weight set, bench, and squat rack. Shortly after I found out I was pregnant, and was advise against strenuous activity due to a slew of potential medical issues that were borderline worrying. 
I am now 4 months postpartum, and while I try to do some living room workouts to try and get back into shape, I haven’t gotten the chance to get back into lifting due to being the primary caregiver and going back to work. 
My husband made a remark to a friend recently saying “yeah I bought her a weight rack and it’s a great dust collector,” to which I snapped “well maybe if you watched the babies for an hour I could go actually get a lift worth while in.” His response was just that he doesn’t want to because he can’t handle both of them at once. 

I’m pretty frustrated with him, l especially because he knows it stresses me out to be alone with them all the time and to not be able to go to the grocery store in peace, and I’ve been having a really hard time accepting my post-baby body. I’ve also been diagnosed with PPD. 

I know it would be petty, but I’m considering it just selling it and spending the money on a massage or something to make myself feel good for once. Honestly, maybe even just make an extra payment on my student loan debt.

c4g4uy	2019-06-24 01:16:54	Longtimefirsttime9	AITA for telling my bosses that it is their fault I didn't meet expectations?	"Backstory:

Been in a sales position 9 months but in this industry in sales for a decade with accolades and one of (if not the) top performers for each of the other companies I worked.   I left my past position because even though it was great money, I would work 50,60,70 hours a week and the toll it was taking on myself and my relationship could not be sustainable.  There was also an insane amount of toxic behavior and it was not healthy to be around it.  

The company I left for suffered a catastrophic business change (that I knew about the whole recruiting process) and this required them to add a salesperson as the previous one bounced.  Even though this was for less money, all the other boxes got checked.  Anyone in my industry would have considered me massively overqualified for this role.  I was excited to help build something anew because I had experience in this exact type of scenario in my past and succeeded.  

Although the company is large, this particular sales team consisted of only myself and another salesperson (who had already been on staff a year), our boss, and our boss's boss.  

Everything about the company has been great, except after I joined I found that my sales goal was 10% higher than the incumbent salesperson.  This did not bother me, as in my previous positions, goals were something of a guide, and not law.  And although I knew the situation of the sales climate was bad coming into it, if was much worse than I could have thought.  I was also pitched on the job of selling mostly 5-6 figure deals, when in fact most of the deals would only be 4.  I don't think I was misled, I just think it was a miscalculation of how bad things were.

I apologize as that was a lot (and there is much more).

Present day and we just came to our year end a week ago.  Our overall sales number was missed by 1.3% and it has hit my boss and my boss's boss like a sack of bricks.  The incumbent salesperson met their goal (and passed it by a small margin) which means I did not.  

I was brought into a meeting with the two bosses, and they said that this goal miss was completely on me and they will need to re-evaluate my employment.  Respectfully, I rebutted that I didn't believe that was fair, as the incumbent sales person with a higher book of business and lead list from the previous years was given a lesser goal than me even with a whole extra 3 months to sell, and most of my revenue was completely new (including the largest new deal in the entire company).  They had said (also respectfully) that I was making excuses and we are all responsible for our goals.  I said I cannot help the goal given to me if it was not set upon realistic standards and calculations and that was the reason I did not meet, not because of me.  

This made them upset, and the meeting ended. saying they would have to evaluate my position.  It has now been a week and I have not gotten a word from either of them.  I am fully expected to be fired.

c4g412	2019-06-24 01:15:22	Marti_Shanon	WIBTA if I threatened to cut contact with my mom if she joins a MLM?	"My mom is currently being courted by her co-worker/friend into joining Essential Bodywear - a new-ish MLM that sells bras. Customers attend parties where the consultant fits them for bras and then sells them. 

I've already explained that it's an MLM, basically a pyramid scheme. She denies this. I've quoted the statistics from studies that state 99% of participants in these companies lose money. Beyond that, my mom's social network exists almost entirely in the office, where this co-worker/friend already sells the bras. It's not as if she can be a casual participant who only sells to friends and family who actually want the products without recruiting more members. She doesn't have many friends/family to sell to or recruit anyway.

The most damning rebuttal she's given me so far is that she loves the bras and has been wearing them exclusively for years. I can't really dispute this.

My plan is to show her all of the resources I can find on /r/antimlm, make her watch John Oliver's video about them, and show her the statistics. Unfortunately, because this is a newer MLM, there aren't a lot of regret stories I can show her. If I show her something about the leggings one or the oils one or whatever, she'll just say those products aren't as good as the bras and that is why people think they're scams. And she thinks John Oliver is a liberal wacko.

If none of that works, and she signs up to sell these bras, WIBTA for cutting contact with her until she's out?

**Edit:** Not sure if anyone will see this edit, but I wanted to wait for the votes to settle. I realize now I was having an extreme and emotional reaction not specific to MLMs (though ew) but to the fact that my mom would make a terrible decision in the face of astounding evidence. And also realizing that my mom is the exact type of person to be targeted by MLMs in the first place. 

I'm not going to cut her off completely (though I do want to point out my OP says ""until she's out."" But I am going to refuse to engage regarding the MLM. The last thing I'll say about it to her will be that she needs to track every dollar in and out, including taxes and expenses. 

Some of you asked about my dad - he's against the idea as well, solely because he knows it will cost them money and she already has a shopping problem. But he's never been successful at reigning her in. I'm going to continue to fully support his refusal to participate.

Thanks to /u/Rabid-Sqrl and /u/crittab and /u/e_vil_ginger for the thoughtful responses.

Finally - to anyone who says ""it's only $250"" or ""what's the harm in it"" or ""jesus christ she's your mother and you have no say in her life"" should really do some research about the predatory nature of MLMs and how they can potentially ruin the lives of everyone around you.

c4g2rp	2019-06-24 01:13:02		AITA for refusing to move in with my mom who is having severe financial issues?	"My parents got divorced about five years ago. Ever since then she has been extremely unstable. For awhile she had a great job that paid all her bills, but she quit on a whim. Now she is only working part time.

I just graduated college and have a great job that pays well. I live in a townhouse with a roommate and it’s my safe space. I finally got away from the toxic environment I had while living with my dad while in school. Living on my own has caused my anxiety to lessen significantly.

Every month she asks me for hundreds of dollars to pay her bills and I give it to her and never ask for anything back. Things are getting worse for her and she wants me to get my own place so she can come live with me. She promises that she will pay rent. But she can’t even pay her rent now so my bills would go up while I’m trying to save for my future.

More importantly I’d have to leave an environment where I’m happy to go back to living with my extremely religious mother. I’m 24, I don’t want to live somewhere where I can’t be myself.

c4g16b	2019-06-24 01:09:59	whothefknows21	AITA for being upset that my boyfriend invited two of his female friends on our 22 mile backpacking trip?	"Hi all, I need some opinions on this. My (22F) boyfriend (22M) is a really laid-back, go with the flow kind of guy, so I try often not to let things bother me and just go with the flow, I like that attitude a lot. But something about this just doesn't sit right with me.

I am big into hiking, running, backpacking, etc. My boyfriend is not so much. About a week ago he mentioned we should do this popular backpacking trip near our city. It is a 22-mile backpacking trip, so hike one day, spend the night, hike the next day. I was thrilled that he actually wanted to do something like this and we have been planning and talking about it for the last week. He is out of town for work so this had been done over text mostly.

We just Facetimed about 20 minutes ago and I just casually asked, ""so what is the plan for next weekend then?"" And he replied, ""Hmm, I talked to my friends and we will head out on Saturday?"" I was confused, there was never, never any mention of friends joining us. I asked, and he said he invited two of his female friends - that I have met maybe once or twice in the 2 years we have been together. I know they are good friends of his, he hangs out with them occasionally and mentions them occasionally, no big deal.

However, I got pretty upset at him. I just thought this was really weird and when you have plans with someone, it's generally polite to discuss with them any changes like this...right? And plus, it puts me in a bit of a weird situation, these are two girls who are best friends that are super good friends with him, so I feel just like the extra outlier on this trip now. If he had discussed it first with me I would probably not have cared at all, but having it unexpectedly shoved in my face with no notice just makes me upset.

AITA for getting mad? Am I just overreacting?

Edit: I texted him after we got off Facetime and explained that I just wish he would have mentioned it beforehand. He said that it was something he had talked to them about a while ago but just never made a plan for it. I asked when he invited them and he said last weekend. So he has known for an entire week - the entire week I even knew about the WHOLE trip. And he never mentioned it?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	32.0	32.0	0.0	0.0

"	A close friend for 4 years, I’ll call F, of mine got a girlfriend, I’ll call GF, a few months ago. We all work at the same job and a handful of employees are in a group chat together. Almost everyone at the job disliked GF for a while because of how she acts and that apparently she isn’t good at the job. Her ex also mentioned that she was manipulative and controlling, but they both say that about each other. GF has also stated that she doesn’t want to meet any of F’s friends for reasons that are beyond me. 		
	Well recently me and some friends were all together at F’s house and GF came a few hours in with one of her friends/coworker. She doesn’t talk to anyone besides F, her friend, and me once. She walked off seemingly upset and near the end of the night she left without saying much which seemed to put F in a bad mood, which made me upset as I already disliked her and seeing what seemed like her guilt tripping him made me angry. Later after we had all left F’s house, I started to tell my side of the story from the night in the work group chat (F and GF left the chat a few weeks prior due to an unrelated issue) and that got people in that chat upset with her. 
	The next day comes and F called me asking what I put in the chat because people were messaging her saying stuff. I tell him what I put and he tells me to tell everyone in the chat that I had the story wrong and that I didn’t understand that it wasn’t that serious. I sent several messages in the chat saying that I got the story wrong and that nobody should hold her accountable because I ducked up. Everyone still seems intent on telling her how much they have disliked her and now F wont respond to any texts or calls from me. I feel like F is going to think that I’m the cause of everyone hating her when in reality, everyone hasn’t liked her for awhile but just haven’t said anything to her directly. 
	I just wanted to vent my anger to some people but I feel like I might have screwed up F’s trust towards me and that I probably ruined our friendship over something this trivial.

c4fz3q	2019-06-24 01:06:18		AITA for telling my roommate to put away her dishes and ending the friendship?	Small backstory: my roommate at the time did not use the dishwasher but preferred to wash by hand. No big deal, except the drying rack was often piled high with her clean dishes. One day we went out together and then came and were talking in the kitchen. I went to refill the brita filter, and put the brita in the sink. The vibrations of the brita hitting the sink somehow must have shook the drying rack on the other side of the sink and caused one of her cups at the top to topple down and break. Glass was everywhere and we both started cleaning it up. After the glass was cleaned up, my roommate walked back towards her room and I said “hey aren’t you going to put away the rest of your dishes?” She stared at me and I said “we don’t want to clean up anymore glass tonight haha goodnight!” I didn’t think much of it at the time but then over the next few days she would barely acknowledge me/ talk to me. I asked what was wrong and she brushed it off and didn’t want to talk about. 4 days later she sent me a long winded text message about how she needed time to process how to article that I disregarded her feelings and did not acknowledge my role in the “cup breaking incident” and wanted me to apologize. At this point I was so fed up from trying to talk to her and being frozen out that I refused to apologize to her liking. I said I was sorry that she was hurt by what I said, but I wasn’t sorry for saying it. She was not okay with this and wanted to keep talking/arguing until we agreed. Eventually I said we aren’t going to agree on this so let’s just drop it. After this she refused to speak to me for the remaining 4 months of our lease.

Whenever I want to leave my house around 6pm or something and I tell my mom, sometimes she says no because she wants to sleep and that she has a hard time sleeping when I'm not around, My mom goes to bed or takes naps fine when im at school or my dads at work or my sister is at work but when I wanna ride my bike when its 6 she flips shit and says why didn't you go earlier and no matter what I say she wont let me go. like today at 5:35pm I wanted to go to a giant ass thrift store which I told her yesterday that I was going to so I could get new jeans for myself for cheap. but today right as I was about to leave and I told her, she said no because she wants to sleep and that I should've gone earlier. It really pisses me off because I could understand if it was like dark out but the sun doesn't set here until 10:30 and I have to conform to her sleep schedule when the sun is bright in the sky. My mom works early in the morning sometimes at 5am so she has to be up at 3am and so she goes to bed at 7pm. A month ago when I was looking around for a new bike I found this store that was only open every other day between 6-9pm and on weekends 1-5pm and I decided to go on Tuesday when it was open, so at 5pm I told my mom I was going and she said no because she wanted to sleep and that I should've gone earlier so I explained to her that it was only open certain times every day and that I was only home from school for an hour before I was leaving but she still told me no so I asked her if I could go on Thursday another day when it was open and she said I couldn't because she worked early on that day too and so I would have to wait for another 4 days to go to this store just because she sleeps better when I'm home when I could go right now. so I told her that I am going right now and that I dont care what she thinks, and then we argued and she starts crying and tells me to just go, so I did, when I got back at around 7:30 she was awake and told me how selfish I was and that she was never going to make an exception again. the next day when I got home from school she told me that she had a bad sleep thanks to me and that she was tired all day at work, I really didnt feel bad at all. I would really like to leave my house especially since Im 17 years old and a big boy but Im not trying to start shit with my mom even though I feel like shes just being selfish and difficult. what do you think?

1. It's to humid central Florida in July. It's humid enough in the north east US this time of year, let alone in the sea level swamps of Florida.

2. Her parents live in a suburb of the city where we live and we see them/go to their house and stay over at least once a month as it is. 

3. They've rented a house for the trip and they apparently like to cook in every night during vacations instead of going out for dinner. In my family eating at restaurants and trying new food is basically the entire point of traveling, aside from staying somewhere where we don't have to make our beds or clean up the kitchen.

4. Her parents best friends and their high school age kids are coming and staying in the adjacent house.

5. We're sleeping in a full size bed, which is smaller than the queen we sleep in at home.

6. Her parents had her really young and she's a few years younger than me, so they are really only about 15 years older than me and they love to put on western style shirts and true religion jeans and go get liquored up and scream Journey karaoke and shoot pool with their best friends every night and that's not really my idea of fun.

7. My girlfriend's younger sister and her boyfriend are coming too and gf and her sister bicker constantly and there's already been some heated exchanges about who gets the room with the full sized bed or one with two twins. 

8. I just started a new job 2 months ago and am not super excited to be taking time off so early.

9. I'm an introvert and her entire family is extroverts who have no problem banging on my door in the morning to tell me it's time to go do activities.

They're really nice people and I like my girlfriend a lot but I feel guilty just smiling and nodding every time she asks if I'm ""sooo excited"" for vacation. I just can't help thinking that I'm wasting my money and vacation time to go spend a week living a worse, more claustrophobic, more humid version of the life I would be living anyway if I just stayed here.

c4fqqn	2019-06-24 00:51:55	bbthrowawaysx	AITA for asking my sister to be discreet about her polyamorous (Male-Female-Female) relationship in front of the kids?	"I guess it should be are “we” the assholes, but idk if that’s an accepted acronym here. 

Apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but I’ll try to lay it out as best I can. 

My family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My husband and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

It will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids’ ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

We initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who I think they’ve been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

My sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and I don’t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I’m conflicted though. She’s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

So about 3 years ago I met this guy in high school and we became really close friends. Tbh I think we both had crushed on each other.  I moved away after a year of knowing him and we would just text. Anyways, the time we talked it was always in a friend way, but at one point he began to get I guess too “comfortable” with me and started asking and saying some really weird and personal things/questions. So I eventually got too weirded out by him and slowly started talking to him less and being a bit cold when he would get weird. One time, and for context : he’s Chinese and I was learning Chinese, he got mad at me and literally wrote to me in Chinese  “fuck your mother” and stopped texting me for a long while. He would then randomly message me every few months but at that point I wanted nothing to do with him anymore. The last time he messaged me was almost a year ago so I’m hoping he finally understood the message. Was I in the wrong for just not answering/ being cold until he stopped messaging me?"

c4fljk	2019-06-24 00:43:09	YS2ElectricBoogaloo	AITA for how I worded my apologies?	"Compact background story:

A friend's dad is dying. He lives an hour from hospice which is close to my place so I asked if he wanted to stay here. I also lent him some money to help take care of his dad. (He didn't ask, I offered because I had emergency cash available).

While he's been here his brothers keep getting into trouble and he feels like it's his job to bail them out (literally, at this point). A few nights ago I lent him more cash to keep one from being on the street after getting evicted.  So when he asked for bail money for the other one this morning I don't have any left to give without dipping into my bill money.

When he got home he didn't want to talk about it and was in a bad mood so I left. 

Then he started texting me. He was venting about how everything was too much and the stress was making him crazy, but when I tried to tell him it shouldn't be all his responsibility he didn't want to talk about it. But then he'd keep ranting. Then he says he's not going to be here when I get back. At this point I can't figure out where his head is or what he wants from me so I assume he's mad at me for not giving him the bail money.

Here's where I might have been the asshole:

""I know your mad at me but I've done all I Can without fucking myself completely over. 

And I like you and I do care about you and your situation but I can't make myself responsible for your brothers. I don't have the resources and I just now started getting my credit fixed from where my ex basically set it all on fire.

If I had more cash that wasn't marked for bills I would let you have it. But I don't. I already took money from my hospital bill I can't take any more away""

He took this as me calling him a ""beggar"" (his words) and reminded me that he'd never asked for anything before today. 

I was trying to explain why I couldn't help but now I'm afraid I said it in a way that was shaming him for the money he's borrowed already. That's why I'm afraid I might be the Asshole.

And then when he got mad at me for that text I think I was even more of an asshole when I tried to explain what I meant:

""It just feels like you want help I can't give you. Sorry""

At this point he's basically acting like I've turned on him or something so I know I fucked up. So I stop trying to explain mostly and just keep saying ok.

Now he's left and not talking to me and I think I just made his already stressful life worse. And it feels like I don't know how to properly apologize without making it even more worse so I just let him go.

I didn't mean to shame him or make him feel worse but I think maybe I did anyway and I'm afraid I'm the Asshole.

c4fjps	2019-06-24 00:39:57	TheFamilyMistake	WIBTA if I keep avoiding contact with my mother?	"Hello there!

The families look like this. 

-Dad. 

-Katrina. Dad’s partner

-And me.


Then there’s

-Mom. 

-POS, for Piece Of Shit. 

-Brother, 4. 

-Sister, 2.

At the moment I’m living at my dad’s house. I have been for eight months now. In November of last year I was at mom's house. I was baking. What I first wanted to make were honey cakes. Sounds tasty, right? I looked through the whole kitchen, only two find two cans of brown two-year old honey. 

I decided to scrap the honey cakes and make a mudcake instead. As I'm baking I remember Katrina, and I thought it'd be fun to call her. So I do. I bake with Katrina on speaker on my phone, talking about the honey and whatnot. 

As I hang up, I notice my mother standing in the doorway. She decides the course of action to take is drive me out to my dad’s house. 

Now, before I hear you say that I’m the asshole there’s more to the story. I promise that all I’m mentioning here is a part of the reason I don’t want to see her. 

Another time I was at home. I can’t remember if it was because I was sick or we had a break, but it was a weekday. I know this because mom was working that day. I noticed that it was quiet in the house, a little too quiet for a house with two toddlers. “Oh well,” I say. “They might be outside.” 

So I get up and decide to go look for them. After I look through our whole property, the basement, and even up in the woods, I realised that no one else but me is home. I’m a bit upset at that point that they didn’t leave a note nor send a message to my phone. 

An hour passes and no one is home. I text mom. “Hey mom, where’s POS, brother and sister?”

“Oh, hey honey! They’re at [island], they will be home later tonight.” 

What the fuck? They left for [island] and planned to leave me alone at home for the whole fucking day? 

I call Katrina, since dad’s out of the country working, and explained the situation to her. Of course she jumps in the car and gets me right away so that I wouldn’t have to be alone. I spent the day at dad’s house, doing usual stuff with Katrina. i.e. go out walking, help around the house etc. After a few hours she drives me back because POS is on his way. 

I say goodbye to Katrina and head inside to my room. As I get there I get a text from her. “Hey, we passed POS on the road. He looks mad, so you’re prepared for that.” I thank them for the heads up. 

As mom gets home later she comes straight to my room. She confronts me and asks me why I called Katrina, then gets pissed at me. I get pissed as well, because I believed I did the right thing and she has no right to leave me at home a whole day.

A few months ago I started attending a youth group at church. These gatherings are at Fridays from seven thirty, and end around midnight. During these gatherings my mom ALWAYS texts me. Sometimes a few words, sometimes a heart emoji. I hate this.

Today my gf told me that she ended up taking a nap with her head on his leg but she said this was nothing and nothing happened that day.

She also said that around 2 months ago he texted her asking normal stuff at first like how is she doing, how is Thomas (our son), but he ended up talking about the party, that he had a lot of fun and said ""well, if you have any trouble sleeping you can call me""

When she told me this I just stopped talking and backed off, I just need some space because I was angry at both of them, him for hitting on her and her for not telling me what happened at the party and when he texted her. She said I overreacted and said I'm wrong for being so cold to her.

If I've meet them before and know them then I honestly don't care about it. The problem I have is when a man I don't know sleeps over. This happens quite a bit. 

I don't want to seem hypocritical however because I'll often have my boyfriend sleep over and forget to tell her (I honestly almost never tell her) 

I wake up very very early and it disrupts my morning routine to have a stranger try and leave my house while I'm getting ready. It also kind of scares me sometimes. 

I really really don't want to seem hypocritical or judgy of her lifestyle (I'm worried that's how it would come across). All I would really like is a warning. I mean I've woken up to my bed shaking (we share a wall) several times. It's really annoying. 

Again my main problem is not that the people are there but that it often scares me when someone I don't know is in the house of I hear a man I don't know's voice in the middle of the night. I just would feel hypocritical since my boyfriend spends the night a lot."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"So last night my friend had a sleepover, & since I’m a guy & she’s a girl, I couldn’t attend. So earlier today I got a text from a different friend who let me know that friend 1 was making prank calls last night, & after she called all of our friends she called some random person.

So the random person picked up the phone, & I don’t know what my friend said except for “I saw you at a gym”, because I saw a screenshot of after the phone call in which the person asked “what gym?”, & “Who are you?” My friend then responded with a photo of me from 10th grade, and says “A secret admirer”. The person then responds and says,  “if you don’t say who you are, I will block this number.”

So when I found out earlier today, I texted my friend and asked if there was anything she wanted to tell me, since she normally can’t handle pressure & always falls apart. She didn’t respond, so I clarified by adding something about using my photo without asking me. There was still no response.

At the time I was also texting my gf, & I remembered something my friend & I talked about. The day I told her that I had a gone on a date with my gf, she said don’t tell my gf anything embarrassing about my friend, cause she wanted to make a good first impression, for some weird reason. So I told her I tell my gf anything as long as she didn’t use my picture for anything, because if she had her way, she would have pictures of me all over the place (& no she isn’t into me. I asked her out last year & she shut me down).

So 20 minutes, I was saying if she didn’t respond in like 10 minutes, I would tell my gf that she was a weirdo. She didn’t respond, so I told my gf what was happening now, that was all I said, cause I do like our friendship. My gf agreed after I sent her screenshots.

So my friend responded, & was saying she thought we were friends, why would I bad mouth her to my gf, & why I got upset about her sending my photo to a random stranger. She was then saying she was upset at me for telling my gf about her. 

She hasn’t responded to my latest text which was explaining why I was upset with her, & how me telling my gf was a taste of her own medicine. But while I was waiting for her reply, I figured I would ask for other people’s opinions.

TL;DR my friend sent a photo to me after I made a deal with her to not use my photo for anything & I wouldn’t tell my gf about her weird antics, so I gave her a taste of her own medicine."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We both live in the same city and have both been dating people for close to 3 years. My brother just moved into a house with his GF (29F) which is about 12 min away from my apartment. Me and the GF have had issues throughout the past couple of years. I think she can be uptight and sometimes rude. She thinks I can be too free spirited and impulsive (from what I can pick up and from conversations with my brother). The issues aren’t just between me and the GF either though. Her and my brother have also had multiple problems throughout their time together with her wanting him to be more serious and settle down and him not being fully sure if he wants to commit & having a more relaxed personality. Also, most of our friends and close family that know me, my brother, and the girlfriend all pretty much agree that things seem to go smoother and be more fun when the GF isn’t there (which isn’t often seeing that they live together). Either way, the thing with all this is that most of the issues arise from lifestyle preferences, handling situations differently, etc...not from any one person being a deliberate asshole. Also, my brother is very clear that the GF is a sweet person whom he’s in love with. 

So anyway, with my brother and I being so close and his GF getting on my nerves fairly often, I want to start spending more time with just him or just inviting him to come over and not her. I’ve expressed this to him and we’ve hung out occasionally with just us. But never where there’s other people invited over and she specifically isn’t. I don’t know of anyone else to turn to to ask advice about this situation as most people a) aren’t this close to their sibling b) don’t mind being around their sibling’s SO. It feels rude of me to ask him to come over without her (especially since he’s 33 and lives with her) but I miss my brother and the banter we have when the GF isn’t around.

c4fae8	2019-06-24 00:24:04	CriticalHitKW	WIBTA if I talked to my gaming group about issues with one member?	"Background: I'm in a regular tabletop RPG group that meets ~weekly. Essentially the idea is that it's games based around telling a collective story, where we all play characters in the story. This means that it's a heavily social game, and if you ignore the game you can get lost.

One of the members is just really pissing me off with a lot of the things she does, but I'm not sure if I'm just being petty about it due to my own hangups. Effectively, my biggest issue is that she keeps bringing things to distract herself from the game, like books or podcasts. It doesn't bother me if people get distracted by needing to make a call, or message someone on their phone, or get distracted by a side-conversation or something. But when you actively choose to bring a book to the game, read it during scenes your character is IN, and regularly need to ask ""Sorry, what's happening?"" to try to catch up, it's needlessly detracting from the entire group's experience IMO.

This isn't even like an important assignment thing or a ""Needs to be done by tomorrow"" thing or anything. She wanted to read Dune before the movie came out, but she brought the ~400 page book to the game night and started it at the game.

At the last game night, she even pulled out headphones to listen to a podcast. She only used one earbud, but she was at the end of the table and used the ear that was facing the rest of the group.

She even announced she was bringing a friend to the next game, which also pissed me off. It's fine, and nobody has a problem with it, but I feel like you should ASK about it instead of just declaring that you're doing it.

There's also other small things she does, like interrupt other people or just ignore the group during the initial small-talk phase while everyone is arriving.

I'm not sure whether to bring these issues up with other people in the group, or whether they're just petty and clouded by the first time I met her. She tried to completely change the game dynamic, then got pretty pissed off when she said ""I bet all of you only really play THIS style of game"" and we all told her that wasn't true. (Imagine if a bunch of people who really likes foreign films started a movie night to watch new and different foreign films. They invite a new person who immediately writes a long email on what movies they should watch, and the group disagrees. Then the new person says ""Oh, I bet you all only really watch Action movies or Marvel movies..."", everyone at the table shakes their head and says ""No..."" and the new person snaps and very angrily says ""Don't interrupt me when I'm talking!"")

So is this something worth bringing up? I don't know how other people feel, and I don't want to start anything over petty crap. But I feel like she's just really inconsiderate and disrespectful to the group. And despite being relatively small, that kind of things really pisses me off."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1175.0	37.0	0.0	0.0
c4f8ki	2019-06-24 00:21:01		AITA for not paying rent after my fuckup of a friend lied to me about everything?	"So I'm in my early 20's and recently moved to a new city here in Europe. Moved over to meet a friend who lives there I hadn't seen since school. Obviously hugely dumb on my part but I hadn't much going on after breaking up with my girlfriend so I thought fuck it.

Here's a rundown of how the month went:

•Told me I'd have a job the day I landed. Complete lie.
•Got us evicted from a room we were staying at above a bar because he owed the owner money from his tab. I paid my half for 2 weeks and we stayed 6 days. Didn't get my money back, it went towards his tab. He didn't even pay his full half. I had to deal with an angry owner because he was out drinking.
•Lended him money when I got there before I knew how fucked up he was, didn't pay me back for weeks even though he told me he would the next day. Got angry when I brought it up.
•Got drunk out of his mind every night and woke me up at like 4am most nights coming home.
•Said he would take my dirty clothes to get washed at his friends. Ended up having to wait a week because he couldn't go back to that house as he had a problem with someone who lived there. I was without 90% of my clothes for a week. When I would bring it up he would shout at me.
•We moved into a new room above another bar and he promised he would pay my share for the first two weeks to make up for the bullshit until I found a job. The night before first weeks pay was due he tells me I have to pay it myself. When I tell him he promised me he'd pay for me he gets angry at me again telling me he has a family to pay for and that I'm being an asshole for expecting him to pay for me when he has a family. (He has two kids and an ex gf)
•I left without paying the rent and he has since text me numerous times telling me to pay rent or he's out on his ass. Also rang my heavily pregnant sister complaining about me and blocked me.

So yeah, am I an asshole for not paying my half of rent after this asshole fucked me around? I didn't sign anything with the landlord.

My friend Lily got engaged last fall. Lily and I were good friends in college. I always made the effort to keep in touch after graduation and we seemed fine. She’d invite me to parties she had and vice versa. I wouldn’t say we were BFFs but I’d say we were close.

For context: the last thing Lily invited me to was her birthday dinner in 2017. It wasn’t like a super fancy thing. I was a bit of a sloppy drunk back then and ended up vomiting pretty badly in the restaurant. I didn’t think she held it against me. Since then, I’ve improved my drinking and shown through actions that I’m better and more responsible at handling my alcohol. 

You’ve probably deduced by now that I wasn’t invited to the wedding. I may be overthinking it, but I’m assuming that I wasn’t because of my past. Of course it’s their wedding, their choice who they invite. I swear, I really truly don’t think I’m entitled to an invite. I’m just hurt because she’s not the first person to distance herself from me because of me being a sloppy drunk and I do understand that showing that I’ve improved doesn’t entitle me to any sort of forgiveness. 

But the thing is, the things she invited me to before were casual birthday dinners, house parties, nights at the bar..... I really truly would NEVER go to a WEDDING and get sloppy drunk. 

Now, me and my other friend Jen, who’s mad at her own friend for not inviting her on a birthday trip, are planning a weekend trip with a couple of our friends. And Jen’s and my motivations are to “get back” at our respective friends for leaving us out, even though we know they won’t care. 

I feel so petty and childish that we want to “one-up” our friends over perceived slights. But does it make us assholes for feeling this way? We’ve only really talked about it to each other. We’re not going and running our mouths about “those bitches that left us out.”"	Asshole	0	0	1.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
c4f71g	2019-06-24 00:18:29	cobbbbbbbbbb	AITA for not noticing that my friend was uncomfortable?	"Friday, my friend “Christine” invited “Danielle” and I out drinking with her, her fiancé, her friend “Kara”, and Kara’s boyfriend. Danielle agreed, but had work the next morning so she couldn’t stay out very late or drink too much.

While we were out, Kara ran into “Matt”, a guy she knew from school. Matt seemed nice, so we invited him to join us for the rest of the night. It quickly became clear that Matt was a creep. Since Christine and Kara were both with their boyfriends, Matt turned his attention to Danielle and I. He ended up backing Danielle against a wall and blocked her from the rest of the group, so I reached around Matt to pull Danielle back, while glaring at Matt. Danielle went to the other side of our group to get away from Matt, so he tried hitting on me. I explained that I have a girlfriend and walked away from him. 

Matt ended up asking Christine Danielle and I were dating. Christine was already drunk and didn’t want Matt around her, so she agreed without actually hearing what Matt said. Christine asked Danielle and I if we knew what he said, so I told her. Matt left Danielle and I alone for the rest of the night, but hit on Kara. Kara asked Danielle and I what we said to get him to leave us alone, so again I explained. Danielle didn’t say anything through all of this, but she’s naturally quiet, so I didn’t think anything of it. 

Danielle had said that she wanted to leave around midnight, so when 12:10 came around I tapped her on the shoulder to ask if she was ready to go (since I was leaving with her). Danielle absolutely LOST IT on me, and said “Don’t you dare fucking touch me! I’m sick of you grabbing at me all night, can you fuck off for five goddamn minutes OP?! Just FUCK OFF!” I was shocked, so I asked her what was wrong.  She said “FUCK OFF!”, so I backed off. Five minutes later, Danielle tapped me on the shoulder and said she wanted to leave, so I said a quick goodbye to Christine, who saw everything, and we left. 

In the parking lot I tried asking what was wrong, but she said “I don’t want to fucking talk to you, I just want to get home.” In the car, she said that bringing up her and I “dating” all night had made her uncomfortable. I apologized, and asked her to just tell me that if something like this happened again. She told me to fuck off again, so we rode home in silence. 

I feel like the asshole, but Christine and Kara say Danielle overreacted. I only remember talking about what happened with Matt to answer Christine and Kara’s questions, and I made one offhand comment to Christine about how annoying it was that Matt only left us alone when he thought we were dating. As for “grabbing at her” all night, I touched her twice - to pull her away from Matt, and to get her attention. But I still think I should have noticed that she was uncomfortable, and figured out what was wrong before anything escalated.

I have a complicated relationship with my parents. They have always had the mentality of ""nobody helped me growing up, why should I help you?"" To their credit, they did pay for half of my college and my wedding (which was very modest and not exorbitant by today's standards at all). I also contributed significantly to my own wedding, and have basically paid my way through everything else in life -- car, grad school, etc. There were many times when I struggled, but there was never an offer of help. I am grateful for the contributions they did make. However, my parents are well off financially. They own outright two homes, my father retired years ago after making well into the 6 figures for decades, and they have mentioned several times their savings and trust funds will take care of all of us when they are gone.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this year, and our decision to buy a home. As I mentioned, we had saved for years but homes are obviously still expensive and we approached both my parents and his mother (separately) for equal help with our down payment. We approached my parents with a plan for repayment over five years, so a loan and not a gift. My parents immediately declined, citing the fact that my sister is getting married this year and all their money is tied up in investments. They did not provide a cent. My husband's mother didn't even let us finish the question - she asked us how much we needed and that she would be beyond happy to help. She refused to think of it as a loan and gave us the money outright as a gift. My parents still don't know that my husband's mother decided to help us with the down payment, and we've been walking on eggshells a bit around my mother because she would, without question, react poorly if she found out.

&#x200B;

Since then, my parents have talked about selling their current home and buying something more expensive in a luxurious neighborhood, spent over $10K on a new refrigerator, etc. It has been a little hurtful to watch all of this knowing that they declined to help us. That said, it's their money and they can choose how they want to spend it, and I've accepted that fact. The issue revolves around my MIL.

&#x200B;

We close this week, and we plan to take the obligatory picture of us with our keys on the steps of our new home. We would like to thank my husband's mother for helping make this a reality, but I am afraid it makes me an asshole to do so in a public way knowing my parents will likely get angry about it. On the other hand, why should we hide our gratitude for my MIL just to avoid offending two people who didn't, but could have, helped us? So, WIBTA for publicly thanking my MIL for her support?

EDIT: Going to thank MIL privately and do something nice like have her over to our home for dinner once we move in and are settled. If my mom finds out eventually about MILs gift in some random, innocent way down the road, it won’t be because of me or my husband making it a public fact."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Basically I work at a park and a MASSIVE group of promgoers had come for pictures unexpectedly, so we didn't have extra parking set up. Because everyone was parking illegally and literally blocking my car I had called the rangers to deal with the parking situation so I could get out of there faster.

As they're letting everyone know they've opened up the extra lot and the illegally parked cars must move or be ticketed, some people didn't want to deal with the long walk in their high heels and kept their cars there. Only a couple groups didn't just get a ticket- turns out some had left their, ahem, party supplies visibly in the car and some couples were arrested.

I know technically it's their own fault for leaving that shit out in the open and refusing to move, but I can't help but feel like a dick- the girls must have spent hundreds on their dresses and spent their prom night in jail instead over shit like weed.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about five months and don’t really sleep over at each other’s houses for various reasons.

A week ago my boyfriend spent the night at my house. When the three of us went to bed, my dog was laying at the end of the bed. When I woke up she was sprawled out next to me and my boyfriend was sleeping on the couch. When I asked him why he said it had gotten hot and the bed was too crowded. We laughed about it and joked that I needed a bigger bed.

So my ex and I broke up a while ago, probably around 6 or 7 months and while the breakup itself wasn’t bad there were a lot of mixed emotions about it from both sides (she broke up with me so she could have more time for school, and while I didn’t want it to happen it was probably the right choice for her.) we both wanted and tried to be friends for a little while but she just wasn’t interested or was trying to move on still and wasn’t ready, I wasn’t really sure what was going on with her but that’s my best guess. Recently she started dating a guy at the college she works at (not the same college we’re going to for school.) I don’t really care I mean I’m happy she’s doing well and all but we aren’t super close so like I’m pretty indifferent about it. 

So fast forward to now we haven’t talked for probably around 4 months. We’re both back at college for classes now but in different areas (she’s in the dorms and I’m renting a house with a few other guys) and she texted me asking if it was ok for her new boyfriend to crash at my place when he visits (he goes to the same school they worked at he lives like 1.5-2 hours from where we are.) I’ve met her new boyfriend before, they met through one other person we’re all friends with but he kinda rubs me the wrong way. We have some big ideological and political differences and were basically strangers. Plus he’d have to stay in my room since my room is the only one with a futon/ extra place for someone to sleep. I don’t know why she doesn’t want him staying at her dorm (they have a futon so he could crash there.) I told her I don’t know if I’d be comfortable with that and she said that I’m being ridiculous. After talking to a few other people I’ve still gotten mixed responses.

This isn’t about like our history either, we didn’t date for very long and we just didn’t have a lot of extra time with school. There wasn’t any hard feelings or anything like that and we’ve both moved on. So AITA for not wanting to host her new boyfriend when he visits her?

c4f2pk	2019-06-24 00:11:14	adjectived	AITA I don't put down the spout diverter after taking a shower	"So apparently the thing on the tub faucet that switches between releasing water out of the tub faucet or the shower head is called a spout diverter, and I don't put it down after showering. This is a super minor issue and me and my roommate are not mad at each other at all over this but I'm curious what the internet has to say.

&#x200B;

The way I've always showered is from outside the shower I lean slightly in pull up the spout diverter (set to shower), turn on the shower wait for it to warm up and then get in. I didn't realize that several of my roommates use the shower differently, such as getting in, immediately turning on the shower not checking the spout diverter but expecting it to be down, then waiting for it to warm up before setting it to shower or getting in the shower fully dressed to fill up a large bottle from the faucet (to water plants or fill up a fish tank) then turning on the shower (once again without checking the spout diverter).

&#x200B;

Thus a couple of times my roommates have gotten blasted with cold water and were a bit annoyed. One of them thinks the onus of putting the spout diverter down should be on me whereas I think its just on whoever turns on the shower to check that its in the right mode. Not saying I will purposefully not put it down but this is a super minor thing and a hard habit to break for both of us. I never put it down and always check that its up before turning on the shower and my roommate always puts it down and never checks if its up before turning on the shower.

&#x200B;

So AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Pretty much all spout diverters naturally go down when you turn off the shower but there's something wrong with our shower or maybe a little rust getting in the way cause ours doesn't."	Not the A-hole	0	0	32.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

Today I had a shift with 2 girls that I had never met. The first incident was with girl 1 who apparently talked/asked idk said something to me and I didn’t hear her so I didn’t answer and she assumed that I just ignored her and went to our shift manager and other coworkers to say how rude I am and that I ignored her so the shift manager came up to me to tell me how I should always pay attention to what my coworkers are saying to me and always answer them when they talk to me, etc. All confused I ask what happened and she explains. She was understanding and realized it was just a misunderstanding and the girl was just being bitchy so it ended there. 
Hours later, it’s 10 minutes past the end of my shift, and girl 2 another shift lead is busy making coffees so I just quickly say “ it’s 6, I’m clocking out” and just go to clock out on the ipad where we clock out from. She comes up to me and says in a really pissy tone “Usually before we leave we ask if there’s something left someone wants us to do before we leave, so when you said that I was like ughhh”. Understandable, I say I’m sorry, didn’t know they do that at my old job people would just walk out not even say goodbye sometimes so I’m used to that and didn’t mean for it to sound bad if it did. She seemed pretty fine after but it still left me with a sour feeling.  I didn’t use a bad tone + there was really nothing left for me to do so I don’t understand why it bothered her so much.
 So now I’m just frustrated because I don’t know if it’s me whose too blunt/rude or they are just sensitive ass bitches.

c4ewxu	2019-06-24 00:01:26	chupacabrapeluda	AITA for snapping at a mom because of what her baby did?	"  

Throw away account and all that.

This happened a few years ago and I've always wondered if I was an a-hole.

Was on vacation with my family and we got up really early, drove to a national park a few hours away, hiked a lot, and then headed back towards our hotel at night. We were all exhausted (me especially, as I did all the driving the entire day) and hungry and looked for a place to eat we entered the city again.

We chose one of those salad places where you get your salad first and then pay.

There are 2 sides of the salad bar you can go on with a register at each end. My lady and our 2 teenage daughters are going down the line, with me behind them. 

A young mom, her dad, and the mom's 1 year-old girl come in line behind me. Grandpa is holding the baby and is right next to me with the mom behind him. When I say right next to me, I mean like practically touching shoulders. The baby is holding a little stuffed toy, so of course it's in her mouth.

Suddenly a slobbery wet toy lands in my plate. I just stared at this uninvited topping on my salad. Grandpa picks up the toy from my plate. I honestly don't recall if he said anything beyond ”oops"" or something else non-apologetic.

I was really annoyed, but not mad. He really should have seen this coming and been a little more careful, but whatever. I sighed and walked to the back of the line, handed an employee my plate and said, ""Can I give this to you? *Something* was dropped on my plate."" I might have put a little snark on the ""something.""

Of course the mom heard me and was not happy. I don't recall the exact conversation, but it went something like:

Mom: ""She's just a baby!""

Me: ""And I didn't say anything to you.""

I took a new plate and went on the other side of the line so I wouldn't have to stand next to them, forgetting I'd have to pay separately at the end of the line since my lady and our girls were almost to their register.

Mom: ""What kind of person would get mad at a baby?""

Me: ""Maybe you should watch your kid better.""

She said something else I don't recall, but I replied in a very tired voice, ""I've been driving all day, I'm exhausted, I just want to eat."" She said something else I don’t recall, but never apologized. I started getting those angry shakes and just said, ""Be a parent!"" That was it.

By now, my lady is ready to pay on her side and looking at me wondering WTF was I doing on the other side. She didn't see/hear anything that happened.

Meanwhile, a lady that was now behind me in line witnessed the last half of what happened and said, ""I'm sorry you're having a bad day"" and offered me a coupon. I couldn't tell if she was siding with me or just trying to diffuse my frustration.

"My nephew is 21 and got a seasonal job this summer that my husband and I are far closer to than his parents and we love spending time with him and have a spare room, so we have an agreement he can stay with us for the summer paying a small rent, we get ahead on our mortgage, he gets a good place for way cheaper than any apartment would be. We only live 40 miles from my sister, but that makes a huge commuting difference. 

A couple weeks ago I caught him smoking marijuana in his room. It's not legal in our state but decriminalized and hardly enforced in my city. I told him he could do it as long as he doesn't bring in any amount over the decriminalized limit. I don't give a shit about marijuana despite not using it, I've let friends use it at our house before.

Talking to my sister recently she asked if he had been using any, she found some in his room at home and he's not allowed to have it. Frankly I don't think it's her business, he's an adult, he might live with her most of the year (he goes to community college and worked a part time retail job before this summer) but she doesn't get to control what he does outside of her house. Plus I think it's silly he's allowed to get drunk but not have a joint even if he can legally drink alcohol, and if I didn't allow it in the house he'd probably just go smoke it somewhere else less safely. My husband thinks this is absurd and said he'll never snitch.

So I lied and told her no. Current plan is to always do so. It's a lie, but an asshole move?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

AITA for not wanting to change back to my maiden name after my divorce 8 years ago? Mostly, I kept my married because I don't want to have a different surname to my son, but it's also because I have had this name for most of my adult life and it's part of my identity. Everything I have achieved: my degree, masters, career and being a mother, I have done with this name, so I kept it.

Anyway, I recently started seeing a guy and everything was cool until he learned I was using my ex's name. He didn't say much at first, but gradually he started making little snide comments until eventually he came right out and asked me to change it to my maiden name. I said no. He asked if I would compromise and change it when my son is grown up (we've already agreed to never marry) and I still said no because I feel like it's my name and part of me.

It ended in a row with him giving me an ultimatum that either I change it or we're through as he did want his gf to have another man's name, to which, I told him we were through as I didn't want to be with anyone who would give me an ultimatum.

I don't think I'm in the wrong, but since we broke up, his sister and friends have messaged me and met me in the street and told me that I was unreasonable and wouldn't see things from his side. Am I the asshole?

TL;DR I kept my married name after my divorce but my new partner wanted me to change it. I feel like the name is mine and apart of me, so I don't want to change it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	7.0	4.0	0.0	0.0
c4elnk	2019-06-23 23:42:30	atx78660	WIBTA if I raised my roommate’s rent for not setting the alarm?	"Ok, let’s start with the backstory. Bear with me. I bought a house a couple of years ago and a couple of my good friends were looking for a place to live so we decided to all live in said house. It benefited them in that I wouldn’t charge unfair rent and they wouldn’t have to sign a contract so they could move out whenever they needed/wanted to, and it benefited me in that their rent would help out with the mortgage. They basically rent a room and fill it with their belongings and I furnish everything else (kitchen table, couch, common areas, etc)

Once the dust had settled and everything had been decided, both pay the same amount ($600 even per month). This covered rent, all utilities, internet, TV, etc. All my other friends say that it’s a steal and my friend-roommates are lucky to be paying so little. My total expenses per month are a LOT more than $1,800 so I’m not even charging them a third of everything. And I’m fine with that. I don’t want them to think of me as one of those asshole landlords who is charging an arm and a leg and making money hand over fist. Like I said, this is meant to be a “friends helping friends” situation. 

We live in a pretty safe neighborhood, but unfortunately, recently, our neighborhood has seen a string of burglaries. One happened literally three doors down. So I called ADT and had cameras installed in the front yard, back yard, a Ring doorbell, as well as the usual door and window sensors, etc. Even with this added expense, everyone’s rent stayed at $600. 

As far as rules go, i feel I’m pretty lenient. I’m not going to call you out for leaving your light on, or leaving the computer on all day, or anything like that. I have 2 rules. 1) Always keep the door locked. Even when you’re home. So many videos from neighbors showing strangers just walking in to the wrong house. 2) If you’re the last one to leave the house, set the alarm. 

One of the friend-roommates, we’ll call him Joe, can be pretty combative. I had to argue with him til I was blue in the face regarding locking the door, he eventually, and very reluctantly, agreed. Getting him to set the alarm has been a challenge; he does it if he’s gone for a long time (hours) but if he is going to get groceries or pick up food, he doesn’t. And every time I call him out, he gets super annoyed and says something to the effect of “I was only gone 30 minutes”. In my mind, 30 minutes is more than enough time to break in, especially if the burglars are staking out (which all the evidence alluded to with the recent break ins). I don’t feel like I’m asking too much. It’s an app. Literally 2 taps and you’re done. 

WIBTA for raising his rent if he continues to not  comply? Any other ideas for getting him to follow the rule? I feel like a dog that’s all bark no bite since I haven’t done anything about it.

c4ejwy	2019-06-23 23:39:30		AITA for being pissed at a wedding invitation	"Throw away because I have no idea who uses what.  Also mobile, so excuse formatting.

Background is mildly important here:

Cousin is from my mother's side (uncle is my mom's brother).

My cousin and I were vaguely close when we were growing up despite an age difference.  We were closer a few years ago, including my being one of the only family members to support her getting married.  Drove there and back over a weekend to be there.  He seemed to be a good guy but who knows (didn't know him well).  They were living with my aunt and uncle and given that my aunt is a horrible shrew, we can only surmise she is the reason they were only married a year or so.  

Said cousin did not come to my wedding due to ""work"" despite RSVP'ING.  I feel I also need to mention I got strong armed by my mother into having her sister in the wedding because aunt and uncle were bitching at my adult only (except kids in wedding) reception.

I haven't seen her since before my wedding at this point and I've really cut them all out of my life; mostly FB since phone calls and texting were a think for a very short time in our relationship.  They can barely be bothered to visit my grandma once a year (live a few states over).

That's was almost 4 years ago at this point.  I've moved and even have gone as far as that my Grandma doesn't have our address to keep her from sharing it with them.

Futle effort.  Cousin can obviously use the internet and tracked us down.  The invite for her new wedding came yesterday and I'm just pissed.  

My knee jerk reaction is to unleash all the feelings, but I will just end up with a 'no' to RSVP.  I know it won't end there, I will still hear about but I'm sorry; I supported you when no one else did and you couldn't be bothered to come to my own wedding why should I go to your second?

AITA?  I'm not good at navigating family shit as I typically have no back bone when it comes to this type of stuff.  Am I just being (to me justifiably) petty?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My dad is a severe alcoholic and as of the last two weeks my mom has been in the ICU with some pretty serious health issues. I never smoke indoors, and usually try to place myself out of the way of eyesight and open windows. My dad has told me he doesn't want me smoking on the property, but at the same time its illegal to smoke (weed) in public places. My dads alcoholism regularly sends him to the hospital and he is currently not working. I just want to take some time to relax after work, and I dont think that I do so excessively.

I don’t have my drivers license yet and I had to quit my job because I moved to my husbands residence in another city. I will start college again next month. Before we married we talkef about the financial situation since I don’t earn money anymore. First, I didn’t want to quit my job thinking about getting my drivers license. I wanted to pay for it myself. But my husband who earns three times as much as me insisted and convinced me to pay for it. It took me long to agree with this. So we got married and the plan was that I will start next month with my license. I had birthday and maybe I just expected something because it was my first together in out home. So he came and said happy birthday and told me that my gift will be the drivers license. He gave me a hug and went back to watch tv. I was disappointed. I didn’t except much, I‘d be happy if he just gave me a single flower or chocolate or something small. Just something which would make me feel that he cares. 
I know his present is something I should be glad, but somehow I’m not pleased and upset.

He came and spoke to me at a party with some others (probably because I was standing alone) and we talked for a bit and then he just left. His friends stayed but he went. He said he would be right back but he didn't come back. We didn't speak for long, but I felt a  connection to him. We had a lot in common and I wanted to speak to him more. 

So I searched up one of the friends names on Facebook (it had been said earlier), went through it, and found him in their friends list. His account was semi public, so you could see some photos and old posts, but not all for some reason. I scrolled for a bit and I learned some things about him without even meaning to. Then I requested some people on the previous friend's list and hoped they'd be friends with him too, and eventually a few accepted (I will admit I did join some's Facebook groups and talk to them in there so they would accept) and then we eventually had mutual friends! So then after a week of this I requested him. He accepted it. I messaged him asking if he was the guy at the party and said how much of a coincidence it is we already had mutual friends and he showed up as a suggestion for me to add (maybe this lie wasn't very good, no). He said yes and we started talking. I watched his favourite shows and listened to his music so we'd have something in common too (I DID legitimately enjoy them, I didn't lie) We then just started talking, he asked me on a date, and now we've been in a great relationship for 8 months. I love him a lot.

c4e83e	2019-06-23 23:19:41	nooraquu	WIBTA If I told a super loud paper boys boss about him, probably eventually making him lose his job?	I have no idea how to word this, English is not my first language. So basically I live in an apartment complex that has its doors locked all the time, so there usually isn't a lot of traffic in our hallway, also my neighbors are wonderfully quiet. It is the exact reason I moved into this place. The only exception to this usual quiet is a paper boy who works for a well known company in my country. The paper boy delivers junk mail, ads and that kinda crap almost daily (not proper mail or anything important, mostly ads), usually three times a week. He usually does this at 3-4AM, right around the time I have come home from work and am trying to get to sleep. This paper boy is also the loudest person I have ever come across. He runs around the hallways, apparently runs into walls and just generally doesn't behave like a person should at 3AM. He is LOUD. Ridiculously loud. I've caught him a few times, told him he should be more quiet as its quite rude to make such a noise at such hours, he told me twice that I should worry about my own life, he's just trying to be efficient in his job and just trying to get it over with as soon as possible, as it is a shit job. It's now come to the point that I wake up nearly every god damn day to him messing about in our hallways, and I can't take it anymore. The problem is that he is a minimum wage worker, also a foreigner. I know if I complain about him to his boss, he's going to at least lose this house from his rounds, and probably his job too. It's gonna be a big pay cut for him, and I'm not sure there's enough of a reason to do this.  It also kinda rubs me the wrong way to be complaining about a person who is clearly just trying to do his best. The noise is still RI-DI-CU-LOUS. WIBTA if I told his boss whats going on?

"Two years ago I moved back in w my parents to go back to school after years of poverty (I was on my own at 18), but things were still bad w them, and I started to realize they had truly endangered me as a kid, so I cut them off and chose to drop out & be homeless. I am disabled.

After being homeless for a year & then broke & scared, I pretended to forgive them but never have, bc they arent sorry or honest about it.  I just wanted to possibly have their safety net & have accepted money. 

Recently an incident happened that made me remember they haven’t changed and block my Dad on my phone. Also recently, I found a great job.

So is it wrong of me if I cut them out of my life? Or at least minimize contact even more? I would fund them if they need it & I can.  but I dont want to do Xmas or weekly lunches or w/e.  Sometimes I wonder if they even actually do want to spend time with me for me and not for appearances.

"I attended a taping of Stephen Colbert this week and was sat next to a reasonably famous comedian (not sure if I should be giving her name here).

In her haste she left her umbrella behind and did not return when the tapping was over. 

I could have found an intern and asked if there was a lost and found especially since I knew the name of the owner but I also knew that my mom really liked this comedian so I decided to take it home with me and give it to her instead.

c4dx9t	2019-06-23 23:01:51	zappy88098	AITA for telling my spouse they can't have a weekly game night?	"After we married, my spouse started a bi-weekly game night leaving me solo (I was invited to join, but declined). Game lasts 5ish hours and game night is sacred it’s a long term RPG & everyone tries hard not to miss

&#x200B;

Then we had a kid and spouse took a break. When kid turned 1, my spouse returned to the bi-weekly game leaving me to parent. Off week was family time. After a few years - about the time our kid got past the terrible 3's and became a cool person - spouse said ""Hey, you're (OP) getting a bi-weekly solo night with kid. I (spouse) want solo time with kid. Lets do this, every other week I'll (spouse) do game night and you (OP) get solo kid night. On the game off week, I'll (spouse) do solo night with kid and you (OP) get night to yourself to make up for game night""

&#x200B;

Kid #2 came and kid #1 starting doing extracurricular stuff outside of school. Spouse took 2-3 months off from game night after kid #2 came along. Once game night restarted, the new plan was to use baby sitter. Game night week, babysitter got baby, I (OP) got solo night w/ older kid, spouse did game night. Off week, babysitter got baby, spouse got solo night with older kid, I got night to myself

&#x200B;

As we move forward, the amount of family time we have erodes. A year ago kid #1's sport schedule changed and a new family schedule started - kid 1 has practice early on a weeknight, too early for fam dinner (we lose another evening as a family) . Spouse says ""I'll (spouse) take kid 1 out for dinner and then to early practice, you (OP) and kid 2 do your own thing"". Then spouse realized they were getting 2 solo nights with kid one so they converted the non-game-night night with kid into solo no kid night for just them. I was OK with this because spouse would invite me to join (date night!) or since this solo night was not as sacred as a game night it was open to being canceled to make up for family time

&#x200B;

Then, spouse makes a friend who learns about game night and says ""I haven't done that in years! We should do one"". And they do on what was the ""off week"". So, now my spouse is playing in 2 games, 5 hours each and now game night is every week. I was invited to join, I declined because I'm not into this stuff. 

&#x200B;

This is where I said it was too much. My spouse claimed I can't tell them what to do with their time. This night (the game off night) was their night and I have no say about them doing a game. I said it was only your solo night b/c of some changes to the packed schedule and I have the right to ask for more family time. I said that based on our current lives (2 working parents of 2 kids who are doing stuff) that you getting a \*weekly\* 5 hr game night was unreasonable. My spouse said this was being manipulative and that I don't have any say in how they spend their time since the night was already theirs

It is understandable if they need something, but whenever people  want me to go anywhere, like a fair or park together, I honestly do not feel like going with them. When I respond that I do not want to go I get dirty looks for it. I don’t get what the appeal is of doing anything with me, especially when I wouldn’t particularly enjoy whatever activity they were speaking about. How should one to expect somebody to enjoy something that they were dragged along to do? I don’t get what is wrong with doing things typically associated with extroverts, (IE, Going out, Eating at resuarants, shopping, or watching movies) alone.

We exchanged numbers and have been talking ever since, a bit of flirty banter here and there etc but it was nothing serious, however sadly one of my close friends has been in love with the guy for a very long time. I genuinely care about her so I told her that we were talking but her reaction was negative even when I said we were speaking in a platonic sense.

She has crushed on him for years and nothings come of it yet I still have an inclination that me talking to him is sketchy and wrong. I told her about the whole sitch and initially only wanted to know him as a friend and thus admittedly STUPIDLY reassured her that she had nothing to worry about - but now me and the guy are getting along really well and I feel terrible in case I catch feelings and something does come of it.

We discussed what high schools we went to, our family life, etc. Soon, the conversation took an awkward turn. Ed and Maggie began talking about their drinking, drugs, and sex. Maggie started talking about how she lost her virginity when she was 13 and how they boy she lost it to was 12. I was starting to feel quite uncomfortable. She was describing how it happened, which is when I interrupted her and politely asked her if she could please save it for later. She gave me a weird look and asked why. I said I didn't want to hear about how she lost her virginity when she was a minor. I explained that I wasn't comfortable hearing about two minors having sex. She did not take this well. An argument ensued, as she told me that ""people f*ck all the time, get over yourself"". I told her that's not the point, and she snaps with ""Keep that up, and you'll stay a virgin"".

Last night, my boyf (19) and I (F18) went to a concert. We were in front-row and it was obviously going to be overcrowded. We got there quite early and it was empty except for maybe thirty other people. This strange man, who must’ve been in his late forties, was also one of the early birds. I’d noticed that he’d been staring at me strangely for the the entirety of the time that we’d waited for the stadium to fill up, but I shrugged it off and stayed close to my boyf. 

Just before the main act was to perform, I felt huge hands grab at my backside. I immediately screamed and looked behind me, and saw that same man standing behind me with a smug look on his face. At this point, my boyf had turned around and when I told him what’d happened, he started raging and wanted to beat the shit out of this man. This man wasn’t in the best of shape, and my boyf is considerably taller and chunkier than most, so I knew that things could only end in one way. I didn’t want anyone in the crowd to get hurt, and a few people were already filming, and I knew that this wouldn’t be good for anyone. Myself and two kind strangers separated the two of them, and I pleaded with my boyf to let it go and for us to just move elsewhere. My boyf could see my point and didn’t want to upset me further, so we moved further away from this man. I cried for a little bit and he asked if I wanted to leave, but I’d waited so long for this concert, so I just sucked it up and continued. 

I just moved away, even though that would mean letting this man go, free to do whatever he wants with other men and women. This is what is eating me up inside. I feel like an asshole for just choosing to almost “excuse” his behaviour, but I honestly didn’t know what to do in the moment. I just wanted to be with someone safe, and being alone with my boyfriend was the only thing I could think of."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c4drdc	2019-06-23 22:52:06	coffeefuckingbeans	AITA for canceling plans because I got really high	"Okay to begin I smoke weed as a way to not indulge in alchohol, cigs, that sort of stuff and I treat it like having a beer after work to wind down instead of other alternatives because its healthier and I enjoy it more but I'm still a light weight.

I smoked half of a joint I was given from a partner of mine and it apparently had really potent dab wax in it(for those who don't know it's highly concentrate weed oil/wax and gets you very high very fast, simple enough) which I didn't remember him telling me but I forget stuff so it's not unusual if he did tell me.

 I had made plans to go over to a friends for a night during that day only a few hours before I started smoking just to chill and hangout for a bit, maybe grab something to eat. I had ended up getting way higher then I thought and called her to let her know the situation. (when i get really really high i get very tired and very loopy, sometimes even pass out randomly with whatever I'm doing and I'm nearly impossible to wake up, compared to being near blackout drunk.) 

She seemed fine with it but it was hard to tell and I asked if we could hand tomorrow on Sunday, even go out to this culture food festival in our city, all expenses on me since we had been looking forward to this hangout and she agreed and wanted to go do that, 

I ended up passing out like I thought I would and the next day I got ready to go to the festival and made all preparations I needed before hand, and of course not smoking. I called to see if she was ready and when I could pick her up to head out and no reply, figure she was asleep or busy so I texted it to her. A few hours passed and I tried all that again; nothing.

Fast forward to 3pm and she didn't call back, text, nothing, and our other friend didn't respond either and I was confused/worried. I finally got a response back at around 6pm in a call her basically saying ""OooOOh sorry I'm too high to come hangout! sounds dumb right? You skipped out on our plans, we skipped yours"" that's the jist and it's a bit more nice then what she actually said and there was more malice from her. She does has bipolar disorder and sometimes gets really mean/malicious and resentful for no reason but I know canceling plans is rude though I'm not sure what to make of this if I'm honest.

I wouldn't have canceled if it was a normal high(again like an equivalent to a after work beer) and my normal type of joint but it wasn't, I wouldn't have been safe to drive and I wouldn't have been able to stay completely conscious, I trust them to take care of my if anything happened but I don't trust anyone else they bring around i don't know if you get what I mean.

(EDIT:: I should have mention I did apologize and was very sorry for canceling! I let her know I didn't feel like I could even make it out there when I was that high or stay awake, I try my very best to be as polite and curtis as possible anytime I cancel or generally anything that could come off in the wrong way, and I'm a definition of a goodie-too-shoes, but sure that's how you spell it but you get the point)

(EDIT 2!:: I smoked at 1pm and the hangout was at 11pm, there was a 10 hour time difference and I wouldn't have driven there even slightly high, but because I got high to a point I knew I would pass out I couldn't have gotten to the hangout safely later or have it it wear off in time. IT WAS NOT ON PURPOSE, it was a misunderstanding with the potency. I hate getting high to the point i pass out and i don't smoke often, maybe once or twice a week.)"

I’ve been making music for just under a year now and I’m not that great yet. About 6 months into making music I found out that about 5 of my close friends would regularly make fun of my music and put it and me down behind my back. They would make laugh about it when I wasn’t there and would never let me come to the studio with them even if I asked, they would act like my friends to me but then insult me behind my back. 


When I found out I immediately cut all contact with every single on of them. I blocked their instagrams snapchats and phone numbers and even missed three of their birthday events I was invited to. No explanation no confrontation just totally ghosted all of them, every once in a while I see them in person and they either try to talk or beckon me over and I just ignore them. 


I told my current girlfriend this and she thinks I was too harsh and I Should have told them my mind instead of just ghosting every single one of them, she especially thinks I was an asshole because one of the people who had made fun of me his mother was in the hospital and I didn’t visit her like I was going to. Despite this I think I’m not an asshole because I have really severe anxiety and they all know it, it took a lot for me to even show them music I had written and recorded my self and they totally ruined my confidence.
Before this I was so happy with myself and looking forward to the future of my music but it totally ruined the way I view it and shattered my trust. It may not sound too deep to some of you but they were my friends and they betrayed me. 


EDIT, EXTRA INFO: 
I found out they were acting like this from people who were with them and from videos of them mentioning me by name and saying things about me and my music. 
There were 3 such videos and all the people were taking part.

I literally CRIED because I was so grateful. Now, my dad starts texting me and telling me he's buying a car and needs to get rid of the old one. I told him I didn't have the money to get it. I live in Oregon and they live in Florida. I told him I didn't expect to have to leave so soon. I just wouldn't have the money to make a trip like that for a few months.

c4dog4	2019-06-23 22:47:17	DankisKhan	AITA for not attending my friend's wedding?	"So this happened just recently, and I'm still struggling with it. It all started about a year and a half ago, when my friend (we'll call him G for groom) and his now wife (B for bride) got engaged when they were juniors in college, and we're thinking about wedding dates in June of 2019. My girlfriend, who I have been dating for 3 years, was the maid of honor in her older sister's wedding, which was in June. They had set a date about a month before G and B had even gotten engaged, and my girlfriend told them multiple times what date it was on, as I had already told her I'd go with her.

My girlfriend and B have some weird history. They were actually best friends for the first year of college, and roomed together their second year, which was convenient because B was dating G, so it was fun to coordinate. I had started dating my girlfriend around this time, and like most couples, we'd spend the night together a lot, always at my house so as not to keep B up or annoy her. 
Around the end of the first semester, B suddenly tells my girlfriend she's gotten new roommates and will be moving in with them at the start of second semester, effectively hanging my girlfriend out to dry. B cited the fact that she was lonely without a roommate, despite the fact I never saw her in their dorm whenever I came over. My girlfriend had to apply for a new roommate through the university, and ended up with a worse roommate. B then started gossiping about my girlfriend and other people, so they stopped talking.

Fast forward to last spring, and G and B get engaged. I knew exactly what was coming when B was bragging about her ring and said June was when they were looking, so I pulled G aside and flat out told him that I would not be at his wedding if it was the same day as my girlfriend's sister's, as they were in different states and I had told my girlfriend I would go already.

Sure enough, like a bad soap opera, B decides that the same weekend in June as my girlfriend's sister's wedding was a good choice, and plans her wedding then. G asked me to be a groomsman, and I said I couldn't unless he moved the date. 
B did invite my girlfriend to the bridal shower but not the wedding, which she declined.

G became a horrible roommate, he wasn't a good one to start, and stopped doing any chores. His dishes piled up. My other roommate, who is much nicer than me I guess, would often just do all his dishes and his chores. G stopped paying bills on time, citing the fact he had no money, but would spend $40+ on craft beer ever weekend. He stopped going out with us, and went with B exclusively.

I'll do some introspection and see if I can find stuff I did wrong. I never bought them a present or anything, and didn't even try to get access to their registry. I stopped responding to G when he'd ask me questions, and I would often just go lay on my bed if it was just me and G home. 

So, AITA for this? I went more because I don't like B than G, which is probably shallow of me."	Not the A-hole	0	0	361.0	116.0	0.0	0.0

c4dn19	2019-06-23 22:44:55		AITA for hooking up with two girls and WIBTA for exposing them to each other	"This is kinda a complicated situation but I’ll try to keep it brief. TLDR at the end

Let’s call the two girls A and B for simplicity. Last summer I got myself into a friend group of around 7 people. A and B were among the 7 and we all hungout quite often. Over time, it was clear that the two best friends, A and B, had a history of flirting with the same guy but never did anything....until me.

So things start off slow, A and B both seem interested but nothing has been confirmed as of yet. Meanwhile, two other guys in the group (say C and D), decide to start flirting with girl B. The whole group is engulfed in teenager horniness at this point (hope the satire doesn’t make me seem like the asshole already). Eventually, girl A and I begin talking more intimately, confiding our feelings for each other (I did like her and wasn’t just lying for a hookup). After this, during a hangout I see girl B seemingly flirting with guy C. Me being a teenager, I decide to overthink and believe that she no longer likes me anymore.

Prior to this, I hadn’t talked to girl B about anything intimate or hooking up. However, after that night I decided that A and me were over each other. After a few flirtatious texts, B and I hangout and stuff happens (not sex just some superficial making out). 

I may mention that A had told B that we talked and planned on hanging out before A began flirting with the other guys. 

About a week after B and I hookup, I get a text from girl A telling me that she was pissed I hooked up with A even though I told B I liked her. After many hours of apologetic texting, girl A tells me that B would be fine if we hooked up still (this was a lie and hurts me later). Apparently girl B didn’t want anything serious since we were leaving for college anyways, cool right? No.

So A and I end up hooking up after I was told it was ok. Was it ok? No. After a while, girl A decides to flirt with guy C again and I got pretty pissed and called her out in text. From this, girl A tells girl B that I talked shit about ye time we hooked up and that I said it was a “mistake”. 

From all this, I got kicked from the friend group because girl A lied to girl B and now the liar seems like the hero

Sorry for the long read, it was a highly developed scenario

TL;DR

Told a girl I liked her, saw her flirt with another guy so I hooked up with her friend (not in spite, actually liked her). Then hooked up with the girl I said I liked after she told me her friend was ok with it. Got kicked out of the friend group"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4dmw8	2019-06-23 22:44:42	compton_asshole	WIBTA if I don't take my white friend to the place I grew up?	"A little backstory:

I am a white male from Kosovo. We ran away from the war in 90s and pretty much sold everything for very little money. Long story short, we ended up in Compton, LA. I grew up being a part of the gang and still don't know how I wasn't killed or in jail. I did well in school and got a full ride to Berkley and currently, in the PhD program in Boston, MA.

&#x200B;

I have a colleague. He is a skinny white guy and overall, he is a cool dude. We were working on some projects and we became friends. Not the best friends but we still good friends. He was raised up in Richmond Hill in Canada and last summer, I went there to spend a weekend with his family.

&#x200B;

Now, this guy (let's call him Adam) loves rap music. He is a huge fan of Kendrick Lamar, Dr. Dre, Eminem etc. Occasionally, when he gets excited, he says something like: ""Damn, I owned this code, like Biggie owned 'Pac"" or ""This nigga got nothing on me"" (he was referring to a problem in the homework, that was particularly challenging). Also, he cannot drink. I mean he gets drunk after one beer and he starts acting like he is Creep or he is in a gang. It's awkward and in some weird way, funny.

&#x200B;

We are having a conference in Berkley in couple of weeks and I am planning to take couple of evenings to go see my friends in Compton. This came up during a lunch conversation and now, Adam is all excited and wants to come with me to see the ""hood"". Compton is not as bad as it used to be but nevertheless, it's not exactly the safest place on earth. I grew up in Compton and I would be with my friends and they are known on the streets, so I am not too stressed about myself. However, having Adam by our side adds a slight problem; I have told him once that he might get in troubles if he keeps acting like that but it didn't work. He might control himself in the beginning but as soon as he gets comfortable or drunk, that's a different story. Guys in Compton won't be really asking questions and having a long conversation about why it's not OK to say ""was good, my main nigga"". And if/when something goes down, there are very little things I will be able to do to help Adam.

&#x200B;

c4dmcm	2019-06-23 22:43:49	Thunderr_Daddy	AITA for telling her ex the truth?	"My recently changed to ex-best friend got angry at me for telling her now ex-boyfriend some of the things that she had done while she was in a relationship with him: sending nudes to male friends, selling nudes when she knew he was highly against it, literally cheating on him for the last three days of her dating him, and having sex with that new boyfriend during those last three days of the relationship. By the way, she's only 19, her ex is 18, and this new boyfriend is 32 and she had only known him for a bit over a week.

She didn't know I told him and I kept it from her for a while because I knew she'd be mad at me for it but I just felt that her ex had the right to know. He was very sad about the break up because they had a three-year relationship that became long distance for the 3rd year because his dad went off to Korea so he had to move in with his mom. She had also been emotionally manipulating him which I didn't know until after she and I ended our friendship which is why I'm really glad that I told him what happened. His sadness about the breakup became anger but it was better for him to not be depressed about a girl who obviously didn't care what she did to him. 

The way she emotionally manipulated him was because he was so sad about everything, while she was also in a relationship with this new guy a couple days after the breakup, she asked her ex to masturbate on the phone with her, and he told me he only did it because he thought that maybe there was a chance they could get back together. They had also talked about possibly getting back together in the future if they were both single next time he came back to visit, and I just didn't want him stuck on her when she obviously didn't care.

He and I hadn't been the best of friends the whole time that they were in a relationship. He and I pretty much hated each other for a year and eventually figured out how to just deal with each other, but now he has become kind of a friend of mine. 

She was pissed at me when she found out that I told him and told me that I took away her choice to tell him. I think it's pretty fucked up that she thinks she had to the right to keep that from him and continue to emotionally manipulate him. I think I did the right thing but she strongly thinks that I am a terrible best friend for telling him. I guess she and I have different standards, but what do you guys think?

c4diii	2019-06-23 22:37:44	throwaway738472	AITA for storming off from my friends because they started lunch without me?	"Recently, a friend of mine messaged me and a couple of other people on our Hangouts chat if we wanted to eat at a sushi restaurant for lunch. This place was somewhere in eastern Queens, NYC where the subways don't go (subways being our main method of transportation.) As a result, it was going to be a long, arduous trek getting there, taking both subways and buses. My friend who had recommended the idea said he was going to drive there.

Sometime around 1 pm that day, I called him and asked about how we were going to get there, and he told me he was already there, having driven another friend there as well, with another on the way there. I asked him why he didn't come by my place and pick me up as well since I was along the way, but he said he didn't remember my address and that I hadn't responded to his message on our Hangouts by the time he was leaving (I didn't notice his message until 40 minutes after he posted it), so he just went ahead anyway. He didn't really seem to be making much of an effort to get me, since he didn't try to call me in that time or get a hold of me directly in any way. I was upset at first, but I figured I shouldn't act so entitled and I got over it.

So I'm making my way there myself, riding on a train for at least 20 minutes, then I waited 10-15 minutes at a bus stop. During that time, I messaged my friends asking if they could come get me because the bus was taking too damn long to arrive and I had no idea when it would get there. No response for 10 minutes. By that point, I had gotten on a bus, and when they finally did respond, they said they were eating. I asked them if they had just started, which they didn't respond to.

By the time I had finally arrived, it had taken me at least an hour to get there. I finally found them, and they were all stuffing their faces and it looked like they were nearly done. My friend who invited me then asked, ""Do you want to eat here or do you want to eat somewhere else?"" The question was just baffling to me. It implied that they were ready to leave. I just responded with ""I'm going home. Fuck all you guys,"" and I left.

What really got me is that they didn't have any consideration for me. While they were driving there together without many problems, I was trudging along on slow public transportation. I was willing to overlook all that, but I just couldn't get over the fact that they would go ahead with their plans to start eating without me, without a care about how long it would take for me to get there. Granted, they were hungry, but I always thought it was really bad etiquette to begin eating before the entire party arrived, and for them to do that to me was just disrespectful. I've put up with some similar disrespect from them in the past, but this felt like a last straw to me. I ended up removing myself from our Hangouts and I haven't spoken to them since.

I'm just wondering now though, if I may have overreacted. Am I being unreasonable? Were they the assholes, or am I?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

I joined the team in October. Ever since, every single fucking meeting we are subjected to her almost 3 year old invading the meeting.  ""Blah blah business OH YAY KAYLEE PEED IN THE TOILET DO YOU HERE THAT???""  OR ""This years financials look good... No honey you can't have mm's for breakfast, here let me make you something"".

I have not had a 1:1 (scheduled or impromptu) without having to wait for her to talk to her daughter.

We (teammates and I) also often have to cover for her on meetings last minute because her kid is throwing a fit.

She is not a single mom.  Her husband was on disability in the home, now works part time but the in laws watch the daughter ""when they can"".  Which is never.  When he is home he won't watch her. Or he does sometimes, then we hear him screaming in the background.

Now... She is 8 1/2 months pregnant.  She goes on maternity leave soon.  Her boss has scheduled touchpoints with all of us.  And 3 of my colleagues have agreed this is #1 topic.

My fear is that she has already said that post maternity leave there is no plans for daycare because its ""too expensive"".  She'll ""figure it out"" between husband and in laws.  Husband is a douche who won't help.  How can we do our jobs with 2 of her kids crying/screaming.

""Dude, is this a karma post? Obviously not the asshole"".

The flip side:
She saved me.  I was about to be fired due to my own personal reasons (tldr alcoholic wife i kicked out eventually).  She told her boss she wanted me, and I have been killing it in a good way. I make more money (salary before, hourly now).

She is great at her job otherwise, and supports us in our decisions. Even when I stick my neck out, she is there to support (all of us on the team).  

So i feel like i am betraying her.

The first couples times I thought it was thoughtful but now it’s just getting annoying. 
My daughter has plenty of clothes and toys but maybe once a month there is a bag of ripped, stained clothes and broken baby junk. I’ve tried politely telling her (several times) that we just don’t have space or need but she says “it’s no problem and just to donate anything I don’t want.” Today I found another bag so I just brought it back over and left it on her porch. My fiancé says I’m being an asshole and I should just do what she says and donate anything I don’t want but I’m busy, why is finding/ driving to a place to donate her old things my job?"

c4dg9u	2019-06-23 22:34:02		WIBTA if I made up an excuse to skip my friend's wedding?	"So... I'm \[22F\] invited to a friend's \[22F\] wedding this saturday. The fact that it's this weekend and that I've been invited for like 6 months is making me think that I'll be the asshole but I still really want to hear what you guys think...

So, it's 5 hours away, and there's a heat wave in my country this weekend, we're talking 39°c (102°f). So that's 10 hours in total in a car during the hottest heat wave we've had in years. I did know it was far, didn't realise it was that far, and that's my fault; but I only heard about the heat wave a few days ago, and I'm really anxious about that because I get sick in the car very often, especially when it's hot, so I don't know how I'll be able to handle a drive that long.

The plan is to leave with another friend who is invited too (I can't drive), and she wants to leave the day before at around 4pm, spend the friday+sunday night(after the wedding) at her aunt's place, and come back on sunday after lunch. But I haven't seen her since high school, and we never were very close, so I'm anxious about the fact that I'll be spending the weekend with her+her aunt (basically in a region/house I don't know with people I don't know) as well as 10 hours with her in a car...

There's also the fact that my little sister has a dance performance on sunday (the big thing she's been practicing a year for), and she's been crying a few times about the fact that I won't be there - I was working abroad for the past 6 months and only came back a week ago, and she only told me it was that week when I came back.

But yeah. I know that if I don't go to the wedding, my friend will get very mad and probably refuse to speak to me ever again (she got in a fight with her best friend a few months ago for something that would seem very unimportant to most people, insists she'll never speak to her again, and acts like she's the worst person that she's ever met). I'd hate to lose her, we're not the closest of friends but we've known each other since high school."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

But when we game things just take an U-turn. He prefers playing MOBA’s and games where team cooperation is key so that makes the situation just so much worse.


He recently came out and told me he had been diagnosed with aspergers a few years back. So some of his personality traits make perfect sense but i feel that he blows out of proportion the grasp the disorder has on his character and that most of his toxicity has nothing to do with his disorder and is his own personal doing. 


He never listens, this is an obvious one. He talks all day but completely ignores you when it’s your turn to speak. He flat out ignores you and doesn’t respond unless what you said isn’t a direct response to what he earlier said. 


I try to help him get better at the game, i really do. I tell him to do this and that differently, he doesn’t respond or listen to anything you say and do the same mistakes 10 minutes later. 


He is extremely toxic and puts blame on everything and anything around him, completely blind to his own mistakes. He verbally assaults people whose playstyle isn’t perfect while his own is severely flawed. He gets verbally violent with me whenever i try to point out his mistakes and that he is the issue in our games. He wants me to take his side regardless of how hard he fucks up and i just can’t. 


Now when i know his disorder and that he is physically unable of bettering himself i either ignore him or make excuses for when he hits me up wanting to game together. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c4ddcd	2019-06-23 22:29:23	3cheers4throwaway	AITA for telling my cousin her to dump her boyfriend and that she shouldn’t date for a while?	"This is a throw away account and quite long so bare with me.  

Me (17f) and my Cousin (18f) are super close and almost like sisters, we’re around each-other 24/7 and tell eachother everything. An important thing to know about my cousin is she falls in love quite easily and sticks with that person through thick and thin. This isn’t a problem, it’s endearing really but the people she falls for are... terrible. 

Recently she’s gotten with this boy, I’ll call him Javi (18m) who’s never been the greatest person.  He’s continuously cruel to my cousin, especially before  they started dating. He had an entire group chat where he’d post her face and make fun of her appearance, mannerisms, ect. He demeans her opinions and is quite misogynistic toward her and other women. All in all he isn’t the best person. 

My cousin is a big girl, but she’s verily emotional. She thinks he can fix him, thinks he’s very sweet at the core, and thinks him going through a hard time is any excuse for his behavior (though this doesn’t account for past actions). I’ve kept my mouth shut for peace, I don’t want to seek nagging, but my final stress was her birthday dinner. 

She’s not super big on birthdays, but considering this was the big one eight we decided to take her out to eat, mostly our family, some friends, and Javi. Things were going fine, and everyone was having a good time. Javi then started talking about my cousins body in a less than appropriate way as “bragging rights” to his and her friends. My cousin, who’s VERY sensitive about discussion to her body started looking uncomfortable so I called him out. We got into a big fight, he called me a b*tch and called me controlling  and I called him a self entitled jackass among other things.  My cousin tried to calm us down, but Javi and I were to deep into it. The night ended with Javi leaving with some friends and me telling me my cousin should dump him. 

I thought this was.. innocent. He wasn’t a nice man and she could certainly do better, but no one else took it this way. I was contacted by about ten family members, 3 of their friends and Javis MOTHER about how inappropriate   it was for me to meddle in my cousins business, and how awful I was to embarrass Javi in such a public scene.  

My cousin, who was more upset than she showed me the day before, refuses to message me and I’m still getting texts about my behavior. Should I stand my ground or apologize to Javi? 

Edit: in our talk  I did tell my cousin she should be weary about dating again."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Also I currently live my parents, two younger brothers and four dogs.

On Friday night I came home from work excited to break into my new gin and have a relaxing night, to find the gin, along with a couple of ciders, a couple of bottles of lemonade and a vegge takeaway pizza my boyfriend had ordered and left for me all gone from my room. I pulled apart my whole room looking for it but it was legit nowhere.
I ask my boyfriend if he had moved it, but he says he hadn't, plus he doesn't drink so it doesn't sound likely he nicked it. 
The only other people in the house Friday were my two wee brothers. The youngest doesn't drink and is one of those people that heavy judges people for drinking, and also doesn't eat vegetables so it's very unlikely it was him. 
However the older of the two, 17, drinks as much as he can get a hold of, and will eat anything. Just so happened that when I got home from work he was out and when he got back home he was clearly drunk.
And it couldn't have been some rando walking in to the house and just taking shit because my laptop was sitting in the desk and also someone would have noticed the dogs going mental.
He's been adamantly denying taking anything from my room and keeps saying ""I wouldn't lie to sodastreammmmmmmmmmm"" etc. 
http://imgur.com/a/MvOUPcW

My parents are in the mindset of well he won't admit to it may as well let it go, which I think is wildly irresponsible, but they've always babied my wee brothers. They think I'm overreacting and that I have no place to tell them how to do their jobs as parents and I'm being an asshole by trying to do so. And also there is the chance he didn't do it, but I'm convinced he did.

AITA for wanting my parents to punish my younger brother for stealing stuff from my room even though the refuses that he did it and all the evidence I have is circumstantial?

Edit: feel I should add he's done things like this in the past where there has been proof. Like when he took a bottle of vodka from my room and I found the bottle in his a few days later.

"Me and my wife will have been married 15 years in a couple of weeks and we've booked a long weekend away in a hotel on the other side of the country. We have 2 daughters (13 and 10) and a son (9). Originally they were going to stay with my SIL but things have happened which made the arrangement inconvenient. My wife suggested that we ask my mother to have the kids - she lives relatively close and has a big old house all to herself - but I refuse to leave my kids alone with her. 

Long story short, I am the eldest of 3 brothers and we all have strained relationships with Mum because of how she behaved while we were growing up. She went through phases of being friendly and normal but then switched to being highly critical and irritable with little notice, which then caused her to shout and be verbally abusive. It wore off when we all got teenage-ish years, but the instability has had effects on us. I'm not so worried about my eldest, but I am about the younger two because they are very sensitive and wouldn't be able to deal with this. 

In my defence (if you can call it that), I would allow it if my dad was still alive because he was good at diffusing situations, but without anyone to do that I am worried that without someone to mediate any arguments that familial relationships would be ruined.

She's the easiest solution and I know she would be willing to do it but that still doesn't soothe me. 

AITA for basing this decision on her behaviour 20-odd years ago?

EDIT: Thought I should mention that my wife thinks the kids will be fine but I'm still not convinced.

EDIT 2: Put in a comment but thought it would be beneficial here:

This sounds terrible but we don't see her often, once every few months or so, because I try and avoid regular visits. She's fine with them but they aren't left alone with her and I think she also tries to overcompensate for not seeing them. We only ever go for day visits so we aren't really there long enough to see if the behaviour is still there."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"TL;DR: best friend & coworker got mad that I didn't tell her that I was staying with the company before everyone else knew, and never told me about it until a month later, after i realized she had shunned me. She's very pissed off - is her claim good, or is she being manipulative?

&#x200B;

Hi All,

&#x200B;

I really need some advice... Im a F26 and had this girl who I considered my best friend F27. We both live in the US, and we're both originally from the same city in a different country. We also have the same profession.

&#x200B;

About a year ago, she lost her job, and I referred her to get a job at my company. She then started working there and we became best friends. I had a Junior position, and as she was more experienced than me, I referred her for a Staff position, above mine (I say this bc I could have tried applying for the higher position instead of referring her). Everything was great until a few months ago I invited her to come to my birthday and she had other plans. Ok, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and forgot about it and moved on.

&#x200B;

Then, about 2 months ago I got offered another job. I told her at the same time I told people at my office, because she had already given me clues that she can be a big greedy and I'm not too sure if she was going to harm me if I had told her before i give my notice to my boss. I'm a very discreet person and dont like to share news with others until things are set in stone.

&#x200B;

On my last week at the job, the company reached out to me to make me stay, offering me a promotion to a different department, making more money. Now, I'd be making as much as she makes. Then they dragged me along and only gave me an offer letter over the weekend, after I had already packed all my bags and left. Before I left that Friday, I spoke to two of my bosses and they kind of convinced me to stay. Still, I only got a finalized cover letter over the weekend, and made a decision to stay. That weekend was hers and my bf's brother's graduation parties, in different states.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, I got into the office and everybody was shocked that I was there. I was planning on surprising her with a jump like wooaaah Im still here surprise!!!. But then they came up with this newsletter that broke the news before I told her. She sent me a text with a screenshot of the newsletter and a question mark. I replied back with a meme saying SURPRISE!!! And she just sent me a cold answer like ""ok then your farewell lunch on Friday was fake"". I said that it wasn't, and it had all happened over the weekend. She never replied to that. I called her extension that day and talked to her briefly about her graduation party and asking if it was fun, she sounded very bitter about me not being there and said ""it's a once in a lifetime thing... you missed out"". I said sorry I couldnt go."	Not the A-hole	0	0	106.0	59.0	0.0	0.0

c4d10d	2019-06-23 22:09:39	somethinglikechaos	AITA for “cyberstalking” a stranger before meeting up with him?	"This needs a little backstory. 

I’m interested to hear outside perspectives on this matter. I can understand his view of things, but also my reasons in the first place. 

I’m (20F) on a trip in an eastern European country right now and made a post on Reddit to find people to do stuff with in the city that I’m in right now. An American expat (late 30sM, so considerably older) responded to my post, we chatted and got along so we scheduled to have dinner the next day. 

On that day he kept pushing the time back more and more (apparently being held up with work, okay that’s fine), but we exchanged numbers for easier communication. He texted me and his full name showed up on the text, so I decided to google him. Just firstname lastname, and a lot of stuff showed up on the first page. Pictures, employment history, his birthday, where he lived, all that. I just skimmed through to see if he is who he’s saying he is. I’m a young woman alone in an eastern country meeting up with a stranger from Reddit, I wanted to calm my nerves. 

We meet up, have dinner, a nice chat. Somehow the topic transitioned to technology etc, and I admit that I looked him up before meeting. He was very upset, which I can sort of understand. He texted me after, saying how shaken up he is and how I violated his privacy by googling him beforehand, and he specifically called it “cyber stalking”. All information I saw was 100% public on google. 

I apologised to him and said that I’ll definitely learn from this, which I will. In my age group it’s kind of normal to do a quick google search on someone before meeting a stranger, but maybe I should question this behaviour.

I told her the first time I didn't appreciate her showing up drunk. She did it again today. When I was leaving she was begging for me to take her home with me and I said no. She started crying and being very pouty... which made me feel bad honestly but I was very much annoyed.

She doesn't seem to think this is a big deal... AITA?

c4cxzq	2019-06-23 22:04:48	300scj	AITA for telling our conservative parents that we’re preventing pregnancy?	"Throwaway account because people from our town would know who we are.

My wife and I were both brought up in very conservative christian homes. We’ve known each other since early childhood and were married three years ago at 19. We’re both christians but neither of us are anywhere near as conservative as our parents and don’t plan to lead the same type of lives as they have. Our marriage is great, we love each other a great deal and always talk about how we feel.

Anyway: We told everyone that we weren’t going to prevent pregnancies when we were married but as my wife had just started college and neither of us felt ready to start a family, my wife had an IUD. Up until today, we’ve told everyone that we’re trying but that God just hasn’t given us a baby yet. Obviously there (most likely) isn’t anything wrong with either of our reproductive parts so we’ve been very chill about our “infertility” but our families have started to worry a lot. I haven’t felt great about lying as I do believe it’s a sin but my wife has been adamant about not telling anyone so I’ve respected that.

My wife has been doing amazingly in college and was accepted as a transfer student at a big university out of state a few months ago. We’re moving up there in august and planned to tell our families about our move today at church.

When we told them, our families were pretty sceptical but seemed accepting of our decision to move. But afterwards, my mom cornered us and outright asked us if we were using birth control and I just couldn’t lie so I told her yes. She immediately started crying and told my dad and my wife’s parents as well who also got visibly upset. As we drove home my wife was livid and said that I’d betrayed her trust. I don’t think that’s fair - I know she’s the one with the IUD but I see it as just as much MY secret as hers and lying to your loved ones just isn’t right in my opinion.

Our pastor just called me and said he’d come by in two hours. My wife i saying that she’s ready to pack her bags and leave town for good which I think is much too excessive. We both know that we aren’t coming back to our town after we move in august as the pressure of living how our parents want us to is 
to much for us, but I don’t want to estrange my whole family in the process.

AITA?

Edit: guys, please be respectful about my family and their beliefs. Yeah, they’re much more conservative than we are but maybe don’t call me/my family lunatics/crazy people. Thanks.


UPDATE:

Thank you for all of your replies. I fully realize that I am the a-hole and that I shouldn’t have shared this information with anyone. However, I wouldn’t say I chose my mom over my wife as many of you are saying. Me telling my mom about the birth control was in panic rather than an active choice. I would always prioritize my relationship with my wife over anything as SHE’S the one I want to spend my life with, not my parents. I certainly screwed up though, I’m aware that my actions haven’t reflected my intentions.

Some more info: out of all my siblings, I have two brothers that are no longer on speaking terms with my parents due to leaving our religion, although I keep in contact with one of them. The other one chose to cut ties with all of us except for one of my sisters about 10 years ago and I only very occasionally hear about how he’s doing (according to my sister, he’s doing ok and got married a few years ago) but my other brother has been struggling immensely. That’s definitely why I’ve been so willing to give into my family’s expectations even though I disagree with so many of their beliefs.

My wife and I had a really long conversation after getting home last night, the content of which I’ll try to boil down:

I started off by apologizing for this major screwup. She then said a lot of what y’all have already said, that I need put first her first no matter what, that she’ll be the one who’s blamed for us not having kids even though we both made the decision etc.

In the end, she said that she forgives me which was the world’s biggest relief. However, she also said that she does not ever want to set foot in our church again. This hurt me a lot, but I also know that leaving the church will ultimately be for the best as the only way we could ever be accepted again would be to change our beliefs according to those of our parents.

I have a job starting August lined up in the town we’re moving to but my wife and I have agreed that we’ll both look into opportunities to find work up there immediately so we can push our move as much forward as possible. Shouldn’t be too big of a challenge for me as I work in a field with close to no unemployment.

All in all it looks like we’re leaving our community asap which is scary but hopefully going to be good for us.

UPDATE #2:

Our pastor didn’t come by last night. I called him up and told him we’d be leaving for a while to get some food and talk things over and while he initially said that he thought we could benefit from his spiritual guidance, he did back off after I declined.

He called me up about a half our ago and said he’d come over when I was home from work but I once again declined. My wife is currently at home packing our stuff so we don’t really want our pastor at our house right now. That’d probably mean that people from church would show up at our doorstep within the hour.

As for our parents, my mom sent me a really long text earlier talking about sin and how she didn’t want me ending up like the two of my brothers who abandoned our religion. Haven’t replied to that yet."	Asshole	0	0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4cxta	2019-06-23 22:04:33		AITA for my TV being unintentionally too loud?	"Background info: I am deaf and wear a cochlear implant. I've lived in the same Condo for the past 5 years. It is my first home, first time living on my own and first time in an apartment complex. Since I own it outright, I take care of my building so it looks its best, along with helping close neighbors. EX: got a pressure washer, and will do all surrounding sidewalks, breezeways, other front doors, patios, etc. I am well liked and respected.

&#x200B;

6 months ago, I bought my first giant TV. My friend loaned me an entire sound system to go with it. That system helped me tremendously with sound and speech cognition, since I can hear things I wouldn't hear on a regular basis. It made a tremendous difference in my day to day life, since I had more experience with a wide band of sound, and could more easily distinguish sound and speech. It's incredible. I started upgrading the sound system to deliver a better range of sound and frequencies. 

&#x200B;

I always extended the olive branch to my neighbors, and said let me know if its loud. I quickly learned my limits for an appropriate sound level. My main concern was my downstairs neighbor, who is most affected. I spoke with them on a semi-regular basis, so I'm not going out of bounds. A few months ago, when I was testing out a new receiver, they hit the ceiling when a truck blew up in Mad Max. I immediately turned it down, spoke with the boyfriend and his gf the next day, apologized, and said hit the ceiling again if there's a problem. It was all smiles and laughs. It was the only time they hit the ceiling.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. One night I was up late, till about 2am. The whole time, I was playing at a volume level that we agreed was not disturbing. It was the only time I was up that late. Suddenly, there is a loud banging on the wall & front door. The girl downstairs came up with a baseball bat, and was beating my front door and wall. It was shocking, especially since her smiling bf greeted me a couple days prior. Thought all was good. I turned the system way down, and quietly resumed. She comes back again, and continues to damage my front door. I confronted her, asked if it was too loud, apologized, and she responded with ""Next time, it will be your glass"". I was in disbelief. She was acting so crazy. I would have listened. FYI, they rent, and I own. Idk why they didn't hit the ceiling. 

&#x200B;

I filed a police report. It's pretty open and shut. Since them, I've shunned them. I understand now, that yes, it was late at night and I shouldn't have been doing anything at all. It wasn't something I understood before, but it was a ONE TIME OCCURRENCE. I would have stopped. HOA is on my side.

&#x200B;

So, since I'm a deaf person learning sound, have always been friendly, want everyone to be happy, AITA here? I don't think so. It's a complete overreaction and ridiculous. Frankly, if I could hear like a normal person, I would have paid for it. But I can't, these are the cards I'm dealt, and I have to learn the best I can."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4cw74	2019-06-23 22:01:58		AITA for arguing with my girlfriend because she’s awful a texting?	"Amazing girl. Love her soooo much. Seriously. Great in person. The worst texter literally ever. I have trust issues, let’s get that out there. Father left when I was young, last gf cheated on me. I’ve disclosed this with my girlfriend and she tells me she’ll be there for me. Great. However, when we text she is 1) never interested 2) awful at responding and 3) sometimes downright lies and will be on Instagram instead of talking to me. 
Every time I tell her how I feel about this, its the same argument. I tell her how it makes me feel like other things (Instagram/snapchat) are more important/ worth her time than I am when she doesn’t answer. I know this isn’t true, but this is how I feel. I understand that that’s me being insecure, but after talking about it and agreeing to work through it, she’s back to being awful at texting the very next day. I don’t get it. I see no effort being put in, but she always has an excuse for it. 
The example that finally made me make this post - mid conversation she stops answering. I know that she isn’t doing anything ( literally sitting on a delayed train) so after ~10 mins I text her wyd. 
Literally the night after she said she’ll work on it, she tells me she’s on Reddit reading a story. What? I’m currently on vacay and I got out of the water to come talk to her and mid convo she just stops answering. I literally answered in 15 seconds btw

c4ctqp	2019-06-23 21:58:06	throwmeaways01928374	AITA for being pissed that my daughter has changed her mind on a season ticket after I've bought it, no refunds, without so much as a second thought?	"This is a long one so TL;DR at the bottom.

So a little backstory, my ex decided she didn't want to make things work approx 9 years ago, took my daughter with her, I've had her every weekend and Tues and Thurs evenings ever since. 

We were massively in debt, nearly 5 figures, all in my name due to her previous financial problems. Obviously there were rows about this that lead to her going. 

On her suggestion I stayed at the house and don't pay child support, but I have her as often as possible and buy clothes, shoes, pay for clubs, anything she needs and the cost of entertaining her every weekend.

I'm still paying off debt from when we were a family, I don't have a social life, I live on my own, I haven't been able to get out and meet anyone else or commit to anyone I've met online. All I can afford is to get up, go to work, pay off debts and see her when I can.

As my daughter has grown up she's taken an interest in sports, to the point where we bought a season ticket for our local club. We've gone for the last 6 seasons, I've either scrimped or taken  out a low interest credit card to pay for them, in all honesty I don't have the money but it's what she wants to do.

She is now more active socially and is now playing the sport she loves. However she may or may not get into the team she's trialling for. When I first heard of this a few months ago I asked if I should still buy a season ticket for us. The ex said go ahead as the team may be folding. I've had 5 or 6 texts repeatedly assuring me I should buy as it's unlikely she'll get in the team.

I've purchased, started paying before the season starts, tickets were around $700, the team has folded so no worries. Except now there's a chance for her to join another team. So now she may not make the games I've paid for. So rather than the ex stick to the original plan she's found her another team knowing I'd paid out.

This kinda hurt that it was just dropped so quickly  but also she's done this before. I've flipped and now my ex is telling me I shouldn't be getting in the way of what my daughter wants to do, things change, maybe if I can find that money I can pay child support and generally that I'm being silly about it.

So......TL;DR.......AITA for possibly being selfish and wanting to still carry on going with my daughter, or am I NTA because they were both given plenty of opportunities to bail on the season tickets and I was told to still buy them with money I don't have but was spending to try and keep my daughter happy?"

c4ct0i	2019-06-23 21:57:01	downloadedahouse	AITA for ghosting a guy I dated	"TLDR below. I'll start with how we met. So he saw me shopping in a supermarket. He complimented my dress. Long story short, we ended up chatting for 10 mins and I agreed to meet him at a cafe tomorrow. Number exchanged. 


We were openly casual, non was up for a relationship. The first date went beautifully. The second one followed two days after, last Thursday. He initiated sex but it was already late for me. Had he started earlier, I would have gone with it. We agreed we would do it next time. 


When we were in his place, he asked if I would be free on Saturday (22 June). I said yes. Then some time after that, he asked again if I had a plan on Saturday. I said not yet. He said ok let's meet then. 


On Saturday, I waited for his text about the time. It was afternoon already but I was ok with it. Because it was an important holiday in this country on Friday, everybody drank. I thought he probably woke up late. I got ready. Last text between us at that point was from me on Friday evening, he read but didn't reply. Then 3 pm on Saturday, he texted. Saying ""I think tomorrow I can see you. Did you have a great day?""


I was furious. He replied that late in the day, didn't apologize that we wouldn't meet. Then replaned tentatively and acted like nothing was wrong. So I didn't reply back. Today he texted asking if everything was ok. I don't have that kind of energy to explain what went wrong. I'm not blocking him, just gonna leave it like that. Am I an asshole?

However, my little brother is kind of 'obsessed' with me (in a cute toddler way). The thing is, I really don't like it or want to. Many times I just wanna say 'no I don't want to play' or other such things, but then my stepmum would get annoyed. When I get home from school for example, I want to go to my room and lie down for a bit, maybe watch YouTube or something. But I get home, have a snack, and then as soon as I'm about to go upstairs my little brother says 'no stay, don't go' and then I stay with him for another half hour. A-its really boring 'hanging out' with him because he just wants to play kiddy games (as he would), and B-the only real time I have for myself is a few hours at night before I go to bed. Feedback is helpful thanks

Edit: to be more clear, the 30 minutes is not generally how much time I spend, it's a general estimate of how much more time I spend when I'm about to leave and do my own thing-which I find more annoying when I get home from school and am tired etc. On the weekends it's generally for hours on end"	No A-holes here	0	0	210.0	51.0	0.0	0.0

I feel like just emptying the cupboard and saying “See this? THIS is OK” 

I don’t want to be an asshole and embarrass her, but I don’t want her to feel guilty and like she’s failing on her mission of losing a few pounds either.

c4cned	2019-06-23 21:48:06	MrBaddeley	AITA for not staying quiet	"As a younger person You often get told a numerous amount of times to stay quiet when being somewhat ‘told off’ however in some occasions when I know I’m right I’ll make sure they know that I’m not wrong.

The setting is a DofE (Duke of Edinburgh Award)  expedition. I’ve been walking for at least 6-8 hours at this point and have almost come to the final checkpoint. Our tour guide who this altercation occurred with gave us a help in hand and told my group that the next footbridge on your right will take you to the final destination. I heard this, my group heard this, I’m sure people walking by heard this. The tour guide then carries on ahead and leaves us to continue on our own.

.... After around 5minutes of walking  we come to a bridge, not a footbridge, but a standard bridge which is completely different. We have a little debate whether or not we take this path but decide the best thing to do would be to follow the tour guides ‘help’ and wait till we come across a footbridge. We were not the best group at map reading so we were not 100% certain at that point wether or not if we crossed that bridge we would have ended up in the right place . We walk and walk.... and walk until we actually see our camp on the other side of a shallow slow moving stream of water clearly meaning we had missed our turning. That would have been the bridge we came across, which was now at least a 30 minute walk in the other direction.

This is where myself and another member of our group decided to hop a fence and cross the lake which inevitably lead to the tour guide having a go at us and persisted he told us to take the bride, I argued and stated that he said a footbridge and not a normal bridge, this went on for a good 10 minutes until we was told to go back across the lake even though we had already crossed but persisted we go back and take the bridge. He mentioned that crossing the lake was a health and safety risk but made us cross it again to get back which didn’t make sense (I also argued about this)

We cross the lake and take the 30 minute walk back on ourselves, cross the bridge and walk 30 minutes to the camp. Tensions are high at this point, we’ve been walking all day and are not in the best of moods. Our teacher who took us on the expedition then has a talk with our group once we are back at the camp and took the tour guides side completely and said if I was not to apologise and admit my mistake I would be removed from the expedition. 

I knew I wasn’t wrong and would not apologise for his mistake so long story short I was put onto the coach and removed from the expedition, however because I was removed from the group this meant my whole group failed.

Am I the asshole for not staying quite and due to not staying quiet ended up getting the rest of my group removed from the expedition?

EDIT: I’d like to mention the group I was with are my very close friends and did take my side on this, whether that makes me more or less of an asshole I’m not sure. But I feel as though they understood. I’m sure they would have preferred to stay and complete the expedition. We had a laugh about the situation after a while, but I do feel bad for ruining their expedition."	Asshole	0	0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

Okay, I'm an 18M and I work at Batteries Plus Bulbs. I really enjoyed working here when I started and had a lot of fun. It's my first real paying job (Volunteering and such before that) and it's been enjoyable. I enjoy working with two co-workers in particular and felt like I had real friends with them. However, one of them left. 

After that coworker left my other friend that worked there and I felt like everything got worse. We've had a lot more work put on us, and we have to step up to work. That's fine, I have no issue with it. However, recently management hired a new guy (We'll call him Bob), Bob has been here for a little over a month and is a complete pain to work with. He breaks everything he touches and is slow with customers. One top of that the owner isn't much better. My friend and I have to do a lot of work if not almost all of it. It's not enjoyable anymore and I dread having to work with Bob or the Owner. 

This brings me to the WIBTA part. I told the owner that I would stay till at least August (when I thought I'd be shipping to boot camp, turns out that's December now). Since I don't leave till December I applied for a job at my old school. I meant to work this job as a second one (I'm part time at Batteries Plus) but now I may want to make it full time if I can. 

Basically would I be an asshole if I left my current job for a new one?

"A few months ago my aunt came by my parents apartment for a couple days before they left for Florida. During their time there I was going through a rough stretch where my loans got declined because my parents filed bankruptcy a few years prior.

Anyways this was leading to me having a ultimatum my mom and her family were heavily involved in the military and she told me I would have to join that to get my college paid for. My dad (aunt's relative) was in the military and is very against me joining as I am. 

We start talking and she goes ""You need to join the military like your cousin steven, He's doing great!"" He was a naval officer and went to the academy but no longer talks to his mom anymore because he resented being forced to join. She then goes on to say, ""SeaMoose22 this is the ONLY way to go, the military is the best way to go."" 

I replied, ""I really do not feel like joining the military I will work here and save my money to go to college"" 

She's retorts, ""What job are you even gonna get that'll save you enough for a year in college especially since you don't have a job now."" 

I was already irritated that she was talking about what I should do so I replied, ""I feel it is in my best interest not to join the military so I am going to to do what I think is best. I've never talked to you in my life so why do you feel you know what's best for me?"" 

My Aunts face got red and goes, ""You should not speak to me that way, you are a loser and I'll be surprised if you ever get out of this apartment."" 

I was so angry at this point I told her, ""How about you get the fuck out of my business, and not speak to me like I'm a complete moron."" 

She ran out of the apartment then called my dad later telling him I should apologize and learn how to talk to my elders. My dad was okay with it and said he was looking forward to talking to his sister but she was just what she was when they stopped talking.

Flash forward to now I am happily in school and living on my own after I got my credit score up and got my own loans. She is coming back to my parents where I am staying for the summer. My mom told me I should apologize but I told her fuck no because I feel I need an apology for her invading my business. AITA?

I dont wave my opinion around and express only when aksed - that i find religion as a consept rediculous. I have no problem with it excisting because of people truly wanting to use it. 

&#x200B;

Human beings friendships are build on how we act towards eachother and the effort in nursing the ones you love. Why not be 100% real and understanding. Some people try to polish their ""story"" about them self, ""delete"" all the bad sentences and sell that to the world. 

&#x200B;

A current story:

&#x200B;

My friend is being married and have invited me to the church ceremony, food afterwards and the party later in the evening. 

I totally respect their choice to be wed as christians and that they want to make a ceremony out of it, i just dont want to be apart of it. 

I will help them the days leading up to the big day and on the day.  I will create the best damn gift they will ever recieve. 

I will spent time on the two persons, just not the religion.

My reasoning is just like i feel about vegans, im not a vegan my self, but if you are, i hope you are the best damn vegan in the world and hope you enjoy it. And i have the view on these subjects as: \[insert belief\] is just like a penis, it's totally fine to have one, i just dont want it shoved in my face. 

As i personally don't think religion is healthy or a force for good, i don't want to support it. I dont want to have anything to do with it. No hate for the people.

&#x200B;

I said this to my parents and that i would back out from any religious thing from now on. They got mad (more than i thought, and they are not activly religious), and said that why i don't just sit in church, sing the songs, and just be an adult about it. 

Yes i have sat in church many times before and i can surely do it again that is not the point. If i don't believe in anyway in the belief and the ceremony, why should i attend? Is the whole thing about religion is'nt that it's a space for equal believers to meet and share an important spiritual moment? 

Would religious people even want me there if they knew my thoughts on the subject?

&#x200B;

I think it's like eating your friends cooked dinner, eating everything except the glazed mushrooms, because of taste and still end up as the bad guy. Why should i get forced to eat them by social constructed views if i simply dont like them? I stop buying mushrooms because i dont like them, but that has nothing to do with my relationship with a mushroom eater.

&#x200B;

And yes i tell the people its about my thoughts and most of the time they dont care and say that it is just a ceremony. My problem is with the people that really think that i really have to and its very important. 

&#x200B;

Sry for the weird comparrisons, i just wanted to try and share my reasoning.

She met a guy. I like him, I like them, but it is very intense. He would be at ours 3/7 nights p/w. He has his own flat, but it's further from the city centre. I have this apartment because of family, and because of that she only pays about 1/3 of what people would pay for a double room where we are.

It was solidly about 5/7 nights per week for the first month. The day I was to go back to my hometown for Christmas, I'm packing and I get a message from her: 'Hey, I left X in my room, he was too tired to leave, let him out when you're going home to Xtown!' (A) is it that hard for him to get up when she gets up (b) he's not my boyfriend, I shouldn't have to wake him up and (c) I thought I was home alone for that time. I agreed to let him out, but ended up leaving fifteen minutes later than I'd planned because it took him that long (even tho I gave him a 30 min warning). I tell her that I don't like having to do that, and made it clear I didn't want to be responsible for him.

I decide a good ground rule is 3/7 nights p/w. I chose to live with one flatmate, not two, and the flat is small. I figured three nights p/w was good cos it's less than half the time, but still ok. She agrees and apologises if he's been over too much, and I assure her that she shouldn't feel bad, the 3/7 rule means we have a solid boundary. 

The following week, he stays three nights. The week after, it's back to five nights. I remind her, she apologises, says that she forgot. She is ditsy at times so I believe that she forgot, but the reason why I made the rule was so I wouldn't have to ask for space.

AGAIN, she leaves him at home when she goes to work, doesn't tell me for hours. I feel stressed cos I'd gone around the apartment thinking I was alone, ie. singing, naked, etc. I ask her not to do it again.

It comes to a head the following week, when instead of a girl's night we'd agreed on, they sleep from 4pm onwards. I go out without her, and she's upset that I didn't wake her and tell her that he should leave. 

The next day, I ask her to be more considerate. I told her I don't want to be responsible for him if he sleeps in, and I'd prefer if he left when she leaves. I told her I needed her to stick to the three nights a week so she doesn't have to ask me if it's OK for him to come over cos it's a boundary we've agreed on. 

This week she left him in the flat alone again. Also, it's his fourth night this week. I feel like she has crossed this boundary a lot, I don't feel respected. I'm frustrated she can forget something that I've made clear. 

I feel like a warden, but I want to be relaxed at home. WIBTA to approach her about this? If I WITBA how should I approach this?"	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4ciu4	2019-06-23 21:41:00	yuGnaitpygE	WIBTA if I ask my friend to cut the crap?	"Hey there, so I have a friend who has been my friend for many years now, he has a very bad habit of fabricating lies, and you can easily tell they're lies, I usually avoid telling him ""cut the crap"" not to hurt his feelings but recently it's been too much to ignore and I have to fake believing it all the time to not hurt his feelings. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes he says ""hey man I'm at the immigration department to prepare my visa to work in italy"" (we live in a poor middle eastern country and everyone here knows how hard it is for someone without a good amount of money and/or good education to immigrate to almost any rich country), sometimes he says stuff like ""so today at work, there was this theft and I pulled the perfect plan to catch the thief by secretly filming until the camera caught the theif"".

&#x200B;

Today for example he told me ""I'm going to x city for 4 days (an expensive city)"" and when I asked if he knows someone who would host him (since I know he's broke af) he told me that one of his father's friends works in a hotel there, so I asked ""so just because your father's friend works in the hotel, the hotel will accommodate you for free?"" he got annoyed at my question and switched topics.

&#x200B;

this is something that happens whenever we meet or talk online, and I know he's doing it because he has some issues with how he views himself and how he seeks overcompensation by presenting himself as an ""interesting person"" and that's why I avoid hurting his feelings, but lately I feel like just telling him ""you're lying man and it's too obvious"" so WIBTA?"

c4ciu3	2019-06-23 21:41:00		AITA for trying to attend my friend's wedding without my wife?	"My wife and I haven't been to a wedding together since our own wedding. A slight friend from college is getting married soon and my wife and I were invited (while we were engaged) even though we weren't super close with them. My wife doesn't like them very much but we still were considering going. Their save the date said ""caramelcooler and *Guest*"" - as if they didn't know I was with her or something. Then the invite spelled her name wrong. She was very bitter about this and decided she 100% was not going, but told me I could go by myself. Then she took a shift at work the day of, so now she definitely can't go. I RSVP'd yes for myself and marked her as a no.

I was really excited to go back and see a lot of friends I haven't seen since college. I started making plans to drive there with a friend who's also going. I told my wife I'd carpool with him to save gas $, and she got extremely upset, saying things like ""I don't know a single person who would go to a wedding without their wife"" and ""You'd really go to your first wedding since we got married without me?"" I told her she said I could go by myself a few months ago, and said I really missed some friends who I knew would be there. She argued that a lot of them didn't even come to ours, so why would I go up to see them? (Many of them were not invited due to our budget, or couldn't come because of personal conflicts.)

This argument took place roughly 2-3 weeks before their wedding, so I canceled my RSVP asap and apologized to the bride profusely. I'll probably send them a wedding gift in both of our names.

So now I will be sitting at home on a Saturday night with my dogs while my wife works instead of attending my friend's wedding and seeing a bunch of old college friends.

My 6 month old dog is pretty good around the house and hasn't peed/pood for about a month, he goes to the back door when he needs to go to the bathroom. When he did pee/poo I cleaned it straight away. My Step mother's 10 year old dog pees and poops all over the place and she just puts a tissue over it 99% of the time. Obviously this annoys my dad a lot so he wants to put the dogs in the kitchen, the problem is that my dad wants my dog in the kitchen despite him making none of the mess. His reasoning for this is that he doesn't want to deal with my step mother getting jealous that my dog is out of the kitchen while her's are in the kitchen, I don't think it's fair to keep my dog in the kitchen when he's done nothing wrong.

c4cghh	2019-06-23 21:37:25		AITA for fighting with two Karens and their drunk friends?	"My boyf (M19) and I (F18) got front-row tickets to this concert. As the guest performers come on, we start to notice these older ladies behind us who are complaining really loudly about PEOPLE FILMING, SHOUTING, OVERCROWDING AND PUSHING?? Just every thing that happens at a concert. They start to make it obvious that they’re complaining about us. I turn around and tell her, “I just want to let you know that I have a poster and I’ll only be lifting it up when he gets really close, and only for a short amount of time.” The short and fat one says, “OkAy bUT onLY fOr A shOrT TiMe, hEy? We aLL waNT To sEE, OkaY?”

Just before the main act comes on, they’re basically shouting over our shoulder, “Geez, hey? What’s up with the filming? Some people REALLY need to stop pushing!!!” I turn around and say, “With all due respect, can you please stop complaining?” 

They gave me the biggest fucking death-stare I’ve ever received, and it’s time for my boyf to do damage control. He says that it really isn’t us that are pushing, it’s the whole crowd that forces everyone to move, and that there’s no space for anyone’s mansion. They try to reprimand us, and start to taunt us by saying that we’re 12 years old. I get really pissed at this point, and somewhere along the line, I let slip that they’re FIFTY years old, so they need to stop mentioning my age. They get REALLY TRIGGERED by this and they’re literally asking people in an incredulous tone whether they look 50 or not. Looks like I’ve hit a soft spot. People start to get pushy and it’s reaching a physical fight. They start talking to these drunk ADULTS behind them who are obviously on their side, and they start to ask us dumb questions like, “Hey, 12 year olds, you want some alcohol?”

My boyf says, “Do you even know what’s happening? You’re drunk aren’t you? Stay out of it.” Another ADULT starts to shout that we should let him know when we start fighting so he can film it. They start to mention how our parents didn’t raise us right, and I see red. I shout at them and tell them that they don’t know a thing about us or our parents or what they’ve been through. 

Towards the end of the show, the taller and thinner one starts to imitate my scream, and I ignore her the first two times. On the third time, I’ve had enough, so I turn around and smile REEEEEAAAAALLLLYYYY fucking hard and say, “What a waste of time and money to be angry during the whole concert, don’t you think?” The look on her face was priceless. When I told my parents, they said that they’re really disappointed in us for losing our cool with an elder like that.

So yes, prime time for children showing up to a children's movie, totally get it. Everything was fine until an incredibly emotional and relatively quiet scene towards the end of the movie, when a child in our row (around 4-7? bad at gauging ages, plus it was dark) started standing up and walking around and talking to her mom at normal volume. She wasn't blocking anybody's view or anything, but the talking was definitely distracting because, again, this was a quieter scene. This went on for a couple of minutes, until finally I had enough and almost by instinct shushed the girl. If it was a scene earlier in the movie I probably wouldn't have, this was just a rather climatic and emotional one.

&#x200B;

I know she's just a child and I honestly don't even blame her, kids have short attention spans and that's just what they do. I guess my shush was more directed at her parents who were letting her jabber on for 5 minutes straight instead of taking her outside. My friends said I shouldn't have said anything because she's a kid at a kid's movie at 1 pm on a rainy Sunday during opening weekend, so what did I expect? I honestly do see their point, and I get how being shushed by a strange adult would really suck as a kid (I don't think they heard me but that probably shouldn't factor if the act itself was asshole-ish or not), but if you take your kid to a movie you have to be willing to take them out if they start making noise so they don't ruin the experience for other people.

I was taking end of the year pictures with all of my friends, and I had taken some in the classes before, and my classmate (who I’ll call Dave) knew this. He had friends in my previous class who told him. I used to be close to Dave, we almost dated until I realized his only traits were being funny or being a douche. He also constantly hits on my friends after the whole “I don’t want to date you” ordeal, and they often describe him as creepy and touchy-feely towards them after what happened with us. I still didn’t want to be friends with him after everything he’s done towards me and my friends, and I’ve made it clear plenty of times. 
He approached me at the end of the class period and said, “Let’s take a picture together.” I didn’t want too, so I said “No!” There was a pause, then I said “I don’t like taking pictures.” He looked hurt for a second there, to which I turned away with one of my friends. (One of the girls he’s repeatedly hit on despite her telling him her lack of interest/I’ll call her Amy) I was walking away with Amy, when she started snickering. Amy has the most contagious laughter, so I laughed too. We both knew what we were laughing at, and I didn’t care too see if Dave was looking. So when the bell rang, one of Dave’s friends came up to me and said “I hope you’re happy,” and at the time I could’ve cared less, but now, I feel like I should’ve just taken the damn picture.

I am a single mom (23) with a daughter (3), so I am quite new to the parenting scene, and I don’t think I should be buying my kid many toys. I want to raise her to be , but I also want her to be happy. Most of the things I buy her are books, art supplies, legos, and even video games (I myself am an avid gamer). 

I do this because I am not really a very materialistic person, and I’ve seen people who raise their children on materialism and their kids end up quite spoiled. I want to nourish her mind both academically and creatively in a fun way. This is also a way that I bond with her, since I can help her out/teach her new things. She seems to like it, but idk if it will be a bad thing in the long run. I don’t want to make her unhappy.

So am I doing okay now, or should I buy her some toys. If so, which ones? Idk I’m just really new to all of this and I want to put her with her best foot forward.

Edit: I also forgot to mention I am currently in my 3rd year medical school, and I really don’t want to make her feel like an afterthought/second priority.

"So for context my dad has this friend that had a very bad drug addiction in the past and that combined with some mental problems he fucked up his whole life and now that he's better his house is a mess, he doesn't have wifi or basic needs. But ever since he's better he comes over every evening to watch tv, netflix and have a hot meal. 

So this evening I got the brilliant idea to watch Kingsman but I had to watch it through my dads pc and display on the tv. The only problem is that my sister has been asking me and my dad to download the new sims 4 dlc, so while I was starting the movie she asked me to search for the dlc, only search, maybe download but not play because we were using my dads pc and.

So I searched and found it and started the download on my dads pc for her to play the next day, until all of a sudden my sister gets mad because I'm selfish bastard for using the pc even though she's been waiting for the dlc a eternity (she's only been asking about it for 2 days orso) and we needed to use the tv for the movie and not the pc (we could't tho because dutcb subtitles wouldn't work) and eventuallu she starts yelling, screaming, calling me, my dad names and stuff like that. At some point I was like fine I'll download it on my pc so she can play and all is good, the download was only going to take 20 mins so no big deal. Then when it was downloading she gets mad again because it was taking way too long and I should have just let her go on my dads pc because she's been waiting longer, even though I called dibs first to use the pc for the movie, which was in the best interest of my dads friend because he hadn't seen it yet and it's a really fun movie.

Eventually my dad let her have her way and she got the computer which didn't work out because the only 2 downloads where already used and she had to wait an hour for the download. And me and my dads friend had to watch without subtitles which wouldn't have worked because his english is really bad. So we watched normal tv instead

So all I'm asking was I the asshole, or was she, because the way I see it she ruined everyone's evening because she didn't want to play on my pc.

I'm really mad right now because she was being a total dick and got her way eventually.

I really have two reasons, but mainly it's because I refuse to participate in any outside of work events with how things are these days.

c4c6uz	2019-06-23 21:22:09	Sarcastic_Troll	AITA for destroying my wife's bra in the laundry?	"Really scared here guys. My wife left some laundry for me to do. I know her bras are supposed to be separate and on delicate. She's shown me how and everything. 

So I sorted all the laundry and wasn't paying much attention I guess. I overlooked some of her bras and panties. Threw them in with the rest of the stuff and washed and dried them.

One bra looks like it got mangled. And I know it's one of her favorite more expensive bras. I know I'm in trouble, but I think it's unjustified. Rite? It was an accident. She's pissed. From angry to yelling then she screamed at me like I did it on purpose or something. Now she left to go cry to a friend's house cause my dumbass self told her she was overreacting. Which is how that screaming started. Now she says I'm an insensitive, dumb asshole who can't figure out how to do laundry.  When she's shown me two times how to wash her shit and apparently I don't care enough to pay attention. But when it comes to school I'm all so perfect so I care more about that then I do her precious bras. Now, I've done the laundry just like her. Sure, occasionally I mess up. She does too.

It really was an accident. AITA anyway? And double question, AITA for telling her she was overreacting and to calm the fuck down over an accident? And I do love her and care more about her than school and she knows that. Also, she can overreact a lot.

Edit: About 80 comments and counting. Cool. So, the verdict I'm seeing is that for telling her she's overreacting and to calm the fuck down was an asshole thing to do. However on being an asshole about messing up her bra on accident seems to be mixed. I appreciate all the responses. Now that we both calmed down and she came back she did admit to overreacting and we talked about how we both were so stressed cause with me being so sick, especially after I just signed up for some mid summer classes (that luckily don't start for a bit) which was expensive to our credit card. So, when I don't go into work, I don't get paid. So she's stressed cause she's trying to make up the gap by working more. I can't afford a hospital bill so I had to promise the doc that I could manage pnemonia from home and I find out if that was successful on Tuesday. Wish me luck please cause I'm gonna kill someone if I can't work soon. I hate sitting around all day. So thanks for the responses

Edit 2: Thanks to everyone for cool laundry ideas and tricks.

Mods, you can stamp that with me being an asshole if you'd like to. I didn't really consider what she was going through and the stress she was under. While I still think it was an overreaction, I think she was justifiable in it. And dumb me never thought it was about anything else but the bra. And I was careless.

So, I'm an asshole and once I'm better and we get caught up some more income wise I gonna find a way for her to feel special. I'm also going to stop responding to comments now so feel free to leave your judgement if you want, but I think I sounded enough like a broken record, lol. Thanks for all who did respond, I tried to reach out to everyone."	Asshole	0	0	401.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

My mum frequently has Friends over (one is going to live with us with her kid from September onwards) up to 4 days a week. Most of the time i try to make dinner for all of them too because my mom and i are very hospitable. the Problem is that after i cook, which btw Always takes me an hour or more (unless i do something quick like scrambled eggs or so), my mom always refuses to HELP me clean up and says since im the one cooking i should be the one doing the dishes too. now i dont expect her to do it by herself, but it would be nice to have her at least helping. well ok u could argue she Pays the bills, and i get that, but now theres this other Person that is going to live with us soon. she is here every Weekend and she says the exact same Thing to me whenever i want them to help me clean up. 

&#x200B;

Since None of them want to help me, i decided to not do the dishes either. That was a few months ago, and the 3 of us have argued a lot since then. they frequently tell me im not allowed to cook anymore because i never clean up the mess, but a few days later Always ask me if i can make Pancakes or some other shit.

c4c27m	2019-06-23 21:15:03	thatindigoguy	AITA for asking my housemate to buy a new bookcase to replace the one in the living room, that she took and swapped with a desk?	"In our living room there has been a bookcase there. It was quite big, about 5 or 6 shelves high. There was plenty of room as others hadn't put much stuff there. A few weeks ago I started using one of the shelves for my books and plan to keep expanding, within reason

Today I go up and the living room has been rearranged. One of the things I noticed was the bookcase was gone, a desk was there instead, and my books were on the windowsill.

I asked my housemate ""what's going on?""

She said she took the bookcase to her room and has filled it up with various possessions, and moved the desk that she didn't want into the living room. And she said the windowsill thing was temporary and she was going to move them on to the desk she moved in.

I said to her that was already being used for my books, and a few things from other housemates, and ""could you move it back please?"" She said the desk was there now, and that I can quite easily put my books there. 

I said firstly: I don't want to use a desk, I want to use the bookcase for my books, it belongs to all of us not just you. Secondly you didn't even ask anyone before doing it.

She just can't see my complaints at all and thinks I'm being petty over not wanting to use the desk. She also said my books weren't so many that they can't fit on the desk. But I will be buying more...and other people might want to use it at some point.

So in the end I said ""if you aren't going to move it back, can you buy a new bookcase for the living room please?"" She doesn't want to. This is frustrating as we are generally on very good terms.

Haven't spoken to other housemates yet, don't know if they've even seen it.

Is it an arsehole move to ask her to buy a bookcase considering they're generally pretty expensive?

I can't force her to buy one, and it would probably be problematic if I went and physically moved it back myself so how can this be resolved without being an arsehole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	81.0	65.0	0.0	0.0

Me and my eldest son decided that we needed to make a room bigger. In order to achieve this, we needed to remove a large brick wall containing around 750 bricks. We started to work around midday and soon after we started, I decided that I wanted to keep the bricks for something else. I got something to put the bricks on to get them outside easier. We started pretty efficiently and got the first load in a few minutes. We went outside and dumped them on the yard deciding that I would organize them later. When I entered the house to continue working, I spotted my youngest son, 14, picking up random rubble. Then I got the idea to make him organize them. It wasn't too hot outside but it was a bit sunny, but nothing to worry about. He went outside a started the organization process. A few minutes pass and we finish another load. We take the bricks outside and he had organized most (note each load was around 100 bricks) We just dump the load and continue. Visibly annoyed, he starts organizing the rest. Fast forward two more loads and he looks fiscally tired and complaining silently. He goes inside ignoring my orders to go back to work. He mutters something but we leave him and dump the load. Eventually he returns to organizing again. I think this was the perfect opportunity to teach him responsibility and make him learn more and get stronger. This continues for around an hour. By this time he has slowed down a bit and we just dumped the rest of the load. We're done removing every brick, but many are still laying outside. For a bit, we start helping him, but he looked like he had regained strength so we left him at it. This was also a lesson of perseverance in my opinion

So reddit, what do you think 
(From Mobile)

Edit: We come from a poor family, that's why I decided to keep the bricks. Because of this, I was unable to pay them, but I did take them out for a snack as a token of my appreciation afterwards."	Asshole	0	0	26.0	31.0	0.0	0.0

To give some background, my gf was born and raised in a very catholic country in Europe and although she doesn't claim to be catholic herself, she is religious and believes the church to have sanctity.
Anyway, we were walking home from a bar and I had to take a leak pretty badly. On our way home we were passing a church that I saw provided some privacy from the public for me to do the deed. However, my girlfriend objected citing her belief that it would be disrespectful for me to pee on this sacred building. I respected her wishes and found a large tree to do my business instead.
Afterwards, she told me she couldn't believe I would even consider doing something so disrespectful because many people (her included) see it as desecration. I conceded that I definitely would not do this with other people around, or with her in my presence because she feels strongly about the sanctity of the church, but if I were alone I would have no qualms about taking a leak on a pile of bricks, especially since it would have no impact on anybody in any way. She maintained that it is disrespectful to do regardless, even if nobody is watching and at that point we just agreed to disagree, but she said that she thinks I'm closed minded now, and she sees me in a slightly more negative light because of this conversation. I think I'm just being pragmatic.

One day he left my bed and didn’t say anything and that was it. Next thing I knew he was dating/in a relationship with Madison. I was shocked and hurt and couldn’t believe. Madison was new to the group and had no idea of mine and John’s past. 
I was close with the group, but it was John’s group mostly, so I separated myself and didn’t spend much time with them for a while. I got myself into a good space mentally before getting back into the group dynamic. Everything was fine for a while and I ended up really liking Madison. We slowly started becoming good friends and I definitely saw why John preferred her to me. I came to terms with it and didn’t want to lose friendships over it. Madison did not know about our pasts. 
After about 5 months, Madison broke up with John. She was knew to the area so the friends she made, she wanted to keep. She especially felt a connection to me even though I tried to keep her at arms length due to our past connections. 
A couple of months passed and we slowly became better friends
My birthday happened and John came to hang out as well. Madison had to leave (due to a date) and John was getting very close to me, holding my hand and such and we ended up going home together that night. That was last July and we still sleep together about twice a month. Madison and I have done nothing but become closer friends. Madison still doesn’t know.

&#x200B;

here goes: I've had anxiety for a lot of my life, and I come from a well-off family not rich, but they sometimes help me out with bills. anyway, I have talked about my anxiety to my close friends on my Instagram story, and I recently talked to my friend about how I felt too privileged to have anxiety over things like ""where my parents think I should fit into this world"" and that kind of stuff. 

So she answered in the ways of ""you should try to relax and enjoy that you are lucky to be in such a good family and enjoy what they give you"". This didn't upset me, it just made me rethink my perspective and I decided to add to my Instagram story about it. I told her id try it but it's more difficult than you think, it often feels more like I'm being bought off by my own family for the service of smiling and keeping quiet. I didn't mention her, I simply added how my privilege didn't make much difference. I didn't tag her or write in anger, though I tried to get my message across about how I felt trapped sometimes by my family's expectations. She answered me personally  bit later with ""thanks for the answer, tag me next time, xoxo.""

&#x200B;

So as I said earlier, this is small stuff but I'm not sure if I'm the asshole just for adding more to my story about personal issues. I felt a bit bad about it but after rereading my message in the Instagram story, I felt like the things we talked about was a very small portion of my message. I don't know how to fix whatever is ruined, however, I don't feel guilty.

"I just finished a one-week course for young adults, and during this time, I started talking a lot with a girl named Abigail. She was shy at first but seemed to like talking to me, so we would hang out during break or just work together during class. At this time I notice that my other friend, Isaiah, started talking with her too.

Anyways, the last day of class comes, and me and Abigail are talking about food right before our lunch break. I learn that she loves Popeyes to death, and having never done anything but talk in class and it being our last day together, I offer to take her there during our break, and she agrees. We have a blast and exchange numbers at this point. When we get back to class, Isaiah notices us together and asks if we went out to eat. I said yes. This is where his entire demeanor changes and he gets noticeably more quiet during class (He sits next to me.) We have about 20 minutes of class left, and Isaiah has barely said anything the whole time up until this point, when he suddenly says ""You know she's 19, right?"" Like I said in the beginning, the class is for young adults, so anyone from 16-24 years of age can join, and I figured he was bringing this up to say I was too old for her. I am 22. I tell him that yes, I know, and ask him what his point is. Like I predicted, he says it's ""kinda weird"" for a 22 year old to go out with a 19 year old. I tell him it's really not because it's only a 3 year difference. I should point out here that Isaiah is 16, and that the same 3 year difference applies to him, but I didn't tell him this. At this point, my suspicion of him liking her is confirmed. 

Class ends, and Abigail is the first one out. Isaiah basically rushes out the door to meet her in the lobby where she waits for her ride home. When I get to the lobby, Isaiah is talking to her, and not wanting to intrude, I continue walking and head outside to say goodbye to a few of my other classmates. After about 10 minutes, Abigail comes out since her ride was here and we happily say our goodbyes. Isaiah at this point comes out and straight up tells me that he asked her out too, and that her response was that she will think about it. I ask him why he asked her out when he knew we were starting to go out together ourselves. He tells me it was a dick move that I asked her out in the first place when I knew he liked her. I tell him that I wasn't sure whether he liked her or not, and that he literally just did what he is accusing me of. This back and forth went on until he left. 

I know the situation sucks because I've been there before, but I think his emotions are clouding his judgement. If someone likes someone, I think you should respect their decision whether you yourself like it or not. Abigail and I have made further plans, and since it was our last day of class I'm pretty sure I'll never see Isaiah again, but I'm curious as to what you all make of this mess. Was I the asshole?"

c4blpw	2019-06-23 20:49:31	GREEMANFROMFUTURE	AITA for not giving up on my business, as my wife is insisting?	"5 years ago I got out of the military and was looking for work. I started a small business of personal training. It started out slow, but I built a client base and was successful. Two years in, I started transforming it into an actual business rather than a service I was selling, and hired my first three employees.

&#x200B;

After that, things have been wonderful. Some time ago, I landed my biggest contract up to that point. I was contracted to offer personal training services to the cheerleading squad for two different professional football teams within about 3 months of each other. Most of the cheerleaders had other jobs and were models (or trying to become models), so word of mouth got me a lot of recommendations in the modeling and fashion industry.

&#x200B;

About 3 months ago a rather high profile woman contracted my services. She agreed to pay a premium in order for my business to meet her very tight schedule. She has extremely aggressive goals she needs to meet in a 6 month (now 3 month) timeline, so she's been the only client I'm personally training and represents about 40% of our revenue (but revenue is up 150% YOY, so we're still expanding elsewhere and not putting all our eggs in one basket.)

Anyway, I'm spending about 4 hours a day at her home gym for actual training, and another 1 hour a day or so for nutrition, education, etc. And behind the scenes I'm probably spending another 2 hours a day on her program and then 4-5 hours a day actually running my business. So it's been busy. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, my wife is getting angry because I'm spending more hours per day with this woman than I am with my wife. But my wife can't seem to understand this is a business, and she's a client. I think a lot of that anger is just jealousy like ""oh, some woman is trying to steal my husband.""

&#x200B;

She wants me to take a step back from my business and just manage and not actually do anything. I'm saying no - that's a lot of money to give up.

"I’ve [35M] known my friend Jen [33F] for 15+ years and am one of the few close friends she has. Jen and her ex Chris have been going through a friendly divorce but it’s gotten tricky.

I met her ex from the very beginning of their relationship and have been with them through their highs and lows, and even during their pending divorce. I became really good friends with him through the years and we are friends even during this awkward time for all of us. Without going into details, she’s the reason for the divorce.

Well turns out her Chris started dating one of my second cousins Lisa without telling me for a few months. They had met on a big group trip last year (Jen and Chris were already separated and she didn’t go on this trip). Nothing happened between Chris and Lisa but I guess they hung out 6 months later and are now in a relationship.

I had told Chris that I wasn’t happy that he didn’t tell me that he and Lisa were dating in the beginning and I knew that Jen would be mad. I told him to tell her but he said he was not ready yet. After a few weeks I decided not to tell Jen because I didn’t want to get in the middle of anything.

We’ll zoom forward last week Jen messages me and she’s pissed: she found out about Lisa and Chris and she says it’s fucked up I didn’t say anything and that I’m a bad friend by choosing his side.

Not sure how to feel right now. Ultimately I was in a bad position and tried to do what was easiest for all of us, but I do see it from her point of view.

I (16) don't like to go our to eat with them for these reasons (and I have talked to them about every point) :

1. I can't eat anything (except for maybe a salad) at the restaurant we go to 80% of the time. I don't get to chose the restaurant, so I have to fill up on salads. 
2. They don't talk to me. They talk amongst themselves, and I am left to entertain myself. 
3. I just don't like going out to eat. The restaurants we go to are very loud and have no AC. I would happily stay at home. They say I need to go because it's a family outing, but I think there are other ways to spend time with the family. 
4. I prefer to cook my own dinner, because I am picky and like it a certain way. 

Saying this, I don't put up a fight every time we go out to eat. I am simply aggravated that they drag me to a place I clearly don't want to be. My parents do a lot for me. We have a good relationship. I simply want to stop going out to eat so often and to the same restaurant. I talked to them why I didn't want to go, and they don't listen.

He was the best person I ever knew. He taught me everything I know. He supported me in every way possible. He was kind, fair and strong man. 

He had brain tumor. It took him away within six month. Me, my mom and my two eldest brothers stayed with him 24/7 taking care while doctors tried to figure out what was going on. It was tough. Doctors came up with the real diagnosis just 23 days before he passed away, there was nothing we could do. 

I miss him so much. But I didn't cry at the funerals, I didn't cry after. My mom lost the love of her life so she was the one who cried a lot. She cried silently and sometimes secretly since the day dad's health condition started getting worse. They both needed support so I couldn't afford myself to do the same. But as the time went by she accepted the fact that dad was incurable. My brothers also are that type of people who keep everything inside.

My granny (mother of my dad) and my aunt (sister of my dad) otherwise both were crying out loud and almost screaming at the funerals. Sometimes it looked like they have some kind of ""who if suffering more"" competition. I know they lost part of their family too but it seemed weird to me. Even now, when the time passed they still crying when they have to talk about dad. Not just crying but screaming. 

A lot of friends and people who knew him were crying  at the funerals also. And they are still showing sorrow everytime I or my mom meet them. 

Honestly, I think that there is no use in crying, tears will not bring him back, sometimes I feel that people should calm down it's been two weeks. Those tears are no help. I know I shouldn't say others how long they are suppose to grieve, but I thinks it's been enough. Life goes on.

Does it make me a bad person? Is there something wrong with me? Why am I not crying? Why am I not screaming or suffering? Am I allowed to live on?

Recently, my mother has been causing negative developments in our home life by saying petty things and having a general unpleasant attitude. It’s gotten so bad that it everyone in the household just seems upset and mellow. 

I tried politely talking to her, telling her to keep her cool and remind her that she’s moving out soon, but she sees it as me antagonizing her.

I’m fed up with it. I try and give her advice regarding her temperament but she won’t listen. And so, I’ve decided to take away her ticket for my graduation ceremony. I don’t want negative energy on a day that I will remember for the rest of my life. I’m planning on telling her that she cannot come, and regardless of her answer I will be taking away her ticket.

c4b7wt	2019-06-23 20:27:55	Perfect_Butterscotch	AITA For Reading My Mom's Texts?	"\*Throwaway account for obvious reasons, TLDR at the bottom

&#x200B;

I have been in a pretty bad depression for the past two or three months. On Tuesday night, last week, I had a bit of a mental breakdown/anxiety attack after getting into a fight with a friend (being referred to as Ben) because I texted him to ask to talk and he said he didn't want to argue with me and then went MIA (it turns out that his parents took his phone and he wasn't mad at me, we put everything in the past and are in a much better place now). I wouldn't tell my parents the reasoning for my anxiety attack but another friend (lets call her Kate) was texting me and helping me deal with it throughout the night, leading to a pretty high number of texts back and forth (almost 300-400).

My parents have a Verizon feature called Smart Family, which enables them to see who I text and when, but not the contents. They can only see SMS, but I use an android so that is the only way for me to actually text. 

Kate has a different area code, so my parents were curious to see who this number belonged to. Throughout the week, I haven't been talking to them because they keep pressuring me to tell them what happened even though I explained that I put it behind me and don't want to bring it back up because it was very ugly but is resolved and over.

They didn't feel comfortable approaching me to ask who's number it was, which is understandable because I was pretty cranky, but my parents and I were still texting me on a regular basis and could have asked me there. I would have been happy to tell them. Instead, my mom decided to anonymously call Kate, see who picked up and then hang up. My friend recognized my mom's voice and asked if it was my mom but I had no idea if it was her and and my mom denied it.

Ben's mom is friends with my mom so I assumed that my mom got Kate's number from Ben's mom, even though my mom said it was just a lucky guess. However, I have other friends with the same area code and when my mom gave me her phone in the car to send a text to someone, I looked at the texts and confirmed my suspicion. 

My mom admitted it and I confirmed what she did to Kate. I am having a birthday party next week and now Kate doesn't feel comfortable because she feels that my mom violated her privacy and made her super uncomfortable, something that I totally agree with.

AITA for doing this?

TLDR: Had a bad anxiety attack. Mom reads phone and sees a number she doesn't recognize. She feels that I am unapproachable and instead of asking, calls the number, which creeps out my friend and makes her feel uncomfortable. I confirmed this by reading her texts. AITA?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that my mom does not know what I did, I just feel super bad about it and other friends said it was a step too far. Also edited for more clarity."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My 17 year old daughter is “a good girl”. Straight As, honors classes, into sports, helpful around the house, generally doesn’t cause much trouble. 

Last night, she had a sleepover with her two friends. The host friends parents were out of town for the evening, but an adult sibling was there and the three slumber party was sanctioned by all parents involved because the girls haven’t ever been in any trouble (that we know of) and are trusted.  The plan apparently was to “eat a lot of junk food and binge Netflix”

That’s not what happened. The third girl was picked up at around 11 pm to go suck off some random kid from their school in exchange for a bag of weed. After a 3 hour joy ride, she finally came home and all 3 girls got high as a kite. There may have been some drinking and other debauchery but I’ve outlined the most questionable of the behavior.

So for some background, my friend hates the state of politics right now and he rails against those of a certain political party with a personal vendetta. I have listened to this friend railing and ranting for about a year before I straight up told him that I do not want to hear him being angry and hateful towards an entire group of people. I have told him multiple times before it came crashing down in a large arguement a couple months ago where he understood that I'm sick of hearing it. 


Fast forward to last night where a few buddies of mine were yucking up politics in a completely different reguard to what he would have wanted to talk about. He tried to steer it towards his anger and towards these people and we mostly ignored him. He tried to interject the conversation multiple times,and we just kept talking about what we were talking about. 


Here's my issue. I have told him multiple times that this is an issue for me, and multiple times he has either chosen to ignore me, or got into a passionate fever reguardless of my feelings in the matter. It's not even about the politics anymore, its flat out about feeling disrespected. I'm at a point where I'm thinking about telling him that if he does it one more time, then I'm done with him and he will never see me again.

c4b3hx	2019-06-23 20:20:56	The_Answer01	WIBTA if I intentionally missed my family’s party/get-together for the 4th of July?	"New account, first post, been lurking etc. 

For some background, I (19M) am about to go to college in the northeast and I’m having a lot of trouble finding an temporary apartment before I get deployed. Because of this, I’ve been making phone calls daily and spending a lot of time trying to secure a place, still with little results. In the beginning of June, I told my father (divorced) that I’d be able to come down on the 4th of July after my national guard annual training and the my mandatory college orientation that ends late on the 2nd of July.

The problem is, My father’s told the whole family, that I would drive down to his house by the 4th to be with everyone. Admittedly, these gatherings happen very infrequently now, but I’ve only been able to set up an appointment/viewing with one apartment so far and the earliest it could be is on the 3rd. I’d probably want to tour some other places nearby though. If I took the right amount of time, really considering all my options and looking for more, it would easily take me until or past the 4th and I would probably drive down on the 5th or later (7 hour drive). This would effectively make me miss the family gathering and probably a few family members who could only come down for that day.

My father called me the other day, just to check up on things, and did not take this news well. I started out by explaining to him that I didn’t know the exact time frames and may or may not be able to get down by that time. Basically, trying to explain that my life caught up a bit and there’s not much I can do. I think he thought I was bullshitting a bit, so he kind of laughed as he said over and over that I better make it work and come down at the time I said I would. Or, to just try to find the apartment at a later date. I told him I can’t do that also because of certain deadlines I need to make for the college/my own security. Eventually I got annoyed and told him that finding a place for me to live while I go to college is far more important than going to their get-together and the family would survive if I wasn’t there. He abruptly and angrily said goodbye then hung up the phone, not calling back since.

I really want to make sure I have a place secured for college ASAP, and that will definitely take me past the 4th if I take my time with it as I should. I know, however, that my father would not be happy with this choice at all and his side of the family would probably agree with him. It also seemed like my mom thought I took it a bit far when I talked to her about it. He has always been much more traditional when it comes to “familial obligations” than I am. So WIBTA if I missed this and prioritized finding an apartment? 

On a side note, I really hate going down to his house and with that side of the family because I have to experience all their abusive and loveless relationships every day."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

My gap year has just started and I have applied for universal credit which is basically a benefit for people that are unemployed/low income (£250 per month). My narcissistic mother (go to r/raisedbynarcissists if you do not know what this is) and her equally narcissistic husband constantly whines and yells at me everyday since I was atleast 15 to get a job for their own personal gain. These egotistical motherfuckers call me selfish every single day simply because I don't make them money. An hour ago my nmom told me in her a sly, insulting way that when I do get my universal credit, I must pay for groceries, rent etc. I calmly told her no as this is not my responsibility and I need a lot of money to fund for uni. Plus the money I will make is no where near as much as my nmom and nstepdad make so she is just being money hungry tbh. Then I walked out of the room as she got pissed and told me I am selfish (as usual). She also started yelling that since she payed for groceries when she was on benefits, I have to do so too. Am I the asshole for refusing to give her money? Also, she doesn't even bother paying for groceries herself anyway, there is barely any food in the house even when I tell her to. This is not because she has a lack of money but because she simply can't be bothered. Not to mention that she justifies my nstepdads abusive and childish behaviour by saying that since he makes money, I must respect and obey him...so if he makes so much money why the fuck does she need money from me? Plus, like I said, even I can't pay because I need a lot of money for uni.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

For background, me and my friends are all young but for privacy let’s just say we’re below the age of consent for my country. 

So, my friends have no filter with their affection. For example, during a mini argument between me and my boyfriend they continued to be openly flirty and would make out in front of us, knowing our relationship was kind of rough. This alone pissed me off, and I kind of have been irritated at them since, but that’s not the main reason why I asked them to stop. We had all been hanging out at my male friends’ house (who’s the guy in the relationship I told off) and he and his girlfriend are kissing when she starts straddling him (she denies this now but I know what I saw). This makes me uncomfortable, so I ask “Can you guys not?” My friend, who I have known my whole life, the girlfriend, looks at me, and just says “you and (boyfriend) have done the same in front of us.” This irritated me, as even though we have done that a couple times, we always made sure we didn’t do much in front of them, as we are private people. So Reddit, AITA?

I am currently working at a hotel in a small town and make one dollar above minimum wage per hour. I worked here for 10 months before, got laid off and was collecting EI (around 40% of my checks were going to rent and insurance), and now one week ago got my job back. I attended college a few years ago and am now $20K in debt, and my mom was the one who encouraged me to attend school as I was doing nothing with my spare time.

She had promised she would pay for half of my student loans and I agreed.

Back to the living situation. I have been paying about 500 a month for rent and insurance, which equates to 1/4 of living expenses between my parents my brother and I. We recently moved in to a new more expensive house, and my brother had promised my parents that he would stay for two years just to help make sure everything was situated and they were stable before he moved out. He moved out after a year, and they still help him by bringing home groceries and taking him leftovers etc..

My mom just told me today starting August she will be increasing my rent by 200$ a month, due to the fact that she doesn't feel she can ""continue supporting everyone in the house"". I just feel its extremely unfair because I'm trying to save up to move out with my girlfriend, but I'm being charged more and more in rent. I already help them out with chores and if they need money for anything in an emergency I transfer them and they pay me back or deduct it from the current rent. It just frustrates me because she is constantly getting her nails done, buying packs of smokes, and they tend to order out more often than they should.

I just want to know what everyone's opinions are. I am open to critiques or advice from anyone, and I'm not sure what my next step should be."	Not the A-hole	0	0	36.0	16.0	0.0	0.0

c4aygj	2019-06-23 20:12:54	theonlyjambo	AITA for not telling my gf that my best friend spoiled her surprise gift?	"For my birthday, my gf wanted to surprise me with tickets for a musical I always wanted to see but was just way too expensive.  It was in a different city so she told my best friend to tell me that he really needed my help with a house moving and I had to keep the whole Saturday (yesterday) free so we could take a three hour car drive there and get back in the night.

He is a really bad liar and when I started to ask who was moving and why I had to save the whole day, he accidentally spoiled the surprise. He was really really disappointed at himself but I promised him that I wouldnt tell her a damn thing and act surprised when she was going to reveal the surprise. In the past days, she made some remarks that hinted what was going on but I acted as if I didnt know what was going on. But I somehow must have given her the impression that I knew what was going on because I am really bad at faking something myself. At some point she just said ""you know it, dont you?"" and I replied ""yeah..."" . She was FURIOUS like I have never seen before and started crying and wanted to cancel the whole thing because she felt that I made a fool out of her and I should have just  told her before. She was trying her best to keep it a secret from my friends and family and invested a lot of time to keep me ""busy"" and I tried to play the act. She said that it meant the world to her to give me the chance to see the musical and it would have been much better if I was honest to her instead of hiding everything.

I really didnt want to tell her because she seemed really excited about the whole thing and I wanted her to unveil the surprise and not just tell her that my best bud fucked up. We still went and it was a really awesome day, but I still feel bad about the whole thing."	No A-holes here	0	0	133.0	45.0	0.0	0.0

c4awpu	2019-06-23 20:10:04	less_bullshit_	AITA for not letting my grandmothers comment towards me go	"I apologize if this is formatted shitty I don't post often and I'm sure it shows

This happened a few minutes ago and I clearly need an outside opinion. About a month ago my mother kicked me(17f)  out of my house I had no where to go so my grandmother(61f) said I could move in with her and stay as long as needed. Since then I've noticed she will occasionally make rude or unnecessary comments to me about random things. One of which was about my makeup choice and how it made me look tired when this happened she made multiple comments telling me I looked tired and that she'd never seen someone want to purposely look like that. Now to the situation I came here for. I was in the living room watching a baseball game when she walked in said I just annoy the shit out of you don't I? She then walked back out of the room without saying anything else I followed her to the next room to ask what she meant and why she said that. When I asked she said she didn't want to argue and I insisted she tell me why she made that comment to which she said she didn't know she was just fucked up( referring to pain pills and pot) and in her head now leave her alone. I asked a few more times why she makes those comments then gets defensive and accuses me of starting a fight and again she just keep saying she was fucked up didn't want to fight and to leave her alone.

 I made it clear multiple times I wasn't mad and was trying to argue I just felt I deserved to know why she said that but it didn't seem to make a difference. She was never really this way before I moved in I mean we had disagreements like everyone does but never anything important or like this. So AITA? Should I have just kept ignoring her comments ? Is there another side to this that I'm just not seeing if so please enlighten me because I really am lost what to do about this."	Asshole	0	0	10.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

c4awh2	2019-06-23 20:09:43	leco5	AITA if I tell my husband to stop complimenting me?	"To clarify I am not one of those girls who can’t take a compliment. I appreciate a nice compliment and everything but in private I can be self conscious. And sometimes the general “you look good” compliments from my husband make me more self conscious than happy about my appearance. They make me hyper aware of my body and I’m more inclined to worry about my issues. I do this unless it’s a specific compliment about my ass or tits or how my clothes fit or something. My husband very rarely, if ever, actually pinpoints what he’s complimenting and I wish he would but I feel stupid so I’ve never brought it up.

I’m always trying to get better about appreciating my body. My husband doesn’t help with his obsession over his own weight and being adamant about all these diets and stuff for both of us. We’re not unhealthy or super overweight. Very average and normal, probably healthier than most. I go to the gym 4-5 times a week consistently. Some days I’m just extremely self conscious and my husbands super-general compliments spur my spiral of feeling self conscious and shitty.

This morning my husband threw me a casual “you look swell” while I was getting dressed. Exact words, which aren’t really super complimentary & my mind immediately goes to “swelling and swollen” lol but I try my best to take it at face value. I fail and instead just spiral internally. Thinking the worst possible thoughts ever about my body. So he caught on to my mood and asked me what’s up. I told him sometimes his general compliments make me super self conscious and I like when his compliments are more direct and specific. And I just told him I’m feeling extra self conscious today is all. He said a very cold “I’m sorry” and stopped talking to me. AITA here for basically telling him to stop complimenting me?

c4av2r	2019-06-23 20:07:32	Daiquila	AITA for going against my parents wishes?	"So for backstory, i am currently in college(first year) and I did band since freshman year high school. I made a lot of friends who are still in the band which I still keep in touch with. Every year the band director plans a trip for DCI(Drum Corp International) West. He allows friends and family of students as well as alumni.

In March I got the email about the DCI trip and I almost instantly went in to buy my ticket. It costed 40 dollars which included the ticket and a seat on a bus. At the time my parents were okay with me doing this. At the time I was excited to hear that another alumni who happened to be my crush happened to plan on going there too. I am also working to pay for gas, food and other stuff which is why I was able to go in the first place. In March I got pretty good hours, almost working five days a week for at least four hours a shift.

As of late May, my days and hours have been significantly reduced. My parents were upset that I was working less and making less money. I still wanted to go on the trip but it would coincide with a work day. I started looking for someone to cover my shift but I didn't tell my parents because I knew they'd flip if I told them my plan. After I was able to successfully get someone to cover my shift, I told my parents because at that point, there was nothing I or they could do. I was surprised that both my mom and dad were both mad, specifically my dad. I thought he'd be more understanding since he also did band during his high school years. Their point was that it was immature of me to pick friends over working, especially since I'm not working as much, and that I shouldn't be doing these band things with the high school since I'm already in college.

I talked to my high school band director and he agrees with me. He said that there is a bond that band members have with each other that most activities don't have.

c4au34	2019-06-23 20:05:56	aholethrowaway54	AITA for not wanting my husband to take a job?	"My hubby and I have been together for 8 years, married for 4, and are currently expecting our first child. He was offered a job that he's been trying to get for a couple years. His current job pays well but has a long commute, and isn't very fun for him. The new one would pay almost double and comes with very good benefits and is 10 minutes away, and it's in a field he got his degree for. The issue is the new job is somewhat dangerous, and his hours will be messed up. It's 40 hours a week, but the shifts change, and he will miss alot of special occasions and holidays and weekends. Neither of us knew the schedule would be like that when he was trying to get the job.

&#x200B;

Because we both agreed before getting married that we'd both be around to parent the kiddos, and because I don't want our family to have an absentee father, I asked him to turn down the job. He was pretty upset and refused. He said he wanted to support the baby. I love him for wanting to support us but the baby needs love and parenting more than extra money. His current job pays enough. He said he'd think about it. This happened Monday.

&#x200B;

He told me last night that he turned down the job on Friday. I was crying with happiness and pregnancy emotions. He was too, and we celebrated, but then he went to bed early, which he never does. This morning its like he's in a fog. He normally mows the lawn every Sunday like it's his church but he just watched TV all morning and barely ate his breakfast.

I know he's upset he turned down the job, but I think he made the right decision. Am I the asshole for thinking that?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4atwg	2019-06-23 20:05:39	uglyduckling106	AITA for telling my friend that he is disgusting?	"I feel like I'm really insensitive and a bad friend because I think his hygiene and behaviour are disgusting and I'm uncomfortable hanging out with him in real life. 
Yesterday I agreed on a sleepover at my house and to be honest it was awful (which I couldn't tell him... I feel bad.)
I never was at my friends place because he doesn't want me to and after he sent me one picture of his apartment I knew why. He is a messie, even though he doesn't agree on that. He collects bulky waste from outside and kinda sees worth in things that I and others consider trash. He continues to collect things even though his place is FULL. He even asked me twice if he can come over to shower because his stuff blocks the way to his shower. Nothing has changed on that. He only showers at others places or at his workplace. 
Showering is another thing. He sweats a lot and he doesn't think that he should shower at least every second day. My father even asked him if he wants to shower at our place because he smelled so bad. I didn't know if I should be ashamed of my dad for asking that directly or at my friend because of his bad hygiene. 
One day I told my friend that I don't want him to come over if he doesn't shower because it wasn't rare that I could only endure his smell if I sat at my wide opened window. (And my nose really isn't that good.)
Well, it got better, even though we don't see each other as regular as before.
Yesterday at the sleepover his behaviour was disgusting nonetheless. He picked his nose and ate the stuff in front of me, his nose was full of spit and he didn't bother to clean his nose. And then he wanted me to cuddle him and was mad at me for not wanting to. He also kept farting loudly. 
I slept in another room (living room) and in the next morning I went in my own room, where he slept, to see if he's already up. I said ""oh my god"" when I entered that room. He closed the blinds and the window and turned my room into a bad smelling sauna. My bed and my pillow were wet from his sweat and I know that it's actually not his fault but why couldn't he at least open the window or don't argue with me when I ask him if he could please shower.
I don't know if I'm overreacting but I don't feel like I can feel comfortable around him.
I told him over the weekend that I'm not comfortable with certain things and this resulted in arguing. He almost yelled at me. 
I actually don't know if I want him to come over again because it was just too much. Not only his lack of hygiene but also that I have to be extremely careful about what I say because every single thing might result in ruining his mood for the rest of the day. It's exhausting."

c4asnd	2019-06-23 20:03:40	CrownTheKingSlayer	WIBTA for taking back my fish tank and indirectly killing several fish?	"In the first year of living in my college apartment with my roommates T & B, I had been gifted a 6-gal fish tank and it became the centerpiece of our apartment. I put in a couple hundred of my own money maintaining it by buying plants and rocks and all that shit for my betta fish. T had his own betta fish from freshman year in his room in a 1-gal tank (which if you don't know is too small of an environment for that fish. Anyway, One of T & B's mutual friends accidentally killed my fish so instead of getting new fish I just let T put his fish in my tank so it could live a better life, but eventually that fish died from an infection.

The tank had become abandoned for several months, but for T's birthday, B went to the fish store and bought a bunch of fish and plants to surprise T with a new tank. The thing is B never asked for my permission to use the tank and all the stuff I bought and it kinda irked me but I didn't care at the time cause I wasn't using the tank anymore and it would be a good present to T. Since then, T takes care of the tank using mostly my equipment and some of his own that he bought but I warned him the tank is grossly overpopulated and he never really cared. There's now like 3 generations of fish in there and T loves the tank but I'm moving out in a month and want to restart my fish tank at my new place. I know if I ask T, he'll slowly start waning out the maintenance of the tank so eventually, all the fish can die and we can't take the fish back to the pet stores. I can live without the tank and buy a new one but I don't want to and I want it back despite all the work T's put into the tank in the last year on his own. I can't help but feel like a dick for taking back his birthday present.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Worth mentioning the gift was from my mom and T is pretty much always broke so him paying me for it isn't an option for him. The tank itself is worth at least $200 and the equipment is another $200. I can't afford to buy everything again and the amount of money B put in for the present is less than $20 because a lot of stuff was already established. T put in about $5 over the year of him using it."	Not the A-hole	0	0	355.0	28.0	0.0	0.0

c4aqhm	2019-06-23 20:00:19	DeleteAfterUse100	AITA for entering ex-boyfriend’s flat while he was out (let in by his flatmate), finding his camcorder, to delete a sex tape of us that he wanted to keep?	" 

It was a killer sticking to word limit!

Following happened in 2016.  

I was 33\[F\], he was 39\[M\]. On holiday, we had sex. On bedside table was the camcorder he brought to record his muay thai sessions. I playfully suggested we record us, thinking he’d take it as a joke. I instantly felt uncomfortable and regretted mentioning it when he got excited at the idea. But it was me who put the idea out there and I felt bad for taking it away from him. I said I don’t actually want to record us but the idea was now in his head, and I agreed we could record it as long as we delete after watching it. His response was, “Sure, we’ll watch it, if we don’t like it, we can delete it”. I was horny, and thought we had both agreed to the same thing – record, watch and delete. We had a great time.

The day we flew back home we had an argument and I ended things. It was a 16hr flight and we were both exhausted. We got to his, I grabbed my things and asked him to delete the sextape, he refused.

I felt vulnerable at the thought of him having ownership of this video in which I’m naked, especially if we’re no longer together. In his anger, he said “Well, how about I put it online!” He said these words out of hurt and fear of losing me, but saying them made me think there was a possibility that it could happen. He later said, “Obviously I’m not going to put it online!”

He hid his camera, left the flat, leaving me outside. I waited till he was gone. His flatmate opened the door to me and I asked if she could let me back in. She heard us arguing and was hesitant. I told her how we made a video on his camcorder, we’ve split up and he’s refusing to delete it. She said, “do what you have to do and let yourself out”.

I found the camcorder hidden under a pillow, and deleted the recording.

I stayed in a hotel. Next day he called me. I told him I don’t want to be with him and don’t trust him. It was a long conversation and I told him I deleted the video. He burst out crying and asked why, as it was special to him. He accused me of breaking and entering into his flat (even though his flatmate let me in) and asked me how I could even think about going through his possessions, and touching his belongings. He asked a lawyer friend if he could do anything about me deleting the video, and even tried to put fear in me by saying, “Well, I can recover it!”

Breaking and entering into someone’s home is not right, and had his flatmate not allowed me to enter, I would have left, and the sextape would still be there.

If he was the one who wanted to delete the video, I would respect that. His pain at the thought of keeping the video would overrule my pain of wanting to keep it. It’s such a vulnerable thing being naked on camera, and in order to make my partner feel safe/secure, I would delete it if I was asked, no matter how much I wanted to keep it.

c4aq9g	2019-06-23 19:59:57	metaisplayed	AITA for not wanting my parents “involved” in my potentially life threatening illness?	"So there’s a chance I could be really sick. To make a long story short, I’ve been dealing with some chronic pain that has not gotten better for the past few months. I’ve seen a couple doctors, the last of which ordered an MRI which did not look promising. The doctor seems torn between ordering a biopsy, getting a second opinion, and waiting a few months to get ANOTHER MRI to see if it gets worse. 

Obviously, I’m concerned but I’m more frustrated that the pain won’t be going away any time soon. However I plan to follow all of my doctors advice and take care of this to the best of my ability. What else can I do?

I’ve been updating my parents periodically, and they are not exactly cool, calm, or collected about all of this. I should mention that about 25 years ago, my older brother was stricken with a sudden illness that wound up killing him. He was 18, I was 13, and the trauma was one of the defining moments of my childhood. All of my family has been diagnosed with PTSD, including myself and my parents...well, they’ve been handling it the best they can, but their child died. Obviously that’s not something you ever fully recover from. 

Anyway, like I said I’ve been updating them periodically and they’re NOT handling it well. They’re panicking to be clear, and keep offering to be their for me for appointments, constantly want to talk to me about it and want to be informed about my condition. 

The thing is Reddit, I don’t WANT them to be around. I want to handle my own illness by myself. I know that sounds strange, but I can think of 0 benefit from having two incredibly stressed out people hovering over me constantly asking if I’m okay. It’s not helpful at all, and it’s only stressing me out more. 

I told them this and they said, “well, we’re going to worry ANYWAY, so you’re not helping US by not letting us help you .”

Okay?  I can certainly understand their need to be helpful but it doesn’t make me want them to be more involved. It makes me want to pull away even further. The illness is overwhelming enough without feeling like I have to appease them too. But apparently, from their perspective , that is what being a family is about.

c4aq90	2019-06-23 19:59:56	-smouses-	AITA for getting after unruly teenagers at the escape room I work at?	"I’m hoping this doesn’t seem like a “validation” post, because I honestly feel like maybe I’m the asshole here and didn’t handle this correctly. 

Anyway, as mentioned previously, I work at an escape room. In 3-4 days, about 10 groups of teens have consecutively broken 6 puzzles (which are not the easiest to replace), and have given such an attitude about it that a few of my employees have actually either started crying, or have had to go on break because they’re upset about it.

We’ve been mocked for sending hints that had information they already know in it (we have prewritten hints that are easier to use than typing up our own for most situations), we’ve been flipped off, sworn at, and just all in all made fun of for what seems to be no reason.

After dealing with this for a few days, and after seeing another broken puzzle after a group went through last night, I approached this group and called them out on it. I was not rude, and tried my hardest to not use a demeaning tone of voice, even throwing in a few jokes to make it seem like it wasn’t a lecture, but they left my lobby swearing under their breath at me and saying some extremely rude things about me and the company I work for, which I don’t feel is fair. 

I can’t quote it directly as I didn’t record myself speaking to them, but it was along the lines of-
“Hey guys! You didn’t quite make it out this time, but that’s okay. Before I walk you through the rest of the puzzles and show you how to do them, I just want to let you know that for future reference, my coworker and I are human, not robots, and we sometimes make mistakes. When we make these mistakes we really don’t appreciate being mocked or sworn at because we’re doing our best. So next time, please remember that we’re just doing our jobs and trying to help you, and remember that we can see and hear you at all time while you’re doing the escape room. Also, it seems like you broke this puzzle after we asked you specifically to be gentle with it, so let’s be a little bit more careful in the future.” 
I then proceeded to happily and normally walk them through the rest of the puzzles, take their group picture, and walk them out into the lobby. There was an awkward tension coming from them but I didn’t realize that maybe I was the asshole until they started walking out and the singular girl of the group began talking major shit and saying extremely unkind things about me and my employees. 

I’m upset because I feel like I was just doing my job and trying to make sure everyone had a good experience; employees and guests alike, and I feel like maybe I was the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	339.0	12.0	0.0	0.0
c4aok4	2019-06-23 19:57:23	fbcmfb	AITAH - I don’t want my in-laws to have a picture of my daughter.	"In-laws have an outdated mindset regarding race, religion, and women’s rights. My in-laws have never approved of our 8 marriage (13 year relationship) - in fact have provided so much stress, which would disintegrate any strong relationship. 

Here’s a short list of what they have done: (1) reported our anniversary date as a day of mourning to their temple when they found out we eloped in Hawaii. (2) blocked my wife into a parking spot and bombarded her for 30 minutes with “guilt”. (3) Her older brother physically assaulted her. (4) They threatened to kill me and said it was a Halloween (jewish) prank. (5) They would harass my wife by showing up at her place of work, a pharmacy. (6) MIL and FIL would guilt my wife by saying they are dying - but are medically fine. (7) Father-in-law has refused to talk to me when I have attempted. (8) Mother-in-law called to tell me my wife has lied to me in an attempt to create drama (9) Mother-in-law refused to be present at our daughter’s birth because I, the father, would be there. My wife and I agreed it would proper for them to be there if they wanted, but this was their answer. 

This has caused 7 years of keeping them at a distance. My wife and I have careers that have put us in a financial position to counter some of the negative things they have tried. 
Just recently our daughter and I met my wife’s grandma at the nursing home. The first thing my wife’s grandmother said was
“He is dark” in farsi, their native language. This statement bothered my wife more than it did me.

My girlfriend and I were hanging out and looking for something to watch on TV. She suggested ordering food and I said I’m not hungry but she should if she is.

Out of nowhere, she gets extremely mad and yelling at me for being indecisive. I’m super confused and call her out for yelling at me like that’s without reason.

She then breaks down and tells me she’s sorry, and that’s she just tense because she found out her grandpa had cancer and she’s worried about his life. I feel guilty and spend the next 20 minutes consoling her and talking to her about it without pushing into the details. That is until I asked what form of cancer he had.

She replied that his GP found an abnormal growth on his ear, technically a tumour, that he removed in the same visit and didn’t pose a serious threat. I’m pretty mad because I feel like she exaggerated this situation to explain her getting mad at me. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Me, my dad and my sister haven't been to see our grandparents and other family for 6 years. This year, my dads sisters and parents planned an amazing 3 week family vacation to Switzerland, just for us. My aunts and their husbands and kids are coming along, and our other cousins, and this was fine with me. 

Last night I saw that a bunch of new people are apparently coming as well. They are my cousins friends and my family doesn't know them AT ALL. So I called up my grandpa, and said 'no way am I coming, because I would feel uncomfortable going on vacation with people I don't know'. 

I think going on vacation with people who I don't know will just ruin the trip. But my grandpa and aunts will be devastated because they planned this specially for me (and my sister and dad, of course) .

She has never been a pleasant person. To use the “glass half full/empty” analogy, she’s someone who believes the glass is half empty, cracked, spilling all over the coffee table and staining the rug. It’s fucking exhausting. 

On top of her generally unpleasant demeanor and world views, other members of my dad’s side of the family seemingly only interact with each other because of her continued existence. My two aunts DESPISE each other... I’m genuinely surprised that one hasn’t murdered the other by this point. Yet they have to interact because my grandma requires constant care and their interactions are forced, cringey, and honestly what you’d expect out of two 14 year old girls fighting over a boy on the playground. My mother is constantly sucked into it and I’ve watched it cause her untold amounts of stress for the majority of my life. My mom is a good person, and doesn’t have the heart to tell her in-laws to fuck off and figure it out on their own.

My mom texted my fiancé today (we aren’t on speaking terms atm) and told her that my grandma has been moved into hospice with a constant morphine drip and that they’re expecting her to pass away any day now... and I’m honestly beyond relieved. You could even say that I’m excited. Once she’s out of the picture, no one in my dad’s family will have to pretend they can tolerate each other.

They are great kids and I think as a result of my wife and I working super hard on routine/schedule/discipline etc. We are a solid team and just getting by every day with our own unit is tiresome and challengung but rewarding because I love these little fuckers like nothing else in the world.

My wife brought along her sister's 2.5 year old son this week because his mother is 8 months pregnant and she felt bad leaving him cooped up in the house since she is too fat/lazy/pregnant (her own words) to do anything with him. Not sure why she couldnt come along on the trip (at my mother in laws beach house) but I digress. Now this kid is the spawn of a loser father who is 47 years old, already abandoned 3 kids from previous women and has been in and out of lock up his whole life. They actually met in prison.  He is excommunicated from the family due to a number of reasons so my SIL basically functioned as a single parent if not worse because the guy is a drug addict and refuses to work.

Now, for some reason, she decided to plant more of her fertilized eggs by this fucko (against his wishes) and she has twins coming. He has disappeared for the last 2 weeks (hopefully for good).  So again, this kid has been around more and more and he is a total pain in the ass.

He doesn't  talk since all his parents do is place in front of a TV. He bites and hits my sons. He can only eat mushed up food since all they feed him is pouches of baby food and he stays up til 10pm and wakes up at 9am which is the opposite of the entire houses schedule.

No one is enjoying this weekend but I can sense I am going to have this kid around more often. Don't get me wrong I love kids but it's a nightmare to take care of him and every time he is around my son it takes a few days to rid him of the bad habits he learns (biting/hiting/pushing).

I live in the Bible Belt and work at a small business in a larger city. I really enjoy work and built most of my career working in bigger businesses. Several months ago, I switched to a small business environment because I received a job offer I literally couldn't refuse: good benefits, decent raise, tuition reimbursement, interesting projects, etc. I've also got some health issues to take care of and the healthcare is pretty much paid for which helps me alot. My new coworkers are very nice people, and the company is very close-knit. Everyone knows everyone well, some of them go to church together, etc. I'm not used to it yet, but I'm cordial. They've been very welcoming. Everyone is trying to get to know me better. But there's this one issue that's holding me back from being friendly with folks. How do I put this lightly...

""I'm the only gay in the village.""

I'm not out to my coworkers or managers. The benefit of being in big companies throughout my career is no one gave two shits, and big businesses have to comply with EEO. This business is still small enough that they can skirt certain HR compliance laws. We're also in an at-will state, so I could be fired with no real reason given. Most of my management is made up of older men who present themselves in the conservative side of things, so I'm worried about them finding out.

While most of my coworkers seem very nice, I don't know if they're accepting or not yet. When they figured out I was single, a few of them offered to ""set me up"" on dates. I made the excuse that I'm not interested in dating atm. I've also lied and said I don't use social media, which makes me feel bad, but I'm afraid of people finding out somehow and letting it slip to my higher-ups. I feel like people are catching on that I'm kind of detached from the group and I worry it's making me seem rude and unapproachable.

I feel like an asshole because no one has honestly given me a reason to think they would dislike me for being gay. But I'm in the Bible Belt and we're still small enough that I could get fired. I've seen it happen. Even if I'm not fired, I could still be ostracized at work, but I don't want to change jobs.

We live together and split all bills and groceries down the middle. I clean the house and he does the cooking and we both work full time... We occasionally will take each other out to eat or cover a cost for the other if needed, but things always seem to even themselves out. Ok, so my boyfriend has been without a car since November. I have a car I’m paying off and this has been our mode of transportation. Sometimes he drops me off at work and takes the car, but most of the time, I drop him off and pick him up. He has been putting most of the gas in the car, unless we take a trip to my hometown or somewhere I pick. In April, my boyfriend lent me a large amount of money, about $700, and I’m gradually paying it down. I haven’t asked for anything but gas these last 7 months, but we have had multiple discussions about him getting a new car. He always says he can’t afford it or he likes having the extra money. I made the mistake of asking if he wanted to help me “pay down” my car loan by essentially paying down my loan with him. Instead of giving me money, he would take 25% of my car payment and put it towards the hole in his savings he lent me the money from (this money is reserved for his student loans, so he can’t use it for a car). I wanted to negotiate and talk through it, but he was instantly angry about the suggestion. I understand I waited 7 months to ask, but he never said he intended on trying to get a car for himself. He said I was trying to get out of paying him back, but it would take over a year to pay it down at the amount I suggested, so I thought I’d still have to pay at least half. I only asked because he’s not saving anything for a car and he’s not looking for any. After i suggested it, he said no because he was going to buy a car.... He’s locked himself in his room now.... how bad did I mess up?!		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I used to be in the closet sexuality-wise also, but my parents figured out that my ""best friend"" was my girlfriend and confronted me several months after we had broken up, which is why I assume they're aware that I'm not exactly religious. I'm pretty sure my parents are the only part of my family who are aware I'm not straight. We attend church every Sunday with my mother's family, who are extremely religious (my grandfather is a retired pastor, and they spent many years as missionaries in Asia).


My parents require me to attend both youth group Bible study and actual church services which comes out to 2-3 hours of church every week. During church, I am not very attentive. I stand and sit whenever I am supposed to and say the words from memory, but I sketch on the bulletins (they are changed each week and thrown away at the end of each service), and I do not typically sing the hymns, which makes my parents and grandparents very frustrated because they believe I am not paying attention, which is true. I feel that it is unfair to expect me to be interested in a religion I do not belong to, although I recognize that my parents are likely under some pressure from my grandparents. Reddit, AITA?"

c4ahgu	2019-06-23 19:46:16		WIBTA if I surrender my dog?	"My boyfriend and I adopted a German Shepard about a year and a half ago. We adopted her from a rescue with intention to make her a service dog. We were care takers on farm so I was able to be with her all day. The job position no longer became a good fit due to being taken advantage of (40+ hours a week and no pay) so we had to move and I needed to find a new job. I had intentions on bringing my service dog to work once she was trained but the dog we adopted has major shut down anxiety issues which has made making her a service dog very hard. Due to rent being very high in our area we moved in with my boyfriend's family. We currently live in a small house of 8 people and the family does not like dogs. This is a rough situation to begin with but we can live with it. We used to let my dog play outside during the day while we were at work while my boyfriend's mother was home to watch her. We found out she did not actually watch the dog causing problems for us, so now she is in a cage most of the day. My boyfriend and I work 6 days a week leaving our dog in the crate mostly. I spend my evening outside with her to try and get some energy out but it is not enough and she is starting to act out by eating things she shouldn't. This winter my dog was hit by a car (my fault, I was not watching her) she lost a leg and we are still paying off her surgery that we can't afford. We just found out two more people will be moving in and it has become too hard to live here. With our financial situation we have decided we would like to buy a small trailer and move out since it will be cheaper than rent. Unfortunatley that does not seem like a good fit for my dog. 

I do love my dog but I feel like I can no longer provide what she needs. That is why this has become a consideration. She was hit by a car under my watch, I can't afford to bring her to the vet anymore since I am still paying for her surgery and it is taking all of my money. She can't play as much because of her 3 legs and the fact that my boyfriend and I work so much.

c4ah5u	2019-06-23 19:45:48	BarneyLegh	AITA for starting to cut a parent out of my life?	"My parents got divorced when I was two, and my father remarried a couple years later. Mother got custody – so was with her in the week and dad at the weekends. Was terrified of my mother – she was incredibly emotionally distant, verbally and psychologically abusive. Weekdays were awful. 

Got to thirteen and moved down with my dad, felt free. Visits to my mother at  school holidays I dreaded and it was obvious she didn't really want me there either.   

Eventually I come to realise  she was probably deeply unhappy, she got stuck running a stately home after her father passed away just after I was born. I know now that having to run this place probably made her miserable and she took at least some of that out on me. She remarries when I'm 22 and seems much happier. 

'm 27 and we've never talked about this. When I visit which is rare I don't feel very welcome. 

For a year or two now, she's been implying that she thinks I should take this place over. Started with sending me links to relevant masters degrees just saying “It would be worth doing one of these”. Her husband gave me a weird speech when I was in the car with him about ""duty"" and having to learn to ""work within the system"" or something along those lines. She invited me to a formal meeting with members of her staff to get a sense of it - which i went to, running this place sounds awful. 

This has put the improvement in our relationship into a weird light, where I really feel that she has taken a false interest in my life as she is looking to retire. The house itself is one big unhappy memory of being scared to speak or set a foot wrong. Even now, the idea confronting her and actually dragging this shit into the open makes me (probably twice her height and weight) feel like a tiny terrified 8 year old. 

Struggle to talk to Dad's side of the family about it as they aren't aware of how bad it was, and some think this place is just a big old free money mine (it's not). 

The idea of my kids living there, and it making me into her is one of my deepest fears. 

We are not and have never been in regular contact, I have been visiting 2-3 times a year and talking maybe once every two/three months maybe. Recently I have just stopped responding as I feel so, so stuck. 

My gf and I are not so far off having kids and I just know I want her nowhere near them, but I keep hearing that bad parents can turn into amazing grandparents

AITA for basically starting to cut someone out of my life completely who has never really been in it, and eventually denying her and her husband the only grandchildren they'll ever have?

"For context, my wife and I moved closer to her side of the family more than a year ago due to available job opportunities. We both work in a relatively small niche field for short term contracts. While here, our son was born and her side of the family went baby crazy and started crossing major boundaries that my wife decided were necessary and I agreed with (We have an understanding that we deal with our own side of the family during any misunderstandings or blow ups) 

Anyway, I told my wife that the constant presence of her side of the family in our lives and their refusal to understand that we are a nuclear family was beginning to stress me out constantly. I asked her what she thought about me looking for out of state jobs after my current contract ended. My wife has done her best to give us space but she’s also tired of her side intruding in our lives. She understood and didn’t have a  problem with it, but to let her know if it got serious, so that she could give her parents advance notice that we would be moving. My FIL and MIL are very attached to our baby, more than their other grandchildren because they saw him the day he was born, and it would devastate them to know we would be leaving. 

My dilemma is that I’ve already gone on 3 second phase interviews and a serious offer may come through soon that would move my family and I to the the opposite end of the country from my in-laws. I haven’t told my wife yet because there is no concrete offer and because I really don’t want my clingy in-laws to know until the last minute. I have a feeling that if they knew ahead of time they’d try to guilt trip us into staying. I wouldn’t put it past them to try and convince my wife to stay while I relocate for work temporarily, but my wife and I are firm that we move as a family.

c4af9r	2019-06-23 19:42:51	LankyStickBitch	AITA for refusing to attend family church?	"I come from a hispanic family, religion is important. We are Catholics and they attend church nearly every Sunday. My parents often say  things such as ""be grateful that God has given you another day to live"" and ""God gave you everything you need in life"".Since I was young I have been told things like these. Now i am more grown up and unfortunately have grown to not be grateful but scared of god. I live in fear that if I say ""gods name in vain"" or even THINK something negatively about god I'll be dammed or struck down by him. I once went through a phase where I tried to become a sort of saint. I attended religious education, went to church when I could, read the bible every day, prayed constantly, considered becoming a nun to serve God, I preached to my siblings, actually beat myself up whenever I did anything of the sort that was considered sinful, and prepared for the rapture. It was ridiculous, I was a 13 YEAR OLD GIRL. I should not have been constantly worrying about whether or not I was going to enter the gates of heaven or cast to hell. Over time I came to the realization I did not do this out of love for god but out of fear. In some way I was trying to save myself from hell, from not being enough in god's eyes. I was desperate to get some confirmation that god did not hate me but loved me, so I often tried to ask for visions. Messages in dreams , signs, ANYTHING that told me that I was not a sinner going to hell. I was driven by fear and that's what kept me going to church. This year I have picked up the habit of skipping church. Many times I have been given ultimatums and have been called names for doing this. I have been told that I am the reason the family is not happy, that I am selfish for not giving time to god, that I'm a pendeja/idiot, that im a disappointment to god and a disgrace to him. I have been guilted for not going. I've been told that if i fail to attend church i will not be going anyplace during MY weekend. Fun family plans get cancelled just because I decided to stay behind, and supposedly it's all my fault that the family is unhappy. Why cancel plans over that? To some degree I can understand what they are saying, what's it going to cost me to spend an hour in gods place and give him thanks? Nothing. He has given me the gift of life and two ArMs, TWo LeGs, and a SeT oF EyEs. I have grown to resent the church, instead of feeling comfort being there I feel anger and fear. Sundays are an absolute wreck, they start in arguments. I dread sundays, absolutely dislike them. Each Sunday there is at least an hour or so of arguing. I don't get it. I dont want to go to church. Some days I have work to get done, studying to do. I'd rather do things like that than go to church. When I think church I just think of the words thrown at me by my parents, and their punishments for failing to attend. I dont associate church with warm feelings. I feel horrible saying it but it's a hell of a place to me.

But  let me explain:

So i work at a Call Center, Overnight shift. It's been about 6-7 months. At first i was very hyped and looking forwars to working here, but as days went by i realized the place is a dump.

The hygene is the worst, have to constantly bring my wipes and clean around. We don't have our own assigned desk so, its a free-for-all. And the stress levels are up to the sky.

Anyway, due to this my attendance hasn't been the best and i've already gotten two memos. Regardless of this, however, i have been recognized for Top Quality two times already. I understand that i need to be responsible with my job, and i was, but i've been dealing with depression, health issues and school at the same time plus i promised myself i would prioritize my studies, as with my last job i had done the opposite. I soend my nights before my shift just wishing i could quit, but i don't have a car and i don't know how to drive, so i pay Uber everywhere i go. So half of my paycheck is for me to move around.

Anyway, i missed work last night because i got out at 7am and went to school at 8am to 4pm, so naturally, i wasn't going home to sleep from 5-6pm to 9pm, and go to work at 10pm. I know there are people who do it, and i really admire them for that, but i lack the motivation for it.

I was planning on going to work today so i didn't miss out, but i decided to enjoy my off say and rest, because i really need it. I've been sufdering from very sharp and terrible lower back pains. I believe its due to the chairs at work. They are old, crooked, stiff and worn out. Now whenever i wake up i just have very bad pain and can barely move. Thats the main reason why i want to stay and rest.

But a co-worker told me there is little personal to cover the shift tonight, and she was advicing me i should go work atleast.

But, i want to know, would i be an asshole if i didn't go to work on my off day? I haven't reported to the supervisor that i would go in to work on my off day yet, so, i want to know your opinion before i decided if i should let him know i would go to work tonight.

But I was specifically anxious about my cousin getting flak from the other kids for wearing what's technically a girls costume. He's been bullied before for liking ""girly"" things and there was a group of boys at the party known for teasing their classmates and giving mean nicknames.

I didn't want my cousin to get harassed and for the celebration to get ruined by bullying.

Therefore when cousin came to me asking for his mermaid tail, I made up a lie on the spot about our mom forgetting to take it out of the trunk of the car when leaving to pick up the cake. As expected, the girls didn't want to wear their tails without their friend, so although he was disappointed, they all got over it pretty fast after playing on the beach with the other kids.

Also, seeing as our family was in charge of driving the cousin and his neighbor home, the two stayed for a bit longer than the other invitees while we cleaned up, so in the end they got to try out the costumes alone. Essentially, no one got hurt.

Still do you think I was the asshole for telling a white lie? Kids can be cruel and I wanted to keep the peace, but maybe my reaction wasn't the best. I'm not sure."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4ab7k	2019-06-23 19:36:23		WIBTA for telling the census lady I do not want to meet with her?	"To put this the most polite way possible, this woman has been a (polite) thorn in my side for months. My old roommates peer pressured me into doing a census survey (which is NOT mandatory) for some organization and for months now, this woman has been leaving me voice messages and texts and calling me pressuring me to follow up. We have set a time for today but I have to reschedule, I have already had to tell her to wait to schedule a couple times and I don't want to string her along. I told her I could meet today at a specific time and I can, but the truth is I am realizing I really, REALLY don't want to be a part of this (I didn't in the first place) and if she says she can't make my newly available time, I'm just thinking about politely telling her to please stop contacting me because I am choosing not to participate in this survey at all. I feel bad because she's very polite, but Reddit, WIBTA for telling her (politely) I'm not interested and to please not contact me again?

TO BE CLEAR:  If she wants to meet today and can, I'll suck it up and do it, I already feel bad for having to change the time for a legitimate reason and putting this off for so long. Also, I don't hold this against the woman, I get it's her job. But I'm really not comfortable with this and it's only becoming clear to me NOW how uncomfortable it makes me."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c4a9ap	2019-06-23 19:33:17		"AITA for wanting to lie to my parents about ""grandparents day"" at school?"	"My daughter will be starting high school next year at a k-12 school that hosts a special ""grandparents day"" near the beginning of every fall semester. It's a pretty big deal in grade school, where most of the grandparents (or other family friends) come for a coffee hour, meet the teachers, and hear the kids sing a song or two. Attendance drops off a lot in middle school, and although grandparents day technically exists in high school, no one actually comes to it. 

Problem number one is that my parents fucking love grandparents day. It is literally one of the highlights of their year. They talk about it nearly every time we seem them -- which, since they live close by, is pretty often. My daughter has become increasingly embarrassed each successive year of middle school as my parents were one of only 2 or 3 families still showing up for grandparents day. 

Problem number 2 is my parents -- and especially my dad. He is a retired aerospace engineer who is honestly kind of a jerk -- he thinks he always knows more than anyone in the room on any topic. I think the main reason he wants to come to grandparents day is so he can check out the teachers and kind of put them through their paces, especially the math and science teachers. Last year, in 8th grade, there was apparently some kind of incident where he got into an argument-slash-discussion with one of the teachers that left my daughter even more embarrassed than ever. She really, really does not want them to come to any more grandparents days. 

My dad is also someone who is kind of emotionally immature and insecure. With a normal person, you could probably sit them down and say ""hey dad, you know, grandparents day isn't really a thing with the older kids -- the school technically has it on the calendar, but they don't really do it in high school."" And a normal person would get the hint and conclude that it's time to retire from grandparents day. But there is no way this conversation is going to go well with my parents. It will probably involve elements of both ""what, you're embarrassed by your grandparents?"" and ""it's on the calendar so we're going.""  Simply telling them that their granddaughter does not want them to come is kind of the nuclear option -- it's guaranteed to trigger a huge fight and a lot of bad feelings and make my daughter the ""bad guy.""   

I am inclined to just basically lie and tell my parents that there is no grandparents day in high school. My wife is not really comfortable lying to them about it, and especially having our daughter (who is 14) involved in the lying. She also thinks it it teaching our kid that it's ok to lie in difficult situations.  I understand that lying is not morally great, but I feel like (1) it's just grandparents day and my parents should just grow up about it, and (2) it is a more pragmatic course of action that will preserve everyone's feelings and keep this from blowing up into a big fight.

c4a7gu	2019-06-23 19:30:23	Thehouseonthehill3	AITA for not telling my family I have ADHD?	"I got diagnosed after a long...long battle of figuring out what was going on with me (I'm F24). After some psych visits, I got diagnosed with ADHD and a math learning disability. It was a pretty big victory for me, I've had a very positive experience with getting the right therapy and I've made tons of progress since.

&#x200B;

I didn't tell my family about my diagnosis except for one sister, the reason being my family is among the population of people who would roll their eyes upon hearing the words ""ADHD"" and ""learning disability"". They choose to believe it's a cause of upbringing, whatever. Not getting into that. I just don't want to deal with the judgement because my family is well...very very judgemental, that's it. I told my sister because it came up in conversation and I felt it would be safe to tell her. It was an alright conversation and she was happy I told her.

&#x200B;

But I told her not to tell the rest of our family, and we got in a heated debate about it. She thinks I'm being unreasonable because they deserve to know if I'm taking certain medications and it's more-or-less ""a family concern"" and they deserve to know what significant things have happened in my life. She compared this to her depression and said it's important to be transparent so everyone will be able to help if they can and I'll have a support system. She thinks they'd have a hard time accepting it at first, but they'd come around after. I told her I disagreed because I think I would be lectured, mocked and feel embarrassed about the whole thing - which is definitely going to happen based on conversations we've had in the past. I might...MIGHT tell my mom but she is a blabbermouth and I just know my other sisters and cousins (who we are close with) will have a hay-day about it. So I just don't want to, I've had a lot of progress so far and a wonderful, supportive group of friends and I think that's more than enough.

&#x200B;

Anyway, AITA for not telling my family about this?

&#x200B;

Just a little note: If it isn't clear, I don't want to hear opinions about ADHD/learning disabilities/etc being 'real' or not 'real'. Thanks!

**Edit: Thanks for all the quick posts!! I left that convo really conflicted and thinking maybe I was being overdramatic or irresponsible or something.

c4a2hh	2019-06-23 19:22:17	kaykaloom	WIBTA for pulling my daughter out of her football team?	"My daughter Molly (13) plays football (that's English football/soccer btw) for a team and they train every sunday. She has been playing for years but has only been with this team for a few months. Molly loves football and is very talented and her coach Chelsey is very pleased with her. 

However, on the team there are a group of five girls who don't like Molly. They all go to the same school and their parents all know each other, and as often happens with teenage girls it gets quite clique-y and territorial. This group see themselves as the ''real'' team and pretty much only work with each other during matches and don't support anyone who isn't in their group. Molly has been told by this group that she isn't welcome. The worst of them is a girl called Amy. A talented player but really dislikes Molly for some reason. She has made Molly cry before and has only gotten worse after being told by Chelsey to tone the mean girl stuff down. 

Today was a big match, and Molly scored what turned out to be the winning goal. What should have been a happy day turned bad when Molly came out of the locker room in tears saying that Amy and her friends had hidden her stuff, and that Amy had told her she was useless and only on the team because Chelsey felt sorry for her. Chelsey found the stuff, and had a word with Amy and her mum, saying that anymore bullying would result in her being kicked off the team. 

This made Amy cry and Amy's mum then had a go at me, saying Molly needs to grow up and accept what she calls typical girls ''teasing'' each other. I know the difference between teasing and bullying and as an adult she should too. 

The thing is that if Amy gets kicked out, her gang of bullies will still be there, and I can't imagine it would be much fun for Molly if it was there. Chelsey has said that she'd be willing to kick out Molly's group as well if they cause trouble, as there are enough girls trying to get a place on the team to replace them. But I feel like that would cause problems down the line especially with the other parents. 

Molly spent most of the day crying and due to that I am thinking of pulling her out of the team. She loves football and is good at it but if she's leaving something that she's supposed to be having fun in tears then we have a problem. We can find her another team since there are loads out there. 

The only problem is that I feel like if I pull her out she may come out feeling like she was the problem and that's she's being punished even though she's the victim, especially since Chelsey is willing to deal with the bullies once and for all so it feels like we are letting them and their parents win. Molly does have friends on the team and would miss them if she's made to leave by me."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c49yof	2019-06-23 19:16:09	TikisFury	AITA for not going and helping out my SIL?	"So my SIL within the last six months started a small childcare business. They’ve been successful and have grown enough to be able to afford to put in a playground at their “school.” She’s asked a few people to come help put in the playground, self included. I however really don’t want to go help, and I’ll tell you why. 

1. I’m sick. I’ve been sick all week and I haven’t been able to shake it. Meds, sleeping, water, going on walks, whatever, I have tried to get this cold to fuck off and it’s still just hanging on. I don’t feel good and I don’t think going and doing manual labor is going to make me feel any better. 

2. She has a habit of making a mole hill out of a mountain. She has asked me for “small” favors before and I’ve obliged only to be greeted by a WAY bigger job than I agreed to help with. In the 6 years I’ve known her she’s moved twice and I’ve helped with those moves under the pretense of “everything is all packed up and it just needs to be hauled out to the moving trucks.” Then when I show up not only is everything NOT packed up but it’s also in no way prepped to move. So instead of a few hours of moving stuff it’s been an entire days worth of packing, cleaning, loading and unloading. 

3. I just don’t want to. I’m not particularly interested in donating a day of my weekend to go bust ass for free setting up a playground when instead I could be doing things I’d rather do. 

I just have a terrible time saying no to people. And if I tell Her no I’ll feel awful. AND if my wife finds out that I told her no she’ll almost certainly tell Me that I should have gone and helped.

Edit: she asked on Friday if I could help this weekend. I told her for sure that I couldn’t on Saturday and that I would see how I felt on Sunday, but no promises."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1610.0	143.0	0.0	0.0

c49wtb	2019-06-23 19:13:08	Softkittywarmkitty77	AITA for not wanting to move back to my hometown where I can't find too many jobs in my field?	"As a background, I am a 22F and a Computer Science student in the last year of college, I did an internship but I'm not working currently because I wanted to finish my thesis properly before that and start looking for work in autumn after spending the last summer holiday at my parent's home. I study in another town, not in my hometown. 

&#x200B;

My dad just called me saying that I can get a job in my field in my hometown, at the same 'company' he works for. He talked with someone from HR that said I could get a job easily since they really need people there. But that would mean for me to move back in my hometown to live with my parents for at least a couple of years more and work on a way lower wage there. It's also the only place I could work at, in fact I'm not even sure that it is actually anything computer science related or just something like an office worker that does everything, basically like a secretary. As much as I'd like to move back in my hometown I wouldn't really be interested in working only in the same place for the rest of my life (assuming the company doesn't go bankrupt or just move away). Literally the only jobs that are in that town are as sellers and other 'unskilled worker' jobs, everyone that goes to college doesn't go back there. They either get a job in the city they've finished their college in or they move away to another country. 

&#x200B;

Like I get it, he would probably like to see me more often, since I won't be able to go back home too often if I work here and they can't come visit me that much either because of work, that's the only reason I feel bad. If it wasn't for this I would not even think a minute about accepting that offer if I can get a better paid job with more benefits.

&#x200B;

So, am I an asshole for telling my dad that as much as I'd love to go back there, I'd actually like to live better and try new things instead of going back to a place where I would be jobless unless I move away if that company closes?"	No A-holes here	0	0	671.0	80.0	0.0	0.0

She completely shatters my confidence, ridicules me and uses my weak points against me (she knows my weak points and sensitive issues because I used to resort to her when I had no one and that is one of the biggest mistakes I’ve done). She’d constantly make disgusting remarks at me because to her I’m an irresponsible wh—e because I sometimes end up in trouble involving (disgusting) guys (things I haven’t even done I didn’t deliberately ask them to be this way towards me or to do these things to me so I don’t understand why she insist I’m this way).

Recently in the past 3 years I reconnected with a girl I went to high school with. We were partially close as she lived near me and we always took the same bus home. After high school a lot of my ""friends"" kind of faded out of existence. So I was in the position where I had no friends for a long time. To be frank I missed it. I ended up getting enough money to move out of my parents house and was selling some extra things I had to make the move easier. The girl ended up contacting me and was interested in some paintings I made and a ring I was selling. We met up and I ended up giving them away for free. Basically I gave her a ring worth $80 and 5 paintings I made myself that I was selling for $10. We ended up staying in contact on and off I found out her mom and dad died of cancer. So of course I felt sympathy for her. She was like 21 at that time and some time after found out she was pregnant. She didn't really have anyone helping her so I tried my best to be there. But in that time I ended up getting fired from my job and had to live off savings. Then my appendix burst and I was drowning in medical debt and couldn't afford to pay my bills and rent. The girl contacted me begging me to pay for her cell phone bill. I declined because I really couldn't do that. She had her baby and asked me to watch her multiples times which I did while declining any kind of payment. I just wanted her to save her money and be able to provide for the baby. After a while I bought her a couple baby outfits. But it seemed like on top of all the things I was doing she just wanted more and more from me. She got a job while I was still unemployed and would beg me tp buy her food. The last straw was when she contacted me (after not calling me for months) to ask if she could use my hulu. Saying that ""$7/month was tol expensive"" Last week she tried calling and texting me saying she's pregnant again and wants me to come to her baby shower. And I haven't replied. I feel used and like this girl is not a good friend. But am I the asshole here?


TLDR; girl I was friends with got many free things from me out of kindness. But she still begged and asked for more from me. She's pregnant again and wants me to come to her baby shower but I've been ghosting her. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	1454.0	92.0	0.0	0.0

So I want to preface with the fact that I am not a picky person and not uptight about the service I get and neither is my family. We were coming back home from vacation and decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for a quick meal. 

We got sat down fairly quickly and waited for 15 minutes. Nobody had come to greet us so we called over a waiter and asked what was up. She said she’d get someone over right away. No worries, we were in no rush, we were having a good time. We wait another 10 and finally someone comes to take our order. My father, mother, and brother all order alcoholic drinks; everyone else gets water. The drinks take awhile to come too, but whatever. So, at this point we’ve waited over 30 minutes and haven’t gotten our orders in. 

At roughly the 35 minute mark we have to flag down our waiter and ask to take our orders for food (it wasn’t that busy, 75% full house would be my guess). Hallelujah we are hungry and about to gorge on some tasty ass wings. Wrong. We wait 45 minutes. Nothing. We flag down our waiter again and ask whatsup with our food. He says he’ll go check on it. ANOTHER 15 minutes he comes back and says for some reason our order never got put in and it is now in. At this point we’ve become annoyed, my dad has a really short temper and is visibly angry. However, my family combats this by making light out of any and all situations, we’re used to it. 

So, at this point we have been at Buffalo Wild Wings for around an hour and a half (all these times are guesses but pretty close because we started counting). Now, we expect since our waiter messed up our order that he would put it to the front of the line and rush our order. Wrong. We reach the hour 50 mark and now ask for the manager. 

The manager says the food will be right out in the next five. We say ok. We wait five. No food. We wait a few more minutes. No food. The waiter obviously sucks as you can tell at this point and never asked us for refills so in total we got three drinks for the table. 

My dad starts going on a tirade about how BWW sucks and people are looking. The rest of us are fed up too and everyone is hangry. We decide we are going to leave without paying. So, essentially we stole three drinks but got the worst service in the history of food ever. We go over to the next door restaurant which is a nice steakhouse. We were in and out in an hour and twenty minutes and it was delicious.

We believe that this is compensation for our two hours of lost time and the most egregious service we will ever experience. This is Buffalo Wild Wings where at lunch you get wings for free if they aren’t out in 15 minutes.

c49p78	2019-06-23 19:00:57	DankMemes-Sama	WIBTA if I don't invite a group chats member girlfriend to a private friend chat group?	"I know this is kind of petty in a way, but just wanted to hear an outside opinion.

Me and a bunch of friends were once part of a large friend group on WhatsApp. Quite often things turned dramatic and toxic over there, so after a while I just had enough and quit. Because I still wanted to keep in touch/send memes to people I got along with, I decided to create my own group and add some of the people that were previously part of that group, essentially a refugee camp for people who also wanted to escape that group and just casually meme.

Early on I layed down some basic rules:
1) it has to be relatively small - the previous group had 35+ members, a lot of who were friends of friends who were randomly added. There were times when Thanos snap was used - 50% (actually 20-30%,i just wanted a Thanos reference) of people were removed from the group, because either admins were salty and deleted unfavourable people to them or people just were inactive. I didn't want the hastle, so decided on keeping the group small.
2) I didn't want random people to be added. My logic - if everybody adds random people, things get out of control quickly (ex. someone adds someone they don't like, so drama ensues),so I decided to be the moderator - if I don't really know them and they aren't part of the groups friend circle, not gonna invite them.

Problem now occurred that one of the members wants his girlfriend added to the chat. Another member also keeps in a way pressuring me to add her. I do know that person, but honestly not well enough (only seen her a few times and haven't had a conversation that lasted more than 5 minutes with her) + she doesn't hang out with our group all that often (at least I haven't seen her all that often and I hang out with my group on regular basis).

So the question is - WIBTA if I don't invite her? It's not like it's that big of a deal, but I just want to establish a boundary, because otherwise we could have the same discussion next week about someone else. I already explained my reasons as to why I don't want to add her, but they just think I'm salty and unreasonable, so want to hear what you guys think

Edited: The other friend is asking to add her because he thinks she would be a good addition based on his interactions with her. They both know each other for a while. Likely scenario would be that if I gave a solid no to the invite the friend with gf would leave, but we're not that close, so I wouldn't cry over it, just don't want more drama, since that was one of the main reasons I left the old chat. Also the other friend is a close friend of mine - asked him to be my best man. Just don't want any bad blood, since he is basically a brother from another mother to the guy with gf"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c49nyl	2019-06-23 18:59:05		AITA for blowing off my friend after they didn’t come to my wedding celebration?	"A few yrs ago, my partner & I essentially eloped.  Traditional weddings aren’t our style. And factoring in recent family drama & finances, we went abt strategizing how to get married in a way that included people we love but was low key. One of the biggest factors to me was being able to celebrate with my closest friends, several of whom lived far away. Bc of this, we chose to get engaged secretly & have a small ceremony with only our parents & siblings. We sent an email blast the day of essentially saying we’re hitched/stay tuned for details on a larger celebration a few months away (to give our far-away friends time to travel affordably if they wanted to come). 

Ann has been one of my life long best friends. She now lives abroad with her husband, who has a very similar job to my husband’s job (an important detail for later). I was a bridesmaid in her wedding for which I bought a dress, went on her bachelorette party, traveled to her wedding & got her a very nice gift. I loved getting to be there for her big day. Several times over her wedding weekend, she brought up how “effed up” it was that the man of honor’s wife did not fly in for the wedding and literally made the comment that it was “only an extra $1000 and so selfish can’t they just budget, etc”. It stuck in my memory bc I remember thinking it was ridiculous.

Ann coincidentally was in town the week after we married & told me over drinks that she may not be able to come to our party. She reached out a few weeks later to confirm w a long guilt-ridden apology explaining they were tight on finances, etc. She then asked for our address to send a gift, which we never got. Her apology annoyed me bc it felt less abt my feelings & more abt relieving her guilt. I wish she hadn’t brought up finances bc while I empathize, our husbands do very well & at a point, it’s a matter of priority. I can respect that decision, but I also don’t want to hear that voice in the back of my head when she posts luxurious vacation photos. 

I haven’t brought it up since bc honestly there’s nothing she can do. I’ve seen and hung out w her since. I still really enjoy & miss her. But I’ve definitely been more distant. This week, she was in town for the funeral of another friends immediate family member (a friend who she gripes to me abt every time I see her). She texted me to get together. I know a death is a big deal & happens arguably less often than a wedding, but it still hit a nerve that she could somehow manage this for another friend. I blew her off for a few days and then told her my schedule was packed (which is true) but I’d try. AITA for not being up front with her and instead blowing her off to create distance? 

TLDR: my best friend didn’t come to my wedding celebration after I had been in/spent lots of time & money on her wedding. I’ve been (mildly) distant ever since, peaking recently when I blew her off when she was in town for the funeral of another friends family member."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c49lmw	2019-06-23 18:55:29		AITA for saying a sarcastic joke to my friend?	"One of my good friends recently transferred to a new school and is nervous about starting and meeting new people. I’ve been supportive and comforting him for a while, and I have always made it clear that I want the best for him and for him to be successful in everything that he does. Well, last weekend he was going to hangout with our group but instead went out with some of his new friends to get to know them better. I made a sarcastic joke saying “oh look you have other friends, you think you’re so much better than us now huh”. It was supposed to be completely sarcastic, but he got really offended and he didn’t like that I made that comment. As soon as I found out he was offended, I apologized and said I didn’t meant it with any bad intent it was just a stupid joke with no truth to it. We didn’t talk for a day but then he messaged me saying everything was ok. We proceeded to continue talking as if nothing ever happened, everything was normal. There was nothing at all that indicated he was still upset.

Flash forward to this weekend. I invited him to come out with us because I knew he would be in town. He agreed. We went bar hopping, and at the first bar I texted him to see where he was at. He ignored my texts while he was answering one our mutual friend’s texts that was with me. I didn’t think much of it at first, and didn’t see him at the first bar. Then we go to the second bar, which was smaller, and I tried calling him. He picked up, and before I could say hi he hung up. Finally, when we got to the second bar I saw him and I tried saying hi. He was pretty intoxicated, but he looked at me and gave me a nasty look. He didn’t say anything and ignored me the entire night. I was pretty shocked and confused because I didn’t understand what I did wrong, but I just left him alone and tried not to let it ruin my night. The next day I messaged him asking him why he acted like that last night, and he told me he was still upset over the comment I made last week. We got into a big argument, because I told him I didn’t think it was right for him to treat me the way he did, and that I wish he would’ve just told me he still felt some type of way about the comment instead of acting like everything was fine and then completely ignoring me. The argument got pretty bad and it might even end our friendship. AITA for acting how I did?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c49knw	2019-06-23 18:53:56		AITA for thinking birthdays are stupid?	"Birthdays are narcissistic events and a waste of time.
Let me explain. I know people feel really special on their birthdays and want to celebrate, but all I can think is why? What have you done? If anything, send some flowers to the person who pushed you out of her vagina. Beside the cases in which you have people who have dedicated most of their lives and efforts to giving back to their community and making a difference, how did we come to believe that we deserve to spend a whole day focused on ourselves and making others feel guilty if they don’t celebrate and spend money on us? Idk. I don’t really have issue with celebrating birthdays of the elderly since generally it is out of respect for the long life they have lived during which we assume they have contributed much to the generations before them. I’m just so disillusioned with this whole hype that people get into where if they don’t get a big birthday blowout, it’s the end of the world and they feel like they missed out on something they deserved. You know what I guess ITA for even thinking this.

Look, I’m not going to tell you what you can or can’t say. That isn’t my job. I think that all the conflict going on has influenced society to become a rigid liberal vs. conservative place. People can’t really disagree without hostility and that’s a toxic thing. I think that I’ve definitely been very staunch in my pro-LGBTQIA+ views and promoted that standard of not being able to conduct a healthy conversation where we could share our opposing views. I apologize for that.My support for the LBTQ+ community comes from a place of love. When people are different, we alienate them for being who they are. It’s so much easier to throw people who are different off to the side and not accept them than try to understand them. I’ve known how it feels to be different than everyone else- and not in a good way. It hurts a lot. Ostracization from the rest of society is never a good feeling. Instead of throwing different people off to the side, everyone has the choice to be proactive and stand up against the hate. I make the choice to stand up especially when I know that I’m the only person that feels the way I feel.When people say hateful things against beautiful people it honestly hurts me so much. It makes me so angry and so sad. People in the pride community don’t choose to feel the way the feel. They’re born loving the people they love and feeling the way they feel. In some countries it’s punishable by death to be gay. Conversion therapy is still very much a thing. So many gays lose their families over their sexual orientation- something so small that they can’t change. They get beat up, called names, lose opportunities and have their lives taken for being themselves.I know that you think it’s cool to call things and people gay but it isn’t cool to all the gays who are getting hurt for how they feel. People only use “that’s so gay” to describe bad things. Over time those words become ideas and those ideas become real actions (beating gay people up, conversion therapy, laws against pride). They created an environment of accepted, internalized homophobia.You don’t need to apologize if you don’t mean it. I know that no matter what I say, you’re going to keep negatively referencing gays, threatening them and negatively referencing mental illnesses but that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop standing up against it. I will stop trying to immediately villainize you for your views and I will do my best to listen to your side of the argument."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

But last night, me and a few buddies went out for drinks at a bar. I ordered a pitcher of beer and three mixed drinks. When I get the check, it's $40. I tipped $4. My rationale was that the service only consisted of bringing over the beverages to the table, and so tipping 20% on an easy order that was already quite pricey did not seem necessary, and I thought $4 seemed fair.


The waitress actually came back to our table and literally yelled at me for having not left a better tip. After she left, my friends said they thought that was a pretty low tip, but that she definitely shouldn't have done that.

One of the girls recently moved to my city and hit me up. She is in a very awkward living situation w her roommate: they hooked up and she didn’t know how to feel about it. 

We hung out once before w a few friends of mine. I wanted to make her feel like she had a new home here bc it sounded like she moved here in haste, out of an other bad situation. Last night she invited me to a get together at her place w her friends from her hometown. 

Upon meeting the roommate, we share maybe one significant interaction that I recall. Talked about where he gets his weed from in town. Shared a chair during King’s Cup (and there was no funny business there, literally perched on opposite corners of the chair since we were short on seats.) 

Later on in the night during beer pong, my new “friend” tells me she still has feelings for him but she thinks he’s into me. She asked me (told me really) not to go after him, to which I responded “I’m not going to - that’s all you.”  I really didn’t even know the guy’s name, and I wasn’t interested in sabotaging this new friendship by sleeping w her love interest/roommate. 

Long story short, she didn’t believe me. We were both cross-faded but toward the end of BP she ran to her friends and started expressing to them her feelings about me and her roommate. Idk if it was the weed or the liquor, but suddenly the atmosphere felt hostile. She let me know that people were wrapping it up, and I dipped out to meet up w a couple other friends. I was confused at first but I took the hint and got out of that situation. 

After leaving, she texts me: “thanks for coming! Are you texting (roommate’s name) i think he’s into you” 

Like??  Girl... I shut that shit down by saying “Nope we didn’t exchange contact info.” The truth.

Background Info: My church holds a sort of Youth Sunday School in the churches gym. The gym is very echoey. Today there was a girl I didn’t recognize her (Which is normal as people invite friends and I wasn’t there last week as I was on vacation). This is where it starts.

I assumed this girl (Who we’ll call Emily) was on the lower end of the spectrum or had ADHD respectfully.

She was tapping her foot snapping  and singing songs and quoting movies as well as playing on her phone at full volume which echoed throughout the gym. Today’s topic though was more serious than others as usually Youth group is more lighthearted. 

She then halfway through started sing a more colorful part of the song “X gonna give it to ya”. I (And pretty much everyone there were shocked but decided to hold our tongues. She was quickly quieted down by a youth leader but everyone was still shocked at what happened. 

When I ended the lesson in prayer she started playing leap day (A game for mobile devices) which event though is an excellent game has a very loud and retro soundtrack which was another thing that bugged me.

Even though I didn’t say or do anything I was livid.

After youth group I told a good friend of mine what I thought which he called me an asshole as we should be sympathetic to her due to her condition. I told another friend of mine (Who has ADHD) and he said I’m not the asshole.

c49636	2019-06-23 18:30:47	UncleBobLoblaw	AITA for checking on my elderly neighbor?	"I live in an apartment building with my girlfriend and I have a neighbor across the hall that I'm friendly with.  

I dont really know her that well but we do say hi when we see each other.
One thing I do know about her is that she has a son (late 40's?) and a granddaughter (14?) who seems very intelligent just based off having small conversations with her when she sees me with my dog.
The son, however, has given me and my girlfriend weird vibes.  I've never spoken to him but I did hear him tell his mom to shut the fuck up one time.

Anyways, here's what happened last night.  It was around 11 pm and I heard a bunch of loud bangs.  Like heavy enough that it woke my gf up.  No sound came after so I chalked it up to someone falling in their apartment.
5 minutes later I hear another big bang and a quick scream.  I go outside in the hallway to listen and I hear nothing so I walk up to the level above and listen and nothing.  All of a sudden some arguing starts up from somewhere on my floor so I go down to my floor and listen and  I hear another loud bang and I hear my neighbor telling someone to please calm down.
I didnt even think and I knocked on her door.  She answers hiding behind the door and I asked if she was ok and she said yes but it seemed odd. All of a sudden the son comes running to the door laughing saying everything is ok blah blah but I didnt buy it and I cut him off without even looking at him and asked her again "" are you sure you're ok?"" And she said yes once again.
Now I'm in just my boxers, I'm a big guy (6'3, 240 lbs) and I have a lot of tattoos on my arms and torso so I was TRYING to be as intimidating as possible when I looked her in the eyes and said "" if you have any problems, I'm here"" and then I went back to my apartment.

So at this point, I pretty much assume this guy has/is abusing his mom or granddaughter.
Fast forward to today and my neighbor knocked on my door to explain that her son and granddaughter were playing fighting etc and the story makes complete sense   I apologize for being nosey and she said thank you for being a good neighbor.

So, I'm a classic worry wart so I'm now stressing out because I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world for just assuming and labeling this guy has an abuser but my neighbor and girlfriend think I did the right thing.

c495io	2019-06-23 18:29:51	Aitathrowaway333333	AITA if I tend to schedule workmen to the house when my wife is home alone?	"Throwaway since she is pretty active on Reddit.
As the title says, we’ve had some stuff go wrong with the house lately, plumbing, gas and central heating stuff. Whenever I get someone to come and fix it, I tend to do it when my wife is home, often it turns out she’s home alone. At first she used to say (we’ve been married 10 years) that she’s not comfortable with this, but now she just looks resigned, I suppose? I feel like she’s just being a little dramatic and just doesn’t want to have to deal with it, to be honest.

The thing is, we both do shift work and she’s on permanent early turn, so she’s always home before 1400, so it’s just easier to schedule afternoon appointments rather that look at my shifts to find out if I’m on or not.
So, AITA?

Edit: So it looks like I am the asshole, I’ll have a talk with my wife and apologise. I honestly thought that she was overdramatising because she’s had some abuse issues from her childhood that makes her nervous of strangers and I thought that this may have been colouring her idea of the world and making it seem more threatening to her than it actually is. This has opened my eyes, if I’m brutally honest and I owe my wife a pretty huge apology."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c4959a	2019-06-23 18:29:28	Slim_Bone	AITA For Not Helping Some Guy After His Kayak Capsized?	"Yesterday I tagged along with my friend on his company's kayak outing. Now my friend recently moved back home from Arizona, so some of his coworkers on this trip even he did not really know yet, so after meeting all of these people for the first time we set out on our way.

The entire five mile river journey was beautiful, serene, and quite peaceful. I ended up splitting up with my friend and was at the front of the pack with a few others, one of whom we shall call Abe for the sake of this story. Abe and I were really enjoying ourselves the entire day while partaking in casual chit-chat. By the end of the river we had finally reached a clearing that encompassed a small pond which was essentially in someone's backyard.

Now in this pond there was a tiny, and I mean SMALL waterfall. This thing couldn't have been bigger than two feet. Besides the waterfall it was a still, calm pond. So I, sitting in my kayak, took out my bag and proceeded to roll a j because I figured what better chance/place than here?

In the midst of my scrolling, I glance up, and I see Abe's head barely above the water just treading frantically; I look a little further beyond him and see his kayak rolling in the fury of the mini falls. This kid somehow managed to drift directly into the waterfall and has been capsized and cannot get his kayak back.

So, mind you, my hands were literally full, so I called out for help from a couple of the other guys who were nearby with us. They proceeded to get his kayak out of the waterfall while he swam over to shore, all the while I finished rolling and toasted my little j to myself. The entire ordeal was really pretty hysterical, especially considering the water was barely a few feet deep so Abe was in no real danger.

Afterwards, the rescuers abandoned us, but I remained behind and helped him get his kayak onto shore to dump the water out and I waited to paddle back in with him. Besides losing his phone and sunglasses, he was a pretty good sport about the whole situation, but I was definitely beside myself with laughter. Everything ended up being fine, but I felt a little bad afterwards for not really offering any true assistance.

TL;DR: Some kid's kayak capsized underneath a mini waterfall but I was too busy rolling a j to help him, but he was fine."	Asshole	0	0	115.0	15.0	0.0	0.0
c494vv	2019-06-23 18:28:52	stro3ngest1	WIBTA to start hounding my ex for my things back?	"Long story short...Me and my ex broke up (duh). We were long distance. So it’s not a matter of taking a bus to his house to grab them, it’s a 5 hour plane ride on a direct flight. That being said...It’s not hard to mail back a hoodie, jacket and septum jewelry. He wants a skateboard and some clothes back. 

I have everything packed up and ready to send off to him but I’m hesitant to mail it before getting confirmation because I know he has a huge problem following through on literally anything. 

I’ve asked him to send my things back and he says he will. I waited 2 weeks and heard nothing, so I texted his mom. She’s an absolute gem, still checks up on me and catches up with me. That being said...she also has a problem of following through. She said she would and it’s been another 2 weeks. Hopefully, they mail it soon but i’m starting to doubt it.

I was given the opportunity to visit a large city that’s about a half hour away from him this August.  Would I be the asshole to text his mother asking her to get the things ready and show up to grab them, if they don’t mail them?

Side note: the things I want are not for petty reasons, one is a coat that belonged to my now dead grandfather, the septum jewelry is a combined $200 and the hoodie was given to me by a dear friend and I mistakenly left it there. I’m a very sentimental person and truthfully, I want them back.

I got angry back and told her I DID in fact have enough to order pizza (obviously how i bought the pizza in the first place or my card would've been declined) and that tips are supposed to be optional anyways so he was entitled for expecting more.

c48ycs	2019-06-23 18:18:24	neoKushan	AITA for asking a couple to move seats at the cinema?	"Okay so this happened today and I still feel bad about it.

My gf and I decided to go see Brightburn this afternoon. At my local cinema that have a ""gallery"" section that has nicer seats and free popcorn and drinks. Due to a discount I get, I tend to go here and always book tickets in advance so I can pick what seats I get (the gallery is the very back of the cinema but different screens have slightly different layouts, meaning sometimes the ""end"" seat is directly in the middle of the screen).

Anyway I picked some great seats - at the end of the row, but knowing the layout I knew they would be centre screen and perfect.

Unfortunately we were a little bit late to the cinema, getting there just as the film had started. When we got into the screen, there was a couple in our seats.

This happens occasionally and I don't mind, but hey I had the tickets for these seats so I asked them politely to move. The lady rolled her eyes at me and the guy started packing up all their stuff to move to the next seats. She just sat there the whole time looking annoyed. 

I felt a little bit guilty, but not so much - all these seats are allocated for a reason and these were my seats after all. I thought her attitude was a bit shitty, but it happens.

However, the guy then picked the lady up to move her to her new seat. It was only at this exact moment I realised that she was, in fact, disabled. 

Now that this has dawned on me, I realised that the wheelchair I walked past on the way into the screen must have been hers.

I missed the first 10minutes of the film because I felt so bad and so guilty.

c48y0z	2019-06-23 18:17:49	ladydragonness	AITA for not rescheduling my ophthalmologist appointment so my wife can come?	"Allright, this needs a bit of context so I can properly explain my feelings properly. I had 6 concussions over the course of two years and a lot changed about myself. I became more quick to anger, I lost a lot of my language skills, my memory retention dropped significantly, I lost a lot of small movement coordination in my hands, and my vision went from amazing to somewhat bad.

Therefore, when I have an appointment where I need to go get my vision checked, because it's gotten worse again, and I need new glasses. It's like a regular doctors appointment to me. I'll spend 5 minutes top looking at the glasses. It not fun for me at all because it reminds me of everything I've lost. I feel like shit the rest of the day. And no matter what pair of glasses I choose, I will always hate them : they're a constant reminder of what I lost from my concussions.

I have an appointment set Tuesday morning but my wife has to work. She really wants to come and is upset with me for not scheduling my appointment for when she gets off. My wife is upset because she's going to miss out on the fun. As she has expressed to me, everyone hates wearing glasses, they just make the choosing which glasses the fun part to override the miserable part. She says she wants to come have fun with me and it's not fair I'm taking that away from her. My wife has also expressed that being married means doing things together, so we should do this together too. She wants me to call tomorrow and reschedule. 

I feel bad for upsetting her. And I understand her point of view. But I just want to go and get it done with. I don't want to spend a half hour trying on a ton of pairs like she wants (and did for hers). I just want to go, pick out a pair that goes well with everything I could wear and my face (which before now has taken 5 minutes) and leave.

I feel really guilty and a lot of pressure to switch my appointment and do what she wants anyway, but I know that's only going to make my day worse.

My Brothers work requires that he has  to travel around the northern part of the country.
His wife called me last week and told me that he was coming to my town and asked me if I know any cheap sleeping place nearby for that week.
That got me wondering a little that why doesnt my brother or wife  ask from me directly if he can come sleep to my apartment for that week. 
So I said that he is welcome to stay at my apartment since I was going away anyway. 
Well the week passed and everything was fine until today. I returned at my apartment and noticed that few of my brothers stuff were still around and the door wasnt properly locked. 
I thought he left in a hurry and that I must get his stuff back to him someday. 

Later I started to wonder that he needs some of that stuff everyday so is he coming for another week?
I sent him and his wife a text and asked about it. 
My brother didnt answer but his wife did and told that he is coming. 
That got me angry and I asked her why no one bothered to ask me if its okay. 
She said that I shouldnt have promised that he is welcome to stay. That got me so angry since she was twisting my words and I just told him that a)Im angry right now to them b) I like my privacy and this feels like you dont care what I think or feel. c) I pointed out that I promised only one week and no one asked me about more. 
I tried to cool down after that but it didnt work so well.
Finally the wife apologized for not asking but my brother didnt writeback.
Wife also said that if its not okay for me my brother can find another place to sleep.
I was still angry of how they treated me so I told almost immediately yes and went for a long walk to cool down. 
As I was walking my brother finally answered with a long text. In a short version  the text was something like: what is my problem? I'm mentally unstable and that I should go get help and that I have no guts or balls to talk with him. I should grow UP
I told him that he can get his stuff and leave the spare key at the table. 
He kept insulting me so I just replied ok to his last text and left it there.
I live in a small apartment and I just felt that he doesnt respect my privacy or personal space at all.
But still I'm wondering..Am I the asshole?

"I should mention that I have a history of cuncussions, and currently still have pretty bad vertigo along with other post concussion symptoms. If I stand up for too long I get light headed, so I subsequently sit when working with lots of items. However standing up and sitting down too fast or too much makes me get tunnel vision, or pass out sometimes.

Store layout:
25'x35' room. 2 large showcases taking up middle of room. Around the perimeter of the store there is a counter. 

We Work in a cramped area, however there is multiple belts to seperate behind the counter and the customer area for easy staff acsess to other areas. I was sitting 10 or so feet to the left of a store use computer which is at the bottom right of the store, and about 1 foot away from me on my left was a belt. In front and to the right of the computer there is a belt, this is about 4 feet from the computer. As well as a number m others to move around during rushes.
 
Now I was sitting down on a chair and bagging small items. When my cowroker started doing inventories, this required walking around the entire store. Insteead of b-lining to the item she had to check my coworker (Jane) would walk around the perimeter forcing me to stand up then sit down. Jane would then return to the computer quickly, making me stand up and sit down, then return down the same path making me stand up and sit down. 

After about 2 hours of this I could barely see the items I was bagging. So I chose to stop standing up. All of my coworkers know about my post concussion issues, I am told to take it slow and make sure I do a good job. so I assumed she would also know. However apperantly this made her mad. I dont know why I did my best to get out her way.

Long story short for the other factors, I politely asked for respect after she yelled at me infront of customers. After asking for respect as I have always given her respect, she said 'dont talk to me for the rest of the night""

c48jmv	2019-06-23 17:54:42	throw_away7790	AITA for asking my boyfriend to stop talking to one of my good friends?	"I will probably be the asshole in this situation. I’ll refer to the friend as J. When I say ‘see them messaging’, I do not snoop on their phones, they are casually messaging in front of me.

BF and I started dating around 8 months ago. I have a rule/boundary for any relationship that I do not want my boyfriend to talk to any of my close friends. I have read too many (potentially fake) stories on Reddit/social media about ‘boyfriend was cheating with sister/best friend’ and REALLY want to keep this from ever happening because the betrayal would kill me. I do want my friends and BF to be acquainted and on good terms, but I do not want them to start talking privately just because we are dating. Basically a ‘prevention is better than cure’ mentality fuelled by insecurity and ‘contingency planning’ lol. I have explained this to him before, and while I definitely understand it’s childish/insecure/controlling, I’m working on it but it’s not something I can get over anytime soon.

BF and J talked a littler earlier than BF and I, prior to when we started dating. Their conversations consist of sticker/word spamming and occasional questions from J about her new hobby which BF is more well versed in. J is objectively more attractive than I am, and I have asked BF why he wasn’t interested in her (because he asked which of his friends I would have considered as a boyfriend) and he said, ‘mainly because [mutual friend] is into her, I thought she was pretty but I guess you’re more my type.’

I would only get annoyed if I actually saw him messaging her, and after the first three times of asking him stop, I would fully go off at him about how he can’t even live up to my one rule (regretfully, very mean and condescending) and that he’s basically choosing their ‘worthless’ conversations over me. He does not reply to a lot of people, but chooses to continue the spamming her specifically. 

BF has said that he does not really value their relationship and does not get anything out of talking to her. When I ask why he just doesn’t stop talking to her, he says ‘dunno’. Every time, he has said that he’s sorry and will stop, but he hasn’t and at one point talked to her daily (actual conversation talk) and their conversations seemed more meaningful/proper than the ones we shared, as he usually only messages me ‘what u up to’, and replies ‘nothing much’ if I ask.

I have briefly talked to J about this when I saw her spamming him one time, and she said she ‘only talks to him because of me’.

I do not tell him to stop talking to other girls, with the exception of my close friends who he did not know prior to us dating (apart from J) and do not place any other restrictions on him whatsoever.

For some context: I’ve been a mix of mental health issues since I was pretty young. Problems I didn’t end up starting the process of getting help for until I was 18 (I’m 20 now).
I had always hid the depression. I I believed i did a pretty good job at it, because no one ever seemed to notice. But about a year ago, after I had got out of a stay at a mental hospital, my sister said to me something along the lines of “you were always like *weird* depressed as a kid, and around when you 16 we noticed you like *severe* depressed and we were all pretty worried about you.”
That hit me really hard. My family knew and never tried to intervene, never even tried to talk to me about it?
Then for Christmas that year, I asked my mom that if for my gift, she could just schedule me a psychiatrist appointment. I have a lot of difficulty talking to strangers on the phone, I had tried a couple of times to schedule, but ended up panicking and hanging up. My mom didn’t do that and end up just getting me a couple of pop psychology self help books on dealing with anxiety.
I had failed out of college due to mental health problems (and honestly a poor work ethic on top of that). And I moved a couple states away with a friend. With her help, I got medication all balanced out (final diagnosis was bipolar depression presenting with psychosis and severe paranoia), got a job and finally feel like I can be a functioning member of society again. I started taking a few summer courses at the local community college to prove to myself I could manage a full workload. Classes are going great! Work sucks, but what do you expect from part time fast food? Started dating the friend I’m living with and we’re really happy, I even get on the phone to schedule appointments for her sometimes! It’s still hard, but it’s getting easier.

The final straw for me was yesterday when my sister told me that she and my mom were mad at me that I “chose to take a few college courses over the summer instead of visiting my dying grandfather with them.” 
He’s not sick or anything, he’s just old. They’ve been referring to him as “dying” for the past 3 years.
I just snapped over that. I told my sister to go fuck herself and blocked her number. I feel like they just don’t take me or my mental health seriously. And if they aren’t going to be a part of my support network, I don’t want to deal with them.
Part of me feels like I’m just being a petty child over all this, so I want to know if I’d be the asshole.

c48fya	2019-06-23 17:47:53	i_regret_life	AITA for wanting the best room in the house that was promised to me when my mother thinks it's unfair?	"Background: My family is at the end of a renovation of the basement that created an extra bedroom + bathroom with sauna. The room will be away from all the other rooms, downstairs, with floor to ceiling windows with views over a lake (There is also floor to ceiling windows with better views in the living room right above). There is a large terrace at the main floor level and another terrace is being constructed at the basement level in front of the fourth room (at the level of the lawn). I [19M] live in the (currently) largest room in the house. My parents live in the second largest and my brother [12M] live in the smallest. My brother's room is very small and needs a new one ASAP.


For the 1 year we have talked about the renovation and the 5+ months the renovation has taken place, I have been promised the newest and best room. My parents said I could move downstairs because my brother could then overtake my old room as he has outgrown his room. Everyone seemed happy, but then my mother quit her job about a month ago and told me she was considering making the fourth room into a second living area. She is in the process of becoming a yoga teacher and finishes next month. She said that she could use the space to teach yoga and make some money that way. She also said that we can use the room as a family because it would be unfair to give it to one person.


This made me mad for multiple reasons:
* 1. I had been promised the room for over a year. I was looking forward to moving into the room very much. I had told my friends about it from the start. Even when my parents were asked about what would happen to the room they said that I would get it, it was only recently my mother started saying ""we haven't figured it out yet"" (I should note that my father has stayed out of the conflict and hasn't chosen any sides). I feel like i've been lied to for an entire year and i'm pissed.
* 2. It fucks up the whole plan. If I can't move into the new room, my brother can't move into my old room. My mother said that he could just switch with my parents but that makes no sense because a double bed can't even fit in it (the room is quite narrow). An even if it could fit, it would block the closet that's built into the wall and render it useless.
* 3. I just finished my second year of high school and have one year left (not an american system, average to be 18-19yrs in my country at this stage). After I'm done I would probably take a year off and travel a bit, work abroard maybe, before I enter university. This means I have 2 years max left in the house. I want to enjoy the 2 years I have left living with my family and after that they can use it for what ever they want. 
* 4. She started using other words to describe the room. She started reffering to it as a ""living space"", before she used Bedroom. She also started reffering to the walk-in closet as a ""storage space"".

Since we both like to add decent amount of cream and sugar to our coffee and the coffee cup at this place is pretty small. 

The waitress pour all way to brim to point where we can’t even put anything in it without spilling coffee all over. 

Every time the waitress come by, she quickly pour it back up to brim without asking. We even tried to ask her few times to stop! We tried to tell her to leave some room.

Fianlly, she just kinda smirk and say “oops” as she filled my cup to brim.

Fed up with this. I wait until she have her eyes on me. 

I lift cup and bring it away from the table and pour some onto the floor then put it back on the table and put in cream and sugar.

The waitress was upset and asked what was I doing! I told her she repeatedly ignored our and we are tired of it.

c48dab	2019-06-23 17:43:08	throwaway29283888683	WIBTA for throwing away my daughter’s makeup?	"Throwaway account. 

For context, my daughter is turning 16 in a month and has a clear obsession with how she looks. She’s beautiful, of course, but she takes hours getting ready everyday just to look presentable. She wears tons of makeup, and she loves it. She also get her hair re-dyed black every six weeks. (which my mother despises, but personally I could care less about the color of her hair) My family and I have hated how much she wears makeup, it was never a huge thing growing up to wear as much as she does, especially to school. 

She’s very talented, however, and from what i’ve learned from her, her makeup skills are fairly high, especially for her age. She does makeup for her school’s theater program whenever they have shows, and she’s also learning how to do SFX makeup. 

Recently her hours spent getting ready have gotten in the way of doing things, if she doesn’t have time to put on makeup, she will cry and refuse to go somewhere. I’m getting really fed up with it and I’m sick of her constantly needing to wear tons of makeup to feel pretty. 

My wife and I never buy her this makeup, unless it’s for her birthday or another holiday, she buys all of her makeup with her own money. She spends all of her allowance on makeup, and it drives my wife and I nuts. She has so much, it takes up majority of her desk space. It’s what she loves, and what she’s good at, but she doesn’t need as much as she has. 

Another issue with the makeup is it makes her look a lot older. She already looks around 18 without makeup, so with it she looks like she could be in her 20s. Older men prey on my daughter a lot, it’s even happened in front of me. She tells my wife stories about men who try to get her attention in the mall, or other places that she goes. I hate it. 

So, I recently had the idea to throw majority of her makeup in the trash. I’m hoping that it will prevent her from needing it as much and will stop her from buying so much of it. High end makeup (which is a majority of what she has) is expensive, but I don’t know what else to do at this point. 

WIBTA?

Edit: After seeing everyone tell me I’m the asshole, I agree. 

I’ve talked to my daughter about it, she didn’t really wanna hear it but I told her this has to get better. My wife and I told her about how she’s beautiful and doesn’t need makeup to cover it. This is definitely a deep rooted self-esteem issue and I’m hoping if she starts going back to counseling (She was heavily bullied by her peers in the past and had to attend it) she will get better. 


Also many have been seeing this as a “shitpost” but I can promise it’s not. I just didn’t know what to do at first but I’m hoping this situation will get better just by talking about it.

To be clear, I'm a heterosexual tomboy and I just don't feel comfortable wearing dresses (much less buying them).  I did, however, have a brand new, three-piece suit for job-hunting interviews.  The suit was double-breasted in solid dark blue and I pressed the pants for the occasion.  My sister was gracious enough to take it in stride without raising an eyebrow.  My mother, however, spit the words ""You wore a suit!"" under her breath when she thought no one else could hear so I knew I had upset her.

My rationale was to dress up as much as I could for the occasion without having to buy a dress I would only ever wear once.  I felt that what I wore would have been perfectly appropriate for a man to wear and so I would not stick out unduly in the wedding photos.

She's been searching for a new job for the past few months, but hasn't had any luck. This morning she was offered a job and has been really excited about it. But the more she told me about it the more it made me uneasy. There were some red flags, so I decided to investigate and found more:

* It was a European non-profit that was opening an office in a mid-size city in the US (why here? Why not NY or LA?)
* There was no interview process. Just a resume and an online questionnaire.
* **I can't find a single thing about them online.**
* The address on their website doesn't show up on Google Maps.
* They claim to be registered as an LLC (why LLC? Why not a 501 (c)?). And even if they are an LLC, they're not registered with our state
* The email she's been in contact with doesn't match the email listed on the website
* I did a reverse image search on the pictures on their website and they're stock photos.

She's pretty upset (though not directly at me), and I feel like like such a dick for trying to prove they're a scam. However, the thing I can't answer is if they're a scam, what's the scam? What the use of offering a fake job?

She was really gorgeous, shapely, smart, and smelled really good. We hung out a few times, and I thought things were going well.

Then she told me that she wanted me to put her in touch with another friend of mine who could further her career. She told me she'd sleep with me if I did. I... told her I'd do it, but not to worry about that.

We hung out with my other friend, and they hit it off well enough. Afterwards, she set my friend up with another friend of hers and we went out. She told me that she hadn't meant the offer to sleep with me as a bribe, but that she was shy and awkward, and still wanted to do it. And told me that if I wanted to do it, to meet where we first ran into each other the next day.

During our double date, she and her friend kept mentioning this runner guy who is a big deal at my uni. I asked her about it later, and she said she had always had a crush on him, but had never met him, and he had always been a big inspiration to her.

My heart just sank. This guy is much better looking, taller, fitter and... fuck, I just could not ever see me competing with him, let alone winning. The night ended and I decided it was best to call things off. Plus, who knows if she'd even show up.

So, I didn't go.

A friend later asked me if I had fought with this girl, because he had seen her where we were supposed to meet, dolled up and crying her eyes out.

I... don't know what to think. Haven't spoken with her.

c47x10	2019-06-23 17:13:00		WIBTA maritage and student financial woes	"First reddit post...thanks for any insight you all can provide. Back story: I spent 6 years going full time to undergrad and then prerequisites at a community college to apply to medical school. Initially, my wife was working on a master's degree, then graduated about a year later, and began working. During those 6 years I took out $25k in loans and worked an avg of 30 hrs/week to cover rent and living expenses. While I was applying to medical schools she she decided she wanted to go back to pursue becoming a PA (previous degrees were not related) and applied to a post bacc program. She got accepted but the very next day I got accepted to medical school in another city. 

After much debate about who should accept, she decided to rescind her acceptance and move with me to the new city. The plan was for her to take her classes at community colleges since there weren't any prep programs and we would live off my student loans. 

Fast forward a year and it's now a problem because we can't afford to live solely off my loans. We didn't know there would be such hard restrictions on loan limits. (Not that we need a ton more, we are living very frugally...just an expensive city). She takes two classes and just started a job working approx 6 hours a week (work experience for her PA application). Now that we're in this situation, the only real options are for her to work more (she says it would be too much for her) or take out student loans (with me co-signing) but she doesn't want to because she doesn't think she should be responsible for any more since that wasn't the agreement (salient point: her post bacc would have been $30k vs free at her current community college). She also says she is afraid if we were to ever divorce she'd owe the money and doesn't trust I would pay. (I don't know why she thinks that...I told her I'm just as responsible for it as a cosigner but she won't budge). I told her we don't really have much choice but she doesn't seem to care and appears to be leaving it to me to figure out. 

I can afford to pay all the rent, utilities, and my share of food and other expenses, but not her personal expenses (phone, car, school supplies, food, etc.) Would I be the asshole if I told her she's responsible for her bills now?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c47s85	2019-06-23 17:04:19	124inches	AITA for being angry at my sister for taking my kids to a Catholic Mass?	"I was brought up Catholic like the rest of my family but left after I was confirmed. I was pretty disgusted with the church's views on LGBT issues and unfairness of not allowing any women leaders. Once I came out as bisexual in college that solidified that I was obviously never returning. I got married in my ex-husband's far more liberal Lutheran church and both of my kids (now 9F and 7M) were baptized in it even though neither of us were particularly religious. After the marriage ended I realized a big part of why it didn't work, I'm not really bisexual, and decided that I wouldn't have a workable marriage with a man. My ex actually became very supportive and understanding of this in time and eventually had no hard feelings, he even invited me to the wedding when he was remarried. Since then I've occasionally taken the kids to a Lutheran church and enrolled my daughter in a youth program per her request, but I'm fine with it as the church is pretty accepting of LGBT relationships and has many LGBT members. 

Last week my current girlfriend and I planned a little getaway to a lake resort up north and she requested that it be just us with no kids. I contacted my ex to see if he would take the kids that weekend even though it wasn't one of his visitation weekends with them, but he and his new wife were also busy. So I asked my sister to babysit. She was thrilled at the idea and loves my kids, so she readily agreed. We went on the trip and had a great time, and the kids seemed to have a great time with her as well. When I talked about what they did my daughter mentioned she took them to church but it was a little different from what they're used to. When I confronted my sister she admitted she took them to a Catholic Mass as she starting regularly attending again a few months earlier. 

I was furious. I was wondering how on Earth she could think it'd be OK to submit her niece and nephew to a church that teaches that me and their new Mommy are going to hell and during Pride month to boot. I gave her some angry calls about this. My sister remained unphased and said she didn't understand the big deal, it's not ""that much different"" than the Lutheran church I sometimes take them to and there was no condemnation of same sex relationships there nor has there been any time she attended. I then threatened that unless she promises to never ever do that again she won't be babysitting them ever again...or visiting us or being invited to any events in their lives and she should probably let the rest of the family know that anyone who takes my kids to Mass will be cut out of our lives for good. At that point my sister broke down in tears. I haven't spoken to her since then. Now I feel pretty shitty.

When she does, it’s after a friendship has already been established that the romantic feelings start to kick in. This is how she’s always explained it to me anyway.

Last weekend we went out with a group of my friends, one of which I share an open interest in, Nessa. She’s beautiful, brilliant, fun, funny, just generally a great person who everybody instantly loves.

I’m currently in a long term relationship with Lucy, and we discuss our shared crush on Nessa openly. This interest is mutual and we’ve even mentioned to Nessa that a threesome is on the table at some point. We’re all flirty and we make out sometimes although it’s not gone beyond that yet, we’ve basically all got this nice little three way crush thing happening. Nessa is free to do as she pleases in her single life, though she has turned down advances in favor of one or both of us; not by request, just her own preference. 

Now Jenny has only met Nessa once, but I did notice they were talking a bit and just figured it was cool that my friends were getting to know each other. Jenny doesn’t crush easily, so the thought never crossed my mind. However, last night she admitted to me that she was into Nessa romantically. 

We’d been drinking, so I wasn’t really thinking about tact and didn’t take her super seriously because everybody loves Nessa. I blurted that, “oh of course, everybody has a crush on her! I’d forget about it though, she’s already spoken for” in a laughing way, but Jenny was visibly upset by this. She pressed for more details on what I meant by that, so I went on to say that Nessa wouldn’t do that, she’s Lucy’s best friend and we have a good thing going between us, it would feel like a betrayal. Basically “we liked her first so you can’t like her too”. 

And again, Nessa is free to do as she pleases and doesn’t know anything about this conversation. I have no idea if Nessa is actually into Jenny or not, but I know that she is into Lucy and I and believe that she wouldn’t go for one of our friends out of respect. All I did was express that, albeit in an insensitive way.

Jenny didn’t have much to say after that. I tried to address it, apologized for being so blunt and explaining that I didn’t think she was that serious about it as they’d only met that one night. I told her she was free to make a move and I would try not to let it affect our friendship, just that I didn’t think that Nessa would go for it. I was trying to be honest with Jenny as a friend, but maybe I should’ve just been supportive instead? She said that she regrets telling me about the crush altogether.

So, am I the asshole for giving my honest reaction and input on Jenny’s crush?"	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c47ovs	2019-06-23 16:58:21		WIBTA if I asked my roommates to get rid of the extra stuff in the bathroom?	"I have two roommates, both of whom have some hoarding tendencies. I'm the polar opposite, a minimalist at heart. From my perspective, their rooms are something else. Not in a good way. But I don't get into that, they're free to arrange their living space as they see fit, and I have the same right when it comes to mine.

However I take an issue with hoarding in shared spaces. Namely the small bathroom all three of us use. E.g. the toothbrush holder, which is pretty big and meant for all of us, now contains 5 toothpastes and 3 toothbrushes, none of which are mine. There's also a stray toothpaste next to the holder. You do the math, but something doesn't add up. Similarly, there's empty shampoo bottles in the shower, or products they evidently don't use because they haven't been moved in months. One roommate also bought a new box of cotton swabs and opened it with the old one still half-full on the counter.

I don't like to meddle, but they're taking up valuable space at this point. Would I be the asshole if I encouraged them to remove some of this stuff? Is that considered as invading their privacy?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I never go to visit mostly because I prefer my mom and stepdad so whenever I have free time I’ll go visit them instead. 

For the past year my dad has been hounding me to go visit and was getting increasingly upset because I hadn’t been. So I decided to go for a week. 

My stepsister is used to running around the house butt naked, and it makes me really uncomfortable. She crawls all over me naked, she climbs on chairs and stairs and tables naked, and my dad and stepmom do not think to blink an eye at this. She enjoys seeing me, so she’ll jump into my lap naked. I am not ok with this. 

No underwear. No NOTHING. 

Obviously it’s really awkward for me and so I asked them one night if they could dress her when I’m around. My stepmom basically accused me of some really nasty things and she refused to accept any point of view. She kept saying ‘she’s a kid, you’re nasty you’re nasty’. Eventually I looked at my dad square in the eye and asked him if he *seriously* *truly* didn’t get where I was coming from. He said I was making a big deal over nothing and that I was fucked in the head so I left. 

Since then my dad has called me maybe 70+ times but I’ve ignored each and every call. I can’t believe he’d side with her over this. I talked to my mom and stepdad and both of them think I was 100% right.

c47n3d	2019-06-23 16:54:58		AITA for hating my father and my sister?	"I've always wondered why my dad disliked me. It's hard for him to say a simple ""hello"" or ""happy birthday"". When my little sister was born he always cared more for her. Our father-son- relationship has always shitty and we never talked about things people talk about, never went anywhere, never did anything together. My little sister has always been his favorite child, even though he'd rather die than admit it. It's clear tho. That's also the reason why i always saw both of them as ""bad"". Even today i still can't really stand my sister as she's always liked to lie about me, knowing my dad would punish me no matter what.  I started deeply disliking both over the years.
I never knew why he was like that.

Today, at 20 years old, i asked him what the issue was all along. Why he seemed so annoyed in my presence, why he can't wish me a happy birthday, why he liked my sister more than me, why he never spoke to me.

The answer was: it has always been all my fault. Even after 2 hours of talking he refused to see him being in the wrong, refused to admit he likes my sister more, said i was crazy and also had an explanation for it:

When i was about 2-5 years old i didn't like him. I never wanted to play with him and refused to do anything where he was also present. He then decided that that's just how i am, and it was better if left me alone. (He also said my ""lone wolf"" personality is why i don't have any friends) 

He gave me all the materialistic stuff, but ignored me. Because i didn't like him. When i was a kid.
I was in tears when he said that i just have a twisted view on life, i don't want to see how it's my fault, and at one point told me that i am ""evil"" for hating my sister, probably because of a bad spirit ""inside of me"" (yes, he is a religious).
I'm confused whether it's me that's way too sensitive and it was my fault for being distant as a child, thus making him leave me alone? Is that maybe why i can't feel any love for him?

c47l6n	2019-06-23 16:51:24		AITA For Not Telling Husband Of Abuse	"Throwaway Account. Long post

Background: Husband ( 38M) and Me ( 32 F) have been married 9 years ( together 11 years) - 3 kids. 

&#x200B;

Past: Had boyfriend in high school ( G Rated). Stayed at home went to college and got a job at a large company 20000 employees to work on weekend. Soon after starting ( Dave) started asking me out. Gave in ( however said - anything past 1st base no go until I felt comfortable. Dave was not a good fit - tried to break up and he said his mom was sick and he needed me - so I stayed.   
THE ABUSE 

Driving Dave from work at 10 pm he told me to drive behind some closed stores. I am 5'1 and 105 pounds Dave 6'1 and over 300+. He demanded s\*x - I said no .That is when he started beating the crap out of me. I remember getting into the fetal position and being in tons of pain ( nothing like I ever knew). I did not know what to do. All of a sudden his hands were around my neck. I felt myself going unconscious . I must have been screaming because right then a cop car pulled up with sirens. And Dave told me not to say anything - I did not and broke up with him the next day.  

Aftermath

Next week Dave threw a chair at me in the break room at work. There was a manager present but did not want to deal with ""dating issues"". I was scared - I thought a new boyfriend could protect me. I started dating ""Tim"". He agreed to 1st base only. Not my best idea. 

HELL

Dave went crazy over me dating someone new. Non-stop calling with voice messages. The messages started as "" we need to talk"" to "" I am a b\*\*\*\*"" to "" I am going to pay for what I did to him"" to "" He was going to enjoy seeing me die when he straggles the life out of me"". The progression happened over about a month. He started stalking my house leaving mail with details of violence.

Where It All Went Down

I was working a position at work that was in a supply closet - one chair fit in it with walls on every side and the door. I was working for 30 minutes and suddenly Dave ( who was not suppose to be working) tries opening the door. I try and keep it closed he tells me I will finally get what is coming to me and how much he will enjoy breaking my neck. My strength gives way and he gets the door open. I accept my fate. All of a sudden a co-worker is yelling at him and Dave runs away. I was getting my break 2 hours early. The co-worker reported that Dave was yelling at me - but he did not know more then that - Dave never got his hands around my neck 

&#x200B;

Aftermath

The next day was full of reports. ending in Dave being fired.  I do not remember if I was told I should press charges. Brad ( my now husband and other workers heard some rumors of the closet and Dave being let go. But they think he just wanted to talk and I was telling him no. 

&#x200B;

Later

Tim and I broke up and a while later Brad and I started dating marrying 2 years later. Text messages from Dave ( different numbers) started up for 3 years - last one be he will make me pay one day. Dave is now in the illegal selling of guns."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We have been arguing quite a bit lately because I don’t want to have his last name as my own. It’s 13 letters long, has 5 syllables and is very hard to pronounce. Perhaps I’m being petty, but I don’t and have never liked his last name. He knows that I’m not too fond of his last name, too.

I’ve brought up the option to keep my own last name after we get married. However, my fiancé has said numerous times that this makes him feel like we’re not actually getting married. He brought up how people will always think we’re just girlfriend and boyfriend, not an actual married couple.

I therefore suggested that he have my maiden name instead, to which he said that it was a stupid idea and that men don’t take their wife’s last name. We’re both not religious, but he said that this wasn’t traditional. When I tried to talk about this further he got angry with me, asking me if I truly loved him and wanted to marry him. I was so shocked that he asked me that.

I haven’t brought it up since, but I am still not wanting to change my last name to his. Does this make me an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Let’s begin; My ex and I were together for almost two months. Things were amazing in the beginning, we hit it off instantly and decided to date shortly after a few dates (pretty soon, I know). However recently, I got into a car accident where a transport truck hit me on the highway. At the hospital, they didn’t do any cat scans on my brain they assumed I passed out from the anxiety but I did start physiotherapy. These last few weeks after the accident, I’ve become distant and moody towards my ex. He says I’ve gotten mad over the smallest issues, I’ll be happy & then angry or sad the next and I totally isolated myself from hanging out with him. Also, haven’t been in the mood for sex which I could tell was affecting him. I was frantic sometimes, for no reason at all during our fights. He would gaslight me, call me crazy and manipulative for pointing out something he did that irritated me, at one point he said I was “a psychopath, just like my father”. We’ve been fighting constantly, and I’ve felt like I’m going insane. I asked my friend for her opinion, and she said I’m totally logical and not acting different at all. On my birthday, we had a great day but when I left, I had a complete mental breakdown and had to pull over. This was definitely rock bottom. I was absolutely hysterical because I just didn’t feel normal. We broke up later that night, because “he just couldn’t do it anymore” and told me I need to take time to ”fix” myself and we can try again later when I’m “better”. He tried to be supportive but sometimes it was a lot of pressure to be what he needed (he’s very needy and affectionate). The next day, I went to get checked out (for my own sake) and found out I have a concussion and signs of PTSD. I don’t want to excuse my behaviour for my concussion, I take full responsibility for everything but the doctor said it definitely would have an affect on my personality. Anyways, my ex boyfriend said when I’m better we could try again and see if I’ve “changed” but I don’t know if that’s just bullshit. I’m torn between just moving on completely before I get more hurt or hoping that one day we can be together?

c47hzp	2019-06-23 16:45:28		AITA for not being an active stepmom?	"I’ve been married for 6 years. It hasn’t been easy and we have been on the brink of divorce almost the entire time. There are 2 boys involved (one my bio son) and then my SS. Up to the last year, we have sough marriage counselor and our marriage is now 100% better, we get along and the boys see it. 

I do not have a relationship at all with SS’s BM. She doesn’t speak to me and co-parents successfully with my SO. I’ve often wondered why, but it has literally always been like this and I’ve never upset her and there’s never been drama or anything like that. I have always respected their co-parenting communications and I don’t really get involved unless the weekend schedule changes (I’ll chime in if there’s a conflict but I’m usually passive). I’m happy to do whatever SS needs and we even adjust the things we do for SS when he’s here.  The whole point to this post — I don’t really interact with SS. I say hello and I take care of everything to make sure he’s comfortable, but that’s it. For various reasons. Since I don’t really speak to his mom (and for whatever reason she doesn’t want to speak with me), I don’t want to overstep boundaries. He’s allowed to do whatever he wants basically, and I just don’t agree with that parenting style. He’s not messy or disrespectful - he’s a decent kid,  but has very little self-awareness about life in general (14M). This used to be a topic in past arguments, but I’ve just given up. He’s spoiled, “babied” by both bio parents, and that’s just not how I was raised. Anytime I even try to mention eating healthier or adjusting his eating habits, it’s an argument. So I just don’t get involved anymore. It feels easier and safer tbh. And it sucks. 

AITA for just not being engaged? It feels better than countering parenting decisions my SO makes as well as BM as my feedback never goes over well, no matter how constructive or polite I am. I want to be involved, however, as I raise my son differently (15M - he does chores, will get a job next year, understands the value of money, etc), it just feels like my parenting style clashes with theirs."

My brother is a couple years younger than me (he’s 17) and has to be constantly reminded to brush his teeth every day. I understand putting it off for a couple hours if you’re just having a lazy day at home, but he often “forgets” before we go somewhere in public, as was the case today. 

Today I was trying to have a conversation with him but couldn’t stand being near him due to the stench of his mouth. I’m not sure when he brushed last but his teeth were yellow and visibly caked with plaque. I told him he was almost an adult and that he ought to be able to brush his own teeth without being reminded by now, and that I’m worried his future girlfriend/wife will have to parent him this way one day. He got kind of upset and I just walked away. 

Later, my mom told me I was being mean to him. She said that I have no room to talk because I should have ironed my dress before going out but no one reminded me to do that. I countered that that’s not a measure of hygiene, but of appearance. Now I’m having second thoughts, though, and maybe I was being too harsh. AITA?"	Not enough info	0	0	72.0	19.0	0.0	0.0

Three months later, and him not hitting the gym anymore, skipping class a lot, and never hanging out with the rest of his friends / family, I can definitely see his life slowing down and being a lot more unproductive. I do what I thought was a good idea, and tell him if he keeps hanging out with her he’s going to fall in love. All I got in return was him being in denial. I then remind him of her home wrecking past, and he gets mad calling me an asshole. I just don’t want my friend to get serious with someone he clearly knows he shouldn’t be dating with a rational mindset.

Me (33M) and my fiance (27F) have been together for a year now, and we both have kids that we've brought in from previous relationships, in addition to our own child together who was born a month ago. 

My daughter, who is 7, unfortunately doesn't spend a lot of time with us. I usually handle the disciple for her, though I've never had an issue with my fiance stepping in if need be.

My fiance's son, who is 4, spends most of his time with us. He spends time with his father too, though he isn't very keen to discipline. This results in a lot of acting out when he's at home with us. He wants to fight about everything, from brushing his teeth and getting dressed in the morning all the way until eating dinner or getting a bath. He screeches, stomps his feet, throws whatever he can get his hands on, slaps, kicks, bites, etc. When he gets sent to his room he hurls books and other things at the door, and has broken quite a few toys and other things.

My fiance has given me a back seat in disciplining him because he's her child and she wants him to be raised a certain way. I'm of the belief that he needs a strong father figure in his life to teach him proper discipline, since I know his biological father isn't involved in doing that, nor does he want to be. Recently we've butted heads about it because it makes me feel like she doesn't want to include me in that part of her life, and I feel like we should share that responsibility as a couple. She says she doesn't want me doing it because she feels like he'll be afraid of me and that I'm an asshole as he gets older.

I don't mind conflict as I come from an argumentative family, but being with him, if I feel like conflict is like his worst fear imaginable and even showing an ounce of frustration puts him in a bad place

\--

My boyfriend (27) and I (24) have been together for about 4 years. 2 of those years were long distance, but we saw each other every weekend. This is important because I feel (possibly) because of the distance we haven't been able to get to know each other properly. To be brief, I feel like he's still stuck in the mindset that he can't complain about my behaviour out of fear he's 'overreacting' or that fighting isn't normal or healthy in a relationship.

Every god damn time I get upset he basically shuts up and doesn't know what to say or do, apologizes and then tells me how bad he feels. If HE gets frustrated towards me, he will assume all responsibility, apologize and then tell me how bad he feels for feeling frustrated in the first place. If I'm just upset in general (not at him) he'll just tell me ""Don't be upset! Only smiles, you're smart and beautiful you can do it."" and literally provide no advice OR ANYTHING and I know he's being sincere but it is SO UNHELPFUL IT DRIVES ME UP A WALL.

I've had this conversation over and over before, where I tell him his feelings are valid and it's okay to be upset/angry/whatever and just talk about it. I genuinely try to be positive and supportive about it, and work around this insecurity of..I don't know...losing me if he reveals an ounce of negative emotion? Usually, just response is ""I don't know why I'm upset :("" and he'll deescalate the situation and say it's not a big deal, whatever whatever.

&#x200B;

ANYWAY, WIBTA for just ripping him a new one over being too much of a nice guy? or am I overreacting and I should be an appreciative asshole for having such a good partner?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I'd like to clarify that by an argument, I don't mean one-sided screaming at him. We've never had that type of relationship and I don't intend to make it like that. I've had so many conversations about trying to get him to be honest about how he feels, and negative emotions are okay. Everything doesn't have to be sunshine and roses. But 4 years into it, nothing has changed and there have been no signs of progress and I don't know much about him despite all this time.

By ripping him a new one, was some colourful wording to mean...so far expressing to him (over and over and over) that his lack of openness and honesty (regardless if his dishonesty is out of kindness) is hurting the relationship and that I have no idea where he is in the relationship. It's just stayed the SAME and I feel like I need to just have an actual fight and finally get him to admit how he feels. About me, about THINGS, about life?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c478g8	2019-06-23 16:27:50	TheSheev	WIBTA for calling the cops/suing my neighbor over a fence?	"So two days ago, I'm sitting in my office and my nest app alerts me to movement in my backyard. Typically this doesn't happen in the morning on a Friday, as my fiance also works Friday mornings. So when I check it, I notice that there are people in my back yard, taking down the privacy fence that borders my neighbors yard. Now, the posts are on my side of the fence, and the owner before us left items attached to the fence to make the ambiance of the area feel more rustic. From what I can tell, the people doing the (de)construction destroyed all of the items in the process and threw them into a pile in my yard.  


I called my fiance after I got home to see exactly what kind of damage they did and she was livid. We've been at her mother's since for plans we made months ago, but we brought it up with her mother, and I said I'm considering calling law enforcement to file a vandalism claim and/or sue them over the 40' of fence they replaced, to which she replied was a little overboard.  


The neighbor never once came and asked us about getting the fence replaced, nor was it on disrepair (on our end at least). They also put the panels up with the posts now on their side instead of ours. Where I grew up this is considered theft of property, which is why I'm considering suing.  


WIBTA if I did these things?  


Info: The fence is on our property. The person who put the fence up was the owner of our house before we bought it. When I tried talking to the neighbor after I got home they ""weren't home."" We don't have the most cordial of relationships as I gave them a thorough chewing out for using our driveway for a party of theirs without our consent a year or two ago."

c4757d	2019-06-23 16:21:46	SloaneTheBitch	WIBTA for giving up on household chores?	"I'm (21F) burnt out, guys. I've expressed this to my boyfriend (22M), and made quite a few mentions to our roommate, Ava (25F). If I'm cleaning my house like a crazy person they might come and help out, but my boyfriend will rarely ever clean without being asked. He won't cook unless I've said we're cooking, and even then I do most of the work. I've expressed to him that I'm *incredibly* annoyed with this. I usually work 12 hour days, and just once I'd like to come home and not have to make food for us. Or on my days off, I'd like to hear an ""I'll figure out dinner, babe!""  His excuse for not helping is that I take over cooking dinner, I go too fast for him, and ""since you never liked cooking for anyone else I figured I'd let you do your thing since you like cooking here.""

*((Important context: I hated cooking at my parents or for my ex, because the lot of them used to make fun of me while I cooked. It was gross behavior that made me despise cooking as a whole. However, when I moved in with my current boyfriend we used to cook **together** all the time. It was fun until I became literally the only person who would plan meals, go to the grocery, or cook.))*

Ava will do the dishes once they're piled up enough to not see the counter, and she'll do her laundry and leave her clean clothes piled up on our kitchen table for weeks (we rarely eat in the kitchen or use this, but its just obnoxious to look at, you know?) Her bedroom is a wreck, her room and our living room have become storage units for her craft supplies because she's too depressed to clean everything up. It would take a solid two day's work to go through that shit and get it tidy, and I completely understand being overwhelmed with clinical depression and not wanting to clean - but I have *offered to help her clean it on our days off.* I've offered to get a storage unit for the lot of us to clear up all the clutter, but there's always some excuse not to. 

I've suggested chore charts - too rude to Ava. I've suggested designating two days a week as a cleaning days - our schedules are too messy. I finally broke down the other day and told my boyfriend that I want to just quit doing everything around the house, and let them figure out how to be adults on their own, because I'm tired of cooking, cleaning, and making every decision for us as a couple. His response was ""So.. you want me to be your maid?""

Like no, dude. I just don't want to be your mom.

They're both good people whom I love more than anyone else in the world, and I don't want to *leave* here, but I'm pretty upset about this. We all work relatively the same amount of hours, theres no reason why they can't put in at least half as much work as I do. I feel like the only way to make them realize that is to just do absolutely fuck all around the house and go on strike. 

But would that make me the asshole?

There's a big news story about Pride flags being ripped down all over town. It's started a counter-movement of support, so I bought a flag and I plan on putting it up.

However, I have a parent who's very politically involved in the town, and he doesn't want the house and my grandparent living there involved in anything 'political'. He wants to keep the house safe from the crazies, but also avoid people going after him with questions. He doesn't want the flag up for those reasons.

I'm thinking it should be fine because he can just say it's my flag, not his, and it's Pride Month and hanging pride flags is very common in the nearby liberal city.

On one hand, I really want to show my support for LGBTQ+ people here because it sucks here, but I also understand that we don't really want to get the house involved, and my dad being pestered by town crazies. But also, how do we expect kids to thrive in this neighbourhood if the simple act of hanging a flag is too 'political' and scary and we hide along with everyone else? How can we make kids have to be so brave just to be themselves, when we're too afraid to put up a flag?

I work in the cinema, so I get 8 free tickets a month but management doesnt count so its basically as many as you can get away with. 

Ive been to the cinema multiple times with my family, on one request that they can clean up after themselves. I dont mean pick up every piece of popcorn form the floor, I just mean taking your tubs cups etc out with you. 

My dad has never respected this rule, and I told him if he keeps leaving trash I wont get him free tickets anymore. He then did it again and when I told him to take his rubbish he said ""Well its their job to clean it up.""

This honestly infuriated me, how disrespectful he was to me and my coworkers. Plus, could you imagine being my coworkers and seeing my family leave multiple tubs and cups? I ended taking HIS rubbish. I told him when we got home I am no longer getting him tickets, he can pay for them. 

Now, I booked 2 tickets for me and my mum to go tomorrow since I dont know my brothers work schedule (and neithere did he), so I just got the 2. Then my mum asked why I didnt get any for my dad (and brother) so I explained. Even before I told my dad about taking away his tickets I relayed it to my mum, who said its fair because the way he disrespected my and my work was incredibly rude. Recently, me and my dad stopped talking indefinitely for other reasons. 

Now my mum is saying she doesnt want to go at all because I wont get him a free ticket, or that she will go with my dad and I will go with my brother. I dont get along very well with my brother either so I dont want to go alone with him. I said I would be happy to give one of my staff passes, as long as he pays half the price for a normal ticket. 

&#x200B;

Honestly I feel like im not the asshole since I warned him multiple times, and he agreed to it. But it makes my mum upset because she feels stuck in the middle and wants us to get along (which isnt going to happen).

She has exceeded her call time and has ended up with a $300 bill which normally comes in at $20 - this is her own fault, as she only has 300 minutes its her responsibility to stay under this, she could have originally had unlimited minutes for just $5 extra. We had to get the customer on to customer services to express dissatisfaction with the extra charges on the account. 

She starts to get angry on the phone, getting visibly frustrated. It comes to a peak when she leaves the phone call, gets up out her chair and leaves the store - she SCREEEAMS in the street, comes back and continues to shout and swear. Now I'm the store manager and there's families in the store, I walk over to the lady who is now back in her seat and continuing to curse and moan. I ask her if she would please calm down...fuck I did not know what I was getting myself in for...

""Don't you fucking tell me to calm down!!! I have autism, you don't know what it's like to have fucking autism!""

...feels like a dagger to the chest, I felt like an idiot but I can't help but ask if she'd like to come back when she's feeling better...

""No, I'm dealing with this now! I have fucking autism""

I ask one of my colleagues if they could maybe ask her if she'd like some water. All the while, I feel like total shit and I'm wondering whether I was at fault - I was simply thinking about the benefit of everyone that was in store at the time.

c46w0r	2019-06-23 16:04:26	raawwrrrrrrrrrr	AITA for telling a friend I was annoyed at him changing the nature of a group?	"A few weeks earlier, me and a bunch of friends decided to open a swim group on messenger to discuss availabilities and locations for swim sessions. When in the pool we would mainly work out, and then chill We usually did this every other day.

We invited a friend, Jim. Jim wasn't always available, and hasnt been able to attend a swim session yet. 

Recently, Jim would organize monopoly sessions in the group. I wasn't quite fond of this idea because the activity he was suggesting wasn't that linked to the idea of working out, but I refrained from complaining as we could swim then play. However, Jim started to suggest the day after next for monopoly sessions during when some of us were swimming in the group. These sessions usually took a good part of the day, and when it ended the cheap public pools would all be closed.

 A few days ago, I was chatting in a messenger group for people to keep in touch after organizing a public event, which Jim was part of. Another friend, Jason, sent a message inviting the group members to help organize another event Jason was organizing. Jim replied that we should keep the chat relevant to the event that was already finished. I thought there was inconsistency on his part, and decided to imitate his wording in the swimming group about keeping the chat relevant to swimming. Jim then changed the name of the group from swimming to monopoly, which annoyed me. 

I decided to be honest about how I felt he was hijacking the swimming group. I told him that it was fine to organize monopoly, but he needed to keep in mind that the group was originally purposed for organizing swimming for workouts and he could create another group for chilling. I also told him that it was inconsistent of him to keep one chat relevant whilst organizing monopoly in a swim group.


His response was :
1. I was taking swimming too seriously. He thought swimming was simply a chill thing, that it was reasonable to assume swimming was just chill and that he would rather gym if he wanted to workout. Something was wrong with me for this.
2.He also claimed that for his case it would give others an impression that the other public event was getting participants from the one we organized, and that it would result in politics. This wont happen in the swim group.
3. I was jealous of a general consensus to play monopoly.

Whilst I stepped down at that point to alleviate the tension by apologizing, I thought:
1. His idea of swimming being chill was his only;
2. I didn't see how politics would occur as these public events in question were similar in nature  and is simply an opportunity for us to engage in the community again;
3. Swimmers were somewhat pressurized to go monopoly as we didnt want to cause divisions in the group, botching plans to swim.

So what happened was I told her that we were going to do a light birthday for her this year because I just started law school, which is very demanding, and I had a mid-term a couple of days after her Bday. She was fine until 1 week before the BDay, in which she said that wasn't good enough and she wanted to go out to eat. So I was going to take her out to eat on her bday, a weeknight, and go to a game (which was one of our first dates- the first date that we took pictures together-and I thought that would be cute). I asked if she could meet me at the restaurant because I study near there and didn't want to lose 2hrs of studying driving from school to pick her up and then back to near the school. Initially this was fine. Then the day before, this wasn't good enough, so I agreed to study less and pick her up, but by this time I had 'ruined' it. Needless to say I spent the next few days grovelling for forgiveness and failed my midterm.

I did ok at the end of the semester, but was just on the cusp of getting 'big law' internship opportunities which are based solely on that semesters grades and pay $3.5k / week as opposed to mid size firms which pay $800 / week (yes it's a steep change). Not to mention essentially have a great career lined up for when I graduate. I didn't get a big law job this summer. Because I'm primarily supporting both of us through my student loans (she does have a part-time job, but we live in my house which I pay for) this extra cash would only result in us being able to start a family sooner from when I graduate. I wasn't wanting the money so I could selfishly buy something for myself. Not saying I would have gotten those jobs if I hadn't failed the midterm, but I certainly would have gotten more opportunities.

I was severely bullied throughout upper elementary and middle school, and would often come home to the same insults and phyiscal pushdowns from him. We never got along, often times he would steal from me throughout the years, and he'd always give my parents hell. Even while I was in college, he randomly showed up to my apartment at the request of my mother, and brought a random chick and screwed her in the other room, and then magically on of my favorite video games disappeared after he left. 

Now, a couple years later, he's turned himself around to where he has a successful job and is looking to buy a house. He was living with a roommate who owned the house, and sometime this weekend, they had a falling out. So he's packing his stuff up to leave, which includes a lot of furniture and personal belongings. My parents have left the trailer for him to load his stuff up, and the person who was supposed to come help him bailed. *He has not asked me for help at all.* 

Now even though he's turned himself around financially, he and I still often do not get along. His attitude and arrogance is still the same, and he has never apologized for anything he's ever done to me. It's not as belittling as it used to be, and we have our good moments, but our relationship has always been really business oriented.

c46pxa	2019-06-23 15:53:14	Tutsks	AITA for sticking to the rules of my roommate agreement?	"This happened in the past, but I've been wondering about it. 

So, I met a girl through kijiji, she was from a different city, and asked to be my roommate for the Uni term. I've had a few roommates, and have a desirable 2 bedroom suite by the University, and I know to go over things before hand.

One of the things we discussed was having people over, at the time, I wasn't dating anybody seriously, and she suggested that it should be fine to have people over as long as they mostly stayed in our respective rooms.

I was a bit wary because a previous roommate had started dating a coworker, and he was basically living with us, but I said sure.

She moved in, had friends over relatively frequently, we watched Harry Potter and a bunch of other stuff together, and everything seemed fine.

Then, I met a girl, and we hit it off. We began dating, and she would come over for sex, a lot. She wasn't particularly loud and mostly stayed in my room, though she was out of it a couple times playing mario kart with the roommate. She even made the roommate waffles and breakfast one morning.

Anyway, roommate apparently started getting mad that I'd spend my time in my room with the girl I was dating, and made passive aggressive comments about being able to hear her and her being too loud. So we started being quieter, which was apparently sort of a fetish to the girl I was dating, so she was over even more.

Eventually, roommate told me she didn't want girl over any more, even though she cooked for her on occassion, they seemed friendly, and she was 99% of the time in my room. I told her that we had agreed that significant others could stay, and she replied that this chick was a fling and she wanted her gone. Which sorta irked me, to be honest.

Particularly because she had, in the past, come out of her room when I had dates with other girls, and interrupted things (dunno how to explain this further). 

Apparently she was previously living with her best friend, and they fell out because he started dating someone, or some such. I never saw her dating anyone, either (Tho, I must stress, she was very attractive).

Anyway, I told her we had agreed we could have people over, that the other girl had been nothing if not nice to her, and that she barely saw her. She replied that her presence annoyed her either way, and that it was her place too. I told her that it was half hers, and I'd make sure she'd stay out of her half. She said we were too loud and she could tell we were having sex all the time (we were).

Honestly, I don't know what she could or could not hear, the building was concrete and I always found it on the quiet side, plus she always seemed to have loud music playing. She said our being annoying was affecting her studying. 

Further stuff happened, but that's the relevant gist, I suppose.

"I am a 20 year old male in college on summer break right now, I live at my moms house and my dad's house about half the time (divorced), and work retail. However, I also have a job caring for my severely disabled brother and sister who are 17, both severely autistic nonverbal. They need constant care, brother is not even potty trained. I have always helped to watch them my whole life, but now I can get paid through the state for a certain number of hours to watch them.

&#x200B;

Last summer she asked me if me and my gf would stay 5 days as paid caretakers, while she went away with my aunts. (I only have a set amount of hours, would only be paid for part of the first day). Either way, I was really uncomfortable with this but she guilted me hard so I just lied and said my other job needed me that week and we couldn't. Dad ended up taking a week off from work as a vacation to watch them so she could go away (his job is very demanding, lately been working 7 days a week).

&#x200B;

Fast Forward to right now, she asks the same question of me. However, coming off of two semesters worth of counseling from school, I had the right tools to handle this. This time I was able to tell her with a firm ""no"" that I was uncomfortable taking on the responsibility of being full-time caretaker for 5 straight days. I said I would only be willing to do days, not overnights. She tried to barter with me but I held my ground, so naturally, she asks my dad who cannot because of a huge project at work. For the past month, she has been occasionally bringing it up, trying to find a way to go. She has guilted me every which way, from saying ""Oh I barely get out its a one time thing"" (She has gone on a multiple multi-day vacations every year for the past 5-6 years, even I haven't done that. Also, my dad has bro and sis every other weekend, and sometimes she goes away then, too ), to ""Well Grandma is getting a lot older I did want to go on a family vacation with her this summer"" (Grandma is old and has been suffering from leg injuries, however, she lives 5 min away and sees my mom 3-5 times a week.) Today, she texts me and asks "" If dad agrees to JUST the weekend, and their helper through another program Agrees to put them to bed Monday night, would you stay over Monday night?"" Now, that's an awful lot shorter than what originally was proposed, but my dad said no already, and just the fact that she keeps trying to ask makes me feel more uncomfortable. I know she wants a break from her hard life but I feel like it's not fair at my expense, I'm 20 and they're not my kids. I'm starting to think maybe I could just do one night, in the event my dad does somehow say yes, but the whole principle of the thing makes me want to say no, and as practiced with my therapist, I'm supposed to tell her no and not give in to the guilt trip.

&#x200B;

So, If I still say no, AITA?

EDIT: I meant  ""multiple-day trips"", not multiple single day trips, to clarify.

EDIT: It seems that there is confusion about how much I help out. I have always helped out my whole life, recently started PCA to make some money for some of it. Helped out a lot more than I wanted to last summer because I felt guilty and essentially had no life outside of retail and PCA until I went back to college (bio major college is pretty much 90% work and little fun). Became more depressed and had to go to therapy. I feel that 5 days would drive me over the edge, but am WELL aware that mom is stressed and desperate.

I am exhausted, physically and emotionally. My kids are whiny and you can tell they're just off. My husband and I told them we were having a day in today to recoup before camp/work tomorrow. 

My daughter's friends just came over and wanted to play, she told them not today and they started yelling for me from the door wanting to know why. To which I just said not today. My daughter tried to shut the door and they just kept knocking and ringing the doorbell wanting to play. 

I jumped up and told them to knock it off and we weren't playing today. My kid told me they'd be back in a couple hours to see if I've changed my mind. 

Now I feel like I should have let them decide if they were too out of it to play. 

They are 6,7 and 10. It's the 10's friends who wouldn't go away. 

Ugh. I did kind of snap at the girls when my daughter told them to stop knocking and they didn't.

I am living in an apartment complex for the first time in my life. Let me clarify this is NOT a nice apartment complex. I live on the third floor and I smoke cigarettes whilst sitting outside on the ground in a corner maybe 4 feet from my apartment door. There are no other doors near my smoking corner. I use an ash tray and I leave it in said corner. I empty it when it's full. Once I put a cigarette out, I will never ever re-light it. It is essentially garbage to me. 

Now about three weeks ago I notice my ash tray has no cig butts in it, but full of ash. It's obvious someone is taking them and most likely smoking the last three or four drags left. I am appalled. To me, that is absolutely disgusting. And my belief is, don't smoke if you can't afford to smoke. I have been smoking for 15 years, that's disgusting in and of itself but in that time I have never once 'bummed' a cig off someone because I never run out of them. I know I would go crazy if I didn't have them. There have been times in my younger years i have even chosen cigarettes over food. So I understand the addiction. I have since started either ripping off the unsmoked part and tossing it or just tossing the cig in my garbage. 

My boyfriend seems to think I am the asshole because I don't want this creepy stranger lurking around corners (literally what she does waiting for me or someone to put their cig out) taking my cig butts/garbage. He seems to think because I don't smoke them again, I'm an asshole for getting distraught over her taking them. Well, to me it's disgusting and as I said previously, if you can't afford to smoke, DON'T.

c46hak	2019-06-23 15:36:57	miss_mizery	AITA for ghosting my uncle?	"**tldr: I'm a 20 y/o woman who has moved on from familial abuse, and now an uncle who I've never met is trying to get in contact with me. I'm ignoring him, but it doesn't feel too kind. AITA for ghosting him?** 

**Background**: I was homeschooled as a kid, and my parents monitored my friend group closely -- most of my friends shared the same sort of religious upbringing, e.g. none of us ""believed in"" evolution. I was regularly beaten with a belt for mundane stuff and verbally abused just about every day (being called fat, stupid, lazy, useless, manipulative, wicked etc) by my father throughout my childhood. When I went to university, I realized that I did not agree with my parents' openly homophobic and misogynistic faith, and I left the religion. They cut me off, removed me from their healthcare, and pulled a few rather mean tricks to try to force me to move back in with them. When these failed, they sent a constant barrage of hellfire messages at me. When my mental health was bad, I begged them to back off, and they didn't; so, I don't talk to them at all anymore. I plan to keep it that way, at least for the next few years.

It's been a tough two years, but I've come out on top. I'm proud of myself and grateful to those who helped me when I needed it most. I can pay my own rent, bills, etc, which feels great. I got my ass to therapy and am managing my panic attacks, insomnia and eating disorder. And my university now gives me a full ride, so I only have one year of loans to pay.

**AITA:** Recently, one of my dad's brothers has been reaching out. I've never known him, just seen him at a few family events. To humor his desire to get to know me seems, quite frankly, tiring. I don't reciprocate his apparent desire to get to know me at this point. 

I feel bad though, because his messages seem fairly nice and reasonable. He's stressed that he disagrees with my dad about a lot of things and can be trusted, and he's offered help. But it's not like I want a relationship with him, or his help. It's like: I'm living my life and don't have any need or desire to add this uncle into it, regardless of whether he supports my dad's pitiably terrible way of doing life. It stirs up feelings of resentment when I get the sense that other people think they deserve, or have some genetically-determined right, to insert themselves in my life and expect reciprocation. That said, I don't know if my uncle actually thinks that I \*need\* to reply to him. He may just be offering much-delayed and no-longer-needed-or-relevant support. I'm generally a very nice person, I think -- at least, it is important to me and feels good to me to be kind and understanding whenever possible -- and so I don't feel too comfortable with my current way of handing the situation.

c46f5x	2019-06-23 15:32:59	rinkydinkshink	AITA for refusing to pay for a broken designer vase?	"TL:DR at the bottom. 

I visited a friend that lives in a very fancy apartment. Everything in there costs more than my month’s wages. 

I have a baby who I took with me (the point of the trip being she wanted to meet him). I suggested we meet at a local child friendly restaurant or coffee house (there are plenty) and was told no - she’d make us lunch. I explained my little one is crawling/cruising and so is into everything and so it might be easier to go to soft play. Again, it was a no. 

We arrive and I see her glass coffee table with a nice vase holding flowers. I suggest she might want to move anything of value within grabbing reach (admittedly in a half jokey way).  Halfway through the visit my little one makes a grab for one of the flowers and I can’t stop him in time. The vase crashes to the floor and smashes. My friend went into panic mode and was shouting for me to help clear it up but obviously I’m trying to keep my little one off the floor because of all the glass. I end up strapping him into his car seat so I can help. 

The whole time my friend is going on and on about the vase. I apologised over and over. 

I left pretty soon after as I could see my friend was raging.  By the time I got home I’d got a long text saying how she wasn’t annoyed about the vase getting smashed but thought I was rude for not offering to replace it for her and that she would have done that in my position. 

I replied and apologised for not offering to replace it - I was mortified that he had broken the vase and was a bit stressed. I asked if the vase was still available to buy and to send me a link. 

She sends me a link to a £300 vase which is similar to the one that was broken. Here’s where I need to know whether I was TA. I replied to say I would contribute to the replacement but I can’t afford to get her a new one. I offered her £100 towards a new one and suggested looking on eBay or something to see whether I could find that vase second hand. 

She blew up at me - told me I was rude and cheap and that I should be willing to replace things my child has broken.  I would agree if (a) I hadn’t told her to move things of value, (b) suggested we meet somewhere else and (c) it was an accident - he’s a baby! 

So, Reddit - AITA?

TL;DR - I went to a friends apartment with my baby son. I said she may want to move anything of value as he’s crawling/cruising now. He accidentally broke a vase and my friend wants me to replace it at a cost of £300. I have offered her £100 towards a new one as I can’t afford more but now she’s going at me for being rude and saying I should replace things my child has broken."	Not the A-hole	0	0	197.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

So basically I adopted my first dog with my ex and the second with my wife. They are both small (less than 10 lbs) and are truly the loves of my life. On more than one occasion they’ve saved me when my life has gotten unbearable. Pets become your family, and these two are no exception. My wife and I don’t have kids and aren’t sure we are going to. We are very content with our pups and our current life (finances without kids, etc).             
The thing that’s really pissing me off though is the way my wife’s family speaks in regards to our dogs. Every time we go to see her parents, they ask if the dogs died yet (the older dog is only 4, not like it’s okay with me either way). They haven’t visited the home we so proudly bought because it has a “rat infestation” in their words. Her dad and younger brother told me they’d kick my puppy if they ever saw it again. My wife’s older brother screamed at my dog for laying next to his wife’s stomach (she’s pregnant and my pup sensed it and she spent the entire time laying beside the bump and being overly gentle with the wife). He told me my dog was a danger to the baby (???) even though his wife thought it was cute and harmless.           
My wife laughs all of this off and thinks it’s just harmless jokes but I don’t go see them to hear about my “ratty dogs” or “when they are going to die/how I will get rid of them” or threatening violence on innocent animals. These dogs are practically my children. They aren’t aggressive and are just mellow lap dogs.          
Lately I’ve been avoiding all contact with them or attending their events and plan to say something if they ask why I’ve been avoiding them. My wife has caught on and says I’m being childish and that they’re just jokes.           
To me it’s not funny. AITA for avoiding them and feeling upset that my wife finds it funny?

c46ekr	2019-06-23 15:31:52	throwawayyyy32123	AITA for telling my mom that I don't want to live in our house?	"Throwaway just in case.

Some backstory: A little over 5 years ago my mom remarried to my stepdad. I was pretty young when they got married, 13 going on 14. Once he moved in after the wedding, though, it became immediately apparent that he and I weren't going to get along. We're on opposite sides of the political spectrum and opposite sides of the personality spectrum. He thinks I'm naive, lazy, and irresponsible. I will conceded that I have contributed to our animosity over the years. He also has a very pessimistic outlook on life. I think he treats my mother poorly, expecting far too much from her in terms of housework while not chipping him himself very much except for exterior work like mowing the lawn. He was raised in a very traditional family where the woman did the housework and the man didn't and I suppose he carries that expectation. I don't find the way he treats my mother fair at all, but if I ever dare to bring it up, I'm immediately met with him telling me how hard and exhausting his job is (my mother ALSO works full time, by the way).

Last August I FINALLY moved out. I moved to Phoenix from our home in NJ to go to college. Only problem is, I lived in the dorms, so now that it's summer I am back home until the new term starts and I'm over my stepdad's shit. My mental health was terrible in high school and improved exponentially once I got to college, but I'm back to a very low place in my depression now that I've been home. I spend a great deal of time in my room outside of work because I don't like confrontation and every time I leave my room I either get made fun of, told I should be doing something or other, or get excluded from the conversation and told I'm ""interrupting"" if I try and talk. 

This morning I just snapped. My mom confronted me and said she could tell that I was upset about something but she didn't know what, so I told her the truth. I don't want to be here. I'm sick of being made fun of and constantly berated every time I leave my room and I'm sick of being ordered around. I told her that it's not her fault but that my stepdad was really getting on my last nerve. She started to cry and told me if I didn't want to live here I could go move in with my dad. I really, really don't want to hurt my mom. I love her very much. But living with her and being around her means I also have to live with and be around my stepdad. I don't want to force her to choose between her husband and her child because that's hardly fair and I really feel like a major asshole for making her cry and potentially creating that dilemma. Despite my misgivings about my stepdad I know that my mom loves him and I don't want to be selfish or unfair. So AITA?

TL;DR I hate my stepdad. I'm back for the summer from college and he's gotten on my last nerve, so I told my mom that I don't like living in our house and she cried. I don't want to hurt her."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c46amn	2019-06-23 15:23:58	Symmersp	AITA for not wanting to go to my boyfriends family event?	"My boyfriend and I are both 20-21 and have been dating for about a year and a half. He is definitely more family oriented than me, mostly due to his Italian background, and gets together weekly with his entire family. I try and go whenever I can to his family things.  It’s hard because for 8 months out of the year we are long distance, but I still make a point of visiting with both sides of his family when I am home and I’ve even come home just for his family things before. 

He comes to my stuff when he can, not super often but my family also only really gathers a couple times a year anyways. 
There have been a few instances now where I have had other plans before he invited me to a family event and I chose to keep those plans, only for a big fight to occur after. For example, back in March I was travelling to see my best friends for the weekend for St. Patrick’s day, and had an exam on the Monday, when he asked me to come home for his grandparents party they were having, to which I said I couldn’t as I already had plans (I am long distance from my best friends too), and I would have to leave early the Sunday to study anyways. That was a big fight between us.

Now it’s Canada weekend approaching. I am home for the summer. Our friends always have a big party Saturday for Canada Day, and this year there are plans to go boating on the Sunday which is something I love to do and don’t get to do often as there are limited spots on the boat and I am not a top priority for those spots. I have out of town friends specifically coming down for this party and the boating.

Now my boyfriends grandpa is sick, and will pass soon. I have already told my boyfriend I will be there all week visiting with him, as he goes every day. My boyfriend just told me he will not be joining on the boat as he can’t take the entire weekend off from visiting, and we have the party Saturday as well as he is busy with his friends during the day that day.

He expects me also to cancel my plans to go boating and is angry with me for saying I don’t want to. I personally don’t think I am expected to be at all family things or drop my plans for family things at this point in our relationship - I’m still not even invited to weddings and what not. 

I think it would be different if we had made plans to go visit his grandparents,  and then i cancelled to go boating, but that is not the case. I also would find it different if we went boating weekly, but again there will be few times this summer I get to.

He says I only go to his things when it’s “convenient for me” - which I take offence to as there have been many times I’ve gone and it been inconvenient I just would never say that - and doesn’t see my plans as valid because it’s just partying and he had the same plans.

"So I broke up with my boyfriend about a month ago for a few different reasons, he was obviously very upset, as was I, but I thought it was the best thing to do. The next day I messaged him saying that I kinda regret what I did and we start talking daily. First making sure that we're both okay, supporting each other kinda thing.

Then I find out that I have a miscarriage and it's his. We start talking more, he supports me a lot and even invites me over to his house for him to look after me so I have an evening off. To his credit, it was a lovely idea and was very nice of him. But we haven't got back together.

Every now and then, we talk about the idea of us trying again with our relationship, but not committing either way to going separate ways or getting back together.

Recently, another guy has been showing my affection and we've kissed a few times, even did some handsy stuff with him and now my ex has found out about it and is really upset at me. I can understand why he's upset but we're both single? We're not together....

"Background info: this isn't just my parents' dog, we've agreed that it will be a family dog. We just got her yesterday, she's 9 weeks old. Our previous dog died in February. She's a toy poodle/bichon cross and she weighs about 3 pounds. We're calling her Twiggy.

Anyway. From my bedroom window this morning I heard my mom talking to our neighbour from across our (short) shared fence. Turns out their dog had just died. Mom was holding Twiggy at the time and I saw her hand the puppy across the fence for the neighbour to hold. I thought nothing of it at the time.

But 40 minutes later... still no Twiggy. I asked my mom if she wanted me to go over there and get her and she said absolutely not! The neighbour's dog just died, so she's letting her borrow our dog for as long as she wants. I said this seemed like a bad idea. We had a little back and forth that went something like this:

Mom: Stop being so jealous! She's not just your dog!

Me: I just don't think we should be loaning her out!

Mom: You're acting like a petulant child.

Me: I'm sorry, I just don't like the idea of our puppy being out of our sight and in someone else's house during its most crucial socialization period!

Mom: So you don't trust anyone?

Me: Not with my *pet!*

Some context: these neighbours are nice enough people, but not exactly our friends or anything. My mom tried to use the fact that they've had a dog before as a reason why I should trust them, but their previous dog was a brat who barked literally non-stop whenever they were away, so that doesn't reassure me at all. 

Anyway, I was worried so I went to stand by the fence just to see if I could see what they were doing. I didn't call out to them since my mom had told me DON'T ASK FOR THE PUPPY BACK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES and I didn't want her to think I was trying to hint at anything. I was there for about thirty seconds before my mom called me inside angrily, told me that I was being creepy and that I was ""staring at them with a pouty face"" (my back was turned to her, so even if I had been making a pouty face, she wouldn't have been able to see it. Also, they hadn't even noticed me).

I got pretty irritated at this point and just left entirely, since as far as I could tell I wasn't going to be listened to or taken seriously. So am I being ridiculous/an asshole?

Edit: to include some information I put in comments. She is not fully vaccinated. My mom didn't tell me when they would be bringing her back. Also, I paid for this dog. It was $1000 that came entirely from my pocket."	Not the A-hole	0	0	148.0	22.0	0.0	0.0

c460ol	2019-06-23 15:04:37	confusee-burner	AITA for snapping at my sister for telling my mum not to pray for her.	"I’m only posting this as my sister is upset, and my boyfriend agrees with her that I was out of line. 

Also, posting on my alternative account to prevent people I know from seeing this.

My sister has been going through a tough time, recently been sacked from her job and her boyfriend has become increasingly distant. She’s 22 and has moved back home. I’m 19 and home from university. Our parents are Christians yet both myself and my sister are agnostic.

She was telling  how she was talking to my mum about being worried about getting a job and feeling like her life isn’t on track.  My mum responded with sympathy and added that her and my dad have been praying for her everyday and will do whatever they can to help. Adding that she believes God has a plan for her and won’t forsake her. 

My sister then began getting angry and shouting at my mum, she said that she doesn’t believe in God so her prayers mean nothing and so does the promise of God’s plan. She also told her that she was sick of hearing that our parents are praying for her and that they’re stupid for believing that could ever work so they shouldn’t pray for her.

After she told me all this I responded by saying that, although we’re on the same page about our faith, she missed a big part of what my mum was saying. She genuinely believes that God has ultimate power to change her life for the better and the dedication of praying for her everyday is, if anything, a loving act. 

This made her angry and she starting shouting at me and told me that I was stupid for allowing my parents to try to convert me into a Christian and that they were sad people to believe in the ‘magic’ of God. (Despite the fact they’ve never tried to push us to be Christians after we explained our beliefs). She also said I’m doing a bullshit degree that will get me nowhere in life and shouldn’t think I am sooooo clever. 

So I said to her ‘You’re so closedminded and that’s not gonna help you in life. Nobody is forcing you to agree with them, you’re just being a dickhead for no reason. I doubt that’s gonna help you get a job.’ And walked away. 

She went crying to her friends and won’t talk to me. 

AITA?

Edit: (to include what I should’ve probably have originally said in my post) 

I was being supportive about her issues (like her boyfriend being useless and helping her search for a new job) up until the conversation changed."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	8.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c45x4l	2019-06-23 14:57:55	DDR238	AITA for showing up at my cousin's wedding in a hoodie and jean shorts?	"Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. 

I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. 

So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c45vcf	2019-06-23 14:54:28	goldgiratina	AITA for not investing myself into my relationships with certain people?	"I'm going to try describing this as clearly as possible. I do not really put any of my emotions with some of the people I hang out with. I interact them enough to normally consider them friends but I do not do so, much less consider them actual friends of mine. The reason I do so is because I dislike certain parts of them and I am very confident that they would sell me out to other people if given the chance. Hence, I distance my emotions in those relationships to avoid being heartbroken if something bad happens as like a form of insurance.

This has happened in numerous situations and it certainly saved myself from being heartbroken. When I interact with them, I mostly put on a fake front. I am being sort of fake towards them but I do not do anything negative when it comes to them. Eg, revealing secrets, selling them out and more. I do not really like acting this way towards people but I encounter such people so much in my life that I have to put up a front. If I was around my friends, I would not act in such a way. I wish to hear your opinions on my behavior.

Personally, I feel bad that I have to ""lie"" in this case, both to those group of people and myself. I am not comfortable with this action but I feel that it is necessary in order for me to tolerate and put up with their behavior whenever I inevitably encounter them."

c45v0r	2019-06-23 14:53:48	fuzzywunder	AITA for not wanting the kids that play outside to be so noisy	"I (34F) live in an apartment block, one of the rooms looks out onto a communal area and there are a group of kids (using about 5 or 6 of them) that play out there. Obviously I don’t have an issue with the kids playing, but they’re so young (I’d say ages 2-6) that when they’re left alone they often scream and shout and cry. If one of them gets upset the parent comes out to see what’s going on, but then when she goes back inside it all just starts up again. 

This happens pretty much every day and means I can’t be in that room, even with the window closed it’s too annoying. Last week I event went into another room in the apartment that’s on the opposite side and I could still hear the screaming and shouting!

I want to go over to the house where I know the kids come from to speak to the parents, and ask if they can be better supervised or possibly less noisy but I don’t know if that’s right or if it makes me an arsehole. I’m sure when I was a kid I was just as noisy, plus isn’t this just what kids do? Plus I guess it must be hard having kids (I don’t have any) so I don’t wanna give someone a hard time. On the other hand I want to say something because the noise often drives me to distraction. It’s pretty much everyday when they come home from school and almost all day during the week. I get kids can be noisy when they play but it just seems a bit selfish of the parents"	No A-holes here	0	0	6.0	5.0	0.0	0.0
c45ufa	2019-06-23 14:52:31		AITA for paying thieves to get my phone back?	"Yesterday morning I was running errands, and at some point realized that my phone was not in my shopping cart (I had it sitting face up so I could see the grocery list).  I raced home, and was presumably able to remotely lock it before they could do anything with it, and put a message on the screen saying with my husband's # and a reward to return it, no questions asked. We then tried calling and texting the phone periodically all day, but no one answered and Google's 'find my phone's function showed that the location was turned off.

The good news is that last night we finally got a call from a guy who said he 'found' it and saw that there was a reward for returning it.  I agreed, and he gave me his address to come and pick it up.  We did so (after telling my brother the address in case we never came back lol), gave him the cash, and got my phone back.

I just got it a few months ago and used versions are still $500+, so I was just happy I got it back (especially since I don't back anything up online for various paranoid reasons).  I was telling my friend about it today though, and she said I basically rewarded thievery and now the people who took it are even more likely to do this again and again.  Since they were stupid enough to give me their address (she said), I should have called the police and had them take care of it.  Even if they couldn't arrest them, it might scare them off from trying this again.  She didn't exactly call me an asshole, tbh, but she was very certain that my actions were selfish and will just cause other people to get their phones stolen."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I would like to go no contact with my dad because I genuinely believe he has had a bad influence on my life thus far. Let me give you some background: He is a poly drug abuser and has been to rehab several times to no success. He is also a sexist and a racist-- total close-minded, hateful bigot. He cheated on my mom in my youth and they argued constantly. 

For the first 16 years of my life, my dad emotionally, physically, and psychologically abused me. I was left home alone for large periods of time with him and it was like living with a giant bully in the house. He terrorized me, my mom, and my sister. Finally, my mom divorced him after 28 years after he homer-with-bart style strangled me when I punched him in the face after he attacked my mom at the dinner table. It was pretty tramatic at the time for me.

Since the incident, he has tried to mantain contact with me to varying success. It's sad because he has no friends and very little family. Not to mention, he's 64 going on 80. Turns out that drinking nonstop for 30+ years will kill you. Even worse, he has terrible mental health: he's OCD, obese, panic-anxiety, and a hypochrondric. He's also probably on the brink of death. To be honest, most of our relationship in my adult life in the past has been him pleading me to pick him up from rehab/hospital or telling me all his health issues/bowel movements. I can't stand it because I'm being used and he forces me to put my life on hold for him. When I don't do it, he shit talks me to the little family he has left and my mother.

So, WIBTA if I went no contact with him? Please help me see all sides of the story. Would it be better to just help my parent out for likely his last couple of years?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

He apologized to me. He didn't know the UAE is a country he thought it was Dubai.
He knew nothing about the middle East(he thought thought the middle east was a country).
He did some research and said sorry and he didn't mean anything he said

I am from the middle east a lived there my entire life I moved to the states for a job in Chicago and me and a couple co-workers are going to the UAE for a business trip.

I went to the Emirates before but I never lived there(I lived in Syria, Palestine, qatar,Jordan and turkey) and I am pretty sure its not as accpeting of gay people like Middle Eastern countries like Jordan,Lebanon or turkey (or even Qatar and Bahrain) and it leans more toward the Saudi side of things.

One of my coworkers is gay and very open about it. For instances when pride month starts he wears pride shirts to work and he embraces it Alot and pretty much tells everyone. I have no problem with it but I am afraid for his safety in the UAE so I told him when we go to the UAE he shouldn't tell people he is gay.

He got mad at me and called me a homophobe I told him I am looking out for him and he told me I shouldn't of trusted you people and blocked my Instagram and number and ignores me at work.

I didn't mean to offend him I was looking out for him

Edit:I am asking since I am still pretty new to American culture is this offensive for Americans?

Edit: I called my friend and told him to explain the situation to my gay friend (my gay friend doesn't wanna talk to me) I will tell you guys what he says

c45n2y	2019-06-23 14:38:11	fantafruittwistzero	AITA for not letting my neighbour into our apartment block because she forgot her key?	"I moved into gated apartments 6 weeks ago and we all have our own access key to get in. The doors require a little magnetic button that you press against the door, and it’ll open but we are told to close the doors after us each time. 

There are cameras that record people going through and there are polite bolted signs at every entrance and exit reminding people to use their own access key and not to shunt through after someone in front of you, as well as people going through MUST shut the door after entry or exit.  When I moved here and was given the walk through I was told failure to comply would result in eviction. 

I was walking into the apartments when I noticed a not immediate neighbour behind me. She had no keys in her hands, and had a LOT of Sephora/Nike/etc bags. She was huffing behind me in a way to suggest she was trying to catch up to me. I ALWAYS shut the door behind me, regardless of if there’s someone behind me or not. That’s the rules, and I’m not trying to get kicked out the apartments. so I did that this time and shut the door, and right as I reached the elevator I heard the most loud smashing behind me.

Of course I jerked around to see what was making the noise and it was woman ‘knocking’ on the door. She gestured to me to open it, and I shook my head no and said sorry and pointed to the sign where it clearly said the rules. 

I went up to my apartment and put it out my mind. This morning I saw the same lady in the foyer and she saw me and loudly started calling me an asshole for not letting her through. I told her I was sorry but that’s the rules, and she said ‘you saw I was struggling but shut the door in my face anyway’ 

I didn’t apologize again, I just left as I was already on my way to work anyhow but I feel like I might be in the wrong here."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c45lw1	2019-06-23 14:35:46	AlmostaGamer	AITA for not checking up on my dad?	"So my family situation is a little complicated. I'm not really close to my biological dad because he wasn't in my life until high school, and I had a really awesome step dad who pushed me to be the anxiety-riddled overachieving adult I am today. So step dad is Dad and bio dad is BioDad. 

You win some, you lose some. 

Anyway, my BioDad was supposed to come see me yesterday (he lives a couple hours away) but didn't say what time. So I went to the gym yesterday morning. I tried texting him before I left (10 am) and he didn't answer. I texted him during my workout (11 am) and he didn't answer. I called him from the car after (12:30 pm) and he didn't answer. Usually that's not a big deal because he's usually hard to get a hold of since we live in a rural state and cell phone service isn't that great, plus that wouldn't have been the first time he's kept me waiting all day for a response or a visit. Like, sometimes he'd say he'd be over at a certain time and then he'd be anywhere from 1-3 hours late. No big deal. 

I was a little miffed. I didn't think he forgot, but I didn't think anything would be wrong either. So I played video games all day yesterday waiting for him and I didn't call or message anyone else, like his wife (who is not my mom) to see if anything was up. I'm not that close to him, so I figured if anything was wrong, someone would tell me. 

Well.  I wake up this morning to a message from his wife saying he is in ICU on a vent. They think he had a stroke before he left the house. The neighbors found him at 1 pm, meaning I could have told someone way before then that I hadn't heard from him (remember I started texting him around 10 am). 

They say he is doing a lot better today and is on the road to a full recovery, but now I feel really bad that I wasn't more worried. Maybe they could have found him sooner if I made a bigger deal about it. I just feel really bad...

I recently started a new job at an engineering firm, been there about 1.5 mo. I'm considering starting to look for new jobs. Long story short, I left a job after 2 years because I was bored to go to a job that I am completely overwhelmed at. The team is really tiny (1 other person and a project manager) so I don't get the training or support I was promised during my interviews. 

They are absolutely swamped and so need me to be productive and a worker bee when I barely know what's going on and am stuck spinning my wheels for (billable) hours. 

I told them I had ONE year of experience which was over 2 years ago, and now I'm asked to complete work way above my pay grade. I have an anxiety disorder and bad insomnia that makes it v hard to enjoy life outside of work because I literally cannot stop thinking about work and the details of projects I'm completing. I told my manager that I'm feeling overwhelmed on my month check in, and he was generally unhelpful and referred to something (I was already using) to help. 

To be fair, he can't really do anything else because his team so understaffed and these projects need to get done, and there is no one else to do them. I dunno, I feel bad because they are obviously overloaded but I feel lied to in the interview process & wouldn't have left my previous job if I knew it would be this. I was completely transparent about my work experience in my interview, they should have known the work being requested of me right now is too advanced.

c45jrf	2019-06-23 14:31:28	starypelt	WIBTA if I complained to a barbers because they refused me service due to my gender?	"A year or so ago I moved to a small town where there is only one high quality barbers near me. Whilst I usually go to the cheap barbers (money is tight) sometimes, if I have a special event coming up, I like to have my hair cut by a higher quality barbers as I do notice the difference in my hair cut when it's done somewhere more expensive. 

I pop in to this barbers and ask to book an appointment. I'm told politely (the people working in the barbers seem nice) that they 'don't do women's hair'. This seemed odd to me because my hair is incredibly short - shorter than your average pixie cut short. It is the same length/shorter than most men's haircuts I see, and follows the classic short-on-the-sides long-on-the-top style. As such, it had never occurred to me that a barbers would have any issues with cutting my hair - especially given that I always ask for a masculine cut when I get it done. 

I thought maybe it would be best to call the barbers and complain to the relevant person and express how I would have loved to have my hair cut there and am saddened that my gender prevents me from receiving their service. However, I checked with my friends and I got a different response. Most of them reckoned that, even though my hair is a man's hair cut, there could still be a difference between how it is cut compared to a man's. Further, they didn't really think it was discrimination because, in their words, 'barbers are for men'. 

Now I'm not so sure if it's appropriate for me to call and complain - it sucks that I won't be able to get my hair cut by a high quality barbers, but I do understand that barbers are, in a traditional sense, a place for men to get their haircut. And, even if it is a kind of discrimination for them to not cut my hair, I started to wonder if complaining is just going to cause needless fuss and not really make a difference beyond making a nuisance of myself, and if it may cause trouble for the employees there, which I wouldn't want to do. 

I know this is a rather small issue compared to what this sub usually features but this event has really made me question what I thought about barbers and where I can get my hair cut and so I thought this sub would be the best place to turn to.

I'm currently in a newly developed zone where pushing the flights out is a daunting task because of how small the alley is and how close to the terminal you have to get while pushing out. The push is also an irregular one that not many people have done. 

My other coworkers have said that they are not comfortable pushing out which means I have to do it every time. 

I dont like doing it anymore than anyone else but I am able to do it. Just because I can doesnt mean I should have to. They should go back to training and learn how to push. We are three man teams that all have designated duties to accomplish in every position. 

My coworker also doesnt do other thing because she isn't comfortable doing them. And I want to tell her to find another job because what she ends up not doing gets put on other people like me causing us to have to do extra work. 

I dont mind helping out when needed but constantly having to pick up their slack is unneeded and tiresome in this line of duty.

Edit: I would talk to managers or supervisors if it would make a difference. The problem is there is no rigid structure to go up.

Debra moved to a new city about a year ago after getting a divorce.  She's had trouble meeting a new man because she only hangs out with gay men.  She goes to gay bars, gay sporting events etc.  I honestly don't get it, but hey you do you.  Well she finally met a guy and he wanted to go out on double dates.  The problem?  She's not only hanging out with gay men but hanging out with ones that like to party.  So the new boyfriend suggested she make straight friends too, she was offended by this suggestion but I honestly understood where he's coming from.  He doesn't share the same interests as her group.  I told her that and she got upset with me but we worked passed that.  This was in January of this year.  

So fast forward to this weekend.  The stonewall kick ball tournament (gay sports league) is in the city I live in.   Sure enough Debra is coming up for it as she plays and is going out to all the gay bars.  Well she asked if I could do brunch on Sunday, and I said I could if it was early.  Sure enough she makes plans for 12:45 and I have places to be at 1:30.  I asked if she  could bump them up and the response I got is ""well my gays wanted to do this time.""

I hate when she says that and I have said so before.  I still haven't responded yet, but I honestly want to respond with ""oh okay that's fine but my Asian's are meeting up later and I can't reschedule that either.""  Obviously I am not meeting up with a group of Asian's but I do have plans I can't reschedule.  

I feel like this is an ESH situation, but I will take whatever the crowd says.  If I am an asshole for it, I can see it.

Edit:  I responded that I couldn't go and that we should hang out soon one-on-one.  I will bring it up then and see if it changes.  I guess part of me is just annoyed with the entire ""fag hag"" routine."	Not the A-hole	0	0	706.0	37.0	0.0	0.0

#The relationship

Been a working with her for about a year and we became closer and closer.

For some time, we've been having sex once a week and dirty talk was appreciated from both sides. She did nothing, dirty talk or during the act, I was always doing everything and, when I talked to her about it, told me she didn't know how and let me do everything because I was better. Now, I'm a giver, I liked seeing her turned on and got off by her appreciating what I did to her. The more it went the less interested I was. She tried nothing and felt like she only wanted to receive without giving.

Fast forward to about a month ago, ~~she tells me that she's not sure anymore about doing it.~~ sorry, I spent 30 minutes arguing with her that, if there's something, she should say it. She ended up saying that she was done about it and I agreed. I didn't enjoy it that much either.

Last week, she had her prom night and had an after-party where it's know that everyone drinks alot, there's drugs everywhere and there's a hint of sex smell wherever you are.

She texted me the next morning telling me how perfect of a night it was for her and, tbh, I wasn't that interested in it so I gave a ""Damn, happy you appreciated it"". Now, she starts telling me about how she spent the entire night frenching a guy and she slept with him (like, sleeping, not anything naughty, I think). Keep in mind, she hated kissing, she said she didn't know how.

In my head, I was asking myself why the hell would she tell me that. She tells me she's done with it then go gets the first guy showing her a little bit of attention AND she's so hyped about it that she feels the need to tell me everything.

I started giving brief answers and trying to stop the conversation. She asked me if something was wrong and I told her yes.

I wanted to tell her that I really didn't need to hear how she enjoyed her night as a slut.

I ended up saying I was done and depressed. Put the blame on myself and the fact that I hate my life instead of her.

Now, she answered by continuing to tell me about him and I still was brief and trying to stop the conversation.

She tells me that she didn't need me to ruin her prom night like that and I simply said ""Yeah? Well bye then and forget me, go see your boy if you need anything.""

#The dilemma

On one side, I know it was pure jealousy, I was maybe manipulative and she owned me nothing.

On the other side, I'm realizing that she always made sure that every problem was my fault and she never did anything to contribute to the relationship, in bed or as friends.

Before anyone says it, yes it's teenager drama but I need answers on that one. I'm a terrible person generally and I do my damn best to change. Having answers on such things helps me see where I fucked up exactly."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
c45dlm	2019-06-23 14:18:59	Badriver101	AITA for refusing to ever drive a car if my mother is in it?	"Background: 
My mother has always been an anxious person and she is extremely paranoid about many aspects of life, especially when it comes to her children. I am the youngest child and usually the most tolerant so I often bear the brunt of this. One worst way it manifests is in driving - she is the worst backseat driver ever. When I first got my license, she always insisted that I am not allowed to drive alone and she would always have to accompany me (in our family car). It became very stressful for me as she would continually cry out in alarm over EVERYTHING: a large truck passing by in another lane, another car cutting in front of me, hitting a pothole etc and she would continually yell that I was going too fast or braking too hard and even grab my arm or leg while I was driving. For a long time I thought I was the worst driver ever and would be afraid and upset whenever I drove. Note, I never got into any accidents but did have a few minor scrapes (e.g. bumping into the kerb).

Fast forward to now, I have lived in several other countries for some time and driven there (road trips etc). Friends who have been with me have had no issues with my driving. I have confidence that I am not a bad driver (but neither am I the best one). Recently we went on a road trip with family and drove my aunt's car. My aunt drove the entire trip and towards the end my sister (who also has a license but hates driving) suggested I take over to give my aunt a break. I said no, and when asked why said that I would never drive with my mother in a car because she is too paranoid and I would make mistakes.

My aunt said nothing but now my sister is calling me an asshole for making my aunt drive 100% of the rather long trip and my mother is upset that I said I would never drive her anywhere even if I had a car of my own.

c45cbi	2019-06-23 14:16:22		AITA for telling off my friend who cut me off?	"We met in the beginning of freshman year. We basically hung out every day and she would always call me her best friend (even when we first met). I didn't think much of it cus I usually dgaf about sentimental things like that lol but then after a year we actually became really close. I introduced her to a friend of mine who I thought would be a good match for her and they started going out.

Within a few weeks everything changed. Texts that she would usually respond to in minutes took DAYS. Literal DAYS, the only time I don't respond to texts in DAYS is to a bitch from tinder where I'm trying to give her the hint of stop texting me.

We stopped hanging out and rarely talked. I was so confused. I thought we were ""best friends""? How the fuck do you just drop someone like that after getting close to them for a year.

This went on for MONTHS. She comes back and tells me she was dealing with depression (not even clinically diagnosed) and not saying I don't believe her but that is too convenient.

Either way, having depression is not an excuse to treat your friends like shit. I told her if I'm no longer a priority in her life then thats fine but I would rather her tell me than to play these bull shit games. 

To me it seemed like she just wanted to keep me around incase anything happened with her bf instead of treating me as an actual friend that I thought we were. I told her to fuck off and that I don't want to be friends with someone who treats their friends like shit, even if you are going thru ""depression.""

later, in a mob farm, some mobs got through the opening and started killing me. my bed was in that same room, so I kept spawning in that room and dying over and over again, without being able to do anything (my respawn screen would even break from how fast they killed me and I had to log off and log back in just to die again). the mobs didn't despawn when I left and came back and no one would be on for the day (I would continue playing for 2 more hours), and even if someone was online, he probably wouldn't be able to kill the mobs.

&#x200B;

so I decided to use cheats just to go into creative, kill the mobs, and fix the 1 block that broke (not an expensive block, just cobble) and went back to survivel. I didn't give myself anything back (other then what was on the floor from when I died).

c45bje	2019-06-23 14:14:56		WIBTA if I cut off my grandma because of her husband?	"So I moved into her house to get away from my abusive stepdad. I’ve always been a sucker for family, despite the drama. 

Her son and daughter/my uncle my mom don’t like talking to her and maintain minimal contact with her. We’ve drank and vented and it upsets her, and ever since I’ve been born I’d always do whatever I could to make my family happy. She’d claim I was the only one who was ever sweet to her, said they loved her cooking, appreciated what she did, did their chores, etc. 

But then everything changed when the HPV riddled drunk nation attacked. My grandma’s husband (who I’ll refer to as DC for Dumb Cunt). DC constantly racks up DUIs, has been caught talking to girls half his age on Facebook, constantly calls my grandma a dumb ass and treats her worse than the shit his dogs’ lay in my the yard my grandpa sacrificed his life for. 

Everything was fine until DC got off work release. My grandma cooked together, drank and vented together, got closer over the month or two I was there. 

Then my grandma changed her tone up around me once DC came back. It was constant berating and demeaning language despite my efforts around the household. Became less about our bond and more about DC’s motives who didn’t say anything to me besides asking when I’m moving out, then constant chipperness as I’ve been packing my shit up. 

I do not like to his two faced attitude she’s brought onto someone who’d do anything for her, especially putting a fucking bullet in DC’s head. I figured once I get the last of my stuff into my new place, that I won’t reply to her texts or calls, and when she asks why I’ll give my explanation when I’m ready. WIBTA for that? 

And to extend my question even further, I have despised DC even more than I have already for how he’s talked to my grandma and how poorly he’s treated her, that I think I’m going to place empty alcohol bottles in my trunk so when his parole officers come around and see it, he’s back in either work release or prison. Even with the house being empty, I don’t think I’ll go back to talking to her as she made her choice in who she rather support. WIBTA?

"I've [M28] gone on about 5 dates with this girl that I really like, but I'm not sure if it will turn into anything more serious. Because of that I don't want to share too many details with my parents so I don't get their hope's up that it will turn into something serious. I also think it's worth mentioning that I'm an only child who just moved out of their house ~7 months ago. My parents also got divorced when I was really young, but both have remarried since then so I spent almost all of my childhood living with my mother and step dad, who I have a great relationship with.


So last night I met up with my parents for dinner, and I accidentally mentioned that I was seeing a girl, but wasn't sure what will come of it. My mother naturally got all excited and started asking questions about her. I answered a few of them, then she asked what her name was and I told her I'd rather not share that just yet in case things didn't work out. She wasn't happy that I wouldn't share this and kept asking me but I didn't budge. She said I'm not going to go Facebook stalk her or anything (which I didn't believe but didn't actually say). I said that I havent told anyone other than my bestfriend her name, which is true, but she said that doesn't matter and I should tell her the girl's name. I said something along the lines of ""this is why I tell dad things and not you"", which in hindsight was probably not the right thing to say but I was getting pretty angry that she flipped out over this. She then got really angry and refused to talk to me for the rest of the meal, which was extremely awkward to say the least. 


My mother has now blocked me on Facebook and pretty much doesn't want to speak to me for the time being.


TLDR; accidentally told my mother I was dating a girl, but wasn't sure if it would become serious. Mother asked what her name was, I didn't tell her, now my mother is pissed and won't speak to me.


Edit: Since everyone is pointing out what I said to my mother (this is why I tell dad things). I agree that what I said was an asshole thing to say, and I'm not trying to defend that at all. Just to give some context, the reason i said it is because when I tell my dad things he doesn't pry, if I say I don't want to go any further, he accepts it and moves on. My mother on the other hand feels as though she's entitled to know everything and won't accept that I don't want to say anything else."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	9.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I'm in my late teens, and me and my younger sister are the kids of really hard working parents who due to that reason were barely around. I don't mind that fact, I understand it. Due to it, however, we were practically raised by our sets of grandparents, who took us in after school for weeks and weeks when our parents were busy working.  


Just today, my paternal grandma had a heart attack. It was very unexpected, because aside from recent dementia, she was physically healthy. My younger sister is in shock and very upset, which I find understandable, but because I drive and she doesn't due to her age (she's in the 14 to 16 range and our country requires 18+ for driving), she's asked me to take her to see my grandma. I denied, because the car is already with my dad, her son, and I find it unfair to see her before he does. My sister then called me heartless for 'not wanting to see a woman who practically raised us', to which I responded rather calmly that I don't think it's such a huge deal. That clearly shocked her, because she's locked herself in the bathroom and is mad at me for the response I gave.  


This grandma is also my godmother, so especially because of this, my sister is really upset that I'm so calm. I don't know why I feel so numb, but I always had a better relationship with my maternal grandparents, and plus, this grandma expressed really bigoted views before, which I suppose might've scared me off since I'm LGBT+. I also kind of feel bad in general for not being upset at all, because I can tell my little sister expected me to.

c4508x	2019-06-23 13:53:34	throwaway382884	WIBTA if my bf sleeps over my apartment on the weekends?	"I'm moving into my new apartment soon along with close friends, which includes my bestfriend and past roommate (who I'll call Jessica) We already signed the lease and we each pay by the single bedroom, not collectively, so we all are responsible for ourselves. 

My boyfriend and I have worked out an arrangement for this: I'll sleep in his dorm during the week (single room in a suite), and he'll sleep over for the weekend. This is most convenient for us (no commuting), and we like to be together anyway. We will spend most of the time in my room. 

He's social, respectful, and has gotten along with the other roommates when they met previously. What bothers me, however, is how Jessica refused to let him sleep over our dorm even once the past semester. She didn't give me a reason, only a ""No, too bad, because I said so."" I respected her refusal and told him he wasn't allowed to sleep in our room.

I was annoyed about this because she was rude to me (cursing), and secondly, her boyfriend visits our room a lot. He's slept here several times, and they always kept me up talking when I had early classes. This is a shared room, so I had nowhere else to go, couldn't sleep well, and she knew I was awake during this. She didn't want to sleep in his room when I asked so that I could actually get some sleep. Again, it was a ""because I don't want to."" 

Back to the apartment. When signing the lease, her and (let's call him James) took the two master bedrooms without asking me or the other roommate first. I know that we are not obligated to have them either, but I felt it was rude. They simply told me to ""deal with it"" when I asked about it. They don't need it for extra space as neither have a disability, they just wanted the luxury of it. Jessica has also (legally) decided to bring a pet to the apartment without our other roommates' consent, knowing that one doesn't like pets, and both could be allergic.

I'm not trying to slander the others here, and I apologize if it comes off that way, but I felt that I have been disrespected by them so far. If they are uncomfortable, I'll fix it, but again, I think it's unfair how they are not taking my opinion, and the others', into account. I know they'll have guests over as well, I'm fine with that. I am not trying to police their decisions as we pay seperately, and we're all (usually) respectful. 

We're friends, so it hurts to have them keep me out of decisions and talk to me this way. I'm not confrontational because I don't want to cause problems, and they brush me off when I do want to talk about things like this, so I'm at a loss at what to do here. I know this is long and probably petty bullshit, but I just want to know if I have a ground to stand on if my roommates complain about my boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

After nearly 7 years, I (24F) quit the contraception pill about half a year ago, because I don't have a solid reason for taking it anymore. My hormone balance is still all over the place and things are not back to normal yet. However, I feel alright and I know that this takes time (up to a year or more), so I'm trying to just be patient with my body. 

&amp;#x200B;

A big downside on this chaotic hormonal situation is the return of my teenage acne. I never had great skin even while on the pill, but I'm looking not so fresh at the moment and people notice. Oh, do they notice... It's getting to the stage where I'm actually considering starting with the pill again, which I know would put my body through even more stress. (Btw - I personally think it's no comparison to the skin I had when I was 15. Nothing I can't cover with make-up, I'm still able to leave the house)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite open about it when friends and family want to know what is up with my skin and actually expected them to be a bit supportive, but most of them get really annoying about it, especially my mother and grandmother. I'm constantly getting ""examined"" by them, like they look at me to see if it's improving or not. Although I appreciated their concern for my health in the beginning,  I now don't want them to comment on my skin at all.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I finally snapped at my grandmother when she suggested that it might be an allergy. I reminded her of the reason (me not taking the pill) for the 100th time and told her to finally shut up about it. People that have problems with their skin do know about it (surprise!!!) and don't need other people pointing it out to them a million times! I know it isn't pretty, I know it's not really improving,  I might go and see a doctor about it, but I won't die from it and just need more time! 

While in the midst of my outburst I mentioned that I'm also not constantly pointing out that her or my mother are gaining weight or wrinkles, because I would know that this is something they would feel insecure about. My grandma is now pissed and told my mom who wants me to apologize. I don't really see any reason to and decided to react like that whenever someone mentions my pimples again and again. (Honestly, it's isn't even that bad, why are people so interested in my skin???)

UPDATE: Hi everyone! Just wanted to say a quick thanks for all your answers, sorry that I can‘t respond to all of them individually!

You‘ve been all very helpful. I want to let you know that I had a good talk with both my mother and grandmother. I apologized for lashing out, but explained myself and how it makes me feel when my skin is being discussed and judged out of nowhere... as if it‘s the only and most important thing involving my person at the moment. They understand (at least they said so) and agreed to be more sensitive. I guess they were more shocked at my tone than what I said about them, as I‘m not someone who normally argues and gets loud. Especially not to my grandma (I love her a lot, but she can get annoying, man...).

I‘m also trying some products now (salicylic acid, niacinamide, a good face wash from Kiehl‘s and zinc tablets) and hope it will get better soon. If not, I will see a doc! So thank you all for your recommendations and advice!"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c44rh6	2019-06-23 13:36:25		WIBTA for skipping bachelorette thing because I don't think it's worth the plane time or money, but it's important to the bride, who is a sweetheart?	"My friend is getting married and she's a doll. And her husband is a doll! No problems with them. But there are a ton of obligations with this and I'm getting kind of tired of them. I'm thinking of skipping the bachelorette party even though it's a big deal they've been planning.  But it would hurt the bride, who I just love. 

I legit don't know if this would make me an asshole. 

The latest obligation is to go to the this mixed genders party and it's a reasonable ask since I'm in the wedding party and she's an old friend. She used to teach me!  But it's expensive, and for me it's a crap ton of travel, like fully 4 days, which is sort of fine timewise since I have a couple of weeks. It's just a lot of sitting in planes and airports. 

It's pricey, too, and takes a chunk out of the tuition money (for a specialization in my trade, not a huge program; I can remake it) I'm saving. One of the groomsmen offered to pay my way but like no, that's just an enormous obligation I don't want. (not in a sexual way, his family are old family friends) I hate owing anyone anything. Anyway, I can afford it if I scrape a bit so I can't plead poverty. 

I just don't wanna spend the money tbh. 

I've done a fair amount for this couple wedding-wise and otherwise, but they've done a lot for me, too, over the years. The emotional balance sheet there is even (?)*  but I think me skipping this event would put me drastically in the red. 

*No, this isn't accurate, they've done more for me: jobs, setting me up with boatbois, like just kindness about parents and stuff. Trying to be accurate for asshole assessment. They do more; I owe them. 

And I like the bride a lot even if she the worst bridezilla on earth right now. I'm so happy for her and this guy is an awesome dork. She makes me laugh and that's just the world. And my absence would be felt, which sounds like a weird flex, sorry. I just mean it would be pretty weird if I'm not there. Plus they need one girl [usually me] to hold back hair, make sure no vagina pics make it to Instagram, and just generally get people on planes.

The party itself promises a lot of stripper dongs and cheese. I'm opposed to neither but I also don't want to travel and spend $$$$ to see them. But I think it's more than that. I think it would hurt the bride for me to skip it and even the thought of hurting her makes me wanna cry a little bit, so maybe that's worth the time and money to travel."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c44qnb	2019-06-23 13:34:45	nbstories	AITA for ordering a vegan burger for my boyfriend?	"UPDATE (scroll down for original post):

Wow, this blew up! Firstly, I wanted to address a couple of comments:

1. He doesn't have any allergies - obviously I wouldn't have ordered the burger if there was a chance it might cause him harm.

2. This isn't part of some grand scheme to turn him vegan. I respect his right to eat meat, and I don't bother him about this. In fact, he's generally the only one to bring up my veganism (usually in the context of making fun of my food, which can get pretty exhausting).

Anyway, after reading lots of the comments I apologised for giving him vegan food without asking for permission. He said I should apologise for making him look like an idiot by letting him brag about the ""beef"" burger when I knew it was fake. I said I was sorry about that, but also mentioned that he doesn't make me feel great when he makes fun of my food all the time. He's seen the message but he hasn't replied, I'm honestly kind of pissed off but I'll wait and see what he says.


ORIGINAL POST:

I really don’t think I’m the asshole here, but his friends are saying I am so I wanted to get some opinions.

I’ve been a vegan for the past 2 years, whereas my boyfriend is adamant that he would never give up meat. He always complains about how vegan food doesn’t taste as good, isn’t filling etc, and he’s normally not willing to try new things.

Anyway, last night we were on a date at a burger chain. The chain lets you order with an app. He was busy on his phone and told me to order for him, and he wanted a beef burger. I asked which one and he said “I’m busy, you choose.”

I noticed that the restaurant sold the Beyond Burger - if you don’t know, it’s a kind of “fake meat” burger which is designed to be realistic. I’ve heard it’s actually really similar to meat, so I order him one mostly out of interest to see if he’d notice. I got myself a bean burger, so he wouldn’t notice we had the same meal and get suspicious.
The meal arrives and he really loves it! I kept subtly asking him how it was and he said it was great! He even boasted about it being tastier than my “lame” veggie burger.

After we’d paid up, I told him the truth and he was pissed, saying I tricked him and violated his trust etc. But he loved the burger?? I think he’s just feeling sensitive about being proven wrong, but he asked his friends and they’re saying I’m trying to control his diet and stuff. So AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	6.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
c44o7y	2019-06-23 13:29:58		AITA for cutting my friend of 4 years out of my life?	"I'll try to keep this short. But it's a kinda long story so please read. I met this friend, let's call her Lisa, in the first week of high school and we were close friends since then. It has been 4 years now and 8 days ago, we had our uni exams. Since it was our last year we didn't go to school for last 2-3 months and studied at home for this exam. Meanwhile, Lisa and i met to see Infinity war, and didn't really talked much after that. Just text messages and calls every now and then. 

About 2 months ago, Lisa started ignoring my messages. I texted her like 1-2 times a week and since both of us were very busy, i didn't think she did this on purpose first. But then she didn't even reply to my important texts so i texted her ""what's wrong?"" and she said she didn't want to talk to me. I decided to call her but she was just ignoring all my calls and it continued until yesterday.

I woke up to see her messages. She said that she got sick (didn't tell me what it was but from what i heard from a friend, i think it's about hearing and not permanent) and i didn't call her so i'm not a true friend and she doesn't want to speak to me again. I asked her when did that happen, she said 1 week before she started ignoring my texts. 

In this time, i've been through some bad stuff too. And she never called me either. But, i didn't get mad at her at all and tried to explain i was sorry i didn't call her sooner, i wanted to make it up to her and we texted for half an hour. She said i was selfish because i'll go to another city to work this summer and i won't spend it here so i won't be meeting her. And finally, as if she was talking to a bitch, she said ""I know why. Because your boyfriend is enough to satisfy you!"" And at that point i said ""That's enough. I really don't want to talk to you again.""

We were close, but she made it clear to me that her other friends were ""closer"" and it's not like we were calling each other very often. If i knew she was sick, i'd definitely call her. But she didn't even pick up my calls because i called her one week after that.

Thing is, last year Lisa was the one who found me literally SCREAMING from pain alone in my class because of a problem in my back. After that, i didn't go to school, had physiotherapy for a month. Guess who never called me? I'm repeating she was the one who saw me like that. I didn't even know that she was sick. She is being too self-centered imo. Still, AITA?"

c44m3m	2019-06-23 13:25:39	kinabatangan	AITA for how I've treated my friend?	"2 weeks ago I asked my friend about her part time job as a personal chef. At one time she told me she was looking for other opportunities, so I asked her how the job was going, and offered to take her place if she ever left. When I've left jobs in the past I've always worried about hurting my relationship with my boss so I thought this was a relatively kind gesture. Her whole tone over text was so off-putting and she basically said the job would be too complex for me to handle. She sent the last text.

I didn't feel like continuing the conversation, so no conversation happened between us for almost 2 weeks. Anyway, I sent a text this morning apologizing if I annoyed her. She misconstrued the whole situation and thought I was trying to take her job. She interpreted the lack of contact after that conversation as me ""using"" her, because she thought I had no ""use"" for her after she turned me down for the job. She seemed mad that I didn't text her after that conversation. I initiate most of our conversations, so I was curious to see if she would for once.

Then, she brought up that she feels used because whenever we go hiking, which has only been a handful of times, she's always the one to drive. We come from the same direction and will meet up at a location halfway there, and then she'll drive us the rest of the way. I've offered to take us a couple times but she seemed like she wanted to drive. I had/have no issue taking us places, but she never communicated that she wanted me to.

I just think she's blowing this out of proportion. I apologized and explained everything from my perspective. I haven't heard back from her and I don't know if I will."	No A-holes here	0	0	66.0	90.0	0.0	0.0

c44cya	2019-06-23 13:06:45		AITA for feeling so upset over my mom eating/giving away my food? (F25, F 55)	"Sorry if English isn't perfect! 
Recently I've been diagnosed with a disease that has basically transformed my diet. From someone who ate mostly junk food every day, I've been put on a very strict diet now. I'll be honest and admit that I am finding the change quite difficult but sucking it up for treatment. 

On two separate occasions, my friends while coming to visit me have made some healthy food that's also tasty knowing I'm having a hard time adjusting. On the first occassion, my mom gave away a significant portion of the food saying there's ""no place to keep it"", and on the second occasion, fed food brought for me to the rest of the family and ate the rest. (I probably got one piece). I was also told by my friend that she asked her not to bother herself and bring any more because my mom ""knows how to make it"". (She definitely doesn't)

Today I woke up and saw that a packet of snacks (amongst the only snacks I'm allowed to eat) cooked and abandoned after a few small bites. Last two evenings, when I made this snack for myself, I ensured I made it only when she was around so we could split half knowing how much she likes it. 

I woke up and asked her why she made the entire packet if she was only going to eat 1/3rd of it, and she said it's because ""she could share it with me"". But this wasn't accurate as it was hidden away and I only chanced upon it as I was looking for my usual plate. Also, I'm not allowed to eat the snacks or two days before treatment, and given that I ate it two days consecutively, I can only eat it as a treat again maybe a week later. 

The illness has been a bummer tbh and the diet is making me kinda grumpyz but I'm doing my best to be pleasant and normal. I just want to know if I'm being really critical and mean (I haven't and won't say anything to her) or if it's alright for me to feel this hurt about it. Mom and dad are paying for all the food wnd everything if that matters but it's pretty customary in my country.

c44bil	2019-06-23 13:03:49	So_Ill_Continue	AITA for (over)valuing the way my family argues?	"EDIT: Just to be clear, I know I should help out more, but I was just using that argument as an example. I just wanted to pick something that she was right about to demonstrate my point without biasing ppl against her. So me helping/not helping isn't what this post is about.

This situation is a bit difficult to describe, but I'll do my best.

Personality-wise, my family is sort of split. My mom and I (21F) are alike and so are my sister ""S"" (25) and my dad. We often have arguments about communication. My dad and S are all about the ***truth*** of statements - ""the truth shall set me free"" type. This means they can be very blunt so long as ***they*** believe what they're saying is true.

My mom and I also value honesty. However, we think ***how*** you say something is equally important.

EX: if S and I are arguing about helping out around the house (when we visit home):

**S**: You're being lazy and selfish.

**Me:** I know I can often be lazy and that you help out a lot more than I do. But I don't appreciate you acting like you're my mom. If Mom or Dad have a problem with me, they can come to be about it. *(as opposed to saying that she's being overbearing, demanding and rude)* And could you please not insult me? It hurts my feelings and makes it difficult for us to have a good conversation.

**S:** Well it's the truth and I shouldn't have to sugarcoat it because you're sensitive. And if I don't tell you to help then no one will and you'll never do anything.

**Me** ***(getting upset)*****:** I disagree, and I'm not sensitive, but when I'm being insulted I'm going to get mad and upset.

**S:** You already admitted that you're lazy, so you shouldn't be mad because you agreed it was the truth. Can we get back on topic?

**Me:** No, because if you're going to argue this way I don't want to talk to you.

IMO you should talk to someone with the goal of good communication and, at least in this context, changing their mind. For both of these goals you need to respect the person and show that respect in how you talk with them. S, however, insists that this is all BS and that I need to control my emotions and focus on the meaning/truth of what is said rather than ""lying."" I argue that (1) ""controlling your emotions"" (as opposed to your behavior and/or reaction to your emotions) isn't possible, (2) she can't expect me to not get mad/upset if she insults me, (3) it is 100% possible to tell the truth respectfully, and (4) what you take to be a truth can often be subjective (for everyone, not just S).

My mom frequently has similar arguments with my dad, and sometimes I do with him as well. Both S and my dad now get angry when my mom or I bring the subject of communication up (which to be fair is typically in the middle of other arguments, although that's kind of by necessity), which makes it hard to discuss/argue about *anything*.

On the other hand, I can't help but think that maybe I'm just being an entitled douche and need to focus more on what they're saying and why. AITA for getting hung up on the way things are communicated and getting upset/insulted otherwise?

(I realize S/my dad's way of arguing is very common. But I'm asking if asking to argue differently/getting hurt when they don't and continue insulting is reasonable)."	No A-holes here	0	0	120.0	8.0	0.0	0.0

c4484n	2019-06-23 12:57:08	springfieldproud	AITA for calling out a gentrifier?	"The other day my friends and I went to a new-to-us bar, let’s say we live in Springfield. This particular bar is located in East Springfield. Out of ~12 people in our group only 1 lives and works in East Springfield. She was the one who suggested the bar. She works in the service industry like many people in East Springfield.

East Springfield is historically a grungy neighborhood but it’s well known for having cool bars and restaurants. Downtown Springfield also has nightlife, but it’s filled with tourists and is more expensive, so young people often go out in East Springfield instead. East Springfield is rapidly gentrifying, so the artists and lower wage earners who live there are being pushed out. These are the people who staff the bars, restaurants, and shops all around town, and make Springfield a cool place that tourists want to visit and locals feel proud to live in. It bothers me a lot, even though I live in West Springfield and have a yuppie job.

One of the people in the group, Karen, is in her late 30s, lives in North Springfield, works a yuppie job downtown, and is a relatively recent transplant from out of state. She seemed happy enough at the bar that night and was gushing over the craft cocktails. A few nights later, however, Karen complained that she hated the bar. I probably should have held my tongue but I asked why. She said that it was “very East Springfield.” One of her complaints was that she didn’t like the crowd there and how a lot of people were smoking outside. I hate smoking too and was congested all night because of the secondhand smoke, but the bar is a local bar catering to locals living in the surrounding neighborhood. (In Springfield, you’re pretty much either a locals bar or a tourist bar. If you Google this bar, you’ll find interviews with the owners saying that their foremost goal is to appeal to local residents and become a neighborhood hangout.) I told Karen that we may not like the place or ever go back, but it wasn’t fair of us to go to East Springfield and then complain when bars there cater to people living there. I told her I was worried that East Springfield was going to become “downtown-ified” and she got really defensive and said she didn’t want it to become downtownified, she just didn’t like the bar or the crowd. She then compared it to another East Springfield dive bar that she recently went to and had dissed in the group chat along similar lines.

She didn’t take it well so now I’m wondering AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c4472y	2019-06-23 12:54:48	0utOfT1me	AITA for telling my gf the truth about a present for her bf?	"My gf was looking for a birthday present for her best friend. They are \*really\* close, so it had to be something special. My gf found out about so called ""star christening"". They are offered by private companies, which basically name a star as you wish and mail you a ""certificate"" ""proving"" it. Now I was thinking about that as a gift for my mother many years back,had researched it and found out that all these companies don't have any official authority to actually give a star a certain name. Basically they sells you just the piece of paper. I could do that with photoshop and it would have exactly the same ""worth"" or ""authority"" as the certificates from these companies.

Since she asked me about my opinion on the gift, I asked her how much it was: 80€! For 20-30€ I wouldn't have said anything but 80€ for literally a piece of paper (that wasn't even well designed) is just a total rip-off in my opinion. I told her how these companies don't have any authority, providing her with sources for this information and that her gift was basically just a piece of paper. I also told her that I really appreciate the gesture and thinks it's a very cute present in theory but that I'd rather buy something they could enjoy together such as concert tickets for those 80€. I also told her that if she really wanted to get such a certificate, she has every right and that it was just my opinion. I also said that I understand that presents don't have to be practically useful (such as concert tickets) if they have some emotional value or meaning. Still this was just a piece of paper and not some sort of actually beautiful physical artifact such as a snow globe with the star's ""name"" in it or something.

Anyway she got really pissed and told me that I ""destroyed"" her present, that I should just shut up and she hated ""this side"" of me...

For context: This was several months before her bf's birthday so there was more than enough time to get a different present, if she decided to. Also she hadn't bought it yet.

c4470z	2019-06-23 12:54:41	tightywalterwhiteys	AITA for being upset my girlfriend invited her family to our flat?	" I (F24) and my girlfriend (F25) live in a small flat. This morning my girlfriend was going to go out with her sister (F22) and her sister's boyfriend (M30ish) to walk their dog. I love dogs but this one has behavioural issues, specifically peeing indoors and being needy (i.e. she licks or bites people when not being fussed/stroked) - this bugs me but I think it's influenced by how I feel about my girlfriend's sister.

She's not mean or intentionally rude to me, I find her relatively easy to get along with but I often find her to be quite a ""debbie downer"". She is very critical of other people, her and her boyfriend argue constantly and it makes me feel uncomfortable. We have never argued, I keep my distance and my girlfriend understands how I feel - therefore I don't go on these walks and try to restrict time seeing her unless it's a family gathering, otherwise I aim to stay polite but distant.

Anyway here's where I fear I'm acting like an arsehole - before girlfriend's sister came along today I established whether they would head up to our flat so I knew whether to get up early and shower. I was told no, but shortly after my girlfriend went down to meet them, she returns and walks through the door with dog, sister and sister's boyfriend in tow and they all descend into the living room with happy ""Hello!"" ""What time do you call this then?"".

I was sat with short pyjamas on, bedhead and hairy legs etc., having woke up about 10 minutes ago. I said hello as I ran to the bathroom to jump in the shower, feeling embarrassed and a bit harassed - I like my personal space, I don't like unexpected visits when I stink and I just felt a bit off guard.

After the shower, I walk across to the bedroom and close the door, shouting ""bathroom's free"" - girlfriend's sister walked to the bathroom and shouted ""finally!"". My girlfriend came and knocked on the door but I wanted to get changed alone, I just said ""I'll see you later - just getting dressed"". There's some faffing around outside in the hallway and I hear them leave, my girlfriend has since text me ""She wanted to use the bathroom, what did you expect me to do?!?!?"" so I'm sat waiting until the evening so we can chat, I can't decide to what extent I've fucked up here.

I feel embarrassed that I practically legged it to the bathroom and feel I could have wrapped myself up in one of the throw blankets but at the same time, I think her sister needing the loo doesn't explain why everyone had to come up to the flat when she knew I was sat practically tits out on the sofa with a cup of tea - even just a forewarning as she opened the front door would have been nice. We don't have a lot of space where I could have gone in our little flat (like an upstairs) and I don't like having the dog around as her sister just refuses to address her behaviour and chastises you if you try.

c445so	2019-06-23 12:52:00	blueberrycheesesteak	WIBTA if we got a private room on a family holiday?	"My boyfriend and I (19m/f) are on a paid for by his auntie and mother. I know that this may immediately seem like we’re the assholes, but please read

My boyfriend and I were relegated to the smallest and worst room because we are the youngest, and in his worst, his family are “scared of my sister.” We are the only people to not have direct access to a bathroom plus our bed is just two single beds pressed together.
- This isn’t an issue, if I hadn’t watched the auntie purposefully change the rooms so that her sons would get the best rooms - due to flight delays my boyfriend and his sister arrived late, and the sister got the better room because they were afraid she would be angry. My boyfriends auntie pushed the beds together in order to present it like a double bed. The issue comes from the deceit of the auntie in order to get her boys what they want. I’m a guest, I don’t want to say anything, because this isn’t my house, but my boyfriend is hurt because he feels he has been treated completely unfairly. To add to the drama of the rooms, there is a separate room with a double bed that we could have taken, but because of the biased auntie, her single son took the double bed.

My boyfriends sister and her partner got a very private room with an en-suite. I quietly asked the auntie for this room - my reasons were genuinely fair - I have a huge, huge snoring problem which often keeps my boyfriend up. The room that we have, has three doors on three walls, and one window. Two of these doors border on the main communal area outside, where some of the older cousins stay up quite late. Our room directly borders the aunties, and there is a door to walk through in which we enter her room. On top of this, my boyfriend and I both struggle to sleep so I politely asked for the more private room because I was afraid we would keep the others awake. She said no on the basis that the sister “might have her period” Additionally, my partner and I are in a long distance relationship - we don’t get to see each other and we are now stuck in a room with absolutely no privacy (I can hear whispered conversations). After asking, I politely accepted the room

My partner approached his sister and asked her if halfway through the six day holiday, we could have the more private room. She immediately laughed in his face and pretty much told him to fuck off. 

I know how ungrateful I/we must sound, but we am really just absolutely begging for some privacy with each other. We absolutely cannot do anything remotely intimate because of the lack of privacy, and we can barely even have a conversation. We have both bought up the idea of getting an air bnb to stay at just for some privacy. 

Also, we would absolutely still do everything with the group. The air bnb would exist solely for our own privacy for a few nights, not the entire holiday, because we genuinely have absolute none where we our (our doors are  made of glass and covered by a thin sheet)."

Saturday, I asked if her and I could just hang out, get dinner and have girl time. She said she wasn’t sure, because she had something else going on. I got in my head, overthought everything, and said “Sorry, I should have asked if you already had plans with [my SO.]” She ignored me, which I deserved.

Later, she confirmed she couldn’t hang out. I told my SO, and he said “yeah, she’s getting her divorce papers together today.”

Definitely a good reason to be busy, and I feel like a bitch for being passive aggressive.

At the same time, I’m pretty hurt she told my SO and not me. I guess she didn’t want to by Facebook message. I’m probably just overthinking things again, but it still feels like she prefers his company over mine. They were friends before we started dating, so it’s not that weird. I just feel left out and jealous. She’s my only friend, my SO has a ton of others. 

But she’s getting a divorce and it shouldn’t be about me. I want to help her through this rough time, but I guess I’m not even sure if she wants me to... or, if she does, if I’ll be able to without being a terrible person.

Last night thinking about it, I begged for death. I don’t think I deserve to be her friend or even live. I’m so tired of being awful.

I know I’m TA. I just want to be called out on it. I need to hear it so maybe I’ll stop being such a trash human."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c441yx	2019-06-23 12:43:53	TruePolymorphed	AITA for Not Helping my Dad?	"About two days ago my mother mentioned that my dad,  who is currently going through chemo,  is replacing the ceiling in their hallway this weekend. She expressed concern that he was going to hurt himself, and frustration that he didn't want to work with others (since becoming sick my dad has become very snappy). I agreed with her,  saying he probably shouldn't do it by himself. I told her to let me know if she could get him to accept my help. 





Fast forward to Saturday,  and I still haven't heard anything. I don't know what day this weekend or what time,  whether he would accept my help,  ect. I assume they don't need me. I'm not feeling great anyway,  I was up all night with a stomach ache the night before. Then I see a post on Facebook at about 3pm showing my dad working on the ceiling. I make a comment to the effect of ""guess he didn't want my help."" my mother replies ""oh he never said for sure either way."" okay,  first I'm hearing of this,  and its not a real answer anyway. I say that i hope he's being careful and resting and leave it at that. 





About two hours later I get a text from my mom saying ""I thought you were just going to show up?"" At this point I'm irritated,  and just reply ""nope."" This is a fight my mom and I have had before. I've told her that I think its polite to give date,  time,  and actually ask for help. It is not appropriate to expect people to just show up whenever you're doing something. She goes off on me. Says that she ""hopes I can live with myself when my father dies."" and that ""She doesn't know how she ended up with a daughter who is so incredibly selfish"",  and that ""I should go back to therapy and learn empathy."" I didn't reply to that,  and haven't heard from her since. 





 As background:  I have been in therapy in the past due to an anxiety disorder. My anxiety stems from the desire to do what I'm supposed to,  and that everyone is hiding what they want so that I can't do it right. When I worry about being wrong,  i'm terrified that wrong behavior will result in extreme name calling and lengthy silent treatments. My therapist strongly suggested that my mother was a big reason I am the way I am. 






So my question is,  AITA here? I'm not opposed to helping my father,  but I don't want to show up to find out its not happening today,  or that he doesn't want my help. Besides,  I get irritated that my mother (who is in her early forties and healthy) didn't offer to help my dad if it was so bad. Instead I'm supposed to make the hour drive down with two days notice."	Not the A-hole	0	0	181.0	12.0	0.0	0.0
c441wf	2019-06-23 12:43:43	Mymovieisahorrorshow	WIBTA if I quit the independent movie I'm directing? Worst case I strand the cast and crew in the middle of New Mexico and my family loses money. Best case I don't go insane.	"It's always been my dream to be a film director. Two years ago I basically was inspired by Christopher McCandless and did a solo trip across the US and Mexico. In a tiny little town on the border I met this old guy named ""Birdman"" who's life story was so fascinating I wrote a screenplay based on his life freehand in about a week. 

It took me two years but I took out tons of credit cards, my family invested an so actually have a few hundred thousand to work with. We are presently shooting across New Mexico and  I have a somewhat professional film crew, actors and film equipment I've rented. It's cost a fortune and at this point we are so over budget it's not even funny. 

Well I'm realizing now ""Birdman"" is a fucking liar. And almost nothing he told me two years ago happened. He insisted on playing himself which I agreed to but he argues with me about the way things happened and whether things happened (for example he claimed he was in the first Iraq war and won the Medal of Honor, truth he wasn't even in the military).  He has almost zero camera presence so I have to carefully ""shoot around"" him even though he's the focus of the movie. He also ""accidentally"" walked in our lead actress changing several times so she quit (reshoots=$$$) and now her replacement is probably sleeping with Birdman creating more potential drama when he pisses her off. 

This morning is typical. We were supposed to start at 3AM so we could get establishing shots of the sunrise over the mountains. Birdman got everyone drunk last night (all his pay, he's going to want an advance when I see him) and no one showed up. We lost a morning or shooting and I still have to pay for food and hotels for today. Like I said, typical for this shoot.

I want DD the cast and crews pay up to today, take my credit card off the hotel and just drive the fuck away today. I'm so frustrated. I can give my family back whatever money of thiers is left and say I'm sorry for the loss and I can look into bankruptcy for the credit cards. I can't bear the thought of dealing with these people again.

c440l1	2019-06-23 12:40:59		AITA for disliking my cousin who I live and work with?	"I'm about 2 months into my new job and living in Colorad with my uncle when, my uncles son [M,29] calls my uncle and says he's just been fired and needs a new place to live. So, of course my uncle says ""ok we have an extra room you can rent you just need to get a job here and start paying the rent for the room"". Being the person I am I tell my cousin he can use my car as he needs (me and his dad work together so we car pool every day in his dad's car), well after a momth my cousin finds a job. So, my cousin has found a job to pay all his bills finally but I'm not going to charge him for using my car I mean, hes family after all. Well after about 2 months I tell him, you need to start saving up for a car of your own so, you don't have to use mine. He then opens up to me that he moved to Colorado with $7,000 in his bank account (I only make 2 grand a month) and he blew it all on partying and gambling the first month. But, being the idiot I am I ignored it and let him continue to use my car to get to work and back. After about 4 months into his job he comes home one day and says he quit his job in the middle of his shift. My cousin didn't like the way his employers were treating him he says. All that money he had saved up for the car he was supposed to buy, he used to pay his rent and what not for that month instead of getting his car. After having no job for a month my uncle managed to land him a guaranteed job at our company on my shift so, we work every day together (I hated my uncle for this so much and, told him so). After the 6 months of living with my cousin I already know, I don't like the person my cousin is. My cousin constantly lectures me about how grown up he is and that maybe one day I'll get to his level (while driving in my car), he tells me about these dreams he has about our deceased grandfather telling him to take care of our family. On the way home from work today, in my car, he had the audacity to say me and his dad are both snakes. After he said this I was just extremely surprised, I said ""ooooookkkkkk can you give me an example of this""? He says ""no I can't, you guys just talk amongst yourselves"". I said ""so, me and your dad have me and your dad problems with each other and, we discuss it amongst ourselves and that makes us snakes"" (we borrow money from each other and discuss it amongst just us)? My cousin says ""yes, I had a dream last night that one of you were outside of my door just sitting there talking and that proves it"". So, honestly I'm not too sure how much more of my cousin I can take. I'm not sure if he has mental problems, is delusional or, what. What I want to know is, AITA if I decide to totally cut my cousin out of my life even though I live and work with him. I'm ready to tell him find his own way to work and home every day, I want nothing to do with him and I honestly don't want to be around him at all."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"My friend set me up with this guy who’s one of his closest friends. He told me his friend was Muslim but he was really cute and my friend figured we’d hit it off despite slight religious/ cultural differences. We’ve been talking for a week now and last night we met in person. 

One of the conversations we had was about halal/ eating pork/ drinking alcohol. Whilst he doesn’t eat pork at all, he drinks alcohol and eats McDonald’s/ shake shack/ whatever. When I asked him why he doesn’t eat pork he just told me it’s personal preference NOT that he avoids it for religious reasons. 

I am really into this guy and wanted to make an amazing first impression, so figured I’d make one of my go to all out meals that *everyone* loves which was slow cooked bourbon pork butt sliders with a homemade slaw. 

When he came over it was amazing, he was cute, funny, and really chill. He drank the beer I offered him, and when we sat down to eat I told him that we’d be having bourbon sliders. I didn’t mention it was pork because in our conversations he told me that he’d never intentionally eaten it before but if he did he didn’t think he’d like it so I didn’t want him to be biased. 

After he took a couple bites he looked at me with a really pissed off face and asked if it was pork. I said yes, and he just spat out his mouthful into a napkin and in a really angry voice said that he thought he’d told me he didn’t eat pork. I told him that I thought I’d change his mind and he said that wasnt a cool thing for me to do. 

He left very quickly after and I was so upset I called my friend who initially set us up. He was really pissed at me even though I defended myself on the phone and said that a) my date drank alcohol and didn’t eat halal anyway so how I was meant to know that he took not eating pork seriously and b) he didn’t make it clear he avoided pork for religious reasons. 

All my guy friends have texted me today saying variants of ‘yo that was mad dumb of you lmao’ etc and I just feel really upset about the whole thing."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c43t35	2019-06-23 12:24:54		AITA: For telling a co-worker he should have a witness when he plays our office lottery game because he wins more often then most?	"I’m pretty sure I’m going to be deemed an TAH but let’s see: 

I run the office snack shop (we work in a 24 hour operation and no restaurants/coffee shops nearby). I stock items, charge a small markup and the profit goes towards our annual xmas office gifts etc. I do not make any personal profit and I do not benefit in any way. I’ve introduced a new game to keep things fun where every time employees purchase their 7th item they pull a ticket out of a hat and if the ticket has a prize (something from the snack shop). I made it so the odds are winning are about 45%. There is no formal rules about pulling the ticket. You buy your seventh item and pull the ticket if you win something great grab the item and put the ticket back in the hat etc. 

This has been a hit in the office and sales are up which is a good thing for the group.  I have one co-worker lets call him “Frank” who kept winning items more often than most. He is honest and I do not have any doubt anything shady is going on. I as a joke said to him “Next time you pull a ticket you’re going to need a security camera and a witness”. This is my brand of humor and I would have said it to anyone in the office who had his luck, in fact I may have said the same joke once or twice more with different people who won a free item and the joke was received well. Our office culture is also one where we openly razz each other (literally 5 mins ago I got a racist joke thrown my way and I went with it). Frank and I have had many shifts together and we have a great working relationship.  The day I made the joke he remarked that he isn’t doing THAT bad and I said “I know I know I’m just joking”. He is a family man with a history of debt and money is always on his mind so here is where I made my mistake and struck a nerve. 

Since then Frank and I some good shifts together and this topic didn’t come up, I took as this being non-issue and I never said the same joke or anything similar to him again. Well this morning, he was coming off a night shift and as he was leaving the office he sharked to me how he needs a witness and a camera from now on he isn’t buying anything else from the snack shop, he was clearly miffed. I see him again in a few days and I intend to apologize. I understand I unintentionally struck a nerve and I’m willing to man up about it. 

A part of me thinks that he is took this joke too seriously, as a room we throw harsher jokes at each other all the time, or the night shift is impacting him harder than usual. What do you say people? AITA? Should I apologize or am I NTA and I should let him figure that a joke is a joke and not everything is an attack on his personal life?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I am the eldest sibling in my family. I know my mom had a miscarriage before my birth. Other than the fact that it happened, I don't know anything about it, and my parents never talk about it. I know my parents had a name picked out for me which they changed just before my birth, and lately I've been curious if this was the name my ""older brother"" would have had, if it was even a boy. Did they know the gender? Was any of my stuff as a child purchased for this kid who never was?

&#x200B;

Really I'm just kind of curious about it and about how it affected my parents, but it seems to me this may be a pretty sensitive topic and not worth asking about.

I told her then that I would be writing an important math exam the next day and that I probably needed to study cause I dont really understand the topic and she replied with her usual ""it could be his last birthday."" ""He doesn't has that much time anymore."" Which might be true, but the thing is my grandfather and I never have been close and in the state he is right now talking to him is really hard.(He doesn't seem to listen and when he talkes it's just gibberish) So everytime we get there all I to is sit there and wait till we drive back home. 
That's the reason I dont visit him alone, because I would be much more comfortable with that, because I dont really get along with my mother and sister. I currently live with my dad (my parents are divorced) due to us not getting along at all and some mental health issues I developed from that. 
When my sister call a few minutes ago and I told her that I'm not coming because I need to study, she just said ""I dont believe you."" I hung up immediately after that. She managed to make me so angry by saying just one sentence and I'm honestly really happy I don't have to be around those two every day anymore.
 I really feel bad for not going but I know that it will be a waste of time that I dont have right now.

c43fzs	2019-06-23 11:56:43		AITA for refusing to pitch in on a drunk purchase?	"I'm currently on my university's study abroad program, and six people who I met at the program invited me to go on a weekend trip with them to Munich, Germany. It turns out that three of my close friends on the program were also going to Munich that same weekend and booked out an Airbnb there. Both groups ended up on the same train, and we all decided it'd be cool if we all travelled together, as their Airbnb wasn't too far away from the hotel my group and I were staying at. 


Fast forward a little bit to a Saturday night, everyone decided to meet up at a bar to have drinks. Everyone was enjoying the night, and when it was a little past midnight, my three close friends and I split off from the rest of the group to go to a nearby strip club (of course, we let everyone else know where we were going, just in case). My friends and I were pretty drunk when we left the club but definitely not drunk enough to black out. When we arrive at the bar, the rest of the group is extremely intoxicated. All of them seemed like they were having a really fun night and told me and my close friends that they had gone out to get KFC, which everyone had a good laugh about. The night ends with everyone having a blast and my close friends making it back to their Airbnb just fine.


The next morning, one of the girls I was traveling with, let's call her Megan, said that I owed her money for the KFC from last night. I laughed and said that I never got KFC with them and that I was with my friends at the strip club. She denied this and insisted that I was with them and had some of their KFC. I continued to tell them that I was never even with them, and I obviously trust my own memory more than theirs, as I was not nearly as drunk as they were last night, not by a long shot. Megan then insisted that even if I wasn't there, that I should pitch in on the money they spent, which came out to be about $6. Despite it being a small amount of money, I told her that it's absurd that they would even suggest that I owe them money for something I wasn't even remotely involved in. Megan continues and says that it didn't matter, and because we were all having a good time, all the costs should be evenly split. I refused. I can understand pitching in for a bunch of drinks that someone else bought, which I did, but this was something completely different. After that, Megan got very irritated and reluctantly accepted that I wouldn't have to pitch in anymore, calling me a bitch for not paying. However, this wasn't about the money, I could've easily paid, but I won't pay for something I didn't buy, let alone even get involved in. A few others in the group are telling me that I'm TA and should've just paid the money anyway to avoid damaging the friendship everyone developed this weekend. Frankly, I don't give a damn if you're Jesus Christ himself. I'm not paying you money I don't owe you, regardless of the amount.

c43d2b	2019-06-23 11:50:04	LOLDonkaments187	"AITA for confronting my GF about her tolerance of ""borderline racist"" remarks from her Ex-BF?"	"Hello!

&#x200B;

I (M/34) live in Germany (big city) and have been born and raised in Germany. My parents are turkish guest workers who came here in the 1970s - so my heritage (just like my name, my looks etc) is turkish ;) In my opionion I feel ""german"" and Germany is the only country in the world i would call ""home”.

For 5 months I’m dating my new GF (29/F) - we get along pretty fine.

But some of her “views” and behaviours confuse me and piss me off. For further explanation: My Girlfriend was born and raised in the city we live in and always is talking about her being a ""big city girl"". In fact, she is raised in a small part just outside of the city with very rural/smalltown character. 90% of her friends and peer groups are from that part of the city (lets call it her ""hood""). IMO the lifestyle in this ""hood"" has nothing to do with life in a big city (cosmopolitan, open-minded, diverse etc.), but is rather a typical german small-village-life, with many old traditions, conservative world views etc. - my GF seems to enjoy this little world - i accept it, it is her life and even it is nothing for me, i understand where she is coming from.

&#x200B;

One month ago my GF phoned with her Ex-BF, because they had to talk about some organizing stuff (they are in the same hobby union) and were together for 5 years, broke up 2 years ago or so. But are still in friendly contact - he also lives in the said small-town/hood of my girlfriend. I have no problems with it - i trust her and know that she is not interested in him. During the phone they also talked about plans for the summer and she said ""I am going on vacation to \[city\] with \[my name\]"" - she told me he reacted surprised when he heard that i had turkish heritage and told her ""Haha, i think we have to talk about that!"". And she just said ""Haha, ok"" and that was it. I was pissed about her reaction to him and told her that I think it is illoyal towards me. When some of my turkish friends (i barely have any) would call my girlfriend out like this and said ""Haha, we need to talk about your german infidel girlfriend"" in such a degrading way I would answer: ""Listen up you idiot, the heritage of my girlfriend is absolutely none of your business and does not make any difference"" or something similar.

&#x200B;

GF went on to tell me that he ""did not have any bad intentions"" and ""just was surprised"". I thought that for me it was a sign of latent racism and that i whished that she had stood up for me instead of blatantly tolerating it and shrugging it of - i would have done the same for her. I think she did not get it and still doesn't get it because she thinks ""no harm done, he didnt mean it."".

c43ctl	2019-06-23 11:49:34		AITA for telling my ex who's been living with me to move out?	"So here's the story, i'm going to try to keep this short. My ex and I have a 6 year old daughter, we haven't been living together and just remained friends since she was born (co-parenting). During the time we didn't live together I bought a house, etc, etc and she dated another guy.

&#x200B;

Well last year she broke up with that random guy and we tried to make things work. She moved in and as you can tell to keep this story semi-short, things went south pretty fast. So obviously, we called it off and at the time my work schedule was insane and I wasn't really ever home, so I told her she could stay in my spare bedroom for a while, only give me a little bit ($100 a month) to go toward bills, and save up cash to get back on her feet. That was 11 months ago and she's still here.

&#x200B;

So last night I asked her to please look for another place and i'd like her to be out in 2-3 months, and explained I just wanted to live by myself. She exploded saying I was selfish and every name under the sun, and that she had nowhere to go, etc, etc., and she barely saved up cash cause she blew it on hanging out with friends or random junk.

&#x200B;

I really don't think i'm the asshole here, but I could be wrong. I feel like having given her the opportunity to get up on her feet and save cash, but her not having done so isn't my issue. And her not having a place to go (even though her family said they'd take her, but she said no) isn't really on my plate of things to worry about due to the fact in July it'll be a full year she's had to get on her feet.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Told ex to leave my house and find somewhere to live in the next 2-3 months after helping her for about a year. Got yelled at stating i'm selfish and every name in the book."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c43bom	2019-06-23 11:46:58	Fiance-Temp	AITA for not wanting God to be mentioned at my wedding?	"This is a throwaway account.

&#x200B;

So my fiancé and I are very happily engaged, both very much looking forward to the wedding.  We had agreed on a humanist wedding, but then my fiancé's parents announced at a meal with my mother that they would appreciate it if we had a priest.

&#x200B;

I can respect their wishes, and I want them to be happy, so I have suggested that we try to find a priest who doesn't mention God in the service.  Some people might say that it's not a big deal to have God mentioned at the ceremony, but for me it is.  I want to start my married life in complete honesty, I don't want to stand in front of my future wife and everyone we know and care about, and be thinking, ""I don't believe what this priest is saying.""

&#x200B;

But my fiancé now is saying that I am being unreasonable, that God absolutely needs to be mentioned in the ceremony because she doesn't want to disappoint her parents.

&#x200B;

I'm putting my foot down on this.

&#x200B;

For some context, I'm not religious, my girlfriend is spiritual at best, and her parents are extremely involved in their local church.

c434kv	2019-06-23 11:31:05	jedimindblown	WIBTA for confronting my friend about her toxic kink life, or should I just let it be?	"I've (29F) been friends with Rebecca (30f) and her SO Jason(29m) for years. Around 2010 they started dating, and Rebecca confided in me that Jason pressured her to have sex with strangers. It made Reb feel terrible, but she felt like she had to do it in order to keep Jason.

Reb stops sleeping with strangers after a pregnancy scare, but in 2014, she has a daughter. Reb, Jason, and  daughter live with Reb's disabled mom and grandma in a trailer park.

In 2016, they married. She started working at a classy boutique and quickly became a ""key holder""/ manager there. They had active social lives where they took their daughter on playdates often. She was also working on earning her degree. 

Late Dec 2017, she and Jason joined the local Kink / BDSM community and claims it ""saved"" their marriage. I joined the community too. Reb became a favorite because she was willing to do anything and fell in with young (early 20s-30s) members. She got ""masters"" who had only been involved with Kink for a year or less, and began to go out almost every night, leaving the care of her daughter to her mom (Jason is not an awesome dad OR husband). The guy who ran the safety classes warned about entering into relationships with Dom's/masters who hadn't been in the lifestyle long because they tended to get toxic in their relationships. I faded away from the Kink scene, but Reb got deeper. 

she didn't hang out with vanilla friends anymore, and complained about how her mom was angry at being used as a babysitter, how Jason was jealous of her Doms, or how the manager at work had taken the keys away and cut her hours, plus tons of drama from the Kink crowd. Reb admitted that her daughter has no friends (because her Vanilla friends ""dropped"" her), and she won't put her in preschool or programs because of money. Reb's boyfriend and his wife moved in, and Jason was cheating with her bf's wife. One of Reb's former 19 yo Daddies was stalking her. She'd had 2 pregnant scares but hoped she was pregnant (3 bed modular where Gma, Mom, Reb, Jace, toddler, bf, and Bf's wife already live), and that she lost her job because her manager wasn't understanding. 

But, she'd become a staff member at the Kink Club, was out frequently and couldnt wait for the upcoming kink camping trip. All of which is NOT CHEAP to do.

Recently, Jason moved to a better job and wants Reb and their daughter with him, but she doesn't want to move. Reb said she it was because of her ""friends support."" As she doesn't hang out with any of our old mutual friends and almost exclusively hangs out with the young kink crowd, I assume that's what she means. 

In a year and a half, her living conditions have worsened, the relationship with her husband and mom has deteriorated, her little girl is wild and rarely gets to play with other kids, she's constantly involved with drama, she's lost her job, she's no longer on track for her degree, and now she's refusing to move because there's not enough kink.

c42tmn	2019-06-23 11:05:50	Radorarid	AITA for not liking my father's girlfriend?	"A quick backstory: I'm 19 years old now and my mother died of lung cancer in October 2017. My father got a new girlfriend after only three months. She's originally from Ukraine, but moved to Germany after the Soviet Union collapsed. Has two sons, one is an elder, the other is 16 years old now.

How hard I try, I can't seem to like her. I understand she's coming from a different cultural background and has, because of the political indoctrination, some other opinions. Thing is, she sees everything in black and white. Good and bad. Which led to some.....problems between here and me.

Some examples: I'm waking up on Saturday, I'm in a bad mood and I don't wanna talk to anybody. My family knows that and normally doesn't talk to me until it's 10 am. But not the girlfriend. She's talking constantly to me and I'm getting more annoyed by every second so I'm saying at one point: ""Just shut up please, I'm tired."" She stops and is quiet. One day later I receive a message from her, threating to end the relationship between her and my father because of me and accusing me to bring hate into their relationship. I'm like WTF?! 
I show the message to my father, he talks to her and everything ends up fine.

Another thing is, that she calls me ""sweetheart"".
I never allowed that to her, it's something my mother used to call me and I have decided that only my mother and girlfriend are allowed to.

Of course, there are also political differences, but that's normal for people.

These kind of examples keep on going and I'm getting more and more annoyed by her. It got to the point where I literally vomit on the inside on myself when she arrives at our home. And my mood is constantly bad, when I have to talk to her  or when she's present. For me, it's like she's invading my safespace. I don't even like here slavic accent, when she's talking, something she can't do anything about. (I have russian and polish friends, who also speak with accent and I don't have problems with them.)

My father said, I would appreciate her at some point and if not, I should at least accept her, so we can live ""in harmony."" (God, I hate this phrase)

c42tac	2019-06-23 11:05:01	ResponsibleScientist	AITA for insisting my friend be brought home?	"A while ago me and some friends organized a barbeque at another friend's house. While getting groceries, we also decided to stock up on some booze. We are all adults, we're all able to handle it we thought.

See, I went out with the same friends a couple times that ended in me being drunk, one time even puking all over the toilet at the friend's house where we held the BBQ, so I decided to not drink as much this time to keep sober.

Most of my friends drank up to their limit, stopping when they should, but others didn't. One friend in particular went too far, puking everywhere and being too drunk to stand up straight.

Now, here's the important bit, we were all using a bicycle to get there. However, some of us, including the friend in question, had to cycle for about 45 minutes to get home. Seeing as he was too drunk to be able to stand up straight, we arranged transportation for him to get home safely, but he refused to just be taken home.

He said he was confident enough to be able to get home, even while he couldn't stand up straight. Because he was so convinced he could drive home, he refused to just get in the car getting angrier by the minute.

After a lot of arguing the driver of the car gave him an ultimatum: get in, or just go on the bicycle anyway. He picked the latter.

The reason we wanted him to get home safe so badly is because he was in an accident that caused him to lose parts of his long term memory. We wanted to protect him from experiencing that again. Still, he refused and went on the bicycle anyway.

An important aside here, he mentioned that he had been in this situation before and knew that he would be fine if he just had some time to cycle to clear his had and get sober enough to continue all the way.

I started following him on my own bicycle and he immediately went the wrong way. I had to point him to the right direction. At the point where our ways would split, I stopped him for a conversation between the two of us to just talk it out. A lot was said, a lot of pointing fingers at each other for doing each other wrong.

Turns out he wanted to take responsibility for his actions and he didn't want us to take responsibility for him. He mentioned that he was always taken care of instead of taking care of himself on his own accord. He didn't want that anymore and instead take full responsibility for everything he would do from that point on.

Which I get, however, I pointed out that he had to consider what we wanted as well: to get him home safe. I also mentioned that he did the same previously when I was too drunk to cycle home. He even was the driver that took me home then.

After all that happened, I started thinking. Is that selfish to do? To effectively force someone against their will to be taken home even though they don't want to be taken home, and say they have been in a situation like this before which worked out fine? Am I the asshole for making him do that?"	No A-holes here	0	0	14.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

He said he would be fine with that and it’s like real life anime and would be cool. He said it would be like a cool hooters. 

I just find it weird how into anime he is as a 30 year old dude and he spends his entire day playing fantasy video games and watching anime and being on their forums and has naked anime girls as his phone background.

She wasn't talking to me, so I didn't listen. Her and her mum were having a conversation that began outside of the room, where I couldn't hear, therefore I assumed that it wasn't a conversation I needed to listen too.

"To give you guys some background information, I’ve (F22) been seeing this guy (M23) who we’ll call Ben for about a month now. We agreed to be exclusive about 2 weeks ago, (Not long, I know). We work smack in the middle of a large national park. It’s about an hour drive to get out of park boundaries and 3 hours to the closest Walmart. Therefore the company we work for provides us with dorms and an employee dining room inside the park. It’s a small and tight knit community so for the most part, everyone knows each other. Ben works one floor above me, but today I covered a shift upstairs. One of his co-workers informed me that Ben often brags about how he takes my credit card while I’m asleep, buys a shit ton of drinks at the employee pub, and sleeps with other women. As you can imagine, this upset me. I should point out that I’ve allowed Ben to use my credit card multiple times with the agreement that he’d pay me back. (I’m in a much better financial situation than him and wanted to help him out). He only owes me about 70$ but after hearing about his boasting, it became about far more than money. He gave me his room key earlier that day, so after I got off work I went into his room and took his iPad with the intention of holding onto it until he paid me back. Definitely not my proudest moment, but I felt that basic human decency wouldn’t be enough incentive for him to pay me back, so I wanted leverage. Being in the park, our only law enforcement is the rangers. They came knocking at my door at 4am demanding to know why I stole his iPad. I fessed up right away but now have a misdemeanor charge and a court date. I had assumed that Ben wouldn’t involve the rangers given he has a fat bag of magic mushrooms in his nightstand, but he did. I want to tell the rangers about this as payback, but the thought of actually doing it makes me feel more slimy than he is. Since the park is on federal land, he’d be charged with federal law. I don’t know much about federal law against mushrooms but I’m assuming he’d get in a lot of trouble and be fired. It seems like too harsh of a thing to do to someone, but a part of me feels like he has it coming. So tell me, WIBTA?

c42qo3	2019-06-23 10:59:09	FreedomDaisy	AITA or is my Catholic MIL?	"Update : To clarify, my posts are onto my facebook page. I have never sent anything in the family chat or even mentioned the LGBTQ+ community when she is around.

UPDATE : I have to spoken to J again regarding MIL asking for a ‘mother, son visit’. He has offered her the dinner plans I tried to make to see how she responds to that (In a chat I am not a part of). He is also going to speak to her and find our what’s going on and where she is at, and if it does result her refusing to include myself and our son he’ll be letting her know ‘She will have to get used to seeing a lot less of me then’ (His quote). Thankyou for the validation, love and advice. We both appreciate it so much.

This could be lengthy, bear with me.
I (24F) am engaged to a (26M) man (J) who was raised in Catholic faith but no longer practices. I am also bisexual and a huge advocate for the LGBTQ+ community. This has been a flag for J’s mum our whole relationship. (I had a ‘love is love’ banner on my facebook profile picture when we met and she asked about it the first she heard of me). 
Months ago after sharing yet another post in support of my community she proceeded to send hateful and hurtful articles into our family chat. I asked her to please not do this as it hurts me, that I respect her opinion and feel it will be best if we don’t discuss it with each other. J’s father later comment hate speech on this post and I removed myself from the family chat while J spoke to both parents and let them clearly know this was absolutely unacceptable. MIL apologised profusely and asked me to please come back to the chat. Once I calmed down I did so and we continued on as normal with some anxiety on my side.
About a month ago I again, posted another photo supporting my community to which MIL decided to comment hate speech on again. (Along the lines that gay people already had enough in Australia being able to have civil union ceremony’s and they don’t need to take over marriage). In anger I replied straight to her comment. Respectfully, but with anger and frustration in the tone. She deleted her comment, so I messaged her and again asked her not to do this. We have been here before and it’s not fair for J or any of the family. I told her I understand her views, admitted to being bisexual myself to explain why my stance will not be changed and pleaded with her to just not talk about this specific thing with me. She replied that she isn’t a ‘Sunday catholic’, posted some things to her page about ‘Satan being after her soul, God being more important than relationships etc’ and we really haven’t spoken since.
J hasn’t been in touch very much since it happened and they haven’t talked about it at all. Last he seen her she asked to do dinner plans (We used to do dinners monthly all together). On that note I reached out and tried to arrange a time everyone would be free so we could catch up, dinner, brunch, whatever. She was completely unresponsive and cold so I left it with her and said nothing further. J tells me today she has been asking to see ‘her sons’ clearly excluding myself from the plans. To make this worse, I also have a 5 year old from a previous relationship who she has previously accepted and loved deeply, but now he is no longer invited to their plans either. 
Am I the asshole for not tolerating the shit, or should I have let it go for the relationship sake? I feel guilty my son has been put into this divide too and like I am to blame for that.

I started my first job with REAL earning just a couple of weeks back (to distinguish from part-time jobs with salary just enough for me eating and spending on regular stuffs). 

Now that I have my first quarter of salary (I get paid by quarters, not month; that's why there's an asterisk), I want to spend it on something I've been wanting for a long time: a new laptop. As soon as I got paid, that's the first thing I thought of. I've been using this beat up Acer laptop since first year, and now it is extremely slow; the battery requires constant plugging in order to run properly, etc. So I wanted to wait until September (when I get my next quarter of salary) to spend the entirety of this quarter salary plus some of my savings to buy a laptop that I really want. 

It is currently summer, and I'm working 3 jobs simulteneously to save up for the laptop. Though tired as shit (I work everyday of the week from 7AM to 6PM), I've been giddy with excitement whenever I think of September and how I will be able to purchase my first laptop on my own. 

However, my mother talked to me about my jobs and earnings. Usually I don't talk to her about stuff like this that much, but since it's a new job and all, she wanted to know. I knew exactly what would come after when she asked how much did I got paid from that place. And surprise surprise, she asked me to give her more than 50% of my quarter salary. 

Note that I am still living with my family. They still pay for my meals and my bills, just not my allowance. This is why I don't know if I'm the asshole or not. I've been using this new laptop as the drive to get me through weeks of non-stop working, but now with a big chunk of money goodbye, it seem so far away.

I briefly explained to her that I wanted to buy a new laptop with that money. However, she said there's nothing wrong with my laptop. Please note, however, that my mother is completely tech-blind. 

TLDR; University student save up for new long-awaited laptop, mom said ""Give me 50% of that money"".

c42q5w	2019-06-23 10:57:53		AITA for avoiding the woman I like?	"So the woman I like is also a very close friend of mine. We met at work we gravitated towards each other instantly. We could hot desk at work (sit wherever we wanted rather than having a seating plan) but I didn't sit downstairs for the first few months as I wasn't comfortable taking my work with me until I felt as though I 100% understood my role.

Occasionally I would hotdesk out of the accounts office and into the main upstairs office and hang out with people there, and sometimes she would be there and we would share a bank. Eventually, I started hotdesking everywhere and we are of fell into a routine of sitting together wherever we were. I wanted to sit somewhere and I was at work first, she'd find me and vice verse. We'd hang out occasionally outside of work, share food and drinks, I'd give her my jacket if she was cold on a night out and whatnot. It got to the point where if I went upstairs for the day without letting her know she would message me asking where I am.

One day, despite the fact she's in a turbulent relationship, we were talking about ex's and when I mentioned something about the ex I had a thing with for 4 years, my friend said: ""so that's why you like me."" That's the moment she knew I liked her. Well, I think so.

I didn't think anything of it, I never expected anything from it, I think she just wanted to confirm whatever she had been thinking. A week or so passes from that moment and she's still talking to one of the girls about what she wants in a guy, how she's ready to get married and so on, and so I took a chance and asked her about me. She said I'm not her type.

A few more weeks pass and the rejection starts hitting me. It's driving me crazy because I know I can make her happy, I wanted to make her happy, I already make her happy on a daily basis. I decided after the weekend I will start sitting elsewhere, I won't talk to her, I won't message her, I won't hang out with her, I'll just get over her and be her friend when I'm in a much better place. It sucks liking someone who doesn't like you back, and when everything else in life feels like rubbish it really takes you to your breaking point.

So this weeks comes around and I work upstairs for a few days. Move back downstairs on Wednesday but sit on the opposite side of the room. She messages me asking what's wrong, why I'm not with her and so on I just keep it all to a minimum. I told her I'm just stressed from work and need time alone. Which is true, but not my reason for avoiding her. She states I'm lying and asks me to tell her the truth. I started I'll message her later on then.

I message her telling her the truth of why I'm avoiding her; it hurts, I like someone who doesn't like me back, and I don't want that messing up our friendship so I just want some time to myself.

She didn't reply, she sent me a 'reaction' on FB messager. I now realise I've probably ruined our friendship anyway.

Anyways my friend is away at summer camp w/ my crush. They’re both in the same class as me. My friend never really liked my crush because she found him quite annoying, but I always told her that he’s super nice and calm when you have a conversation with him.

So my friend was texting me and she said that they’ve been talking a bit and she’s finding him really nice now. I’m glad because I was getting tired of her constantly saying bad things about how annoying she found him. At their summer camp they get to go to dances and she told me they danced together (it’s not anything romantic by the way they just get paired together randomly) and I felt so jealous. 

TO CLARIFY I WOULD NEVER TELL HER TO STOP TALKING TO HIM OR STOP INTERACTING WITH HIM BECAUSE THAT’S A PURE ASSHOLE MOVE AND I KNOW THAT!! Like I said I like them getting to know each other better because it’s healthier for her to not always rant about him being annoying and stuff

c42pwr	2019-06-23 10:57:18	leader556	AITA if I refuse to deliver my ex back her items?	"We broke up about a year and a half ago. When she abandoned me in another city, stuck me with the remainder of a lease, and dug me in to debt to support her not working for nine months. I moved back from the city, and I now live about thirty minutes from her. When she fled, she left some stuff (high end jewelry, clothes, signed memorabilia from a famous singer, etc.) I asked her to come get her things multiple times, but she never would. Eventually she blocked me on everything. 

I finally said fuck it and started asking around to see if people had any interest in buying these things. She found out, and is now demanding I drive to her house and drop everything off. I told her to fuck off. I told her she can come get her things personally, and she has a week to do it. Now she's blasting me all over social media, calling me a thief and a liar, and from what I've seen from screenshots of mutual friends, is basically calling for people to come to my house and take it by force. So now I'm in full rooftop Korean mode and am sitting on my roof with a rifle.

I don't even want the fucking things. I didn't want it a year and a half ago when she pulled a vanishing act, and I don't want it now. I'm tempted to just block her and sell it all. Maybe buy myself a new motorcycle.

Edit: I'm in rooftop Korean mode because lately a bunch of coyotes and foxes have been trying to eat my chickens (rural ranch life is fun) and I have to protect my flock, not because I'm waiting for someone to walk onto my property. But in all honesty, her brothers have broken in to an exes house before and kicked seven shades of shit out of him after he slapped her during an argument.

c42peu	2019-06-23 10:56:08		AITA for being upset at my boyfriend for planning a trip with his friends?	"My bf is a busy man and I don’t get to spend much time with him. He gets up at 5:40 am to work out with his friends, works from 9-5pm, goes to class from 5:45pm to around 8 pm, grabs a quick bite to eat and tries to sleep by 9:30, sometimes 10:30pm. This is his schedule M-F, he’s with family Saturday, spends half of Sunday on chores so out of 7 days, I see him half a Sunday. His schedule is tight. I go to university full time from September to June, though I’m on summer break right now.

He has a couple weeks in the beginning of August with no class, after summer school ends and before fall begins. During this time he’s planned to go to Europe with his friends - tickets already booked. This is very exciting for him as it’s his first time out of the country, and money all earned by himself! He’s excited to travel and I’m excited for him.
 
I just can’t help but be upset that I barely have time with him and after his trip, he has to go back to school and his schedule. He told me about this *after* he planned the trip, and he and I have never even had the time to go on a road trip. However if he knows I’m upset while he’s on the trip, he’s going to feel horrible the whole time and it’ll be a complete waste, which I’ll also feel bad about.

c42mma	2019-06-23 10:49:25	Shadynurse	AITA for getting a dog after my boyfriend told me not to?	"We’re both in our 20’s, have been dating almost 4 years and bought a house together in December. We’ve lived together a couple years before that. We both have steady well paying jobs and I’m currently in school. Our house is your average sized house, 3 bedrooms 2 bathroom, nice big yard. My dream dog is a French bulldog, and a little under two years ago we agreed to get a puppy.

We got Winston, ended up paying $1400 for him (great deal for a frenchie!) and even went back and bought his brother who was the last one left (Bentley). We were both totally in love. We got them when we still lived in an apartment together. 

NOW as the boys started to grow up, they definitely aren’t French bulldogs. They’re absolutely Boston terriers and that lady totally screwed us and we definitely didn’t research enough. I don’t love them any less and they are the light of my life, I’m keeping them forever. However, my desire for a frenchie has not gone away, it’s my dream dog! 

I was browsing Craigslist and came across a woman looking to rehome her frenchie girl who was 4 years old. My heart dropped and i texted my boyfriend asking can we please please please get her and I get a cold “no”. I do tend to be very impulsive and disregarded the opinions of others, but I really wanted him to be on the same page. I told him we have our own house, she’s 4, house trained crate trained leash trained good with kids and dogs, and only a $250 rehoming fee! Still, I got a no. I called my mom and asked her, she said get her (she knows how bad I wanted a frenchie) and if it didn’t work out she’d take her. So I drove an hour away to pick her up after work and she’s the sweetest chillest dog I’ve ever had in my life. I called my boyfriend to the car when I got home to “get a bag” and surprise him but the look on his face when he saw her just was pure confusion and anger. He ended up screaming at me and left. 

Flash forward to the next day, he gives me the ultimatum of “its me or the dog”. He says he feels betrayed that I went behind his back after he said no and he doesn’t want 3 dogs, it’s too much work, and that if I don’t get rid of her, we’re splitting and selling the house. He doesn’t want to be with someone who would make such a huge decision without him and disregard his opinion of having 3 dogs because it’s his house too (only my name is on the mortgage but he pays half of the bills) 

Now I love my boyfriend, but I feel like this is ridiculous. I honestly thought he’d react differently and be on board once he saw her! Other than this, we have a great relationship and rarely argue or fight. We’ve talked about marriage and kids soon.

c42m0f	2019-06-23 10:48:02	JayHarmon	AITA for sending my dad a text message on father's day?	"I'm a 33 year old married woman who moved out of my home state last year. Up to last year, we always lived within a few hours drive of my parents. Now, we're 1k miles away so one of the changes has been that we can no longer easily visit for Father's day and similar holidays. 

It's also worth mentioning that my parents regularly miss events like wishing my husband a happy birthday. It's the same day as my brother's and my parents adore my husband. They can just be forgetful. It was a family tradition to give money to the younger  generation of married people on their anniversary. My grandma used to do that for us before her dementia set it. My parents did it as well until a few years ago. I wasn't at all bothered that it stopped, I was always appreciative but I never really got why it was a thing. The point being that my parents have set a precedence for gift giving holidays being relaxed or skipped. I'm not big on any of these so I've been alright with it. 

When we moved, my mom and I had talked and basically decided we would just send presents through the mail or just send presents from Amazon directly to the recipient. It's just easier that way. For Father's day, I got my dad a nice belt he'd wanted and made sure it got there early so he could open it on the day. They received it just fine. 

On the day of, I sent him a text message wishing him a happy Father's day and a hope that he likes the belt. That night, when telling my husband everything, he was shocked I hadn't at least called. He believes a text message and a gift aren't enough and was surprised I went through so little trouble. And, to be honest, looking back it feels like minimal effort. So, AITA?"

For the past 2 years, my mother and I have been living overseas and came back earlier last week to visit family. It was a 13 hour flight so I have been jetlagged for the last few days. Back when my mother and I lived in the same country as my grandparents, we visited during holidays. I was younger so I didn’t have much of my own tastes or anything and just ate what my hosts gave me. However, now, when I look around their house... It’s gross. My grandparents allow their cat to roam the kitchen, on the countertops and even the top of the stove. Just earlier I saw the cat rub itself against dishes that were drying. In the silverware drawer, there is pet hair. The cat regularly sits on top of the dining table while people eat. I brought this up to my mother, so she picked me up some frozen meals to eat instead of what my grandparents cooked. 

Another detail, because of my jet lag I have been sleeping through normal dinner times and waking up around midnight so it’s not like I actively try to avoid eating with them, it is just a natural reaction. The day we landed, my grandfather took me out to eat. The second day, they ordered pizza  And the third they ordered in food, all of these 3 meals I did eat.

c42f87	2019-06-23 10:32:00		AITA for purposefully making people feel old at work?	"My dad/brother own a very successful business and wanted a SM account. A lot of companies try really hard to sound ""trendy"" on SM. They hop on trends and slang months after they die out, or they try to hard and kill a trend themselves. Then there are the painful attempts at ""talking black"". So, my brother figured that the best person to run their accounts is a 19 year old black girl. Since then, I took a summer job at an office running their accounts for minimum wage. Everyone else has a whole career in the office doing stuff they went to school for. They all do **very** high-paying jobs

Before me, the ""young"" people there were in their early 30s.

I never pay attention to what goes down in that office, I always have on headphones, but this is something that I couldn't help but notice. A lot of the younger people there seem to have a HUGE ego about being ""so young and so successful""

There's these guys who are always ""flexing"" their age in front of the older employees. It's really hard to explain, but they always calls attention to how much younger they are than the other employees. They complain about old people and even make old jokes toward coworkers. It clearly makes the older workers uncomfortable. The gag is, they're all ""older"" to me. But the ""older"" people are my favs. They're all very sweet and humble

In the break room, the older people were all talking about their fav songs growing up. The younger guys were laughing and talking about hearing those songs on classic radio stations. The older people were clearly annoyed.

I took off my headphones and said ""Wow, you guys still listen to the radio"" and they said they do sometimes.

I was moving super shocked and said ""You guys are the first people I've met , who listen to the radio. What do you do when they play a song you hate? Sit there with a frown until the song changes?""

I really don't know anyone who still listens to the radio, that's true. But I've listened to it before, and clearly know how it works, I was playing dumb. They laughed it off. When the king of flexing his age said his fav song had so many memories attached to it, I said it gave me memories too. I called it a classic and said we danced to it at our flashback themed dance at camp last year. **That was 100% true.** The guy looked like he was having a heart-attack. They said I was making them feel old and to go back to twitter. I said I can show them how to make an account. I went back to minding my own business.

Later, I took off my headphones for a sec. An older woman said it was 2005. She was 27, and graduated law school. That was the song she listened to that day.

This one guy was laughing about ""crazy"" it was that he finished HS that year. I said that was my year of kindergarten, got more heart-attacks. The older woman had a huge smile on her face.

I don't want to go because I hate my school, I don't like many of the people I went to school with (of course I have some friends but like 10 out of a class of a couple hundred), and I have very bad anxiety (feels like a bad case of heartburn) about being around large amounts of people like in party halls, churches, and auditoriums.  I know these things aren't completely avoidable but I try my best especially when I'm meant to be the center of attention like in this situation. 

My mom really wants me to go because she wants to see me walk. That's it.

We aren't walking away with anything, no diploma, no certifications, not even a report card and I don't want to put myself through pain for nothing.  In addition they expect us to come 3 different days after graduation to collect our report card and diploma. I've made it known to my mom I do not want to go but she still wants me to go.

We previously had a dog who passed away at almost 18 years old so he was too old to bark. Recently, we adopted two five year old Shepherd mixes, one of which is quiet, but the other is jumpy and barks at noises/dogs.

Our neighbor's are retired on both sides and are outside all of the time. On one side, the guy is nice and plays with our dogs (who just bark at him nonstop) so we're hoping they get used to him. On the other side, the guy will tell at his dog when our dogs bark and gives us death glares of we let our dogs out. This generally doesn't bother me because our dogs NEED to go outside so I'll let them out for five minutes to do their business and let them back in.

The problem is that the dogs need more time outside. We walk them and take them to parks but it's not enough. They have so much energy at night it's keeping us up with all of the barking. We found that keeping them outside for an hour helps them let off energy and sleep. But, because our neighbor's are constantly outside, our dogs bark at them the entire hour.

I'm worried that they're barking too much and it's annoying the other neighbors, but they're outside ALL of the time so I can't time them to come out without them being outside. AITA for letting them bark for an hour to let out steam?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

&#x200B;

I started seeing a guy a couple months ago, he's a friend of a friends boyfriend. Things seemed okay after the first few times I saw him, but then it seemed to turn more into a FWB situation that any form of actual dating relationship, from my side at least. Pretty sure it was the same on his side too - I know he was still on tinder, and he tried sliding into one of my best friends DMs while I was away for a weekend (how stupid can you be, srsly??). I'm not overly annoyed at him for doing that, though I probably should be. As far as I'm concerned, it was a casual thing and we had no loyalty to one another. He went away for a while so we didn't speak while he was gone, and he didn't really message me much when he got back and I didn't message him either, I was more than happy to let is fizzle out as I could feel my mental health slipping a little bit due to other circumstances and wanted to focus on me for a little while.

&#x200B;

When he went away, I joined tinder and went on a couple of dates, the last one of which wasn't terrible and we said we would like to see each other again. I'm not 100% on this guy, after all it's only been one date and while we had some really good chats, I'm not sure if there was enough attraction there for me, but it went well enough that I let him give me a little kiss when I left and agreed to a second date.

&#x200B;

The only reason why I'm now having issues, is guy number one that I was seeing popped back up again during the week.  I mentioned a little bit of what had been going on with me and that I hadn't been doing so great, and he was super lovely and supportive about it, and mentioned that I could always come to him and he would listen. He messaged me this morning saying he wanted to take me to dinner to after the shitty time I've been having. It's worth noting that I feel something more would probably follow dinner...

c425k9	2019-06-23 10:08:48	A_Sarcastic_Werecat	WIBTA if I didn't give chewing gum to a screaming toddler on a plane, who needs the gum for his/her ear pain?	"Hypothetical situation, cos my friend and I were arguing about **whether we are obligated to share, and if so, when and where.** It got heated and at the end, we designed three situations to suss out when to share and when not to. ( A fourth one about ""involuntary sharing"").I can post my opinion at the end, but I first wanted some feedback unbiased from our discussion.

&#x200B;

1. I  am on the airplane and I bought myself three packs of chewing gum. Assume that I will need them all (experience), cos I have ear pain on every flight. There is a toddler who needs the chewing gum to tone down his or her ear pain. WIBTA if I didn't give the chewing gun to the toddler who also has ear pain?Would it change your opinion if I could legitimately go deaf from the ear pain? Or  if it's not a toddler but an adult with ear pain? Do I have to give away the chewing gum?(I know I shouldn't fly if I have ear pain and could go deaf).
2. Let's assume  that it is a long distance flight (over 16 hours) and the toddler screams for at least 2 hours due to the ear pain. Everyone knows that I have chewing gum which could ""calm down"" the toddler. Do I have to ""sacrifice"" my chewing gum for the sake of the quiet of the plane? Does it matter how long he/she screams?Would it change opinions if (a) it was a short flight, if (b) I needed all the chewing gum for my own ear pain, if (c) the chewing gum was a very expensive gift for someone else and I don't actually need it? Would it change opinions if the toddler doesn't have ear pain and just wants my chewing gum?
3. If my friend gifted me the chewing gum - and he is on the plane and wants me to give the chewing gum to the toddler. Is he in the right to ask me to use his gift (which is now mine) on the toddler?
4. Let's assume that I leave for the toilet and someone goes through my bag to get the chewing gum to give it to the toddler. Blessed Quiet! Let's assume that the chewing gum is peanut-based (allergen). Do I have to immediately inform the flight crew and the parents that the toddler ate an allergen? (chewing gum was in my bag, not out in the open).(I would immediately inform the parents, but still my friend and I had a heated discussion about the fact that someone actually had to go through my bag to get to the chewing gum). WIBTA if I alerted the crew and asked them to have the person arrested for theft when we are landing? (Would it matter if the toddler had been screaming for over 10 hours now in this hypothetical scenario?)Would it change anyone's opinion if it were an adult that stole my chewing gum cos he/she had tremendous ear pain?

***\*many thanks to the people that pointed out that chewing gum is a laxative and not suitable for kids, I didn't know that as I am not a chewing gum person!  I just used it as an example for anything that calms the toddler down.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**EDIT:  Many thanks to anyone who participated! My friend and I had this discussion, because we were wondering whether we are ""obligated"" to give money to beggars/animal rescues etc. Then we were wondering whether it makes a difference if more people than one are affected. Hence the ""plane scenario"".**

&#x200B;

***Scenario (1):***

***My position: If I am in a plane and I have something that could calm the kid down, I should suck it up and give up part of my chewing gum/bottle/whatever. But then my friend pointed out that I should also do that for an adult person even if he is not crying because of ear pain. He also pointed out that then two people are in pain except of one, so the ""net summary"" is two adults/one adult and the toddler instead of just the adult/toddler. I thought I should share in any case, my friend thought that one should share only in case of the screaming toddler if at all, because you would gain blessed silence.***  
***So, we couldn't get to an agreement. I thought that it was a nice gesture and if I could, I should help.***

***His position: thought that my hypothetical something should only be shared if I don't lose anything (e.g. I can take care of my own ear pain first) and if it has an overall net positive (quiet in the plane, grateful adult). So, if I keep having ear pain, I should keep my own chewing gum.***

&#x200B;

***Everything under (2) did not change his opinion at all, but I would still try to give the toddler the hypothetical chewing gum\*\* in every scenario save the one where he has no earpain (I don't negotiate with ""terrorists"", hit me with stones).***

&#x200B;

***Scenario (3) with the gift was to test whether ownership makes any difference.***

***Scenario (4) actually happened to my friend. One parent actually went to his bag (outer pocket) to get his water bottle out as the parent's kid was thirsty. And onlookers told him that it was a ""hot day"" and ""he should suck it up"".  That's why he asked me to include it.***

My husband is returning to Texas with the kids, and I have to stay on this week for a work conference. My husband wants me to drive with him to the airport from Maine, help him return the rental car, and get the kids in to the airport, then get a train to my conference, which I need to be at by 1:00 pm, in a city an hour outside of Boston. He feels overwhelmed at the prospect of getting the kids to and into the airport by himself. I have explained to him that he can do curbside checking for the bags, so he doesn’t have to worry about lugging all the bags around with him. I explained to him also that I can’t even go through security with him and the kids, so it’s not as if I can help him with the bulk of the journey.  I don’t think I need to go hours out of my way, with my own luggage. then have to get a train, then get from the train station to my conference, when my mom can just drive me straight to my conference and my husband can take the kids on his own.

c41zow	2019-06-23 09:55:11		AITA for talking trash about my friend’s girlfriend in front of her?	"Well, that girlfriend was extremely manipulative and a toxic person. They’ve been together for a year but I can see how they’ve had an emotionally abusive relationship. 

That gf (we’ll just call her Jenny) was cheating over and over again, but she gets jealous over petty interactions of my friend (we’ll call my friend Kate) to another people. Jenny talks shit to Kate on social media when problem arises, throwing some shades and things like that, but when Jenny was confronted about it, she will defend herself saying “not all the things i post on my account is about your friend,” which is clearly not true. 

Next, when Kate initiates a break up or a cool off, that gf will threaten her, saying she will “go back to smoking and drinking” and ugly shits like that. Jenny will also rebut with “I can’t live without you, please. I can’t live if you’re not with me.” (pretty generic and cringy but yes, it’s really true she did say that a lot of times). Of course, Kate will get confused because she’s a softie and she would always go back to Jenny. Literally, she makes Kate feel crazy and confused. One day, she wants to break up and one day, she wants to go back to her.

Recently, Jenny accused Kate of cheating (idk where she got that lmao, it’s just like that suddenly) and Kate was so damn tired of everything, my friend decided to break up with her. At that time, I was so relieved that she finally got the courage to break up with her. 

And then one day, Jenny and Kate are together again and I was so upset with that decision. She told me that Jenny would always go in front of Kate’s house and beg her to come back to her. I said, just let her be, she will go away no matter what. But the way I see it, she still loves Jenny so much. Jenny didn’t want to let my friend go, and she felt like she had no other choice to make Jenny stop but to do what Jenny wants.

After that events, I recently made some rude comments to Jenny, saying, “I thought you guys are already done with each other? Oh, I forgot. Jenny didn’t want Kate off the hook because she’s just borderline crazy and manipulative,” in a mocking manner. I also brought up the topic of exes and I told them Kate’s ex was very pretty (I think Jenny got jealous lmao don’t care about her). Later, Jenny told me I was insensitive but i couldn’t care less. I was very surprised Kate then blocked my number for a few hours and I messaged her with another number of mine asking what’s wrong. She told me, she was offended with my statement. And now she’s still angry at me. 

I understand though that what I said was insensitive. But Kate wouldn’t talk to me about that issue. I already apologized but she keeps on leaving me on read. Kate loves her girlfriend so much that she doesn’t like it  when someone talks shit about Jenny.

I think I really crossed a line I shouldn’t cross but at the same time, Jenny kinda deserved it?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c41y2n	2019-06-23 09:51:19	showeruncle	AITA for showering my niece?	"Obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. Also a heads up I personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what I actually did wrong. 

So last weekend I  [25M] was watching my niece [3F]. I have a daughter [5F] myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. On this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. Okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. What was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. Seriously I went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when I came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. I immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. I helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while I washed hers. 

I thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly I didn't even think twice about doing it. My SIL does not agree. She keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that I should've called her to okay it first. That mindset is kinda confusing to me. Like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who I always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, what was I supposed to do? Let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? However, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when I'm a man and not her dad. Are they right and I'm missing the point or am I right that there's nothing weird about it?

ETA: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so I'll address them. 

1. My daughter's mother is dead and I'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. Idk if my SIL was abused. Will throw out there though that I was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and I as kids.

3. I was *NOT* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think I was. I never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. Yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

c41w31	2019-06-23 09:46:29	harborspirit	"AITA for asking the ""expert guitarist"" in our band to try playing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?"	"A cocky metalhead guitar player in our band acts like he is gods gift to music - he plays harsh, loud, and oftentimes incorrectly out of key. As an exercise, I asked him to use his ear to figure out twinkle twinkle little star, and he got offended. I asked why he wouldn't attempt it, and he says he's already an expert and it's beneath his skill level. 

So if that's true, why wont he at least prove it? Is he too badass and epic to play a ""little baby nursery rhyme"" (his words, not mine.)? Fast forward a week later, and were all having another rehearsal. Everything is going great - until it's time for break. That's when he brings up the incident of me asking him to do that simple nursery rhyme exercise, and he got angry about it, like he was trying to start something. we start arguing, and the fangs come out. It became 3 v 1 when the rest of the band took his side. I believe it was only to protect his ego.

They said I was being an asshole because I was asking him to do something he didnt want to do - which in my view was an exercise to improve his ear instead of just fast sweep picking craziness. But they took it as an attack on him, to which they used on me, by asking me to play the melody to Iron Man. Well I played it by taking my time to figure it out, which was the whole point of the exercise in the first place.

Finally, he says he'll do it. After all the anger and animosity and arguing, he picks up the guitar, and what we all hear is twinkle twinkle little star, except 75% of it is wrong. Two more attempts and it's still barely recognizable. I look around at everyone who turned on me to protect this ""expert"" guitarists feelings, and said fuck this, I'm going home. I quit the band on the spot.

c41tc4	2019-06-23 09:39:44	honuwonu	WIBTA if I tell my mom she isn’t respecting my sister’s boundaries and privacy?	"I am home from university for the summer. I’ve been home for about a month and living on an air mattress in my older sister’s room.

My sister stills lives with my mom but it is more of a roommate arrangement. My sister pays a little less than half of rent and all of the utilities. My mom pays 200 more in rent but and no other household bill.

When I first got back, I noticed that my sister had a sign on her door saying “please knock” and “if you didn’t pay for it, don’t take it.”

The only one who does not respect the notes is our mom. She tends to just barge in and take whatever she wants. She mostly takes stationary supplies because she refuses to buy her own and she’ll eat whatever snacks my sister has stored.

A few days ago, she barges into the room while my sister was getting ready for work and I was reading a book. I told her “there is a thing called” and then I knocked on the wall so that she will get the hint.

My mom then goes on a rant about how she is the head of household and she doesn’t have to knock.

Yesterday, I went out with my sister. When we got back home, my mom told my sister “I ate your chocolate.” It wasn’t my sister’s chocolate. It was my chocolate that my sister had bought for me as payment for making her spam musubi. I had stored it on my sister’s desk which is probably why my mom thought it was hers. 

Later during the night, my mom barges in the room, waking us both up, to return my sister’s lotion bottle that neither of us had noticed was gone.

I know my mom’s action deeply annoy and frustrates my sister, as she had told me. But my sister would never speak up against my mom. It will cause too much drama and my mom will more than likely start explosively yelling if confronted like she tends to do. Instead of confronting our mom, my sister tends to just overwork herself so she doesn’t have to be home with her.

My question is: would I be the asshole if the next time my mom barges into my sister’s room or take from my sister without permission, I were to say something. I plan on saying something along the lines of: “My sister pays her rent for this room. Even if you are head of household that doesn’t give you the right to not respect her boundaries or rules she set for the room. You have to knock and ask to use her things like the rest of us.”

My sister says it’s not worth it. But I know she is only telling me that because she doesn’t want me to be on the receiving end of my mom’s anger."	Not the A-hole	0	0	23.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

c41mlp	2019-06-23 09:23:24	randomATIAthrowaway	AITA for breaking up with no contact for 2+ months?	"So uh, throwaway of course.

&#x200B;

I've been dating my GF for a long while until recently. We really kicked it off, and we used to spend at least a day a week with eachother. At least until recently. They told me they wanted to get their house in order, and I thought the best course of action was to step back and let her do that at her request. I'm not here to be a burden, but to support my partner. I accepted that I wouldn't see her so often, and that since she was stressed out and dealing with her own thing, that'd I'd have less contact with her. 

&#x200B;

We'd been keeping up regularly when all of that stopped. I had accepted that might happen, but I didn't think it'd be at the scale at which it was at. I'm a pretty paitent person, so I waited a month and basically asked WTF was going on. I know it sucks feeling like that and being in that headspace. We're supposed to be partners but that seemed to just go out the window. All I wanted was a simple ""Hey, everything is awful, but I'm still here!"". I texted her and basically got told that I knew that this was going on, and to suck it up. She wouldn't elaborate on what was going on at all, saying that I should understand that this was going on and I signed up for it. 

&#x200B;

I'm pretty cool with understanding health problems. I grew up with them, experienced them, and even was nearly killed by one of them. But at least I communicated out the basic issues. But I couldn't get a straight answer to what was going on or how to help her, even if by just being available for whatever. I get all of that. I asked what I could do and she said that she'd deal with her thing on her own. TBH, it felt like I was getting ghosted late in the relationship. After all of that I just said I couldn't exist in a relationship where my partner couldn't tell me anything at all. I'm still super bummed out and second guessing myself. I've been cheated on a couple of times before and found out by snapchat in 6+ to 2 year relationships. I'm not willing to spend months in limbo only to find out i'm getting replaced or just not even thought about. 

&#x200B;

I've been burned so many times i'm just second guessing myself these days. I can't wait with someone telling me its a health issue and then not communicating about it. I'm 100% not concerned about needing time or personal space for health, and I don't care about health being an issue, I've already grown up with that, dealt with it, and willing to deal with it. I value the companionship and emotional connection we have. I'm 100% concerned that after a 6+ month relationship that said issue can't be talked about, nor trusted with me to know about. I still think she's the most amazing and strong person I've met, but that flaw is killer. I'll never be able to truly be her equal without the threat of a divorce by manipulation. What happens if we made up and it happens again in an even longer term relationship?

I had a friend on Discord, who is autistic. Initially, we got along quite well. Then a few months later, it became evident they were becoming a burden to me, even if they didn't mean it that way.

They considered me their best friend, but eventually I realised it was making me really depressed to continue talking to them, since they complained about almost everything and behaved too annoyingly sometimes. Still, I held off from cutting relations since they don't have any other friends and are autistic, as mentioned before.

One day, it just became too much to bear and I unfriended and blocked them. They are in another server I'm in, and they just complain about everything there as well. I'm sure they don't mean to annoy or hurt anyone, but I've been hurt too badly myself, because of them.

  
Edit: I did not befriend them because they were autistic. At the time, I was into GNU/Linux, and a mutual introduced us to each other. I only found out about their autism around two months after we'd been friends.   


TL;DR: I blocked and unfriended an autistic friend on Discord.

Thank you all in advance.

It started simple, flirting, eating lunch together. She's from a completely different culture and Muslim. Tonight we were sitting in her car (front seats) after work and it was late. Literally just talking and holding hands. Her ex husband tried to call her several times and she didn't answer and I guess this pissed him off because out of nowhere he drives up along side her car. He must have looked up her GPS location somehow (snapchat or Facebook or something.)  

So she gets out of the car. They fight, shouting at eachother in Somali. She gets back in the car and apologizes. I say it's probably best if I leave tonight. She agrees. As I'm walking away her ex husband pulls  up in his car right at me like he's going to run me over and gets out. Says he's her husband (left out the divorced part) and yells at me not to talk to her or see her again.

I like this woman a lot. I can already tell that seeing her is going to invite drama into both our lives and that this guy is probably feeling pretty hurt.

Am I the asshole if I continue to see her?  There is definitely a huge clash of cultures going on here. Muslim women aren't usually permitted to mary outside their religion and American style 'dating' is not really done in Somali culture. Her original marriage was arranged by her parents so it's not like she even got to choose this guy.

I don't know what else to say. I definitely feel like the asshole right now though. I can tell this guy was really upset."	Not the A-hole	0	0	77.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

So today I went out with my gf and when we came back at 11 my parents weren't home. I called my Dad and he said they went to the city and will be home late. Time goes by and I can to make sure they are okay to no avail. I figure then being adults they are fine (btw the ages of everyone is me-22 gf-25 mom-62 dad-67). 

I get a call while in bed, it's my mom asking me the address to a hospital saying my dad is being weird. She said it like this ""can you give me the fucking address to (hospital). Your father is acting wierd"" I ask ""the hospital address"" because I was still kind of out of it. She replied ""yeah the fucking address oh my God"" (she is also slurring like crazy). So I give her the address and in my head I'm freaking out and preparing for the worst. 

After an hour and trying to call siblings realizing it's really late I decide to wait. Then I hear them both come home and think maybe he had too much to drink and is okay. Might just need to sleep it off and I'll ask if he's okay tomorrow because again it's late. I'm in my room with my gf and I hear a banging on my door. I go out to see what it is and my mom starts screaming that I don't give a shit about my dad. I ask what happened and she doesn't answer.

I yell telling her to tell me and she says I'm a piece of shit. In anger I pushed down the karaoke machine (childish I know but I realize I rather damage inanimate objects than people). I ask where my dad is and walk to there bedroom and he said he's fine and to not yell cause it's late. She says I don't fucking care about my father and I say fuck you as I walk back to my room.

I have a family of 2 siblings, mother and father. We used to go on roadtrips and vacations when I was young. I'm 21 years old now and my latest vacation with my dad was back in 2017 when we flew to Manchester, England. I'm european and have travelled with my family a few times in Europe. We would often go roadtripping in my homecountry.

Before I moved out, whenever they were making plans I always got an invite. Ever since I got my job, I was too focused to be a part of those plans anymore and rarely joined them.

After I moved out, those invites stopped coming. It was odd, because my family likes to do things.
But on facebook and instagram they were posting pictures and videos of them having fun abroad and stuff. At first it was okay, because of course I don't have to be with them everywhere all the time. But months passed and I hadn't been invited to any event or vacation what so ever. Except from a few holidays, and me and my brother hang out all the time. We basically listen to new music and play video games 2-3 times a week but he never speaks about any plans my family has.

Yesterday my dad accidentally revealed to me when I texted him, that next week they're travelling again. I have never confronted my family about this issue until yesterday.
My brother and I hung out last time on friday and he didn't mention they were going to travel. So I asked him why I wasn't invited and he just laughed...

Basically, I'm not allowed to follow them because I have moved out and have full a time job. That is literally his explanation. I felt that was ridiculous and we argued for a long time.

He said I shouldn't expect to be invited or even asked anymore... because I live on my own now.
That's why neither of my parents or siblings haven't included me in their travelling plans/events etc. I feel so disappointed and don't know how go react.

Is he right? The conversation didn't end well and now we're not talking.

I know he's constantly on Reddit and hope he sees this.

The way I see it, I pay just as much as fun for an apartment and I live here, but you can really go anywhere else and vape.

my kids have been asking questions about why auntie is staying with us and why she is having nightmares. 

I sat them down and explained it in the most kid friendly way I could.

I just explained that auntie was in a relationship where her boyfriend was not nice, I sorta explained why. 
I then also got them to watch the consent tea video and explained to them how they needed to speak up if they saw anything. 

I can agree that I did it kinda out of the blue but just assumed it would be fine. 

turns out my wife is pissed off and told me I went to far and that it's not a topic for the kids to learn. she wanted me to not mention it around them.

The restaurant accepts to-go orders, but it was clearly not something that all of the employees were familiar with. They were very busy, and the narrow entrance where orders are placed was filled with employees and customers constantly coming and going. They didn’t have any special seating for to-go orders, and the food takes roughly 15 minutes to come out, so after I placed the order I decided to sit at an open table right by the entrance and left my to-go receipt on the table to avoid confusion. 

After a few minutes I noticed that the server in that section passed by and looked at me flustered. I realized that the table must be hers and that I was taking up her table, and thus negating any tips she might have received from diners who otherwise would have been seated there.

c4148y	2019-06-23 08:35:35		WIBTA if I ended a friendship cuz she's (gay) taking advantage of our straight friend?	"In high school (I’m about to finish college now), I had a Spanish exchange student. I’ve spent 10 years studying Spanish so I was ecstatic to have an exchange student and be able to practice with him/learn about his culture. He lived with me for 3 months and we became good friends. Let’s call him Eduardo. 

Eduardo asked to cme back the next summer for 2 weeks but my mom said no. We’re really poor and the first time he stayed with us broke the bank as it was another mouth to feed and there was a ton of pressure to go to amusement parks and tourist attractions. My mom said yes the first time cuz the school cldnt find enough host families and was super desperate (and she knew how excited I was). But she cldnt do it a 2nd time, so Eduardo stayed with my best friend, Alyssa. Alyssa has no interest in Spanish and just offered the couch because her family was out of town during the time and it seemed fun. 

Alyssa’s family is very wealthy and so is Eduardo’s. His whole family did a month long tour of the country after his 2 week stay at Alyssa’s house, so Alyssa organized a fancy dinner to introduce their parents. She didn’t even think to invite me or my mom even though we’re the reason Eduardo could come here in the first place. As a result his family completely forgot that mine exists despite him staying with us for 6 times as long. They didnt even send a thank you email but bought nice gifts for Alyssa’s parents, who weren't even home when she stayed there. I was upset about this dinner and I brought it up to Alyssa who invited me afterwards but I declined because it seemed like I had forced my way in.

The thing is, Eduardo likes Alyssa and constantly flirts with her. Alyssa is gay and has been leading him on for the past few years (we all talk daily). Eduardo was constantly inviting us to visit Spain and I always declined because I absolutely cant afford it. Then last year I found out that his family bought plane tickets for Alyssa. She hasn’t learned any Spanish (besides random phrases she says to boast about how her accent is better than mine despite me literally studying it for 10 years). The worst part is, Eduardo is expecting this trip to be romantic and his chance to make a move and she’s totally 100% gay. She knows that Eduardo is expecting this but hey, free trip right? 

I’m 30% mad about the trip and 70% mad that she’s taking advantage of Eduardo by leading him on romantically to get the free trip she could afford herself. I wish that Alyssa just been more considerate abt the whole situation. If Eduardo had offered me the free tickets I probably would have declined out of politeness, but Alyssa didn’t even think to invite my family to the dinner or to maybe not accept the tickets knowing that’d be a dream come true for me.

I only see Alyssa a few times a year now and I’m honestly considering just ending the friendship off. The trip is next month and Idk if I can bare to watch all their social media posts. WIBTA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Basically I explain that in addition to my everyday tasks, I also took on the social media part of the company. Built up a following, engaged people, blah blah blah. The job I'm applying for has nothing to do with social media, but of course the big wig sees shiny gold stars around me since he wants to launch the social media side of his business. So yeah, I get hired since I'm a fantastic interviewee and out of desperation agreed that I would help him get them likes. Boy I wish I hadn't. 


Tip: Don't agree to take on extra tasks unless these fuckers agree to pay you extra. 


Anyway, the department that I'm in hates and want nothing to do with it. Cool, whatever; more on that in a sec. Anyhow, since day one, the boss man at the top is dropping hints about wanting to tap into social media with me. He even buys me all the fancy equipment while I'm still learning the regular job. I'm a bit overwhelmed because the regular job duties are a pretty heavy load to take on, especially as a new guy. I'm kinda shy though so I just roll with it and I'm basically like, ""yeah let's do it man!"" At the time I have no idea what the hell else to say to this guy. 


We go a couple more weeks with the back and forth hints of launching but nothing's official. 


Since being employed, I keep getting pulled into meetings every week with the boss and supervisors about ongoing IT projects. Boss man at the top is annoyed that I'm not contributing to the discussion in meetings. Like I said, I'm kinda reserved and at the moment a little overwhelmed since I'm the low man on the totem pole. He keeps making little side comments that irk me a bit, and in short have me going home thinking I'm a lazy asshole. 


So finally one meeting he asks for my opinion on what we should take on next, and I'm like ""ok let's launch the social media project."" He obviously has a boner for that stuff so I figured I'm telling him what he wants to hear. We have $500 worth of equipment ready to go anyhow. 


My immediate supervisor basically lays into me shortly after, basically calling me a fucking idiot because I should have told him before I brought a new suggestion to the table. That's fair. Thing is, why bring me into these meetings where the guy in charge is looking at me sideways because I keep to myself, and why dump hundreds of dollars of media shit in my office when I've been there since breakfast?


Basically my confidence is shot. Big boss doesn't seem to think much of me. Supervisor is fuming that I told boss what he wants to hear. And I'm pretty sure the team thinks I'm a joke since they love to talk. Not like they're the ones getting dragged into those fucking meetings.

So I texted with this guy a month or so. We then met in person and it was a wonderful first date. It had everything, great convos, sexual chemistry, same sense of humor. He asked to see me again which we did a week later. Again it was the same and we also had sex and I slept at his house. Afterwards we continued texting like regularly, our convos continued. So a few days later I asked him if he wants to do smth in the next days, he said yes I have time on the weekend. I said weekend sounds great! He was like goood! Now on friday I didn’t heard anything from him although he normally texted everyday. The days before his messages got a little less. Saturday almost noon and still nothing so I hit him up with a text and asked hey how are you are we still meeting up so I can plan my weekend, something like this. He then said that I better plan something else because he is tired. At this point I felt blewn off, I mean what‘s the oldest excuse to not see someone? Probably tiredness. I was a little disappointed so I said well would have been nicer to knew that before so I could have planned my weekend better and that he could’ve said no instead of a excuse. My friends already were like: you guys had sex, now he‘s too tired to meet up he‘s just not that into you! Then he send me a text that if I mean by excuse that he rather wants to chill and sleep then yes I am right and that he can send me a picture or video of him chilling. He also didn’t tryed to reschedule nor said sorry for making plans and not going through. At this point I realized how stupid this is and that I didn’t meant he was doing something else instead of meeting me. So I wished him a nice day and said I definitely don’t want a picture and that I didn’t meant it like that. So aita for being disappointed for flaky behavior? And probably he‘s just not that into you. Obviously I haven’t heard from him since then. 

LT;DR: met a guy two times, hit it off. I ask him if we do something he says yes on the weekend. Then I don’t hear from him, only when I had to ask. Now he probably thinks I am AITA and crazy."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c40zjk	2019-06-23 08:19:41	random_question_1	AITA - Want to buy expensive jewelry and husband wants to spend less.	"I know this is a materialistic want. But below is my story

Had an argument with husband over buying of jewelry and wanted you opinion on this.

Facts

1. Arranged Marriage been married for 5 years had our first kid 8 months back. Everything going pretty decent
2. Husband paid for my school (\~50k)
3. We bought a house recently in bay area he paid the downpayment. I spent probably around 20-30% of downpayment on remodeling
4. He earns 3-4 times of what I earn
5. I tried going back to work after maternity leave for 3 months but decided to take a break for 3-4 months as between taking care of  a new born and remodeling and changing jobs twice due to relocating to the new house I was exhausted. Husband supports 100% with this decision
6. We have around X $$ in cash and 2X $$ in stock.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the above but wanted to give a very detailed background.

&#x200B;

I did not buy anything jewelry or ask for anything  else in these 6 years. He did take me for a vacation to Europe purely for my sake.

So basically I am going to my home country and wanted to buy some expensive jewelry (i agree 100% that this can be postponed). But I have a party coming up of my kid (I am the host) and really want to buy it as I will probably not have another party in my home country for another 10-15 years.

&#x200B;

Husband so far bought me a diamond solitaire 3 years back and that is the only money he spent on my jewelry in close to 6 years of marriage.  My entire purchase spend  would be around 6-8% of money of what we have currently (His salary and stocks are the major funds).  He did not say No to it but we argued over how much can I spend money. I had an amount in mind and he wants me to spend half of it.

&#x200B;

I agree that this is a materialistic want but I feel this is something we can totally afford but he is being over cautious. The argument went over to me comparing with my peer group and he saying that we just bought the house and need a buffer. But I want to really have the piece of jewelry for the party.

&#x200B;

Even though I have close to 4 -5 times the funds  to funnel my purchase in my personal account I want to take the decision as a family.

&#x200B;

Am i being the mean for asking to buy the jewelry.

"Long story short, my (19m) reddit friend (27m) (met not more than 2 months ago) confessed he has a crush on me a while ago and that he loves me and cant live without me, keep in mind we never met and hes in a different country. He is very strict about who i talk to, hang out with, what i wear etc i explained to him i dont want a relationship and i am avoiding all sort of relationships due to some personal problems. I did say i cant promise i wont be having sex or anything with my friend (a friend i usually have sex with when we both single cuz we dont do hookups).

The reddit friend told me before to not let any of my friends sleep next to me on my bed, cause i usually let them if they are too tired to go home or too scared to leave at night, always did it ever since i moved out, my place is where my friends hangout in. Anyways my friend who i mentioned i have sex with, took me home from a nightclub and he was tired we talked about stuff, madeout and slept on my bed next to me.

I texted my reddit friend and told him i was in a club and my friend is sleeping next to me, he got mad at me and upset and asked me to promise nothing more would happen.. i mentioned we did kiss and i cannot promise nothing would happen and now hes pretty upset, called me a liar, promise breaker and ghosted me. 

So, am i an asshole for doing what i did? I like him but we are not together and i never led him on and we talked about it many times.. even on reddit he would ask for ss if he knew i speak to anyone else beside him... etc"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I had a couple drinks more than I expected, R didn't (he's under aged) so when we were getting ready to leave I asked him to drive us back. We're like 5 mins into the drive and at a red light, all the sudden, when the light turns green R floors the accelerator.... like really floors it to point that my car made a really loud sound. (This is my 3rd car in the past few years due to getting in an accident or mechanical problems with other cars when I was younger that caused the car's to not be worth fixing... so I've spent a lot of money over the past years on buying used cars so because of that I can be pretty cautious about driving safe and not getting in any avoidable accidents.... he is fully aware of all of this btw) So I asked him to not do that, but throughout the rest of our ride he kept flooring it and speeding around sharp turns or through intersections. So eventually I kinda got mad and annoyed at him and he ended up pulling over and just saying that I should drive the rest of the way home....

TLDR: AITA for possibly overreacting and getting upset that my brother kept flooring my car and speeding after I asked him not to, even though I was the one who asked him to drive us home bc I was a tipsy

c40z4g	2019-06-23 08:18:11		AITA for not being willing to swallow $35 on a phone charger i'll barely use for a month?	"This is seriously petty but I don't care. I'm protective over my money because in the past, my dad tends to ""borrow"" money and not return it. I finished chasing him up for the money he promised me back over the past few years & he pulled $18 dollars out of my account the other day, only giving me ten. I don't trust him with shit, love him dearly but he's just awful with money.

Recently, my sisters (f11) phone charger completely fucked out. I (f16) have been letting her use mine for about two weeks until mine completely fucked out too. It's been a little annoying and we've bickered over it but overall, she's had her phone charged so she can remain in contact with my parents while walking too and from school.

My phone is on it's last legs (iPhone 5c), I'm buying a new one soon with my money. The thing is, I need my phone alive and charged for now in case work calls me in for a shift. It was too late to get a $5 charger, so I had to go to the gas station and have a look at theirs.

It was $35 but it was good quality. I didn't care about the quality but my dad pressured me into getting one because my sister will use it in the future. He flippantly said he'll pay me half of her share and I agreed so I could get out of the gas station.

I get home and I'm not happy about it because I'll barely be using this stupid fucking charger. It might be good quality but I just wanted one cheap so I can save up for a new phone. I tell my mum and both she and my dad start going off at me about my bad attitude (because I'm angry about spending so much money on it) and I say that I'm not willing to swallow such a large amount of money on a charger I'll barely use.

My parents start trying to guilt me into just biting the cost and I'm fuming. I tell them I'm not doing that and holy shit, I got such a dirty look from them. I love my sister but there is no way in hell I'm letting a $35 charger slide. 

I at least want half of it paid back because we're sharing this, plus another quarter of the price once it's been given to her. That comes out to $17.50 this week and then another $8.75 when given to her properly. My parents think I'm being a selfish money hungry bitch like my uncle (a frugal bastard) but I figured that I earned the money and I'm trying to save my money to get a new phone. That comes out to literally $26.25 cents, saving almost $10 off the original price.

If they don't agree, I'm not giving her the charger and they can spend another $35 on a charger for her. I'm not her parent, I don't care about ""handing it down in the family"". This is money I earned, I'm not spending $35 on her. Love her to bits but once given to her, she'll break it within no time. $8.50 is a fair deficit and I'm fine with losing out on that amount of money."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Now it seems we can't have a conversation unless it revolves around her children. She will literally shoehorn them in anyway she can. 

We don't hang out alone ever anymore, she not only invites her kids but her husband too (no problem with him but we're a big group of girls that still enjoys daytime drinking, rude jokes and moaning about our partners and sometimes we want it to stay that way).  

She isn't the only mother of the group and yet it's safe to say she's doing all our heads in with it. She certainly isn't as close to any of us as she used to be because of it. 

Occasionally, we'll invite her out only for her to make up an excuse - usually she can't afford it or she's got the flu - only to take her kids on an expensive excursion the same or the next day.

I've had to hide her off social media now - I'm sick of her preaching. I could understand if she was the mother of newborn children but her eldest is 7.

I love kids, but I don't exacly keep it a secret that I'm not a fan of over-bearing parents, who lose every shred of their own identity as soon as parenthood hits. She seems to get the message but it doesn't deter her.

I shouted over the fence to keep the noise down as it was late and their neighbours either side, as well as us, have young children.  Nobody answered apart from a very quiet ‘piss off’. I go back inside the house and 5 minutes later it’s the same again, so I stick my head over the fence and asked quite firmly to stop shouting and turn the music down a bit. I made it quite clear I wasn’t asking them to stop completely, just to have a little more consideration for the neighbours and wind it down.

To add context, we live in a middle class, suburban area in England, the gardens are not very big at all, their bar is around 11ft from the back of my house.

c40uyc	2019-06-23 08:02:27	K8eg0li33	AITA for letting my boyfriend sleep over even though it inexplicably bothers my housemate?	"My housemate and I have been living together for about a year and a half. She suddenly has decided that she does not like my boyfriend sleeping over as often as he does (which admittedly is quite often). They are (were) friends as well, so he is not a stranger to her. She has told me that it is ""disruptive"" to her life, though she has never explained how, despite me asking each time this has been brought up. 

My boyfriend is never in the common areas of the house. Only in my room, behind a closed door, only at night when we are sleeping. We go out most evenings, and only come back to my place to sleep. She also is rarely home in the evenings (she is a barfly), and also only comes home to sleep. He does not leave anything in the rest of the house. They come face to face maybe once or twice a week for less than a minute in passing (now that my boyfriend knows she doesn't like him there, he avoids her as much as possible despite the fact we used to all be friends).

I could understand how he would be disruptive if he were hanging out on the couch or taking up the bathroom, etc. But he literally only stays in my room to sleep, and maybe take a piss in the morning before leaving. I don't think we are loud as that has never been brought up in the complaint.

When she initially brought it up, I told her that I don't think she has a right to dictate who is in my room or when, if they are not affecting her or getting in her way, and I would give her that same respect of her room as well. 

When asking her HOW his presence behind a closed door of my room bothers her, she says I'm ""arguing semantics"" (?????).  I have offered to compromise if she could explain what the issue is, but again, I haven't gotten a direct answer about that.

Now, my boyfriend and I mostly avoid her, but she has just gone to the landlord and it has created this big drama, and she's telling me she wants me to move out because I am ""not living civilly"" with her by ""brushing [her] off.""

Am I the asshole for thinking and telling her I should be allowed to have whomever I want in my own room whenever I want, especially when she won't explain WHY or HOW it is ""disruptive"" to her??

My brother recently received as close to a full ride as a texan D3 school can give for a sports scholarship to play football at the reigning D3 champions school. He never really wanted to play in college, but there was no other way he was getting funding for school, so it was play a year or take out loans.

I don't feel like I'm being a jerk, but I asked for $300 a month to live with me. This is primarily just to offset costs for groceries, inflated electric, water, consumables like laundry detergent, etc. I'm not seeking to profit off my brother, but I also don't want to be freeloaded off of as well.

Between you and I, dear reddit, I had discussed this with my now girlfriend thoroughly and we only calculated the necessary extra costs to be about $150 a month, but not long ago we read about a great story of a mom charging her son rent while he was in college and then gave it all back to him when he graduated - we wanted to apply the same concept here, but I never even got to explain any of this to my father. He heard I was charging my brother rent and lost his mind. The actual text conversation went like this:

Dad: $300 a month? You're ridiculous.

Dad: That's shitty. He's your brother, not a damn friend.

Dad: I just don't get you sometimes. I know we failed you as parents

Dad: Don't even respond. I am done with you.

<he blocked me after this, I didn't get to respond>

&#x200B;

I tried to relay a new message to him through his now wife, who insisted I was being hateful and refused to get involved. Honestly she's fitting right in with the family because clearly I can't rely on her help either. My grandma called me a jerk and hung up and didn't bother to let me talk either. To top it off, I think our 3rd brother has been refusing to pay me for a wasted convention ticket that he backed out of 12 hours prior to, under guidance of our father to do so.

Maybe I'm being unreasonable though, because clearly my entire family is stacked against me on this, with the exception of the brother who is actually moving in (he was siding with me, he didn't think I was being unfair). So Reddit, am I the asshole here?

Tl;dr - asked my brother who is moving in for $300 a month to offset the cost of him living here, entire family went up in flames."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

"So there was a concert that I went to that was the runner up to ‘ The Voice.’ He sang and played a lot of country music, which I don’t really like, but was okay with. I was maybe 4 people from the front and eventually made my way to the front with my 3 other friends since people in the front were leaving.
After a while I felt a push on my left shoulder. There was a guy making way for someone else in a wheelchair. Okay, I guess you can’t see that well and I’ll move a bit out of the way for you since you’re in a wheelchair. The guy in a wheelchair was in the second row and kind of dancing to the music. Someone tried to put him on his shoulders so he could see 100%. After a while I felt a hand push my left side. The guy in the wheelchair was trying to shove me out of the way from his view of the concert. I just stood my ground and tried my best not to be budged.

c40ojs	2019-06-23 07:38:27	vampire_bloodborn	AITA for trying to get Anxiety meds with no insurance and not complaining about my problems until now?	"I grew up in a home that believed having any mental problems made you ""broken"" or ""subhuman"" it was cold, heartless, and outright disturbing at times due to their comments and made me afraid and ashamed to seek help.

I left as soon as I could and found a great partner however they grew up on a farm and was a firm believer in ""just walk it off and if you can't rest for the day and pick it up tomorrow"" being low on money but having too much income for assistance lead us to decide to simply not have insurance and not go to a doctor for anything.

So far we've been lucky but here's the issue. I know I have anxiety but I don't know how bad due to never being properly tested... I just know being an adult man and staying up all night puking my guts out and unable to sleep because I forgot to do a minor task at work so I convince myself I'd be fired from it... isn't normal.

I've hit my head to the point I was temporarily blinded, head bleeding and unable to think clearly for two weeks and my partner simply said ""it's probably a concussion. Nothing they can do just fight through it"" I did and a month later I was close enough to perfectly fine.

The issue is my Anxiety is getting worse. At first it was a queasy stomach, shaking and nervous if I knew I did something wrong, then it turned into full on vomit if I even thought something was going to go wrong... Now I'm constantly afraid that maybe I failed somewhere weeks ago and no one told me yet or even minor shit like shopping makes me nauseated because I'm afraid I'll get the wrong thing, forget something, or my card will mess up disappointing everyone. I hate driving, I hate shopping, work has become a nightmare because schedules have been late and I never know what part of the city I'll be needed in from one week to the next, 24 hour shifts on occasion due to short staff, and new rules, new monthly meetings etc... I'm going nuts! 

I need to get checked out but my partner is trying natural cures to no end and no avail. Lavender, tea, baths, you name it he's tried it on me to make me calm down he keeps telling me we can't afford the doctor visits or the medication without insurance. That I need to just ""clear my head and breathe"" because he thinks breathing properly is a cure all to almost everything... He means well, he really does but getting wrapped up in a blanket with candles lit and chamomile tea only goes so far... I need something that will last all day. 

He and my friends are 100% against me getting meds due to the cost and the fact I used to abuse pills. They're afraid it will bring back old habits and cause more suffering in the end... I'm thinking about not holding it in one day so they can truly see what I'm going through, send me to the hospital and finally get some professional help."	Not the A-hole	0	0	51.0	14.0	0.0	0.0

My mum was already upset that I was looking at Universities that are so far away. I was really surprised when she was okay with the one that I found, which from what I knew was far away from any family I have. But I later found out that her boyfriends parents (who I have never met, and I don't even like her boyfriend) live near there and she was going to send them to check up on me periodically. I thought I was in the right to be upset by this, as the whole reason I want to move away is to become my own person. My family life hasn't always been the greatest, and I've always planned on moving away as I currently live in a small rural town that has no possibility for growth in the direction I want to go. Now, just last night, we were talking about Uni and she asks if I'm sure there is no way I could do my degree in my town (there is not). I tell her so, but also remind her that I want to move away because I *want* to live on my own. She gets upset, asking 'why I don't like her' and 'why I want to move away from her' (even though none of that is true. I love her dearly and even made the tough choice to stay with her despite my dad and brother moved 5 hours away), and adds ""you know that if I weren't with \[her boyfriend\] I would be moving up there with you, right?"". Is it bad that I don't want that to happen? Because she got really upset when I said that I wouldn't want her to do that and I want to live by myself, but other members in my family are telling me that I should be considerate of her and try to live closer? They aren't even taking in to account that I would also be leaving my dad, who lives about 5 hours away from me and is supportive of my choice to move away despite already being upset that we live so far apart? I don't even know why she would want to move, she has a great job here in which she recently got a promotion, and most of her family lives here. She would also be moving further away from my younger brother, who still have 3 more years of high school and wants to continue living around that area. They say I should at least have a Gap year with her, even though I already live with her? I just don't know, am I a bad person for not wanting my mum to move cities with me?"

c40lx1	2019-06-23 07:28:44	deeckz	AITA for holding on to the life insurance payout I got from my estranged aunt who forgot to remove me as her beneficiary after we fought and stopped talking?	"My Aunt Celine was my Mom’s older sister. She was married to my Uncle Ben but they did not have children. Ten years ago they sold a property that was inherited by Uncle Ben for a large amount of money, and they decided to get life insurance policies. They are each other’s primary beneficiaries, and as I was Aunt Celine’s favorite niece back then, she named me their secondary beneficiary. 

About two years ago, Aunt Celine and I fought and stopped talking. I know she loved me and she helped our family financially, but she was very pushy with her ‘traditional’ and ‘conservative’ views as one of those people who thought that they get to be right just because they’re older. I tried to be as respectful and understanding as I could, but when she told me that I should only give my dad $100 every month to buy his food and medicine and I should stop buying him ‘luxuries’ like clothes and shoes (from outlet stores) because he and my mom are estranged and he needs to be taught a lesson, I snapped and told her she had no right to dictate what relationship I want to have with my own father. She was enraged at my disrespect. Since then, we have not spoken. A few months ago, she and Uncle Ben sadly passed in an traffic accident. 

In their wills, they left money to their nephews and nieces except for me, the niece who talked back, and my sister, the lesbian. Both of us don’t really care. However, there is the issue of their life insurance policy. The payout is a substantial amount, and apparently, since Aunt Celine never removed me as the second beneficiary and she and Uncle Ben passed together, the money is mine. 

When Uncle Ben’s family (his sisters and their children) found out about the insurance policy, they called my mother and told her that I should give them the payout. They said it was unfair that I would get the money since Aunt Celine made it clear that she didn’t want to leave me or my sister anything and their source of wealth is the sale of the property that Uncle Ben inherited from his parents.

My mother talked to me about it, but I’m thinking that this money is legally mine and I am under no obligation to give it to anyone. I didn't force Aunt Celine to name me the beneficiary then, and my mother even pointed out that maybe it would be better if she also named one of her nieces from Uncle Ben’s side as co-secondary beneficiary, but Aunt Celine just said that one secondary beneficiary is enough. It’s not my fault that she didn’t remove me as the beneficiary after we stopped talking. Also, Aunt Celine and Uncle Ben left money to my cousins, the children of my mother's other sister, so clearly they wanted to leave them something, but Uncle Ben's family wants me to give the money only to them and not to my cousins. How is that 'fair' if I go by their definition of fairness?

c40kwq	2019-06-23 07:24:56	saltstorm100	AITA for telling an employee she's not good enough at her job in front of her coworkers?	"Background: I am the manager of a sports bar, so all of my employees are anywhere from 18-27 year old females. They are all very pretty, wear cheerleader uniforms, and most of them don't even need the job but their parents are making them work.

A couple of months ago, we hired a girl (21 y/o), we'll call her Eve.

Every single week, Eve comes to me to talk about her work problems and why she's not making money. Every week I tell her the same thing: you need to have a better attitude, be a team player, take your tables! She always complains that she doesn't make much, but she never wants to take tables, she doesn't run food, run drinks, get ice, roll silverware, etc... Every. Single. Week.

Last week, she complained to me that she thought nobody at work liked her. I brought her to the office and explained that she needed to be a team player and help her coworkers out with running duties. She agreed, we had a good shift.

I've always felt like she was just an attention-seeker. Looking for any reason at all to be noticed. Anyway...

Cut to the beginning of the shift tonight:  One of the other girls didn't show up for work, so I asked Darla* to move into that section, because it's a closing section and Darla is a great server and said she needed to make money. Win - win. Ten minutes later, the hostess informed me that Eve was going to trade sections with Darla and close. I track down Eve.

Me: That's not how it works. You can't swap sections without asking a manager. Who did you run this by?

Eve: ... Darla...

Me: Well, that's not going to happen tonight. It's Saturday night.

Eve: Why?

Me: To be honest, you're too slow and I'm closing tonight and have to be back at 8AM to open and I don't want to be here that late. Maybe another time.

Eve goes to the bathroom to cry. One of the other girls tells me about this, so I go try to console her and she doesn't answer me back, so I walk out.

Honestly, I don't feel bad because I've had sooo many conversations with her about her performance already and she tried to finesse her way into a better section without consulting another manager.

She exits the bathroom after about five more minutes and approaches the other manager on duty, saying she feels management should speak to her with more respect. I feel like I was just being honest, I tried to apologize and just because she didn't get her way, she got upset.

c40k3c	2019-06-23 07:21:53		AITA for being mad at my long time friend?	"Hi there so for starters as context, I’m a 21 year old guy, and my friend is a 21 year old girl. Me and her have been friends for the last 4-5 years ranging back from Junior year of high school, at no point have we dated or had any history in that way, were strictly friends. On to the story. 

Tonight me and her went out to dinner to just have some drinks n dinner, and just have a fun time together. She was short on funds and I recently got a well paying job (for me at least), and don’t have lots of bills, so I offered to pay if we went out. So we pregame a bit at my house, go to dinner, all is well. 

Last week when we hung out, doing this same thing, drinks and dinner, when we went back to my house after she ended up FaceTiming two guys she’s interested in, that I don’t know so I just sat there and patiently waited for her to be done. After 2 hours she finally got off, and we talked for like 10 minutes and went to bed (I had offered for her to stay because we were both pretty drunk). Nothing really came out of that, I thought it was a little rude but I never mentioned it and moved on, thought it was just a one time thing and wouldn’t be a problem.

Cut back to tonight, were out at dinner and I told her about how I felt about last week when she did that, she said she was sorry and understood why I was mad. I made her promise she wouldn’t do it tonight, and she immediately promised she wouldn’t. She asked if she could spend the night in the guest room again and I said yes. A drink later, I’m pretty tipsy, so is she so I pay and call the Uber, we get back to my place and I told her I’d grab us some ice cream, I had gone to the store earlier cause I knew we would be drunk and want snacks. Immediately she goes into the guest room and gets on FaceTime with a guy she was talking about (another one than the other 2 from last week). I said “really?” And just left it at that for now. 15 minutes pass and she’s talking to him about various things but topics like wanting to do anal, and how “big” he is come up in the call. She randomly asks me a few questions during the conversation that relate to what she’s talking about and I just rolled my eyes and told her I was annoyed she’s doing this. So I got up and went to my room for the time being. 

I wait, and 10 minutes pass without any word or text from her so I text and ask why she broke the promise she made and why she’s being so inconsiderate to me. She replies “I’m hanging up, he’s being irritating”. so I wait 15 more minutes and then go back to the guest room to confront her. I ask what she’s doing and she says she’s trying to get off the phone, same this as 15 minutes ago apparently. I told her she’s being really rude and inconsiderate, and if she’s not gonna get off the phone, then wait til she’s sober and just leave. 

AITA? In my view and my opinion I think she’s being rude as all shit and completely immature, yet she’s somehow mad at me like I’m in the wrong, AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c40jm3	2019-06-23 07:19:58		AITA for crying at work and making a co-worker uncomfortable?	"So, I saw a post about something similar a while back on here, so I thought I'd share my own story, and get your opinions. Let my judgement be whatever it may.

TL;DR: I messed up at work. I was tired and frustrated, and before I could stop myself, I started crying, making a co-worker uncomfortable.

So, I (20F) work in a pharmacy. I'm relatively new to the position- about three months in- and I'm still learning things about the job. Admittedly, when I'm tired or stressed, I get a bit airheaded. This whole week has been nonstop stress, and by the end of Friday night, I was done. 

Ten minutes before close, the pharmacy gets a phone call. It's a frantic-sounding female patient asking when we close. I told her it was in ten minutes, and she said she'd try to be there as soon as possible.

We have two registers in my pharmacy, and I usually close both about five minutes before closing time. I had already closed one drawer when a man runs up to the counter, saying he had a pickup for (First Name of Female Caller). He gave the first name and DOB, and without thinking about it, I put in the last name. If you've worked in a pharmacy, you'd know this is a big no-no. I was tired and ready to leave, and I acted without thinking.

Well, after I ring the man up and he leaves with the medication, my pharmacist- who was watching the entire exchange- comes over and lets me know that I fucked up. I apologized and closed the second register, and my pharmacist shut down the pharmacy and left.

Here's where the AITA came in.

I have a bad habit of crying whenever I get frustrated or flustered. It's embarassing, and I hate it, but it's not something I can control very well. The rule of thumb for where I work is that at least two people need to be with a register drawer to walk it back to the cash office. So, whenever I close, my shift ends with me waiting around for another employee to walk me to the back. This time, when said employee came around, I was crying and visibly upset. Not sobbing or making noise- just crying, with a very red face.

He seemed extremely uncomfortable, and asked if I was alright. I told him I was, and we went back to the cash office. Ever since, he hasn't spoken to me, even when he comes to help me walk the drawers.

" I liked this girl (F) and soon the truth came out and she told me she liked me too but she had this dude and because of him she couldnt date me. So over time me and F became closer and talked more and more during school. F had a best friend who was like a sister to her (FBF) and I started talking to FBF a lot and F soon got jealous and started to stop talking to FBF and gave her mean looks. During school F would say her bio class were torture for her since she and I didn't sit together due to assigned seating and I would talk to FBF who I've been friends with for a few months.with FBF when I shouldn't. At a winter party another girl asked to wear a hoodie I had on, and so I gave it to her. Me and F still hung out, but after the party F got mad at me for giving the hoodie to another girl. Over winter break things became a bit different with her starting to say,""I miss you"" and flirting, and started becoming possessive and needy from me, she would always want me to reply in under 2 minutes no matter what I was doing and got mad that I didn't say,""I miss you"" at least 6 times a day. I soon told some of my friends about how she was acting and how I thought it was needy, but one of my friends told her but then me and that same friend said he was joking and it was a coincidence, and she believed it. A few weeks go by and then my same friend who told her last time actually told everyone this time due to having screenshots and our whole friend group knew of what F and I said to each other. This sparks a huge argument between F and I but it soon gets resolved of me saying I wouldn't do it again. F stopped saying ""I miss you"" and would sometimes vent to me about the Mormon dude and how he's acting like her bf and is being annoying. I talk to another girl (F2) about my relationship with F and in the same time help F2 with her crush. F goes through my phone when I'm not looking and looks through me and F2's convo and sees me talking to F2 about her and she gets mad yet again. She made comments about how I don't make any effort with her anymore and how I was the sweetest boy who ever entered her life, and how she embarrasses herself trying to talk to me. We soon makeup but we aren't as close as we are before. I still talk to FBF who then F gets mad about and called me an asshole for talking to FBF she calms down after I tell her that I didn't have any feelings for FBF. Soon our conversations become very dry and forced asking the same questions without actually going in depth on them and I'm getting bored, but don't want to say anything since I was scared to hurt her feelings, since everything I tried to do was always with her happiness in my mind. Soon I tell her I'm taking a break from everything but really I'm just trying to take a break from her, since I was sad her and I didn't talk as much since she didn't carry on conversations."

There was this math teacher, Mr. Alan (not his real name), who I had when I was in the ninth grade. In the first few months, everything seemed to he okay, but then after a while, things just started to take a completely different turn. 

So one day when I was in class, I asked to go to the toilet. As soon as I went to the toilet and was doing my business, I saw him standing right outside, talking on his phone while he waited for me. I was a bit weirded out by this, but it happened a few other times as well. 

Then the other day I go to the toilet and come back from the class, he has other students in my class search through my belongings and question me about them. I try to lie about it because it's my property and personal belongings, but they still try to probe me about it. There was even one time he asked the students to hide my bag and play a game of ""hot"" and ""cold"" (i.e. If I was close to my bag, they'd say ""hot""). 

There are of course a few times I'm often made fun of in front of the class, either by embarrassing me for something I've asked for help on, prompting other people to laugh at me. 

Of course, the cumulative weight of all of this does annoy me and I try to tell him to stop. Other students say ""quit taking it so seriously, you're overreacting, we're just messing around with you"". I try to tell one of my teachers about this, but he also says ""quit taking it so seriously"". 

I was at home one day, and of course a classmate called me for no apparent reason. Little did I know that my math teacher took my classmates phone and put me on loudspeaker for the whole class to hear. 

Of course, I am pretty angry with his attitude and proceed to call him a ""coward"" for his actions. I ended up getting called into the principals office about this, and there I share my story about what was happening in the math class. The school formally warns my math teacher to leave me alone, and when other people hear about this, they then say ""you're so damn sensitive, we were just joking"".

c40dox	2019-06-23 06:58:36	curtis080609	WIBTA if I stopped listening to my friend vent?	"We're both males in our late 20's. Obligatory apology for being on mobile.

Background: My friend likes to vent to me and our other friends about his many ongoing issues, which is NOT a problem in itself. I have been a very patient listener for over 10 years.

I will admit the following: I should mention first and foremost that this man is one of the kindest people I have ever met when he isn't complaining about his problems. Would literally give you the shirt off his back if needed.

Now, he has lived a very hard life and deserves a vent every now and then. He didn't really ever take our advice, but we were always there to listen and that's fine. He's not obligated to take our advice and I wanted to be a good friend.

What changed: in the last year or so, he has been telling us about the same issues over and over. However, these are the same issues he's had for close to a decade at this point. Patience is admittedly getting thin amongst our friend group, especially since he seems to refuse to fix them.

In an attempt to help him in this seemingly deep rooted problem, I recommended seeking counseling/therapy. It worked for me, so I offered it up as an option. He was not obligated take my advice and I made sure he knew that, but then he said some things that will lead me to my question.

He began to heavily imply that therapy is for weak minded people. I don't think he intended to offend me, but it definitely didn't sit well.

I dropped the subject because I didn't want to say something I would regret. I needed to calm down before I said anything.

A couple of days later, I was in the room when he was venting to a mutual friend of ours. Our mutual friend ALSO recommended therapy and he kind of scoffed at it. He went on a small rant of ""taking on his problems HEAD ON!"" or whatever. I was so annoyed at this point that I just stopped listening.

I'm starting to think he just enjoys playing the victim and I don't want to enable it going forward. WIBTA if I shut down these venting sessions going forward?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	306.0	20.0	0.0	0.0
c40cwz	2019-06-23 06:55:45	YamchasSidePiece	AITA for not speaking to my dad?	"I have two older siblings, one brother and one sister. Our dad wasn't a huge part of our lives (he lived in a different state, we sometimes visited for summers) until sister (14) and I (13) had to move into his house. My brother (20ish) had already been living there for a couple of years.

When I was 17, I started dating my first boyfriend, Greg. Greg and I had started hanging out after school. I followed the typical dumb teenager route and often lied about my whereabouts, saying I was with a girlfriend, etc. I lied because I was scared about the way my dad would react to me hanging out with Greg, not really based on anything (yet) just because of my knowledge of how 'dads' react to 'boyfriends' and I felt very awkward talking about this stuff with my dad. In retrospect, I now know that the way I was acting was dumb, it just created a bad loop of me lying and my dad freaking out and causing me to lie more because of being scared of him freaking out and then him freaking out even more.

I don't remember exactly how I told my dad about Greg, but everything got worse after that. 
I have a lot of examples of really bad stuff that happened, including tax fraud on his end and him telling everybody I lost my virginity, but I'm conserving space.

There was an instance where we were screaming at each other and I said something like, ""Do you ever care that when I'm 18 I'm never going to talk to you again?!"" To which he got up in my face and yelled, ""No, you're MY property!"" And I just sat there, dumbfounded. Two months after turning 18 I moved out, and fast forward to now, I'm 20 and still haven't spoken to my dad. He's blocked on my phone, but on some occasions a lot of his messages come through, some at night when I know he's very drunk, saying, ""Please I'm so sorry I miss you so much"" and some during the day (sober) saying stuff like, ""Hey, asshole, it's your grandmother's bday.""

Things are getting better between my siblings and I, but often they'll still bring up everything and do the, ""Oh yeah dad was crying the other day because of you again,"" stuff to make me feel bad. I'm not sure if all this was my fault or not. Greg was definitely a catalyst, but I don't think he caused this. I think my dad was not acting how a normal dad should in that situation, all he did was put me in an awful environment and caused my siblings to resent me. Everybody keeps trying to get me to talk to him (and the way they do, I believe that they blame the situation on me), but I just don't miss him or feel the need to make up. So, AITA?

c40bmj	2019-06-23 06:50:57	icyclover	AITA for icing my friend?	"I'm 22F and my friend is 23M. Just to clarify, my friend (lets call him D) is LGBTQ+, and I'm confident this is not a matter of romantic/sexual attraction.

I knew D around 5 years ago, although we only became closer about 3 years ago after realising we could click well and shared a love for cake. We would meet up occasionally to study and/or chat.

As the new semester came (2 years ago), we met each other in school on a near daily basis (except for weekends) just to study. It was then I confided in him over something that I felt slightly guilty about; that I may have been unconsciously neglecting friendships after a certain period of time.

This particular instance was about another guy friend whom I met during my after-school activity of theatre/drama. Similar to D, we hung out fairly often. As the exams ended (this was the semester before), I didn't really talk much to this other guy friend. I began to felt guilty that I was 'making use' of people, or if I were 'needy for attention'. D suggested that I may just have felt lonely and told me not to worry.

D was a good friend to me. He always brought some bread/snacks that I particularly liked for our study sessions, listened to my rants about my famiy or any other difficulties that I faced and took the time to teach me the content for the class I was taking in preparation for the mid-term exams.

Fast forward towards the end of the semester, an incident happened in my family that made me  upset and stressed. At that point, I just wanted to push the negative emotions/memories away to have some level of peace in my life. Knowing D, I knew he would spend much effort to try and cheer me up. But I didn't want that because I would be reminded of said negative emotions. I iced all his messages and later requested for some space.

D accepted this request and left me alone for about 2-3 weeks; I messaged him afterwards saying that I would probably be ok in 3 months. As that was June, that would mean early September. However, as September came, I was not ready to answer the questions he probably had, and was not ready to face the emotions that I may have somewhat associated with him as he would examine these emotions to investigate my inner subconscious feelings which I wanted to avoid.

D angrily texted me in October, and mentioned about the September deadline as well as how I was fairly active meeting other friends and posting on social media. To which I replied that it was merely just him overreacting to his anxieties about his friendship (he has some form of social anxiety and insecure attachment) and told him that I had no opportunity to look back on the incident that affected me. I also mentioned that social media didn't reflect what I felt on the inside.This seemed to cool him down, and it was easily to ice him again.

Thus far, we have not talked at all, apart from a birthday message D sent me a couple of weeks ago for my birthday. In my desire for inner peace, have I treated my friend unfairly?"	Asshole	0	0	10.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

I'm not getting married or am even engaged yet. However, I've been thinking about popping the question and the thing is that my brother disapproves of my girlfriend. He has sat me down and told me he doesnt think she's right for me. 

Now you may be thinking ""Well maybe he's on to something. What are you not telling us OP?"". But out of all 5 of my long term relationships he's given me the same talks. He doesn't approve of anyone I'm with for some reason. Obviously the other ones didn't work out but I didnt say anything because I didnt think of even marrying them. I'm a slow roller. I only would pop the question if I 2000% knew it was a good call

My current girlfriend is different however. I have been extremely happy with her for the past 4 years and am about ready for the next step. I know from talks with my family that the passive expectation is for my brother to be the best man. But why in the hell would I want someone who openly doesnt like my significant other to be my best man? That makes no sense to me.

My best friend, who we will call J, has always said that he thinks we are a great couple and sees what I see. I would want him to be my best man since he's the one I've always been able to come to with relationship stuff and supports me. Makes sense to me.

So, the story: me and my five friends (all F, three 14, one 15, one in college) were having a bible study while on a mission trip. We were all taking turns talking about our place of spiritual growth. My one friend (we’ll call her Sunflower) talked about her family problems and how it was affecting her growth. She had been crying, and we all offered Sunflower support. After a few minutes, Sunflower was fine. No crying, nothing saying “hey I’m not okay”. And let me just say one thing: I’ve known Sunflower and have been her best friend for about three years now. I know how she is and she gets over things pretty quickly. It was then my turn to talk. I was talking about my past with spirituality, but the thing is, she kept interrupting me with comments on my story, and with most of them, she started talking about her problems with her family again. Now, this just something that bothers me, but I don’t like it when people have already shared their story, said they were done, then proceed to interrupt someone talking and start going back on their story. Sunflower did this a couple times, and I was finally tired of it, so I said, “I’m sorry, but can you not?” Other friends were also getting a bit annoyed with her interrupting me, so I just deemed it necessary. I apologized after I said it, too, and she didn’t respond to it, so it just kind of made me worry. Idk, I just really feel bad in case I made her embarrassed or something. AITA?"

"Okie dokie, before I start, let me just say that I have had a rough life, however,  through every step of the way my Grandmother has been a monumental pillar in helping me keep my sanity. Even though she doesn't always have the resources to help she finds a way. I have always been low on money because I'm fully independent and in school, but she roots for me through thick and thin and I will always honor her wishes to the best of my ability. 

Soooo in February, I had applied to a month long government bursary  (which would help me graduate early) to learn french in January in another province and actually got in!!! This would take place in July. I have been saving like crazy to pay for the expenses not covered by the bursary and my grandmother knows this. 

So then in March,  I have paid my $275 non-refundable fee and the $165 train ticket for the trip (I know that may not seem like a lot to some people, but I have full time school, 190 unpaid placement hours, and part-time work) So I call my grandmother up and tell her about the great opportunity, not thinking it was that big of a deal. We talk and she's super excited for me but tells me she'll have to call me back in five mins. Okay! Five minutes later, I get a phone call and she tells me that she has something to tell me, she didn't want to tell me until ***June***, but she's getting married. And also I'm the Maid of Honor!! I love her Fiance because of the love that he has for her. She deserves it.  I was ecstatic!! I screamed and cried and yelled, all that fun stuff. 

Now we plan that *from* the trip I can come by train back home and enjoy the wedding. Now here's where it gets tricky. The french program is intensive, there is class M-F July 1st -August 1st and you can only miss two days without being kicked out, but there are no classes on the weekends. My grandmothers wedding is on a weekend so I will be missing the surrounding Friday and Monday because it is 8 hours on train there and back and that costs $265!?!?! My Grandmother told me I could pick my own MOH dress (Awesome!). She didn't like any of the more cost effective options I pointed out so she ended up buying a dress back home and she's bringing it to Canada. I see that she wanted to surprise me by telling me when it was closer to the date, but she knows I'm super busy with all my courses in my last year, and struggling because I have to pay for it all alone. I understand that it is her special day and she should have everything for it. However, I feel like I'm making quite a few sacrifices, when she hasn't really considered the financial toll this would take on me. WIBTA if I asked her to pay for it?"

I was going to the market a few days ago when i parked normally in a space on a lot close to the entrance, but separated from the market complex. This lot was a classic square lot with 1 entrance, surrounded by grass on all sides and you park on either side.

This lot being close to the market is always full and to get a space is quite rare. What people do is park in the middle of the lot and block those who park in the spaces. This is what happened to me.

I drive an old beat up Renault Megane mk.1 that does not have the best turning circle. So I was unable to get out. I waited for the driver of the posh Mercedes that blocked me.in and started to argue with him how he has the right to just park wherever and block others in. His response was that if i can't get out of the space its my own fault, even though we have a law that forbids and punishes those who do this. This made my blood boil and i responded by saying that the next time this happens i will just call a tow truck and get his car removed. He responds with the standard ill sue you and take your car.

I believe my father is racist and my mother tries to cover it up. He has used the n-word with hard r’s many times in the past, in anger, and wears t-shirts with threats written in Arabic on them. He claims the t-shirts are directed towards terrorists and not all Muslims but i don’t believe it. Mind you, I’m mixed asian-Hispanic so the racism is always directed towards black people and Muslims (and occasionally Puerto Ricans). When he uses these horrible words and I get upset, he will yell at me. He has also told me “people like me (‘the left’) are tearing apart the country,” while in a rage. To be fair, I may talk about politics and what I think, but I don’t want to have to be quiet about it in my own house. My mother has lied to me about what I supposedly heard when I believe my father said the n-word, and heard her whisper to my father about it afterwards, showing it was a lie.

The worst instance was where I went to leave the room bc he said Representative Ilhan Omar should be shot, because I didn’t want to start a fight. He made me stay and screamed at me. My mother did nothing, and tried to make it seem as though my exit was dramatic, which it may have been a little bit, but I chalk it down to thinking my father was provoking a fight with me, which he may have been.

Additionally, when I was a chubby kid, like 11-13, my mother told me I would never be thin (basically, always overweight). That idea festered and made me stop eating lunches throughout middle school. 

I think my parents work hard to give us material wealth because they grew up without financial support, and that may have influenced their treatment of me (my mother was beaten with a belt and my fathers mother burned him with incense) so they mostly focus on making sure I’m never hit or mistreated, but I think they sometimes neglect the emotional aspect because I’m smart for my age. With race and politics they treat me like an adult and will yell at me and say things like “people like you” when we are family and we live together. So, there is a divide between us.

Now, very often, I will randomly cut them out of my life for a day or two because these memories make me so angry, that I still get upset, and then I have to blame it on me feeling bad. Am I wrong for being cold and angry sporadically? Like every other few days I’ll be really mad and not look at them for a few hours, and when I express my feelings to my mother, she says that I shouldn’t care because my father works hard to give us the life we have (upper middle class), which is true. I still get mad very often, but considering the reasons and the other factors, I want to know, am I the asshole?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c4018v	2019-06-23 06:12:55	bubblebot624	AITA For telling the Special education department to change how they line up a student for daily high fives?	"     Alright a little context because I cant really come up with a good title. I'm currently a highschool student and at my school theres one small hallway (maybe 5 to 6 feet wide and 50 feet long). And in this hallway is the special education classroom, during our passing periods the special ed students stand on the side of the hallway to dole out highfives.


     I have no issues with highfiving them, in fact I along with most other students enjoy doing it because it obviously makes them very happy. The hallway is smaller than most other hallways at the school (usually closer to 8 or 10 feet) so them being on the walls makes it a bit cramped but not really an issue.


     Now what happens recently is we received a student who goes to the special ed class, and is in a wheelchair. Obviously a wheelchair takes up more space than just a person standing in the hallway. I've noticed that when he's in the hallway It creates a sort of traffic jam. Students cant slip by each other so it becomes sort of a one way hallway and makes it difficult for lots of students to get to class on time. 


     I decided to bring it up to the teachers of the special education students and reccomend that if they're going to let him go out and get high fives maybe send him to the end of the hall where it widens out or just maybe set him more in the doorway than out in the hall. They thanked me for pointing out the problem and said they'd consider moving him to a more desirable location.


     But recently some of my friends and classmates have been saying it was wrong for me to say he should be moved because he might feel isolated or like a nuisance if they move him. I still feel like it's better now that foot traffic can get through and he still gets his high fives, but some people are saying it was fucked up to ask, so AITA?


     EDIT- I did talk to the student about the issue and he seemed fine with the idea as long as he was able to get his highfives, and not just be removed from the hallway."	Not the A-hole	0	0	6.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c400rx	2019-06-23 06:11:17	dontlookmeupplease	AITA for talking and casually playing tennis while people were waiting?	"The other day I was playing tennis with a friend who I hadn't seen in a while at a public court at a park. Now there were 8 courts available and by the time we got there and got our court, there were 4 other people waiting to play. My friend and I played pretty intensely for about 20 minutes and then took a water break. Upon resuming, we started to just lightly volley and kinda just started chatting. Now, mind you, we weren't yelling or talking really loud, but the court next to us could hear us yammering.

At one point, one of the guys in the court across yells at us ""Hey, people are waiting, if you want to talk, go to a fucking bar or something!"" I yelled back, ""Do you have a problem? We're playing!"" and he yells back ""No! You're not! YOU'RE FUCKING JUST TALKING! THERE ARE PEOPLE WAITING! GO FUCKING TALK SOMEWHERE ELSE!""

Now, I will admit if we were completely just fucking around, he might be valid, but we really were playing tennis and just happened to play a bit more leisurely at this point. I understand where he's coming from, but damn I thought I wasn't wrong here because I figured it was a public court and there's no rule of no talking/no playing leisurely (it's a public park?!). It's one thing if we had already been playing for over an hour (generally speaking, when people are waiting on public courts, you should play for about an hour and then let someone else have a turn), but this wasn't the case. I don't know. I thought the guy was a freaking dick, but maybe I was the asshole all along and he's right?

For those who don't know much about tennis, this is what we were doing (volleying):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhViq28imAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhViq28imAg)"	Not the A-hole	0	0	258.0	57.0	0.0	0.0

c4008u	2019-06-23 06:09:28	kago44	AITA for returning the cat I agreed to adopt to its owners?	"This is my first time posting here, so if I made any mistakes, I’m sorry. I'm on mobile, so I apologize for formatting. 

Me
Owner - X
Owner’s bf - Y
Cat - C

The other day, I was in contact with X about C who needs a new home. I asked about C's personality and X said C is sweet, cuddly and overall a very loving cat. I made my first mistake of agreeing to adopt C without prior visitation. C was loudly growling and hissing as I take C to a safe room. That’s understandable, C is scared, being in a new environment and all. I gave C some space to calm down. However, C kept up with the hissing and growling despite my efforts, so I left C alone for the night. When I checked on C later, I noticed that C hasn’t used the litter box (with the litter X gave me) but instead pooped all over inside my carrier and on the floor and carpet. At this point, I thought C is more like a feral cat

At noon, I went to the kitchen to check on my food, and I didn’t know C was under the table. I guess C snuck out and was trying to explore the house. When I was going to my food, C lunged at me and tried to bite me, while loudly hissing and snarling at me. At this point I was like nope I’m out, I can’t put my other housemates (who left for the weekend, fortunately) in danger from C. I contacted X saying this is nothing like what X has told me. I know it takes time for animals to warm up, but refusing to use the litter box and straight up attacking me aren’t typical domestic cat behavior

At this point I’m panicking, and called my friends, who came over and helped get C into the carrier. My friends tried looking for a shelter that’s open nearby, but there weren’t any as it’s getting late. Then I showed my friends parts of my conversation with X, and they told me the cat in the photo X sent me isn’t C. I’m close to being legally blind, so I cannot see the difference. 

My friends then told me that I cannot keep C trapped inside the carrier all night and wait til morning when the shelter is open, so they advised me to give C back to X and Y, and tell them to give C to a local no kill shelter. I was so exhausted I just went along with that. As X put the carrier in the car trunk, my friends and I made some polite comments about how C looks different from the photo and how such drastic changes can’t happen overnight. They left, but later texted me saying I’m TA, because C was perfectly fine when staying with them and only became aggressive at my house, so that means I’m the problem, not them. They said they had to put C down. They told me that we were disrespectful by doubting if C is the cat in the photo

I feel bad about everything that happened. I felt like maybe I did something wrong while trying to get C to adjust, because if what they said are true, then I am the problem.

c3zw9d	2019-06-23 05:55:48	ClickThePlayTabUpTop	AITA for accidentally getting a 17 on my girlfriend's assignment, but getting A's on all others?	"Hard to sum up in the title.

She's in Europe for the summer and is taking an online Calculus III class. I help her out from time to time when stuff is due and get some of the assignments done.

This week she's been working or drinking every night and didn't get anything done. Her assignment was due tonight at midnight, which is 8:00 AM for her. On thursday she told me she was going out and drinking and I asked her about the math and she said it was fine, she'd get it done. I told her she should really stay in but she sent me a video and she was already out.

Then on Friday she went drinking again. I was really more adamant, this class is important and she's gonna be upset if she has to do all of it on Saturday and miss the whole day. 

Then I wake up Saturday (late afternoon to her) to a drunk call from her. She's out at the beach. Drunk. About 24 hours until the 4 assignments and quiz are due. And from the sounds of it she's gonna be drunk for the rest of the day, then need some good sleep. I'm worried about her. Then, on her way back, she says 'Can I ask you something really shitty?' and I say what and she says ""can you do my math..."" 

I'm annoyed but whatever, she fucked up. She called and said she'd give me a billion dollars when she was back and she owed me a billion and I was like yeah okay I'll get to work on this. So this is at like 3:00 for me. I spend the next 8 hours working hard on this math, basically nonstop except to go to the bathroom or eat. I'm at about 85% on each assignment when she wakes up.

So here's the thing - everything's due at midnight, right? But the quizzes give you a 2 hour limit. So my logic is, you start the test at 11:30PM, you have until 1:30AM even though that's past the due date. So I haven't done the quiz at all. 

She wakes up and says she'll help me finish off the assignments. It's around 11:40 now and we have them all up to 90-95 each. Then I say she should start the quiz now, I'll be on the call to help her.

Turns out I was wrong, you only have until midnight for the quiz. So we panic and she got a 16 on it. The professor drops the lowest quiz in the class.

Also, I'm telling her to email her professor and ask for an extension (because what's the harm in asking, all he can say is no) and she's refusing.

Anyways, she's mad at me. Like really mad. She says she's grateful to me for doing what I did but she's pissed that I fucked the grade up. Am I the asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	65.0	22.0	0.0	0.0

c3ztcn	2019-06-23 05:45:40	travel-aita	AITA for not wanting to go traveling?	"   The family is planning summer vacation spots, and my mom has named three locations: A, B, C. Since I don't like traveling, I tell my mother that I'm fine with C (it's the biggest trip, whole family is on board with it), but that I don't want to go to A or B. She's free to go with whichever other family members want to go though. 

&#x200B;

  My mom gets pretty annoyed, and I start explaining my rationale. I don't like traveling, I don't think looking at scenery and taking pictures is fun, I definitely dislike all the preparing and route-planning, and I'd rather stay at or near home since I can enjoy TV or gaming without the stress and time committment of traveling. 

&#x200B;

  She gets mad at this point and says I'm too close-minded and that it's fundamental for humans to develop an appreciation for traveling, and that other people will think I'm weird for not following this. I reply by saying I'm not going to let others' opinions shape what's fun for me or not. But I sort of concede, and say I'm fine with both locations A and C, but B is still a no-go.

&#x200B;

  Now my mom gets really emotional and starts crying. I think she realized that I'm just saying I'll go to A and C because everyone else is going, not that I'll actually enjoy it. She explains that, since we have conflicting views on traveling and on exploring nature and the whole shebang, I'm too different from her and we can't enjoy family bonding activities together (which is why she's crying and angry). At this point, since she's shouting and crying, I try to appease her by saying I'm willing to go to A, B, and C and lie saying that I'll enjoy traveling to those places, but she stays mad and continues calling me out for being ""close-minded"" and ""spoiled.""

&#x200B;

  I felt like the situation was blown way out of proportion. I didn't say this to her, but I believe my mother was immature and unreasonable in essentially asking me to conform to her ideas of fun, and then guilt-tripping me and crying by saying that I'm ruining the family dynamic (I'm not the only one who doesn't want to go to all 3 locations, by the way).

c3zsr2	2019-06-23 05:43:26	AnyoneNeedAHug	AITA for moving my family across the world and telling grandparents that the kids can’t stay with them during our two week trip back?	"Interested in community feedback here. My wife and I recently moved ourselves and 3 awesome kiddos across the world to another country.  My wife’s parents have known about this plan for years, but have been quite vocal about their disagreement. 

My wife’s dad still lives in the same house he was born in (rural Indiana town).  They just don’t know why anyone would want to leave the US. But, grandma and grandpa are great people and we love them deeply and our kids (8, 5, and 3) love them.  

When we lived in Indiana, our kids would stay the night over at grandma and grandpa’s house at least monthly.  There was a time when grandpa started drinking a bit too often. The kids talked about grandpa acting “silly” and his breath smelling. We discussed it together as a family and stopped the sleep overs. After a few weeks of sobriety, we allowed the kids to stay the night again. 

After we moved 8 months ago, grandma and grandpa started drinking more often. Sometimes during FaceTime my wife notices slurred speech and obvious drunk behaviour.  Grandma even says she drinks to cope with her depression. But every time we FaceTime, grandma and grandpa and the kids talk excitedly about staying the night during our two weeks back in the US. 

We are about a month away from our two weeks back, and the drinking seems to be getting worse. We discussed it together and mentioned it to my wife’s parents, but they insist that they’ll stop when we arrive. Additionally, my wife’s brother who has a heavy history of substance abuse, pathological lying, etc JUST informed us that he will be living with grandma and grandpa during the same time that we will be there. 

Grandma joked with my wife that “we can just have a big family sleep over.”  

But we just can’t take that risk.  These are our children.  Their safety is worth any and all hurt feelings. So we told grandma and grandpa that when we arrive, we can discuss it more, but that we aren’t allowing our kids to stay the night at all.  As adults, we choose who will be in our children’s lives and our own. Just because you’re family it doesn’t give you automatic license to our children. 

They were pissed. The same hurtful things about us “stealing” their grandkids from them came up. I feel like it may forever ruin our relationship with them and our kid’s relationship with them.

c3zsh7	2019-06-23 05:42:25		AITA for not wanting to attend the cocktail hour at my own wedding?	"The title sounds odd but let me explain. We're having a post-elopment wedding reception 2.5years after we eloped. We didn't have a lot back then and now that we're stable, we feel like we owe it to the family to do a celebration.

My MIL started inviting a lot of people that I haven't met and frankly, will never see again after the event. We won't have a ceremony, the event itself will start with a cocktail hour and then dinner, like a normal wedding complete with cake, dancing, DJ etc. 

I was planning to use cocktail hour to take pictures and just chill out in the bridal suite. And then be announced in with a fun entrance song when dinner reception starts. I figured at most  traditional weddings, the couple will use this time to take family photos and location photos. They barely mingle with the guests during this time until dinner. So the same could be applied here too.

My MIL insists that we be there 15mins before cocktail hour starts and greet/welcome the guests. And then I have to mingle and talk to each guest for the next hour or so, then be announced in. Idk why I loathe this so much. I know these people come all the out here and that my MIL helped pay for a lot of the things, I should be grateful. Yet, when I think about coming up with ""water cooler topics"" with guests like my in laws' coworkers, or their long time neighbors, I want to curl up and shrink into my shell and stay there forever. I cannot see myself putting on a smile and have a casual conversation with everyone. I can definitely deliver a generic thank you speech addressing the crowd, but talking to individuals that I barely know or care is frustrating to me. Time goes by so much slower, and there is nothing that could save me from a bad conversation. I can foresee some of the old folks pulling up pictures of their lawn mower or something and I wanna die inside pretending to care.

I just want to be clear that I am totally okay chatting with my close friends. And mingling during dinner reception where I make table rounds and say thank you. I am less anxious doing that because I can always say I need to make rounds to exit a convo. Conversations during this time are a quick in and out as opposed to a real chat during cocktail hour.

Idk, it doesn't sound like a big deal when I'm typing this out. But imagining myself stuck talking to people makes me wanna run far away. My husband thinks IATA for having such rude thoughts, and that I should see a therapist. I can agree with the latter. But I still want to avoid talking to people.

A few facts.  
Boyfriend (M) and I just celebrated our 8 year anniversary.
M has one son (B) and he’s 24
I have one daughter and she’s 20. (C)
B has a gf (T) who is 32

B has a really hard time communicating.  He has no desire to clarify, work out anything and is just around an avoider of conflict.  

M is a perfectionist.  T is also a perfectionist.  

I used to have a job that took me out of the country and was intensely stressful.  I also worked at home and yelled on the phone a lot. 



A few months ago (around March) B was bringing T over the house every night.  T is very social and would engage everyone in the house for conversation (both M and I work from home) so it would take us away from our work but was still pleasant.  It got to the point B was expecting that we would feed and entertain T every weeknight.  I mentioned this to M and we both agreed one of use would talk to B as we had no unwind time.  The next night B asked about T coming over again.  I said sure but this feels like it’s all the time and we don’t have the time to feed and entertain your girlfriend every weeknight.  She has a house and you guys probably should hang out there sometimes.  NOW here I was an asshole.  I tend to talk myself into problems because I’m blunt and then I try to over explain my feelings and I always come out feeling like this gets me into trouble.  I kept asking B of what I was saying made sense.  Told him I liked T but I just didn’t want her over every night.  B took it as I never wanted T to come over and told T this and I had no idea. 

A few weeks later B told M that he had told T this whole thing and that I didnt want her at the house and M told B he fucked up and needed to fix that.  (I had no idea for a few weeks as I was out of the country).  M told me when I came home.  I figured B would or had cleared things up.  During this time I started noticing that T would text my boyfriend (M) all the time and the B and T and M had their own group text going all the time.  I would occasionally see something that made me think of T and buy and send it along with B to give to T.  T would always text M telling him thank you for the gifts.  Not thank you to me ... thank you to him.

"Background: Me and some friends of mine are planing and being good youtubers with actual fun video ideas and movies. I'm the one that came up with this idea and even have proof of it in our group chat the day/second I came up with the idea. I'm still friends with them but they think it was a dick move and are trying to move on with the same basic thing but changed up enough.

The video idea: The basic idea was we would have 1 cook and 1 guest on the show. The cook would make anything for the main course, but he side would always be potato related. The guest would be ""interviewed"" and had to eat whatever was cooked. Me, the chef, would be called Chef Potayto

Why I copyrighted it : My friend who went with the idea but changed it up way to much will be called tom. Tom went with it, but he changed it to exotic meats and potato related food. Then he changed it to two guest and he was Chef Meats, the co chef. I was somewhat fine with that, as long as the potatoes were still in.  Other friend, let's call him jack, was fine with it, he was the leader of the YouTube stuff. Jack was even going to be a guest on the show. Then one day tom tried to get ride of the potatoes and make the exotic meats the main thing. They started to say my idea was stupid and potatoes didn't make sense. Read my username and you'll see why I go for potatoes so much, also I'm a quarter Irish. 

How I copyrited it: I descried the video in a paragraph, put a screen shot of the message when I came up with the idea, put the date, and got some signatures on the page as witnesses. Then i put a copyright signature on it.  Finally, I posted it to Facebook, that shows the date I posted it proving it was before the video.

So AITA for not wanting them to go through with my idea and leaving me out of it? Judge me o dear redditers, judge me fairly and swiftly."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c3zqm6	2019-06-23 05:35:56		AITA for dating my friend's ex	"this happened a while ago but I really just want to know...  also, this is kind of a long story...

.

(TL;DR: my friend thinks I’m dating her ex and gets angry. I’m not dating her ex. She starts really bad rumors about me. I start dating her ex). 

.

Okay, so this girl we’ll call May has been my friend since middle school. 

In high school, she would tell me about this crush she had on this boy in one of my classes. I said I didn’t know him, because I honestly wasn’t familiar with his name (let’s call him Dan).

They dated, but then one day she called me up saying that she fell out of love with him and liked another guy.

She ended up dumping Dan, and because I was then closer to him than May, I consoled him. The new guy May liked rejected her advances. 

Later on, May saw me with Dan, cheering him up, holding his hand and smiling (because I still did not equate hand holding to romance. I did it as a gesture of support. May knows I hold hands with people as friends and I did this with her in the past)

She threw a fit and blocked me everywhere. She made a bunch of posts about how I betrayed her.

I was not dating dan, though it is important to note that I did develop a mild crush at the time.

When I found out about her being upset, I asked to talk to her. She told me she didn’t want to talk. I respected her privacy and left her alone. 

I ended up crying to Dan. We sat in a practice room in the orchestra room and I cried my heart out. This really solidified my romantic feelings for him. 

The next day, another friend told me she messaged several group chats saying I was fucking him in the practice room. I tried to talk to her about this, but she made fun of me for asking.

This continued, and rumors escalated. 

It wasn’t until I starting hurting myself and exposed to May that I could not physically have sex because it revolted me as a result of bad experiences associated with it did she stop. She asked me to forgive her and hit me with the whole “at least we all learned something :)” shtick. I forgave her, but regret that I did.

But Dan really helped me through it. We're in a relationship now but I can’t help but feel like it’s tainted by all this drama. An important thing to note tho is that Dan later revealed to me that he's had a crush on me since before he was dating May.

.

So, all that said, am I the asshole? Did I bring this bullying upon myself? I definitely feel a lot of guilt regarding this situation, especially because I did genuinely have a crush on him. The whole ordeal also makes me a little sick to think about; seeing her name anywhere honestly makes me feel so sick and guilty and I just want to know, because not knowing if I was right or wrong just feels so scary to me."

c3zpky	2019-06-23 05:32:22	serendipity127	AITA for mentioning to my aunt that my cousin was left out?	"First time poster here, not using a throwaway because as far as I know, none of my family Reddits... Famous last words, right? Anyhow.

Tonight we had a family gathering to celebrate my cousin's (not the cousin in the title) graduation from college. We'll call him Bob. I live a few hours away from most of my family, so I was excited to be able to go.

My mom and I were the 2nd to arrive after my grandparents, which is typical. My aunt and uncle, parents of Bob, were hosting. At this point it's me and my mom, Aunt and Uncle, Bob and his girlfriend, and his sister.

After a while, another cousin shows up, the brother of the cousin in the title. We'll call the cousin in the title Ben and the Aunt in the title Becky. I'm starting to wonder if Ben is going to show up. He doesn't live at home any more. So I text him asking if he'll be coming, and he says 'coming to what?' So I told him we're have a graduation party for Bob. He says that no one told him, and he's out of town.

I'm rather disappointed, as Ben happens to be one of my favorite cousins. I mention that no one invited Ben, and everyone is surprised. Bob feels bad, but mentions he forgot Ben no longer lives at home.

Sometime later, Aunt Becky and my other uncle arrive. They greet everyone, and I give it a few minutes. I see Aunt Becky standing off to the side by herself, so I go over.

'Hi, Aunt Becky! How're you?'

'Good.'

'Hey, did you know your son didn't know about this party?'

'Well it's not like he was going to come anyways. He's out of town.'

'Oh, yeah, I was just surprised. Figured it'd be nice if he knew.'

'OK.'

'I'm really not trying to call you out, just thought...' I trailed off because it was getting awkward.

'Yeah, sure.'

Awkward silence. I tried to change the conversation. 'Well, he said he's having fun. He bought an *expensive souvenir*'

'Oh, of course he did.'

I'd had about enough... Her attitude kind of caught me off guard. I said I was going to get some ice cream and walked away.

c3zn53	2019-06-23 05:24:03		AITA for wanting my girlfriend to get rid of a cup	"So some context. I (m20) have been dating my girlfriend (f20) for almost a year now, and things are great! We get along wonderfully, we love each other, and I consider this to be the healthiest relationship I have ever been in. Before we started dating though my girlfriend used to be friends with this guy for a very long time. They were very good friends but at some point in their friendship it became romantic. The romance only lasted a month before before it got called off due to something the guy did. Despite this they continued being friends for the next year. For the most part they held true to their friendship only slipping up once or twice (most recent time being one year ago). Since this they have grown apart and are no longer really friends. Her and I have always been very open about our pasts and her relationship with this guy never bothered me before until now. Here's the issue.

So my girlfriend has this cup with a Rick and Morty design displayed on top of her bookshelf. I never paid much mind to it until one day it came out that the cup was a christmas gift from the earlier mentioned guy (post romance). This bothered me and I confronted her on it which led to us arguing.  She insisted that the cup held no sentimental meaning and that it was just a reminder of their friendship. Pretty much I'm uncomfortable that she is displaying the cup this guy gave her on the shelf considering their relationship. I know that during the time they were hooking up she had really strong feelings for this person. I understand they were just friends for a long time but the gift was given to her after they had had feelings for each other. She also doesn't have any mementos from any other past relationships just from this guy. They also aren't even friends anymore. She told me that a reason she was displaying it instead of using it as an actual cup (which I wouldn't find weird) is because the cup ""isn't meant to be used"" due to the design on it. This is absolutely not true and makes me even more suspicious that there's something deeper there. I didn't even mind her having the cup itself, its just the fact that she had it displayed on her shelf as decoration. The argument ended in her telling me she didn't understand why this bothered me but that she'll take down the cup. However, she has still not done this. I don't want to bring it up again and be controlling, but it is bugging me especially after she told me she would stop displaying it.

c3zlia	2019-06-23 05:18:39	throwaway229385	WIBTA If I let go of a friend?	"I'll try to keep this brief, but context is required. I am a very caring person, I have been my whole life, and unsurprisingly as a child this got my heart broke many times by people who I thought were my friend. This led to me being a very guarded and private person. I'm not jaded or cold, as I do my best to be friendly, but I'll never tell a person about myself unless I really trust them. Throught my entire life, I've only ever had 4 people I've considered close enough friends (family excluded) to open up to. I don't make these connections easily or often, so when I do they mean so much to me. I lost one of these 4 friends due to growing apart and it was one of the most devastating moments in my life. Now I fear it's happening again, but the circumstances are even worse.

&#x200B;

This friend I will refer as Dee. We met two years ago and while it started slow, by the end of the first year we had a connection. She's had a rough life and I really admired how strong she seemed. We've had some really deep and serious moments between us and I've told her many times I love her, something I do NOT do lightly. These past few months, however have gotten proceedingly more rocky before taking an abrupt nosedive. She seemed less and less interested in hanging out and keeping in touch. I sent her texts and even a physical letter reminding her I love her and I'm there for her, and she seemed to appreciate them but things kept getting worse. She's struggling with some things I know, including but not limited to depression and relationship & family issues, so I just wrote it off as she's having a bad time and continued to be as present as I could, keeping my shoulder open if she ever wanted it to cry on. 

&#x200B;

Then out of the blue, she posted anti-gay propaganda on her social media page. I was shocked, she knows I'm gay and is close friends with my girlfriend as well. This hurt me pretty bad. If it was just some random crap I saw, sure whatever. But this was from *her.* I asked her about it and she said she was just posting it to show how stupid it was, but she posted it with no caption and her other friends/family were agreeing with it. Even so I believed her and tried to let it go...but then she did it again. No caption, other people agreeing with it. I'm a tough person, but when someone I give that ultimatum of trust to hurts me, it hurts me bad. Add in the fact that she made no attempt to contact me on my birthday and in general seems to have decreased interest in my existance and I'm pretty torn up about it.

&#x200B;

So here's the part where I'm faced with a dihlemma and am not just seeking validation. I know Dee has gone through a lot, and is going through a lot currently. I plan on talking to her seriously when I'm feeling less emotional but in the event it goes south, would I be the asshole if I let go of a friend who I know is suffering and could just going through a rough patch?"

c3zkp8	2019-06-23 05:16:12	woofwithme	AITA to my friend in this situation?	"

Me: married SAHM to 3YO and 8MO. 8MO does not sleep through the night and wakes up multiple times a night. He also wakes up 3YO if they sleep in the same room.
Lives in small apartment (2 bedrooms) 
Family was sick for the last two weeks (symptoms of flu: chills, headaches, coughing, temperature and runny nose), so the lack of sleep and the illnesses had been making me exhausted.

Friend came to sleep on our pull-out couch in the midst of this illness run. She usually stays for 2 nights in our place as she has some work to do in our city. So it’s not the first time nor second she had stayed with us. Before she came, I informed her that we are all sick. When she arrived, my reception was less warm and enthusiastic than my usual, due to all the sickness and lack of sleep. Then I retreat to my room to rest some more. Then I came out to make dinner for everyone, then retreated back to my room soon after. So after another sleepless night, I came out really early at around 7-ish because my kids wake up early to start the day, and because my dining and living area are the same, so I had to go into the room. So she asked me how my night went. Then I told her about how horrible it was and #2 keeps waking up #1. And then I told her we probably can’t accommodate her the next time she’s in our city as #2 needs to be kept in a separate room and we don’t have the space.  So she says she understands and everything goes on. 

Anyway, so after she left, she sent me a long message about how she was “attacked, hurt, and dejected” from my attitude. So I replied her, I told her that I was sick and tired, and in my own home, at that point of exhaustion, i can actually let go and not be the upbeat, happy person people knows me to be. It was nothing against her. Yet after my long message where I explained the circumstances to her, she still sends me a message, asking me to consider her well-being and that she shouldn’t be subjected to my attitude. On my part, I felt that as a good friend, should be more supportive during such a trying time (especially since she should know my personality, and our families have spent pretty extensive time together)?

Once married our friendship kind of fell away, I fell pregnant again, lift got busy and we talked maybe twice a year. A year ago MF husband died suddenly. Was a shock to everyone as these things are. 
SO and I went to pay our respects but couldn't go to the wake as it was held at a over 18 venue and we have 2 kids under 10. 
Tried to call MF over and over but never got a return call. Life went one and it was suddenly a year. 
MF called me and asked if wanted to get together for anniversary of her hubby's death. 
We got together - turns out she now lives 5 minutes ( 10 minutes walking) from our house. 

After that tried contacting again, still no reply until her son needed a job, she wanted us to employee him ( he has no tools, no experience and no licence at 21 years old.) She even came over to play out the ' things have been so hard since hubby died.... No one is helping me, people said they would help but no one cares ect' 

 Our business has slowed and we had to lay people off so said sorry we can't help at the moment but get your son to get his driver's licence at lease and a car and we could use him to do lawns / landscaping ect. 

She left with hugs and promise to go for coffee. I have tried calling her at least once a week for the mo the since this happened and she has ghosted me until yesterday when she sent me a text to see if I could help her do a few things and if hubby could go over and fix some household things she needs fixing. 

This morning she has some book of faces post about how she doesn't have any real friends and she's done so much for people and why do people treat her like crap. 

I have ignored the text, but I want to know AITA for not going to help her while she is still 'mourning'.  In the time since her hubby died she's called me twice, once was for the 1 year anniversary and the second time was a voice mail that she ment to call another person ( we both share the same name)"	Not enough info	0	0	13.0	9.0	0.0	0.0

"i’m 19, i live with my bf (21) and his mom after recently escaping an abusive situation with my own parents. when i lived with them, i had a job, but my mother forced me to quit, as i don’t have a license and she didn’t want to drive me around anymore. even if i did have the license, we didn’t have another car anyway.

i realize it’s childish of me for not wanting a license. i’m terrified of driving and have mild ptsd from a pretty bad crash that happened when i was 5. now i live with my bf, and, again, even with a license there isn’t much i could do without a license. my bf works 8 hours a day, his mom has a part time job. there’s no extra car, and while there IS public transportation, out here in the sticks, it fucking sucks. when i lived with my parents, i called to ask about a bus coming to get me, but they couldn’t with my previous job’s sporadic calendar.

i feel terrible about not being able to help with money. i do what i can around the house. clean, do dishes, cook, whatever. i want to open up art commissions to try and help a little financially. but i still feel like a leech. i don’t want my bf to feel like he’s carrying my weight. we’re talking of moving to the city so i can get a job and bike there but until then i’m just. stuck. am i an asshole for not having a job? is there anything i can do to lighten my weight on my bf’s shoulders?

c3zc0q	2019-06-23 04:48:28	doyourcurtsy	AITA for pulling my son out of daycare after 1 week?	"So, I started back at work from being on maternity leave for 11 months this past Monday. In my small town we have dayhomes and daycare centres. My older sister takes her 4yo to a dayhome, so I wanted to take my son there so the cousinz could be together, and my sister really likes her. 

We did a meet and greet sort of thing a couple weeks before we started him there so we got to know the woman a bit. She revealed to us that she has 20 kids in her dayhome. For context, in our province the maximum amount of kids per unlicensed dayhome is 8 per 1 worker. Lots of them were school age but she still has quite a few under the age of 5, the youngest being 2 (besides my son who is 11 months). This threw up a red flag but we were desperate for someone and we just  took the plunge.

So the first day comes and all is good. I check in on my lunch break to see how he is doing and she says that hes been good. My boyfriend picked him up at the end of the day and he had a dirty, poopy diaper. It was his first day so I didn't address considering it might be a one off sort of thing. 

Everyday of the week he was picked up with a maximum of 3 diaper changes in 8 hours, dirty clothes, despite me putting 3 changes of clothes in his diaper bag. Thursday my boyfriend picked him up with a smelly, wet, shirt covered in puke. 

Now, the opportunity for a new dayhome has arised and we are pouncing on it. The lady is a long time family friend who recently lost her job who lives near us. We are going to pull our son out of his current day home and take him to our family friend. 

My sisters think I am being irrational and disrespectful for taking him out so soon. While I agree i might be over-reacting a bit, I pay a decent chunk for him to be taken care of and 4 out of 5 days we have had issues. The sister that takes her son there said I am making this stuff up and  she is going to tell the daycare worker that I am trashing her name.

She did it to me my entire life after she dropped me off at my  grandparents and never came back for me. 

I wanted to put a stop to it before it went too far with my own daughter, so I sent a message saying that. She told me “whatever my issues are, please work them out soon.” I cried. I told my daughter’s dad  and he went off on her for talking to me like that. She hid behind her boyfriend (metaphorically, she’s in Vegas right now, we’re not) and had him text my daughter’s dad. I’m not sure what was said but I know they argued, but she still didn’t face any responsibility for what she’s done. 

My brother texted me at work today (after weeks of no contact, as I told him to never speak to me again for telling people my house was such a mess CPS would take my daughter if they found out) saying “you better watch your back, I made a friend in a very special place.” I’m assuming my mom told him what was going on and that’s why he contacted me. I didn’t engage and blocked his number. I’m pissed he would threaten me because my daughter’s dad and I took him in when he had nowhere and got him his current job.

Me and my ex are splitting, finding new places as of 7/1. We both have lots of respect for each other. He is an amazing father to our daughter and I give him nothing but props for that.

The sticky shit comes into our income, me (32 F), make a bit more than him (33 M), as such I have had to bare a lot more of the financial burden, despite him reassuring me in the beginning of our relationship that I would never have to carry him.  This became an issue and, as far as I believe, became the thing that ended our relationship. 

Fast forward...we are both mature adults and love our child very much. She is and will alway be the most important thing to us, so we get along fairly well. His bithday is this weekend. I thought for a send off we would do something for his birthday. 

He picked dinner and a strip club. No problem. We both were not super hungry so we went to a local bar and grabbed a few drinks and an app. I paid for the whole tab. Then went to the strip club, I took out 200 and gave him 60 in cash for singles, I paid for covers and drinks. I also bought him 2 private dances.

I ran out of cash, when I went to the ATM despite having money in my account the ATM said I had ""exceeded my withdraw limit"" so I could not get any more cash. I told him we had a few options. 1) we Uber (we had both been drinking) to the nearest location of my bank and hope the ATM there lets me take out more, or 2) we go home because I was out of cash. He then tells me he has $100 he can spare in his account and to just Venmo me later. 

This kinda triggers me and let me explain why. For my 30th (my last BD) he paid me back for tickets to a concert and called this his present. I honestly don't really like the band, but he does. He begged me to buy tickets to this show for weeks and just because it was close to my birthday he presented it as his birthday present to me. Honestly I felt cheated of my 30th. So I paid 100% for a trip to NYC to see a show I actually wanted to see, including food/hotel/ticket for us both. 

I cried most of the Uber home, which I paid for,  I just feel used. He hasn't spoken to me since (just a few hours, but still, idk). 

Was it wrong to get mad that he assumed I would be paying for 100% of his birthday when he didn't really do that for mine? Let me know..."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	37.0	11.0	0.0	0.0
c3z2ym	2019-06-23 04:19:55	ztefa90	AITA for not wanting to talk to my best friend anymore after he played with my sister’s feelings?	"My best friend (J) and I have been best friends for a long time. He’s been like a brother to my sisters and I.
My sister (L) and J have had a very deep connection. J & L had a summer fling about 3 yrs ago, but as soon as J left for college, he ghosted her. When he got back the next summer, my sisters & I decided to just go on with our friendship as if nothing had happened because we valued his friendship. 
Fast forward to the beginning of May, J started flirting with L again and we all thought he and my sister were going to work out this time.
Now here’s where the trouble started. We have a mutual friend (N), who J seemed to also have a crush on. He would consistently bring her up in conversations about how his other friends wanted him to go out with N. And he kept saying that he hadn’t done anything to pursue her because he felt weird about it. But he kept talking to N either ways and we kept asking him “are you pursuing her?” And he would always answer no. 
He always hinted at liking L because of how much they had bonded and had a deep connection. 
Finally, this past Wednesday, L saw J & N really flirting with each other and L went home that night really confused about J. J texted her all night long, but she ignored him. Even after I told him she was asleep, he kept texting her. The next morning, he texted her a couple more times.
L confronted J and told him that she was afraid he would ghost her again and that she had developed feelings for him but wanted to know if he was just playing around with her or if he truly liked her. 
J answered her saying he had no intentions of going after L and that he actually had feelings for N. He admitted he had played around with her feelings and that he only saw them as best friends and nothing else. 
My sister was devastated and I became very angry with J. Not only had he constantly lied to my sister and I about having feelings for N, he manipulated L into thinking he liked her. 
L called J that evening and they both cried on the phone. J kept telling L that he didn’t want to lose her friendship, that she was his best friend, that he was actually confused about his feelings and liked L but was too afraid to admit it. Basically, he changed his story because he realized he was losing L. 
It bothers me that, even when my sister confronted him, he lied to her yet again. He admitted into having played with her and was going to do it for a few more weeks or months. Plus, this is the second time he plays with my sisters emotions. He’s admitted in the past to having flirted with and ghosted a few other girls, but we just always thought he had commitment issues. He has also admitted manipulating people and even “joked” around saying he also manipulated L. Once again, because he was so close to us, we didn’t think anything of it. 
L wants me to talk to him to fix things between us because she already forgave him but I still want nothing to do with him. I can’t trust someone who constantly lied and manipulated."	Not the A-hole	0	0	45.0	23.0	0.0	0.0
c3z21f	2019-06-23 04:17:14		AITA: Ending a friendship over bad dog sitting experience	"Posting from my husband’s account.
My husband quickly became good friends with a coworker at his first duty station, the two often hang out together and help one another. The most recent task has been dog sitting. The friend, we will call him K, asked my husband to watch his husky for 5 days. He assured my husband the dog was housebroken. The night the dog was dropped off out our house, he shit upstairs, assumed it was an isolated incident. 
The next morning I wake up to find several poop piles and pee stains. I text owner and ask “what type of discipline for isolated potty Incidents” to which he replies “it’s our fault, he started pooping and peeing again we neutered him”. 
The dog has been constantly pooping and peeing in the house after being taken outside, biting myself and my husband, and terrorizing our lab.
I have made it very clear to my husband that I feel taken advantage of and no longer want a friendship with owners. 
Does that make me an asshole?"	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c3z0eq	2019-06-23 04:12:15	OhSuketora	WIBTA if I ask to skip family dinner today	"Dad is in another country because of work so for the past two years it's been my mom and us three daughters. Two of us live at home but the youngest (15) is in a boarding school 40 min away but comes home on weekends. She often opts to stay over the weekend in the dorms however, both to study and because her friends are staying too. I was in the same dorm for senior high so I understand why she does it as I've done so before too.

We still have dinner together so we can all see each other for the weekend, and this normally takes up half the evening. This weekend she's staying in school again so out we go for dinner. Yesterday my friends were livestreaming a movie and I declined because of family mealtime, but as a result I was sneaking glances at the chatroom throughout dinner. I'd put down the phone, go back to eating silently while my mom and second sister discuss her plans for next month when she starts at a new university, then my phone vibrates and I pick it up again. This made my mom upset and she calls me rude and ""cruel"" for ""torturing"" my family by not giving them my undivided attention during meals. I affirm what she says by repeating that yes I am indeed ""cruel"" and this is where youngest sis raises her voice and says if I don't care about mealtime together so much not to come eat with her next time and that I'm ""always spoiling things"". I point out I'm the one who normally enters the dorms to sign her out for going out to eat as her guardian because mom is driving and 2nd sis can't be bothered, and she says they could do it if I'm not there anyway.

2nd sis is on her phone throughout this exchange, once she saw her convo with mom was interrupted. 

Now my mom has a temperament where she says extremely harsh things she doesn't actually mean while upset, and my youngest sis takes after her. They're quick to anger and quick to recover too, and once I put the phone away we start a new convo where everyone is laughing and enjoying ourselves. So I don't actually want to stop coming to family dinners just because of what was said, and I'm used to this sort of thing so I don't hold it against them. We made plans to meet up today to eat too. 

But just now my friend group decided to have another live stream which I hope to catch this time, but it starts while we would be still outside at dinner. I was thinking I could ask mom whether I stay at home and they get takeout for me so I don't miss the stream, but I'm not sure whether it's appropriate given what happened yesterday. I've missed meals like this before because I needed to study for exams, and 2nd sis has done the same when she's out with friends for the weekend, but this will be the first time I ask to stay home because of non academic reasons. Also there's what transpired yesterday, so I'm not sure whether I'll be the asshole if I ask to not go. 

Stream starts in 6 hours, we leave for dinner at 5."	No A-holes here	0	0	803.0	46.0	0.0	0.0
c3z04w	2019-06-23 04:11:25	High8899	AITA for thinking my my friend is an asshole?	"Basically my friend and I were discussing going to a concert together, and eventually we both agreed that we would go. We made a deal that I would pay for both our tickets, (pretty inexpensive), if exchange for a ride to and from the concert. I thought it was a pretty good deal and was excited for the concert. 

About a week after I purchase 2 tickets, one of our mutual friends tells me that my friend, who we'll call Joe, isn't even sure if he can go to the concert for work related reasons. 

Normally I wouldn't care if he had work, but I'm angry at Joe since I bought his ticket already. Just because of past experiences with Joe, odds are that he would have backed out of our deal sooner or later so I made the same deal with another friend. Hopefully things work well with him too.

c3yysv	2019-06-23 04:07:20	Hey_Zeus_Of_Nazareth	WIBTA for not going to my sister's baby shower?	"I have multiple siblings. All but the sister in question have more than one kid. She has a toddler and is pregnant with her second. 

Our relationship isn't great. Our personalities clash, and the way she interacts with me often seems standoffish/fake. 

She also puts on a front so that others (myself included) will view her as the caring older sister that she really isn't.

A few years ago I got engaged. At the time, she and her partner had just had their first baby. She wanted to get married, but he was against it (for BS reasons). She didn't react well to my engagement news.

Despite our shaky past, we often talk about things I wouldn't discuss with my older siblings (sex, drugs, etc) because we're closest in age.

So, when my fiance became abusive, I reached out to her for support. 

She needlessly complicated the situation in ways I can't go into due to character limits. I don't think her actions were the result of love or concern, though I'm sure that's what she told herself.

I dodged a major bullet, but it was still painful to watch the life I built with my ex crash and burn.

Two days after I left him, my sister sought me out to tell me she'd just gotten engaged.  

I understand being excited, but the timing/way she said it felt like she was rubbing it in my face. She definitely could've waited a while, to be more sensitive of my situation.

This happened a few months ago. I'm still hurt, but talking to her about it wouldn't change anything, and I'd rather focus on my own healing.

I'm now the only childless, single sibling, which makes it hard to relate to the others. I've tried, but it feels like I'm forcing it. I explained this to my other siblings, said that I love them, but I'm at a new stage in life, and it often feels overwhelming being around them. They were very understanding.    

Recently, my sister told me she was pregnant. I congratulated her, and meant it. 

However, I do not want to attend her baby shower.

My sister is the ""favorite"" and still gets preferential treatment, even as an adult. My other siblings have acknowledged and often seem exasperated by this. None of them had a 2nd baby shower. They told me it was common etiquette to only have one for your first. I'm sure there are exceptions, and honestly, it's not my business. But here they are, throwing her another baby shower. I feel they're indulging her, and I want no part of it. 

Today, they asked if I was coming. Normally I would suck it up and go. I love my family and don't want to cause tension. But given her actions during and after I left my ex, combined with the fact that I think this is just placating her self centered desires, I don't want to attend. 

Despite all this, my family is tightknit. I know they want to celebrate the new baby. They know how I feel about my sister at the moment. If I make an excuse, they'll see through it. I'm positive they'd think I'm being an asshole.

No advice needed. My mind is made up. But, given all this, would I be the asshole for skipping her shower?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	13.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

I literally just wanted to change the station and his computer is a touchpad so I had some trouble using the touchpad and I guess it freaked him out? I have no idea what he’d be so worried about. 

He watches a fuck ton of anime as a 35 year old and said he’s wanna go to Japan and go to a maid cafe where the women act like servants. 

He also is constantly on his phone even though I see him once a week and I told him I am going to be out of town next week so he won’t get to see me for like two weeks.

c3yxdt	2019-06-23 04:03:07		AITA for not wanting a vacation?	"-Throwaway because I don't want this attached to my main account.-

My wife wants to go visit her family, who lives 6 hours away, but she also wants a beach trip. I'm in a situation where I'm unable to take any days off from work for another month. We are also just a month and a half removed from having a 10 day visit with her entire family.

I work a second shift job (2-10pm) with Tuesday-Wednesday offdays. My wife (stay-at-home mom (YES, I know this is very difficult work!)) is suggesting that we leave as soon as I get off on Monday at 10pm for a beach that her family is staying at 8 and a half hours away, with a 4 month old breastfeeding infant in the car as well. I have to be back at work Thursday by 2:00pm.

My points against it:

1. We have two dogs that are unable to accompany us. The only way is to convince a friend to stay at our place while we're gone so he can watch them.

2. I'm going to be exhausted, and we'll be driving through the night after a work day.

3. We won't have enough time at the beach at all. By the time we get there (probably around 7-8am after time change), we'll have to sleep. When we wake up around 2-3pm, we only get a couple hours at the beach until it's dark. On Wednesday, we'll have most of the day but have to get ready to leave and by home by 3-4am so I can sleep and wake up in time for work.

Her points:

1. She doesn't get to see her family often, and has been wanting a vacation. This knocks out two birds with one stone.

2. We will still get time at the beach, even if it's not for a full day.

3. We can split up the driving and we don't have to be home on Wednesday until early morning, so we can still enjoy our time.

I have suggested waiting for another month and actually taking some real time off to go spend with her family, and we also have plenty of hours eligible to take later in the year for a vacation for just us.

She hasn't called me an asshole by any means, but is a bit upset that I'm not entertaining the idea and has mentioned possibly going by herself (leaving at 4am), which I'm apprehensive about because of her traveling such a long distance alone with a baby but won't stop her from doing.

Today i asked her if i can meet up with him a few nights later for dinner because:
1. He's only in the country for 2 days he literally doesn't have another time (because of graduation)
2. We are CLOSE friends (he has a girlfriend, I bave a boyfriend and we're loyal)
3. We're literally nevet gonna see each othet after this and graduation because he's leaving the country

When I as her why she would not let me meet up with him (just me and him only) she said that:
1. He's a male
2. It's not right for a male to go out with a female alone
3. On the day when i meet up with him, we plan to go to a restuarant near his hotel because he's going to drop his luggage off at the hotel then meet up with me. My mum said that its wrong for a girl to go out of her way just to fit a guy's arrangement (i live 45 minutes away from said location)
4. Going out at 7pm is late and dangerous, especially if its just me and him.
