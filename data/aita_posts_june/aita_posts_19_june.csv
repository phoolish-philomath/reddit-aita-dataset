c2r7ef	2019-06-20 03:59:56		AITA for simply wishing to keep to myself	"Let me start off by saying that I'm the kind of guy that usually likes to keep to himself. At first I always used to like being at the centre of attention, but as time passed on, I started to keep more to myself more often. 

The truth is, I've never really been fond of keeping too much of company. When I was younger, I always felt that I should've done stuff to join the popular crowd, but the more I did it, the more I was ridiculed. 

I soon realised that I've usually enjoyed keeping to myself, preferring to enjoy the company of a few people, and this of course is such a big fucking deal to many people. 

I was also dealing with depression and anxiety a lot back then, which of course alienated me away from several people because ""we're not trained professionals, stop leaning on us"". I kept more to myself, and of course many people complained about me preferring to spend most of my time in my room than anywhere else. Truth is, I don't like to go out too much, so what's the big fucking deal. 

I enjoy a plethora of activities like learning languages, learning new things, which are hobbies that not many people around me seem to have. 

So I'm confronted for all of this by an acquaintance. He tells me that I'm ""boring"", ""uninteresting"", to which I then tell him ""you don't know me too well, you don't know what I'm going through, so who the hell are you to judge me for doing what I do?"" He then tells me ""You got to explore the world. You can't hole yourself up like this"". 

And I tell him ""Okay, then care to explain what I'm about to share with you? You always claim you're busy, yet when I message you, you ignore my messages. Your other buddy decides to ridicule me in front of several other people for not being open and when I confront him, he tells me that he had to do it because he's sick and tired of trying to get me to open up to others."" 

He is dazed, and before he says anything, I tell him ""Perhaps if you all could giving me shit about this, maybe things can go a long way. I don't get why it's such a big deal to you.""

Am I an asshole for simply wishing to keep to myself?"		1	0
c2r7d4	2019-06-20 03:59:49		AITA for asking what my girlfriends post school plans are?	Okay, some background. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years now. We started dating our senior year in highschool. Both of us like to live life with the finer things (nice clothes, doing fun stuff on the weekends, buying toys, etc) now we both have been pretty spoon fed through our highschool years. Fast forward to present day, I am a machinist at a pretty large company, with pretty good pay and benefits. As a 20 year old male with just a certificate from my vocational school at my highschool I am making almost 45k a year. My girlfriend is going to school to be a medical assistant. Which is great for her, she is excited to get into her field, and feel like she is making a difference. The only part that worries me is what she will be making for money long term. I did some research and the high end of the pay scale is about 6k less than what I am making now. So I thought it would be the right thing to do to ask her what her plans were after she got her degree. The convo went something like this. I asked her if she planned on continuing her education later on in life by going back to school to be a registered nurse. Well lets just say things took a turn for the worst. She immediately said “idk, dump me if my degree isn’t enough to support your toys.” I went on to say that it wasn’t meant to sound like I was cutting her down by what she wanted to do. She thinks that she isn’t smart enough to be a nurse and will not make it to be one. I told her that she is the only one stopping her from doing that. I also mentioned that I just wanted us to have a good life when we are older and don’t want to ever see us have to struggle and worry about money, it was never about making her feel like she needs to make more money.

c2r71t	2019-06-20 03:58:49	fromthepagesofbooks	AITA for snoring?	"So I had a friend that goes on a paid trip each year (January) as part of her scholarship and she takes someone with her. She asked me to go in November and I agreed.
Then I got into a car accident in December. I was bruised and sore beyond belief but my plane ticket was nonrefundable so I pushed through and decided to still go. Unfortunately, my body does not handle stress. I was slightly sick, just a cough and congestion. 
The flights go off without a hitch and we arrive and stop at a few places she wants to see and head to the hotel and eat. I’m still sick so I shower and knock out, only to wake up to my friend telling me to stop snoring. I’m tired and out of it but I know the event she needs to go to is important so I take some night meds for congestion and pass back out. 
For two hours. The meds didn’t work. 
I hope in the bathroom and let the shower fill it with steam and back to bed. 
Two hours. 
It is about 4 am at this point and she’s asking me if I can go to Walmart and buy nose strips because she can’t sleep with my snoring. The closest Walmart is 20 minutes away and I’d have to take a Lyft. I tell her I’ll stop at the CVS in the morning and stay up the rest of the night and go first thing to buy the strips and pass back out since she’s gone.
She later asks me to just stay awake or out of the room entirely until 1. Not happy but whatever I want to support my friend. I spend the whole day out and have a really fun time. 
When night time came I found a restaurant and the bartender kept me company and told me what bar to go to when the restaurant closed. I hop over there and order one drink and I want to point out, I don’t like drinking in public. I’m a short feminine looking person, I don’t need to go into why I was uncomfortable. This was my third drink and I was starting to feel tipsy but it was barely 12 so even if I wanted to go to the hotel I’d have to sit in silence so I stayed and chugged about two glasses of water. Walking back to the hotel a man followed me for two blocks and tried to talk with me. So anxiety has now doubled. 
It’s finally 1am. I go up and quietly get my stuff to shower and play music quietly on my phone to calm down, which apparently wasn’t quiet for my friend. Okay whatever shower done and I hop into bed. A nose strip on, a pillow nest making sure it is impossible for me to turn onto my sides. 
One hour. 
She sits up and tells me she can’t sleep while I sleep and asks me to stay up until she leaves, around 9am, and then just sleep the rest of the day. I wait as long as I can but I still pass out. I woke up to several texts saying she needed me to stay out even longer this night, despite me telling her I was uncomfortable doing so. She even sends me messages in a group chat with a mutual friend. When she leaves I break down and leave and pay for a hotel closer to the airport.
Edit: I know how much she needed sleep and I wanted to help as much as possible"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2r6vu	2019-06-20 03:58:17		AITA for going out to the shops at night.	For context I am European staying with my boyfriend (SO) in the USA. I am 40 and he is 45. I have lived in a couple of  major world cities and his current town that has little to no crime. Most nights we drink some beer and / or wine. Most days I do fuck all except housework and a walk around the neighbourhood to keep fit and keep in touch with my family.  He gets up early and so he needs to sleep early. I have occasionally taken an Uber to either get some more cigarettes or wine at around midnight ( largely out of boredom). He gets mad at me for doing this but I see nothing wrong with it as long as I don't put myself in harm's way.  It's led to explosive arguments. I currently feel like a caged horse. His concerns are that something will happen to me even though nothing has or will.AITA for going out late at night even though I am safe?		1	0

c2r65i	2019-06-20 03:56:10		AITA for having breakfast with a female co-worker after my wife was shitty about it before?	"Lots of backstory here, but somewhat simple. So I work a night shift management job that sees me working multiple 14-15 hour shifts in a row, followed by a few days off. I work with 5-6 other managers that each have their own teams of 40-50 people and all the bullshit that goes along with working middle management.  For a long while, most of us would leave work on our last day and head out to whatever breakfast dive we decided on but due to some changes in both workload and group dynamic, this doesn't happen often anymore. However, a female co-worker/friend (who has been friends with my wife for many years longer than I've known her) and I both enjoy winding down the long work week over greasy bacon and other breakfast delights.  

So on two occasions over the last two years others from our group have bailed, leaving just the two of us. I have told my wife both times and it wasn't a big deal until she once flipped her shit over something else that it came up. Well, being that she said such things whilst in the midst of a barrage of fury, I placed it in the bucket of ""shit she says when she's mad but doesn't mean other than to be hurtful"". Fast forward to the other day, it's breakfast with only myself and this same female. Afterwards I come home and don't hide the fact it was just her and I there. I wake up two days later to my wife screaming and yelling about what a piece of shit I am and how I don't care for our relationship, etc. Etc. She's been saying all day that I'll have plenty of time soon to do whatever I want and being hateful every chance she gets. To further complicate things, do have a child that's at a critical influential age. 

For the record, I have zero interest in this other woman beyond a professional and strictly platonic friendship.

c2r5rl	2019-06-20 03:55:00		AITA for wanting to go on a 3 day trip with my SO while my grandmother is visiting for over a month?	My 4 year anniversary with my bf is coming up next week. To celebrate we want take a 3 day trip. My grandmother who lives in italy is coming to visit for over a month a few days before my trip is planned. My grandma and I are not close because she doesn’t speak English and I can’t speak Italian well and also the distance keeps us from having a close relationship. Every time I visit her, we almost never speak. My grandma is not close to any of my siblings either. I want to go celebrate my anniversary by taking a 3 day trip with my SO but my mom wants me to not go anywhere for a month to be with my grandma. I think this is unfair because my grandma will not miss me while I’m on my trip. She doesn’t even try to talk to me ever so I’m sure my absence for 3 days will make no difference to her whatsoever. My mom thinks I’m being an asshole and in her words a crazy bitch for even thinking of leaving while my grandma is here. AMITA?		1	0

So im a junior in highschool right now, and so is my friend, lets call him jan. Jan and i used to get similar grades but now, during the end of the year i have improved, and he has declined.

The thing is i have never really studied, i know it sounds like a shitty brag, but i have never spent hours upon hours studying. I usually look over the notes 30 minutes the night prior and i have consistently got As and Bs throughout highschool. My friend Jan studies far more, he spends hours a night, weeks in advance of a test studying. 

Despite the difference in ability, we have always got similar grades. But towards exam week he has dropped mostly to low Cs in almost all classes. 

We were recently driving to a party and he asked me how my grades were and i told the truth. I said ""solid, all As accept for 2 bs in Chem 12 and History 12, havent been studying but im doing well, its sick not having to spend hours working to do well"" and he said im an asshole for bragging about it.

c2r52m	2019-06-20 03:53:02		WIBTA if at my work meeting I point out the fact that none of them went to college and are stuck working at a fast food restaurant for the rest of their lives?	"Okay background. I (20F) am a shift lead at a popular fast food restaurant. Where I work there is a general manager, an assistant manager,  and 4 shift leads (including me). 

I am currently in college taking 16 credit hours per semester and 12 credit hours during summer, and working full time. I also have a part time job occasionally on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights,  and I'm in concert and pep band at school. I currently only open (6am-2pm shifts), and this is where the conflict starts.

My job is open from 7am to 2am, meaning we get there at 6am and leave around 3-4am. I only work until 3pm on occasion, and one shift lead (28) and the assistant (45) thinks it's unfair and ultimately hate me for not closing. The assistant even told a night crew worker ""I fucking hate that bitch."" My gm is perfectly okay with my schedule, and encourages my education and always asks if I need an extra day off to relax or have ~some~ free time. The assistant has told me multiple times to drop out.

There are some days the closes are complete shit, like they didn't clean any tables, they didnt take any trash out, or they didn't sweep/mop the floor, and I always point it out. Like why is it fair for me to do their work and all my morning tasks? They claim I'm being dramatic and exaggerating things, so I started taking pictures and showing my gm. The gm has told them to stop purposely leaving the store like that for me, and that just pissed them off more. 

Today I worked with the one shift lead that hates me, and I mentioned how their close wasn't good and they didn't even attempt to clean the lobby. They blew up and said ""well maybe if you closed you could clean the lobby"" and stormed off. I really wanted to say back ""yeah I would be petty about me not closing too if I knew I was stuck here for the rest of my life because I was lazy and didn't go to college"" but my gm was there so I stopped myself. 

We have a work meeting this Sunday. WIBTA if I brought this up? Or mentioned to them that maybe they would view me/the situation differently if they went to school too? Like I'm definitely mentioning it, I just don't know how to go about it with out being a total bitch tbh."		1	0

c2r45z	2019-06-20 03:50:24		AITA for ignoring all of my grandmother’s calls for not making it to my baby shower?	"My dad’s mom and I have never been very close but I’ve been making attempts to make her feel included as I go through large life events in an effort to foster a better relationship. In 2017 I got married and invited her to my bridal shower. It was a small get together with only my closest friends and immediate family.  Less than 10 people were invited in total. She, unfortunately, already had a trip planned. My dad understood how important it was to me to have her go and offered to pay upwards of $500 to help her change her travel plans to make it. She ended up calling me and informing me that she was “unwilling to change her plans.” While really disappointed I understood and didn’t let it impact my efforts.

Last year we welcomed a baby boy into our lives. He is her first great grandchild. I made an effort to call her (she lives across the country) and really include her in the big news. She was ecstatic for us. A few months later we invited her to the baby shower. Again, it was a smaller intimate gathering of only 10 invited people. Upon receiving the invite she informed me she again had travel plans and would not be making it. My dad again attempted to pay for the change for her and she did not want it to impact her trip to Maui. This time, I am less forgiving. 

Now, whenever she calls I completely ignore it. The way I see it, if she’s unwilling to make an effort to come to big life events then I am unwilling to stop what I’m doing to have a conversation with her. Am I the asshole for refusing to answer her calls because she didn’t make time for my life events?"		1	0

c2r2fg	2019-06-20 03:45:26	HKNinja1	WIBTA for posting huge notes everywhere that say WASH YOUR HANDS, for a fully grown adult male?	"I live with my boyfriend and my male best friend of almost 20 years. I am 6 months pregnant with my second child, low immune system and highly susceptible to getting sick. Both men work dirty jobs, boyfriend is an electrician that drives, comes home, first thing he does is wash his hands before anything else. Best friend repairs pallets for a living, doesn’t drive and takes the city bus an hour each way, comes home, goes through the food cupboards, is in the fridge, eats, go to the washroom, and still doesn’t wash his hands. I have had to ask him several times to wash his hands as I have repeatedly found black marks on the light switches, doorframes, and even walls. (The house is only a couple years old and white painted EVERYWHERE.) Much less the fact of simple sanitation. 
Last night he comes home, same story, opens the fridge, grabs his dinner, eats it, goes to the washroom and immediately comes out afterwards without washing. I was upset as I shouldn’t have to continually  ask him to wash his hands when he gets home and after using the washroom. I touch the same surfaces as him, that he touches after being on a bus where hundreds/thousands of other people have touched those same surfaces with their grubby hands. I own my own cleaning business and should not have to carry wipes with me 24/7 in my own home cleaning up after a fully grown man, when my own 7 year old son knows better. 
When confronted last night, he was snarky and said “I don’t always remember, so cut me some slack.” My response was “WTF is wrong with your head? Seriously, how many times do I have to remind you, you can get me very sick!”
Well now it’s escalated and we’re not on talking terms at the moment. WIBTA if I taped up signs on everything that said ‘Wash your hands!’ including his bedroom door as a passive/aggressive act in hopes that he finally gets the hint? What would you do in this situation?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c2qywi	2019-06-20 03:34:46		AITA for encouraging a comedian to roast my ex in front of his new girlfriends parents?​	"SO. 

Everyone in this situation works in the same pub together. Before anyone says 'don’t shit where you eat' — I know this now. 

I dated this guy, let’s call him Adam, for just over six months. He broke up with me via text saying that he can’t see us being together forever. I was really into him and quite sad about it, and we’ve had to continue working together since then. 

Around two months ago it comes out that he has slept with this girl, we’ll call her Jessica, who is one of my close friends at work. I am upset, but mainly because neither Jessica or Adam told me themselves, I found out through someone totally random. We spoke at the time, they both said it was a drunken mistake and they didn’t tell me because it would never happen again. 

Then I got really sick and had to take a month off work, and when I came back there were rumours flying around that they were now dating. I became paranoid because I didn’t have any real idea what was happening, and eventually asked them both if something was going on, and they told me it was. So I had to push them both just for a bit of honesty which, if I had received in the first place, I wouldn’t have been anywhere near as upset. I just felt lied to. 

So fast forward to today. We do live comedy at our bar on a Wednesday night, in a function room, and I was the bartender working that shift tonight. Around an hour before the comedy starts Adam and Jessica walk in with Jessica’s parents, who Adam is meeting for the first time. Into an empty room with just me and the two comedians. They do not acknowledge me at all. They both knew I was working that night and could have gone anywhere else or even just given me a heads up via text. 

So this is the point in the story where I get quite irritated. Not just because of that action, but because of everything leading up to it. I felt disrespected completely. So I approached the first comedian billed for the night and said “ — so you want to hear a funny story?”

I explained everything from beginning to end and she found it outrageous and hilarious. And then she asked me “wait. Can I incorporate this into my set?” 

Long story short, I thought that was a very funny idea and told her she should do it. She called him out for the situation during her set in front of around 50 attendees and laid into him a little bit. It wasn’t completely savage, but it wasn’t nice. And it was in front of this girls parents. The audience loved it, of course, and at the time I found it hilarious. I find out later on that they were both “very, very upset” by what had happened and Jessica cried (a lot) about it. Apparently Jessica’s parents found the whole thing quite funny. Am I the asshole?

TL;DR My ex and his new girlfriend have done a series of asshole things towards me. After the final straw of these asshole movements I encouraged a comedian to roast them as he met her parents for the first time.

Edit: okay, okay noted it was impulsive and wrong. I will be apologising to them both tomorrow at work."	Asshole	0	0

It was my turn to present in my documents to a Border Patrol officer, and I said the usual ""Good morning"" in a pleasant manner. He looked at me, completely unamused.

Somehow, somewhere, this pisses him off, prompting him to say ""Do you know how to say excuse me young man"" and I said ""yes"". And then he said ""Do I look like your friend""? And I said ""no"", which then lead him to say ""Then don't you dare talk to me like that"".

I was a little offended that that's one of the first things he, basically a stranger, asked me. It felt rude to say the least.

c2qvyp	2019-06-20 03:26:18	AITAxThrowawayDad	AITA for not moving closer to my daughter?	"Daughter is 7, and lives with Ex-gf and Step-dad in Virginia. I live in Washington state. Before this, we all lived in Guam. Ex-gf and I separated when Daughter was 2, and we shared joint custody until Daughter was 4 when they moved. EDIT Ex-gf and I are from Guam and had our daughter in Guam. Ex-gf got married to Step-dad, then they moved to Virginia.

&#x200B;

About 3 years ago, Daughter (then 4 years old), Ex-gf, and Step-dad, who is in the military, relocated from Guam. I was informed months ahead of time. I was told they would be moving to Texas, but after they left they instead relocated to Virginia a month or two later because Step-dad got promoted. I was told that they would be moving again in 3 years time. They weren't sure if they would stay or move again after 3 years.

&#x200B;

I moved from Guam to Washington state, not Virginia. I did so because I thought it was the right thing to do, to allow Ex-gf and Step-dad to care for my Daughter when I felt like I would not be able to. I did so to bide 3 years time to wait and see where they would move, and to invest in myself and my career so that when 3 years came, I would be ready.

&#x200B;

To be honest, I wasn't even sure if I had moved to Virginia that I could have even successfully cared for my Daughter financially or emotionally. I did not have a job when I moved, or a car, or any family anywhere in the US that I could rely on. I moved with two suitcases of all my belongings and about a $1,000 to my name. I was also depressed at that time. How could I move there knowing they'd move again in 3 years, especially when I could barely move across the planet to begin with?

&#x200B;

I moved to Washington state because I had a couple friends who could house me while I found a job. I eventually found a job and my own place, and have always sent child support and daycare expenses. Unfortunately, I was late with payments when I couldn't afford it.

&#x200B;

Ex-gf faults me and reminds me often that I chose to miss these 3 years, and I have been late for payments, and I have not been there for her these past few years. I try to stay positive and not speak negatively about Ex-gf, because it is not healthy and I want to have a healthy wholesome relationship with Ex, Step-dad, and Daughter.

&#x200B;

I have visited my Daughter 7 times in these three years, for about 5-7 days each time. Never missed a birthday, and made sure to call her all the time, and write to her and send her gifts. She still calls me Dad. When Daughter and I are together in person, our time is filled with laughter and joy.

&#x200B;

I've missed out on 3 years and I take full responsibility for that.

c2qu8z	2019-06-20 03:21:27		AITA for letting a group of girls push in front of me on the bus?	"It was Avery tiring day for both me and my husband at work.

We were waiting for a bus when suddenly it appears and my husband jumps in and rushed into the bus doors. Unfortunately 3 girls pushed in front of me and I couldn't make it to him in time.

When we were standing on the bus, I was stuck behind him. This upset him and he told me that there's no way I can work in sales if I let people push in front of me. He got mad and told me I need to be more rutheless. He kept raising his voice at me until I broke and cried and begged him to stop yelling a telling me that I'm weak and too nice won't make me stronger. He kept saying things to me in earshot on the bus but when I turned around and said 'I don't care if someone pushed in front of me. I just want to go home' he told me to stop making a scene (and basically stop talking as it's embarrassing him)

He apologized and said that he's saying it to me because he cares about me and just wants me to succeed. 

Ok can I honestly say, I know I'm NTA in this situation but I wanted to ask, would you classify this behaviour as abuse? I'm not sure what a long term marriage is like, but these signs always make me feel like I'm being disrespected. My husband always criticizes me on small things till I break and cry and I've had to ask him all the time to give me words of encouragement instead. But he just responds by saying 'I am depressed, I am not well and I am not myself after work' but never has he once tried to change this behaviour in himself."		1	0
c2qu1z	2019-06-20 03:20:50		AITA For confronting a friend who had been ignoring my texts for over week	"So  a friend (FWB really, we shared some nights) of mine (we're both  college students) argued with me via text the other day over a political  disagreement regarding minimum wage.  Eventually he told me he had  other things to do and that he would talk more about it later.  Next  day, I feel kinda bad about how I phrased a few things so I text him  ""sorry if I sounded like an ass the other day"".  One day goes by, no  response.  Two days go by, still no response.  Three days, and a fire  happens inside of a parking garage on campus, and I text him pictures of  all of the cars completely caked in smoke from the incident.  Two days  go by, no response.  I ask why he's ignoring me, 12 hours go by and no  response.  I then get pretty upset at this and text him ""You know  ghosting is really cowardly thing to do.  If you're that offended by a  small disagreement, good luck finding anyone in life who fits your  perfect mold.""  This prompts an IMMEDIATE, lengthy response.  He claimed  that he was ""busy with classes and work"" and was going through a rough  patch with his best friend (no surprise there), and that I ""wasn't his  primary concern"". Then he called me an asshole with anger issues, and  that he didn't have to accept or acknowledge my apology if he didn't  want to.

Am I really the asshole in  this situation?  He couldn't take 2 minutes to type a quick response to  my apology and just completely ignores me for a week, then insults my  intelligence as a fellow student who's also taking classes and working  by claiming he was too busy to respond."	Asshole	1	0

They smoke weed so much our house smells of pot, and throughout the day our house shakes from the noise they make.  My roommate has a corgi that is very skittish, and the noise scares her.  We've talked with the manager about it, and it turns out they've also sprayed graffiti all over the side and back of their side of the duplex.  They've recieved an eviction notice from the manager, and they haven't taken well to it.  They're now making as much noise as humanly possible, and we're fed up with it.

I told her she could not be on her phone as it would keep me up she refused and said her phone was already on vibrate/ silent and that she already always turns the light down on it at night so to not burn her eyes. I was pissed and ended up screaming and cussing at her. during the whole trip she refused to do what I said and she told me ""I'm 20. You don't tel l me what to do.

c2qr4d	2019-06-20 03:12:30		AITA for feeling drained whenever my friend talks about her problems?	"Am I the asshole for constantly feeling drained and intentionally ignoring her messages sometimes when we are discussing a problem she has?

We’ve been online friends for about a year now and I really do care for her, it’s just now we don’t even have normal conversations. It’s just her venting and me trying to give advice. If I try to start a conversation, she would give one worded answers so I always drop it in the end. (A couple weeks ago we got into an argument when I told her how I was devastated because my brothers dog was put down. She claimed I never told her about this dog even though I’ve sent videos everytime I saw him and she basically put the blame on me that we don’t even have good conversations anymore, completely ignoring the topic at hand.)

She doesn’t really put in 50%. Daily routine is me sitting there reading her 67+ messages about how she’s stressed from school, complaining about her sister, complaining about her mom, complaining about her dog, and complaining about school while she also complains about being tired. (Maybe complain isn’t the right word but these past few months that’s all I’ve been hearing) She has depression and takes tablets for it. Some of the things she tells me is stuff that I don’t even see the need to be mad at (for example: her dog bothering her for pets, she proceeds to tell me all about she hates the dog and how the dog is taking up her energy, how she has to take care of the dog and it’s such a chore, etc)

At this point she is venting about the exact same things and I have put all my energy into her making sure she’s okay. It’s all the same thing in the end, her ignoring all my responses and just sending “thanks I love you <3” and an hour later the cycle begins again.

I hate to say it but it’s extremely emotionally draining. I have absolutely no problem with her venting to me, it’s just she has sung the same sad tune everyday and doesn’t try to fix anything nor put in the same amount of effort that I do for her. I’ll vent to her, she will just say “aw it’s okay ily” and be done with it. I’m just sick of having her problems hog all of my attention while I can’t work on myself.

Just like right now, she’s currently sending me messages of how bad her workload is. I feel like such a douche for actively postponing seeing them or trying to respond to them as late as possible. I have absolutely nothing to give her anymore because she has done this so many times.

c2qqmi	2019-06-20 03:11:11	throwawaygay173728	AITA for ghosting an old friend after she asked about my living situation?	"Today a friend (we’ll call her Becky) from school messaged me. “Bb 💖 I miss you” I was so happy! Becky was someone I had every single class with from like, 5th grade until our senior year of highschool. We were even super seniors and did an extra summer semester together! Anyways, I actually haven’t talked to Becky for about a year. After we graduated we kept making plans to see each other or to visit our old school and it just never happened.

So today when she messaged me, I was very excited to talk to her! Here’s pretty much the convo: 

Becky: “throwawaygay bb it’s Becky”

Me: “omg!! Becky my luver! I miss you! How are you?” 

Becky: “miss you more 💖 I’m okay how are u” 

Me: “I’m pretty good! Still looking for a job and kinda sad that I can’t but I’ve been doing lots of crafts in the meantime! It’s good to have hobbies u know!”

Becky: “that’s good. I feel you on the job stuff. Can I ask you something?” 

Me: “of course”
(I genuinely thought Becky was just going to ask me to teach her how to make an type of art medium or if she could buy weed from me or something like that )

Becky: “what’s your current living situation?”

I didn’t know how to respond. Just decided I’d think about how to say no. 
After a few minutes she sent me this text too. 

Becky: “i’ve been trying so hard to find a room cuz shits just getting emotionally abusive at home and i can’t live there anymore “

I genuinely had no clue how to respond after that point. I am a HUGE pushover and saying no has always been a huge problem for me. It’s been a few hours, I’m posting on Twitter, I don’t know if I should even respond, or what to say at all. From our exchange about the despair of looking for a jobs, it seemed like she is currently unemployed. 

Am I an asshole for ghosting her instead of saying just saying No? I’m hoping for the best and that maybe this was one of many mass “I miss you 💖” texts that might have she sent out and that she can find a place to stay."	Asshole	0	0

c2qpwd	2019-06-20 03:09:23	_therisingstar	AITA for calling out my roommate and his girlfriend for their loud sex?	"Title pretty much says it all. My roommate and I used to be very close but he’s about to move out (3 weeks from now) and since he decided he was going to leave he’s been less and less considerate. One of the ways he’s been less considerate is having his girlfriend over like 4 nights a week, at least. 

They have sort of an interesting sex life and I’m always very careful to either not have people over when he’s home or I am SUPER quiet, so there’s nothing really comparable. Generally, I don’t have people over when he’s home. He told me that part of the reason she’s always over is because one of her roommates heard them and basically booted them out. Another time, I had a friend stay over (slept on the living room couch) and she told me she’d heard them to the point where she’d had to blast music on headphones to tune them out.

I heard them once having super loud sex before and very kindly said to him the next day “it sounded like the two of you, had a good night, I’d just really appreciate it if that didn’t happen again” and he promised me that he wouldn’t do it again. That was maybe a month ago. He left for a little less than 2 weeks for work and came back last night, bringing the GF with him. First he told me what their plans were and invited me along with them. I declined, because they’re always A Lot to hang out with by themselves - lots of touching, etc. 

So last night I heard incredibly loud, explicit sex around 10:30 or 11pm. I’m pretty sure they thought I was asleep but it was clear moaning, slapping noises, the whole thing. It makes me wonder how much I’ve slept through before and I was really angry about it. It kept me up for a little while and I was anxious about seeing either of them the next morning.

Now what may make me the asshole is that he’s told me before that she has some trouble finishing during sex and that they’ve been working on getting there together. So I guess any signs of her performing well are good, but still. This combined with his general impulsiveness and inconsiderate behavior really bothered me.

I saw them tonight and we had a really normal conversation. Then I said, “Did you guys have a good night last night? It sounds like you had a good night last night.” I didn’t have a crazy mean tone about it or anything but I did make eye contact with my roommate. I’m not sure if she picked up on it but he definitely did. He texted me a few minutes later to tell me I was wildly immature and totally unnecessary. I told him I agreed that my tone was immature but that I needed him to be more considerate. He maintains that I should have said something to him privately and said “I’m honestly done with you.” I think our friendship may genuinely be over.

I feel bad for dragging the girlfriend into it and I feel like a bully because I just don’t like hurting women, but I don’t think I’m totally unjustified in saying something to the two of them, particularly because I had 1) said something before and 2) said something relatively innocuous. What do you all think?

Edit: I really do appreciate you all being on my side!! I’m still feeling guilty because I guess I could have said something to him again - his primary point was that I’d only said something once and never brought it up again - but also how many times does that need to be said??"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2qnzv	2019-06-20 03:04:23	LilAmpy	AITA For refusing to remove my friend’s account from my Xbox?	"My (13M) ‘friend’ (13M) and I have recently gotten into a fight the other day. What happened (About a month ago) he got his Xbox taken away to nobody’s surprise and came over to my house, signed in on his account and then we played Mortal Kombat.

Fast forward to around 2 weeks ago, he called me up and asked if I wanted to go bowling with him. After several minutes of bribing and begging on his part, he says that he’ll get me all of the DLC’s in Forza Horizon 4 if I went with him, knowing how much I loved the game. (I DID NOT SUGGEST HE DID THIS, HE CAME UP WITH IT HIMSELF) After The bowling is done, he gives me the code with all of the add ons, but whisks it away at the last second and says “PSYCHE” and that it was a joke, and he would never do it, and he’s keeping it for himself.

Now since his dad is in the car with us I can’t explode on him and demand for the code because that was the deal, and also because I might get him in trouble if his dad knew he was making $100 dollar deals with his friends, I was forced to hold back tears, say thanks, and walk into my house. 

Fast forward 3 days ago, and I remember that his account is still on my Xbox with no barriers, so I have 24/7 access and I can do whatever I want. So i start by spending all of his VBUCKS (around 2500) and  don’t touch anything else. I also remember that he must have entered in the code by now, so after telling my best friend about the situation he tells me to make my Xbox my home Xbox meaning that as long as his account if on my xbox, I’ll have all of the DLC’s for forza, along with his extensive amount of games. ( I have 4)

He somehow finds out about me “scamming” him and is raging, angry at me, and refuses to listen to me. 

AITA here?

tldr: Me want DLC’s. Rich friend Promises DLC’s, but takes back at last second. Me mad. Me haves his account. Me still gets DLC’s through his account onto my account. He mad. I madder.

Edit: grammar

Edit edit: making my Xbox my home Xbox means that as long as his account is on my Xbox, I can play HIS games on MY account with his account going unaffected. The only thing affected here is his fortnite account for the worse, and my entire Xbox account for the better.

Edit edit edit: The DLC’s for forza are still on my friends account, there is just a double on my account."	Asshole	0	0

"I had to go to the hospital to pick up some test results for which I had called for earlier and we're waiting for me. The hospital parking lot (which is paid and quite pricey) was completely packed and after a couple of times all the way around I made my own parking spot. This was between two cars and was as wide as a regular parking spot, but wasn't one because there was a light pole in the front making it a short spot. I have a small car and it fit perfectly without any issues. This was right near the attendant.

So I get out of the car and start walking towards the attendant and hospital. I was going to explain the situation and that is be right out. However she saw me approaching and started the conversation which went something like this:

Her: Sir that's not a parking spot.
Me: Yes I know, but there are no spots open.
Her: That's still not a parking spot.
Me: I understand, but I've been looking for a spot for 5 minutes and there aren't any. My car fits there without blocking anything and I just need 2 minutes to grab some tests from inside.
Her: You still can't park there.
Me: So if I go inside right now are you going to call a tow truck?

c2qm4k	2019-06-20 02:59:27	Fresh_Breeze	AITA for choosing not to accept a FB friend request from someone I’ve met only once?	"My girlfriend and I had a party a couple of weeks ago. The party guests were really hoping to play the newest Smash game on the Switch, but I didn’t bring that with me. Fortunately, my girlfriend’s best friend’s guy-friend (call him Peter) mentioned that he had his Switch and TV adapter in the car with multiple controllers, and so I asked him if he was willing to bring them in and for the guest to play Smash on the big screen TV (bear in mind, these was my first ever interaction with the guy).

I didn’t participate too much in the video game activities, as I was trying to socialize with other people for a change and meet new people to become friends with. Peter was mostly in the TV room with a group of people playing video games, so we barely interacted. I played a round of Smash with him in an 8 player free-for-all, that was pretty much it. People at the party playing the games said they had a great time with Smash, and so I thanked Peter for being a champ and bringing the equipment out.

Anyways, flash-forward 2-3 weeks, I get a friend request from him on Facebook. I have this rule where I only friend people that I actually know and had some foundation laid out about myself. I don’t like it when people get to know me by just viewing my profile; it just ruins the person-to-person bonding experience, in my opinion, and is just creepy for me that they know where I work/live without me even telling them about it. I planned on accepting it the next time I meet him so that I can get to know him more and vice-versa.

My girlfriend had a lunch date with her best friend yesterday, and she was told that Peter is actually pretty socially inept and has trouble making friends. Also, according to my girlfriend, the best friend was the one that sent the friend request under his profile, not him, so that she can spark a connection between me and him. She did it because she saw at the party how we had common interests in nerdy stuff like video games, Marvel movies, Keanu Reeves, etc, and the dude thought I was a pretty cool guy.

Now, the friend request part I didn’t like, because not only is it going behind Peter’s back, but I felt played as well, thinking that he actually was interested in friending me and took the action to reach out to me in order to get to know me. I know it’s not the dude’s fault at all, and I have absolutely no resentment towards him! I just wished that the best friend had told me directly about his shyness, rather than pull strings on us guys behind a curtain, hoping some chemistry sparks.

So I told my girlfriend my thoughts, and she thinks I’m being an asshole for not helping Peter to come out of his shell and make new friends. The fact that I’m delaying the acceptance of his request until we unforeseeably meet again is “very rude” she says, and that I’ll be hurting his self-esteem if I keep ignoring it.

c2qlt1	2019-06-20 02:58:34		AITA for telling his dad to clean up his own dishes?	"I’m sure many have experienced the “Parental debt” card or the “my asian friend’s son is work slave 24:7 and is Harvard grade so why can’t you be him?” in some form or another.

Basically mom’s overworked from cleaning dishes; indirectly blames it on me and siblings. 

I tell her “I clean all my dishes; blame so and so, not me” for the 20th time.

Next day I tell my sister to shape up cause I’m tired of parents complaining. As far as I can tell she is actually shaping up after I expressed my deep felt need to get my mom to stop complaining about dishes.

Dad fills the empty sink with pans and dishes, so I queried him whether he’s going to clean them. 

He says “I always clean my dishes. What you think I don’t clean them?”

“Well I rarely see you at the sink. But maybe you still do. (Guess we’ll find out)”

Skip time; I see some dishes and I’m about to ask my sister, but my dad is already ahead of me. 

Asian paraphrase “my blood boils at the sight of dishes.” My sister had some dishes not yet clean.

I tell my father “I think building good habits is good, but not everyone has them. You and I clean up after ourselves and sometimes others, but-“

“Wait what do you mean sometimes? If you see dishes, you clean them! Family always helps each other. “

“I agree, you should clean your dishes then. I value good habits and I think things run smoother when everyone simply cleaned their own dishes, even if me and my mom clean everyone elses. 

Don’t you think it’s bit unfair when mom cleans YOUR dishes after work?”

“Look I raised you so you should do my dishes; other Asians do it for free and voluntarily.” (Asian sentence paraphrasing)

“Yeah but the end of the day ma’s still cleaning your dishes. Nobody wants clean your trash forever.”

I just don’t think he can boldly claim “I always clean my dishes” or complain about other people’s cleaning habits when this dude barely cleans up after himself.

I’m not the perfect asian son nor can I ever pay off the living debt, but man have some self-awareness the next time you start bitching again. Here’s big surprise; dude doesn’t learn shit. 

I find myself often coming to the conclusion an inconsiderate dickhead is ingrained in his personality and DNA the next time he will inevitably rant.

Also, I’m not giving you money if you buy weed then don’t have enough for bills. I mentioned something to my wife, but decided it was best to just let it go because I don’t want to argue. Also, they have two daughters (my nieces) that I don’t mind using our account.

I have tried to sign on before and Netflix wouldn’t let me because my account was active on too many devices. No big deal, probably my nieces watching Netflix so I went to Hulu.

c2qh0g	2019-06-20 02:45:40		AITA for not celebrating my Dad (M72) and Stepmom’s (F40) pregnancy announcement?	"This is a throw away account. I’m (M30) an only child born to unwed parents. My parents were old when they had me (~40). My Dad married a younger woman about 10 years ago. 

My Stepmom is WONDERFUL. Even though we’re awkwardly close in age and we hardly speak the same language (she’s from Latin America and my dad speaks fluent Spanish) she’s the most well adjusted parent I have. My Dad is emotionally distant and my biological Mom has a severe personality disorder.

My Dad and Stepmom have been talking about having kids since they got married. I’ve always been against that idea and have verbalized my feelings to my Dad on several occasions. I think there are two real issues with having kids so late in life: 1. My dad won’t be able to be present for his new kid (he’ll get old and die because he’s human), and 2. I’ve always preferred being an child (creepy Ramsey Bolton reference). But actually, it seems inconsiderate to that hypothetical kid and me to have another kid at this point. Also, my wife and I are thinking about having kids soon, so that seems weird. 

My Dad called me last weekend to tell me some “big news.” Apparently my Stepmom is in her third trimester. I’m feeling a ton of pressure to be happy for them. Am I the asshole for not wanting a baby sister?"		1	0

c2qb97	2019-06-20 02:30:17	jiggleonefun	AITA sleeping in my car in a shopping mall parking lot that's technically private?	"Currently homeless. I have a routine where I work during the day, buy food from a grocery store in this open air shopping mall, use their toilet, then sleep in my car from around 11pm to 6am, a time when every other store is closed except the supermarket which is 24 hours. I don't leave any trash, I honestly don't leave any trace, and am in when everyone is gone for the day and out before everyone arrives for the day. And I'm in a compact car, so it's relatively inconspicuous.

No one has confronted me directly. Sometimes other people living in their cars do what I do. Then one day I went to park and there were these new installed floodlights across the entire parking lot. And this rubbed me the wrong way, because I'm in the Bay Area where there is a real and legitimate housing crisis. This isn't fun and games, this is the only way I can afford to get to work the next day and a commute is way too expensive with gas at $3.69 a gallon and a one bedroom being $2,000 a month in Berkeley and $3,000 a month in Alameda. You don't even want to know the prices in SF.

Sure the private property owner has every right, but to treat me like I'm less of a human being, some animal to be abused with a floodlight so I can't sleep, that is degrading. I have my issues, but at the end of the day I'm working just as hard if not harder to make it the next day, and I'm not only a paid customer of the shopping plaza, I'm there during dead hours when it isn't being used anyway. I mean, the total lack of empathy that went into that decision making process, like I'm some racoon to be scared away by a bright blinding floodlight attached from every light pole.

I don't ask anyone for anything. I work for my money and it's not my fault there's no affordable housing between the NIMBYs and the techies starting off at $150k/yr pricing working class people like me out of housing. To me, whoever made the decision to install floodlights to torture homeless people like me, the most vulnerable in society, is TA, and I will continue to do my thing and if anyone wants to confront me about it like a man, I'm here waiting."

c2qalc	2019-06-20 02:28:30	muddyrose	AITA for being vocally/physically grossed out by my brother	"I have a pretty good idea of how this is going to go, but I think my brother needs to hear this. And I could also be surprised, so we'll see. 

I'm trying to type this out as objectively as possible.  

My brother constantly hacks/clears his throat, similar to hocking up a loogie. He gets it into his mouth, then swishes and mooshes it around. 

If you're within 10 ft of him, you can very clearly hear this process. Even if you aren't, the hacking and choking noises are very frequent.  

I have issues with this. I, quite literally, can't stand to be around him when he does this because I start gagging. Listening to him chew on his own snot and phlegm is absolutely disgusting to me. 

I have asked him multiple times, in multiple ways, to stop. Recently I have begun to be very rude and vocal about it. 

He says it's something he has to do, and refuses to stop. He gets very defensive, and has always been very insulting whenever I bring it up. 

This is a strong point of contention between us and we fight a lot about it. 

For what it's worth, I do think that he believes this is something he has to do. He's not (always) doing it to piss me off. He was unable/unwilling to blow his nose until about a year ago. 

He has no medical issues with his sinuses/eyes/ears/etc. and I'm only saying this because it could be pertinent, but he is obese. And the *only* reason I'm adding this information is because someone out there might actually have some advice or help if he truly can't help himself from doing this. 

Regardless of the judgement, I will be showing him these comments to ""end this, once and for all"" so keep that in mind when commenting 

And further info, I moved back home about a year ago and have been struggling with this ever since. I can't afford to move out (hence me moving back in) and he isn't going anywhere. This post is kind of my hail mary."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2q8de	2019-06-20 02:22:27		WIBTA if I told my father he is the reason I don't want kids?	"I've (17m) never really cared for having children. Even growing up in a Christian community, I never really saw the benefits of having kids, and thought very seldomly about it. The way my father (59) raised me showed that he was not ready to have kids, although he is an intelligent man. He abused me and divorced my mother (57), because of their deteriorating relationship and I only got to saw him once every two or three weeks, which probably already painted an awful picture of how a family operates for me, because at the time I was too young to make an impact, but old enough to understand the situation. I'm an only child, hope that helps.

I was told by my mother that they tried really hard to have me, since she was relatively old (40) when I was born. I'm taking a shot in the dark here, but I am guessing that put a lot of stress on their relationship (financial, etc) , which spiralled out of control to the point of abuse. This thought only started bugging me a few days ago, because I put two and two together. It terrifies me to think that both of their lives were probably destroyed by having me, even though no harm was intended.

In my mind, I started to blame my father for everything. For even marrying my mother if he was going to just abuse me and her and eventually leave without thinking about the consequences and trauma that would set in for me, as well as the financial trouble he and she would experience. I've really tried over the last couple of years to reconnect with him, because since Grade 8, I've been living with him, only seeing my mother once every month. This of course made me dig even deeper into my curiosity, as well as asking vague questions about my mother. This sounds unhealthy, and it is, but I wasn't exactly in the best mental spot in Grade 8-9. 


Recently I've felt like I can handle talking about the divorce with him and why it happened, but I don't bring too much attention to it, since it's still unpleasant to bring up. I am scared having kids in my own relationship will eventually lead to its own downfall and my life will take a wrong turn, like it did for my father. Should I confront him about this?


TL;DR: My father's failed relationship with my mother has caused me trauma and as a result, I despise children and relationships and want to confront him about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"To start this, I have been renting a room from my roommate, I'll call her Sarah, for the last two years. Despite Sarah being almost 10 years older than me, we've gotten along incredibly well and have never fought about anything since I moved in. I keep clean, do my thing, she and her boyfriend keep clean and do their thing. Life is good. 

Sarah has two dogs, and one of them is 14 years old. The old pup, Kevin, has been going downhill the last 4-5 months. When I moved in, Kevin was healthy, able to move around freely, and greeted everyone who walked in the door. 


But nowadays Kevin has gone blind, completely deaf, and his nose is partially falling off due to how dry it is. Kevin can still move around and poop, but much like that guy from Zoolander, Kevin just can't turn right. He will turn left 3 times before ever even considering going right. I've never seen a dog that's gotten stuck standing against two walls forming a right angle. 

Today, Kevin had an itch somewhere that neither he, or myself could find. Kevin started frantically walking around our house running headfirst into everything. I could not calm him down at all. It got to the point Kevin yelped, (which by the way I have NEVER heard before), because the itch was so bad. 

Anytime someone brings up his age, Sarah says that when Kevin starts showing signs that he's uncomfortable she'll put him down, but that he's doing just fine now. A few days ago I heard her boyfriend mention to his friends that he's told her multiple times that he thinks it's time to put Kevin down, but Sarah just doesn't think he's doing bad. 

I'm really not a confrontational person, and I like to mind my own business, but I love Kevin. And being that I'm a homebody and constantly see this dog wander mindlessly around the house in counterclockwise looptidoop circle is starting to break my heart. WIBTA if I confronted my roommate and also suggested she consider it time to put Kevin down?

c2q5ir	2019-06-20 02:14:59	DefNotMac	AITA For Pausing The Wifi	"Preemptive TL;DR: I pause the wifi to convince my parents to replace their router because it inconveniences me.

&#x200B;

# Background:

I have pretty standard boomer/gen x parents (54 and 50) who don't super understand the whole internet thing. 

&#x200B;

I used to pause the wifi when my dad would try to send emails and complaints the to local public works dept, since I clear their snow while I'm home from college, and the plow drivers who receive the aforementioned complaints know exactly who is sending them, and which driveway to block in completely.

&#x200B;

After setting up parental controls for when young family members were visiting, I left them on the old router, where some devices would have free reign with just a popup on my phone, and others would be blocked completely. I left it on by mistake a year ago, and saw that my dad is a pornhub **fiend**. Particularly at 12:30am when my mom is finally asleep. He was blocked from the site by mistake on his ipad and went ballistic about me ""breaking"" the router.

&#x200B;

Turns out, I made the right call, because my old man thought that anything Apple was completely safe from every virus ever. For context, this is same guy who offered to match my savings for a college laptop, then took the money out of my account and got a macbook that was old even then, insisting that it was what all the colleges required. I installed windows on it within a month of being at school. 

&#x200B;

But, he got a virus, and it was far from his first. I realized that, when he ordered another new router, all the different ones we'd had were the result of viruses and his accounts being hacked, which he blamed solely on the router.

&#x200B;

The most recent router is my issue. He had geek squad choose and install it while I was away, and it is terrible. While before I would get something that was pricier, since we would have at minimum 7 devices all connected between just my parents, it was usually a good call, everything loaded and nobody was waiting for their netflix. This most recent router was a ""home system"". Not only does my dad insist in keeping the main tower and modem in the far corner of the house, but the range extender nodes are both too far and lose signal.

&#x200B;

# Assholery:

Now, while I'm not a huge gamer, I do play ones that require a solid connection, such as fighting games, and I do stream on twitch as a hobby, and my only source of income until I find a position in my fields. If I had a dollar for every time this new router had decided to drop dead on me, I'd have enough to move out today. So, in an attempt to convince my parents to actually upgrade with the next router, I've begun pausing the wifi on them throughout the day.

&#x200B;

We have the past 2 fully working ones here in the house. I tried using one as an access point, but their current router only allows Linksys nodes to be connected as a security measure and them shits are $80+ on eBay.

Edit: I had offered to buy it myself and was shot down

Edit 2: Probably relevant that I pay 1/2 of the internet bill as well as rent

c2q2ra	2019-06-20 02:07:46	thosecacti	AITA for trying to play devils advocate and show my dad the other side?	"TL:DR at the bottom 

My family is fucked up. My dad hadn’t talked to my aunt, his sister, in almost a year due to an unrelated issue. 

My uncle was diagnosed with cancer awhile back. During this time my aunt took time off work to care for him and also my uncles mother. My uncles mother recently passed away and both me and my mom forced my dad to go to her wake. At the wake I saw my aunt for the first time since my dad last talked to her months ago. She looked like shit. 

We came home from the wake and told my dad that she looked really sick and that something was really wrong. He said “didn’t look at her much” since he only said 2 words to her. 

2 days after the wake my aunt was diagnosed with cancer. My dad has since reached out and is now talking to my aunt and has mended their relationship. 

My dad has no control over his emotions and is extremely polar when it comes to people. He either likes them or hates them, and when he hates them he gets filled with rage to the point where it consumes him. This being said, my dad has decided my aunt getting cancer can be blamed on the fact that she was taking care of my uncle and she let it fester. 

This doesn’t fly for me. He’s said it quite a few times now and I’ve let it slide but it’s getting to the point where he’s enraged by it. Everyone has their way to cope, and maybe getting mad is his, but I am not going to sit idly by and let my dad slander a man who has cancer currently. 

So that brings us to tonight. My dad made yet another comment about how my uncle has made my aunts cancer 1000x worse due to her ignoring the signs and I gently tried to tell him the other side. 

Dad: “she went out to a bar with one of her friends the first week of the month. The next week she was ‘having back pains and too weak’ to go out to dinner with her friend. Clearly her cancer was extremely aggressive to the point where she was laying around idly by letting herself get more and more sick. And he didn’t do anything to help because she had to take care of him [cue tangent about my uncle]” 

Me: “yeah but I don’t think it was this huge drop off. I’m sure her pain came in waves. And who knows maybe it was a combination of pain/fatigue and not wanting to go. We don’t know how she felt” 

That’s just a sample of the conversation considering we went in circles after that. A huge fight ensued. The fight ended with my dad telling me “if I don’t learn how to listen to people and shut the fuck up I will never make it in the corporate world”. 

Once my dad left the room my mom told me I shouldn’t talk to my dad about this anymore as emotions are too high. 

TL:DR my aunt and uncle both have cancer. My dad blames my uncle requiring my aunts assistance/care being the reason her cancer is so bad. I tried to explain to my dad that that might not be the case. A fight ensued.

c2q2a5	2019-06-20 02:06:27	throwaway63851pm	AITA for a dismissive comment I made about a non-binary gender option on a legal form?	"So some background. I'm a pansexual male. I've in the past done some non-masculine behavior, I used to have a somewhat androgynous appearance (I'm a clear male with a beard now), and had a fetish for crossdressing and often felt more comfortable wearing women's panties than male underwear. Once I admitted to these things at some LGBT meetings and forums some people started saying I'm likely transgender. I'm not. I've never suffered from gender dysphoria or believing I wasn't a male despite these things. Ive even been called a ""traitor"" once for refusing to transition. At least one person I had to cut off completely because she wouldn't stop harassing me about this or asking me to ""self reflect"". I've done that, I'm a fucking man. I also got some people then trying to label me ""genderqueer"" or non-binary because I wasn't mentally a woman but didn't always behave like a man. This too is bullshit. I've never felt this way either.

Anyway on a forum there was a thread about general trans issues. I mostly avoid it because I dislike talking about trans issues for the above reasons but I peeked in there. One story was that my state was now adding an ""X"" option to driver's licenses in addition to ""M"" and ""F"". I remarked something like ""Wow now I actually can't wait to renew my driver's license so I can NOT choose this option.""

A lot of people got pissed at me and said this was an asshole remark. But I made it in light of the past issues above. So was I being a dick?"	Asshole	0	0
c2q1t1	2019-06-20 02:05:08	throwaway16448	AITA for feeling like my BF's mother will be our breaking point?	"She doesn't like me, I don't know if that matters much.

She is constantly making him do things around the house, which yes, he lives there and he should do chores..but these are things she refuses to do and runs off to do something else so she doesn't have to like take care of their pack (yes PACK) of dogs all by himself and practically co-parent his younger brother who she refuses to let be home by himself even though he is 14 years old  (she is an INTENSE helicopter parent. She got pissed off at a college admissions office for telling her she was being one when she tried to get my BF's information she didn't have a right to) She is always trying to have a say in what he does, his school, his job, even his free time.

My BF will make plans to do something and she'll snap back and tell him he has to do all these errands because she's going to be out. But the worst part is he doesn't fight back, he just says ""okay/be there soon"" when he's here or as he's about to leave to see me. He lives an hour away from me and stays at my house for 4-5 days out of the week, as he is also trying to MOVE OUT.

Because of her helicopter attitude, he took to lying to her at a young age about things, which made her even worse, and they just festered off of each other that way. He lies to her constantly about even tiny things like buying water late! I have to tell him to just be honest because it's not a big deal. She'll ""force"" him to go back home if she's mad at him or feels he needs to be there.

And the main issue I have is he doesn't say no! He doesn't tell her he CAN'T or that he won't. Today I had a very VERY important doctor appointment that he promised to bring me to, I had no other ride. He tells me THE DAY OF that he suddenly has to go back down and babysit his 14 year old brother. I had told him I needed him to take me to this appointment because it's for several serious things, he said okay and that he'd tell his mother he couldn't. A little less than an hour before we're to head out to the appointment his mother calls and asks where he is. He says he hasn't left yet and is on his way. I just looked at him, and I blew up. I was thankfully able to reschedule my appointment before my doctor is to go on vacation, and thankfully I have a reliable ride to it. 

I got so mad at him, I told him he should have told her and to pack his things and not come back. I was livid.

It took a few hours for me to calm down, I took off my ring and went to visit my dad and grandpa.

Now my BF is on his way back because I told him we needed to have a serious conversation about this. This kind of thing has happened before with me nearly breaking up with him over his overbearing mother and refusal to stand up to her.

So, am I the asshole for feeling like this is going to be our breaking point and reacting rather angrily to the situation? I never yelled, but it was obvious I was livid.

Okay so my boyfriend, has a really close friend who didn’t like the fact me and him started dating.
Before me and the boyfriend got together mutual friends warned me that he can be bitchy and cruel when he believes somethings his. I took limited notice of this because at the time me and the boy had no issues and I (stupidly) believed that what they where saying was stupid because he seemed like a lovely person.
About a month into our relationship, this friends behaviour started to change - before I say the next part, this friend was in a long term relationship with another boy- towards my boyfriend. He became very touchy and flirty with my boyfriend and started to ice me out. I told my boyfriend that it wasn’t appropriate for that sort of behaviour as not only did it make me feel uncomfortable but other members of our friend group. My request went not abided by as my boyfriend decided to give the friend a chance and see if his behaviour improves. 
Soon after, it became apparent that no one wanted me around in the group anymore because I was apparently ‘threatening’ to this boy or something ( this was like 8 months ago I struggle to remember the specific reason he gave people, just some BS). My boyfriend and I decide to give everyone some air to breath and distance ourselves but keep contact with those who want to.
Over the next three months, this friend was constantly saying my boyfriend doesn’t love me, flirting with my boyfriend, saying I’m abusive towards my boyfriend ( as my previous relationship before said boyfriend was abusive this comment hurt the most) and making remarks about me.
Now at this point I was beyond pissed. I decided to message this boy basically telling him to fuck off and that his behaviour was unacceptable. All his actions where really upsetting my boyfriend as he was spinning tales to him saying I was bullying him and trying to remove him from all his friends. 
Mine and the boyfriends relationship got a bit rocky for a while as he was being told that I was the one who was the dickhead and the message I sent was bullying. Boyfriend even said to me ‘you where the one that started icing everyone out not (friends name)’. That hurt so much let me tell you. 
Eventually friend admits that everything he’s been saying is bullshit. Not one single apology from anyone about the whole situation, I was just meant to suck it up. 
Anyways, I asked my boyfriend to not be friends with this friend anymore, however they still are. Am I an asshole for how I handled the situation and for asking my boyfriend to stop being friends with this person ?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2pzb0	2019-06-20 01:58:29		AITA for not wanting to watch “When They See Us” With My Girlfriend?	"So, I was hanging out with my girlfriend, and we were trying to decide on what to watch. We had settled on “Little Shop of Horrors,” but then she suggested we watch “When They See Us”. I was familiar with the entire story of the Central Park Five case, and it really upsets me me.

I’m not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but I’m Italian and Jewish, and my girlfriend is Liberian-American. We’re both progressive when it comes to politics, and I don’t have anything against the story. In fact, I thought the show to be necessary to prevent people from forgetting the travesty that occurred.

With that being said, and my views on it being clear, I didn’t want to watch it. It really depresses me and puts me in a very outraged mindset, and I really was in no shape or way wanting to watch something that I knew would make me feel like that. She wanted to watch it, and I eventually relented and said, “hey, one episode won’t hurt”.

I was wrong. It was fucking heartbreaking. Absolutely devastating in every way, and I found myself really upset, despite already knowing the facts.

Basically, User E and User N had a fight scene planned between Character E and character N. I wanted to bring Character C to it and they agreed, but warned me that they wanted to keep the number of people as low as possible. I decided that since they were letting me join, and no one else seemed to want to, it was fine.

Fast forward months later after I got banned after leaving, and was now perusing the Discord server for the RP using an alt account. User E said about me, ""He almost ruined the encounter"". Turns out he and his crony were talking about me behind my back the entire time while pretending to be nice to me to my face.

What the fuck? You were the one who let me come! All I did was ask for permission which you granted, and then that was it! As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't me that ""almost ruined"" it, but rather this conniving, two-faced, sneaky, ungrateful (I had drawn something for him) spoilt little brat.

In that same conversation, User N said that my character's motivation for wanting to join the fight ""came right out of freaking nowhere"" when there actually was a reason for it. But of course they have to ignore that, because they want to talk as much shit as possible about a guy who is no longer around to defend himself.

Out of everyone I dealt with, User E was arguably the worst."	Not enough info	0	0

I have a 5:30am flight across the country to visits some relatives for a 10 day trip. 

My mom brings me to airports at 4:00, normally it takes about 15mins to get through security at this airport and I was planning on waiting for an hour to be safe.

However we get there and there is construction at security so the line is insanely long about 45mins, which is no problem I can wait because I have time. Wait in line for 40 mins get to the frontish and notice it is PSA Precheck line, which I am not. I sprint to the end of the normal line which is about a 50 minute wait at this rate I will still be in line and my plane will take off. Run over to other security line which is slightly shorter but I will still miss flight by a lot.

My parent tries to register me for short line but is unable to obviously. Out of ideas my parent brings me to the edge of the front of the line and lies to family and asks if I can go with them and tells them I’m on a school trip and there’s no way I can get there if is miss flight (again I’m just visiting family by myself).
Lady says yes let’s me go in front of her, go through security, sprint to my plane and make it by a couple minutes. 

I understand that there were probably people behind me who were in a rush for their flights and got their early, I don’t think I’m entitled to cut and I just followed my parents lie. AITA for going along with it"	Asshole	0	0
c2pwr9	2019-06-20 01:51:39	plmnkothrowaway	AITA for throwing out my wife’s eyebrow tweezers?	My wife had an obsession with over plucking her eyebrows and recently she decided she wanted to stop and grow them out. Last week, she gave me her eyebrow tweezers and told me to hold on to them and not let her get to them. She only asked for it once a couple days ago and I convinced her it was a bad idea and she appreciated it and was happy I didn’t let her get it. I’ll admit I was pretty close to giving it to her because I love her and like giving her everything she wants. So anyways, I decided that in order for me not to give in I had to get rid of the tweezers so I threw them out. I thought once she grew them out I can just get her a new pair since they looked pretty cheap anyways. Today we were getting ready for a wedding and she asked for the tweezers to “get rid of one hair that’s bothering her”. I kept trying to tell her no but she insisted that it was one hair and I can watch her only pluck that hair. That’s when I told her I threw them out and she freaked out because they were expensive salon tweezers that were discontinued. She became really upset and said she’s never trusting me with her stuff again. AITA?	Asshole	0	0
c2pvc1	2019-06-20 01:48:06	FearlessRecover	AITA Old Friend instigated Relationship - we started a project, friend threw me out of the very project - published on her own then ended relationship.	"Hi

So i have been flirting with this girl for quite a while now, and I never really dared to ask her out or something because I considered her a good friend of mine, and she also had been the ex of a formerly good friend of mine. Long story short she brought me over to her place because we wanted to drink something after the bar closed.

From that day on we hang out the whole time, her being an old friend (10 years) makes me feel really attached to her and i feel something like a bond. She seems to be very into me, and we joke a lot and have fun talking about common friends and i realize that we like the same food, the same interests to and all that. I am considering a relationship with her but i have an inhibition to ask her, after a time i do, and she tells me that she wants a ""best friend"" not a boyfriend. I really don't understand this concept. OK, i tell her that any way of relationship is fine with me, i consider what has happened between us something special - and after all every relationship is different. She seems to be OK with that.

Fast forward a few days - i have to go to another city. I keep in touch with the girl, right now we have agreed to write a text together about a topic i have been researching for like 5 months. She tells me that she pitched it to a paper, and they said yes, it was not the big paper i wished the text to go to - but whatever an ok from a paper is good enough. (I have published quite a lot, its part of my job). We start working. Every day i wake her up with a call, sometimes she comes in late, but every day i send her a text first and then i call her, so she can wake up early to wake up ( I am normally a early bird) The last day i oversleep - (we never had arranged any time to wake up it was just always agreed that the first person up calls the other. Ok, send her a message. Right away she writes back. I am a bit taken aback, and ask her when did she wake up. She tells me that she is already more than 3 hours on the text. I am quite shocked. Then the next shock - she tells me that after 4 days of compiling our combined efforts in an online document, she had deleted all my contributions and tells me that she can't fit my stuff in. Strange after all we developed the idea fro the text together.  I ask her why she deleted it, and she could not come up with an answer that made sense. Just something about the deadline. The next time i call her she is ice cold.  Business like. Tells me that she will publish the text alone. I feel reall used.  Afterwards i try to get a hold of her. She writes to me ""Cant talk right now"" Next day i write her a message to ask her if she wants to cancel the relationship, as he is giving me mixed info and i would like to know i am misreading her text only communications. She does not reply for another day. Then tells me she only wants to be friends with me.

Thats when i blocked her.

c2ptkf	2019-06-20 01:43:18	Throwaway8353826285	AITA for not telling my best friend that I was paralyzed?	"Okay so here’s some backstory. I met my friend 10 years ago in high school. We went to the same high school and college and have spoken everyday since the day we met. After college, we parted ways and moved to different states to pursue job opportunities yet we have still maintained contact through text and call. A year after we graduated college, I was in a bad car wreck and ended up a paraplegic. I lost a lot of friends over it and felt like I lost a part of myself. It seemed like all anyone ever wanted to do was pity me for being disabled. I told my friend I was in a car wreck but that I is as fine.

Business as usual. Texting everyday and all that. I continued to not mention I was a paraplegic or in a wheelchair. It was nice having on friend that didn’t pity me or treat me differently after the accident. Having a friend I didn’t have to talk about the wreck with. I was still “me” with the friend. I had originally planned on telling her what happened but a few weeks of me wanting normalcy turned into a few months and then a few years. Then it felt like too late to ever tell her. 

Then one day, she told me she really wanted to come visit me and had a week off of work while she transferred from one department to the other and that she was flying in to see me. I panicked and acted excited but knew I couldn’t keep this from her any longer. So I told her how excited I was to see her and cleared my weekend so we could spent time together. I ended up calling back a couple of days later from guilt and poured my heart out confessing the truth. She was sobbing over the phone because of how upset and angry she was that I hadn’t told her and had been lying to her for so many years. I tried to explain my reasoning behind not telling her but that just made her more mad. She said she was hurt that I thought she’d treat me any differently and that I didn’t know her at all. 

She has been ignoring my texts and calls for a week now and I’m sure our reunion was cancelled. I’m so upset that this happened and so angry at myself for not telling her right away.

c2psfh	2019-06-20 01:40:16		AITA for eating meat when I visit my family but eating vegetarian at (my) home and with my boyfriend and friends?	I grew up in a very meat heavy household, where they eat meat with every meal and its just a given. My dad regularly makes fun of vegetarians and vegans and also does not give a single shit about the environment or animal rights (he does like cats and dogs though). My sister says she doesn’t feel full without meat and a vegan/vegetarian diet isn’t “good for you”. Basically, my family is very conservative and I really don’t like to argue with them for the short times I do see them, because honestly it’s just like talking to a brick wall and only ends with me being upset. I moved away for college 2 and 1/2 years ago and I only come back to visit for holidays, so ~4 times a year. About 2 years ago I reduced my meat consumption due to chronic stomach issues and noticed that eating less meat helped alleviate some of my issues, and eventually I stopped eating meat altogether. I also came to realize the negative impacts of factory farming on the environment and the cruelty to animals. I met my boyfriend about 1 year ago, so I’ve been a vegetarian since before we knew each other. For the record, I don’t judge him for eating meat, or even discourage it, I say to each their own but I do offer him my tasty veggie foods, which he enjoys. Anyways, when I go home to visit my family, for almost every meal, meat is served, so I eat a small piece because there are no real alternatives and I do not want to start a debate about vegetarianism and my life choices. I went home over the weekend for father’s day and we barbecued, I ate a piece of chicken with dinner. Last night with my bf I told him about my father’s day, including our dinner, and he got kind of mad and said I was a hypocrite for eating meat and asked why I eat meat with my family but not with him? I told him  that I don’t eat meat with him because I feel like I can be myself around him and that I won’t be judged for eating vegetarian or have to justify it with him the way I would with my family. The conversation kind of ended there, and things were good after, but then today on the phone he made a “joke” about how I eat meat with everyone but him. I didn’t really find it funny, so I asked why he would make a joke like that and if he was mad at me for eating meat with my family? He said it was just a joke and then ended the call. I definitely do feel like a hypocrite now but am I really in the wrong here? AITA?	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2pse5	2019-06-20 01:40:10	xSolid_Snakex	AITA For getting upset with my fiancee for giving our 9 year old my computer password?	"We have a 9 year old daughter that likes to play Minecraft on my computer occasionally. I have absolutely no problem with her playing or being on my computer and usually even help her play. However, my computer is also filled with very sensitive data used for work, not to mention several adult photos and videos. 

She is very responsible for her age and I trust her on my computer as she purely uses it for just Minecraft and sometimes YouTube, but I still feel more comfortable supervising her while she's on. 

About two weeks ago I started a new job and my daughter has been spending the day at home with my fiancee. Yesterday I came home and saw her playing Minecraft on my computer. This alone didn't really bother me, but then she told me that ""mommy told me your password"" and then proceeded to tell me what it is. 

I told my fiancee that I was upset that she gave away my password (which also happens to be my social security number) without asking me first if it's ok. She thought that I had absolutely no reason to be mad since she's been on my computer before and thinks I'm being an asshole. Our daughter heard our conversation and got upset with me too. I apologized and said I feel bad for upsetting her because she's completely innocent in this situation. But I still feel like it's justified for me getting upset with my fiancee because she didn't consider if my password was something I wanted our daughter to know.

Edit: Thanks everyone for all the helpful advice. I've created a separate account for her and she absolutely loves it. As for my password being my SSN, I know I'm an idiot for using that as my password believe me. But to be fair, when I first set that up as my password years ago, I was living by myself with no WiFi and it's a huge gaming desktop so the risk it being hacked or stolen was fairly low. Anyways, I've now changed my password to ""password123"" so I'm positive nobody will ever guess it. Thanks again guys!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I can normally hear people just fine but I have the worst luck with customers. They either stand too far away, mumble, whisper, don't know what they're saying/guessing or just gesture at me. Somehow people can make ""tomato"" sound like ""mayo"" it gets really annoying constantly correcting their order because I couldn't hear them.

I can't wear a pin on my hat or anything so I just politely say, ""Oh sorry, I'm legally deaf :)"" while fixing their order.

For the most part people laugh and speak a bit louder. I realized though it comes off as a bit defensive because sometimes they give me a look like, ""Uh huh. Yeah. Sure. You don't look deaf. Whatever."" 

I try to say it in the most lightheartened tone since I'm pretty chipper and make neat clean sandwiches to, prove I'm not being rude? Idk, I just make super neat clean sandwich.

c2pr2j	2019-06-20 01:36:43	Perk_i	AITA for wanting to eat dinner half an hour before a restaurant closes?	"My girlfriend works in a retail setting.  I have not for many years.  Neither of us has ever worked in a sit-down restaurant.  Last night I really wanted to go out to dinner rather than cook, but it was fairly late and we wouldn't have made it to the casual dining restaurant until half an hour *before* their closing time.  My girlfriend insisted that by the time we finished it would be at least forty five minutes after closing and that we were being rude to the restaurant staff who just want to go home on time.  My position was that we'd hardly be the only ones the staff was waiting on and that they have no real expectation of going home at closing time anyway - most restaurant staff are going to be on shift for an hour or two after the customers leave cleaning up and tearing down.  We had a mild fight about it and ended up ordering pizza.

So Am I the Asshole?  I always tip 20%+ (U.S.) and try to tip in cash when possible as I'm aware of the prevailing wage laws for wait staff.  I wouldn't think they'd object to seating another paying guest close to closing time, even if the guest may still be eating after close.  I admittedly have never worked as a waiter however, am I being rude and keeping someone past their shift?"	Asshole	0	0
c2pqwc	2019-06-20 01:36:18	Certified_NutSmoker	WIBTA if I send my mother a letter of grievances and don’t invite her to my college graduation?	"I was never a “good” kid. I always got into trouble in school and this obviously put a strain on my parents. However, by the time I was about 13 I cleaned up my act. I started to actually excel in school and eventually got pretty involved with JROTC. When I was 15 I decided to take Calculus and Physics at the nearby community college the following fall, because my high school didn’t offer them. At around the same time, my mother, who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Oregon, began to talk about moving away from rural Arkansas where I grew up. 

This is where things started to get pretty complicated. Late spring of that year, my mother called me into her room and asked me if she “could leave.” At first I wasn’t sure what she was asking, but she explained her plan was to go back to Oregon to find work. Then, once she was stable, we could all join her. In the meantime, my stepfather would stay with me. However, my parents quickly found out they could not afford rent on two places at once and convinced my older sister to rent the house and take care of me. My stepfather went to go live with my step-grandparents(sgp) down the road to take care of my sick sgp.

Things went fine until winter when my sister decided to move out to her boyfriend’s. I thought that one of my parents would come back and stay in the house with me, but instead I went to my sgp and, along with my stepfather, they asked me straight up, at 16, “What are you going to do?” I had a job, but it could not cover nearly everything. I ended up staying with friends for long periods of time, eventually working up the nerve to ask “Could I live with you?” Unfortunately, a lot of people are taken aback by questions like that and I always felt awkward asking. However, eventually, I was allowed to stay on a sheep farm for $300 a month. I couldn’t afford it because my job refused to give me more hours, but it was the only option I had. I begged my parents to cover the difference and after a bit of back and forth, they agreed.

Thankfully, from there, my life began to change. In my Junior year of high school, I received a full scholarship to boarding school. At boarding school, I found a love for mathematics and have gone on to study math at one of the top private universities in America. Next year I will graduate, and I don’t want to invite my mother to graduation. I am partly still upset that even though all this shit has happened, we have never talked about it. And partly upset because nothing has changed. Recently she has been contacting me asking about graduation, but I am on the fence. I don’t think she has made a good faith effort to get to know me or be present when it mattered and only at the end of college does it seem she might care. She did not even try to come to my graduation from boarding school. So, WIBTA if I sent my mother a letter explaining why I feel this way, and informing her she is not to come to my graduation?"

My brother wanted his hair to be a certain length out of nowhere. I was playing in his hair one day and he asked me to do his entire head. At first it was fun and I had no problem with it. Now it's just tedious.

Now he holds it over my head because he works at a country club that it's apart of the dress code, as if I have anything to do with it.

He pays me sometimes but the shit doesn't add up. Braiding hair isn't fast or easy. Especially since he wants specific hairstyles. Not just cornrows or plaits. I have no interest in being a hair stylist.

He thinks because I don't have a job and I don't go to school til this fall that I'm not busy. I'm a singer, I write, and I draw. I've been trying to strengthen those before I start school.

I tried requesting regular payment but he just said to me, ""if you're gonna ask me to pay you then I wouldn't have asked you to do it in the first place"" but still continued to ask me.

Then, despite feeling pressured and not being good at saying ""no"", I said a firm no. He argued with me like he always did, knowing I'm a punk and if he tries enough I'll say yes, but I put my foot down. He promptly threw a tantrum and cried. This is a grown man.

The other reason I don't want to do it is because he is a shitty person. He made fun of me during my darkest days, pointing at a girl on the tv saying ""look she ____ herself just like you!"". WHILE I WAS DOING HIS FUCKING HAIR. He's homophobic and constantly yells at me and insults me. But he'll come back around and do ""damage control"" by smiling in my face and speaking in a sweet voice. Through the years I don't want to be near him let alone speak to him or do deeds for him.

c2pncw	2019-06-20 01:27:06	elementfinest	AITA for hating my uncle	"So i am talking about my aunt's (my mother's sister) boyfriend. Let's call him Adam. They are together for 22 years (since they were 15) and they have 2 children. I think they are both snakes and let me explain why.

I met him 10 years ago for the first time and at first i thought he was cool. Everytime we had lunch at my grandmother's place, he was so friendly and everybody accepted him into the family.

Then the problems started. My mom was selling her car and somebody wanted to buy it for low price (it was not worth alot). Then Adam said he would buy it and she sold the car to him, because he is family. We thought he would use it, because they only had 1 car, but no, he ""fix"" it and sold it to someone else for more money. Maybe I am wrong here but I would be very angry if my boyfriend did this to my brother. Basicly making money off of his family.

Then when my mom was buying a new car he said that he has a friend who is selling cars, so she bought a car from his friend and it was working fine for some time, but then we discovered that the chassis was damaged all this time, so she had to pay alot of money to fix it. What bothers me here is the fact that Adam and his friend said the car was just like it was new.

The next thing was my birthday. I invited everyone to lunch in the best restaurant in my city (including Adam). Then one of his friends called him on the phone and he said he had to go and would be back in 20 min. He came back in 45 minutes when we finished our meals, he didn't eat anything when he came back so I threw my money away because he had to go somewhere. And it was not anything important. At this point i've already hated him and then this happened on top of everything else.

And the last thing. My mom and my aunt have a cousin and he is literally the best. Let's call him Mike. He and his family live in the countryside 1.5h away from us, but we (without my aunt and Adam) visit each other often. My aunt and Adam were there only once.  Me and Mike's children are around same age and i would say we are good friends.

So first of all, I think Adam is doing some illegal things. He doesn't have a job, but he is always doing something. So not too long ago Mike's daughter told me that Adam called and said he had a lot of fertilizers to sell and asked if Mike could help him sell it. So he helped him and at the end, Adam was supposed to give him some fertilizers for free because he helped him. Mike called him many times and he didn't pick up the phone, then he said that he doesn't have fertilizers anymore and blocked his number. Adam also owe money to Mike's friend, who delivered fertilizers to buyers. Also Mike didn't tell this to anyone in my family because he didn't want to cause any drama.

I don't know if i am overreacting but i HATE Adam. I don't even talk to him and I don't like my aunt either. She is always aroud when and if she is benefiting from it.  Everyone is saying that we shoud accept him because he is a part of the family now, but I can't stand him. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2pj0f	2019-06-20 01:15:18	throwaway3654776	AITA for befriending my best friend’s ex?	"So I guess I should preface by saying that they aren’t even really “exes.” They went on one date, never kissed or did anything physical - but my best friend is in love with this girl and is very heartbroken that it didn’t work out. The “ex” was very passive and not super considerate in the “relationship”, but she’s a good person and never did really anything super wrong. Even best friend acknowledges this. 

Before the break-up, we were all part of the same friend group. My social life was pretty tied up with all of them, we would party together, get together at least once a week to talk about different topics we were interested in over wine, etc. And the ex and I always had great conversations, even when we were drunk at a party. The only thing is - the ex and I only really started getting to know each other better while her and my friend were dating, so we never got to get closer by the time they broke up. 

After the breakup, my social life came to a complete halt because most of our friends are better friends with the ex than with my friend, so we just stopped attending any of the parties/weekly discussions/hangouts, etc. I realized after a while that I really need my social life. 

The problem is though...that I KNOW if I go to parties, for example, I’m probably gonna end up talking/hanging out with the ex for a large chunk of the time just because we really get along, have good intellectual conversations, and have a fun time together! (And it’s completely platonic too, so that’s not a concern.) So it makes me wary and nervous to go to parties because I don’t want to be too friendly with her or talk to her too much. Before the breakup, it was like this at the parties too - I would talk to the ex the most because we really got along, so it’s not like this is new. 

So basically, I’m losing my social life and I don’t want that because it’s making me miserable. This is what my friends are doing, and I want to join in. But I KNOW that if I do, I’m gonna end up becoming closer to my friend’s ex and probably eventually become good friends with her. This makes my friend feel kinda weird and uncomfortable, but she still wants me to do whatever is best for me and makes me happy and doesn’t want to stop me (this is what she told me). And it’s hard because...if I’m being honest, I DO want to be friends with her! We got along great, and participating in my social life literally puts me in a situation where I’m gonna gravitate towards the ex, the person I enjoy my time with the most in that group and will probably lead us to developing a real friendship. I just don’t know what the right thing to do is.

It’s not just parties either - it’s also the weekly discussion groups over wine, all of these social situations put me in this awkward position. Also, just to reiterate, all of this is pure, platonic friendship!!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2pidy	2019-06-20 01:13:40	RATATATaudiecat	AITA for not wanting my friend to work with me?	"So it’s the end of the year and one of my teachers decided to give us a mini project. So I was going over to my friends when one of them said, “oh (my friend who I will refer to as T) doesn’t have a group, I’m going to work with them this time,” we agreed because it sounded fine. But me and another friend (who I will refer to as A) knew how T gets, and that he would criticize everything we did. We talked about it a bit, and thence dropped it. The next day, we really didn’t want to work with him, so we decided to tell him. 

“Hey T, we don’t want you to criticize us like always,” I said. 

Here’s some backstory: Recently, A was sketching something she had been working on for a while, and she was really liking how it was turning out. It was a lotus flower, in which T had said, “wow it is so ugly A,” which could make anyone feel bad. This hasn’t been the first time as well. He always acts like his work is better, and that you are doing it wrong. 

Back to the present, I could tell I really hurt his feelings. He stayed silent for a good five minutes. I felt so bad, so I sincerely apologized, and he finally started working with the rest of us. Whenever he shared an idea, I was quick to shoot it down, because I thought they were simply ridiculous. Now I realize how that may have been a dick move. 

After that, he didn’t want to talk to me and A, so we wrote a letter telling him how sorry we were. I feel so bad about hurting his feelings, but I don’t know if our actions are justified."	Asshole	0	0
c2pi3t	2019-06-20 01:12:57	Khanradical	AITA for telling my wife that I would leave her if she took our son to her (IMO) racists Uncle's house for the Holidays?	"All apologies for format & spelling errors.

Two years in to dating (my now wife) I was introduced to her Aunts boyfriend. Since that day & everytime we've met  afterwords (barring some occasions) he would make racist remarks towards me, such as Hodji, Mohammad, wet back, beaner, ISIS; basic racist names for a brown guy who isn't black.

Being a POC all my life (38 years now) I have two responses to shit like this, either violence (& I'm not a bad ass as I have the body of wacky wavy inflatable tube man) or I use humor. Making dumb-dumbs laugh is easy and no violence is good for everyone. And because my wife's Aunt is her favorite person/relative (she calls her her '2nd Mom') in these situations I would choose the latter.

Another shitty thing is that on four separate occasions he has alluded that he could shoot me (he open carries) or would ask me how ""fast I am"" and would gesture towards his gun. I grew up in a very abusive household (that is a whole other thread itself) and when presented w/ violence or threats I would confront it head-on. In situations like this I would say ""Try it & see what the fuck happens"" (or something along those lines) and he would of course always back down.

Now here we are 8 years later. He married my wifes Aunt and my wife & I have 6 month old. About a month or two before the kid was a born, we saw each other and he made some shitty racist remark and I snapped. I looked him and screamed at him that I was sick of this racist shit and after several uncomfortable seconds of us staring in silence I walked off. I stopped going to my in-law family functions to avoid him. Outta sight, outta mind. 

But now that we have a kid it gets complicated.This Christmas is going to be at their house. I told my wife that I would sooner leave her then allow my child to be around him. I told her if she wants to go that's her prerogative, but we arn't going. And if she really wants to take him that's fine, but I will pack up and file for divorce.

I feel like an asshole. Giving ultimatums to people you love is the ultimate shit head move, but I don't know what else to do. AITA?


*EDIT* Thank you kind internet strangers for your time and responses. I feel a little better, but my wife and I have some work ahead of us (counseling).

*EDIT 2* Thank you again Internet people. I did a lot of reading this morning through this thread. I really appreciate you taking your time in throwing in your two cents. On a couple of things that I left out:

-Wife hates the racism that she has seen from the Uncle. She has spoken up about it. I do believe that because my response to it has been to 'joke it off' made it seem like a not a big deal. Which I truly believe is my fault for not communicating this earlier. Her response to ""Why are you okay with having our kid around him?"" was that we have both been raised in racist families and that we both came out level headed, why wouldn't our child? Which I understand to a degree. However being a first time dad & I have no idea what I'm doing, I just know I want to do it differently than I was raised. 

-The Wife has only seen one interaction where I was threatened with a gun. Please keep in mind he has never pulled it out, it was only implied. She was beyond upset at that. However I believe it was brushed off as ""well he was drunk and he's all talk"". Which, yes, yes he is.  My issue is that we now have a child in this. If he wants to have a dick measuring contest with me, fine get the ruler. But now there's a tiny person in this equation and that's a game I don't want to play. Even if it is just 'talk'.

-I don't want to leave her at all. I love this woman and cant imagine a life with out her. Since my little outburst I have been freaking out. I've broken out in what the Doctor calls a stress rash and I have had a frontal migraine for the past three days. My body is literally punishing me for my dumb mouth. However if we do go down this route, I do believe we would share custody. She is not an vindictive person.

-I would like the clarify the ultimatum I made. It was that if she would bring our child to their house I would have no choice but to leave. She can take the child anywhere, but not there. I am not forbidding the child to not see everyone in her family. There would even still be interaction with the Aunt and Uncle (she has a huge family, who all like to hang out) at other family remembers homes, but I believe it would be more controlled in those environments. I would *never* tell her who she can or cannot see, I would have no right to. When it comes to this Christmas, I told her she can go and when people ask where I or our child is all she would have to respond with was ""Well there's been too many racist remarks and threats and we don't want our kid around that shit.""

Again, thank you to all for your help on this."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2pgwi	2019-06-20 01:09:48	yejkegenru	AITA for not wanting anything to do with my wife?	"So I don't mean in general. I love her. But I mean this specific instance. 

I got home after a long 16 hour day, I'm exhausted, I'm hungry and I'm just...tired. I walk in, she's in the shower, I get the dog, take if my boots and go to the kitchen and start cooking myself a meal since there's no food. She comes over, stands in front of the stove and I'll be honest I got irritated. I understand that I just got home, I should've hugged her said hi and what not but I was irritable and hungry so I wanted to cook myself some food. 

She got upset because I said ""babe seriously, get out of the way I'm trying to cook some food""

She leaves the kitchen. I continue cooking. She doesn't really work right now because of reasons but she stays home most of the day, but can't seem to find time to clean the kitchen. So I get irritated at that sometimes but today I said ""come in here and help me clean"" I didn't ask. Because then it'll just be me and today I don't think it's fair. 

It's not a serious issue but I told her to just leave me alone. So now she's in the room and I'm still cooking and I'm wondering if I am asshole for wanting to eat a meal when I get home after working such a long shift and coming home to realize nothing has happened all day.

Edit: the reason she stays home isnt children or nothing like that. She used to work but decided her career wasn't where she wanted it so went back to school to complete her master's and in the mean time isn't working to finish as quick as possible. All she does is school all day right now. That's fine. We agreed on it but I pick up a few extra hours to supplement the income she used to bring in while we finish this and she gets a better gig.

c2pg3i	2019-06-20 01:07:48	FallVixen	AITA for catching up with an old acquaintance over a game of pool?	"So here's the deal I really don't know if I'm in the wrong here? Earlier today I had an old acquaintance who I recently got reconnected with (do the fact my dad now works with his landlord helping rebuild his house) ask me if I wanted catch up over a game of pool at the local pool house/bar. This was mentioned at around 12:00pm to which I had agreed as it sounded like a good time and set plans to meet up around 7:30pm after got off work and ate supper. Now here is where I was wondering if I really am the A**hole. My roommates, girlfriend, and I are all part of a Facebook group chat to which we are all really active in and I made a mention in the chat (which I was just talking to my GF in not 30 seconds before) that I had made plans to catch up with this acquaintance making sure to mention where and when and with who. This message was sent at 1:00pm and I though all was good until I got home for supper that is. When I got home I was immediately put on blast by my GF,
""You didn't even ask me you just said this is what's happening you should have at least said would you mind if I did this""
 ""you should have given me a heads up."" 
"" you're dating me not the group."" 
""Everything about this is shady, you should have message me directly."" 
""I don't like the idea of you meeting up with a sketchy guy at a bar I don't know"" 
""It almost like you completely forgot that we have been dating for 9 months, what you did was stupid, where you even thinking"" 
That was just a bit of what was said to which I did apologize for not messaging her directly and told her that in the future i would ask her before hand before agreeing to plans and to not go to a bar but instead get a coffee.  I also made a mention that neither him nor I would be drinking. I don't feel like what I did was wrong I made sure to let her know with who, when, where, when I would be back, and that there would be no drinking. All of which was mentioned in ample time and a way she was guaranteed to read. So I want to know AITA or was she over reacting to the situation?

BTW I feel I should also mention I am a girl as well which may explain why she was apprehensive of me going to the bar alone with a guy."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2pfq4	2019-06-20 01:06:46	Notouching1244	AITA If I’m really mad at my gf for going through my phone?	"My gf and I recently went on a trip for a week We’ve both been really busy with work so this trip was a good way to reconnect. We had an enjoyable couple of days, before I was woken up one day and asked why I didn’t tell her that I went away on a work trip a week ago. She had gone through my phone looking at the pictures we had taken and saw the other pictures of the sights from the previous week. 

I told her that since we’ve been fighting so much about my work lately and it was a last minute trip, I didn’t want to deal with the fight that we would have. My intention was always to talk about it on this trip where we had some uninterrupted time together to hash our relationship out. She asked me some very pointed questions but I didn’t think too much into it, just was happy we were finally on the same page again. 

Later that night, I went to look at my phone. It was open to some old texts between me and my brother. I usually don’t look at old texts and it had been a while since we texted. That’s when I realized she looked through my texts to find out how I was feeling and to ask the pointed questions. I know I’m kind of TA for not telling her I went away for work, but her reading my texts and going straight for the ones with my brother means she knowingly snooped. She knows my brother and I are super close and talk about everything and if anything were wrong he and I would’ve talked about this. He lives in another country but we keep in touch through texting and phone calls."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2pe5r	2019-06-20 01:02:51	thosecacti	AITA for trying to play devils advocate and show my dad the other side?	"TL:DR at the bottom 

My family is fucked up. My dad hadn’t talked to my aunt, his sister, in almost a year due to an unrelated issue. 

My uncle was diagnosed with cancer awhile back. During this time my aunt took time off work to care for him and also my uncles mother. My uncles mother recently passed away and both me and my mom forced my dad to go to her wake. At the wake I saw my aunt for the first time since my dad last talked to her months ago. She looked like shit. 

We came home from the wake and told my dad that she looked really sick and that something was really wrong. He said “didn’t look at her much” since he only said 2 words to her. 

2 days after the wake my aunt was diagnosed with cancer. My dad has since reached out and is now talking to my aunt and has mended their relationship. 

My dad has no control over his emotions and is extremely polar when it comes to people. He either likes them or hates them, and when he hates them he gets filled with rage to the point where it consumes him. This being said, my dad has decided my aunt getting cancer can be blamed on the fact that she was taking care of my uncle and she let it fester. 

This doesn’t fly for me. He’s said it quite a few times now and I’ve let it slide but it’s getting to the point where he’s enraged by it. Everyone has their way to cope, and maybe getting mad is his, but I am not going to sit idly by and let my dad slander a man who has cancer currently. 

So that brings us to tonight. My dad made yet another comment about how my uncle has made my aunts cancer 1000x worse due to her ignoring the signs and I gently tried to tell him the other side. 

Dad: “she went out to a bar with one of her friends the first week of the month. The next week she was ‘having back pains and too weak’ to go out to dinner with her friend. Clearly her cancer was extremely aggressive to the point where she was laying around idly by letting herself get more and more sick. And he didn’t do anything to help because she had to take care of him [cue tangent about my uncle]” 

Me: “yeah but I don’t think it was this huge drop off. I’m sure her pain came in waves. And who knows maybe it was a combination of pain/fatigue and not wanting to go. We don’t know how she felt” 

That’s just a sample of the conversation considering we went in circles after that. A huge fight ensued. The fight ended with my dad telling me “if I don’t learn how to listen to people and shut the fuck up I will never make it in the corporate world”. 

Once my dad left the room my mom told me I shouldn’t talk to my dad about this anymore as emotions are too high. 

TL:DR my aunt and uncle both have cancer. My dad blames my uncle requiring my aunts assistance/care being the reason her cancer is so bad. I tried to explain to my dad that that might not be the case. A fight ensued.

My boyfriend though is not thrilled. He doesnt mind me writing on the mirror, but its just a string of letters that makes no sense without a cypher. He treats it like I'm keeping a secret from him and seems to be really upset that I'm changing the letters just to keep him out of it.

To me is just feels like I'm exposing my vulnerability and what if the thing that I feel grateful for that day is something thats embarrassing for me?

I got annoyed myself and said he just a kid that need GUIDANCE not yelling and insulting, I also told him if he didn't like my brother then he could just leave the house.

c2p9wk	2019-06-20 00:51:41		AITA for telling my cousins my (our) family dynamic?	"Here's hoping nobody I know is on this sub. 

So, My (23F) parents married young and separated when I was young, and finally got the divorce proceedings finished by the time I was around 8 or 9. My dad remarried and has three more kids now. My Dad's brother's kids, i.e. my cousins (6F, 10M) said some things referring to the three as my cousins as they are theirs, and I absentmindedly corrected them and said ""You mean my siblings.""

A few days later when I visited their house again, they asked me how my dad was my dad but my step mum wasn't ""my mum"". I told them my parents didn't love each other and decided to separate, and then my dad found my step mum and they loved each other and got married, that's why my siblings and I share dads but not mums exactly. They seemed to get it, but I figured they were still curious about things.
(Divorce and remarriage isn't very common this side of the world I doubt they've seen this situation before) 

Now their father, my uncle, is upset with me and  told me that I shouldn't have said anything to them. He says they're too young to understand  and that I should have come to him before saying anything, especially for the younger one. I haven't been there to visit since then because I can't quite face him and I know they'll ask more questions.

I love my cousins and family to death but now I'm not sure about what I did or said, and if I should have waited until they were older or worded it better... moreover since one of them is so young.

c2p8vo	2019-06-20 00:48:50		AITA for being upset with my friend for acting completely different when I rejected him	"For context, my friend \[21M\] (let's call him Jay) and I \[20F\] have known each other since freshman year. Back then he was one of my closest friend's (let's call her Ashley) boyfriend. They broke up at the end of freshman year. My friend and I ended up taking a lot of the same classes our first semester sophomore year and as a result spent a lot of time together. I hadn't made many friends in university so I was absolutely happy that  I was making a close friend. We shared a lot of hobbies in common, had a similar sense of humor and got along pretty well. Somewhere in the midst of this he developed feelings for me. He admitted his feelings for me and I told him I couldn't date him. Jay and Ashley still have a really weird friends with benefits situation. They basically seem like they're still dating but aren't and I didn't want to deal the sort of mess that comes from dating a friend's ex. She was also jealous of the relationship I had with Jay. Things were awkward for a week but I tried my very best to try and make things go back to normal. He would barely talk to me anymore. He wouldn't sit next to me in class. He would show up late for study sessions we planned together late or would never follow through with me suggesting to study together. I think the one incident that hurt me the most was when he made a rude snappy comeback at me. It was the morning of a test that we both had and I was about to head out of my apartment to go take it. Jay was in my living room because he had been studying there all night. As I was heading out he asked me if I  was planning on waiting for him and I said I don't think so. He said in a really angry tone ""well it's common curtsy to wait for people"". And so I waited for him to pack his bag and put on his shoes even though we had a past agreement to not wait for each other on days that we had tests (I like to get to class early and he usually runs late). 

I think the feeling the I felt the most throughout this was hurt. I couldn't figure out if all of Jay's niceness towards me was just because he wanted to date me or if he ever even genuinely considered me as a friend. I understand him putting distance between us but I didn't get why he started treating me so differently. Are his actions justified because I rejected him? Now I try my best to keep distance from him because of how he makes me feel. I just want to say this isn't a validation post because I genuinely can't figure out if the complete change in the way he treated me is justified or not. Recently, I started acting a lot more short and rude towards him too and I can't tell if that's asshole-like behavior."		1	0

I took my dog over to my Mom's house, where my adult older brother also lives, and asked them if they could watch my dog that night since I had to work a night shift and they seem to love my dog. They said yes, and I was grateful for that. 

Go to pick up said dog from Mom's house and when I walk through the door, my brother immediately starts bombarding me with, ""you should really consider letting me keep him. You don't have the time to take care of him and neglect him, he really should be with someone else.""

I responded, ""no, he's my dog and I do too take care of him."" I literally revolve my whole life around this animal. They all know this, they all see this. My dog is worth more to me than anything else in my life and I absolutely do not neglect him. 

My Mom walks in and says, ""you do not take care of that dog, you don't deserve him."" I'm flabbergasted at what is going on and have no idea where this is all coming from. You want to know why I don't take care of my dog?

Her exact words: ""I brushed him yesterday and a whole bunch of hair came off! You don't brush him!"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I absolutely do brush my dog and couldn't believe my Mom and brothers ignorance. 

Listen, my dog is a Golden Retriever. He sheds hair. A lot of it. Constantly. He needs a brush everyday, that's just how it is. And guess what? A lot of hair comes off when you brush him. 

I tried explaining this to my Mom and brother in a delicate way, ""he's a double coated dog, he has a lot of hair"" that nonsense. He doesn't have a single mat in his hair. They are mad at me because a lot of hair came off him. I walked up to my dog and said ""watch, you guys just brushed him yesterday and look at what happens"". I ran my fingers through his coat and a good sized clump stuck to my hand. My Mom just rolled her eyes. 

My entire family is jumping on the bandwagon of ""force [me] to get rid of my dog"". The thought of losing my dog makes tears instantly go to my eyes. I feel like I'm surrounded by idiots and can not have anything good in my life. Whatever my life touches, they ruin. I have a creeping suspicious this is just because they don't want to spend money on a puppy or spend a year training it. My brother was looking for a puppy a week ago and now all of a sudden my dog is in a bad home and he and my Mom would be a good home for him.

In addition to the illegal smuggling of alcohol they were loud, obnoxious, VERY disrespectful to the strippers, I frequently heard them making misogynistic comments away from the stage and talking about wanting to fuck them. I was pretty disgusted. 

Anyway at one point I was in the men's room myself. So I decided I would get back at them on some level...so I grabbed the beer bottles and pissed in places other than the urinal.

It was rush hour and we were all driving home. This one person was in the far left fast lane and going on cruise control. Now they weren't necessarily going slow, but they had like 10 car lengths open road ahead of them and so many cars behind them I stopped counting, and since their speed was stable it was clear they were on cruise control. Now normally I'd be able to just let it go as I wasn't personally behind this person and it didn't effect me, but the number of faster cars behind this one car was so many I told myself ""oh c'mon!"". 

I went in the fast lane, deliberately slowed down, which then pressured that person on cruise control to stop being on cruise and switch lanes. I then sped up and continued on my way, giving all those car lengths of empty space to all the people behind this one person to catch up and go the faster speed they wanted to go. 

And since this was around rush hour, the other lanes had enough cars that they couldn't even drive around this one cruise control person in the fast lane. Idk, what would you have done? Normally I see selfish behavior on the road I let it go, but the amount of cars behind this one person in a row while this person has a solid amount of open road before the next car just felt too much uncalled for."

c2p3uu	2019-06-20 00:35:36	throwaway1523536	AITA for ending a friendship over cheating?	"I will try to make this as short as possible. 

It’s currently exam season and a friend of mine has told me that he plans on cheating on the final in the class we have together. 

Usually, I wouldn’t care about cheating on exams or tests as long as it’s done in a mandatory course. That way, students who don’t want to pursue the class any further than they have to, don’t have to and are able to get decent grades at the same time. However, this is  not the case. 

The class that my friend and I have together is a very specific class in the way that it is an elective course, meaning it isn’t required in order to graduate. With that said, it is assumed that if you are taking the class, you are somewhat serious about it and actually show an interest in being there. 

My friendship with this person has been falling apart for a little while now, but we have managed to keep it going anyway as it seems harsh not to as we were pretty tight. 

I need a high grade in this class in order to pursue it as far as post secondary goes, and he insists that instead of studying, he’s just going to cheat tomorrow and will most likely get a higher grade than I will. 

I mentioned to this friend that I just don’t care enough to continue anymore and that I lose a lot of respect for people who cheat in the way that he is, and he completely ignored it and told me that he still plans to anyway.

Like I said, this friendship has been bumpy for a little while now and this is simply the straw that broke the camels back. 

My other friend says that I am overreacting, although I think I’m being totally fair. I’m sorry if this seems really minor.

I can't prove they had anything physical, but I seen the pornograpic pictures and videos she sent him for over a year, after denying when accused numerous time that anything was going on with anyone, metionally or physically. I've also seen conversations where they planned on meeting up then cancelling. She went as far as convincing me I was paranoid and needed to start my antidepressants again and go to therapy. 

My point is, I have no doubt that my ex partner isn't telling her family, friends and people she knows the full story. I imagine she has just been telling people that we've had a hard few years and we couldn't keep this relationship going.

At some stage in the future, maybe not for years, I'm going to be asked by people, maybe even her family what exactly happened.

"My husband travels out of state for work weekly or biweekly for 3-5 day stretches.  We text daily and he will occasionally call for 10-15 minute long calls, usually while he’s grocery shopping or on his way someplace else.  I’ve asked him over the years to call me every other day or twice a week just so we can talk and hear each other’s voices, and he usually agrees but as I said it doesn’t work out that way.  Sometimes he’ll call for a couple minutes, give a reason he has to go and will tell me he’ll call me back, but doesn’t. The worst was when he did that on my birthday. 

We have been struggling lately and I’m dealing with mental health issues so I’m extra sensitive lately.  Yesterday he told me he’d call me but he ended up staying out with coworkers, and then today he said he’d call me before he went out to dinner with coworkers. An hour after he said that, I suspected he forgot again and texted to ask what time his dinner was. He called in response, but sounded hurried and when I asked if it would be easier to call me after dinner, he said okay, he’d call in a couple hours.  That hardly ever happens (see yesterday) so I said look, if you don’t have time to call me then just tell me so I’m not waiting. He said he didn’t really know what the plan was with his coworkers so he’d just text me later.  I said that’s fine, it’s just I thought he was going to call before he left (as in, not when I reminded him to do it by asking what time his dinner was).

It makes me feel like I’m not worth talking to (or that he doesn’t want to talk to me at all) when he does this. He can talk for hours to anyone else, it seems.  AITA for getting upset  (privately)  
over this?  As I said I’m uber sensitive/vulnerable right now so I’m genuinely not sure.

EDIT - I should add that he called out of the blue two days ago which was nice, and we had a good 10-15 min convo. Maybe he felt like that was enough? He’s trying a little more than he used to but....then there’s days like today and I don’t know whether I’m being a psycho by crying over it or what

EDIT 2 -  He never called or texted. I could see he was online but then got off as soon as I texted at 1:30 AM (I fell asleep waiting for the usual goodnight text).  I don’t know what I did but damn this sucks."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We do Habachi grills for dinner from time to time and knowing that she doesn't like wasabi I always joke and call it avocado and she never eats it. The very first time she saw me using wasabi I explained what it was and she did a micro-taste, after that she has always just laughed it off.

Part of why this is funny is because if I get a salad or anything with avocado I get it on the side and give it to her because it's one of her favorites. Note that this is NEVER the case at a Habachi grill.

So tonight we're out for Habachi again and after I'm done putting the wasabi in my soy sauce I jokingly ask ""Do you want my avocado?"" and get the expected ""No"" respinse.

I finish my California roll and jokingly place the wasabi on her plate...

Much to my surprise she took her fork and scooped about half of it into her mouth!

It seemed like minutes passed as I watched in slow motion the reaction move across her face until she spit it out.

Everyone at the table and many of the staff saw this and couldn't help but laugh. There were a few jokes about it during the dinner, even the chef made a wasabi comment.

I committed to this project months ago when I was more bored than I am now. Once it came around I was dealing with a lot of bad personal stuff, with the project being the last thing I wanted to do. One of the  side effects of the bad personal stuff is that I’m living between multiple different places right now. 

So time for the project comes around and because of personal stuff it became too late to drop. But whatever, right? It’ll take my mind off the bad stuff and I don’t want to screw anyone over by dropping out. 

The head of the project (Sam)  is super young and super inexperienced  to run this project. They constantly blame problems on everyone else and throws their parents money around. These past few days of being a part of it have been weird but doable. 

But then I found out that Sam went on local radio to talk about their project. During this interview Sam mentioned my confusing living situation and they said I’m difficult to plan around because of it. (To be clear we hadn’t even started the project at this point and I had not given any conflicts at all.) this annoyance with my living situation is now immortalized online without my permission and if found by future employers could possibly hurt my career.

The rule for the building is that you have to be 20ft away from the building to smoke. I have no problem with this because I've always been an outside smoker who is considerate and tries to keep my distance.

We have 4 smoking ""posts"" which are designated places with an ash tray - smoking receptacle kind of thing. 3 of them are in the front or side of the building, and the one I use is in the back.

I have been using the one in the back for 3 years. It's about 75-100 ft from the building, because we have a big backyard. The front ones are maybe 25 feet away at best.

The other day I went to take a smoke at 7am. I usually walk further than the smoking area away so I'm at least a clean 100 ft from the building. The backyard ends with a river so my smoke is not hurting neighbors.

On this day, the wind was whipping towards the building. Someone in the building (don't know which apt it came from) yelled "" STOP F*ING SMOKING JESUS CHRIST"".

A minute later ""JEEEEEESUS STOP ALREADY IT'S KILLING ME"" Probably so loud that it woke people in the building up.

"Alright preface, this person who we will call B is one of my best friends and we have a small group of friends(were all in our mid/early twenties), her little brother J got his 15 year old girlfriend A pregnant and they have a 1 year old baby girl. Obviously it wasn’t ideal or planned but both their families were super supportive. We all went to the baby shower, J and A have their own apartment and everyone helps in little ways. Honestly I don’t think they’ve really struggled because everyone is always ready to help. However, A hasn’t finished high school and J works for his dad and makes okay money. The behind the scenes family stuff is obviously closed off to me but they always seem to have it together.

Well,  three days ago A posted something and I sent it into our friends group chat, it’s only the girls in our friends group and were all BF’s. I said “Wait is A pregnant” to which B replied “yeaaahhhhh” and I replied with “OMG THATS SO BITTER SWEET. ITS A BABY SO YAY BUT THEYRE SO YOUNG.” 

At this point B went off and me and told me J and A didn’t need to hear that and that I needed to be supporting and not judge. Even though I didn’t say it to them only to her and our circle. 

It kind of bugs me because I feel like they haven’t gotten a taste of reality. I’m not saying life should be tough for them but everyone is always at their disposal so now they’re 16 and 18 with two kids and A hasn’t even graduated from HS. This is such a phenomenon in our community and I have seen the devastating effects that I can have so obviously I always hope for a better for my friends and their siblings.

c2p147	2019-06-20 00:28:21		AITA for possibly calling my lifelong friend transphobic	"I’m a 23 y/o male and my best friend is a 23 y/o female who married in May. We met in fourth grade,  been friends for ~15 years. She is an amazing person who I love very much, but our friendship is essentially ruined because of what went down before her wedding day. 

Our other close friend, who I lived with at the time, is a trans man. Him and I are very close, and a year ago, in the midst of the wedding being planned, we were asked to be a part of the party. Bride-to-be also asked our friend to wear a dress, that she had conveniently already purchased for him. This was at the beginning of his transition and he was experiencing a lot of gender dysphoria at the time, telling me that he felt like a “prop in a show” wearing a dress and make-up. He said that he wanted to be her bridesmaid and that entailed wearing a dress, so he didn’t mind sucking it up for just one day. 

A few days before her wedding, we went shopping for some last minute items with our married best friend D. Everything was fine, although complaints started to drive me crazy towards the end of the day, and I mentioned everyone involved in the wedding has a life and things they need to do so the wedding isn’t a top priority for everyone, but D explained that I don’t know what it’s like to be a bride and that it’s one of the most stressful events of a person’s life.  I said “well then I’ll probably do things differently,” in a condescending tone. When they asked what I meant, I spewed out “I probably wouldn’t make a guy wear a dress, for starters”. As we walked out of the mall, she asked “do you think I’m transphobic” to which I replied “well....”. She stormed off to her car and immediately called up our friend to tell him that I just “tore her apart for being transphobic” even though we had a two minute conversation that ended in her leaving mid sentence. She then told our friend that if he didn’t want to wear the dress, he could be replaced by another friend who wears the same size. He rejected this offer but thanked me for standing up for him and we agreed to just get through the wedding together. 

I then hear that Bride-to-be’s husband is furious and wants to “give me a talking to”. Bride to be is ignoring me, so I give him a call and he starts to talk to me like I’m an idiot per-usual. Tells me I can “sit down and be quiet or not show up at all.” Along with “just so you know, your friend is married to me now, so I know everything that goes on and I’m a part of this and yadaya”

I decide to go and be there for my friend. She later explained that her dad is the reason she made him wear a dress along with the fact that “he was still transitioning, it wasn’t like he was a guy for years,” and that the way I spoke to her is a problem because she “has an issue with being spoken down to by angry men”. On her wedding day, it was all fake smiles, acting like it never happened. Not a word since."		1	0

Tonight we had a full bag so I asked him to take it out. He slid on his slippers and I asked him to wear a pair of rubber sandals instead. He asked why and I told him because I didn’t want to have to keep washing his slippers because he’s wearing them outside. He immediately got pissed off; he kicked them off, and went to the bedroom without a word and put on his sneakers. He grabbed the trash and slammed the door really hard behind him. He hasn’t said a word to me since he came back in. 

I don’t understand why he’s so mad (considering he won’t talk to me). I have asked him not to wear his slippers outside before and explained the exact reason and he said “just don’t wash them then”, but they get leaves and mud on them and then he tracks it through the place which then means more sweeping and mopping for me (as I’m a bit of a neat-freak, which he knows full well. I’m constantly cleaning); that’s not to say stuff doesn’t get stuck on sneakers, but with them you can just wipe them off, which you can’t do so fabric slippers. He’s a good husband but he doesn’t tend to think about how he creates more work for me sometimes. I thought I was just reminding him of what I’ve asked before but apparently not.

c2ozl2	2019-06-20 00:24:09	misskarne	AITA If I override my father's wishes about my mother's organ donation even if they contradict hers?	"So I (31F) am the oldest child of my parents. Last year my best friend's father died of cancer, so I've since been bugging my dad (58M) and mum (56F) to make a will and get things sorted because I saw the shitfight that went down in my friend's family even though her father *did* have a will. For context, both my parents have had serious health issues, some quite recently. They've both just retired (medically) and they own their house outright plus a caravan, so there are assets to think of. Last week they finally went and did it.

So I was asking them questions about arrangements, and it got onto the serious stuff - end of life care, do-not-resuscitate and all that kind of stuff, and we finally got to organ donation. I've always been upfront with both my parents about my wishes (that I want my organs donated), but we'd never had a serious conversation about my parents.

Mum goes first and says they can have everything but her eyes - she has a weird hang-up about eyes. Dad goes next and says no, which is fine. But then he says to me - if I'm still alive but not there for some reason and you have to make the call for your mother, I want you to say no.

We both give him weird looks and I remind him that mum said yes. Dad still says he would say no and he would want me to say no. He says that the people who take organs are butchers and that he wants my mother by his side in one piece (which is not only mildly creepy-possessive but also extra weird since we'd just agreed he wanted to be cremated).

I told him in no uncertain terms that if it fell to me to make the call I am going with mum's wishes. I get a look of utter betrayal and some mumbling about his wishes.

AITA? I've always felt really strongly about organ donation and how wrong it is that families can override the patient's wishes. I'm also strongly ""my body my choice"". None of this should have been a surprise to dad, but I feel like somehow I hurt his feelings about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

We're sitting at a table for 4 where one side is a bench against a wall and the other side is two chairs.  We opt to both sit on the bench side (ya whatever I know).  Our waiter is this man in his mid twenties (our age as well) and throughout the course of the meal, whenever he comes over, he sits in the chair opposite my SO and talks basically directly to her.  He looks at her with RAPT attention (I have been a waiter and I absolutely never looked at anyone like that) and when he comes back to check on us he only asks her how her meal is and not me.  He would make eye contact only with her, and look directly at her, and basically ignore the fact that I was there.  The way that he looked at/talked to her IMO was not professional.  And this was the case every time he came over, from taking our order to bringing the check.  It felt like a really strange power play and made me feel confused and upset.  

&#x200B;

So.... should or could I have done something?  I guess the normal course of action was to ask my SO if she felt this was weird...but I was feeling so put off that I didn't bring it up and then tried to just pretend it didn't happen.  FYI this had never happened before and has never happened after."	Asshole	1	0

c2oyh6	2019-06-20 00:21:13	cluelesslyawkward	AITA for not taking an acquaintance’s advice?	"Throwaway account just to be safe. My first post was too long —

I’m an intern currently at a clinic, and I’ve almost been at this place for a year but I have another year before I completely finish my program. Two people there particularly like me, we’ll say Larry and Tom. Both are people I came to look up to, and essentially began following around to truly learn tips and tricks of the trade. Larry is one of the instructors, he’s become a father figure and is my mentor while I’m in the program. He’s done a lot for me, to the point he’s helped me get a job at the clinic which he rarely ever does because he sees “potential” in me that I joke about never having at times. We have a mentor/mentee relationship at this point (other interns have this with other instructors). Tom was someone that works at the clinic but joined while I was interning, and has always acted like a big brother and made sure to watch out for me as well. Tom was someone I confided in more or less because he’s a tad bit younger than Larry and understands the younger generation people (I’m a ripe 26 year old, these two are at least 10/40 years older).

Larry invites me along with a few classmates to do a rare opportunity thing (can’t go into too much detail due to HIPPA), but he knows that most likely I’m the only one that’s willing to go on a weekend, as interns in the past don’t normally participate. An incident occurs, and I help out to ease everything for everyone working that day, but a couple people complain about it. I was initially hurt, but I end up letting the situation go. I should note here Tom was never present at the situation.

I was sick for a bit, and Tom briefly mentions that incident and how he doesn’t understand why Larry would even invite me if he never wanted me there and would complain about me being there. I’m shocked, hurt by the thought, and ask where he gets that information from. Tom says he got it from Olivia, another worker, and someone I also occasionally chat with. Olivia wonders why Tom says any of it, as parts of it weren’t true, and there’s a miscommunication issue, and it wasn’t anything about me in the first place. Tom says to just let this situation go and not let this ruin my mentor/mentee relationship and that he’ll always be there as a bro no matter what. I decide to talk to Larry anyway. 

Larry’s upset that anyone would think he would say anything to hurt me, and I tear up because I’m glad none of it is true. We both agree is just miscommunication. Tom is now pissed because I didn’t listen to him and that I betrayed his trust — now he wants absolutely nothing to do with me and just wants to be civil as I “picked Larry over him.” I try to explain I never meant to do anything like that and my past experiences where the best thing to do was to rectify the situation was just talk it out, but he’s mad I didn’t let it go and didn’t talk to him before talking to Larry.

c2oyc4	2019-06-20 00:20:50	terfgsmm	AITA for being upset that my son didn’t tell me he is gay?	"I have a 19 year old son, Jack. I had him very young. Me and his mom married at 20. 

I was an alcoholic when Jack was growing up and when he was eight, I had an affair with another woman and had another son “Daren”. Me and Jack’s mom got a divorce. 

This kind of forced me to sober up and I’ve been sober 11 years now. I moved about six hours away to raise Daren and I married Daren’s mother. 

Me and Jack’s mom aren’t on the best of terms and I saw Jack a few times a year, although I would always send him money. 

I was up to visit Jack’s uncle (we’ve always been buddies) and he asked me how Jack’s boyfriend was doing. I asked him what he meant and he just repeated that he saw some pictures of Jack and his boyfriend and he was wondering how they were doing. 

I mumbled some excuse that they were fine and left shortly after. As soon as I got in my car I called Jack. I told him what his uncle told me and I was pretty upset that he thought he couldn’t confide in me. 

Jack started to cry and basically started ranting about how I “abandoned” him and his Mom when he was young and how I’ve “always preferred Daren” to him and that’s why he didn’t tell me because he feels like he doesn’t matter to me. 

I tried to explain myself and I said that I understand that I’ve been a shitty father sometimes but I love him and I don’t care that he’s gay. 

He told me that he didn’t know if he was ever going to tell me because I’m an “asshole” and I have no right to get upset about not knowing something about him after I abandoned him so long ago. He then hung up on me. 

I haven’t told my wife or Daren what’s happened and I don’t want to until I work through all this and gain some perspectives on what happened.

c2oyaz	2019-06-20 00:20:47	khaila_	AITA for getting upset with my dad for breaking a promise?	"I graduated high school three years ago. Months before I graduated, my dad said to me that if I didn’t go away for school, he’d buy me a car. I wasn’t planning on going to a different state anyway, so whatever. I didn’t mention anything about this till a little after I got my license. I got my license earlier last year (in January). 

Last summer, I asked him about it and he said he’d go half with me (which I was WILLING to do) but he changed his mind. Whatever. I asked him again recently and now he wants me to pay for it on my own, knowing that I don’t make a lot of money at the job that I have. 

We recently applied for a program that would hopefully grant me free tuition. Now he’s saying that until I’m awarded the free tuition (which is NOT guaranteed), that he’s not buying me a car. Which is unfair, since I have to take a bus & two trains to work and school. I’m spending a shit load of money on public transport per month and I feel like that money should be going towards a car!

My mom isn’t getting involved because she’s aware that he made this promise, she agrees that I need a car, and she wants my dad to actually stick to something for once. 

TL;DR: my dad broke his promise about getting me a car if I stayed home for school; desperately need a car at this point due to far school + job, he still won’t budge. 

EDIT: my dad has NEVER kept a solid promise to me.

EDIT2: my dad loves to brag to others about how well I drive! (whenever I would drive his/my mom’s car down the street or something like that)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I told my boss I can do any day this season and we went through the schedule and I ok’d it. Here’s the thing: we work too much overtime, late nights, sometimes 6/7/8 days in a row, and it’s hard. I am pretty unhappy on busy days because people expect me to do everything and they take advantage of me and take my kindness for weakness, and some are pretty shitty occasionally. I’d feel bad for telling my boss I can’t do those busy days anymore, but I’ve put in so much time in general for so long here and I’m so unhappy with how some treat me. The positives haven’t been outweighing the negatives recently. Would I be the asshole for pulling out of the busy days for pursuing a passion and other work, even though I already told him months ago I could do it? I just need some opinions.

c2ox8a	2019-06-20 00:17:54	childfreevasectomy	AITA for making my husband get a vasectomy?	"My husband and I have been together for almost two decades. Both of us are 100% that we don't want children. We made a deal in our early 20s that when I turned 35 I'd get off birth control and he'd get a vasectomy.

I had two reasons for making this deal with him:

(1) We're both smokers and being on birth control after 35 increases the risk of health issues for women. In addition, I am terrible at remembering to take pills at the same time every day. I got an IUD in my mid 20s but that caused some issues. I switched to the depo shot but long term use can increase the risk of osteoporosis, which my grandmothers on both sides suffer from. Because of these issues, I was looking forward to stopping birth control at 35 after almost ten years on the depo shot and being on hormonal BC from the time I was 14.

(2) We have an open relationship. While neither of us want children, if he got a woman pregnant, we couldn't abandon the kid. I'm the primary breadwinner (I make at least 90% of our money). Legally we could work it out so only his income would count in calculating child support, but morally we would have to give the kid a comfortable life and a portion his income would not cut it. I didn’t want to risk being on the hook supporting another woman’s child. I also don’t want to have to fulfill a parenting role for a child, which would be inevitable because we wouldn’t want a kid to grow up with one parent not in their life. If the hypothetical kid is in my husband’s life, it’s in mine. We live in an area where abortion is legal but not common. You have to jump on a plane to get to a doctor who will perform one. Most women here choose to have a baby over abortion. Also, most women are not on birth control.

35 came and went and my husband didn't make the appointment. At 36, I started pressuring him to get a vasectomy. No ultimatums, but I pushed hard for him to make an appointment and get it done. At one point I even made a threat to go off birth control and if he wanted to fuck me he'd have to wear condoms.  I brought it up frequently and I can be very persuasive. He would say he didn’t want to do it because he didn’t want a knife near his balls. One of his brothers and his father had a vasectomy and they essentially said he was being a baby about it and it wasn’t that bad.

After my nagging, he eventually had it done. Now, he will make comments when he’s upset about something else such as “you made me get a vasectomy, I didn’t want one.” He’ll also make comments like “I want to get her pregnant, oh wait, I can’t, you made me get a vasectomy.” These ones are usually in jest. However, I know that he resent that he had it done.

Part of my job is to consult with other attorneys in my office and political offices to help guide policy decision making. I’m the youngest person  part of this task group but I do the lion’s share of the work. 

All of the women on the task group manage to call me by my name, as do the men who are closer to my age. But most of the task force is comprised of middle-aged men, and not a single one of them  uses my name and instead they all call me “young lady.” And it’s not that they forget my name, I have introduced myself every time we meet as a hint to stop using “young lady” and my email signature uses my name. This has been going on for months. Today, I finally had enough of the “young lady” stuff.

I was introduced to a very prominent local leader today as “the young lady who works hard for us,” and then I somewhat aggressively introduced myself with my name. I spent the rest of the meeting being upset and I stayed pretty quiet. I guess the men noticed and asked me what was wrong after the meeting. I was very upfront and told them how I don’t like it when they call me “young lady,” how it makes me feel disrespected, and that I want to be called my name. They accused me of being too sensitive, and I got rather heated and said I shouldn’t have to ask to be called by my actual name in a professional setting. They told me to watch how I talk to my superiors because “we have been practicing law longer than you’ve been alive” and have subsequently disinvited me to the rest of the meetings with the local leader.

c2oupr	2019-06-20 00:11:43		AITA For Not Wanting To Pay For My Cat’s Shots?	"We adopted a cat back in September. He’s a great cat and we really love him, but from day 1, he’s attacked our older female cat. He’s bigger than her and he jumps on her back and bites her neck, causing her to scream and he keeps going after her until she escapes and hides.

We gave it some time, hoping they would get used to each other but it didn’t help. We’ve tried countless methods we’ve seen online, tried methods our vet gave us, and even tried essential oil/pheromone sprays/diffusers; no improvement. We decided that it was not fair for our other cat to live her life in hiding, getting attacked every time she goes to eat or use the litter box, and it was best if we tried finding another home for the other cat.

We adopted him from a rescue and per our adoption contract, we must return him to the rescue if we decide to re-home him. I called the contact from the rescue and he said “If it’s been over a year since his rabies/distemper shot, you’ll need to get that done as we can’t accept a cat unless it’s up to date on shots.” Fair enough. I checked the records and saw he was vaccinated on 7/5/18. I texted the guy and let him know and he said “You May want to go ahead and get him his shots since it’s so close.” Here is where my issues begin.

We are in the process of moving and have a ton going on. Between preparing for our move and our jobs, I don’t know if I’ll have the time to get the cat to the vet as we need to drop him off early next week. I told him this and he said “Well if you can’t get him seen, just bring the money when you drop him off and we’ll take care of it.” This is where I started getting mad.

We wanted to find a new home/family for him as opposed to going back to a shelter/rescue, but we’re bound by a contract to return him to the rescue. I said, “Not to sound callous, but you’ll be taking possession of him 3 weeks before he’s due for shots. I’m not sure how I’m financially responsible.” He said, “Well you’ve had him almost a year and you should have planned to do this when you weren’t so busy.” I explained that this wasn’t an easy or quick decision and didn’t know before today that we’d be bringing him back.

It’s $24 which is nothing, and I’m going to give the guy the money, but I just find it very rude and unprofessional and obviously he’s more concerned with the money than anything else."	Asshole	1	0

There is one men’s bathroom on my floor level that has only 3 toilet stalls and they fill up pretty often. Employees like to escape work and use these stalls as a getaway to play on their phones and burn the clock, and sometimes it seems like people spend 15+ minutes in the stalls to “do their business”. Also for a side note later, the bathroom stall walls don’t touch the ground completely, so you can see the shoes of red-handed people using the restroom.

Whenever I need to use the restroom, there is usually a 50% chance all the stalls will be filled up on my floor. It gets pretty frustrating and I have to resort to taking the stairs down to the bottom level to go to the bathroom (if there are stalls open hopefully).

Today I needed to go to the restroom and went to the bathroom to see no stalls available to use. I did take note of the lime green sketchers visible from the nearest stall and left to go back to work and wait. I waited maybe 15-20 minutes and returned to the bathroom to see the same lime green sketchers under the bathroom stall, did my business, washed my hands, and eyed the lime green sketchers still there plus the faint sound of button clicks coming from that stall.

As I was leaving, I wadded up a golfball-size wet paper towel and lobbed a nice hook shot into the stall. I’m pretty sure it was a headshot lol. As I was walking away and exiting the bathroom like a fade-away shooter, a shrieking “what the heck!!” followed in the distance. I don’t really feel much remorse for what I did.

"Me and my GF are both 18, studying in US as int'l college students. I am broke with student debts but she is not (family rich).

Now during this summer originally we were going to be separated for 4 months because I was going to return to my home country and work for 4 months to save money for my future, and she was going to stay in the US for 2 months to take extra summer courses, and then return to her country for 2 months, until the next school year began. We both didn't like that, and she really hated it, so I decided to stay 2 months longer in the US with her, living together in a room we rent together, and work in the US instead. However, circumstances changed for me, and I found that I could not work back in my home country (complicated reasons). So the 2 months in US became the only time I could earn money. I worked my ass off while staying very frugal (havent bought anything for myself except groceries and occasional cheap snacks during the recent 2 months).

And here come the problem. I'm leaving here, back to my country soon, and we will be separated for two months. Before I decided to stay in the US a bit longer, I had told her that I will come visit her country in the summer so we won't be separated for so long. However, the trip will cosy about at least 600USD, and because she is often extravagant, for a three nights stay I must except over 1000 USD to spend. During the past 2 months I have saved about 4000 USD. Because it's just two months now, I dont want to go and spend so much. She offered me to pay for my hotels and stuff but I said no because I think it's wrong that I should be paid for my stay by the money that her parents earned.

But I have other stuff I want to use my money on. I haven't bought new clothes for a long time and it's pretty pathetic how empty and unfashionable my wardrobe looks. So I want to spend money on clothes and shoes. Solo travel has also been my long time dream, and I want to do it during the summer near my country, staying in hostels, eating cheap foods, walking a lot... like typical uni student stuff (i'm looking at about 200$ for this. A very cheap trip). But I am afraid if it might come across as me willing to spend money on MY stuff instead of for HER, to my GF. But I feel like it's justified since I bought literally nothing during these past few months. I want to use about 600$ altogether during this summer, and add the 3400$ for my savings to pay my student debt etc in the future. But for my GF it appears that the concept of saving up for the future seems foreign to her and I dont know if she could understand. :(

AITA if I told her that I am not coming to visit her country during the summer?

IF I ATA, then I will reconsider and probably visit her.
If NTA, then what should I tell my girlfriend, and should I hide the solo travel to her? Pls help :("	No A-holes here	0	0

They all died from various health-related issues like cancer, heart attack, and stroke. She's 52, so when my uncle died, I was like ... she can't be smoking. I nagged at her for a long time, and she was like yeah yeah but apparently that didn't motivate her. I took a much harsher approach and said that I wouldn't take vacation to come visit this summer (she lives a couple thousand miles away, so I only visit over the summer and Christmas). I told her that back in January, and I don't think she believed me. She kept trying to call my bluff, but I didn't back down. May went by and no ticket was booked, so I think she got worried and she actually quit smoking! She hasn't smoked for the past few weeks. I guess she could be lying, but she's a really honest person so I doubt it. I am really happy and proud of her. Do you really think I'm an asshole for being pushy to force her to quit? Regardless of what y'all think, I know I did the right thing, because she isn't smoking anymore."	Asshole	0	0
c2ooml	2019-06-19 23:55:49	throwawayyy63739	WIBTA if I bought my cousin alcohol without her parents permission	"I'm mid twenties and my cousin is in her teens. She is going to a festival with her friend and her friends parents this weekend. She has asked me to buy her a bottle of alcohol (nothing what I would consider 'hard' liquor) to take with her. I have said no once before about 9 months ago however I have kind of already said yes on this occasion.

My aunt and uncle won't know she will be drinking. Or at the very least, won't know that I bought her the alcohol that she is drinking. 

So my reasoning for this is many fold: she is just shy of being able to drink legally in some contexts. Her friends parents are fine with it (apparently) and let their child drink (in a healthy respectful way, like a glass of wine with dinner type way). The reason they are not providing is because the friends slightly younger sister is not allowed to drink and they don't think it is fair and/or will cause issues that will ruin the weekend.

On the occasion she asked previously she did end up drinking anyway and got tipsy (I did not tell her parents). Everything was fine.

We have a strong family history of alcoholism and my aunt has already had a very serious talk with her about how to drink responsibly. I have also had a very serious talk with her about it, and she is very aware of how to look after herself, how to pace herself and ensure her safety. The friends parents are also going to be there supervising, and my aunt trusts them enough to take my cousin away for the weekend.

We have a very close relationship, and I am glad she can come to me to ask these things because she trusts me. At her age I think it is important to have one adult that isn't going to judge or rat you out for wanting to rebel a little bit.

I'm just wondering that by giving her the alcohol I'm an asshole because her parents are not in the loop.

Edit: yes IWBTA - I am not going to buy it for her. Thanks for the judgement"	Asshole	0	0

"Ok so basically I’m going to prom with girl X, now this girl is someone who I was getting with in the past but anymore, so she is my date for prom but we’re not going as a couple or strictly as friends. However, Girl X is going to a different after prom, which is annoying as we agreed on going to the one I’m going to for a long time.

Now girl Y comes along. She’s a girl who likes me and is also going to the same after prom as me. She said she wants to “get down” at prom, however i could potentially persuade girl X to go to my prom on the day, thus making her my first choice for any “action” at prom, and making girl Y my second choice. This is because I can’t shag someone who isn’t my date at after prom, as that would make me a dickhead as my date would be there.

So, would making Girl Y my second choice make me the asshole?"		1	0

"This kind of thing happens a lot so I want to finally post today's event here. Backstory time, I just got my learners permit and we went out to get sushi for dinner and my girlfriend came with us to celebrate. After we got done eating she was telling me about how she found a pretzel recipe and wanted me to make them with her. I thought it was fun and said that I'll ask my parents when we got home. After we got home and chilled for about 15 minutes she texted me.

This is where our story begins. She says that she doesn't think that we could do them over at her house but could see about going over to her grandparents house. Her house is about a 15-20 minute walk away from my house but her grandparents house was a 10 minute drive away. After she got conformation that we could do it over at her grandparents house, I went and asked if I could go.

Now in order for me to go I would've needed a ride there and a ride back a couple of hours later. It was 7:00 when I asked and they had their pajamas on. They said that they were tired and that I couldn't go over. When I told my girlfriend this she got mad at me and told me that I ruin everything. Like I said at the top of the post, this kind of thing happens a lot. Later she said that her Aunt could bring me home but my parents still said no and to ""reschedule to for the weekend"". When I told my girlfriend this she said that she wasn't going to reschedule it and was going to do it without me. So reddit here's my question, am I the asshole?"		1	0

c2ols1	2019-06-19 23:48:14	solidunicorn6	AITA for not telling my girlfriends mom something that I dont know myself?	"Few things.
1. Idk about spelling, grammar, the works. Comment if you'd like, I dont care.
2. Yes, I suck at explaining things.
3. Yes I'm on mobile, sorry for the bricks.

So I had told my girlfriends mom all the information she had asked for, and the day of the wedding a few things had changed. My sister was picking us up, and we were going to go all together to save gas, but the day of, my mom changed her plans and went to the hotel her and my stepdad were gonna stay at to make sure everything was ready. So me, my friend, and my little brother were gonna be alone for a bit.

Ok, so my girlfriends mom shows up, and I'm told that they want to talk with me. So, I go over to them and talk and she started saying that this wasn't the plan, and that this was bullshit, and that she would bring my girlfriend back when my sister gets here. (I should mention that she thinks me and my girlfriend are gonna fuck every chance we get. Whether there are people there or not.)i simply told her I didnt know the plans had changed until a few hours before that, and that she could have asked if she wanted to know more. So, I simply say ok, and watch as my girlfriend goes back into the car super pissed off, and I go in and try not to punch a wall. After the anger subsided I played video games with my friend.
Now, she is saying that I make my girlfriend suffer. Which I know isnt true because I am the only person in the house that is willing to help her with anything (while I'm over), while everyone else just sits around and smoke/converse, only working after they have taken a break, while not letting my girlfriend take one, and constantly distracting her. Then saying later that she ""was very distracted, and didnt do it right.""
I haven't talked to my girlfriend in about a week as her mom took her phone and wont say why.

So, yeah. AITA for not telling her about something I hadn't known about?

Edit: the first time I posted this my phone failed and I had flagged words in it (which i tried to resolve by removing them since they weren't crucial to the story) so it didnt post, but I have a reason for why her mom took her phone now. She said that she has my girlfriends phone because she read all our texts to each other, and she didnt like what she saw (we dont have the most PG conversations, sometimes going into the rated r area), so until plans change (whatever that means) the only way I'll be able to talk with my girlfriend is through the house phone, and I have a feeling that if I call, my girlfriend will answer, but someone else is gonna pick up the other line and listen in."

c2oloc	2019-06-19 23:47:58	prettyhoneybee	AITA for not giving a reason for wanting to do something a little later?	"Okay, I think this one is pretty simple. 

Renewing lease with boyfriend(23M), we were previously on the fence but decided to go ahead after I(24F) took the time to negotiate a 3% increase instead of the proposed 5%. Boyfriend was very impressed and happy that I did that. 

He asked me to then call the office yesterday to confirm we would renew. I was at work (nurse) when I negotiated (Monday) and when he asked me to call back (Yesterday). 

Today’s my day off. I just worked 2 12hr shifts and I’m tired, and I had a friend over even though I wasn’t really feeling it, I know we hadn’t seen each other in a long time so I said we could. 

Bf texts me and asks if I can call because there was something that needed to be added to the lease. My phone was in the other room for an hour so he didn’t hear from me. 

I get back to him and see I have 3 missed calls and several texts and I call him back and he expresses annoyance that I was missing. He asks me to call the office to get that change and I tell him I’ll do it in 30 min. He pushes back and says I need to do it now, it’s time sensitive, etc. I say it’s really not, we still had 3.5hr before the office closes and we had already had an email conversation with the guy so it wasn’t like he didn’t already know what my bf wanted me to call about. 

He insists I need to do it right that moment and I say I’ll do it in 30 min. He asks why and I tell him I don’t need to have a reason, I’m just going to do it in 30 min. He gets mad and starts berating me, saying he’s at work and he can’t count on me, and that I’m being unreasonable and I need to do it now. I’m getting annoyed and I just say I’ll do it in 30 min, it’s not a big deal. 

He hangs up on me after saying he’ll do it himself. 

Gets home and he’s angry at me, saying I’m lazy and don’t want to do anything, and that he *checked the camera to see why I wasn’t responding and found I was doing nothing except hanging with my friend* which I thought was super creepy and was disturbed. Then he said since I was so terrible if I ever needed him to do anything he would say it’s not his priority and purposefully wait because I wouldn’t do this exactly when he wanted. 

I asked him why he thought it would be okay to spite me like that and that he doesn’t need to know my motives behind everything all the time and he said he guesses he doesn’t know why he dates me. 

I think he was being super immature and rude and he insists he wasn’t. I was at work when I made those calls and I’m a nurse. My work is pretty important but I was able to make the time, he works in an office and if he didn’t like that I was going to do it in 30, he should have just done it himself. 

AITA here?

Edit: yeah I know I didn’t give him a reason but after 6yrs with this dude, I know if I said anything like “I’m tired and i just want to relax” he would have said some bs like “well it won’t take long so do it and then you can relax right after”

So at this point I felt like there was just no point. I believe I said something like “I just want to do it in half an hour”

Edit 2: apparently his missed calls were him wanting to ask me a question about one of the emails sent by the office and not trying to track me down. 

I still think he was in the wrong overall though."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2okpm	2019-06-19 23:45:23	justfor_AITA	AITA for not forgiving my dad for cheating on my mom?	"This is my first Reddit post. I don't feel comfortable asking my friends about this, but I really need an outsiders opinion to see if I'm overreacting. Tldr at bottom.

&#x200B;

Last year I overheard my dad on the phone with another woman. I don't remember most of what he said, but there was nothing explicit. I only remember that he was asking her to buy underwear and try it on for him. The worst part is that my mom had been away at her parents across the country looking after her mother as she was dying. My grandmother had stopped treatment for her cancer, so my mom had been spending as much time with her as possible. The night this happened my mom was on a flight back home for my sister's graduation.

&#x200B;

The next day the 3 of us drove to my sisters college, and my sister and I confronted dad that night. The first thing he said was ""You shouldn't be listening in on my phone calls."" (he was in the study, door open, I was in the living room). He said it was a ""phone call that went too far"", insisted that nothing ever happened in person, and that one phone call was it. He was sorry that I overheard it and said that he would tell mom that night.

&#x200B;

That was the last time it was ever mentioned. We all pretended everything was ok, and mom flew back to her parents the next day. My grandmother passed 3 weeks later, but since then I avoided dad as much as possible. I was away at college from July-April and didn't see him much, never spoke to him on the phone. When I was home, I just avoided him. I've been talking to him a bit more this summer, but still avoiding him. Both parents have noticed this, mom asked me to be nicer to dad and why I was being so cold to him (I gave no answer). 

&#x200B;

AITA for still being mad at him for over a year? My mom seemed to forgive him straight away, but I think she just couldn't be angry with him at that time. It's more the timing of what he did that bugs me – he did this while my mom was going through hell. I'm also not sure if I believe him when he said that one phone call was it. He was never going to tell mom about it until I brought it up, so if anything else happened he wouldn't say so. It also seems convenient that I overheard the one and only time dad cheated (is this even considered cheating?). 

&#x200B;

I've also realized that I just don't like my dad as a person. Among other things, he won’t take responsibility for anything and blames mom for anything that goes wrong. Mom dismisses it, saying it's because he works so much. But, even as I've been cold to him, he’s still nice and pays for my college tuition, rent, and food.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading this, sorry it’s so long and ranty. So AITA for still being mad at my dad?

&#x200B;

Tldr: I overheard my dad on the phone with another woman a year ago. He said that that one phone call was it, but I’m not so sure. This happened while mom was away at her parents taking care of her dying mother. AITA for still being mad at him?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Today our niece ask if we had any job ideas, so she could buy a phone. She claims that mom is OK with her having a phone. My husband wants to send her our old IPhone 5 thats not being used? 

I dont think its a good idea. #1. I think parents should be responsible for choosing if the kid has a phone, and I dont have verbal or written permission from the parents. Niece was very manipulative even at 11, and Idk if she trying to pull something. #2. Metro PCS gives out free phones with a new plan(she doesn’t need a iPhone, a free phone will do just fine also an iPhone 6 is only $99 with metroPCS). #3. Even though we aren’t using it now, i like knowing we have a backup phone just incase one of ours breaks.

She just told me one day that she was going to go to camping in Colorado with a group of people I’ve never met and when I asked if I could go she replied, “I guess, if you want to. I just didn’t think you’d be interested.”  Then I made some comments about how it was weird how she wanted to go camping with a bunch of single guys who I’ve never met and thus don’t know whether to trust.  She compares it to a bachelor party I went on without her to lake of the Ozarks with 10 of my high school guy friends (all but one were in relationships).

Update:  girlfriend cancelled going after I told her I would go too.  She admitted she didn’t want me to go but says it’s because she wants to develop her own friendships and not be joined at the hip.  She stated that guys and girls can be “just friends,” and that I had nothing to worry about.  I love her and want to trust her but I just don’t quite understand her not wanting me there.

c2oi86	2019-06-19 23:38:55		AITA for feeling cheated by my friends?	So for a week now me and 13 other guys have been planning on playing a tournament of spike ball in a bracket style in which each person brings 5$ to enter and teams of 2 are randomly selected out of a hat. We all agreed that the two winners would split the pot. Unknown to us, during the finals between my team and another team of 2. One of my friends takes the money with him and he says he has to go get food. Turns out my team of 2 wins. We go to collect our winnings, and its gone. Later we find out that all of the losers came together and basically came up with the idea that we will do this again every week, with no additional fees, and whoever wins the most games throughout the following months will split the money. It seems to me that they just want a 'second chance' of winning and don't want to admit the fact that they lost fair and square. I brought up this point in our group chat and it everyone is telling me its no big deal, but its really the principle of changing the rules halfway through without telling the people directly impacted by the rule change that is upsetting me.

c2ofjq	2019-06-19 23:32:17	kanna172014	AITA for being upset because my grandmother implied I was fat?	"This happened several years ago before my father died. As a bit of backstory, his parents DID NOT like my mom. They were upper middle-class while she was considered poor white trash. My father was something of the black sheep in the family, but they still thought he was too good for my mom. They never really treated me and my brother as well as they treated the other grandkids.

Anyway, about a couple of years after my mom died, my grandmother asked my father if we could come and rake her yard and she would cook steaks for dinner. Okay, that seemed like a good deal. We go over and spend HOURS raking her yard. She had a huge yard and there was sand mixed with the leaves everywhere, making them hard to rake and put in a wheelbarrow to be burned in a stack. Making this worse were the fire ant beds in the sand. You can imagine how fun that was. Anyway, we (me, my brother and father) all worked our butts off. Once we were finished, my grandmother asked me to come help her in the kitchen (I was exhausted but I still went) and she had me set the table.

Now for the good part. She ended up serving herself, my brother and my father huge steaks each (they were T-bones) but she gave me a steak that was literally a third the size, maybe the size of a small porkchop. I didn't say a word, I just stared at it in disbelief and she knew exactly what I was thinking because she told me she thought I could stand to lose some weight (mind you that while I was chubby, both my brother and father were both fatter than I was and even my grandmother was quite  portly herself at the time). I was too humiliated and upset to eat and it was all I could do to keep from crying. 

Later after we got home, my father chewed me out for being ungrateful. He didn't stand up for me whatsoever. But after that, I was not inclined to help her out with chores anymore. Looking back though, I do sometimes wonder if I got offended too easily and maybe my grandmother meant well, though at the time it seemed like she was bullying me."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2oew0	2019-06-19 23:30:42	thebro255	AITA for snapping at my sister and telling her to move out?	"Some context. I've (21) been living with my brother (25) for the past 2 years in a really small studio apt, we've had a few roommate problems here in there but we've learned to coexist and respect each others space and boundaries. 2 months ago my sister(23) came in from Mexico and since she arrived my brother and I have been been pretty supportive while she sorted herself out which honestly I don't mind she is our sister and that's the way we were raised.

When she first arrived everyone lived in harmony. After a few days my brother and I gave her some space to put her stuff in. After a few weeks in she got a job and had expenses to pay so we told her not to worry about rent so she could save more money and next month she might be able to contribute. Anyways now that she is more ""comfortable in the apt"" she leaves her stuff everywhere. leaves make up all over the place, goes out comes home super late waking everyone up. She sometimes eats on the bed we all share and I tell her to eat elsewhere since we all share it, she keeps doing it so I remind her that's my bed she is eating on tells me it's no one's bed since we're siblings and we should share everything I remind her I paid for it... and we go on and on with the same issues.

Last couple days she's been putting music on her phone (without headphones) and leaves it playing until she falls asleep and I have to get up and turn it off. I have really bad insomnia so I told her once again to be considerate about everyone in the room and to please turn it off. (My brother is asleep at this point). She says she'll lower the volume, I can still hear the music and so after a couple minutes and a failed attempt to fall asleep I tell her to please turn it off (I'm losing my cool), she snaps and tells me it's already low in volume and to stop bitching, I fucking snap and tell her there's no reason I should even be dealing with this shit and that we're doing her a favor by letting her stay in our apt, she says ""this isn't even your house"" and I remind her that I've been paying rent for the past 2 years and she hasn't contributed a single dime yet. At this point she increases the volume of her cellphone it's 1:30AM (I'm boiling in anger at this point) so I tell her this is not her place, that she's really disrespectful and inconsiderate and that the last 2 months have been pretty stressful with her living there I told her she should just fuck off and that I'll kick her the fuck out if she continues. She said I'm always critical about her staying with us always focusing on money etc. She turned off the music and I think she started crying. I felt bad for what I told her. Honestly it's not about the money but the fact that she is not considerate about everyone's space specially in such small apartment so that we all can coexist.

c2oevi	2019-06-19 23:30:39	glasscoffeepress	AITA for ruining my friendship over jealousy?	"Hear me out, I stayed friends with my ex after we broke up. I knew it was a bad idea but it was mutual and there was talk we might end up back together. I made it clear six months later that if we were just friends I would like to know about her next relationship. Well fast forward a few weeks and she calls me freaking out and I am worried for her but she can't communicate any clear message. I honestly thought she might've taken some drugs. It turns out she was having an ethical dilemma dealing with guilt about cheating on me before we broke up. But because of her inability to actually go through with it, she confessed her love for me for the first time. Then made some comments I didn't understand involving her parents and her childhood. Because I was at work, I couldn't check my phone all day and didn't realize my new phone was *blocked*. 

Edit: I should clarify, she was probably trying to call me, but at&t blocked my phone because it was brand new and unrecognized. She might've blocked me after my emotional night at her place.

I was worried but also fantasizing about reuniting with her. So, unable to reach her, I went to her apartment after work. She answered in her underwear and I thought either she is with someone else, or we are getting back together again possibly. Boy was I wrong, she said she had a crush on someone else before she left me and was texting him the whole time. She adamantly denied any sex or cheating, but I still felt betrayed. I had tried so hard to ignore my romantic love for her and just be friends, only to find out she had a secret relationship from before we met. I told her how I thought we might be starting over that day and she said maybe someday but she was still talking to the other guy. I tried to keep it together because I know we might not be right for each other and she was not my girlfriend anymore. I left feeling angry and guilty for feeling angry. Next day I missed her call. Then she texts me if I don't want to speak anymore it's ok. I text asking does she really want to stay friends? And just like that she never responded.

Anyway, he’s always wanted to be rich but never wanted to work for it. His wife has gazillionaire parents and whilst she does work the pair of them pay for nothing in their life. They had a house bought for them in the Bay Area, the dad even pays her phone bill still. Well my brother didn’t work for the first 3 years he lived here. When I moved here about 2 years ago I wanted to work and was excited for all this new opportunity. Me and my wife have no financial support but we do okay between us because we save our money and don’t over spend. 

Well now my brother has decided he wants a job from a bit of pressure of his father in law and likely sick of not having his own cash to spend. The first thing he did was apply to a more Jr role where I work - my boss saw it was my brother and gave him an interview. My brother then says I have to put in a good word for him so he can ace the second interview and get the job. He’s milking my good reputation to make him look good and thinks this is an easy way to get employed.

I told my boss not to hire him. My thinking here is that I worked damn hard to get this job and even harder to build a solid reputation - my brother has spent his life kind of blagging himself into good situations and this time I’m not having it. If he wants to work he should have to work as hard as everyone else to get there. 

My wife was kinda shocked and thought it seemed harsh as he had already gotten a second interview and when I asked my dad (sworn to secrecy - I 100% trust him) he said it was a little harsh on my end as he’s my brother. 

I just don’t think I owe him such an easy pass?!"	Asshole	1	0
c2oec1	2019-06-19 23:29:10	crazywife1234	AITA for being upset with my husband about his job?	"My husband works as a general manager of a store. Recently, his regional manager has been calling on him to cover shifts in other stores as well as being responsible for covering his own store, making him work 50+ hours a week. 

Whenever he comes home and tells me about another shift he's got to cover somewhere else, I piss and moan. Admittedly, I carry on like a child, because I fucking miss him and I am tired of being a single parent while he works all the time. 

I've tried talking about how it bothers me, in a calm manner. I've thrown a fit. I've cried. I've yelled. And he never sees my point of view. His is ""I don't have a choice, it's my job."" But... It's *not* his job. He's NOT salary. He's assigned to ONE store. He could say no. But he wants to be the hero and never say no to his regional manager.

He is willing to drop everything and do whatever his job requires. He will cancel doctors appointments, miss school events, etc... For his job. And his excuse is ""I'm the only one making money and I can't just get fired."" Well what the fuck, they're not going to fire him for not covering another stores shift. 


So Reddit... AITA for being fed up with this? Is it so wrong for me to want him to make some time for his family?

c2ods0	2019-06-19 23:27:42	Lethal_0428	AITA for being upset about a vacation?	"Back in the spring, my family began planning a family vacation to a nice beach town. I was excited, and asked if I could bring my girlfriend of a year and a half along. I offered to pay for all of the expenses for her and I. My parents said it was fine. I invited my girlfriend, who was thrilled to be able to go. She requested a week off from work. Everything was shaping up to be a great vacation.

 As the date drew closer, my parents (mainly my mother) had some concerns. First, expenses. Although I would be paying for food/activities, they would still have to pay for a room for 5 people. I’m not sure why, but that’s the reason they gave. Second, sleeping arrangements. My family is very conservative, and doesn’t agree with my girlfriend and I sharing a bed. To avoid conflict, I agreed that we’d sleep separately. Eventually, they just decided that they wanted a family vacation, and said that the original trip wouldn’t work, so they canceled it. Everyone was upset, including my girlfriend, who had been preparing to go. My parents said to keep our schedules open, as we may go do something a bit smaller, so I told my girlfriend to keep that week available.
 
A few weeks later, my parents plan another surprise trip to another beach, but make it clear that my girlfriend was not to be invited. I was livid, and my girlfriend was crushed. I felt that they should’ve at least been direct about it, rather than cancel plans and make new ones excluding her.
 
Here we are, the week of the vacation. My girlfriend is miserable, feels excluded, and can’t help but fear that she did something wrong to make my parents hate her. I’ve tried to make the best out of it, but I feel terrible about what happened, and I miss her. My parents are acting like everything is fine, and that no one has a right to be upset. When I tried to bring up how I felt to my mom, she called me argumentative and ungrateful, claiming that no one is entitled to be invited, and that I didn’t have to come along if I was going to “ruin it” for everyone else. Am I being the asshole?

Edit: I feel like I should include that I am 19, she is 17 almost 18, and I still live with them while I’m attending college."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2odnw	2019-06-19 23:27:26	butfirstcoffee427	AITA for forgetting about my friend’s bachelorette party?	"My friend is getting married this winter, and her bachelorette party is planned for the first weekend of August, though the location and all haven’t been finalized yet. I am one of the bridesmaids in her wedding, and was planning on going to the bachelorette party. 

Meanwhile, my husband accepted a job offer in a very far away state about a month ago, and they gave him a fall start date. He accepted the offer, and we started planning for a cross-country move to occur in late September. 

Yesterday, they contacted him and asked to move the start date up two months. This new start date would benefit us in a lot of ways—namely, we could give our notice at work earlier, we could sell our house to someone looking to move into the district before the new school year, we could move in the summer, we could more easily find a daycare slot for our toddler since it would align with the new school year when slots open up, and it would benefit me in my ongoing job search to be able to offer a reasonably close start date. We decided to make it work, and spent the last 24 hours figuring out when we would need to move, giving notice to our current company, and starting to look for housing and finalize a moving company. 

My friend texted me today (her fiancé and my husband are really close) asking about the new start date and if I would still be able to go to her bachelorette party. I realized in that moment that no, I wouldn’t be able to go any more because it would be right in the middle of our move, and I would either be in our new city unpacking boxes or would still be here but have my toddler with nobody to watch him (our only overnight childcare option will be traveling out of the country that weekend). She is now upset with me because she thinks I’m bailing on her bachelorette party and because it wasn’t one of my first considerations in the past day. Honestly, I forgot that her bachelorette party was that weekend until she mentioned it, primarily because there are no actual plans yet, and partially because it just wasn’t at the top of my mind. 

Am I an asshole/shitty friend for forgetting about it and/or not going? I would have realized eventually, but I’ve literally known about the new move date for 24 hours, and to be honest, her bachelorette party isn’t one of my priorities right now when we still don’t even have a place to live."

c2oddz	2019-06-19 23:26:43		AITA for not helping an old friend get a job at my work place?	"Hi everyone! The story starts out in 2014 when I was working at a dead end call center. I made friends with this lady I worked with. I left the position last year to pursue a better career path that would allow me to flourish and move up within the company.  I have been there for a year and 3 months, working OT, going above and beyond to build repor with upper management, and I'm slowly moving up in the ranks.

I got a text message from her about 3 days ago asking where I worked. She had recently gotten divorced and needed work with higher pay asap. 
 I told her about my job and how it did offer advancement opportunities, if you put the work in and earn it. I told her where to find an application and she thanked me.  When we worked together, we did work pretty hard but felt like it was useless since the promotions would go to people who kissed managements ass or had an ""in"" such as someones uncle knows the director etc etc. It was very discouraging so I understood and felt I'd be helping a friend out. (Plus I'd get a $300 bonus if she stayed for 180 days. )

So, about a day ago I got a wild hair and decided to reactivate my Facebook account just for shits and gigs. I'd been off the grid for about 2 years and wanted to see what everyone was up to. I came across her profile and immediately regretted my decision to give her my jobs information. Since I left in March of 2018, she's had 4 different jobs which she has trashed every single one mercilessly on her Facebook and Glassdoor. She named names!!

 I never even knew she had left the call center! The call center was God awful but I never remembered her to be so dramatic about it. Not only was she trashing her old jobs and old coworkers, but her ex, people she used to be close friends with, and so on and so forth. No one is safe. I JUST received an email from my HR department, stating they recieved an application and resume from her with my name as a reference. 

I know she needs help with a job because of the divorce but at the same time, I don't want to be associated with her professionally. I asked my closest friends and recieved mixed reviews. One friend said I was being a dick and she needed help. Another friend told me to just tell HR she wouldnt be a good fit and shrug my shoulders when she asks me for an update. Another friend told me to come clean about my decision to tell HR to pass on her. My 4th friend said she wont be there that long and to just take the bonus. 

Would I be a complete asshat if I told HR not to hire her?

c2oda4	2019-06-19 23:26:29	Kiwistring	AITA For Refusing To Pay?	"A friend of mine wanted to go on a trip to a location that is 8 hours away from our city. They invited their friends (that I do not know) plus myself and a few other mutual friends. They booked the Airbnb and said it would be $56 per person. No problem. A week and half before the trip, I find out I will not be able to get off work the day we plan to leave (a Friday). I considered leaving the next day (Saturday). Then I thought about the idea of driving 8-8.5 hrs on Saturday morning just to come back Sunday night because I have work on Monday at 8am. To add more conflict, I have a online midterm on Saturday that needs to be done that day. I explained this to my friend and they said they understood and that “duties and responsibilities come first”. 

Fast forward to this morning. I get a text explaining that since I did confirm earlier in the month, that I’m going to still need to pay my $56 because the remaining party that is still going is now having to pay $80. I was told “I trusted everyone to check their calendars”. The problem with this statement is that the Airbnb was booked in May and I started a new job and graduate school in June so I would not have been able to know what my calendar was going to look like. 

The way I see it, if the remaining party cannot pay the additional $24 then they probably should not be going on the trip in the first place.

I work all day. My wife works all day. Our kid is awesome, we play with him until he passes out each night. From there we have anywhere between 90-120 minutes of time my wife and I are awake at the same time while not preoccupied. Usually this is when we bust out Fargo, breaking bad, etc. 

Quality tv series or movies are one of my favorite things. I love all the little things from the music timing, what the point of a certain shot is, the small hints presented on screen. All that stuff. 

As we are watching a show I will see something that falls back to a previous season or something and look over in awe to my spouse with a “no way!” Look who will be looking at her phone and then 4 seconds later say “oh my gosh because that is from the other season!” And try to play it cool. I haven’t confronted her on this yet but kind of want to say “no phones during tv or movie time.” We are in our house, both had long days. She is just unwinding. The woman works like a madman and is a crazy good mother. She is always getting told how she needs to relax! Maybe she has found that through winding down on her phone each night. I am irritated. I don’t hate my spouse over her use of her phone, I just want to share that moment of “how neat”. This happens enough that last night as I was drifting off to sleep I had the feeling in my heart, Am I the asshole for wanting her to give up her phone so i can enjoy my shared tv experience with her?

c2ocpf	2019-06-19 23:24:56	throwaway4353454	AITA for not closing my relationship?	"In October my partner (2 years, both in college) sat me down and told me that they saw a future with me, but didn't want to give up experiences while they were young and wanted to have an open relationship. I wasn't happy with it. However, they were persistent and assured me they'd get it out of their system so I agreed. We set these ground rules:

\- Always use protection

\- No mutual friends

\- Change your sheets and clean your room after anything

\- Any information was fair game if the other person directly asked, but otherwise no obligation to share

We didn't set any timeline for closing the relationship.

We agreed to see each other as normal during the week, and to give each other space on Fridays/Saturdays. My SO is involved in greek life and they go out every weekend, and it isn't my thing, so we were already sort of doing this.

I tutor young kids for extra cash. On Fridays I spend a couple of hours with a kid and help them with their reading. The parent is late 20s and has split custody with their ex. I come over between 5:00 and 7:00, and the parent's ex comes to pick them up for the weekend right at 7:00. That week after the kid left and I was packing up, the parent asked me if I wanted to stick around for dinner. As you might guess, they fed me dinner and proceeded to put the moves on me and we had sex.

This became a regular thing and would also spill over into Saturday mornings, and after a while, I'd come back Saturday nights after they were back from work. They ""don't have time for dating"" and don't mind my relationship status. It's strictly sex and small talk.

I knew my SO was hooking up on weekends (expected this) because a friend of mine in told me about something they saw thinking my SO was cheating. I never asked my partner about anything directly, and they never asked me anything. It didn't really impact our relationship at all during the week.

We both stuck around for the first summer session this year. This past weekend my SO said they wanted to close the relationship (I suspect because there aren't any parties to go to). I informed SO that I had a weekend arrangement that I didn't want to give up. SO asked for specifics and had an absolute **meltdown** when I told them about my regular hookup.

I asked SO what the big deal was and they said: ""\[Greek life friends\] told me that you weren't hookup material and since you didn't even like to go out that it was a safe bet I would be the only one hooking up.""

I told SO that they were naive, and stupid for not ever asking me if I was doing anything. I said that I wasn't interested in closing the relationship just because their side of it had temporarily dried up. SO huffed and puffed about it for a while, but ultimately relented when I didn't budge. Our sex life has dwindled, but that doesn't particularly bother me. I am going to end it soon, but I honestly feel like it's necessary to assert myself and make a point.

AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the judgements. I lurk this sub a lot and I notice gender bias that goes both ways based on the flavor of the day, so I omitted gender purposefully. It's been interesting watching people guess, but I am male and my SO is female. Her friends basically told her that I was a square and wasn't the type to be able to have casual sex even if I wanted it. They were wrong obviously. After I graduated high school I was a megavirgin, and to people who don't know me I still give off that vibe. The truth is that that summer I went on a trip to a certain European country, read a book on the flight over that changed my perspective a lot of things, and over the course of that trip had my first ""everythings."" Have had 0 trouble with women since. My girlfriend knows all of this, but I guess she heard what she wanted to hear from her friends.

I was mostly curious to see if people cared that I was basically still hooking up with my tutoring client on the weekends out of spite. This wasn't a validation post, I was honestly expecting ESH but more so my GF."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Let me just start by saying I know there is more to a relationship than sex. This is like one of the only issues my girlfriend and I have. Seriously otherwise things are great. 

So we have not been having sex much over the last 9 months. Mostly because we traveled a lot together and the sex drive just isn't there for her when we are spending so much time together. Alright fair enough. Before that, we were having sex maybe 4 or 5 times a week. She doesn't like to talk about our lack of sex, not really sure why, I think maybe she feels guilty? I have been pretty understanding about the whole thing, I think. I think it's fair for me to be disappointed when she doesn't want to have sex, just as it's fair for her to say no. I don't really try and initiate anymore, because I know I will be rejected. Which again, sure, I get it. 


Since we've been back from our trip we have had sexy times twice. I'm not trying to keep track. It just so happens that I remember both times. It's been idk, 10 days or something.

"I'm 18 and I'm about to head off to college, and i still have to buy a car that can give me better mileage because I'm a commuter. Just to give perspective, I do have about $6000 in the bank right now. 

My family has never been well off, and I've definitely given my mom money before. But we recently hit a particularly rough spot, and as of June 9th, my mom owed me $650. That's all been added up just since spring break of this year. I've paid the phone bill, her car payment, money for a cake, last minute grad party setup, etc.

Yesterday, she took $230 out of my account without asking first, and i called and asked her about it. She said she meant to tell me afterwards and that she feels awful about it. I could have almost $7000 in the bank now. I guess I'm just upset because i put myself through a job that i hate and rarely buy anything for myself. I'm trying to save up, i really am. 

I think where my moral dilemma comes in is that I'm her kid. She's cared for me and my siblings for this long. Why not give back and help? She's a hard worker. Literally works 7 days a week. And I'm commuting to college, so I'm still going to be living with her and taking her resources. I almost feel like i owe it to her to give her money. 

I feel bad for being angry with her, but I'm also just angry for all that's been taken in such a short amount of time. No, i haven't said anything hurtful to her.

Friend 1 (who I will now call Cortney) and Adam had dated for a month or two but remained friends. He never liked me from the first time we ever met. I have absolutely no idea why. Anyway, he messaged me with screenshots from a DM between him and Courtney. Basically, she was complaining that I was speaking my thoughts. Adam started to call me rude names and say mean, untrue stuff about me and my social life. He said that nobody liked me for some stupid reason and that nobody would ever love me.

He was with Meredith for a long time-a year or two-and they had a little girl together. After they broke up, Meredith kind of latched on to me and we started hanging out. It didn't take me long to discover that what she really wanted was to use me to keep tabs on Buddy.

Also, she was nuts.

[Also-also](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/crazycredits), she refused to accept the fact that Buddy was done with her, and she spent all her time obsessing about it.

He could yell in her face that he hated her and never wanted to speak to her again and she'd say stuff like

*""Why would he go out of his way to say he hates me if he didn't still love me""?*

Facepalm.

*""You know he loves me because he's not dating""*

Sigh.

(**spoiler**: he was dating. He just kept it secret because he didn't want Meredith making trouble.)

This girl would go on and on in my friend group and we would side-eye each other guiltily. It was so awkward because everyone knew he was done with her and that he was dating other girls. No one wanted any part of this dumpster fire, though. We all had been friends with Buddy for years, and she was a relative newcomer.

My God, though, this girl looked so foolish! She'd just go on and on about their *lurv,* and how eventually they would be together again, once Buddy grew up a bit...it was nonstop. It was so hard to keep my mouth shut, and we talked all the time about whether we were doing the right thing by keeping it from her. We felt cruel for letting her keep her hopes up, but we felt like telling her was betraying Buddy.

Finally, we had been out drinking one night, and Meredith was asking me over and over about this girl (Buddy was dating her, but denying it to Meredith) and I kept saying ""I don't know, I don't know""...

After the eleventy-billionth time she said ""Just tell me, I won't tell Buddy you said anything, etc..."" I finally said

""Jesus Christ, they're a couple, ok?"" (I've never been great at lying.)

A few days later, I'm hanging out with Boyfriend and Buddy comes roaring up in his truck and jumps out. He's furious.

Of course, Meredith told him she knew about New Girl.

Of course, she went nuclear on Buddy.

Of course she told him I was the one who told.

Boyfriend thinks I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong.

My friends and I kind of think that I did the right thing by putting her out of her misery.

Buddy got over it, but he still thinks I'm the asshole.

Am I?

I never wanted to be in that position, I was unwillingly placed there, It was a very uncomfortable place to be.

FAQ's from comments:

*Why didn't you tell her to knock if off*? We did. She just couldn't stop.

*Why did you hang out with her*? She kind of latched onto us and showed up. She could be very dogged. Also, I come from a small town with few nightspots. She just showed up; it wasn't hard to find us.

*But still, why didn't you tell her she was unwanted*? Because it's hard to be that mean."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Sooo, it is when they freaked out. Obviously it is my first car, so I don't have big experience in maintaining a car, so I was shocked a bit. Well the problem is, since the beggining we have agreed that this car will be my training car - a car mainly used to drive every day, and stuff like scratching, marks etc. is expected. Basically they are calling me an asshole for this, and that I don't deserve anything more ever.

They also have problems with me no clearing inside - a bottles, some sand on mats.

I don't know what to say and what to think now.

c2o56q	2019-06-19 23:05:59		AITA for choosing not to attend my brother’s wedding?	"This has been eating at me for a few days now. My brother (let’s call him Bob) got married last weekend. It was a small ceremony with only immediate family, grandparents, and some very close friends. I did not attend, due to reasons outlined below. 

Bob and I have always been on pretty good terms, until recently - which I admit is at least partially due to my own personal issues with his life choices. 

Bob is incredibly smart, always has been. Computer science degree from U of I, built a successful business from the ground up. Kind, caring. Everyone who meets him loves him. One of those. I always kind of aspired to be like him. 

Anyway, about a year ago, Bob began to use social media as a platform for his new endeavor into the “life coaching” industry. Sigh. His posts are basically regurgitations of self-help books and social media motivators. His “clients” seem to be misguided individuals who want the extravagant material life, which we’re all subjected to daily via instagram/facebook, without having to work for it. 

Think: “visualize it, and the universe will provide.” 

And they’re paying him actual money for these empty life lessons. Again, Bob is a smart and successful guy but he has ZERO qualifications to guide anyone as a “life coach” - even that term makes me cringe. The way I see it, this is a classic case of the blind leading the blind. 

ANYWAY -  this brings me to why I chose to not attend his wedding. Bob’s fiancé (let’s call her Jess) is also very active on social media. Even her job involves managing social media accounts for the company she works for. Jess is sweet and very loving towards Bob, and she is supportive to his new career choice as a “life coach”. She is 100% encouraging and enabling this behavior, which I see to be a sure sign of a dysfunctional relationship. And because of this, even though I can see she makes Bob very happy, this is a union I cannot support. Thus, my absence at the wedding.  AIAA for not attending?"	Asshole	1	0

So my husband and I are married for 4 years this summer but we reach a death lock and I’m starting contemplating divorce, which scares me because it feels like the obvious solution.

The story started 6 years prior. I came to the US as a student and I meet this amazing person! He has a very different personality than mine: I’m a people person, very outgoing and out spoken. He is more shy, homing and don’t have many friends. We dated for 6 months and then I went back to my country. Back on the day we couldn’t get married because he didn’t had a structured carrier and I couldn’t work legally. His family is from the middle west but we met in California. After 2 years and half of distance dating (we saw each other every 6 to 8 months). He took a job in a medium size town in the Southeast. His job involve a lot of time outside the house, usually it’s 5/3. 

The beginning was super hard on me: I had to adapt to a different culture and make new friends. I don’t have family close by. Also I had to transition my carrear and improve my English. Fast forward I got a great job, we bought a house and I made some friends in this town. My husband never learned how to speak my mother language.

Every now and then he taunts me to move to his parents city. I never said I would, at the beginning I was just letting him talk and hopefully he would forget about it. 

It took a time to realized that I don’t want to start over again. I already let so many thing go to stay with him that I don’t want leave the stability that I acquire in this town. I think I gave too much and he has given too little. Why do I have to abandone everything again?!

He claims he is depress and he always thought about this town as a temporary place. He doesn’t have any friends here, also he is not someone who is in constantly touch with his old friends. He thinks he will be better in this home town. 

He forgets that when he leaves I have to stay here by myself and it took to much effort to develop my safety net in this place.

So we are in this death lock: he is depress and wants to go back and I don’t want to star over. Maybe we should part ways. I don’t know what to do but it’s been dreadful living with someone so negative. I try to not engage but he is driving me nuts!

He agree on marriage therapy but we haven’t started. I fell we love each other but I can’t have this arguments anymore. I feel I’m loosing respect...

TL; DR: married and my husband wants to go back to his home town. I don’t want to. Should be part ways?"		1	0
c2o50v	2019-06-19 23:05:29	Politix_Shmolitix	AITA for speaking to my nephew sternly when I feel he is being too rough with my daughter?	"A little context here. My nephew (N) is 6 and my daughter (D) is 3. N is obviously much older and stronger than D and at times is a little more rough with D than I am comfortable with. When my brother and sister-in-law come to family gatherings, it’s as if they check out and don’t supervise their kids at all. There have been a few instances where I have had to stop N from squeezing/hugging/roughhousing too hard/much and spoke to him in a stern voice saying “D is much younger than you, you can’t do that with her” because my brother and SIL sit by idly and think it’s cute. Most recently, N taught D about penis and vagina and D was running around the house screaming vagina at the top of her lungs. I told N that it was very inappropriate and she is too young to be taught that. N was very upset and went and hid with SIL. 

My brother and SIL have apparently been bottling up for years that I have been yelling at N and N thinks I don’t love him (which is obviously not the case). I’ve never yelled at him but have spoken to him sternly. A blow out fight ensued over the last couple of days where my SIL unloaded about how I cannot yell at her kids and that N has been shafted for years because we won’t let him be a kid and play with his cousin. All I want is for them to know I am not fully comfortable with my child running amok unsupervised and if N is doing something inappropriate and they are no where to be found, I need to be the adult in the room and tell him he is being wrong.

To make a long story short, it didnt work out well between two of my roommates and so one of them has to move out. It was pretty much a mutual thing when we decided who.

The thing is, our apartment has a $250 moving fee for anyone who wants to change apartments. I didn't want to help the moving roommate pay from the start because at one point there had been an argument that was never really settled. We both got heated. She got upset, and since she was sad, I decided to be civil. I was still irritated for awhile. Eventually though, I think I got over it.

My other roommates thought that it would be mature of us if we just all split the bill equally. Again, I didnt want to pay anything, but to maintain the maturity of my roommates, I agreed.

Time comes to pay, and I dish out my portion, as does one of my roommates. My other roommate, however, says she's broke and doesn't have the money to help pay up. So now the roommate that's moving out is asking if me and the other roommate that paid can give her a little more to help out with the fee.

The thing is, I dont want to. I already gave over $60 (which is a lot to me), and I think I've done more than my share.

&#x200B;

My sister (22) has been vacationing in Europe for the past 3 weeks with 4 of her friends. She's paying for it with her money, not my parent's. My parents offered our house for them to all sleep in for the night after they come back, where they won't arrive until around 2AM. I was asked a month ago if I would be okay with letting 2 of them sleep in my room, and I said yeah sure, but felt a bit pressured to do it. After giving it more thought, I decided I didn't really want random people to sleep in my room when there were other places where they can sleep.

&#x200B;

The plan my parents are proposing is 2 people sleeping in my bed, 2 people sleeping in the guest room, and my sister sleeping on the couch. I countered this with having 2 people sleeping in a guest room, my sister sleeping in a room that was formerly hers, and then the other two sleeping on a futon and then a couch. I don't really see why this is a problem, as there are obviously other arrangements available that would also work.  


My parents have made it clear that they're very unhappy with my retraction of my initial answer, and have been suggesting that I wouldn't be allowed certain ""privileges"" in the future, such as bringing a family car with me when I go back to school in the fall, or to go on trips of my own. I understand that I am staying rent free in their house, but I also feel like I should have the right to my own room and privacy, and should be able to do this without getting this much push back. I really just don't want to have to deal with messing up my routine just so 2 random people are slightly more comfortable sleeping, and the idea of them sleeping in my bed just makes me uncomfortable.

It feels odd to me that my sister's wants are being placed higher above mine.

c2o2lg	2019-06-19 23:00:06	strangeanuz	AITA -Bad Review for Family’s Business	"So to give some background, my cousin and her husband own a mechanic/legal services shop. My car had been needing maintenance for some time and they’re a fairly new business so I thought I’d give them a shot since I felt I could trust them.
Now, I know nothing about cars or how to maintain them when they’re a little higher in age like mine (a 2006 Chrysler 300) which would always lead me to run my gas tank to empty every time. The car would have sporadic incidents of not starting, the car would make no noise as if it was dead but the codes and odometer would still appear on the dash board.
I take in my car and they tell me it’s my catalytic converter and that I need to pay $800 upfront so that they can order the part.
While I normally would’ve asked for a second opinion with that hefty of an amount for a part, again, I trusted them. So I pay for the part and the next day it’s ready for pick up. In total everything was $1050.
I’m driving my car around for a couple of days and my car doesn’t start again, same problem from before. I called them up wondering what they did for me if the problems still there. They were really quick to blame the age of my car and the lack of maintenance, I’m fully aware I don’t take the best care of my vehicle but I brought it in to fix those problems and that did not happen.
So I take it in a second time, and they tell me it was a misdiagnosis on their part but that my car needed the catalytic converter anyways. Apparently the problem was with my fuel pump, all I really needed was a tube up which would’ve cost A LOT less than what they had me pay. They refused to negotiate ways to fix this as they still wanted to charge me full price to fix this “new” problem on top of the $1050 I paid for their misdiagnosis. Now I want to leave a bad review for them because all of their google reviews are manufactured by other family members and I want people to know what they’re actually getting into. I think they picked out the most expensive problem they could without thoroughly searching for what was actually wrong. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

About a year or two ago, my brother was in a bad state of mind. Depression too be specific. He would lock himself in his room and on one occasion the cops had to be called to our house. I don’t know the specifics of what happened because my mom kept us up in her room with the TV on full blast. It was a bad situation, and I even caught a glimpse of some... not good things on his arm.

He got moved to a new school and his mood improved a lot. He’s a lot more jokey and happy overall, but he’s also a hell of a lot more bossy.

 He’s interested in a lot of board games and video games that are long and take strategy, where in I like games that are short or have constant action. Even though we have at least 2 other people around at all times, it seems he always comes to me in specific to play these games, even though I’ve made it clear I hate them.

When he leaves, my dad or my mom or somebody will come up to be and talk to me about playing with him cause “He’s leaving soon” or “He’s getting better then he was” and I’m happy that he’s getting better and everything but I don’t think that him leaving makes it so that I have to be forced to sit for hours on end and be bored out of my mind.

Since he has retired we have both been doing equal housework which I don't think is right since I have worked whilst he hasn't. We both still earn basically equal money and I don't contribute to him financially since he has a pretty large pension and savings.

I've brought this up with my husband and he says he deserves this time off since he's worked his whole life which I don't think is fair since in a committed relationship we should both work for eachother.

c2o09v	2019-06-19 22:54:24	BraveBunny568	AITA for leaving my friend for calling me a manipulative person ?	"Over the course of 3 years we were friend, we've had many fallout. We know each other in real life, we spoke in real life, but every single argument have been on the internet, chatting. I'll try to give the most unbiased view on this subject as possible. I know I am not perfect, and some of them have myself being the asshole.

We've had our biggest argument ever. It started off as a nice and philosophical conversation, no big deal. We're giving reflexions, refutations like every other discussion. My friend starts to be upset, and starts saying that I don't care about my friends and she tells me that I said this, and how she will apologize if I did not.

I don't remember saying that at all. I said ""If I did say that, then I don't think it now, and forgive me"". I then remembered she did say something worse to me. She said to ""go die"" to me. I was very depressed at that time, so I tried to follow her advice, and very fortunately failed. I told her. She said that I was manipulating her and did not awknoledge she did say this to me.

While I agree I could be fairly manipulative when I was sixteen, I am no longer manipulative and apologized to everyone who had to deal with me. Plus, manipulation sickens me.

So I typed this exact message, wanting to end things between us, so that if she feels I am being manipulative, she can move on from me :

""Everytime we talk, it's the same thing. I don't manipulate, I am fully disgusted by this and your behavior. Everytime I feel like we go round in circles. I tried to end the discussion many time, but I felt like I should respond to you because you keep asking me to prove something. I want to sleep. We are stressed out, we are having our final exams and I think it's for the better if we quit being friends. I don't think I can be your friend anymore, I don't want to hurt you. We are coming from different backgrounds, and we are thinking more and more differently. I am sorry. I think we should leave this relationship before one of us is eaten up.""

My ex-friend now answered with :

""What ?! I am crying now. You know I am right. Why are you trying to guilt trap me ? Telling me I said ""Go die or whatever"" is so messed up. I am here for you, you cunt ! You're kidding me ! I am not gentle ! I love you a lot but everything is said.""

3 of my 6 friends are saying that I should have been more patient with her, and I am an idiot. My family and my other friends said I was right to leave her, but that was over very childish things (which, I agree).

But, AITA?  I feel like I am the asshole... If I am, then, I'll accept it and move on, if I am not, cool, I'll move one even faster.

TL;DR : Friend + I = argument each time. Friend said I said I didn't care. I apologize if I did say that. I replied ""not cool though, u said ""Go die"" to me. Friend : calls me manipulative. Me : lemme leave this friendship."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Not only do we get on well as work-friends, but I appreciate his contribution to the office; however, I wouldn't consider him more than an acquaintance outside of work.

This coworker of mine (we'll call him CW) is now leaving the position (which we share) after a year of being in the office, and while I'll miss him, I don't really feel moved to get him a gift. Honestly, I was thinking a heartfelt hug and maybe *maybe* picking him up a coffee his last morning would suffice.

The wrench in my plan was thrown when another person in the office (we'll call her Pam), cornered me and asked if I planned on ""doing anything for CW before he leaves"". I reluctantly replied ""um, yeah maybe something small"" to which Pam says ""well, you should get him a cake."" Now I saw where this was going so I offered ""yeah, WE could do that. That'd be nice"". And instead of picking up what I was putting down, she dismissively says ""you can just get it from a local grocery store or something"" which indicated to me that she's washing her hands of the situation. On top of that, she said I should get him a card for everybody to sign which, in my opinion, will make it seem like everybody pitched in when it was solely me putting in the effort.

I've known CW for his whole year here, and she's only known him a little over a month, so I'm not sure if that's why she's trying to put the onus on me. And the main thing that's weighing on my mind is that I've just moved to share this office space with Pam and her company (Pam is the office manager), so I don't want to make a bad impression.

I told him it did not mean that and that it was a derogatory term. He disagreed and said it had more than one meaning. He said that he was correct because he is older than I am and that I am too young to know. I find this ridiculous but I don't blame him. I told him my age has nothing to do with it, I was also sarcastic and said "" I guess I will listen to you because you're older and smarter "". What could I have done better? Am I a jerk?

So me (26)M and my partner (20) F recently broke up there was still a lot of love between us but she had been in relationships since she was 16 with a long time high school bf and then me for over a year and a half so she just felt like she needed time to be single. The problem is we both felt like we could be the right people for each other and we felt like there was a good chance we would wanna get back together in the future. At first I was pretty accepting and even recommended for her to move out of our apartment and back in with her mom so she could do her own thing. However handling all the bills on my own is putting me in a stressful position my bills are paid but I can't save anything. I have a decent job and if we were still living together I would be fine but on my own I have to work 6 to 7 days a week to keep up. I decided I needed to find something else so while working any overtime I can get I have also been going to and setting up job interviews everyday this week and have 3 for next week already and I'm getting overwhelmed. We have seen each other a couple times since the break up but the last time I saw her I admitted to needing her back I told her about the financial issues and the stress and just missing her when I go home. Unfortunately she feels she can't be in a relationship yet but still wants to keep me around so when she is ready she can come back unless she decides she doesn't want too. She has made comments about not getting back together but still tells me she loves me and mentions tons of reason she feels she would. It's just right now I feel like I'm drowning and could use a hand and she is bailing on me when I could use her there more then ever. I try to understand where she is coming from but honestly I feel like if she can't be there when I need her most what is the sense of taking her back when I get my shit together. As much as I try not to I am developing bitter feelings towards her and I don't want to the time we had was great and I wanna remember her that way.

c2nvv8	2019-06-19 22:43:51	throwaway523523523	AITA For not visiting my Grandpa who had Alzheimers before he died?	"This has been something I have felt conflicted about in the 2 years since and so I'd like some more opinions.

**Background info:**

My Grandpa and I (M22) did not have a close relationship and basically exclusively only saw each other at the family Christmas gathering, which even then - due to  my parents divorce - meant I would not see him for several years at a time. In the last 3-4 years I only saw him once or twice  for an hr or 2 at a time. 

Thus sadly my Grandfather and I didn't really know each other due to both his and my parents decisions and the feasibility of regularly meeting as we live 2 hrs away from him. I don't think that he was a bad person or anything, it's just that I barely knew him, if at all. 

&#x200B;

**On to the main issue:**

My Dad told me that my grandpa had been diagnosed with Alzheimers after his friends noticed problems with his behaviour and that he would be living in a facility from that point on. 

Within 6 months he was dead. 

There was no point at which it was indicated to us that he would die so quickly, however with Alzheimers I was somewhat aware that it's not all that uncommon, so if I really did want to see him I definitely had the opportunity. 

During those 6 months before his death my dad asked me 2 times if I would like to go down and see him.

Both times I felt quite conflicted and perhaps somewhat retrospectively took the easy way out in the sense that, I didn't have to make the ""final"" decision to see him at that point - at least I didn't think so at the time as they later turned out to be.

&#x200B;

**My rationale at the time:**

* I did not want to be literally confronted with the fact that someone I was supposed to love was severely mentally ill - and quite possibly not remembering me, which despite our minimal relations would still be hurtful.
* I felt that the time for a meaningful relationship had passed and that even if he were fully conscious, our relations would be awkward.
* Perhaps the most important reason though - was that I wanted my few memories of him to not be coloured by seeing him in such a state - sidenote - I honestly believe that it is really messed up that voluntary euthanasia isn't a legal option.  
* And finally the most petty reason was that it would be a full day trip to do something that really did not sound all that pleasant.

&#x200B;

I guess this is more of a validation post, but I have mulled over this a few times since his death and I seriously don't know if I was an asshole for not going to see him.

So my girlfriend (25) and I (f, 24) live together. She has a dog and I have two cats. I don’t let them sleep in the room with us. My girlfriend is really upset about it. She says “she thinks they’re like family and they deserve to sleep wherever they want.” 

Here are my issues. 

1) her dog (I’ll call him C) has and will chew up my things. My blankets, my pillows, my socks. If he’s in the room overnight, my things get destroyed and she hasn’t offered to replace them. I get that it’s a dog and that’s what dogs do, but I would like to avoid it if I could. 

2) I don’t know what it is, but C’s fur will get stuck in my skin and give me rashes. I can also feel it when I’m laying in bed at night. It keeps me up because I’m so itchy and uncomfortable. For some reason, C likes to lay EXCLUSIVELY on my side of the bed, on my comforter and pillow. Even if I cover them up with hers, he will paw hers out of the way to lay on mine. 

3) letting the cats in at night is all cute and stuff for the first couple of hours. But around 3 AM, they start being, you know, cats. They get into whatever they can, start messing with each other, knock things over, whatever there is to do that can be annoying, they do it. This is all fine for my girlfriend, who could sleep through a jet plane crash landing into our house. I, on the other hand, have a really hard time sleeping and I’m always the one that gets up and kicks them out. I get up several hours earlier than she does, and it annoys me that it interrupts my sleep every single time. 

She’s decided that she’s going to start sleeping in the spare bedroom because (I quote) that I refuse to agree to “any compromise.” She’s never offered a compromise, for one. Two, I don’t appreciate that she seems to think that I love the animals less because I won’t let them into the room?  Occasionally the younger cat (11 months, so technically still a kitten), will cry outside the door because he wants to come in. The only reason he does that is because he knows she’ll cave and let him in. All three of them have multiple beds for them around the house and countless soft, warm, cozy places to sleep. It’s not like I’m making them sleep on cold concrete. 

I’m upset because it hurts my feelings that she would rather sleep with the cat and C over me. I’m also upset because she doesn’t seem to care about the reasons I didn’t let them in, and was very willing to let them in anyways and make my nights hell. I’m upset for the THIRD time (I know, shocker) that she implied in any way that I’m not a good pet owner because I don’t let them in the room. 

She thinks I’m overreacting and I’m an asshole to both 1) our pets for not letting them in and 2) her because she’s upset that the pets can’t come in and I’ve never “made any compromises.”

c2nstt	2019-06-19 22:36:41	Throwawaydhdowo	AITA for disciplining girlfriends nephew	"My girlfriends mother practically raises her other daughters son, he is about 2 and a half years old.

My girlfriend and I just got our first apartment together so her mom has been visiting with her nephew quite often.

I was never around babies growing up and I am an awkward introverted person in general, so I never really knew how to interact and play with him until recently as he's been talking more and I been around him more.

I'm not sure if I'm the asshole doing something wrong or if she's being an asshole.

The following events occurred prior to her storming out the house and texting my girlfriend that I'm an asshole to the baby are :

Me telling him ""No you cant hit me these are expensive!"" - the baby hit me in the face trying to grab my glasses, his grandmother watched and did not discipline him so I had to say something. 

I repeatedly told her not to give him red juice because of the new white carpet and I gave her and the baby a dirty look when he inevitably spilt the drink on the carpet. Apparently this was rude of me to say when he can and cant drink.

Baby offers me a cookie and I take it and say ""oh no thank you"" and put it back in box. I get death stares and told that I should have eaten the cookie. 

When he goes to grab my blanket and says ""mine"" I say ""no its mine"" and gently tug back. Apparently I'm suppose to give it to him or I'm an asshole.

Baby unties my mocasines and I say ""nooo you cant do that"". - this is when she immediately grabbed him and stormed out the door without saying a word."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2nrwq	2019-06-19 22:34:24		AITA for getting upset at friends for treating me differently because I have more money?	"I live in a poor part of my city. Most kids at my highschool come from families that don't make a lot of money, including all of my friends.
I know I'm lucky to not have to struggle as much as they do. I live in a nice-ish house, big compared to everyone else's. It would be a stretch to say I'm anywhere close to 'rich.' I'm lower middle class at best. 

My friends all know where I live, and what kind of jobs my parents have. They know I can afford to buy lunch at school everyday and have a cell phone plan. Up until now, there's never really been a divide between us because of income differences, but if they're short a couple dollars I'll pay it for them, no questions asked. Things worked like this for a while.

Recently, the parents of two of my friends found out that other friend gave me two dollars for lunch, because I forgot my wallet at home that day. I paid her back literally the next day but that was enough for the parents to gossip and decide that their children can't buy me anything anymore because I'm middle class.

Since then, my whole friends group refuses to help me with anything money-related. I feel kind of hurt.

This wasn't a shock to me as I predicted this based on their most recent behavior. Well. I got over it pretty quickly. Yah know if they were not happy together whatever it is their lives they should be happy right? Well... A month ago my friend informed me that they separated because my mother had an affair (my best friend's mom is best friends with my mom). Oof. That hit me hard. After a week or so I talked to my dad then my mom about it. My talk w/ my mom went something like this: ""an affair was not the answer to the problems our marriage had, but S (my best friends mom gonna use S instead of her name) shouldn't have told your father I should have I was just waiting for the right time. And then that cycle would repeat w/ her saying it wasn't okay but S shouldn't have told my dad she should have."" She says she was talking to her therapist about when to tell my dad. Well I agreed because I assumed the affair was only a couple months old (I was never given a specific time of how long it lasted). Oh boy... I am on vacation visiting family in Brazil w/ my father and the affair comes out while talking w/ my cousin. My dad casually says it lasted at least 2 years... I never knew it lasted that long. I  wanted to cry that night but shared a room w/ my father so I didn't. So basically what I am saying is that I am glad S came out and told my father because Jesus I am sure my mother never would have come out and told him. And my mother was also the one who wanted to wait to tell us (the kids). Basically my mother is a coward and I fucking hate her now but every time I interact w/ her I begin to sympathize but afterward realise how stupid I am and that I should confront her for closure. But because I am TOO FUCKING NICE I can't ever tell her how much of a shitty person she is so I started avoiding her. WIBTA if I just straight up avoided her now?

Edit: my mother keeps attempting to hang out w/ me but I am extremely uncomfortable around her now and keep declining because she was one of my best friends and kind of destroyed my trust here.

Edit 2: When my brother was informed about the separation he asked about an affair and my mother said no despite my father's wishes to tell him then and having him and myself find out about it through a friend  over 6 months later means she prob wasn't planning on telling us."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2nqfm	2019-06-19 22:30:55	femboyfatale123	AITA to assume the housekeeping lady uses gloves when she is cleaning my apt?	"I hire a housekeeping service to clean my apartment every other week on Wednesdays. Part of their services include cleaning interior windows and making the bed, but they don’t do laundry unless I pay extra fees, and they only use “green” products. I’ve been happy with the service but I’ve never actually met the cleaning staff because they come while I’m at work. 

For the bed, they will actually change the sheets to fresh ones if I leave them a set of clean sheets on the bed, and throw the old sheets on a pile by the laundry for me to wash. If I don’t leave a set of sheets, they’ll just make the bed.

This morning, I was running super late. I have a FWB who lives in the same building. He comes over a lot for sex, and sometimes we play games involving his semen. He has been coming over once or twice a day since I came back from vacation recently. We were up until 3 or 4 am doing FWB things (hence running behind this morning because I overslept). I’ve been pretty busy with work and when I’m home, I’m busy entertaining his D, so washing my bed sheets became a very low priority action item for me. I think the last time I changed sheets was maybe 9 or 10 days ago. Which also means my FWB’s fluids are splattered and dried all over my sheets and pillowcases that haven’t seen the washer for days. 

This morning I ran out because I slept past my alarm. In all honesty I actually forgot today was house cleaning day in my rush. I came home to the scent of freshly cleaned apartment and saw my bed was made. I texted my FWB and told him the housekeeper probably thought I was a freak because my sheets and pillowcases must smell like dried cum to her (I notice it less because, well, I’m used to it). And then he texted back saying WTF and asked why I let the housekeeper touch my fluid soiled sheets and pillowcases. I just assumed housekeepers wore gloves. He told me no, not everyone wears them. So I googled it and sure enough, there are accounts of housekeeping staff at hotels like the Waldorf Astoria who work with their bare hands! (It was a Conde Nast Traveler article.)

Well I don’t know if my housekeeper wore gloves when she handled my sheets. I hope he or she did. But if she didn’t, it’s really her own fault for not using protective equipment when working right?"	Asshole	0	0

Hey Reddit,

Recently, a kid I barely knew from a school club got social media and started talking to me. I've texted him back to be nice but we really don't have much in common. It's really hard to talk to him because every time I talk to him we wants to hang out. Usually, I can dodge it by saying something like ""My family said no"" but then he starts planning for the future and I had no choice but to hang out with him. The things we like could not be anymore different. I am obsessed with basketball and shoes and rap and he likes plays and the weather and track and sending me pictures of the sunset outside his window. He joins into private plans I've made with my other friends, and it's pretty uncomfortable since he has no idea what we're doing most of the time. My friends and I were playing basketball one day he asked me if he can play with us (This was outside of school. He was there because he planned ahead and knew I was going to be there). I'm not trying to be mean but he doesn't know how to play so it made the game slow and it was very uncomfortable for everyone there .I've only talked to him in real life to be nice since I saw he was alone at the club we both did. He always texts me about things I have no idea about nor care about (like the weather, he wants to be a weatherman) or videos of him and his pets. Don't get me wrong I love animals but after the 50th video of him playing his dog, it get's old. He has a form of autism ( not sure what) and every time I lie to him I feel bad. He always comes up to me in school and tries to get into the conversations I'm in. It's really awkward because he always keeps looking at me and expects me to talk to him, but I can't just leave the conversation I'm in just because he came. This isn't the first time I was in a situation like this, but I got out of the other one because I ended up moving. He asked me today to hang out but I left him on read. Our school got out recently and every day from then until now he's asked me to hang out with him, and every day I make a new excuse. I can't do it, I know it's going to be boring/uncomfortable. As far as I know, he does not have anymore friends. I've asked my friends if I'm being a jerk and they all say yes because ""he's a special needs kid""."	Not the A-hole	0	0

The next day a random mutual friend asked me about said secret which could have only come from this person we shared drinks with.

I was concerned and told my new friend to be careful what you tell this other person as I have been asked about the secret conversation we had between the three of us.

My friend was obviously upset so had to have a word with the other person who shared the information.

I then felt like a complete shit stirrer as not only  I had upset my friend, the other person who shared the secret and the mutual friend but made me look like I was trying to cause trouble

c2nnhz	2019-06-19 22:24:01		WIBTA if I left my co-workers short-handed and told my boss that I absolutely needed to leave early this friday?	"Monday (after work) I had a doctor's appointment and my doctor ordered a blood test be done by the end of the week. I was not able to discuss needing a few hours off with my manager until today (wen). What I need is to be able to leave early from work fri for the blood test.

I work for a small company and am 1 of 12 employees that work as kitchen staff. We already have 1 employee on vacation and 2 who called off today. My manager doesn't want me to leave until noon (basically 1 hr early) on fri to get my blood test. 

The problem with this is that the only place I can get this test done is ""first come/first served"" there is always a wait time and frequently so busy by the afternoon that people can be turned away. (It's a free clinic that excepts my lack of health insurance and charges me based on income level- so LOTS of patients/ limited staff) My doctor told me to come as early as possible- which would be 9am. Another issue is that I have to fast until after the test. I start work at 5am, the latest I could eat before bed is 8pm. The lab has a lunch hour (12-1) so the earliest I could check in would be 1- then I still have to wait and I may not be out until 3 or 4pm. That's a 20 hour fast. 

My manager says that he absolutely needs me to stay on friday and is not willing to budge even though I offered to leave as late as 10:30am so I could be there by 11. I have no issues with my manager and like my job- WIBTA if I refused to stay past 10:30 on fri? 

If it matters- I am a good employee of 3 years with good attendance (with the exception of having to call off 4 days in a row two weeks ago- the reason I'm getting checked out now) and no write ups or warnings for anything. Also- we don't have any extra employees where I work. There is no one but my manager or one of the owners to cover me."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2nmpj	2019-06-19 22:22:15	eyesandeggs	AITA for telling my brother not to make a mess in the house I'm watching?	"I'm going to try and explain everything that lead up to our disagreement so bear with me. 

I live with my mom and stepdad while my brother lives with our dad. My mom/stepdad are out of town and I'm watching the house and dog while they are gone. Before they left my brother mentioned coming over for a few days with his girlfriend to visit some old friends, which I was fine with. I told him as long as he doesn't smoke in the house and make a mess it should be fine (I mentioned this to him because he smokes inside his room at our dads place and is generally a messy lerson). This was the first thing he got upset at me about and told me that me having to watch the house ""didn't mean shit"".

Before he came, we were talking over Skype and he mentioned he was gonna have his friend over. There is some history with them and there was an incident between them which in my book would be cause for ending a friendship. I told him I was surprised they were still friends because of the incident between them and he told me I was being judgemental. I probably could have worded it better but I was just stating what happened and surprised they were able to salvage a friendship. 

Lastly he has two dogs which are a handful, and my dog is pretty old. I didn't really want to deal with them so I asked him not to bring them, because one has been more aggressive towards me. When he came over yesterday he brought the dogs which put me in a pretty bad mood. So with all the things I talked about above we got into an argument and he said I was being a judgmental asshole who was trying to flex my fake responsibility over him.

c2ngut	2019-06-19 22:08:39	DilbertJunior	AITA for wanting to get our house blessed?	"Representing a friend.

&#x200B;

Just moved into a new flat with two other coworkers. We got the keys and as soon as we opened the door there was a really bad smell like something was rotting, all three of us agreed it smelled like something was rotting. 

&#x200B;

We then go upstairs and the bedroom doors have cracks down the door frames like someone tried to force themselves into the bedrooms while the doors were locked. They've been unable to get rid of the smell after cleaning etc.

&#x200B;

Most logical people would be like the smell is just a bin that hasn't been emptied etc. The cracked door frames could be someone drunk. This is a four bedroom house and the previous tenant was a single guy. 

&#x200B;

My friend is a religious background and feels uneasy in the house and would want the house blessed ""just to be safe"" however one of the coworkers is of an atheist got annoyed at the suggestion and doesn't want the house blessed saying its nonsense and doesn't exist. 

&#x200B;

If the person is atheist the house being blessed or not wouldn't make that much difference in reality right?. It would make the friend be able to relax more in their house for the next year, they seem anxious being in the house.

My step-daughter, 20F, has been dating a dude for 2 years.

I loathe the dude and so does the rest of her family. Because of the dude, my step-daughter stopped talking to her biological father, whose a chill dude; dropped out of college for him; and stopped coming over to see my grandchildren that I have custody over (long story).

c2nfnz	2019-06-19 22:05:49	TheOmega_	AITA For wanting control over my own phone during my summer break?	"Not sure if this is really enough of a dilemma to count or if I’m being petty but I want an objective opinion on this.

Also first time posting here. Also also mobile so sorry in advance.

First things first:
• yes my parents are very caring if not somewhat overprotective at times but I appreciate all they do (get on better with dad than mum but both are pretty cool most of the time)
• my phone was paid for, in full, simless, out of my pocket. My parents only pay for a £10 a month sim only contract
• I just finished my GCSEs, which was stressful, and I’m looking forward to enjoying (one of) the longest summers I will have in my lifetime, so I want as much liberty as I can get.

During the exam season (and school term in general) parents impose rule of: Phone gets taken away on nights Sunday through Thursday at 10.00pm, I can keep it all night Friday and Saturday.

Given I have just done gcses and I want my phone, I say I’m going to be keeping my phone all night every night, but I will be sleeping as I’m aware I still have shit to do and responsibilities (I.e. paper round in mornings, some other odd jobs for spare cash etc.)

My parents disagree, saying that they wish to keep normal rules but extend how long I can have my phone in the week to 10.30pm . I was not at all happy about this. Was kinda rude to my mum, which I don’t think she deserved and I feel bad, but am upset/annoyed about the strict rules.

I accept the rules are smart and necessary during term time, but why in SUMMER? Like I see no point. I want my freedom to talk to friends and I have the self control to go to bed when I need to, and it feels like they don’t trust me to do so. My dad also claims he told me about this rule change beforehand but my first time hearing it was tonight (Wed) I hearing it would start next week. I was given no input or say in this decision. I am annoyed and basically am refusing to cooperate with rule, but realise I’m being childish, but am frustrated bc I’m not being treated like a mature individual who can be trusted with something as simple as keeping their own phone in their room overnight. Am I being an asshole?

Sorry that was long and hopefully it all makes sense.

TL;DR - Parents take phone at 10pm during school time, I’m fine with this. I want phone during summer all night long (just did gcse exams [quite important and tiring exams, for any non Brit readers]) but parents say extended to 10.30pm each night and no longer. I refuse. AITA? 

Note to TL;DR: I recommend you read full post bc it’s kind of hard to summarise all the details and that tldr doesn’t really fully explain all sides of the situation."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Grew up together, his parents  call me their other daughter and vice versa. We lost connection for a few years (I was in a different province for a while) and when we reconnected he had a new boyfriend.

Well they've been together a couple years now and I've been slowly losing patience since day one. He apologizes for everything. Every sentence. If my forgiveness isn't convincing enough, he gets somewhat panicked and I'll have to comfort him for 10+ minutes until his next apology.  He'll also move on to try rubbing my shoulders, or braiding my hair, or massaging my hands. I guess he has a need to 'fix' and since he feels his apology isn't enough he goes into care-overdrive. I'm not a fan of any of this. And he has a really hard time backing off when I say no. I had to have a long talk with him and my friend because if I'm being touched after I've asked to stop, I start to panic and and get really angry (on the inside. He doesn't see this) so I've started to just ignore the apologies in case my forgiveness isn't strong enough for him.

I know this is an anxiety response. I have anxiety too. (Along with depression, BPD, and PTSD. Nice little cocktail). But the dude refuses to take medication or see a therapist or do anything that would help him out here. And I can't cut him out without losing my friend, too. They are essentially attached at the hip. I'm scared that one day I'm going to really snap at him and lose my childhood friend in the process.

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I ignored any and all apologetic advances? Physical included

c2n95h	2019-06-19 21:51:21	tHr0wAw_AyAcCoUnT	WIBTA if I call someone a hypocrite?	So, the title is vague, but hear me out. I know a person and they always talk about how having a relationships when you are a teen is meaningless because you are a teen, you don't know what love is, so when those teens say 'i love you' it's meaningless and stupid and you should wait. We have a friend who does this and also has a lot of drama around guys and has different relationships every month or so and she says it is ridiculous and judges our mutual friend for it. She also says drama is stupid. It's not about the fact that I diagree with her, not at all. (For the most part, I don't) But, she (F16) also had relationships when she was thirteen, even younger and talked to me about drama and how this guy did this and that one did that, etc. Teenage drama. And I think that people can change their opinions and make mistakes. But, she now has an online boyfriend and has had around three or so (as far as I know)? (All online) A couple of months back she was talking about how she really loved this (online) dude and that she was sad he got a gf (irl or online, idk). I comforted her, because she is a good friend of mine. This also bugged me a little because she is always talking about how you can't love a guy when you are so young. I ignored it, because it's her life and if she wants to love a guy, whatever. Now, maybe two weeks later she had drama with this other dude she said she loved so much, but not relationship-wise and dated him anyway (online). They broke up after a week and now she is with her current (online) boyfriend. I ask her reguarly how their relationship is and she says fine and I ask how her boyfriend is and she says fine. And when I ask her; what do you like about him or something related to that she answers with; 'He's okay, I like him'. But, she also says it's online 'so who cares' she doesn't actually really like him. She is doing the exact thing she judges others for. I feel conflicted. It is her life. I don't care that she wants to date x amount of guys, but if she judges our mutual friend for doing so I feel like that is hypocritical. I want to confront her about it? I want to say that she is being hypocritical and that I don't care that she does this, but then she should stop judging our mutal friend and talk bad about her. Should I do so or should I mind my own fucking bussines? WIBTA if I tell her she is a hypocrite?	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2n8mg	2019-06-19 21:50:16	TheWooOoOoorst264	AITA for trying to organise my best friends hen party far in advance to give her a great weekend	"Title edit: AITA for asking everyone to pay the same price for a hen weekend even if they chose to only stay one night instead of two.


So standard apologies about formatting as I’m on my phone.

My best friend of a decade is finally getting married in June 2020, she’s already asked me and 3 other friends to be bridesmaids which is great and with that comes the wonderful task of trying to organise her hen party.

So myself and one of the other girls have tried to get ahead of the game and get some quotes for accommodation and activities to do for the weekend away, we’ve asked the bride what her idea of a perfect hen do would be and we are trying to give that to her.  We’ve got a group message for all things hen party related (not including the bride as we want there to be some surprises) and tried to get a rough idea of what people would be able to do, eg. 2 nights away, only one night etc as some of the hens are mums 

We’ve found the perfect accommodation which provides food, wine, club entry and transfers but it is priced on a per person basis for the whole weekend of £170. I put this to the group and said if you are able to come it will be a yes or no and the price will not vary depending on how many nights you stay as it is quoted on a flat rate, all we would need is a 20% deposit to secure the booking. 

Well, one bridesmaid has an extreme problem with paying for this when she may only be coming for one night and thinks those staying for both nights should pick up the extra cost which would mean paying more than the £170, I’ve said that the price is non-negotiable and no matter how long you stay the price is the same for everyone. 

Everyone else has been very understanding and realises how much planning goes into organising a weekend away with 15 people. One person has said she can’t do both nights so won’t come, but will celebrate closer to home on another date. 

So Reddit, AITA for asking everyone to pay the flat rate and saying it’s up to them if they chose to stay for one night or the whole weekend or to just not come and for asking this 11 months in advance 

Edit: I’m not asking anyone to pay just yet, just getting the numbers so we can book the correct sized cottage."	No A-holes here	0	0
c2n8ge	2019-06-19 21:49:55		AITA for going off on my flatmate?	"I (18M) live in a student flat with 5 other students, 4 of them I get along with, 1 of them I do not. We'll call her A (18F).

A I feel is a very manipulative individual. She's one of these people where everything she does isn't geared towards anyond but herself and her own personal gain. As in if she does a favour for you, you'd best believe she won't let you forget it when it comes to using it as leverage for you to do things for her. For example one day she asked me to come shopping with her and I said I was studying (which I was) and her response was ""But I go shopping EVERY TIME you do! I'm way too nice to you."" 

She'll also make these really fucking weird comments everytime she does a favour like if I borrow her milk after asking her for it she'll say some bullshit like ""I'm too nice to you"" or ""I'm such a good person"" it just gets really fucking annoying and frankly pretty absurd. 

She also went to Africa one time to help some kids with education or some bullshit I don't even know, but the point is that she ALWAYS fucking talks about it. Like anytime she can she goes ""Oh when I went to Ghana to help these kids out blah blah"" you get the point. Just another example of everything she does is for clout and nothing else. 

Not to mention she leaves all of her shit around the place, doesn't wash her dishes, never takes the bins out or shit like that. Another thing that pissed me off was I broke up with my gf recently and I kept it pretty private cause I was pretty upset about it, eventually I told a couple people about it and she found out via them and her words to me were ""Why didn't you tell me first?"" like bitch WHY THE FUCK WOULD I TELL YOU FIRST? All she could think about in that situation is how disrespectful it was that I told people before her. Also worth mentioning that it's not just me: everyone's opinion in the flat is that she's a manipulator and a rat. 

So here's the actual AITA: the final straw came the other day after a few weeks of me pretty much ignoring her entirely when she said to one of my other flatmates some more bullshit about Africa and how amazing she was for doing it. For some reason I just snapped and said ""A, maybe if you were such a helping hand like you claim you are, you wouldn't fucking go on about how much of a helping hand you are all the time."". 

Now full disclosure I pretty much never snap like this, usually when I get super angry I just keep it to myself and avoid the individual until I've calmed down to avoid confrontation, so this was very out of character for me. A then stormed out after calling me a dick and locked herself in her room. 

Part of me wants to apologise but the other part of me feels that if I were to apologise that just wouldn't be honest of me because I don't actually FEEL sorry because I meant every word.

My(22f) boyfriend and I recently broke up. It wasn't awesome, but it was relatively amicable, and we're hoping we can work towards being friends in the future. 

I told my parents about the split and some general info on why. I'd like to make it clear that *my parents are not close with this ex*
He's been home with me twice for a visit (my parents and I live 200 miles away from each other) and has seen them maybe twice when they've visited me. Everyone got along, but no special bonds were formed. 

Small backstory: my mom has a history of overstepping bounds. Growing up she would highlight passages of my journal and question me on them, to give you an idea. A while back, she called me, must've thought there was something wrong (she asked, there wasn't, I was fine) didn't like my tone, and messaged my bf on Facebook to see if something was up. Asked him not to tell me she did it. He told me, my dad had a chat with her about overstepping boundaries, but told me I wouldn't be getting an apology because it ""wasn't her strong suit""

Fast forward to 2 days post-breakup, she messages my ex again to tell him how heartbroken she is, sends her condolences, tells him she hopes he can find someone new, etc. It makes him uncomfortable, he mentions it to me, it makes me livid. I give her a call, tell her it was inappropriate, that it made both of us uncomfortable, and asked why she thought that would be ok. She gets mad, has my dad ream me out for it. He yelled at me and demanded I apologize. I told him I wouldn't because it isn't my strong suit, if my own mother can't ever apologize to me why should I have to, and i'm not sorry to begin with. They maintain that ex and I are overreacting, that I need to apologize, and that the ""youths of today need to stop being so uncomfortable.""

c2n6wb	2019-06-19 21:46:36	meAndDearWife	WIBTA Would we(me&dearWife) be the assholes for not wanting to go on a free vacation with my mother?	"A couple of months ago, while we were visiting my sister and her family, I remarked how nice it would be to go on vacation together, their kids and our daughter could then play together etc.

My mother was present, so I guess that's why the following whatsapp group announcement was made by her yesterday:

""meAndDearWife, last time you were at sisters place, you said it would be nice to go on a vacation together, that's why I and your sister booked these two cottages for a week. You can come too, but there's one catch: you'll have to share a roof with me and your dad.""

&#x200B;

Now, me and my dear wife have been thinking this over a LOT. And we are not in ANY way willing to share a roof with my mother. We don't want to be judged by her. And she is going to if we do share a roof with her. There is a longer backstory that doesn't fit in here.

The other thing that is bothering us is my mothers total disregard for me and my wife as a family. Judging by the original messages text, my mother didn't consider at all to ask me or my wife whether we'd like to come and rent our own cottage where we can enjoy that week in our own pace if we so please.

&#x200B;

I work in Hugo boss and basically we get commission, I make a LOT of money because I always exceed target. Both my parents are uni lecturers and I’m also in uni. 

I’m saving for my dream car and I have around £20k in funds. I have no debt other than uni debt which I’ll be able to easily pay off anyway. 

My gf of 3 years has been getting really insistent lately that I use that money to buy a house. I don’t really want to do that and I’m starting to dodge her calls because since she found out about it she won’t leave it alone and it comes up in every single conversation even when I’ve told her no. 

I’d say we are close, I reckon she’s the 1st lass I’ve ever actually been in love with and she’s a lot more sensible than me but I just really can’t seem to make her understand this isn’t happening. She called me again last week and I told her not to start about the house thing again. She slammed the phone down on me and hasn’t texted me since even though I’ve tried to call her. We live in different parts of the country and uni is finished for the year but I don’t see the point in driving to her if she doesn’t even want to talk to me.

"So I (18F) have a friend (20M) who was recently hospitalized for depression and released after a couple days. I saw him shortly after he was out and he was still the same person I knew before- super chill, etc. We share a music taste so I invited him to come to a concert with me and another mutual friend and probably end up meeting some of my other friends there. He agrees and everything seems like a plan. I buy all the tickets with the expectation that everyone will pay me back whenever. 

Fast foreword a few days to the next time I see him, and he is a COMPLETELY different person. Nails painted black (not that there is anything wrong with that, just out of character), insanely impulsive, rambling, super extroverted with strangers and just totally weird. He is in a full blown state of mania, delusional, lacking all social/self awareness and making changes to the way he dresses, and other antics not worth getting into. To put it bluntly; literally acting like a crazy person (Talking with his step brother confirmed that the family suspects this behavior is due to the new antidepressants).

To be honest, this freaks me out and makes me super uncomfortable and unsure on how to deal with him. The mutual friend going to the concert with us hung out with him the other day and was also incredibly concerned and freaked out. We don’t plan to shut him out of our lives at all, but are hesitant to be solely responsible for him in public while he is in that state and maybe even a little second hand embarrassment and we want to enjoy ourselves too. 

He is so all over the place that I’m not even sure he would notice if he missed the concert... he also hasn’t payed me for the ticket or anything yet. 

I assume this is part of adjusting to his meds/they will be adjusted eventually and I totally understand that people don’t typically stay in this state forever, however WIBTA if (some how), assuming he is still acting abnormal, I uninvite him, whether it be directly or a with a white lie, from coming with us?

UPDATE: no one really asked for but seems relevant to further replies. I heard that his mother is giving him until Friday (2 days) to normalize then will be taking him into the doctor. I still think this is waiting way too long but I’m at loss of what to do, I might head over to his house tmo to hangout with him and a few others and hope to have a moment to talk to one of his family members about it."

I had my headphones on so she couldn’t hear the music but she said the clacking of the keys was so loud she couldn’t sleep.

c2n002	2019-06-19 21:31:06	fwilliams13	AITA for not sending what little money I have, to my long lost brother?	"A little backstory, my brother is in his early 30s (maybe 31) and I am 25. I have never met him, because we were separated during the civil war in Liberia. I was around 2 years old when my mother had to flee to Ghana to seek refugee status and hopefully make it to America and start a life. She did not know where my older sister or older brother were, and could do nothing about it. We were able to come to the U.S and our lives began, just my mother and I. Fast forward a couple years, and my mother hasn't heard about her children. Liberia was starting to come back together so she attempted to reach out to family and locate her children. No luck. Fast forward a couple more years, and we finally get in  contact with some of my family who knew where my older sister is. She was 16 when she first came to the US and if I remember correctly, I was 12ish. Fast forward to maybe 2015, and it has long been presumed that my older brother was dead since we have had zero luck finding him. But then, out of pure luck, he shows up. Someone recognized him, and got him in contact with my mother via Facebook. I didn't know how to feel. My whole life I mourned my brother and felt like I was missing so much in my life knowing that I would never know him. Then when he was found, I didn't know what to do. I thought I would this overwhelming feeling of happiness, but it was quite the opposite. I felt nothing. When I finally got to speak to him for the first time in my life, our conversation was weird and it didn't feel like my brother I was talking to, but a complete stranger, which of course I know why I would feel that way. I kept talking to him and trying to learn more about his life, etc. and it just never did it for me. I never felt that connection, and just didn't know why. Then the conversations started turning towards money. He has been asking me for money and I can't say that I make enough to not be paycheck to paycheck while trying to get on my feet and be stable. So I cant help him without feeling even more broke than I am now. I feel so bad because I know he had it so much worse than me, but I feel like I would be bending over backwards for who is essentially a total stranger to me. It's so hard to not feel guilt and I can't figure out what to do because he gets upset when I tell him I don't have enough money to support him. He believes that since I am in America, I am living the dream and I'm being selfish not helping him out. I just feel lost and don't know how to feel. I have very little family that I know, and I can't even get help when I need it. I have a child and I am married and have them to support.

So I don't know Reddit, AITA?

c2mzsz	2019-06-19 21:30:39		AITA for insisting all of my fiancé’s groomsmen get a rental tux?	"My fiancé and I are getting married at the end of August. Today, we went to a menswear store to get the tuxedo rentals sorted out. It came out that for tux (which includes jacket, shirt, tie, vest, pocket square, pants, belt, socks, and shoes) it will be $230. I’m very unfamiliar with the pricing of these things, but it seemed on par since my bridesmaid dresses were $170 before alterations (and the men also don’t have to get hair and make up). Even so, not everyone in our wedding is in the same financial situation as we are, so I did tell my fiancé to let his groomsmen know if they can’t afford it right away, let me know and I can pay for it and they can pay me back later. 

We also got a deal that if my fiancé gets 6 rentals, the store will give him a custom suit for free. He has 6 groomsmen, so this seemed really great for us. My fiancé has recently lost about 30lbs and doesn’t currently have a suit that fits him. 

One of his groomsmen then let it be known that instead of renting, he wanted to buy a suit to match the others. He said he had already intended on doing so because he also needs a new suit. He said that it seemed dumb to spend so much money on a rental when he could buy something similar for the same price. 

I’m not ok with this (and neither is my fiancé). For me, I’d like everyone to look the same, especially for pictures. Suits are different than tuxes and unless he went in and bought the exact same thing as the rental, I’m going to be able to tell a difference. 

My fiancé is more so not ok with it because he was really excited about getting a new suit. He did let the groomsman know this was part of his reason for saying no, and that he apologized if it was selfish but this is what he planned on doing from the get go. He also reiterated that if the rental is too much money, we have no issue with covering a part of the cost. Reiterating this even seemed a bit ridiculous to me because this particular persons salary is public record and he makes a lot of money and lives a pretty lavish lifestyle.

So, AITA for insisting all the groomsmen wear the same thing? I don’t want to be a bridezilla, but at the end of the day I want my wedding to be how I pictured it.

I was on a gas station and there were few of people in front of me including a girl (22-25?). 2 punks cut the queue and tell the girl to back off and let them fill first. She went ahead anyway.
One of them got off the bike, went in front of the girl and started cat calling her in third person while talking to his bitch ass accomplice ""look at her eyes, man"" ""she's so fine"" etc. Then the two exchange their position. Other one cat calls here in the same manner. The girl was visibly shaken by this and left as soon as possible.

All this while there were 5 other people all men, and nobody, including me, said a word. I was fuming but the guys already looked like trouble and I didn't want any to come my way. The woman left and they started to joke about it. I had had enough by this point and I yelled at them ""oii, what do you think you are doing? Don't you have a mother?"" I was wearing a helmet so I'm not sure if he heard me but he briefly looked at me and left. I talked to the fuel station guy about it and he said that nobody enjoyed what they saw and everybody was fuming but the girl didn't protest herself so he couldn't have done anything.

I'm really disappointed in myself after this incident for not standing up. 
On one side, I think that I did the practical thing by not indulging in it since I was alone and there were two of them. I've heard that some woman don't own up to the events and they bail out and you are stuck by yourself. But this argument falls apart when I assume that once I would've protested more would've joined in.

On the other side, I think had I protested earlier rather than after the girl left, I would've saved some mental toll on her. She left knowing that no one uttered a single word.

I have never traveled outside the country, yet always wanted to.

I decided to hold off a trip for a while. About 4 months of my dad at home, I told my mom I am going on a trip, she started saying how I am evil for even thinking of going on a vacation after knowing my dad has cancer. I didn't go on vacation then. Now its been a whole year, and I secretly booked a trip a month ago and didn't tell my family. Trip is scheduled in 2 months and il be gone for 2 weeks. Though the same week I booked the trip, my dad got admitted to the hospital, and my family were saying oh its nothing serious and he'll be back home in a couple days. I visit him multiple times a week. Its been a month that I keep visiting him in the hospital and hes looking worse and worse, with my family still saying oh everything is going normal its almost done etc. If the situation continues like this to the date of my departure, would I be an asshole for leaving my family for 2 weeks to enjoy the views and culture of a foreign country?

c2mvql	2019-06-19 21:21:41	AnonInDisguise	WIBTA for asking my friend to be kicked out of our D&D campaign?	"So me and my friends have this D&D campaign. We used to play months before, but eventually ended it because no-one took it seriously anymore, and those who wanted to take it seriously got tired of the other side.

We have recently re-started playing, with some friends gone and some new ones in. We're all 18-22 years. There is this one particular friend (lets call him X) from the old campaign still with us though....

Now he is OBNOXIOUS and both the DM and my fiancee agree with it (my fiancee stopped playing all together because of his acting.). X doesn't listen, if someone points something out he has the absolute NEED to repeat it to the point people have to tell him to shut up and focus, or get to the point. 

We have addressed the issue to him before, and he refuses to change. Our group chat was immediately filled with ""I can't change this is how I am. Even the doctors say so. I can't do anything right, you guys just don't like me. Woe is me for not being able to control myself because I have aspergers and adhd.""

For context, alongside X there is a boy I will call Y who also has aspergers. Y tried his best to give him advice and tell him how he copes with his condition, and tried to share tips and tricks on bettering himself from one aspergers patient to another during this confrontation. X refused all of it with even more ""I'm just broken because of my condition there is nothign I can do to change myself or the way I act."" I've known him for 5+ years and he's always been this way. 

We are getting really tired of it, and our DM is planning on quitting again because of this. I'm just worried it would make me a backstabbing asshole for asking to kick him from the game."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2mv4h	2019-06-19 21:20:19		Aita for asking a question?	"Im 20...female...yadda, yadda.


There is a class im not doing well in. Its hard for me to grasp the material, even with me studying hard as hell. Im averaging a fucking 51%. Im not doing well at all, and i understand that. Each Mon and Weds we have a lab. In that lab I ask questions when I dont understand things, but the way my teacher answers questions is bizarre. I swear she talks way over my head to make a point and It really gets me upset, even when I tell her that I dont understand her explanations. Today was way more intense. 

I asked a question. And damn maybe I shouldnt have. She took the pen from me, forcefully and drew out a fucking map to get me to understand it. I STILL didnt and by now im starting to get visually frustrated. I guess my teacher picks this up as me being ""disrespectful"" to her and blows her shit at me. Im honestly confused? I asked a question because I obviously want to know the answer. I care about my grade, lol, im an idiot ik but at least im trying! She asks me more questions and since I didnt know the answer to the first one I definitely have no idea about how to answer these. She gets even angrier! By then im squirming in my seat. Its completely silent except for her asking me these questions! The vibe is very aggressive and I honestly dont know what to do.

Im an anxious, depressed individual. Things get to me very quickly. Once she finished, my hands were shaking. I was humiliated as fuck. Once she moved on, I asked to speak with her in private. She seemed angry I even wanted to speak with her! I asked if i did anything wrong and she said I took out my frustration her. I was taken aback, how in the hell did i do that if i genuinely dont understand shit you're saying!? Me telling her i dont get it made her upset at me! She lays into me, saying how i should go to tutoring and other shit like that, loud as hell so everyone can hear. It felt very unprofessional and I honestly felt humilated. I left the room in silence. Once i got to my car, i broke down. can someone on reddit tell me if i was the asshole in this situation? This is college so I know things are different but if i did something wrong Ill own up to it. Make amends, apologize, whatever. I know I sound whiny and childlike, and thats cause, well, i can be at times, but im confused about this time.

TLDR: My mom always talks about the problems that her and my dad has to me, and I kinda want to tell her this is the reason why I don’t like talking about my problems to her.


My parents have been like since marriage, they always fought about the little things. Such as, saying a joke and then the other takes it the wrong way. When I was attending middle school, my mom started talking about the problems they have. Sometimes my dad complains about my mom. But they never solve anything between them, they just ignore each other and then “make up.”

To try to make this story short, after my mom talks about her problems, sometimes she tells me. “I’m not saying this to make you feel bad, but I just need someone to talk to or else I’m going to explode.” But it really does make me feel bad since they are my parents and I love them dearly. I also don’t want to choose sides not decide who is on the right or wrong. And I’m at the point to say that this is the reason why I don’t want to talk about my problems because I don’t want them to feel bad for me. Nor do I like to talk my boyfriend because of how you guys act. I honestly wish they could talk about their problems and sort things out by themselves.

c2mt15	2019-06-19 21:15:36	throwaway827484G	AITA for body shaming a camgirl? (Possibly NSFW)	"PLEASE READ THE STORY AND DON'T JUDGE JUDT BASED ON THE TOPIC LINE.

I do browse cam sites occasionally. I was browsing around one and found a very attractive girl tagged as a BBW. She was big but blessed, the weight went all to the right places, no hanging rolls, just plump curves. She also listed herself as a sub in her bio. We talked and I proposed degrading her as a sub, she was like ""oh I'd love that!"" and I came up with the scenario she roleplay as a prostitute, me as a client, and I'm not happy with her size so I insult her and pretend to have sex with her in a degrading way and insult her weight. That's what we did, I got off, she seemed to have a blast and enjoyed it the entire time, I tipped her and logged off.

I logged on again a few days later and was interested in that again, so I went to the BBW section of the site. I found another girl I found I very attractive and started chatting. She was interested, then when I asked if I could degrade and weight shame her in a private show she flat out called me a shitty person and blocked me. It hurt.

Was I a dick for wanting this? Remember that I would never do it non-consensually or outside of a roleplay scenario. If I ever got the first girl in my bedroom wanting to have sex I'd be going crazy at the opportunity, not insulting her. I wouldn't be offended by a girl just saying no either. Asshole thing?"

c2mqoi	2019-06-19 21:09:58	joltl111	AITA for silently ignoring a friend?	"So since I was 11 (I'm 16, male) I had this friend Joe (obviously not his real name) whom I, at the time, considered to be one of my best friends. The bummer with the situation, is that and his family had immigrated to Belgium, so we'd only hang out when he returned home on Summer/Christmas(etc.) breaks from school back to Lithuania (where we're from). It was an awesome friendship for about 3-4 years. We'd do so much together and we pretty much had identical personalities - both very outgoing, LOUD, and extroverted. We'd have fun by doing either something completely stupid, like chasing each other with water hoses (and I legit have a scar to prove it), forcing each other to touch the nastiest thing we could find around, or something generally interesting, like using movie editing software to make ridiculous short films or design an obstacle course for each other and see, who can beat it faster (we're kinda nerds if you haven't picked up yet🙂)

So now let's skip by 4 years. I'm now 15, and meeting him after an almost 6 month break, and my personality hadn't changed a bit. His however had. It's like he turned into a goddamn professor. 

(And mind you, I'm considered to be quite intelligent by all of my teachers, and I've been called a nerd since grade one)

But COME ON. When I go hang out, I want to have fun, make lasting memories and be around a fellow teen, not a younger version of a philospher. He only wanted to talk about some psychological and philosophical subjects, and when suggested a more fun topic, he tried to change it immediately. 

So after a very forced and, to be honest, not enjoyable week, he went back to Belgium. This exact same type of interaction happened like two or three more times. The last time we met, I mentally forced myself to do it, and, well, the interaction was just as forced and boring.

So now comes in the asshole part. Recently (aka since last Christmas) I began ignoring him. Not responding to texts, not hanging up calls and just generally trying to pretend he doesn't exist. I've contemplated confronting him and being honest, but I just can't force myself to do it. He is a very awesome person, who'll definitely achieve great things in the future, so I don't want to totally distance myself from him. 

How bad of an asshole am I here? I know, that the right thing to do, is to lay it all out, but the idea of that in my head comes across as a AH HELL NO! NO WAY AM I DOING THAT! 
It scares the absolute living shit out of me. It's like Harry telling Ron, that he doesn't want him to be his friend anymore (that's a Harry Potter reference btw (remember the I'm a nerd part :D)). But on the other hand, just ignoring him for the rest of my life seems like something only Draco would do. 

Please, I don't know who to turn to, since everybody's opinion in my family about him is fantastic, and since we didn't meet through school, an after school club, etc., we don't have mutual friends. What do you think?"	Asshole	0	0

It all started 2 months back when my daughter was playing some running game with her friends that he saw her and started running behind her and kept holding her hands for 30 minutes straight even though she tried to jerk his hand away many times and then he started plucking flowers from our garden and gave her literally like 30 flowers.

And a few days back my daughter was going to her house to meet her and he decided to go meet her too and my matter told me that her friend was about to go have a shower and my son ran towards the bathroom to see her and started banging the door when she was closing it 

Now he wants to invite her for his birthday parry on the 25th when on the other children he wants to invite are male and his age,I told him that he can't  invite her and since then he has been upset,I just don't want to make that girl feel uncomfortable.

Ever since I met my friend she said  her mom had been killed my her father. That’s all I knew about it, that and where it took place. I never doubted it was true since she lives with another family member and have never seen her parents. I’m a true crime person and very curious and did some searching. After two months I found the police report and full story. I haven’t told her and won’t, but I feel so guilty for not letting her tell me on her own time. Maybe it’s not a huge deal, but I probably should have waited. In the moment I forgot how she wouldn’t say much and kept it private. I feel so guilty and just AITA?

c2mppm	2019-06-19 21:07:46	glide_on	WIBTA if I shaved my head despite my husband's wishes?	"Little background information: Due to chemical processing, my hair started thinning years ago. I'm very self-conscience about it at this point. Any hairstyle or haircut I get really doesn't look good. It might not look BAD, but it definitely isn't great. It's got to the point I don't even want to go out because of my hair. I don't look in mirrors. 

&#x200B;

For a job interview, I bought a wig, and it was like seeing the old me for the first time in forever. I've never felt so good about myself in my life. I could stand looking at myself in the mirror. I've since bought a wig I love that is exactly how I've always wanted my hair.

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I'm at now. I live in southeast Georgia. It's hotter than a crackhead's crack pipe. I mean, you walk outside and just want to turn back around and go in screeching, ""NOPE."" So, if you consider the hair that I DO have, a wig cap (stocking cap basically), and a wig with actual HAIR... it gets hot as HELL. Scalp sweat SUCKS.

&#x200B;

So, I've been thinking about shaving my head. My husband (who enjoys seeing me in wigs) does not think I should do so. I was talking to him yesterday and mentioned it. He said no basically. Now, I'm really not ASKING his permission by any means, but I mean he has to look at me so I'll ask. There may be times I don't have a wig on sure. But, the point is I want to wear it all the time. Since he enjoys seeing me in wigs, I specifically went out and picked out a color I knew he loved (he loves me with red hair).

&#x200B;

When we were laying down in bed, I mentioned it again, and he said something along the lines of, ""I won't be sleeping with you then."" I reminded him of his receding hairline and two could play that game. Then asked him how it made him feel. He didn't get mad, but he didn't say anything else. But the issue wasn't resolved because I was like ""Fuck it. I'm rolling over and playing on my phone."" I was super tired lol. It didn't make me mad, though. It takes a lot to make me head, but I still want to do it ... 

&#x200B;

Also, since I still have hair, I put it into a small tiny ponytail/bun thing, and stuff it inside the wig which gives it a bump in the back... and actually makes it tighter on my head. And I'm afraid people can notice the bump, which defeats the purpose of wearing the wig to feel confident about myself.

&#x200B;

The only cons to it I can think of are my husband not liking it. 

&#x200B;

I'm really tired of worrying about what others think and doing what they think is best. I don't want to feel like I have to ask permission to do something with my hair/my body, but I understand it's an extreme move. And I get it. You don't want to sleep next to me with a shaved head and look at it. I respect that totally. But, also you married ME... good hair, bad hair, shaved head, and all. You're supposed to love me for me. I'm doing this for ME.

If I don’t get this screw, the hubcap will stay on, it just looks better with the screw in it. 

I just got these rims and the guy came up to me and said they couldn’t find the final screw. Okay, no problem. Well upon further inspection, it looks like they broke the screw off in there but didn’t tell me.

Most people would say that I should automatically take it in but here’s the dilemma. It took a while to get these rims in, so the manager gave me two free rims out of this deal that he refunded me. They gave back quite a lot of money. 

So, I don’t want to go up there and have them laugh at me for this issue. I don’t want to be one of those people that whine and cry about everything but this is my new rim! I’d like to just have all of the screws and I can’t even put a new one in because it won’t fit because of the broken one.

c2mory	2019-06-19 21:05:36	import-numpy	AITA for jokingly comparing my dad to Hitler?	"Last night at dinner my mom told my wife the following, with some paraphrasing for clarification: ""You know, even though our son didn't have the best father growing up, you should still thank us because your husband wouldn't exist without us.""

&#x200B;

To which I answered: ""You should also thank Hitler since without him my Jewish grandparents would have never met.""

&#x200B;

My mom, who is the daughter of said holocaust survivors, didn't appreciate my comment and called me an Idiot. 

&#x200B;

My mom's comment didn't come out of nowhere. For the last two weeks my family, wife and 2 young sons, have been road tripping with my parents all over the US. They came to visit us from a different country. At some point last week my 9 yo had a meltdown in a restaurant that required me to take him outside where he could play out his tantrum. Being familiar with my son, I know there is no reasoning with him when he is that wound up and that he just needed to calm down on his own terms. My dad felt it was necessary to comment that his kids (aka me and my siblings) would never behave that way because of the way he raised us, implying that I'm parenting wrong.

&#x200B;

That opened up Pandora's box which I was trying very hard, for the better part of the trip, to keep shut.

&#x200B;

My dad was an awful father. He constantly threatened us with physical violence and some times he would hit us over the stupidest shit. He was extremely controlling and made us feel like we can't do anything without him.  In addition to all that, he was, and still is at times,  verbally abusive to my mother. I still vividly remember him smashing a plate of food on the floor that my mom served him because he was upset about what he was being served. He is correct that I would never act like my 9 yo. Because I was afraid of him. But at the same time, I hated my dad most of my childhood. I didn't love my dad and still struggle with it some days. I love my kids and the relationship we have which is built upon mutual respect.

&#x200B;

In my mind, my mom implying that my dad is not so bad because he made me is the same as saying that we should thank Hitler since I would never have existed without his actions.

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole?

EDIT: I’m going to try to further explain the “joke” though I doubt it will change any minds. My grandparents literally met as a result of the holocaust, meaning that my mom would not exist if it didn’t occur, and by extension, I myself would not exist. My mom saying that my wife should thank them and overlook my problematic childhood made me think about an example that would illustrate to her how ridiculous she was being."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

In 2015 my best friend, let's call her Jos, moved several states away. Since then, we've kind of drifted apart, as in we'll call each other maybe 4-5 times a year but when we talk it's like no time has passed. Both of us are really, really bad at life - we both have depression and anxiety issues that make friendships hard. Neither of us blame the other when it takes us 3 weeks to respond to a text, and we're pretty supportive of each other and I know Jos would drop everything and fly out if I ever really needed her. It goes both ways. But now we hardly ever talk and I don't feel as close to her as I used to, but I still love her like a sister.

When I got engaged she was the first person I told (because I wanted to tell my parents in person). I immediately asked her to be my Maid of Honor.

Now there is someone in town, let's call her Mary, who I've known just as long but who I spend a lot of time with, like getting together for lunch 2-3 times a month. Recently I asked Mary to be a bridesmaid. I'm thinking about either making her my Maid of Honor or only having bridesmaids and having my brother stand at my side during the ceremony.

My ‘partner’ is never here and when he is he roars at the dogs and feeds them human food. Which then leaves me with all the mess he never cleans as he hardly here. 

Last night one of the dogs had explosive poops in my room. Was up at 2 until 4 in the morning cleaning it. Then up at 6 again to let it out to go again. 

This isn’t the first time this is happened. I really love them but they need a family who can walk them daily and have more time for them. 

Said to ‘partner’ what I just said above. He calling me every name under the sun and said if they go he goes. I really couldn’t care less about him. 

He also said if I could do it with the kids I would. So I blocked him on everything before things really got heated.

c2mgcn	2019-06-19 20:45:21	joyleaf	WIBTA by quitting my job today (with no notice) because they wouldn't give me a day off?	"Hi folks, I feel like the asshole, but at the same time there's a lot behind this.


I currently have 3 resignation letters in my bag: no notice, 1 day notice (I still work tomorrow's shift), and 2 weeks (in the event they give me Saturday off in exchange for not quitting immediately, but I still quit). 


This is a restaurant job. When hired, I was supposed to receive a week of training in various roles. I got 2 hours of training for 1 role, and was immediately thrown into working multiple positions after that. I've been working here about 1.5 months now.


They are understaffed, but instead of hiring more people they're having me do multiple jobs (I do Take Out, but they make me host and serve at the same time, too) for the pay of 1. I'm consistently scheduled for 1 role when the schedule is posted, and my managers then ask me for a ""favor"" at the start of each shift to work multiple roles.


Other people often no-call no-show, or they call out maybe an hour before their shift saying ""I won't be there,"" and get off the hook with no repercussions. 


---- 


My sister surprised us and is in town for the first time in 2 years, and my family is organizing something on Saturday to celebrate. I thought I'd do the normal thing and ask for it off (2 days ago), rather than call out or not show up. 


My manager told me no, but the thing is is that I work so hard at this job for less pay than I've made anywhere else. Several people have also quit because of similar or other unfair treatment.  They all tell me quite often that they see how hard I work. I ask questions to learn about other roles, help other staff when I can with anything, and always make sure I'm always busy doing something (""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean""). I'm also very often stressed from this job because it's also a 2 hour trip for me to get there from home, and I'm off late at night, making it all very draining.


So, frankly, I'm pretty upset they couldn't grant me this one day off. 


Take out at this restaurant on Saturdays during my shift is also notoriously slow, and before me one of the managers would do it or a half server would. That role alone is relatively easy, it's just not with 2 other roles on top of it. So, it wouldn't be anywhere near chaotic for me to not be there (they schedule enough people on Saturdays so I wouldn't be doing multiple roles that day). 


I'm getting another job regardless. I was originally going to work 2 jobs, but seeing as I'll be making significantly more at this new place I see it as I should just quit. I also even have another job that's been offered, so regardless I'm safe. 


So, will I be the asshole?


Tldr: Restaurant has been overworking me and won't give me a day off despite others constantly no call/no showing or calling in late. I have another job lined up, and I'm ready to quit today with no notice so I can get that day off. Will that make me the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My fiancee's friend invited us to the lake this weekend with her boyfriend and some other people. I can't stand her friend. She's rude and talks over people. She also constantly complains about her personal problems that are self induced through her own ridiculous decision making. 


Couple of examples: Driving home drunk because someone wouldn't give her a ride from a bar and didn't want to pay for Uber. 


Breaking up with her boyfriend every week over ridiculous things. 


She put in her two weeks notice at work 3 times and withdrew it each time within a month because she was going to move back home. Conveniently enough it matched the times her and her boyfriend broke up.


I love my fiancee more than anything. Admittedly she has a tough time making friends. This is one of her only ones and she loves the lake and has been wanting to go prior to the invite. I have never been able to tolerate more than 10 minutes of her friend without being on the verge of going off on her. Now I may have to spend a whole day with her.


My fiancee will not go alone. She loves couples things like this and she would just feel left out if I didn't go.

c2mee9	2019-06-19 20:40:53		WIBTA if I told my good friend why my other friends and most people who meet him do not like them?	"I have a friend, let’s call them Derek. Derek is a good friend of mine and has been for 5-7 years now.

Derek talks a lot. Sometimes it’s almost like he is having a conversation with himself when he is talking to other people. But  he has cool interests, seems to look into a lot of things and get as much info on them as possible. Loves sharing new things he likes with anyone who is willing to listen. When he does this though he is very pretentious about it.

For the years I have known Derek I have tried to introduce him to other great people in my life and literally all of them have told me they don’t like Derek. The feedback I have heard is that he comes off as pretentious, rude, and obnoxious to be around. This is feedback whether we are sober or drinking/under other substances. But the complaints seems to be greater when it involves substances.

 He does seem to know people think he is pretentious as he overheard one of my friends say it to another one night we were out socializing. He thinks this is the only reason people don’t like him and can’t really grasps how most people can’t overlook it like I do.

When I hang out with Derek he can be those things but they don’t usually bother me because all of his good usually outweighs all this. I won’t go into a lot of detail about this but my dad’s health is not good at all as he battles a disease and deals with the complications from it. Derek always asks me how he is doing, reaches out to me randomly to make sure things are still going okay for me and my family. Has been a sounding board for me at times. To me he has been a good friend who has shared his cool interests with me and helped me find things I never thought I would like and helped me grow as a person.

Derek does have a bit of an issue with substances. When he drinks he gets blacked out, when he smokes he smokes all the weed, when he takes xan’s it is a lot to see how fucked up he can get. And when he is on substances his pretentiousness and all these things really come out and is multiplied to even greater heights. It got to the point where I told him I could not be around him while on Xan’s because it completely changed who he was as a person. Now when I told him not to be around me on Xan’s he said it hurt him. But did say he felt he needed to hear it.


We all have vices and we all use things as escapes. Sometimes it isn’t the healthiest of things for the individual but I try not to judge because I don’t know every aspect of that individuals life. But when he is using substances which happens a lot of the time he is almost unbearable. My girlfriend doesn’t want to go out and get drinks or do anything that involves alcohol with him because of the person he becomes. So WIBTA if I told my friend that yes people think he is pretentious but what really turns people off of him is that he is constantly under substances that seem to remove any self-control he has and it makes him a person no one desires to be around."		1	0

c2me4t	2019-06-19 20:40:17	hadtodoitonem	AITA for calling my sister out for being a bad mother	"so, i’m currently 18 and have an older sister who’s 4 years older than me. around the time i started transitioning into high school, she had found out that she was pregnant. with her boyfriend not being in the picture at the time, i was left as one of the primary people to take care of her child. of course, i was ecstatic, and had enthusiastically helped babysit my niece whenever needed. this usually ate up most of my time, and by the time she got a job, i was watching my niece more than 40 hours a week with no pay.

me having to watch her for the majority of my week got into the way of my academics, and it was really difficult to try to get a job myself or keep up with any extracurriculars. this continued throughout the entirety of my high school career, with me only starting to get paid around $1 an hour for the labor i did throughout the week.

this wouldn’t necessarily be an issue in itself if i was treated okay, especially since i know how expensive child care is. the issue is that she’s grown to feel entitled to my help. she often doesn’t take care of my nieces basic necessities, and will routinely “forget” to feed or bathe her. because of this, i have to constantly step in as a parent and take care of my nieces needs, along with doing recreational activities (painting, playing music, reading) with her.

fast forward to now, i’m about to be a sophomore in college and just got my first job. i was excited initially at the thought of this, but soon became really concerned for my nieces well being. my nieces father is slowly coming back into the picture, which made me more hopeful for her quality of care. unfortunately, my sister instead spends most of her time hanging out with him, not paying too much attention to my niece. even now, it isn’t rare for her not to feed or bathe my niece, and her “forgetting” to feed her breakfast this morning was my last straw. 

i angrily confronted her, claiming that she needs to own up to her responsibilities and become a better parent. this led her to jump on me and attack me, claiming that “i don’t have the right to talk to her like that”. my mom and her boyfriend separated us, and now my face is scratched up and we’re not on good terms. my mom says that way i approached it wasn’t okay, and that i should’ve went about it in a different way. i completely disagree due to my frustration, but i really do want to know if i actually was in the wrong."

"I was at my local boardgame store playing a game, probably around 20:30, this lady slowly walks in on crutches. She didn't look very well cared for. Her clothes were a bit ratty, her teeth were bad and her hair was a bit messy.

She approached me, probably because I was the first person to make eye contact, and said (in Afrikaans but I'm paraphrasing): ""I know this is a big ask, but I don't have one of these fancy phones. Would you be willing to book an Uber or a Taxify for me on cash?"" I don't recall her saying please.

I hesitated, which put her on edge, so when I said ""look, it's kind of a big deal"" she was ready with her retort.

""It's not a big deal really. I'll pay the guy, I just need you to book it."" I said I don't have one of these apps (which was a lie but my gut was telling me this woman isn't trustworthy) and she insisted that it's easy to install. For someone that didn't have a *fancy phone*, she seemed remarkably versed in what they can do. Anyway, at this point she was becoming a little aggressive and everyone else was listening.

""Look, if you don't do this I have to walk home,"" she said, lifting a crutch in case I hadn't noticed. I was about to say that if I book the lift, even with cash selected, and the driver doesn't get his pay, I'm the one that has to pay and it'll affect my ratings, but before I could say any of this she turned and walked out, now suddenly quite agile, alternating crutches instead of putting all her weight on them like before. She basically stormed out mumbling something about us being bad people.

The liquor store nextdoor had closed about half an hour earlier and their staff were walking past. One of the guys came in (he sometimes hangs out with us) and said that she was asking them to open the doors and sell her boose a few minutes after closing and they told her that they can have their license revoked if they did that, so clearly she was already in a bad mood when she came to us.

The people with me assured me that I did the right thing, that she looked unsavoury and it wasn't worth the risk, but more than a day later I wonder if maybe I did condemn this lady to making her way home in the dark on those crutches...

c2m9br	2019-06-19 20:30:06	wowmuchwowmuchwow	AITA for not asking girlfriend how’s she’s doing after mom had surgery (cancer)	So my (22 M) girlfriend (21f) of 3 years and I recently found out her mom has cancer about a month ago. Two days ago her mom had surgery to try to remove most of it and things were looking relatively positive from the initial diagnosis. I brought her mom flowers and a card after I got off of work and stayed with my girlfriend and mom at their house for support; this was two days ago. Yesterday, I had to do things for school and was busy all day and I was supposed to come visit at night but I picked up an early shift for work the next day and texted my girlfriend about it. She suggested I’d go to sleep instead of go over and after asking her multiple times if she was okay with it, we said goodnight. I noticed though that she was texting weird so I asked if she was okay and again, she said yes. Ended up that she texted me after about 15 minutes later saying that I don’t care about anything that is going on. So right off the bat I’m just shaken by what she said. I get defensive because it’s such a huge accusation and I had visited the day before. Her mom is like a second mom to me and I love her very much and I think about this situation all the time. But she told me that the reason she thinks I don’t care was because I didn’t ask her (my girlfriend) how she was feeling about her mom having surgery. The reason I haven’t was because I didn’t want to bring up the subject and end up making her cry; I told her this. I told her that I already know how she must be feeling to some extent and basically that I didn’t want to bring her spirits down. I believe that by asking how she’s feeling about her mom it would’ve essentially ruined her mood as we were doing good and acting fine since the surgery. I apologized and told her my reasoning for not asking and she said I was making excuses and that she’s in the right for believing I don’t care. I’m honestly hurt by these accusations as I truly do care about her, her mom, and how they must be feeling. The way she made that accusation out of nowhere that I don’t care and the fact that she couldn’t see my point of view at all and that I was just making excuses seems way too harsh.

I don't know why but I believe that they believed that shooter games make you violent, even though that's been disproven as much as mercola.com has.

They were very strict about the ESRB and PEGI ratings. Literally the only shooter game they ever let me play is Overwatch because of its toony art style. Gotta love Boomer parenting and logic.

Now I'm 17, the age of recommendation for these games and they're STILL are against me playing them.

They probably believe that because I have autism and that makes me more immature than most, that I'm not mature enough, that I don't know not to shoot up a school because the video game says so. Even when I live in the United States, notorious for school shootings, and have been told countless times about the damage it does.

Like my mom (we'll call her Karen) was taking a nap and I decided to ~~buy~~ (was $15 a while back because my dad let me, never really played it since then) and play CS:GO (All I wanted to do was surf), but then she woke up and started yelling at me ""What are you playing? Get off of there!""

And I immediately had to interrupt her and tell her that I bought this with my own money, that I am legally old enough to play these games, that I had to wait for an eternity to, and that I'm almost an adult and she should not police me on what games I play anymore.

She then shut up but seemed a little pissy as she was cleaning the kitchen, probably because I was bordering on yelling at her. Seriously it's ridiculous.

I accepted, because I was like ""Playing instruments? Sure, it works for me."" Near the end of school, I was accepted into marching band. Now, right off the bat, I didn't like the idea. Doing something like this is not something I want to do for the rest of the time I'm in school. But I still went to the after school practices and got a taste of what it's going to be like. I didn't like it, so one time after one of them I went to my mom and said ""Mom, I don't want to be in marching band. I don't like the environment, and the people that are involved in it."" She then shut me down and this argument went on for about two hours.

&nbsp;

Fast forward to last night. I casually said one thing about not wanting to be in marching band to my mom, and she said something along the line of ""What? I thought I convinced you."" My dad got involved and said along with my mom that it's going to teach me stuff like discipline and all the other stuff you would expect from a dad saying to a son to get him involved in stuff. My dad and my mom were really disappointed in my attitude, and my mom even did the fake crying thing at one point (I could tell it was fake crying because literally 3 seconds later she was fine.)

&nbsp;

My parents keep going on and on about how I'm going to turn into a lazy slob that will want to do nothing in life just because I don't want to be involved with this ONE THING.

That’s not the point, don’t disrespect my stuff. The point for me where I didn’t want him in my home anymore was when he brought a backpack FULL of drugs to my house. I thought he was just bringing me some carts, but he had a shit ton of stuff in there, pills, and what have you. I haven’t talked much since then, which was in January, but he still interacts with my fiancé at work. My fiancé doesn’t take his calls anymore, but I don’t think the dude has caught on we don’t want him in our home. I don’t think my fiancé would want to invite him either, but he might feel obliged since he’s inviting other coworkers.	Not the A-hole	0	0

My friend (22F) and I (22F) were at my friends pool because it’s summer and we’re in Houston and the pool is one of the only bearable places to be outside. Anyways. The pool was pretty crowded but there were plenty pool lounge chairs available. The problem was because of the angle of the building and the sun coming down, only about 1/3 of these chairs were still in the sunlight, which obviously isn’t ideal if you want to tan. 

Me and my friend dragged two pool lounge chairs over into the sun so we could tan, out our stuff down on them, etc. After awhile we got into the pool. The pool had lounge chairs in the water near a waterfall that you could rock back and forth in, so we were sitting on those, relaxing and talking. A lady (idk, 40+?) walks over to us and says, “Are you ladies using those chairs?” And I say “Yeah, sorry!”

She then clicks her teeth and says, “Really? You’re using the chairs even though you’re sitting over here in the pool?” And all I could muster up to say was, “Yes...” very unconfidently because I didn’t know if I was breaking some unsaid pool rules. She then stormed off and exited the pool.

At the time, she didn't have the income and credit to qualify for the lease, but I did and still allowed him on the lease (clearly I wasn't thinking).  He also assured me that he was a clean individual.

Now, over the course of living with him, I've come to realize that he isn't to my standards of living.  He has gotten better, but there are still some things that aren't up to my standard. I understand he is just as entitled to live how he wants as I am since we're both on it. We've had our disagreements which we have ironed out, but I have no interest in signing another lease with him.

I have already been in discussion with my landlord, and I intend to resign the lease when it's up, but as the sole lessee with permission for him to live there, so I can call the shots.

The way I see it, he shouldn't have been on the lease in the first place and got a pass which he is abusing.  I don't need a roommate, but I have no problem with them cutting my living expenses if it means they treat my environment the same as I do.  I feel as if I need to protect myself and I'm being more than compensating allowing him to live there after signing the new lease.

From January to the end of April, our family went on a trip to Hong Kong. My dad tried to force me to stay there and get a job there.

I'm trans mtf and he's been nothing but transphobic since he found out.

His reason for keeping me in Hong Kong that long was to prevent me from getting HRT. He outright said to a therapist he dragged me to that he would have let me go back sooner if I agreed to never take HRT. It took me threatening to raise money to go home myself and posting about it on facebook for him to agree to let me go home.

After getting back, he continues to be transphobic and is now a control freak. He demands to know everything I do and continues to refuse to let me take HRT. I can't even keep my door closed.

I've pretty much had enough of that and want to move out as soon as I manage to find a job. I'm already 6 months behind on my HRT because of this.

He keeps trying to guilt trip me by saying stuff like I'm selfish for wanting to take HRT and that I have to help out because his business is suffering due to the trade war.

Around a week ago I(24m) made the decision to shave off my beard. Not all of it though. I went from full beard to light stubble, haven't been clean shaven in years. My girlfriend(23f) has done NOTHING but complain since I did this, telling me how much it bothers her and how she's not nearly as attracted to me. I'm the first to admit I suffer from a bad case of baby face without it, which Is why I dont go fully clean. She tells me my face looks awkward without it and how I shouldn't do it again, she even commented how she's glad she's leaving the country for a few weeks and how that will give me time to grow it back for her coming home.

Anyway, yesterday I snapped when she brought it up for the 3rd time that day. I asked if she wanted to see a movie, she said 'great, I wont need to see your baby face that way!'. I snapped and told her that she'd been slowly putting on weight lately and I wasnt as attracted to her either, but I love her so I dont go on and on about it constantly.  Naturally she started crying, stormed out of my house and hasn't spoken to me since. 

Now while I do think I was an asshole for losing my temper, what I'm asking is was I the asshole for going after her insecurity and essentially calling her fat after she was complaining to me for days?

Sidenote: I had talked to her about this first. I told her that it sucked listening to her talk about how she wasnt as attracted to me, and she simply told me she was just being honest and I cant tell her not to express her opinions.

EDIT: spelling

c2lzp7	2019-06-19 20:09:25		AITA for using my cane at my mother's anniversary party?	"So to be clear: I can use glasses to see but I cannot wear them for a long time (Max time is about 40 to 50 min) without starting to get migraines. This is due to a absurd amount of surgery and the strength my glasses are. 

(Background stuff below)

Normally for staying around my house or small errands to get food, I'll use my cane to get around as I don't see those tasks as being worth the migraines.

However, my family says that I can't use it when I'm around them or if I go out with them to places. The reason being that it causes too much attention and Im old enough (18)  to handle the pain by now. 

My family also low-key follows the Quiverfull movement so that plays a LARGE role in this. Tldr: Parents are always right no matter how old you are. 
 
**Keep in mind that being disabled where I live is heavily looked down upon and effects your rights as an adult which is why I'm pressured to appear as normal as possible.**

(Actual AITA part) 

My mum decided to throw a party for her anniversary to my dad! I was totally excited and pumped for her, helping her plan it out etc. However, the problem for me was that she wanted to go to a lake area and hike around in the foothills. It's going to be rough 5 hours long. I am still helping her plan this to be clear!

 I asked her if she would be fine with me using my cane for the hiking or if I could stay on the lake area so I would not get a migraine from wearing my glasses that long. I made sure to tell her that I would totally be still helping her plan for it as well as arrange the catering + send invites online.  The problem is that she said by me using my cane that I would be drawing all the attention to myself and that's selfish to do when it's her party. 

I didn't think it would be that distracting to her guests but offered to make a cover for the cane so it wouldn't be it's normal red and white but a plain grey or brown tone. That was also refused as ""that will cause even more attention!"". 

I'm not too sure what to do here as I don't want to take attention away from her special day but I also don't want to start snapping people or have to sit in the car when I get a bad migraine from wearing my glasses. 

**My dad has said its between me and my mother only!**

c2lz6f	2019-06-19 20:08:19		WIBTA If I said something to a neighbor about common courtesy in the parking lot	"I live in a small apartment building that shares a rather small parking lot (think 7 spaces on each side) with another building. Common courtesy here, as I'd figure anywhere else, is that you pull out of the driveway of the lot on one side, and into on the other side. Common sense I thought.

I was coming home from a quick trip to the local convenience store, and when I went to pull in, there was a car from the other side of the lot attempting to pull out of the lot, but they were directly in the middle of the driveway. They weren't even pulled all the way up, they were just sitting right behind the side walk where I'd never be able to see them due to the below mentioned on street parking.

I didn't have room enough to maneuver onto the correct side to pull in, as our neighborhood has quite a bit of on street parking. I quickly had to readjust and carefully pull in on the wrong side, and was in serious danger of hitting my landlord, my neighbor, and my boyfriend's vehicles. I'm a careful driver, so I didn't. 

The biggest problem is that, due to their position, I could have hit them head on if I didn't readjust quickly enough. 

I am very well aware that it could have been simply a one off incident where we were both in the wrong place at the wrong time. My question is, would I be the asshole if I brought this up to them again, just to avoid it in the future? I don't know them very well and have never even spoken to them. The issue is seriously just that, with so much on street parking at literally every corner, it's imperative that we're all safe and following common courtesy rules.

So I'm a gay guy, and occasionally I go to bathhouses to get a good massage, and some steam room action. After what seemed like a couple of hours, I decided to go home. While I was in the locker room, one of the guys I hooked up with asked me if I wanted to grab some coffee, and I obliged.

We were having a good time talking over coffee, and as we were about to end, I invited him to go into a motel for a quickie. At first he was hesitant to go because its already really late, and he has work the following day. But I was horny so I insisted, and he eventually agreed.

At the motel, everything was okay at the beginning. The foreplay was amazing, and I'm not gonna go into the details, but we seemed to be having fun.

After about 30 minutes, I decided to finish myself. This is where the trouble begins. Because I came first, I kinda lost interest, and my FUBU caught on to this. I told him that I'm still interested, and I tried to continue pleasuring him, but he started acting all upset. He kept asking me if I only asked him here because I wanted a one night stand, which I denied. I did like him, well at first, but now he's acting all clingy and needy. At that point I didn't even know what to say anymore, so there was just silence. Until he decided to leave. 

I know that it's also my responsibility to make my FUBU finish and I did try, but obviously it wasn't enough for him. So am I the asshole here or was he just being dramatic?

TL;DR: Had a hookup. I came first. I lost interest in my FUBU after that. Now he's upset."	Asshole	0	0
c2lyq5	2019-06-19 20:07:16	GanikusRM	AITA For Thinking Employees Shouldn't Be Catered To At The Expense Of Others	"Let me preface this by saying I am 100% for people taking vacations/days off when they feel they need to. What I am not for is someone planning a vacation in spite of knowing their schedule and then demanding the schedule be changed to accommodate their time off. Especially when accommodating them inconveniences several (approx. 500) others.

&#x200B;

In my office (general manager's office over 6 other offices) we produce a monthly schedule for the 6 other dental offices. We have had July's schedule posted for at least the past 10 days. Today (06/19/19) two different sales position employees approached me and told me they would be on vacation and that I needed to change the schedule so they wouldn't miss their biggest production days (they get paid on commission). I told them to enjoy their vacations, but that I would not change the schedule, which had been posted for nearly 2 weeks,  just to accommodate them. Both employees were very upset by this and decided to complain to the owner and beg him to make me change the schedule. The owner reached out to me and asked if I would be willing to adjust the schedule so these 2 employees ""could benefit the most from their vacations."" I told him, as kindly as possible, that changing the schedule to accommodate these 2 employees would require disrupting 4 offices and nearly 500 patients. After hearing this the owner seemed to think for a moment and then told me I needed to do it anyway because these 2 employees are ""really good and deserve it.""

&#x200B;

So now I am adjusting the schedule so these 2 jerks can have their stupid vacations and having everyone else get pissed at me for making last minute changes. Am I the asshole for trying to refuse to change the entire schedule for these 2 employees?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am not upset that the employees are taking time off, that I couldn't care less about. What I care about is them forcing the schedule to be changed to accommodate their vacations at the inconvenience of the other offices and all of our patients.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: The schedule that is made is for the attending doctor, not the employees. The employees are asking to change the doctor's schedule so they won't miss out on their highest producing (money making) days."	Asshole	0	0
c2lwg0	2019-06-19 20:02:33	amu9870	AITA for expecting my friends to reciprocate the EXACT amount of energy I put into them?	"I'm naturally a very defending, caring person. When I enter friendships I do the absolute most for that person and their self-esteem because I believe they deserve to be happy. I literally do the MOST with emotional support, I don't spend money on them without them telling me to but I will not belittle them, I will listen to every single thing they say without judgment because that's exactly how I want to be treated. If they have a problem, I'll drop my shit to help them. There have been times where I have to ignore someone that I'm interested in to take care of my friend. I often find that in these relationships, I'm the only one doing the absolute most.

These people don't ask me to do the most but I do it anyways and when they don't reciprocate even in the slightest way, it breaks my trust in them, it actually breaks the whole relationship.  I've cut off so many people over the years and I'm wondering if I keep running into assholes or if I just hold people to too high of standards. I wish I could chill on the amount of care that I put into people but I'm completely unable to and it's the stupidest thing in the world. I'm not even a loving person I just feel like I HAVE TO care for people close to me. I don't know if anyone else experiences this but that's just how I am.

&#x200B;

Is it me, or them?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Ok I also want to clarify, my friends will expect me to drop shit for them occasionally but will never drop their shit for me when I ask. Like I feel like I'm just being used as a doormat and like they don't care about me whatsoever. I was always taught by my family members to listen when someone opens up about themselves and I thought everyone was taught that same sentiment. I literally just want my friends to be there. like just to be there for me at least once just so I know that I'm not that trashcan that they can only contact to dump all their shit onto. Like I had a friend that told me all of her problems that told me to meet up with her in the park and shit to come and talk about her problems, and when I told her about something that was really upsetting me, she responded with ""Honestly, I'm sorry but I don't care"" I've had a lot of friends like this.

EDIT #2 I never said I was a nice person, I never meant to insinuate it either. I don't think I'm God's fucking gift to these people, it's just that I want to treat people EXACTLY the way I'd wish to be treated, but not everyone can do that in return. Not everyone adheres to the golden rule. And it's not even a nice thing to be available for people. It's a human thing to do, which is why it hurts when my feelings or problems are literally ignored by my friends. It makes me feel like they don't care about me at all. I thought that quite a few people had to deal with this before I read the comments on this post, but I'm glad I posted it and found out that I'm the only one. Idk how to bold but 

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MATERIAL POSSESSIONS OR PHYSICAL GIFTS SO PLEASE DON'T BRING THAT UP, IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO MY ISSUE AT ALL. ENERGY IS MUCH HARDER TO GIVE THAN AN ITEM. 

Also, thank you to most of the commenters so far, y'all dished out some truth that I wasn't ready to hear yet but I appreciate it. I'm really trying to work on a balance, not giving out too much of myself to people and not being emotionally vacant to those who actually do need me."	Asshole	0	0

Background: My parents' marriage has been... less than ideal. When they met, they were both heavy drinkers addicted to nicotine. They started dating and eventually decided to have unprotected sex and get married if they had a kid. They did end up getting married, and four months later I was born and they both got their lives together and raised me. 

I'm in my twenties now and I have no contact with my mom. She has untreated mental health issues that she refuses to deal with and instead has used them as an excuse to emotionally abuse my dad and I for decades. My dad still lives with her, but he says they feel more like roommates than a married couple and he has mentioned to me multiple times that he has considered suggesting an ammicable divorce.

Here's the thing, he never goes through with it because he feels bad for my mom and he believes she truly did love him at some point. He doesn't know that my mom had talked trash about him for most of my life. And I don't think it's fair to not let him have all the information while deciding if he wants to divorce my mom or not. But at the same time, I don't know if it's my place to tell him or if that would be forcing myself into my parents' marriage. 

So, reddit, would I be the asshole if I told my dad that over the years my mom had told me...

- She was planning on being a single mother. She was genuinely shocked when my dad bettered himself and stuck around to help raise me. 

- She constantly complained about how my dad never did anything to help around the house. (He did help when he could. She yelled at him saying he was doing it wrong most of the times he tried.) 

- She told me he was inconsiderate and would always chose his friends over her. (He made plans with his friends weeks in advance and didn't drop them just because my mom was in the mood to hang out.)

- My mom compared my dad's behavior to that of her physically, emotionally, and psychogically abusive mother after he refused to ""admit"" to doing something she claimed to remember him doing. He didn't do what she said he did. 

- She would complain about how he was always spending money on ""fun toys"" he wanted but never got her a new motorhome (His ""new toys"" were one or two ~$100 weapons a year and trading in his old vehicle for a new one a couple of times. She wants a motorhome that is at least $100,000 and she shoots down any offers he makes to get her things they can actually afford.)"	Asshole	0	0
c2lsgx	2019-06-19 19:54:05		AITA for telling my best friend that I needed space.	"Last year, my best friend took this girl home and she never left. Like literally moved in from day one. To complicate matters, she had cheated on her current boyfriend with my best friend. I had my reservations, which I expressed to my buddy but he ignored me. Months later, she broke up with him. He was heartbroken but they got back together a week later. 

Then it happened again. And then once again. And another time. I’m not sure about all the personal dynamics between the two of them but every time they “broke up” my friend would come to me for consolation and I always obliged. Eventually, it got to a point where I had to have an intervention. I expressed in the kindest way I could that this girl was bad news and that he is only hurting himself by getting back together with her. Eventually, they got into an argument and my buddy punched a wall in anger, breaking his hand. 

He swore her off for the “last time” and again,
I gave him consolation, expressing my annoyance that he keeps getting himself into this situation. Yet again, they started hanging out and “broke up” yet again. This time, she broke into his house and stole the pain medication he had been prescribed for his broken hand. 

My buddy said that was the last straw but of course, they were hanging out a week later. This time, I expressed to him that this girl is a real danger and could seriously do some damage to his life, which he promptly ignored. As it turns out, she went to the doctor and had her birth control (IUD?) removed without telling my friend and she promptly got pregnant, holding the pregnancy over his head. He had to get the police involved due to the harassment and decided to stop talking to her. Furthermore, she contacted the mother of my friends kid and talk shit and tells her about all their drama. 

Finally, the dust settles and he hasn’t talked to her. The relationship he had with this girl really took its toll on our friendship, but we recovered. However, the other day I was on a jog and saw them driving in his car. They are hanging out again. I told him that I needed space from him and that I certainly didn’t want to be around her. He’s upset and says that I don’t give him love “unconditionally” like he requires from all his friends. But I just can’t be around that kind of toxicity. What do I do here? Am I the asshole?"		1	0

OP received criticism for not helping the cat and now I'm thinking about my situation and feeling guilty again and wondering what I should do. 

My boyfriend and I recently moved out from a house we shared with one roommate (used to be a couple but they broke up). Roomie herself was chill, but was often busy and not home much. So Roomie had this cat that was rarely pet, stayed outside a lot, and there was a litter box but it was almost always full and very smelly. Roomie never seemed to care, but she would change it if asked politely. The cat was desperate for attention, but she often had open wounds and scabs all over her so nobody ever wanted to cuddle with her. I felt bad when I would push her away, but I also have a dog and he gets possessive around other animals.

Around March, the cat started doing this weird thing where she would sit in one corner of the kitchen all day and night, literally for hours at a time. She would just sit motionless, sometime staring at the wall but usually facing us but staring at the ground. I thought she might be in a lot of pain, and when I mentioned it, Roomie just said that she was taking her to the vet soon. The cat also frequently peed on my stuff, Roomie's stuff, and just the floor, which I thought might be a UTI or something, but I kind of let it go and hoped this vet appointment would come soon.

I moved out at the beginning of June, and it took everything in me not to pack up the cat with my things and take her to a rescue somewhere. I just knew if I did it around my move-out time, it would probably look suspicious. Roomie always said how much she loved and cared for the cat so I was also scared of really upsetting her if the cat were to disappear. But now that I'm gone, I keep thinking of the cat. Who is putting food down for her when Roomie leaves town for days? Has her litter box been changed at all since I left? I expressed this to my boyfriend and he kind of jokingly said that we could catnap her and take her to a rescue. I thought that was way too wild, but now I'm thinking that it might be ""the right thing to do"" for the cat. I'm a little scared that Roomie would go ballistic and start searching all over town, but honestly if I pick the cat up from outside the house and turn her in as a stray somewhere, I don't think it would get back to me...

TLDR: Would I be the asshole if I kidnapped my old roommate's neglected outside cat and took her to \[hopefully\] a better life?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2lpxp	2019-06-19 19:48:18	CALJUMAI	AITA For wanting my SO to try and talk to a Therapist?	"  

I kind of don’t know where to begin, some background is needed and I will try and keep it all in order.

I met my SO online, and about 3 years ago we moved in together after dating for 4 months. The first year was a whirlwind of emotions. We both were dealing with depression and took our frustrations out on each other. During that time, he helped encourage me to try and talk about my feelings instead of keeping them holed up, and I am more open. I appreciate that I am able to actually talk about things constructively and not ruin my entire day over something making me mad. But after all this time, he will not do the same for me. While I am expected to talk about what is wrong right then and there, if I don’t give him space then I am a jerk who doesn’t know boundaries. 

Anyways, we fight a lot less now. We are both on medication which personally has helped us both out a lot. One thing we were never able to do, when he was going thru his worst bouts, was get him to talk to a therapist. There were never any openings, didn’t take his insurance, all that. He was in a couple group counseling programs to try and talk about his problems. The first one he was transferred out of cause his problems were to severe for them to deal with. The second he was kicked out of because they switched his meds, which made him sick. He missed a couple days and when he got back they said he was no longer welcome for missing so much.

That is all in the past now, and he is in a healthier place. 

Monday, I chatted with a coworker who sees someone, and she gave me the information to the place she goes to. 

Today, work started off really rough for my SO. People yelled at him for doing his job, bosses got mad and defended the people who mad money, total BS. I suggested to him the place my coworker goes to, since we were never able to explore that option and it was something he wanted to do in the past. He got pissy with me and told me he is not going and to not suggest it again. 

I am tired of him getting mad at me when an outside force makes him mad. He can't get a grip on his anger, and I get sick of not being able to talk to him in case I make him mad. Like I said, for the most part we do not fight, but we also don’t fight a lot because I know he has anger problems and its not worth getting into an argument.

We get married in October. WIBTA if I tell him if he doesn’t try and at least talk to someone, whether it works out or not, we might need to put our wedding plans on hold?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2lprl	2019-06-19 19:47:53		WIBTA if I told my friend his new gf killed her ex’s dog?	"Hey all, a good friend of mine recently met someone new, divorced his wife, and is apparently crazy about this new girl.

After a friend did some digging, it turns out his new gf was a porn star for quite awhile.  That’s not really a big deal imo.  Maybe she told him, maybe she didn’t.  Idc.  But there was a separate article about how she killed her ex’s dog, and abandoned their cat when they split.  The article even offers screenshots from her as proof.  It looks legit.

We’re concerned for him.  After talking about it in our friend group, we’re pretty torn on whether or not to tell him.  We doubt she would’ve told him something like that, and we all talked about how we would want to know if we were dating a dog killing porn star.  Again, the porn is something that isn’t a huge deal if it’s talked about, but the animal abuse is really where it went over the line for us.  However, he seems genuinely happy for the first time in awhile.

Would we be the assholes if we told him about it anonymously?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2lozz	2019-06-19 19:46:16	Bossubaru	AITA for being slightly happy that my girlfriends pregnancy is ending early.	First time posting anywhere. So context behind this is my girlfriend of 6 months cheated on me with her ex and I found out and we broke up. Fast forward 2 months I forgive her and we’re back together. One month of being together she tells me she is pregnant and that it’s probably his kid. Whatever I think I’m a good person so I cry for a day and then trot along with life because I love her and I accept it. She has an IUD which is supposed to stop pregnancy. Well she went to the doctor and took another test that came back negative and in all likelihood the child is probably dead because of the IUD. I’ve had a lot of emotions over the week of all the news and finally I hear news that makes me happy. I’m aware that this is a bad situation for her and I’m feeling bad for her. A week later I can’t take it anymore I break down crying because of how much of a shitty person I felt like I was. I told her I was happy that she wasn’t having a kid with her ex and I knew she was going to hate me for it but it needed to be said. So AITA for being happy over this. I feel like I am.  She might break up with me because of my feeling this way. Idk how I’m supposed to feel but idk if I’m an asshole or not.	Asshole	0	0

c2lna7	2019-06-19 19:42:31	-1155	WIBTA if I didn't go to Anime Expo with my friends even though I am responsible for driving?	"**Context**  
My relationship with anime is love-hate. I loved anime in middle school and binged on series after series. I attended my local anime convention with friends every year since then and cosplayed. I was the vice-president of anime club. My walls were covered with anime posters. I was a weeb.

Now that I'm in college, though, I have way too much on my plate to watch even an episode on the weekend. I have no idea what's new in anime. Frankly, I'm uninterested. I now spend more time watching movies and reading books. Cosplays look cool on other people but it's now embarrassing for me to wear one. The memes are outdated. I'm also beginning to adapt a frugal lifestyle. The last anime convention I went to, I purchased no merch. And I think the outcome would be the same at AX (Anime Expo).

You get the idea; I just don't care about anime.

&#x200B;

**Info**  
My friends and I bought our AX tickets last December for $90. I volunteered to drive 6 hours to LA, not because I really wanted to, but because they couldn't drive/didn't have their licenses at that point. Now, all of us do, but 2 out of 4 of us have strict parents (spoiler alert, we are youngin teenagers) who wouldn't let them drive out of safety. I also did the hotel reservation, which came out to $140 a person. I am best friends with one of them, but I don't know the other 2 people just as well.

&#x200B;

**The Issue**  
I don't want to go to AX. The ticket price seemed like it was worth it when I bought it, because I had friends hyping me to go. Now, I don't want to had spent $90 on a ticket to buy anime merch and attend snooze fest panels. I'm sure they'd have fun without me anyways, but what I'm concerned about is their transportation. I want to ask the other girl (who doesn't have strict parents) if she can drive instead. If not, I have another friend who is driving to AX solo. I'm wondering if they can take the 3 girls with them. I'm also thinking of selling my four-day AX ticket for the same price I bought ($90) since it is now $126 on the site. My friends would also need to pay an extra $50 or so for the hotel, since I wouldn't be there.

The thing is, I talked about this with one of my friends going on the trip. I told her that I want to bail the trip because I'm no longer interested in anime. Instead of giving me her clear thoughts, she replied ""it'll be fun!"" Normally, she'd tell me that it's up to me, but I think she replied that because she really needs me to drive.

**The Big question**  
Will I be the asshole if I backed out of this trip since I'm responsible for driving? Will this situation resolve if I find someone to drive them? Honestly, I don't care if I'm an asshole or not. I just want them to have a fun and safe trip to AX. What should I do instead?

Update: A different friend, who was not originally in the group, wants to go. She can either cover the hotel cost so that everyone is paying $140 each again. She is offering them to stay at her apartment. This relieves the hotel situation, however, she is still *not sure.*

Update #2: I asked one of them if they can drive and they can!

**Big update**  
I found a driver to take them and a friend to replace me for the hotel (money)! Thank you guys for helping me with this. Let's hope that their trip goes well!"	Asshole	0	0
c2lmy7	2019-06-19 19:41:47		WIBTA if I tell my roommate that she can't let her boyfriend stay overnight?	"First of all: my roommate directly shares the same room as me, and on top of that, we sleep on a bunk bed (she has the bottom bunk). Also, this post is going to be specifically about **overnight** stays, not visits during the day.

To give a little more background, this roommate is actually a new one, so I don't know her well and haven't even met her in person yet as I went vacationing for the beginning of summer (we're all university students living off campus). My usual roommate subletted her metaphorical half of the room as she wasn't going to be staying at all for the summer, and so that's why I now have to deal with a new one who is apparently used to letting her boyfriend stay overnight a few times a week.

Now, the reason why I don't want her boyfriend to stay over is because I'm a very private introvert who has a good amount of social anxiety (I can't afford a single room though, hence the roommates). If I were living in a separate room, sure, she could let him stay a few times a week and do whatever. However, I don't want to wake up to an extra person in the room, or be self-aware when I go out for a drink of water in the middle of the night, or make *small talk* if we happen to be alone in the room together. If you're wondering how my usual roommate and I dealt with it, for the record I did let her boyfriend stay overnight about once or twice a week. However, I'm very close to my usual roommate, I was already acquaintances with her boyfriend (I was actually the one who introduced them lol), and her boyfriend is a pretty introverted guy himself. I mean, I was still uncomfortable about the situation, but I get that couples need their time together; also, my usual roommate was unable to stay overnight at her boyfriend's place, so I accommodated them.

I've been doubting myself about putting my foot down though because it does seem a bit assholish to me to absolutely not let a couple sleep together. I myself never have overnight guests and identify as aromantic and asexual, so I'm worried that I'm projecting my lack of a need to sleep with anyone (sexually and nonsexually) onto others. Should I just put up with it and tell her that I'd be good with letting her boyfriend stay over once a week? I haven't asked yet whether or not my new roommate can stay at her boyfriend's place, but if she can't, should I just use the same system I used with my usual roommate despite my discomfort? Obviously, if I did tell her I was okay with it I'd put down the usual SO etiquette rules (like no horizontal tango while I'm in the room).

So, good people of Reddit, now that I'm coming back to school and beginning to discuss overnight stays for guests WIBTA if I put my foot down about the matter?

c2lks2	2019-06-19 19:37:00	r2401	"AITA I ""hacked"" facebook pages of employees"	"Years ago I supervised a staff of about 20 college aged workers.  Part of the job included a service desk with a shared computer, and since there was a ton of downtime, the workers would often go on facebook, youtube whatever.  

&#x200B;

I didn't really have a problem with it because downtime is just downtime to me, but technically it was against the rules and technically I was supposed to write them up.  I was very friendly with most of the employees since we were similar in age and it was a casual work atmosphere.  So I told them I would not write them up but they needed to log out when leaving the computer because that's when the big bosses would be likely to see the rule being broken if facebook was just left on a screen.    


I told them all that whenever I caught them doing that I'd write a funny status update or mess with their account in some way.  This happened dozens of times and people all just laughed at the offenders when it happened.   Examples of things I did: I set a bunch of relationship statuses to single, I made a filipino girl post that mayweather>pacquiao (that one got a real good response), etc.  


One girl who was relatively new left her facebook on and I wrote something about needing advice on pregnancy and dropping out of school and on what kind of options would be available to her.  Oh she was really angry about this.  She said her family saw and were upset and how they were catholic so it was especially bad.   So this became a thing.

&#x200B;

I asked if they accepted the explanation that it was an office prank, and she said it didn't matter.  I accepted that at face value but I just now realized maybe she didn't tell them that she had any culpability (i.e. she broke any rule to precipitate this, maybe she just said I messed with her fb).  In either case I apologized even though deep down I didn't feel like I was totally in the wrong since I made it explicitly clear what the consequence of going on facebook on the work computer would be, and in my mind I was cutting them a break by not writing them up.

&#x200B;

In hindsight I should have recognized that she was somewhat new, and not really buddy buddy with the group like everyone else so I should have been more careful.  We just had so much fun with it every previous instance that I was caught off guard.  Even the people victimized by the ""hacking"" always thought it a lark."	Asshole	0	0
c2lkec	2019-06-19 19:36:07	TheSupremeLordOfPi	WIBTA if I told a friend that I found out he was bi?	"At school, we were taking gay tests (linked [here](https://www.allthetests.com/quiz34/quiz/1502042431/Gay-Test), though it's a really bad test) because a gay person (Doug) in our class asked us to do so. One of the questions asks you to say what you think you identify as sexually, and a classmate (Bernard) immediately put bisexual. It turns out that Doug was looking over his screen when he put that. It was not an accident as he did not go back and correct it, and Doug was not really being an asshole because everyone was looking over our screens while we were doing the tests.

&#x200B;

Later, he texts me saying that Bernard put that he is bi. Since that, for the past week I have not told anyone except discussed it with Doug. Bernard doesn't know that Doug knows.

&#x200B;

I feel like it wouldn't be a very good idea to tell Bernard I know (though I could lie and say I saw over to not put Doug in trouble with him. However, I also think that he should know that I know. According to somebody else (Bernard already told this person, and he made it very obvious that he knew), Bernard isn't 100% sure yet.

&#x200B;

Obviously I'm not going to tell anyone else until he comes out (or even if he ever comes out), but if I asked him if I could talk in private with him, WIBTA if I told him?

c2lk4x	2019-06-19 19:35:30	Effectuality	AITA for asking my partner to pay her share?	"So my fiance and I have been together for about 8 years, have two kids and have literally just bought a house - like haven't even moved in yet. We're going to the bank today to work out the structure of the mortgage, and still need to organise insurance and budgets and all that.

Here's the thing: neither of us is particularly good at budgeting. We're on a fairly standard pay packet as a family, though I earn about half again what she does. While I've been working and saving for a house for more than the time we've been together, she's worked on and off because of the children and the cost of childcare, and so never put any savings together. We just bought the house with literally my life savings as a deposit. I'm okay with that because we've always had joint accounts and my money's always been our money, but now my fiance has started working again (since Feb), she's been telling me all these things she wants to do or own, including not one but two horses, three chickens plus a chicken run and organic vegetable garden, a new kitchen, courses that won't have a financial benefit but will cost money to do and leave her with like no time for sleep, yadda yadda yadda. 

My problem is that not only are we buying this house and about to start paying off a mortgage, we're also getting married in April next year and then the year after that we're going to a buddy's wedding on the other side of the planet, which we already know is gonna be mega costly. So expendable income ain't exactly a thing right now. But my wife to be keeps telling me all these things she wants, like the moment we get into our new house, and I keep having  to tell her to be reasonable about time frames.

Last night I lost the plot over it because she was telling me about the latest course she wants to take up half the back yard to do, and all I'm hearing is the sound of money disappearing for no gain other than her own satisfaction. I basically told her to pull her head in and stop spending all our money, because while she thinks her pay check is covering it all, I cover the bulk of the costs with my pay check and I get to do nothing I want because I'm conscious of the cost. I told her I think we should be paying 50/50 for the house and the utilities, which she thinks is unfair because I earn more. She went off to work last night and has been giving me the cold shoulder since.

c2ljio	2019-06-19 19:34:08		AITA (or an A at least) for jumping ship from this failing sculpture department?	"A few years back I was a student in this college sculpture/foundry department. I played a pretty big role in the class like by helping with the sculpture club, prepping molds for other students, being a regular on the pour crew, and watching other first semester students to make sure no one killed themself. I was pretty much an unpayed class aid and the class was run like it was held together with duct tape. While I loved the opportunity I had with those materials and tools, I was sorta dying from the awful people there. 

The teacher, Mr. J, was a misogynist in denial who loved hearing his own voice at the expense of class time. for example he once boasted to me that he can smell when a woman is on her period, and he *loved* talking about his colon health. A lot of the core class supplies like wax and bronze for the students had to be ordered and picked up by the sculpture club, meaning a student had to drive two hours north out of their own pocket will a pick up truck to get the literal tons of bronze for all of the classes. Mr. J meanwhile did hardly anything accept complain.

Right before I left, the actual class technician, who I thought was a close friend, turned out to be a creap who was grooming a younger student (he was 45, she was 18), and an older woman in the class was an actual sociopath who manipulated everyone she ever met including myself. It was a dumpster fire and I was tired of the heat, so as soon as I could finish my degree there I jumped ship. I was pretty immature at the time too, and had a lot of anxiety around them which is a big reason why I did it.

Well, today I ran into a classmate who told me the sculpture class was falling apart. After the technician was fired (for sexual harassment of course) the teacher couldn't keep the facillity together. Kilns broke down, student work remained unfinished and even unpoured despite the students paying for their bronze. He hired a second teacher who never actually watched the students and allowed them to use power tools and dangerous chemicals without any training or supervision. Most notably Mr. J is now apperantly under investigation for selling class metarial to students for his own profit. (a BIG no-no. any profits must go into the class.) 

Thing is I keep feeling guilty for leaving. Like maybe if I had stayed things wouldn't be so bad. I feel like maybe my choice let people down, and in some way ruined the class for future students.

c2ljcy	2019-06-19 19:33:47	Vic_Freeze	AITA because I won't friend my mom on Facebook?	"I'm a 22 year old guy (adult). However, I have a very... opinionated mother. She's a wonderful person. However, she and I have differing viewpoints on a lot of subjects, such as religion, politics, etc., and she has a very critical personality. As such, I am often subjected to questioning from her about every little thing I do, and I then explain myself to her. I do not enjoy this; she's still my mom, but the constant questioning and judging kinda sucks.

Now, as far as my Facebook use goes, I'm not a huge social media fan; I only have about 50 or so friends on there. I use it mainly to schedule events with said friends, and to follow a few groups/organizations I'm interested in. However, I have not ""befriended"" my mom on Facebook, because I know that she will berate me for the memes I post, the people I know, the groups I follow, etc. I would rather not have her involved with it at all, TBH.

Now, the thing that pushes me to ask the question is: the other day, she ran into a woman at Walmart, whom I worked with for several years. Said woman mentioned that she is friends with me on Facebook (she and her husband also know my dad, who was there too). After they all left, I got several VERY angry texts from my mom: she called me names, she called my friend names, and she has been angry with me for days now. She has been alternating between refusing to talk to me, and yelling at me because her OWN SON (me) won't be friends with her on Facebook. 

So, am I the asshole here? I love my mom. I'm also probably going to stand my ground on this. But AITA?

I myself cant grow a beard and shave atleast once a week.

Now here's the acutal question/story:
My Friend recently got a girlfriend which he is madly in love with (also his first real girlfriend). After about 3 Weeks of dating she went to south america to live there for 4 Months. Before she went he made a promise to her to not shave these 4 months she is gone and would wait for her to come back before he shaves. 

It has been 6 weeks since and his beard is getting longer and longer. 
Now here is where i come in. 

Over these 6 weeks he made jokes about his beard how he looks like a hobo and that he should probably shave. 
I at first was like ""yeah you should"" in a jokingish manner. But over time it got more serious where i and some friends told him: ""yeah it doesnt really suit you, you should probably do that"".

He himself said that he doesnt care about how he looks he only cares about keeping the promise he gave to his girlfriend.
To which i harshly replied: ""we do"". 

Now i know that that reply was assholy from me but i only want him to know i dont really like his decision. I know i cant stop him from not shaving but AITA for telling him i want him to? 

Thanks for reading!  

PS: Throwaway acc. bc my main account has been locked for suspicous activity (cant currently retain it)

Edit: I fully know it is his decision i would never have brought it up if he didnt always say things like: I look like a hobo, I should probably shave and so on. I dont want him to feel pressured by me to shave his beard.

c2lh5x	2019-06-19 19:29:04	notsureifright123	AITA for supporting and visiting my stepson while he is in prison against his father (my ex-husband) and mother's wishes?	"My 19 year old stepson pleaded guilty to a violent crime and will be going to prison for a very long time, perhaps the rest of his life. I don't want to go into the details of his crime, but he admitted to doing it and is ready to receive his punishment. There were some mitigating factors, but that does not really matter. He did the crime and he pleaded guilty and he won't be leaving prison anytime soon.

When his father and I married, I was much younger than he was and I was naive about the situation. Stepson was 14 and his mom and dad fought over the joint custody of him. His dad is the type of man who thinks that being a parent is more about owning a child than actually loving them, so he would ignore his son as much as possible and would only pay attention when stepson was in trouble. His mom is a functioning alcoholic. Both his parents have high paid jobs that they focused on more than their son.

Stepson was basically allowed to do whatever he wanted and was often in trouble. Drugs, fighting, stealing, he was arrested more than once as a teen. I was pretty much the only one he would listen to and it caused some problems in my relationship with his father. His father and I divorced partly because I could not handle the drama and stress in that relationship. Before I left, I told stepson that if he ever needed me, I would be there for him.

Fast forward a few years and I got a phone call from stepson in jail, saying that he did something bad and needed help. He had tried calling his mom and dad, but they both hung up the phone on him. When I tried calling his dad, he never answered the phone and ignored my calls. I didn't want to abandon stepson, so I helped him get a lawyer and stood by his side during the legal process. Stepson knows he messed up and all he can do now is try to become a better person. 

His father found out that I had helped him and ever since, he has been calling (I don't answer) and texting me about it. He thinks that his son needs to face the consequences of his actions alone and that by helping him, I am enabling him and that he should be left to rot alone in prison. His mom left me a vicious voicemail and read me the Riot Act about being involved and that it wasn't my place to do anything in stepson's life. 

I asked my boyfriend about it and he thinks I am involving myself in a situation where I don't belong and that stepson deserves to be cut off from everyone. That if his hypothetical stepson had committed that crime, he would be so disgusted that he doesn't know how I can look past it to visit him in prison. And I know that what stepson did was awful, but I don't think anything is black and white in this world. He committed a crime, but it does the world no good to throw him away and not give him any chance of redemption.

Here is a list of things that have been bothering me (yes I have talked to him about all of these):

\-He seems to think his child should have different rules than the other kids (he gets a completely different dinner, just for one example) 

\-He doesn't care that his child constantly disrespects me, and my kids (he will yell and scream at them), and does the exact opposite of everything I ask (I am a primary caregiver to this child so there are times I really do need him to listen... ie parking lots, school day mornings, etc)

\-The boy's teacher sends home notes constantly with complaints similar to mine... he doesn't believe either of us and has no respect or care for the teacher

\-Says the boy ""has had a rough life"" so he is ""acting out"" but refuses to get therapy for him because ""therapy is a load of BS"" 

I am at my wits end here. I don't know how much more I can take. I am sick of the yelling, sick of the eye rolling and loud sighs, and the eggshells I constantly walk around on.

Anyway, today I was at a sandwich shop buying lunch. I am a white man. Behind me is a black lady. I was waiting for my order when she placed her order. She order a sandwich and asked for extra mayonnaise. In my head, I ran through the scene from the older movie ""Undercover Brother"" where they were training the main character to go under cover at a white country club and were getting him to eat a sandwich with  mayo - the whole discussion being that black people don't eat mayo.

If I had commented on her mayo choice (as a black woman) would that be asshole territory? 

Note, I did not make any comment - mostly because I didn't know her and didn't know if she had heard of the movie and even if she did I'm not sure the reference was big enough for her to get it (and explaining jokes make them not funny) -- but do want to know if it would be an asshole move or just inappropriate/unfunny."

c2lfcs	2019-06-19 19:25:07	teddy1997	AITA for telling my boss something I shouldn't have?	"Hi guys, I need some advice if I fucked up or not at work just now. For privacy reasons, I'm trying to keep this as vague as possible to bare with me. I work in the accounting department at an appliance distributor if that helps.

&#x200B;

I was put in charge of a project to make the accounting more efficient in our service department. My boss (Operations Manager) is still involved in the project obviously and suggested in our meeting yesterday that we take longer to pay out our warranty claims until after we get paid first from the manufacturer. I agreed to this idea since that makes the most logical sense and the way we've been doing it obviously isn't working. Everyone at the meeting agreed. 

&#x200B;

Today, one of my coworkers said that one of the ladies in the service department (Let's call her Lea) actually doesn't like this idea at all because ""our customers won't like that"". She's planning on going to the owner of the company (my boss's boss) to talk about it instead of just going to my boss and telling her she doesn't like the idea. I told my coworker that's probably not a good idea at all, why would she go to the owner for such a minor issue. My coworker just shrugged and said she's staying out of it.

&#x200B;

Just now, I was in a conference call with some of our manufacturers and my boss. After the call ended, my boss asked me about my project and how it's coming along. We eventually got to the conversation on how I was going to implement her suggestion on fixing the payment schedule and that's when I told her what my coworker had told me earlier this morning. She asked me who specifically was planning on going to the Owner to discuss this and I told her it was Lea. She said she appreciated me telling her and immediately called down to the service department to talk to Lea's manager. 

&#x200B;

I don't know if Lea's going to be in trouble for this but I feel like I probably should've kept my mouth shut because I basically threw Lea under the bus . Keep in mind, Lea is a customer service representative so of course her only concern is how the customers are going to react to getting paid 10 days later than usual, instead of the main focus here which is trying to make the accounting for their department a lot more efficient. So personally I highly doubt the owner would take her opinion seriously in this situation anyways but I still feel very much like a tattle tale or ""teacher's pet"" if you will, by going to my boss and telling her about gossip. So am I the asshole for warning my boss some one was planning on undermining her?"	Asshole	0	0

&#x200B;

I work in an administrative office for a medical supply company. Recently our office arrangements have moved around, and my room is shared between myself, my friend Donna, and two hispanic women.  Now, both of these women are fluent in english, and have been with our company for over a decade. Since we've moved offices, the two hispanic women,  who are also friends, have started speaking spanish to one another at work. This didn't bother Donna or I until we realized that they were talking about us. (when i asked how she knew, she said that they would glance over while saying certain things/laughing. IE they were glancing at my mom and her friend when she over heard ""gringas"")

We asked them to stop, they of course denied talking about us and kept speaking spanish like before. Donna and I decided that we'd had enough and so when they would speak spanish in the office setting we would switch to pig-latin. This immediately set them off and said we shouldn't be using a made up language that they couldn't understand. We told them that was how we felt when they switched to spanish even though they were native english speakers. They argued that there was a difference between a language they grew up with vs a fake language. We disagreed because they were speaking a language specifically to exclude us first. But they kept speaking spanish so we kept speaking pig-latin. they went to HR today.

c2ldjp	2019-06-19 19:21:01	ThrowAwayForMeetDay	AITA For Distancing Myself From Several Depressed People...	" 

Lately, I've had to distance myself from some people because of their anxiety/depression, and am not sure if this makes me the asshole. Here are the cases:

1 - ExGF: We dated 6 months and are still friends. However, throughout the whole relationship she was overwhelmed with anxiety and would snap frequently. When her company imploded she fell into a depression. I stuck with her until she got a new job and was settled. But I couldn't deal with her depression and anxiety in my life... The final nail in the coffin was when she told me that I couldn't text her anymore, because she had panic attacks whenever anyone texted her.

2 - D: D was a trans man I met while dating ExGF (ExGF's idea. Everything was consensual). D was bipolar and suffered depression. He was married so it was just for fun, but eventually his depression started to weigh on me and our conversations turned from fun to therapy...The final straw was when he told me his volunteer work at the hospital satisfied his dominance kink because of how submissive and pathetic patients are...

3 - Boi: I met Boi off Grindr. Hes a great looking marathon runner, with a steady job and great personality. However his LTR boyfriend broke up with him a month prior. He frequently brought up his ex and said he would go take him back in a heartbeat. He'd also texting me things like 'Spent all night crying ;\_; How are you this morning?'. I told him that killed any sexual attraction, but he replied with a 'I hope we can still be friends' accompanied by a very hairy butthole shot...

4 - Friendo: Friendo was roommates with my friend until his anxiety, depression, passive-aggressiveness and verbal abuse drove her away. This left Friendo alone in an apartment he couldn't afford. We hang out a-lot and talk frequently, but I am now creating distance, due to his depression. Namely, he finally got roommates a week before he was homeless, and since then he has ranted about how horrible they are and how he's gunna ditch them without telling them.... Meanwhile he's withdrawing from people to dwell in anxiety, and isn't doing anything to fix the problems. The reason? Their cat peed in the kitchen... Meanwhile if this doesn't work, he's homeless...

5 - LTF: One of my oldest friends has depression and high anxiety. 8 years ago we were supposed to move in together, but he backed out. As a result I went through some of the roughest times of my life, including mob roommates, crazy druggie house drama and a very close call with homelessness. Meanwhile all he ever did was dwell in depression and talk to me about his ex. We had a falling out, and while we stayed friends, I keep him at arms length.

6 - ExFiance - I won't go into much detail, but she suffered high anxiety and depression. After I proposed and bought her a house she started sneaking around with a pirate and everything just sort of imploded from there...

&#x200B;

I'm currently a 20 year old uni student, its summer break and I'm doing an internship while staying at my parents place.

&#x200B;

About 2 days ago, after work, I went to pick up my mother because we had some appointment. She tells me that the left side of her face feels weird. She says it feels almost numb and tingly. I get worried because to my knowledge that could be the sign of a stroke. I rush her to a walk-in-clinic. Doctor takes a look and says she's fine. My mom wants a second opinion so we go to another doctor, a family friend. The doctor's at home so we go there. The doctor says it may be Bell's Palsy and says she should stay a night just so my mother can be monitored. I stay with her until I have to go home because I have work the next day. The next day, after work I go to meet my girlfriend we decide we're going to meet the day after too. Also my mom ends up staying another night.

&#x200B;

Today I get a text from my mom saying she's coming home today. We talk and my plans with my girlfriend comes up. My mom starts saying she can't believe or understand why I'm going out when she's going home today. She says either my girlfriend is being super inconsiderate or I am being a bad son.

&#x200B;

This isn't the first time this has happened. She always accuses me of prioritizing my relationship over family. Reddit, am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

TL;DR Mom's coming back home after staying at a friend/doctor's place because she may have Bell's Palsy, calls me a bad son for planning on going on a date with my girlfriend the same day.

c2lbhq	2019-06-19 19:16:37		AITA for telling my [F24] boyfriend [M22] to appreciate his work	"My boyfriend is still in school and I am recently graduated working full time. The program he is in is very tough and extremely stressful for him. You need at least an 80% to pass without any curves and apparently this is supposed to be the hardest class in the program, so the overwhelming attitude from most students is to do whatever it takes to just pass. However, he is a bit of a perfectionist and always gets upset if he doesn't get 100%, basically it's always an ""I'm disappointed I didn't do better"" no matter what attitude. Whereas when I was in school I was always able to be satisfied with my score as long as it was a passing grade.

&#x200B;

His first test of this class a month or so ago he ended up failing in the high 70s. Not the end of the world but you can imagine how upset he was about that. The next couple of tests he passed with high 80s or low 90s and was still not satisfied because it wasn't an A+. I was there to be supportive and listen to him vent, but I also tried to point out that it is still very good to be scoring this high on the tests in this class and how he had almost completely made up for messing up on the first test.  

&#x200B;

On the most recent test the other day he scored in the low 90s again. I was super happy for him as this was the last test before the Final and at this point it's almost guaranteed that he passes the class unless he gets like a 60% on the final. Except when I talked to him he was still upset about the score and was complaining about he frustrated he is with himself and how he wanted to get in the high 90s. Now at this point I am kind of frustrated with him because he is literally refusing to appreciate the work he is putting in and how successful he is being in this class. I told him this very kindly, but he wasn't having it and was just saying how he wasted all of that time studying and working. I'm getting a bit more snappy now, but I reiterated the same point again. He reiterates his point and adds that he wanted to get a 98-100%.  Now, with a little bit more sass, I tell him that I want to make $1million a year, but don't cry every time I get a paycheck and that I'm appreciative of the money I work for. 

&#x200B;

He's upset with me for not being understanding and not trying to make him feel better. I basically said that there's nothing I can do to try to make him feel better after these tests when he isn't appreciating the work he's doing in the first place. I don't think I did anything wrong besides maybe be a little bit sassy in my tone, but I was just so frustrated. I would've been thrilled to get those grades in my hardest class of my program when I was in school, so it's hard for me to have empathy in that situation. AITA?"		1	0

c2lb1i	2019-06-19 19:15:34	AlcertDamus	AITA for wanting not to move?	"Issue: mom wants to move back to hometown Chance of moving: 100%

Background: I’m a second year student in a relatively decent program at a decent school. My mom has decided we as a family are moving back to my hometown. Why this is a problem: I’ll have to move back with them. Why: strict family, culturally frowned upon for a girl to live on her own. My view: genuinely don’t think I’d be able to live on my own. Trust me I know it sounds bad but look at the facts: I come from a sheltered background codependency on my parents has been instilled in me and feelings of shame/guilt if I don’t trust their plan whatever it might be. Now here’s the problem: if it was a genuine reason I’d not put up a fight. It’s not. It’s a whim or I believe so. See we moved here a year ago during October, two months in to senior year, on a whim. We just packed up our bags on a dark night and left all we’d known. Prior to that I hadn’t believed my parents when it became clear to me that it was a happening I had begged my mother to not move. See I was a senior in high school, a crucial time. I had friends, I had become accustomed to my school, the curriculum might be different at my new high school. My mom didn’t care. We moved. It was fine. It was fine even though I had no friends, no support system, didn’t know the school, hated every single second spent in that brown building. I did it I, graduated. I buried the pain of knowing that I ate every single lunch alone, that i missed the chance of going to prom with my friends or grad for that matter, that I hated myself. Ok enough of my teenage angst. At the end I prevailed, I graduated top of my class got scholarships the whole nine yards. A year later I’m still adjusting to the new town and my university, I’m doing fine. Throughout the year my mum had no friends, she was alone and a few of our community members were catty to her. She doesn’t feel like she belongs. I get trust me, I do. What I don’t get is the way she springs it on us. I can’t say anything, they don’t care what I think. So here I am probably going to move back to a hometown and a life I’ve already grieved. Here I am wishing that they’d listen to me. At least next year let us stay. I’d save up enough money and gather the courage to live on my own. But they don’t care and so I’m moving."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Also I'm on mobile and not a native speaker so if there are any formating issues or grammar mistakes I'm terribly sorry. 

But first a little bit of ""pre-information"": My sister(16 F) is bisexual and I'm(19 M) not really sure yet but most of my friends just call me asexual (important later) because I've never had any sexual attraction to anybody I've met/seen. 

Anyway let's begin with the story: This happened just about an hour ago. My sister came into my room to tell me about her day. We start with some pretty casual stuff (grades, tests etc.) but then comes the big bad thing.

My sister just tells me that she is beginning to ""question"" the bisexuality of one of her female classmates. Apparently she felt some real chemistry between her and mentioned classmate and they were kind of playfully flirting with each other.

But after ~ 3-4 weeks of ""flirting"" her classmate went on to try her luck with some of the boys of her class and my sister just told me that she thinks that her classmate isn't a real bisexual because she's ""just chasing after boys"".

I was of course shocked by what I had just heard. Especially because my sister is part of the LGBTQ+ community. I tried to explain to her that bisexuals don't need to prove their sexual orientation. (Just like any other sexual orientation) 

Our argument went forth and back for a little bit and came to it's climax when she told me that she should have known that I ""couldn't understand"" her because I've never even experienced ""a thing like that"". To which I responded that she is acting irrational and is just pissed because she got ""rejected"" (Even though you can hardly even call it rejection, because all it was based on was some ""playful flirting"" and nothing more).

She just started to hurl insults at me (you're an asshole, you're family, you should back me up etc. etc.) and then in the heat of the moment I just called her a ""Nice-Girl"" which brought forth more insults.

At first I was sorry for calling her a Nice-Girl but the longer I think about it, the more justified I feel. But since I could be completely biased I'm asking you dear people of the Reddit world.

So I don't drive (anxiety thing, please let's focus here, dont want suggestions on that). 

I go to a doc who is part of a chain of medical centers in my city. I like her for a lot of reasons: takes time with me, draws charts to explain stuff, doesn't dumb things down, doesn't nag me about being overweight (positive reinforcement when I do lose weight--she knows I'm aware I could lose some), good sense of humor, tries to find practical health solutions for me.

My husband hates that I go there bc it's like a 15-20 drive. When I was unemployed a few years ago, he got mad about driving me for a needless expense/waste of his time. He pressured me to change, I meant to, forgot when I got back in a job.

Then Lyft happened. Yay lift! He didnt notice I'd kept her, and I thought 'and, I'll Lyft'. And I have been. Until today,  bc he INSISTS lyft is also a waste (hes on summer break)
This argument would be over by now, but I literally last week found out I have diabetes. (Not really from being all that fat, I found out I'd lost 20 lbs the same day!) I'm nervous, I feel like as failure, etc etc. I want to stay with a dr I trust. 
Hubs is angrily driving to get me right now.  I know it's an inconvenience to drive this far. 
Am I the asshole for wanting to keep this dr, even if the Lyft fare is 30 round trip and hubs hates driving here (but also hates spending money)?


Update: fully acknowledge I'm being a drama queen bc I'm pissed I have this. It's not my first chronic illness -- I had ulcerative colitis, have level 4 endometriosis, neurofibromatosis, I'm crazy (shorter than typing diagnoses.) This is, however, the only chronic illness I have that will lead my family to judge/lecture/generally be unhelpful about, so I have to keep it a secret from them and my in laws. I hate secrets , but my friends are cool and I've told them.

Here's what happened: 
Hubs: why are you even there? 
Me: bc I really like my doc
Him: you *said* you were changing , but just forgot. 
Me: dont remember saying that.
Him: you absolutely did.
Me: whatever, I'm not a stenographer, I like her and I'm keeping her. 
(Mutual click) 
Hes autistic. His recall for what people say is freaky. I'm not. I forget what I said sometimes. He feels this is lying. 
But the important thing is he now understands why I want to stay with her and hasn't said anything about future transportation. I'll save us the headache and pay the Lyft in the future."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2l79c	2019-06-19 19:07:05		AITA for refusing to serve a customer with a nut allergy?	"I work at an ice cream parlour. We have thorough allergy warning signs posted all around our freezers that every single ice cream we serve is processed in a facility that also handles nuts, so none of it can be considered “nut free”. 

We do, however, have an entire line of sealed chocolates that ARE peanut free because they are manufactured in a peanut free warehouse. 

A mother and her young son approach the freezer and begin to discuss flavours. Her first question was “which flavours are nut free?”

I outlined the nut policy and redirected her to the many warning signs. 

She said “yeah, but plain vanilla obviously doesn’t have nuts in it.”

I said “Can I ask why you’re inquiring?”

She said “my son has a nut allergy, but it’s fine, he’ll have a scoop of the vanilla.”

I stood there wearing a fly-catching gape for a second. 

I said “Ma’am, the ice cream is not nut free.”

She said “He’s fine. Just scoop it for him.” 

I said “Is he going to die?”

And she said, “no, he just gets a rash and his throat gets itchy. It’s fine, just scoop it.” 

This child didn’t look much older than 6 or 7... certainly not old enough to have a lifetime of experience with how severe the allergy is. The whole interaction did not sit right with me, so I refused to scoop it for him. (Plus isn’t “just an itchy throat” actually kind of a serious symptom? I dated someone with a nut allergy and that feeling would have him grabbing for the epipen... maybe i’m wrong, but i’d appreciate some insight.) 

She said “Are you serious? Fine. She says no ice cream for you,” to her kid and got herself a scoop. 

Everyone I’ve told this story to insists that I should have just served her and he’s her kid so it’s her choice. 

Personally, I didn’t really give a damn and I wasn’t about to risk this little kid going into anaphylactic shock on the floor because his mom insists “he’s fine”. 

My boss said it’s within my right to make that call, but she said she also would have just served them and let the mother deal with the fallout. 

I strongly disagree, and I would feel personally responsible if things went south. Was I an asshole?"		1	0
c2l78n	2019-06-19 19:07:02		WIBTA if I ask DH to stop letting ex wife continue seeing the dog they used to have together, but she gave up custody.	"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

DH has been divorced from his ex wife for a 3 years now. DH and I are married and live together with a dog he and his ex wife raised together. I am now the adoptive mother.

&#x200B;

DH is an amazing person, albeit too nice of a guy where nothing really phases him. His ex wife doesn't live in our city but does visit from time to time as her parents live here. So every now and then DH will tell me ""ex-wife is in town so she is going to spend some time with Dog. I will drop Dog off and blah blah blah"". He basically already made arrangements before coming to me about it cause he knows it's a touchy subject.

&#x200B;

DH told me his divorce agreement says he gets 100% custody of the dog.

&#x200B;

For some context, a while back, DH and I got into an argument about balancing home responsibilities and how I was taking on way more than DH. He agreed to do better on most points but at the start, countered my feelings by saying ""well I take care of the dog"" and I said, ""if we split the dog bills/chores right down 50/50 would you allow me to have a say in whether or not your ex-wife is allowed to see Dog? She doesn't have any responsibility for Dog but reaps all the benefits"". He didn't have much to rebuttal but said ""well, we could talk about it as it happens"". At the time I didn't know what to say but still felt shitty cause his answer made me think that he would still allow ex-wife to be around and I would have to just deal with it.

&#x200B;

Struggling with whether I'm in a position to ask him to stop or should just leave it. It seems as though he is willing to accommodate every time she is in town, but that being said, he may never even bring it up to me when their schedules don't line up, so who know's what his batting average is. I love this dog, don't get me wrong. I am just frustrated that when ex wife shows up it seems to be all arranged and I am here to accept what has been done. It's not that the dog comes with me to work (dog goes with DH to work), or DH is allowing ex-wife to take away time from me with Dog, but it's more the principle, that the ex-wife stays involved in his life. A lot of my friends (females) feel that DH and ex wife should end communication, it's not like there is a joint custody rule or it's human kids, it's a dog. Some of his best friends can't even stand the thought of her. Maybe I'm getting too worked up by what everyone has told me? Ex-wife is bound to visit more in the future and as we get further into our married lives and potentially, kids, I don't know how much more of this I can handle.

Anyway, she’s hugely scared of the “diverse” outside world (see above (lol. Karen)) and I’m taking her to classes to work through this. One of the classes focused on exposing your dog to the “trigger” in controlled setting (and then treating your dog whenever they look at the “scary” thing).

Long story out, my group of friends were chatting and asked how dog training was going. So, I told them (note – there are two black friends but neither wear hoodies, afros and tbh, their skin is more of a deep tan than super dark so Karen never really had a problem with them).

Anyway, they found out that I was going to black neighborhoods so my dog and I can people watch and I got called a racist asshole.

I tried to explain - I could just wander around town hoping that a black person shows up but it makes more sense (to me) to go where I know there will be a higher population. I tried to explain and may have also mentioned how Karen got her name. Double asshole.

Honestly, I don’t see this as a huge deal but they were absolutely certain. 

So, reddit, AITA?

Edit: For clarification - I am doing this according to what the trainers suggested.  She has not bitten nor shows signs of biting. She cowers or tries to run away when overwhelmed.

According to the trainers, they think she was chased by people with those features or harmed by them. They suggest many ways to get her over the fear, and we are now at the stage where we just need to expose her (literally) to black people doing normal things. Aka, we sit at a park and she looks at black people and she gets treats. So she creates an association that black =/= danger. 

And, instead of wandering around trying to find one, I'll go to a park where I know the demographic is predominantly black. And, while we are still working through this...it really has helped her. She started off super skittish but now other than tensing if someone black/wearing a hoodie gets too close...she's mostly ok.

Second edit: I'm not throwing her in a situation she can't handle. I'm not walking up to black people asking for them to help with her ""therapy"". And I'm not exposing her to toddlers or children. 

We are sitting in a quiet area of the park, waiting for black people to walk past so I can give her a treat when she looks at them."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2l4lk	2019-06-19 19:01:13	thepinkestchu	AITA for giving a freeloading houseguest clean pee	"Sorry on mobile. 

My husband and I have a friend, C. We've been friends with him for 15+ years. 

A few years ago he went on a downhill spiral and was not in a good place. He lost his job, lost his apartment, almost lost his car. He began talking about moving to the area we live in to start over. We said cool, but you arent staying here and you need a plan. So, hearing our words, he showed up at 2am during a storm saying he needed a place to crash for the night. (This was about 5 months ago.) I could write paragraphs on all that's happened, but we will leave it at hes been staying rent free since and we have had to hold his hand on each step of being an adult. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I've had it. We sit down and I say he needs a workable budget and a 2nd job, 1 base income isnt enough for him to be on his own. I tell him I've had enough, and he has 4 weeks to get a 2nd job or I'm kicking him out. Husband is on the same page as me. 

C gets a few interviews, finds a 2nd job that will work and still give him a day off each week. It's a great 2nd job. He does both interviews, all he has to do is pass a drug test. Weed is legal in this state, and he as well as my husband enjoy it every so often. C isnt worried, figuring it's a mouth swab test and he hasn't smoked in a week. 

Husband goes out of town on business. C is suppose to take his test the next day and realizes it's a pee test, and he wont pass. Hes freaking out. He does have a device that will hide clean pee on your body, but he knows no one that doesnt smoke. He first asks if I can get my 5yo to pee in a cup for him, and i tell him no in not nice terms. I then relent and inform him I dont do anything and can pee clean. Long story short, he gets clean pee, gets the job.

Husband comes home last night and I fill him in and hes furious at me. His reasoning is that C knew that he'd probably have to do drug tests and this is part of growing up and being an adult. That C should have not smoked weed this whole time just in case. And that me providing a clean test is enabling him. I get it, he needs to grow up. But my reasoning is I want him out of my house and this helps make it happen. Under any other circumstances I wouldnt have helped. Hell, he didnt even know I didnt smoke weed.

c2l3h6	2019-06-19 18:58:50	Libdeh	AITA for baking a non-vegan cake?	"Okay, so this may sound silly, but I'm starting to have alot of anxiety about excluding some people through my thoughtlessness.

I go to my local Zen Center alot, and I'm the kitchen manager when we have special events. I frequently (think 3-6x per month) bring homemade baked goods like artisan bread and cakes and such. 

Usually I bake an extra vegan item so that the 3-6 vegans who come to the center have something delicious too. 

Today I forgot... I baked this elaborate cremé patisserie vanilla cake which is filled with eggs and milk and butter, but no vegan option. I don't have time to bake anything else, so if I am TA I'll just not bring the cake so nobody feels left out. It's not a special event, just a regular Wednesday meditation night, but I still feel guilty. 

So, am I an asshole for forgetting my vegan friends?


Edit: Well I tried to go buy some store-bought vegan treats but the bakery was empty. Not closed, just nobody there. As it happens though, none of the vegans stayed after meditation so I didn't have to explain my lapse in consideration to them. I appreciate everyone's opinions and input."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2l1yp	2019-06-19 18:55:29		AITA for wanting to change job location, because I don't like the new employer?	"Basically, the title says it all. 

I've not been in my current job that long, but it's been long enough that I've settled well. Long enough to have gotten to know the staff there and I think they're all lovely people. However, today I went into my shift and a new person showed up. It was her first week. I already recognised her. I used to live a few doors, down the street, from her. I don't like her. 

It's nothing personal, at all. She just comes across as stuck up. You can tell she thinks she is the bees knees and she is already walking around like she owns the work place. My partner's family know her (she doesn't know me so doesn't really know I know this) but we have mutual friends. I've heard stories about her, where she basically does everything she can, for attention from men. Do you know when you just don't like someone? It's that. 

I don't want to work with her. 

I have a few options..

1. Be professional, suck it up and work with her and probably start to dislike the job, up until now I have loved. 

2. Speak to my boss and ask her to transfer me to another shop. 

My boss will probably think I'm an arsehole, will probably tell everyone why I want to leave. The thing is, I'm a people pleaser and I hate pissing people off. So, even the thought of speaking to my boss is giving me extreme anxiety.

c2l1mm	2019-06-19 18:54:45	whyistherenousernam	WIBTA if I sent my professor an email telling him he was disrespectful?	"Here me out. I’m am taking a pretty difficult class during the summer, which lasts only 4 weeks. Hence the class being very overwhelming and difficult to understand. 

&#x200B;

Because this is a very difficult class, our professor makes appointments instead of having regular office hours.  So, I had made an appointment with him so he could help me one-on-one after class. I have to make it directly after class because then I have to head to work and can’t be late. 

&#x200B;

So then comes the day of our appointment and waited for him so we could head to the office hours. But oh I was wrong. About 20 people started forming a line to ask questions and he explained every single one. 

&#x200B;

I don’t mind the professor helping other people, but it just makes no absolute sense to make an appointment when he doesn’t even respect that. I waited an hour before I decided to leave. I wanted to stay because I didn’t want to be disrespectful and leave him stranded. However I did leave because I was absolutely livid and knowing myself I would have snapped if I actually talked to him. So I decided to leave so I wouldn’t make the situation worse.

&#x200B;

The problem here is I told him right after class we had office hours, so he definitely knew I had made an appointment, but still helped the other students first. What angers me the most is the lack of respect for my time and the fact that I wasted over an hour that I could have done other things.

&#x200B;

I wanted to send him an email explaining why I left office hours. I wanted to mention how I thought it was very unprofessional the way he acted. I want to send the most respectful I can, but I don’t know if I will come off as an asshole. 

&#x200B;

I’m sorry if I come off as aggressive but at the moment I am pretty mad as it just happened.

I've been getting texts every morning from the same number for about a week now. They're just your standard scam, very obvious. ""Hey beautiful, Amazon will send you a gift card if you fill out this survey"" yadda yadda. And yes, it says beautiful. Every. Morning.

I had nothing better to do today, so I looked up the phone number, realized it's probably not a burner number for somebody, and decided to spam them. ETA: when I called it later it was obvious it's not a burner number.

I spent about an hour texting them petty things (I hope reincarnation is real so that you can come back as a stinkbug and get stuck to the bottom of someone's shoe, I hope you hit every red light whenever you're trying to get somewhere important, I hope your favorite song is just ending every time you get into your car, etc.). I also called them a million times and hung up just to make it ring, and I signed the phone number up for some really interesting services.

I tried to call the phone number just now and it's been disconnected. Yes, I'm sure this was someone's actual phone number.

I love my gf, but she's really organized and has her shit together, while I'm admittedly kind of a lazy turd. She's been helping me get my life on track (credit score, bills, etc.) and she writes out a list of things for me to do on the whiteboard. Well, long story short, I spent Monday playing video games instead of accomplishing anything, and about 45 minutes before she got off work, I started hurrying to get stuff done. Of course I didn't get everything done by the time she got home (big city traffic still screws with me), and she was annoyed when she got home. That part, I know I should've actually been doing chores. 

During dinner, she started saying that she wasn't exactly mad at me, she was more annoyed that I hadn't accomplished anything major with my day off. She said that on her days off, she really doesn't have any layabout down-time. I know that I'm lazy, but I really didn't want to hear it. That really ticked me off, and as she was saying that I need to think more about using my time, I simply said, ""I'm gonna go.""

c2kx6l	2019-06-19 18:45:07	Hanotaux	WIBTA if I called a store and chewed them out (potentially getting someone fired) for taking my email without my knowledge?	"This one is pretty simple. I went to a big chain office supply company the other day to print out a couple copies of my resume to bring to an interview. The guy at the printing station asked for my phone number to enter into the system. I figured it was the sort of thing they had to do if you had a large print job and they had to call you when it was done so I obliged. I never gave any other information. At the time he had also made a comment about my college major, all the way at the bottom of the page, which I found kind of odd.

This morning I received an email from the store (which I’ve never done any previous business with before) asking me to fill out a survey about my purchase. It was sent to my email that I specifically use for my job search and other important things. Even if I had forgotten that I had given an email, I certainly wouldn’t have given this one.

I know it’s not a huge deal - I can just unsubscribe from all future emails, but I feel weirdly violated. This guy I don’t know had clearly read through my resume which has a lot of personal information on it. Luckily, I don’t have my full address on the page, just town and state.

WIBTA if I called the location and went off about how unacceptable this is. I don’t know if this is something the guy could get fired over and that’s not my goal. For all I know his boss told him to get all information possible when doing print jobs and he was just following orders. 

Or should I just let it be, unsubscribe, and move on?

FaceTimed my bf yesterday while we were both on lunch at work. He works in a hospital and I work in an office. It should also be noted that said hospital is in an extremely rural area, and there are not many staff members nor patients. 
Anyway, I was alone in the break room, as was he. He spoke to nobody else during the call or even acknowledged anybody else during the call. I think we’re all guilty of talking to our SOs in private a little differently than we would in front of other people. Not necessarily dirty, but more along the lines of saying silly things, using dumb made up words the two of you frequently use together, saying some things in a “baby” voice (i frequently talk to him this way, as he does me. He actually did it for a good couple weeks when we started dating before I did it back) Most of our conversation he was a complete dick to me. He acted like he had better things to do than be talking to me, so I asked several times what was wrong, and each time he said nothing. 
Lunch comes to an end so I proceed to say goodbye and get ready to hang up. I get a “talk to you later, bye”. No “I love you, have a good day”, nothing. 
Receive a text from him and he is clearly aggravated at me, because of the way I talked to him. Apparently there were a couple other colleagues around him, and he said I embarrassed him, he was mad at me for it, etc. He said I should have known he was not alone. 
I don’t see it that way. I think he could have let me know he wasn’t by himself instead of having a 30 minute private conversation in the middle of an occupied lunch area. If he didn’t want to blatantly say “hey, there’s other people in here”, he could’ve simply said hi to a coworker, asked how they were, nodded at them, waved, something, ANYTHING to let me know they were there. I would have gotten the hint. Nope. He continued to let me go on like an idiot and bitch at me about it later. We are still arguing about this today.

c2kvcq	2019-06-19 18:40:58		AITA for expecting money from my girlfriend?	"Okay, please read before making a judgement. 

My gf has provided for us both financially for 2 years. I work part time in a cafe and she works full time in a high stress environment. I really appreciate the amount of blood sweat and tears that's gone into us having the lifestyle we have. She's not flashy, drives a basic car and saves her money except for taking the occasional holiday with me. 

She was adopted at age 5. Had a hard life, moved home a lot and as a result is quite weird about money as it's been something that's always gone quicker than it came for her. 

It's like something from a film but her maternal mother died 6 months ago, took them a while to find my daughter but it turns out she's the beneficiary of £5million left to her my her maternal mother, who she never met. Or at least doesn't remember at all as she was taken from her aged 1. 

Girlfriend wasn't that phased by it and just seemed stressed. She said it was too much money and she didn't really want her mother's money but hey, we have it now. 

She got a financial advisor and counselling surrounding the death of her mother and is desperate not to waste it so she put £4mill into savings to invest/save for the future and gave herself £1mil to ""enjoy"" - she bought a £150,000 house in the city we wanted to move to, booked a long holiday and bought a cheap but new car as hers was beat up to fuck and unreliable. 
After all this, of the £1mil, she is left with £650,000 and £4mil in the bank. 

I asked her to buy me a new car and she did, which I really appreciate. Then, she was away with work and I bought myself a few bits, totalling about £3,000, using her debit card. 

She got home and gave me shit for spending ""her money"" and said if I spend £3,000 enough, we'll get through the money something rapid. I told her that I would share with her if the shoe was on the other foot and she said that she is sharing it as I live in the house, have a car and have been on holiday. I told her that being stingy isn't attractive. 

She told me I no longer have her permission to spend a penny and where we used to split all money 50/50, she's seperated what I earn and is only letting me access that. Not only is she not sharing her fortune, she's actually gone back on a system that worked for years. Now I have like £200 to live off a week whilst she gets her full time wage on top of what she has saved. She told me if I complain then I'll be expected to pay toward bills, food, etc. It's insane, she's a literal millionaire but wants me to buy food?! 

AITA? Were on the edge of breaking up over this. I need advice. 

**TL;DR** Gf got £5mil inheritance. Usually very generous, the money has gone to her head and she's cutting me back financially."		1	0

Because I'm a nice person, I said that my little sister (she's almost 16, so not ""that"" little) and her Bestie could come too, which would make us a party of 7 people. We borrowed a big 7 seater van and I volunteered to be the driver. 
Friend 1, who initially came up with the idea of going to said theme park, canceled today because she was invited to an important event. Of course I was kinda sad that the one friend who actually came up with the idea couldn't come with us, but I decided to drive anyway. Soon, friend 2 canceled, because she didn't want to go to the theme park without friend 1. My boyfriend then canceled because he realized that he had an important test to study for. I still thought ""kinda sucks, but it's okay since I've still got friend 3"".

Then, just an hour later, friend 3 called me and complained how boring the theme park actually was (she was really hyped just a day earlier), called everyone above the age of 18 who still goes to theme parks immature and childish etc. That got me mad and sad at the same time. I really love this friend, and hearing this from their mouth made me sad since I actually love theme parks, especially roller coasters.

So, at this point it was just me, my sister, her Bestie and our (now useless) borrowed van. I talked to my sister and her friend about it and we all agreed to cancel the trip. I then told my parents that I had canceled the trip and they now tell me that I'm a huge asshole for promising my sister a trip to the theme park and then canceling it last minute, calling my decision to cancel the trip just because my friends couldn't go with me selfish. I'm really unsure whether or not I'm really the asshole here. According to myself and my sister, I'm not, but according to my mom I'm the worst person ever right now. My mom also told me that my sister and her Bestie are secretly very angry at me and are very disappointed. I'm really unsure if this is true, since both told me that they didn't care all that much (they could just drive themselves if they wanted to go there so badly tbh), but if it is then it makes me feel even more guilty.

I now decided to take my sister and her friend to the theme park, but I won't go with them since it just isn't as fun alone as it is with friends and my sister would really prefer to be alone with her friend. As I said, my sister and her friend could just drive by themselves since her friend owns a motorcycle and it's not that far, but my mom said taking them there is the least I could do to make up for my mistake.

 I just really want to know what others think about this since my friends are obviously a bit biased towards me."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2kshc	2019-06-19 18:34:22		AITA for not caring if my grandparents die?	"My grandparents joined a small religious cult well before I was born. They had 6 kids, raised them in the cult. It would fly under the radar in terms of being picked up by the media but it has a really sketchy past, it functioned similarly to JW except it was even more severe. You couldn't have any friends outside the 3,000 worldwide followers AND you had to marry within the ranks. 

My grandfather had a really dominating attitude, he would get personally offended and hold grudges if one of his kids didn't abide by his advice and suggestions. When my dad was in his mid-twenties, he married a woman from the church that none of them liked (my mom) ...and not the daughter of a family friend (also in the church), who my dad had no attraction to. They didn't receive an engagement gift or congratulations. My mom had lost her parents, and it was a really rough start for her to marry into a family who didn't like her. It explained why she always seemed quiet and kept to herself at events during my childhood.

We would attend family events and I would always feel like we were being mocked because my dad was slowly turning into the 'black sheep' of the family. He chose to live in a different area of the city than the rest of the family and ended up tripling the value of his house... and that seriously bothered some of my uncles. He invested in my moms side of family which was a big no-no. My cousins made remarks about my dads weight and how annoying my mom was.... in front of me. They would call my dad ""gross"" and a ""fat loser"". I used to go home and cry because I didn't want to tell my mom and dad hurt their feelings. It was honestly a very painful childhood. I felt hated for reasons i didn't understand. 

Later on, my grandpa abruptly left the church (kind of, he started his own branch of the same screwed up system). Nearly all the extended family left the church at that point. From that point him and my grandmother began intentionally forgetting me and my brothers birthdays, they stopped inviting us to events and treated my dad as dead. My dad has done a ton for his parents, he kept their business afloat, sacrificed decades of his life to it and was effectively used by them to retire early. He seemed to hope they would come around.

 My parents were the last to leave the church.  I thought things would change but it became clear to me that the church was simply an excuse to effectively shun my dad from the family permanently. They felt justified finally.

To to sum up, Every time I've seen my grandparents i've behaved like a pathetic idiot, I sucked up to them so much. But they do not want to cultivate a relationship despite preaching christian jargon. For the last 25 years this has been a source of pain for me. They are currently ailing in their health and my relatives are all freaking out about it, but frankly, i dont think im going to care much if they die, I dont want them to die, i just dont care. But a part of me feels like a sociopath for thinking so."		1	0

c2koun	2019-06-19 18:26:32		AITA for snapping back and calling my mom inconsiderate and rude?	"I live at home with my family being that I’m preparing for school. From my and my sister’s perspective, everything our mother did/does for us is conditional. Everything came with a catch. 
Us:“Mommy can I have some lunch money (40 cents)?”
 Her: “ you have to clean out my car.” 

Us: “ can I go to so and so’s house?”
Her: “clean out my closet, and I’ll think about it.”

I beg mommy for a pair of shoes. Mommy buys them, but says I can’t wear them for 2 months for absolutely no reason. 

If we needed something,she’d take care of it, but would throw in our face what she does for us. It has always been me, my mother, and my sister growing up, and my mother didn’t have any help, But she made things very difficult. She did the bare minimum. we would go out to eat, we couldn’t order any food. She would say it was punishment for something random that we did or ask us, as children, if we had any money. She also didn’t cook, so most nights my sister and I ate TV dinners, or ate at a friend/family member’s house. She has always acted like we were the ones that made her decision to get pregnant or not get an abortion. she is somewhat verbally abusive and very critical. She calls us stupid, dingbat, fat (just me). A few times she’s called me a whale or a slut as a teen. she’s gotten better over the years, but she still has most of these problems. She never admits fault either. 

So now, as an adult, I try to see my mom’s perspective, and try to help her out when I can. I do a lot for the household by cooking, providing toiletries, buying groceries, doing everyone’s hair when they ask, making skincare products for my mom and her scalp (she’s balding) and contributing monetarily when I can. I do a lot. My mother acts like she’s always having to do for us and we never help out. 

I have bought gifts for her birthdays that she’s mentioned that she wants over the years, as tokens of appreciation, like a new computer and a bigger phone because she can’t see well. Whenever she complains about no one doing for her or helping her, I say what about the gifts or stuff I do around the house. She says “ I didn’t ask for that!” But she still uses whatever it is that she didn’t ask for. I find this incredibly rude and inconsiderate and she doesn’t see the issue. I ask her, if that’s the case, why don’t you give the stuff back because apparently you don’t need it, but she doesn’t give it back. She just says she didn’t ask for It. 

When I cooked the other day, she got mad at me for taking up the kitchen, and I said “well I’m making a big meal for us, so obviously, I’m going to take up the kitchen.” She says again “ I didn’t ask for that” yet she’s the first one with a plate when the food is ready. 

Today we got in an argument and I went off on her. Am I an asshole for telling my mom she’s rude, inconsiderate, and unappreciative for saying I didn’t ask you to do what you do?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

When my son hit the one year mark my ex agreed to stop nursing. She stopped for about two months and then resumed after he had been fully weaned. She isn't producing milk and it's just for comfort or to delay his rising from bed in the am.

I've voiced my opinion that this is bad. I told her she's doing it for the wrong reason and it's a development and health concern. In my opinion, it is a crutch and it's not serving a purpose beyond comfort. I think it could delay his development and he never follows a sleep schedule for her. At my house, which is a nursing free zone, he sleeps fine and doesn't give me trouble. At worst, she's definitely not on the breastfeeding diet and medicine, alcohol, etc. could somehow hurt him, even though she isn't producing milk like she was when this was a full time thing. 

Her response to my gripe is that it's natural and I shouldn't shame her. Also, she says that he really wants to nurse and is aggressive about it. He's at the point where he can effectively ask for it.

I just moved into a new apartment complex with my fiancé about 2-3 weeks ago. Unlike any other building I’ve lived in, all the units are indoors and you punch in a passcode and walk upstairs to get to your apartment. Our neighbors left us a note on our door complaining that we (I) was too loud in the mornings when I close the door and walk downstairs to leave for work. I’ve never really encountered this problem before as the places I’ve lived before were all outdoor units and I guess maybe the sound travels differently? I’m going to try to be quieter, that’s fine, but AITA for feeling like it would have been nice for them to introduce themselves and speak to us directly about a problem rather than just leaving a passive aggressive note? No one’s really made an attempt to introduce themselves when they see us in the halls, I get the feeling everyone keeps to themselves, but I think maybe it’s a little weird they skipped trying to talk to us completely.

I didnt ghost him, we all still keep in touch, I dont hate the kid, I dont think he is annoying so i actively try to annoy him, in fact some of my best memories come from that family. its just that month i couldnt handle anything other than what i was doing, its hard to explain everything but in short i was dealing with a lot of crap that month. saying things like ""i was on the server but you were not there"" i admit is not the best thing to say and i could have said so many different things that would be better its just at the moment it is all i could come up with because my brain was already fried. i admit im in the wrong and im not defending myself, but i just wanted to let you guys know the personal side.

This was a few years ago when i was addicted to minecraft

Backstory, this 12 year old kid, i'll call him S is mentally disabled, im not entirely sure everything he has but i know a few things, he is 100% on the spectrum and they are wondering if he has a hint of asbergers, also he has a skin disease where everything is sensitive to him. Its not like i dont like this boy, i love spending time with him and his family, they are great people and he is a great and i can tell very creatively talented kid.

Basically this is when mine craft realms came out he just got the game on PC, he would use his dads phone to text me for tips on how to use it, (how to download maps and texture packs, ect), i never minded helping him. The only problem is after a bit of spending time with him you start to get drained, he requires a lot of attention and while i dont mind this usually as i said i get very tired very easy.

He texted me saying he just spent some of his allowance on a month of minecraft realms, i told him i was more than happy to play with him but on the inside i was crying because i knew i would so much rather do my own things on the game and not to mention i had to complete a lot of schooling. I didnt have the heart to tell them that so every time he asked me to play with him i would tell him i was busy doing something or say things like ""I was on the server but you where not"".

Anyway so I’m practicing my turns and such in a parking lot that’s mostly empty and she’s sitting in her car doing nothing. Not even attempting to back out. Which thank god cause I was about eight feet behind her. Anyway I move out of that parking lot and go to the gas station that’s connected and sit down for a bit since I was wanting to smoke so I do. She then pulls into the parking space closest to me since I was kinda close to the door. Sits in her car for a couple of minutes so I’m paying her no mind expect when she pulled in I saw her do it. She left about a four foot gap between her front bumper and the line. So she was sticking out quite a bit rear wise. I was done smoking so I stand up and grab my board as she’s getting out. Does her waddle a little bit after leaving her car lights on and windows down. In front of five or six people she says “If you so much as touch my car I’m going to fucking kill you.” I asked if she was talking to me. “Yes little fucker I am!” So I’m just like alright time to dip from the crazy shit. My mind didn’t let me get away without a quip so I say back “Maybe if you’d parked better I’d avoid your car but seeing as you’re sticking out farther then a semi that’ll be hard.” I then start to skate away. Problem solved right? Well I’m going down some back roads for good hills so I turn onto one and she’s turning onto it at the same time. She comes up behind me and honks her horn as loud as possible so I get off my board and look at her angrily. She revs her car then I grabbed my board and kept going. So when she tried to floor it past me I moved in front of her car and told her to stop. I called the cops on her and turns out she was driving on a suspended license. She also had weed and open alcohol in her car. So she got arrested for that. I don’t know AITA or is she the asshole?	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2kj6p	2019-06-19 18:14:15	anor4k	WIBTA if I denounced my college classmates for cheating?	"Context: I'm a business student at one of the top public (free, state owned) universities in brazil. We just had our final exams for the semester, and cheating was widespread. People were just sharing answers on the class-wide WhatsApp group and other groups created specifically for sharing answers during exams. 

I'm not sure if most teachers really are clueless that people are cheating or they don't care, but either way I am yet to see someone get punished or some sort of measure to prevent cheating during these exams. 

I wouldn't really care about all this, but your grades are one of the most important factors when applying for exchange programs, research grants, and other types of benefits, and sometimes even when looking for a job after you graduate. 

So I'm not sure if I'm just being a self-righteous asshole or actually doing the right thing, but I'm thinking about talking to the director or someone else in charge about what has been happening, because it's all so blatant but there are no consequences. **I don't intend to rat out specific people who cheated or to demand new exams**, I just want something do be done to end this ""cheating culture"".

"Last weekend some colleagues (about 3/4th of the team, which is around 8 people) came together  at a colleagues house to hang out, have some drinks and grill. I just got to know by seeing pictures of them hanging out and I was a bit angry that I wasnt invited. I am usually cool with everybody and there is no tension at all at work, it just turns out that some people like to hang out after-work more than others, especially those who moved from different cities and dont have a lot of friends/family here. I was born and raised here which means that I dont mind hanging out with colleagues after work at times, but usually like to rather meet with my private friends, respectively very rarely pro-actively ask them to hang out but rather join them when they do something fun and I am in the mood.

I was still a bit offended though that most of my team-members were invited, but not me. When I asked why nobody invited me, they just said ""well we thought you were busy, since you didnt come last time"". Sounded BS to me for not even asking just because I didnt come once and I am not a notorious nay-sayer either, so when it was my birthday yesterday, I didnt bring cake to work. Everyone was surprised because cake-day is kind of a big deal at work (and I mean the real deal, when someone has his birthday, they bring super expensive/creative cakes or bake two days straight several cakes with macarons and other shit on top), but I just said that I didnt have time for buying one, so no cake this year.

c2ki13	2019-06-19 18:11:42		AITA for wanting to spoil my friend’s surprise birthday party?	"Alright, everyone. Strap yourselves in, and get ready for some weird shit. Here’s what you need to know. Everyone mentioned is in their mid-late 20s. My wife and I (M) are poly. My wife very recently started dating a wonderful girl named (fake names all around) Roxxy. We somewhat recently met Roxxy through a close friend’s friend, so there’s three degrees of separation. Roxxy lives with her friend Hannah, who is the girlfriend of the friend’s friend from earlier, Beth. 

This weekend is Roxxy’s birthday; my wife and I love planning birthdays, and we love going hard for them. Roxxy tells us that she’s never actually gone out for her birthday, and she’d like to go wild - karaoke, strip club, the lot. We love it. 

So here’s the big issue, Hannah and Beth are planning a surprise party for Roxxy. In the following days it has gone from potentially mundane, to this is going to be the worst party ever. I won’t bore you with all the details, but it went from renting out a space in the park and grilling, to, and I kid you not, a small gathering at someone’s apartment pool, now with no food being provided, no drugs or alcohol can be used, and Beth is now bringing her extremely religious parents - that’s right, her parents, to her girlfriend’s roommate’s surprise birthday party. As I’m sure you can tell, this is a pretty gay/open minded gathering, and now tons of people are extremely put off, wondering wtf is Beth doing. 

We don’t know Roxxy, Hannah, or Beth super well, and we feel like our hands are kind of tied. We don’t want to be rude, and upset anyone, especially Roxxy. All the while, we feel awful for Roxxy having no clue what she’s going to be walking into, and that nothing she actually wants to do is being considered. 

My guess is - Beth is not a partier at all, and besides being gay, she’s a walking stereotype of upstanding Christian values - fine. She might be throwing herself into this party planning so we don’t have to do anything that’d make her uncomfortable. My even darker theory is Beth is trying to expose her parents to the queer community, or that Beth is using this as a coming out party for herself, but I think these are unlikely. 

Are we the assholes for wanting to spoil this whole thing, and take Roxxy out for an awesome night?"		1	0

c2khbn	2019-06-19 18:10:09	DaphosActually	AITA for wanting my (17M) mom (49F) to get a job?	"My parents used to make a pretty good living for themselves but due to some unfortunate circumstances, their business collapsed and lost most of their money. After that, mom had worked a part-time job at an elderly care home that in her own words ""would give her time to do her own business"", she only worked there for 3 months and then resigned as she thought it was too physically demanding and had long hours. My dad however, worked a few jobs over the years but none of which contributed significantly to our living expenses

&#x200B;

Our grandparents give my family (me, brother, mother) some money each week to pay for food and other living expenses and pay for all of our school fees, house rent, and any extracurricular activities that we need for our school. My mom often uses that money to buy things that are completely unnecessary such as clothes despite having 3 closets of it, crystals with ""healing properties"" claiming she is going to start a business with them when really they're just sitting on her desk looking shiny, and lots of lots of payments to her personal monk who she claims is protecting us from bad luck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So just now my mom was trying to calculate how much money she owes me as she had borrowed some from my wallet this morning, and she ended up being angry as she still owed my quite a bit of money. Then she complained to me about how our grandparents don't give us enough money regularly and are treating her very harshly. Then she asked me if I could go out and find a job soon, to which I asked her why she couldn't go find one herself, seeing as she's a parent and I'm still a person under her care. Then she gets quite angry at me and tells me that she isn't going to go find a job as she has no time, then I asked her why she was mad at her grandparents when really they shouldn't be the ones who are paying for our expenses, and that if anyone should find a job, it should be her. Then she screamed at me about how we wouldn't be receiving money from them if she weren’t here for us, which I thought was an extremely poor excuse to try to push the financial responsibilities of the family onto me.

&#x200B;

She literally does nothing at home except scroll through her phone or watches TV, she has a project that she claims she's working on but has so far not produced any money since she's started it. Although I am almost an adult, I believe that the financial responsibilities still lie upon the parents at least until I turn 18, she should be the one looking for a job so that she could provide for us and not blame it all on the people giving us money and the person who's at least trying his hardest to provide for us.

&#x200B;

TLDR: My parents are poor, money comes from semi-wealthy grandparents. Mom lazes around all day and does nothing. Mom complains that grandparents aren't giving her enough money and asks me to get a job, I don't want to cause I need time to build my resume for medical school.

At first I expected that only my parents and maybe my dad’s father (he was always very interested and supportive) would come. And honestly, these 3 would have been enough for me as I knew that the hall were the event was is quite limited space-wise. We are about 100 students in this year, and this room definitely can’t accommodate more than 400 people. I’m not really a big “celebration-guy” either, if you know what I mean. The fewer people the better.

My mom then told her parents about the ceremony and if they would like to come - which they did of course. Then my grandma told my aunt about it, who my mom then invited too. We were now at 6 people already and I didn’t want even more. My mom apparently didn’t consider inviting my sister (she’s 25 btw) either, as she almost never comes to any family gatherings.

Now my sister texted me and asked why she wasn’t invited and that she felt a bit “left-out”, which I totally understand. I apologized and tried to explain her that our mom started to invite all the people mentioned above and that we were already more than enough. She understood that and is now pissed at our mom because she didn’t invite her. Our mom told her that she should have “invited herself, like the others did” (which I think is a bit ridiculous). Now our mom suggested that we 3 should go out for dinner to celebrate, but I don’t think that my sister wants to accept that.

They keep on insisting that I am the asshole. I don't think I'm seeing the full picture. Am I the asshole for disagreeing with them? I feel like I'm just proving there points when I do. This isn't the first time I've been kicked out of something so I'm thinking maybe its a problem with me? Am I the asshole for being upset when asking them questions and trying to understand?

Edit: Due to people asking more questions I'll elaborate. I was kicked out of an rp server due to self projecting on a character to much. When I said I'll use a different character and work on that in my own time they didn't agree. They said i get to attached and I cant distinguish rp from reality when I know its not true. I was visibaly very angry in these posts and I had the occational sarcasim in there and I think that might have been to much. Maybe if I were more civilised about it I would be able to see what they see? These were people who I thought were my friends. The more I disagreed and didn't understand the more they insisted that I was the asshole for doing so and I shouldn't be so mad over this. I'm not sure if this answers your questions, but I hope it elaborates some things."	Asshole	0	0

However, she has rented a few rooms in our house for the last 5 years and while living with us I've always been super generous with Christmas and her birthday.  

&#x200B;

My birthday was a few months ago.  She asked me what I wanted, and I gave her a few ideas.  But that was it.  She didn't get me anything.  I don't really care.  I'm in a place where if I need or want something I can buy it myself.

&#x200B;

So last night she sends me a text with a t-shirt pic and the caption ""birthday present ideas""  I responded by asking her what she got me for my birthday this year.  She said she got my hubby a cake (which I asked her to pick up).  Then she sent a text saying ""I don't remember...""  

Her birthday is in a few days.  And honestly I was not planning on getting her anything more than a cake for after dinner (I cook dinner for all of us 5-6 nights a week).  I just assumed this was a low key year and gifts weren't required.  

&#x200B;

So would I be the asshole if I just blew if off?

PS Before you say anything about us texting while in the same house.  We live in separate areas and I was putting my daughter to bed and going to bed shortly thereafter.  We live in the same house but we don't cohabit more than dinner and hanging out occasionally.   Like if she lived in her own place."	Asshole	0	0
c2kfn2	2019-06-19 18:06:37		AITA for telling my girlfriend to do whatever makes her happy?	"This is a gay relationship, FYI. 

We both graduated college recently and my girlfriend (“Nicole”) is trying to figure out what to do with her life. We’ve been together for a year and really love each other but I guess we express that differently. 

My girlfriend is willing to make a lot of sacrifices for me. If I say the word she’d pretty much drop whatever I asked her to. But this isn’t something I want, and whenever she considers a job that wouldn’t work for us I tell her that she should do it if that’s what she really wants. I try to downplay how I’d feel about it because I feel like I have such a big hold on her decisions and don’t want to end up making them for her. 

She brought up to me that she doesn’t like this because it makes her feel like I’m not committed to us. She says that whenever I tell her to do what makes her happy she just hates that I see us breaking up as a possible option to take. She says she wishes I’d straight up say that if she picks a certain field then we’re over because she wants to be able to prioritize us. But I don’t feel comfortable telling her what to do with her life. 

I tried explaining it by telling her that it’s because I love her that I prioritize her over our relationship, and that I hate the idea of breaking up too. I just want the best for her even if it doesn’t necessarily include me. But she said that if it was really that important to her she’d dump me and go for it.

This happened about an hour and a half ago.

I live in a gated neighborhood, and I was at the front of the line, putting in the code after coming home from school while this metallic gray Mercades was waiting behind me. While I was putting in the code, because the road in is wide enough, the Mercades decided to pull ahead of me and wait at the gate.  This would have been normally fine with me (and some residents have a special tag that will open the gate for them automatically, but this person didn't have one. I know because the gate weeks have opened before I put in the code of they did.), but I've hardly had anything to eat this morning, and only got 4 hours of sleep last night, so I was already in an aggressive, No Bullshit mood. So after I put in the code, because I was first in line and being petty, I went up and practically kissed the gate with my bumper so I could take my rightful spot as first in line, and squeezed by once the gate was open wide enough. I feel like a dick after thinking about it, but I thought I'd come here to get a third opinion. Am I the asshole?

c2kf4z	2019-06-19 18:05:27	twinninginlife	AITA with expecting my husband to put forth more effort help?	My husband got a new job 6 months ago. It’s a good job,  pretty good pay for our area and he is happy with it. When he got the job we knew he would be traveling for at least four months, 20 days away from home and then 8 days off. He has always been really good about contributing to the household chores and caring for our kids. If anything he’s done a bit more housework than me while I do a little more of the childcare. We’ve always had a pretty even keel marriage with few low points. Lately it’s been tough. Not only the distance but also with husbands communication efforts and initiative to help with what he can while he is away and at home. He left yesterday for another 20 days- I had made a list of tasks (that he requested) that I need his help with and he didn’t complete all of them. So now I’m stuck doing even more work than what I have already with my full time job and three kids (one being a toddler and another being an infant). I’m getting burned out and feeling resentful. Am I the asshole? Am I expecting too much of him? I don’t feel like I am, I feel like he’s got it pretty good considering he can work without having to worry about a sick kid or having to get up in the middle of the night with our infant. I know the distance is difficult for him (it’s difficult for everyone- and I know what it’s like being away for a couple weeks from the kids due to a job) but I’m feeling like I’m pulling way more than my weight while he has continued to slack off. I keep track of our budget and have to ask him every couple days to update me on his spending. I have to keep lists for what needs to be done around the house that I’m not capable of doing or need help doing. I feel like the amount of emotional labor I am currently carrying is way more than it should be. AITA?	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2kf2m	2019-06-19 18:05:18		AITA for telling my husband to stop embarrassing me	"So long story short on the backstory part, I was flashed by some guy who was supposed to be washing buildings in our apartment complex today. I told our property manager (PM) who went to handle it immediately. We don’t have a good relationship with her so when I got home and told my husband (5 seconds after I told PM)  he thought it was a good idea to stay out on our balcony and watch her talk to the building washer guys. 
I did not agree, and told him so before he went out. I think that will only make PM dislike us more, that it looks trashy and it’s embarrassing for me to have my husband staring down people we don’t like very publicly.

c2keem	2019-06-19 18:03:55	doglovermomta	AITA for wanting to keep my dog?	"This might seem like a validation post at first but hear me out. 

When I graduated college I got a dog. He was my best bud and we did everything together and he’s a really good dog. 

A few years after I got my dog I met my husband. He does not like dogs but throughout our relationship we’ve found compromises. The dog is disappointed he’s no longer allowed on the bed but he adjusted. 

Baby #1 came. I was working full time and I’d come home and my dog would want my attention but obviously so did my son, and it started causing my dog anxiety. He didn’t like competing for attention or the loud, busy nature of a baby. He’s always been very patient with kids, he doesn’t snap, bite, or growl, but he does get annoyed and sometimes jealous. 

When I got pregnant with Baby #2 we knew we were in trouble. With my husband not really willing to give the dog much attention and me getting too overwhelmed with work, toddler, and pregnancy, the dog was neglected and had some serious separation anxiety. 

My sister, who is a dog lover and who has always known my dog offered to take my dog for a while. She said she would keep him until we got adjusted to the new baby and I could have him back whenever I wanted. 

Shortly after having Baby #2, I decided to become a stay at home mom. When my sister went on vacation recently, I took my dog back as a “trial run” to see how he would do. He’s been back about 2.5 weeks and things are going really well. Now that I am home all day, it’s easier for me to give my dog plenty of attention. He is still driven a little crazy by my toddler’s antics, but he doesn’t seem miserable and he doesn’t have the anxiety he had before. 

My sister is back from vacation and dropped this bomb: if I want her to take my dog again she will, but only if she can keep him. She doesn’t think it’s good for the dog to go back and forth. 

I know my dog was really happy with my sister and perhaps he would be happiest there. But I missed having him be part of the family. And although the young kids are not his cup of tea, I don’t think he’s miserable here. I hate the idea of not being able to have him back. My husband is no help because if it were up to him, we wouldn’t have the dog at all, although he wouldn’t stop me from decided to keep him. 

My sister has made some other comments that make me suspect she thinks this is a terrible home for my dog and she needs to “rescue” him from us. She’s such a dog lover, not allowing the dog on the couch is practically abuse in her mind.

It’s worth mentioning my sister lives about 3 hours away so if my dog is with her I can have occasional visits but not all the time. 

So given that apparently my options are to keep my dog or give him back to my sister permanently, am I the asshole for wanting to keep him?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c2kedj	2019-06-19 18:03:51		WIBTA for having a secret wedding with no one other than my so and myself.	"So I've been having issues with my wedding since the beginning from finding out someone I hate and we both have history with is expected to give birth that day and some family will be there not at our wedding, to family members saying we aren't close we hate you we aren't coming, to less than half our small rsvps being a yes, to having siblings telling us to fuck off they won't come, to parents forget to even send in the rsvp.

The whole thing has turned into a huge mess and it's getting so stressful I can't deal. My so and I are planning to hold a secret ceremony just himself and me in a few weeks and not telling anyone. We will still go through the ""real"" wedding for everyone that's rsvped however.

Parents on both sides stated they would hunt us down and kill us (not very jokingly) if we eloped. Whole reason we ended up doing a wedding. Well now we want to go back to our original plan. Problem is if these people ever found out they would be pissed and probably not talk to us again as they are paying for most of the wedding.

However it has slowly continued to get out of hand and become something neither of us are looking forward to. Would I/we be the assholes for doing this? Even though I want to do it I keep feeling guilty over it."		1	0

I'm part of a global group for POC. It's supposed to be a safe spot where we can talk about anything. I myself am a black (non-American) woman.

The topic of ""Juneteenth"" came up when an admin posted a picture related to it.

I have a vague idea of what it is, but I was not sure, so I simply asked what it was.

They told me to Google it.

Now, all I wanted was to have a live discussion with someone who celebrates it to know what it's really about.

I specified that.

Then several people got in on me saying that they were not going to do the work for me, they were tired of ""having to do the work for other people"", calling me lazy, disingenious, etc.

c2kcs3	2019-06-19 18:00:36	edgar__allan__bro	WIBTA for invoicing my ex for half of my dog's vet bills?	"My ex wife got a puppy in college. He effectively became mine when I got her pregnant and we moved in together.

After our son was born, she got sick of having to care for a dog on top of a baby (even though I was really the only one making sure he was being cared for) and after a year of dealing with both, the pup was subsequently shipped around from relative to relative for a few months at a time before he was finally relegated to her parents' barn. When we split up two years ago, she moved into a place where she could have the dog without paying any pet fees, so she took him back in.

Last year, I had a lengthy conversation with the guy that she started dating after we split up, and he let me know that my ex had gotten a new puppy, and her (my) dog was being kept in a pitch black basement at just about all hours of the day, other than occasionally being let outside to do his business. So, I contacted my ex, and I arranged to take the dog with me because... well, I felt bad that he was being neglected in favor of a new puppy. She told me that he'd just had all of his shots updated so I didn't need to worry about that, and off we went...

Fast forward to recent months, we finally have our divorce agreement in place, and things have cooled off. I'm holding up my end of the bargain in paying support and 50% of my son's medical and dental expenses. However, on top of that, I've now got what used to be her dog, who as it turns out was *not* up to date on all of his shots, so I had to fork over $189 in the initial appointment, and now have subsequent appointments set up where boosters will be required ($25 per). In addition, the vet identified a tumor in my dog's chest, and said that though it may just be a lipoma, a draw of fluid from the mass indicated that it's worth sending to a lab to be tested (a one-off cost of $186). Assuming the worst, there could be a fuck ton of vet bills down the road if he has cancer.

Frankly, I haven't been in a great financial position since we split up, and that's causing strain on the relationship that I'm currently in, especially since the idea of, ""What if this dog has cancer -- we can't afford that"" has sunk in. But considering what I'm paying to my ex to support our son and the fact that the dog was ours together at one point (and our son still remembers him/asks about him all the time/still considers him one of his pets), I feel like it wouldn't be completely unreasonable to ask her to cover 50% of the dog's medical expenses.

**TL;DR: Ex got a puppy in college, we had a baby, dog was shipped around a lot/hardly had a permanent home until I found out she was keeping him locked in her basement, and he's mine now. I pay child support plus 50% of medical/dental bills, but also 100% of the vet bills for this dog.**

Ultimately I don't expect her to agree to it, but I'm just wondering, WIBTA for making that request? Or is this a perfectly reasonable line of thought?"	Asshole	0	0

At work, we have a cafeteria. On Wednesday’s they sell nachos. It’s like $5.50 for a container of chips, nacho cheese, beef or chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese, salsa and sour cream.

A few weeks ago I got some and the chips got disgusting because the cheese sauce made them super soggy. I’m This week, I asked the lady serving them if she could put the cheese in a separate container so my chips didn’t get gross. She did, and I went up to pay.

The lady at the register wanted to charge me $5.50 for my nachos plus $1.50 for a side item. I showed her what it was and explained why I wanted it separated. She said that if the cheese was on the chips it would be included, but not on the side. I offered to pay for the plastic container (they charge like .15 for an empty container), and she wouldn’t take it.

I initially said I thought that was pretty ridiculous and didn’t want to purchase them, but she informed me that the food would be trashed and I felt bad. So I ended up paying $7.00 for some shitty nachos and spite eating them.

Was I the asshole to be pissed about the extra charge? I was fairly polite, just told her that I thought the rule was ridiculous and didn’t make sense. I realize that she is an employee and doesn’t set rules so I didn’t take anything out on her, I just wasn’t sure if I was actually in the wrong."	No A-holes here	0	0

I felt really bad for the delivery guy because he has no protection other than a helmet, the taxi driver could have had him killed. And I’m very aware sometimes people get in your blind spot but I just felt the taxi driver was being sort of wreckless with he constant zipping between lanes.

My wife and I got married during college because we had a kid together. We had already been together for years so it was an “easy” adjustment. Now a couple years out of school and she got pregnant again, unplanned again. We are getting close to paying off old debts and tbh I was unsure I wanted another kid anyway. Abortion wasn’t an option because my wife believes life begins at conception, and I don’t. (I should mention we are both pro-choice, it’s just we disagree on that tidbit). And since I’m pro-choice and love my wife I *didn’t* pressure her to have an abortion. 


We just found out it miscarried and I’m not too sad about the loss of the fetus. I am heartbroken that my wife is suffering. My heart hasn’t stopped pounding over her pain, idk if that’s anger or what but it’s there and it hurts.

c2k75k	2019-06-19 17:48:12	SeattleAnon18	AITA for asking someone to not watch porn on public transit?	"Happened yesterday and I had trouble gauging if I was TA or not.

I sat down on the train next to this guy who was watching porn on his phone. I dont think he realized how obvious it was until I sat next to him so he put his backpack onto his lap and kept watching porn. I was not trying to look at his phone, It was extremely hard not to notice.

I turn to the guy and ask if he can do that later in private. The guy gets flustered and asks what I was talking about so I tell him that I can clearly see he’s watching porn. He yells at me saying that it’s not porn and I should mind my own business. By now, the train was packed and his yelling got the attention of those around us, so I got up and left to the next car section.

The guy got up a few minutes from the original train section and followed me to where I moved to and started yelling at me extremely loudly, screaming that I took his photo and asked what my fucking problem was. EVERYONE in the old and new train sections were staring at us so I responded by saying “I didn’t take a picture of you, I asked you to stop looking at porn. Then I moved to this section and you followed me” loudly enough for everyone to hear. 

Immediately, he gets right up in my face, yelling and spitting that he was just texting his friend and she was sending him videos as a joke (he was on pornhub from what I could see). He starts raising his hands to my face, telling me that he’s going to make me get off at the next stop, threatening me etc. 

By now, two women and two men from the train stood between me and him. They were telling him to calm down and back off from me (I’m guessing because I’m only 19 yearsold and he was a middle aged man). The guy starts yelling how I took his photo and how he put his backback up so no one could see his phone so I was the one getting into his business.

I did not take his photo and I stood away from him in the second train he followed me into. We both were calm and separated until he started yelling around the train again that he was not watching porn and that I should mind my own business. I decide to call him out on it and tell him if he wasnt watching porn then he should have no issues showing everyone that it wasnt porn. He gets flustered again and starts coming towards me until people on the train stop him from reaching me. 

At the end someone on the train contacted emergency services to meet me at my stop. Before arriving at my stop, one lady on the train asked me that next time I should have just kept to myself. 

I’m sort of floored because I asked him politely to stop watching porn, then moved away when he refused, then he chased me down with false accusations of taking his photo.

So me and my friend, DJ, were gaming/talking over discord about Always Be My Maybe and Crazy Rich Asians. I told him I only saw ABMM because of Keanu. He told me he saw it because he was asian, he had no idea Keanu was in it and was blown away by the cameo. I think this is an important part of the conversation my wife missed.

So my wife gets on and we change subject a bit. 

Then I ask DJ is it racist to ask someone if they identify with a movie because their race?

DJ: Yea...

Me: Oh, ... Did any of the family member stereotypes from CRA remind you of your family members?

DJ: lol no, cuz I'm not rich

Wife: Wtf is your problem. I can't believe you just did that. You asked if it was racist then did it anyways

Me: I know, it's just the movies obviously trying to emulate typical aunts and uncles and I wanted to see how close it was

Wife: You're being super racist right now. Hes not going to relate to a movie just because it's about people of his race. You're stereotyping him

Me: Did you relate to Coco?

Hispanic wife: That's not the same thing, I grew up in a similar situation

Me: So what? I'm being classist then? Not racist?

Wife: No, you're racist. He's not even the same kind of asain, he's Philipino!

(100% me being annoyed and pushing her buttons now) Hey DJ, do u identify with Pearl harbor?

We both bust up laughing.

Now I'm just laughing tbh. She gets mad and signs off discord and tears off her headset.

Wife: I know you like to joke but I think you're an actual racist.

Wife: I don't care, I'm not comfortable with hanging out in an environment where it's ok to joke like that. He's not even Japanese.

Me: Im sorry about the Pearl Harbor joke, I was just emulating what you were basically implying I was. Kinda, you think that was racist? This is racist, kinda joke.

Wife: it was shitty

Eventually I ask, is this really the mountain you want to die on? No one's offended but you. Let's just relax a bit, it's the weekend.

Wife: Only if you promise not to be racist

Me (this annoyed me): Look I'm trying to make it easy for us to get back to our weekend. You're still trying to start something.

"Okay so all of the eggs my bonded pair of parrots laid hatched and are healthy and active and make the right amount of sound. I was expecting maybe one wpuld actually hatch bc the first clutch tends to have a weakness in some way bc first time parents can have issues. But they are doing great.[one is slowly becoming the cutest little creature and i must resist keeping all of them but s(he) is so sweet.] My plan was originally to pull them from the jest before their eyes even opened and take over but shit went wrong elsewhere in my life so I had none of the stuff I intended to have and so we had to leave them there extra time. Now if i do pull them they're coming out of their nest this weekend. My mother has said she thinks its mean to do that and it will upset the parents. The parents allow me to handle the babies no problem. So I'm kinda torn. I know for an almost fact I'm not keeping the babies and that they *will* be going to another home most likely. And that being tame is the selling point for them bc a lot of people wouldn't buy a bird that has never been handled.(unless they like that bird and decide they can spare a year of their life...i regret nothing she is perfect...now, anyway.) But also I was looking forward to handfeeding. Half the point of breeding was to get to handfeed without personally agreeing to a 30+ year commitment.  It's something i enjoy. They'll be tame as hell either way bc I handle them several times a day. I have them in a setup where I can easily remove the nest/nursery and replace it without pissing anyone off. The parents watch me but were just fine when i took one baby out of the house yesterday.[he had to go see someone about what looked like a leg problem but turned out to just be him being a little baby and learning how to position his feet.] 

So aita if i do pull them? Im (probably) not keeping them and the parents are tame enough to handle and are good parents. 
I don't know. There is one baby in there that im very tempted to keep like...at least im not irreversibly attached to *all* of them. That one however may just have to stay."	Not enough info	0	0
c2k41e	2019-06-19 17:41:29	angeldrinks	AITA for complaining to my boss after he denied me a promotion?	"So long story short, my boss had to promote one person on our team to be assistent supervisor for days that the boss is absent. The choice was between me and one of my newer coworkers. The job eventually went to the other person. Of course, I really wanted this promotion, but I totally understand why they went for the other person and they are doing a good job.

Shortly after the announcement of the new assistent supervisor, I was left alone with two entirely new coworkers for a whole day and I was expected to show them everything and teach them how to do their jobs. No supervisors, just me being the only experienced employee for the whole day with two new guys. After our shift ended, the two supervisors (meaning my boss and the assistent supervisor) both showed up for an extra shift to film a promotion video. This annoyed me. A lot.

So I went and told my boss that now that there is an assistant supervisor, I did not feel comfortable being at work for the whole day with two new guys. Especially since both supervisors were available that evening. In my opion, one of them should have taken the day shift to supervise and help the new guys get set up, and not me. I feel like it's their job as supervisors to do so. I also told him that for this one time it was fine, but I don't want something like that to happen again.

Now, my boss said to the assistent supervisor that he thinks I'm being difficult about this, and he thinks it's due to me not getting that promotion. So am I being an asshole about this?

Edit: Just want to say thanks to everyone who replied. You guys really got me thinking, and I probably won't be working there much longer."	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

Additions are expensive and always cost more then you expect or plan for.

If you already know this house will need work to make it into the house you want then maybe this is not the right house.

Also houses are expensive and she admitted her job is not that stable.

c2jyal	2019-06-19 17:29:07	CasaDePANDA	AITA for asking my wife to pay for half of the car repairs?	"It's my wife's decision that we maintain seperate finances. I drive more than she does because I have a much longer commute. We don't consistantly drive the same cars, we often switch. We have three used cars that I purchased and paid cash for. We have an 06 Corolla, an 02 CRV, and an 04 Pilot. The CRV is off the road at the moment because it needs some work to pass inspection. I can do all the work myself at home, but its tiresome and chews up all my free time. She has a decent job now, making about 30k salary, so she can afford a few things. I make about 50k salary.  I'm a backyard mechanic, but not by choice, only because I was broke in college, and had to do what i had to do.

All the car repairs are normal stuff, like brakes, exhaust, oil, tires, sensors, and such. Some of these things i've fixed already, and others are on the to-do list. Im my estimate in the last 6 months, ive spent about $600 on these repairs, and there is still another $400 left of repairs to do. We aren't currently budgeting for these this because car repairs arn't considered predictable monthly bills by my wife, and this leaves me with some anxiety.

Would easily cost waaay more if taken to the shop. I typically spend every sunday working on cars. I don't like the idea of my wife getting a car payment, because it's not the Dave Ramsey way. She would give me the money though... if i asked her, she would give it to me. It shouldn't matter who pays, but because we have seperate finances, it make this difficult.

c2jxd4	2019-06-19 17:27:12		AITA for not wanting to share my stuff with my family?	"I got a cute pink tumbler from my aunt last week, it was very exciting to me because I don't really get gifts and I've been wanting a tumbler for some time now. My grandmother told me to put it in the cupboard so other people won't use it, and I thought it was a good idea so I put it there and only used it sometimes. A few days ago, my stepfather brought his son to my home and gave the cup for him to use, which made me a bit uncomfortable. He washed it later but, still, I don't appreciate sharing my cup with other people.

&#x200B;

The other incident happened yesterday. My grandmother gave me a really cute t-shirt (again, exciting because getting clothes it somewhat rare to me) and it was in my wardrobe, neatly folded and washed, together with all my shirts; I was going to used it yesterday and when I was looking for it, turns out it wasn't there anymore and I asked if my grandmother knew where it was, if she didn't accidentally put it in her wardrobe - she said no, and we actually looked for it together. My mother has a weird habit of lending our clothes to her boyfriend (my stepfather) without asking us first, so sometimes I see mine and my grandmas clothes in her boyfriend's bag (because he sleeps here sometimes, so he brings a bag with clothes). Our clothes are kinda unisex so it ""kinda"" fits him, but still, I hate this. 

&#x200B;

I saw one of my grandmas jackets in my stepfather's bad the day before yesterday and I thought it was weird, and today I looked at her wardrobe and it still wasn't there. We asked my mom if she lended our clothes to him, and she denied and said that she didn't know where our clothes are. Even so, I already searched the entire house for this specific t-shirt and I didn't found it - I haven't used it recently so it wasn't being washed, so the only possible answer is that my mom lied and she actually lended the shirt.

&#x200B;

She kinda yelled at me for being petty and not wanting to share my things, but my grandma said that I shouldn't share if I don't want to - and I agree with her, but at the same time I feel like I'm just being petty and my mom is being an asshole.

c2jwow	2019-06-19 17:25:44	squidster42	AITA for disowning my brother for stealing from me?	"Last year my younger brother (20) stole 3k in cash from me as well as lots of random trinkets and priceless belongings. I caught him red handed and confronted him, which he denied for a while until finally admitting to (some) of it. 

Note that earlier in the year i lent him $400 which he never repaid. I got him 3 jobs (on my good word) all of which he lost. Then he crashed his car, parents bought him a nice new civic and he crashed that. When he crashed the civic I went to the accident, took the weed out of his car so he didn’t get a DWI and cleaned the broken glass off our neighbors driveway for them. 

Instead of berating after catching him stealing I calmly explained how everyone makes mistakes and this doesn’t define him, gave him an opportunity to help me move furniture and do some work I needed a hand with and took the opportunity to talk about life with him. I gave him the chance to confess to our dad on his own instead of having me tell him, which he thanked me for (of course I still gave my dad a heads up). 

Side not, when I told my dad that he stole from me and that I highly suspect he may have a drug problem, probably Xanax, my dad responded by telling me he doesn’t even leave his wallet out anymore because money keeps going missing. He broke down crying and told me he would move out from his wife and son and get a place with me if I needed help (I didn’t need that but the gesture showed me just how cornered he was feeling).

My brother needed to get our step mom a birthday gift the same day I confronted him and my dumb ass lent him $30 to buy her a gift which he assured he would repay me. Of course he didn’t.

Fast forward a few days... Instead of confessing to our dad he twisted the story to my step mom instead and completely omitted his worst offenses. 

I snapped when she confronted me and made it very clear that he is a lying manipulative brat that I highly suspect of being a drug addict. 

Next time I saw him I blew up and told him he was dead to me. It’s been nearly a year since that and the only thing I’ve said to him was “happy birthday stay safe” in a text to which I got no reply, I haven’t talked to my stepmom once and I talked to my dad only half a dozen times. My dad wants me to call him and work things out but I can’t wrap my head around how to even begin that conversation. I strongly feel that he is an adult and he needs to be the one to begin repairing this broken relationship.

TLDR: my younger brother stole a ton of money from me after I lent him money, helped him avoid a DWI and he lost a few jobs that I got for him with my good word.

Blew up on my family after shit hit the fan and he lied about it, told him he’s dead to me and I refuse to initiate a conversation to repair the relationship."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2jwfy	2019-06-19 17:25:13	saysnoeverytime	AITA for stabbing my carpenter in the back?	"About 2,5 months ago I finally managed go get my insurance company to agree on reestablishing the entry of our house after some water damage. The craftsmen that I had gotten quotes from were all too expensive for the insurance company to accept. The reason was that in order to do a proper job of it, you would have to do quite a bit more than what the appraisers estimated.

A responsible contractor (let's call him Bob) was finally appointed by the insurance company in order for them to accept what should be done. He was also the one in charge of the appraisal. He was a friendly and efficient man who very quickly established a plan for the work to be done. We would not get our wishes wrt. reestablishment fulfilled, though.

A carpenter (let's call him Jim) quickly showed up to begin tearing down damaged stuff - he was sent by Bob. He agreed to do a lot of the things that the insurance company did not want to pay for - free of extra charge. A quite extraordinary help for us. We provided some materials and some cabinets for him to install and he would then do the rest. In reality it didn't cost him that much extra time, but it had the promise of making the finished product much more complete. I promised not to tell Bob about the extra effort.

After the first time, he he had been there, everything looked great. But our next appointment which was at 7am was postponed. He wrote me a text at 6am that he would not come. This happened again and again and again (4 times in total) and he ""forgot"" yet another appointment. Two and a half months passed. When he finally showed up, the job done was quite frankly terrible. Crooked lines, wrong measurements, gaping holes etc etc. Our washing machine could not be connected and would not fit where it was supposed to go.

Jim did not answer my messages or calls. I was asking him what to do about all these issues. But no reply.

My girlfriend is due to give birth in a couple of weeks - we can not wait to get it fixed any longer. I seriously doubted that Jim would get it done within a couple of months. So today I called Bob to get him to take a look at it. He will come here next week. And he will see the extra things that Jim has kindly done for us. I wrote Jim a text saying that I had informed Bob. Almost immediately, I got a call from Jim saying that I was getting him in a lot of trouble with Bob - his boss. That I stabbed him in the back.

I’ve never grown up with locking the door, having passwords, securing my personal info, nothing. He is the type that rips any bill apart so that the numbers end up on different papers and then throw the paper bits in different garbage disposals so no one get any personal information about him.  He has Facebook (he has to because of some school stuff) but refuses to download messenger on this phone.

I have tried to understand him and accept it. Started to lock the door to our apartment and stuff like that, but we are still very different and I’m struggling not to think that he is hugely paranoid (not for the door thing but the ripping up every paper and stuff like that) . 
He is currently traveling with some friends, and I will be traveling for work the next week and I really miss him, but he refuses to have messenger on his phone. It’s expensive to text and call, so it would be really nice to use messenger. I have not found any other app that allows us to call without having it on speaker for some weird reason. We are three weeks apart and it would be really really nice to talk to him without being on speaker all the time. So I’m a bit annoyed when he just doesn’t want to download it.

Story:  
Last year wife and I got a house (moved in May 2018), we decided to host Christmas (December 2018) for my family and invite both parents and sister since it was a good neutral place for all. Christmas went well and by this time, our plans to go to Europe were all setup and ready to go. We just needed to find someone to house-and-cat sit. My wife and I decided to give my sister a chance and asked if she would be interested in staying at our place while we are out of the country. Since we knew she wanted to move out of her Ex's place (but did have the means) we figured this would give her a nice break and our house was significantly closer to her work (10 minutes away compared to 45 minutes) so she could also save money.  
  
We asked her in December if she would be willing to do the following things for us while we were gone:  
\- Live at our place in the guest room (there is a TV, bed, towels, full bath, empty dresser for her in the house, and lots of PC/VR games)  
\- Feed the cats twice per day and clean their litter box  
\- Give the 3 cats lots of attention and love  
In return we would give her:  
\- $120 for whatever  
\- A fully stocked fridge and pantry for 9 days of whatever she wanted  
\- A gift card or two to a restaurant/fast food place nearby she may want  
  
She said she would love to but needed to think about it. Next month she says sure but will need extra gas money so asks for $220 instead of $120. We said okay anyways since we wanted to give her a chance. 2 months before our trip, my sister tells us that she will not be staying at our place but will be driving back and forth. We told her okay again. Now 1 month before our trip we learn from a family friend that my sister recently got a ticket for an expired registration 2 months ago and has still not fixed it. This means next time she gets pulled over, she will have her car taken away and possibly go to jail. Which would mean that our cats would not have anyone to care for them and we would have no way of knowing what is going on. Also because of her current situation, there is no way for her to reliably get a ride between her Ex's place, our house, and her work. This was the final nail in the coffin and a month before our trip, we messaged her that we will not need her to watch the cats or house sit.  
  
Immediately after telling her this, her Ex texts me telling us we are being total assholes to her and that she was relying on this money from us and now has fallen more into depression.  
  
TLDR: Asked sister to stay at house while on vacation to feed/care for cats. She asks for more than we offered and 1 month before trip, we figure out she cannot legally drive so we cancel the offer to her and her Ex texts me saying we are being shitty. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2jsnl	2019-06-19 17:16:54		AITA For not viewing my half sister as a sister?	"I grew up an only child, or so at least I thought I was, as it turns out my father had a previous marriage, and I have a half sister. She's about 20 years older than I am, and lives in another state. For a long time this hasnt been an issue, but as her and my father continue to reconnect, she's become more and more curious about me. She might even refer to me as her brother. 

I don't have any problem with this, she can get to know me, or call her whatever she wants. However I don't have the same feelings. I don't think of her as a sister, we didn't grow up together, and have never even seen each other in person. I don't view her as a sister, and probably never will. We never had that bond that siblings have. Even today I say I'm an only child. 

My father has asked me about it, and I told him the truth, he seems ok with it, and understands. However I can't help but feel that deep down he might be disappointed. I've never told her, we haven't spoken much at all, neither one of us have really put in that effort, but I would respond if she asked anything.

c2jrh3	2019-06-19 17:14:09	NebulaChowdhur	AITA for telling my sister to get her life together?	"Before I address the problem, some context is required. I have three siblings, two older sisters (one in college and one is hs) , and one younger brother. My oldest sister is basically the perfect child, good grades, doesn't speak back too much, and is doing really well right now. She just got an internship at NASA too. Perfect child. And then there is my other sister. 

With such a perfect first child, they expected their second one too be as well. Well... That didn't happen. She was okay at first, but when she got into middle school she started to not turn in assignments in school, not do her homework, and spend all her time on electronics. She started failing classes. It got a lot worse when she got her first phone. She would talk to her friends constantly, and wouldn't eat with us anymore. She was basically a big let down. 

Than there's me, who's expectations grew double to make up for my older sister. This led me to essentially grow up a lot faster, and I'm very mature for my age. More mature than my older sister. (I'm not necessarily mad about it, but I do get stressed because of it.)

Okay, let's get down to the big issue.

Next school year, my sister is going to be a senior in high school. And because I love her to death, I'm worried on how she's gonna do. I want her to at least make the last year count, so I had a conversation with her about it. (The rest of my family tried). I told her that she had to stop acting like everything is gonna work out in the future when you put in no effort whatsoever. She knows I'm right, so in the end she tells me to stfu. When I talk to her about her behavior towards my parents(which isn't too good) sometimes she blames it on her mental health(she has anxiety and depression I believe). So I told her this.

""Even with your mental problems, it's no excuse to act the way you are. It is your responsibility to maintain your relationships with others. No one elses. They already have a lot on their plate, and they shouldn't have to balance you problems on it as well. Get you shit together""

I feel like I'm right, but I also feel like a total bitch. She's older than me, and has her problems and I probably contribute to her depression. But I've always been a blunt and straightforward person, so I have it to her as it is. Don't get me wrong, ive tried to be nice about it. But I've just had enough at the time. 

So give it too me straight, AITA?

Edit: want to clarify that she is getting therapy for her mental health, and has been for about two years. She has a on and off relationship with my parents. They have heated arguments, but the next day it's like it never happened. I hate the fact that in my family the problem is never truly addressed.

Edit: This has been going on ever since she started high school. I definitely try to encourage her but it's been so long that even I'm a bit tired of it. But it has been slowly getting better. She used to have extremely high standards with no effort to back it up( getting into a really good college with a rlly low gpa) but now she has more realistic goals that my whole family backs her up on (going to community college than transferring to the really good college).

&#x200B;

Pretty much my friend was a piece of shit and we stopped talking. 

While we WERE friends, we would always hang out. Only thing about that is, he would NEVER bring money and only would hang when I or my friend had money or something to offer (food, games, etc).

On multiple occasions he would say stuff like ""Don't worry guys I'll pay next time"" or ""When I get my paycheck I'll buy you guys stuff, what do you want me to buy you?"" (even though WHEN he got his paycheck he always said he was broke).

After we had our fall out I asked him to give me the money (VERY much less than what I actually spent over the years) which was $50. ALL I asked for was 50 (despite literally one time we hung out I dropped 50, so you can see that I definitely was generous), which he raised too 100. I said sure and to give it to me when he get paid next. He said sure and that was in February. He got paid a week later and never came to give me the money, hasn't contacted me and occasionally still shit talks me in the group chat he and his friends have. When I asked my friend to ask him (as the ex friend blocked me on all social medias when I tried to contact him) he said he wasn't going to pay me back because ""you didn't have to do that, you were just being nice"".

She's nice enough but when she gets like this, the rest of us roll our eyes.

Well we're working yesterday and she barges in my office telling me she thinks she is deathly ill. She's hysterical and all this. So I ask her if she'd like me to call an ambulance she declines but asks I take her to the hospital. Well I concede. If only because our policy states that it's my responsibility. So I take her and lo and behold: Nothing but an allergy. They tell her to take allergy medication. They say the rest was all in her head essentially which doesn't surprise me.

Well today I come in and looking at when we left she missed 6 hours of an 8 hour day. Now we're all salary so if you miss more than half a day, you get docked for the day. So I marked her as out. I could give her the day as a sick day if she had a doctor's note but the doctor wasn't going to give her a note for this.

Well she finds out and is mad that she was docked the day. I explain that if she can produce a doctor's note I'll give her the day. Hell I know clinics will even write a BS note if you pay them enough but she's pulling this woe less me crap and is turning the other staff against me.

Not like I'm overly doubting myself, but some insight may help. AITA?

**UPDATE:** The People have spoken! Based on your feedback I've talked with HR and Payroll and we're going to give her the day but we're also going to be letting her know that in the future she won't be receiving the day as a sick day unless she presents us with the sick note.

So, recently, I (17M) was at my grandparents’ home and I was staying a couple nights there, and I got some texts while I was in the living room so I decided to respond to them. Phone was making no noise and others around me were on devices as well. My grandma freaked out told me to take the device into another room and use or put it away, or she’ll take it for the rest of the day. My aunt immediately interjected and said I was doing no harm, and told my grandma that I’m almost a grown man, and that taking something like a phone from someone who’s almost a grown man is not a way to get them to behave. I pointed out that I saw several laptops and iPhones being used by others at the same time, and got told I was being disrespectful by calling out the behavior of adults to justify my own.

"Normally I would think cut and dry I wouldn't be the asshole, but it's a little more complicated.  A week ago I(26F) got hit by a kid riding his bike on the sidewalk, he looked about 12.  I was pretty shocked, there are bike lanes because I live in a city.  At the time I couldn't think straight so I told him to go on his way if he was ok.  Then I took an uber to the hospital and am now in a sling with a broken elbow.

At first I wasn't too pissed.  I recognized the kid from my neighborhood and his mom has always been nice to me when we walk by each other.

Then I lost a couple hourly gigs I had as a researcher (I'm a student on summer break), because I'm working too slow typing with my left hand only.

Yesterday I saw the same kid racing his brother on the sidewalk.  The street I directly live on is kind of busy with a bike lane, but the streets behind me are very suburban and lots of kids ride in the streets because cars rarely go by.

I was livid he didn't learn his lesson.  I want to find out which house theyre from an tell the mom what happened and that hes still on the sidewalk.

My dad thinks that appropriate because the kid didnt learn his lesson.  My mom and husband think I'm just stirring up trouble because I have no intention of suing, so I'm just creating drama.  Should I just let it go?  

  

Edit: Thanks for all your input! I've decided I'll tell the mom tomorrow so I don't interrupt their dinner etc.  I'm just going to explain what happened and raise the concern that he or someone else could get hurt because he's continuing to do this.  I'll update her response because I know I always enjoy an update.  
  
Update:  I knocked on their door today while they were home.  The mom looked right at me then walked away without opening the door. Not sure what she thought was happening but I'm taking it as a sign to let it go.  Her problem now."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2jjz3	2019-06-19 16:57:45	Zyonem_po	AITA for leaving my sister's birthday party in the middle as she was rude to my girlfriend?	"*This is my alt account.*

&#x200B;

OK so all this drama dates back to my girlfriend's (24F) last birthday which was two months ago. 

&#x200B;

So during my girlfriend's birthday I decided to gift her a new high specs laptop, as she was going to pursue her master's degree. Her old laptop was worn out from years of use. As I was already starting to make more from my job, so I did not see the problem in giving her this ""expensive"" gift. She was overjoyed from her birthday gift and loved it. Now in our 4.5 years of relationship I never gifted her anything amazing or special, nor did I took her out for dinner nights. So I did not see anything wrong with gifting her an item that she would regularly use and need.

&#x200B;

Now yesterday was my sister's birthday. Everyone was celebrating. When mid way through the event one of her friend suggested her to open her presents. She opened all her gifts one by one and stopped at my gift with a disappointed look on her face, I asked what was wrong? She replied by tossing the gift to her side that she expected more from me and then continued to open others. At that point I was confused as why she would not like her favourite chocolates. Now while everyone was getting ready to sit and eat, she pulled my girlfriend to the washroom with her and about some time later my girlfriend came back with a disappointed and sad look on her face. She was trying to hold back her tears. So I confronted my sister about this and she said ""*that bitch is trying to use and manipulate you*"", I said her to take back her words and apologize to my girlfriend. So now long story short, she did not apologize and and blew up on me and this escalated into a huge fight and me and my girlfriend ended up leaving midway through. Apparently no one except my sister's best friend, my mom and my dad know about this and rest of the party continued as usual. 

&#x200B;

Later I contacted my dad as he is the only one supporting me through this. And apparently she was upset because I did not get her a expensive gift as I got for my girlfriend. Now my mom is saying I was an asshole to her and I ""prioritize"" my girlfriend more than my sister and my birth family.

c2jjld	2019-06-19 16:56:56	broadly	WIBTA if I asked my fiance to rehome their cat	"My fiance and I have been living together for a little over 2 years now and during that time we've kept three pets (2 cats and a small dog) and have fostered several others (all dogs). We both love animals very much and both agree that we want to share our living spaces with as many pets as is reasonable at any given time.

&#x200B;

Recently I got accepted into my ideal graduate program. Not only is this program a perfect fit for my interests and career aspirations, but there's also not even a close second choice. If I want to study what this program offers, I pretty much have to do it within this program. Needles to say, I quickly accepted the offer of admission. The only problem is, this program is in New York City which is a half a country away for us.

&#x200B;

This move presents the both of us with a number of complicated and stressful challenges. We're getting rid of most of our furniture, selling our vehicles, planning out the most cost effective ways to move all of our stuff, and have been channeling almost all of our discretionary income towards saving for the move. This is all complicated by the fact that we're trying to find housing in a notoriously difficult housing market and that we'll be committing to a lease without being able to tour the place in person since we're 1,200 miles away.

&#x200B;

When I mentioned months ago I was considering applying to this program, my fiance and I talked about all the potential complications and came to the conclusion that we would ask my fiance's mom to watch their cat. We both decided that since we're only going to be able to afford a small studio or one bedroom apartment, since the two of our cats don't get along as it is in our three bedroom house, since housing becomes harder to find the more pets you have, and since my fiance's cat has a habit of violently shitting and puking any time she's in a car(keep in mind the 1200 mile car ride up to New York), that it would be necessary to leave her behind in someone else's care.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now from when we came to that agreement and my fiance is telling me that their mom probably wont be able to watch the cat. So, Reddit, WIBTA for insisting that we rehome our cat? I have always said that re-homing never made sense to me and that once someone commits to a pet that it should be for life but now I see how that idea can be complicated. From my view, this is exactly the kind of situation where re-homing is in the best interest of the animal. As I said, our cats don't get along as it is with plenty of room to roam and so squeezing them both into a tiny studio with a small dog does not seem in her best interest. On the other hand, I do feel conflicted. I love my fiance very much and want to do what I can to make them happy whenever reasonable. They're sacrificing a lot already making this move with me and I know that they would be devastated to have to say goodbye to a pet they've kept for well over a decade.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Thanks everyone for your perspective.  You all make a good point that our younger cat (the cat I brought into the relationship) would have an easier time finding a new home than our older cat.  Considering that, it seems to make more sense to try and find a place for my cat.  I hate to do it but I see no other way.  We have tried everything to get them to stop fighting to no avail and I know their quality of life would suffer if they were forced into a tiny apt. 24/7.  Thanks again everyone."	Asshole	0	0
c2jj9f	2019-06-19 16:56:17	greatfoo	WIBTA for telling my roommate I don’t want his friend to move in for a month?	"I have two roommates, let’s call them Joe and Nick. Nick went home to visit family and basically moved out as he won’t be back when our lease ends on the first of August.

So it’s just Joe and I living in our house together. Joe met a guy, lets call him Ted. at his work who’s been there for about 1.5 months. Ted supposedly has a really bad roommate he doesn’t get along and Joe told ted he might be able to stay at our place since there’s an empty room but he wants to go over with it me first. 

Personally I kinda like how quiet it is at the moment and how clean it now with only 2 of us here. Joe told Ted that he’d only have to pay $400 to stay a month and Joe wants to tell Nick that he’s paying $300 to stay in his old room and we use the leftover $100 for teds contribution to utilities. 

Before Nick moved out he was paying $515+utilities per month while Joe and I pay $615+utilities since were in bigger rooms. So even if Ted moved in he’s paying considerably less than Nick and I feel like Joe hasn’t known him long enough to justify it and I haven’t met the guy.  Though, Joe wants to get all 3 of us to go out for drinks so I can meet the guy.

I think one of the reasons why Joe is a bit more willing to offer him another place to stay is because then he’d have another person to hangout with during the day as I’m at work during the day. 

I feel like we’d be giving this guy who I don’t even know a huge favor not even with moving in but also having him pay so much less. This would also be under the table with our landlord not knowing about this.

"So I was at a strip club last Saturday, there was one that stood out to me, smoking hot and her stage show was amazing. When she asked me if I was interested in a private lapdance I was obviously like ""hell yeah!"" so we went back to the couch. I actually then noticed she was wearing a cross necklace, and got a closer look at her tattoos, she had that Christian fish symbol on her arm just under her wrist, and a pretty large cross covered in thorns on her upper left shoulder (actually looked pretty cool admittedly!) So after the dance I asked her kind of jokingly if she was going to work late and go to church tomorrow because I noticed her tattoos and necklace. She responded that she actually goes Saturday nights, so she went earlier and then came here. I was kind of blown away, what she went to church and then a strip club? I thought that was crazy. So I kind of teased her saying ""Oh but wouldn't you need to go again after sinning so much and being a bad girl here?"" and she just kind of laughed but uncomfortably.

As i was saying this i also realized my friend did this often too. Me and her would make plans to hang out and then later she would ask if her boyfriend could come along also. 

I don't want to tell her no, especially since she's always the one providing transportation, so i tell her i don't care, it's up to her.

But whenever he does come along he can't keep his hands off of her. Even when she is driving, which is pretty dangerous. 

When we were talking, we were also planning her birthday dinner in a few days. And the only people going would be me, her and her boyfriend.

She started asking me if i wanted to invite other people along, and i told her no, its her birthday, i'm not going to invite someone she doesn't know just because i'm uncomfortable. I want her birthday to be all about her, not me.

c2jgmx	2019-06-19 16:50:28	sunsetchaser74	AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to go on vacation with his friend?	"For a little background my boyfriend (22M) and I (24F) we’re living together and last winter he decided he wanted to move out and transfer to a different college to finish his degree. Needless to say this caused a lot of heartbreak and drama in our relationship but we didn’t want to throw our last 4 years away and have been working through it. We’ve had good days and bad days for sure. 

I graduated college two years ago and since I started my big girl job I have been dying to go on a real vacation with clear blue water I’ve never been in. However, living where we do and student loans and the price of life, etc. I haven’t been able to afford to pay for both of us to go anywhere fancy. I’ve proposed many different vacations and prices and packages over the last two years but they’ve never gone anywhere. 

He has been at college this first half of summer taking classes and will be taking online classes the second half of summer as well - which means he’ll come back to our apartment. There is a week between summer and fall classes that I asked if he would like me to take a week of vacation days and we could go to the beach or go on a trip and enjoy that last week together before the fall semester. He declined, saying he would rather just chill at home and enjoy a week relaxing at home. “He’s a simple guy, he doesn’t need much” 

Today he texted me saying his friend asked him if he wanted to go to Jamaica, that same week. Boyfriend would like to go. Personally I am very upset because I have wanted to go on a trip together for a long time and he has never been as willing to try to make something work as he is for this trip. His mom is also offering to pay for it as she feels like he needs a vacation after the summer. 

He did invite me on the trip - after I got upset that he wanted to go. He said it would be really cool to go on the trip, but even cooler if I could come along. I would really like to go, but I’m not exactly financially prepared to go but I could maybe figure it out. I also don’t have the vacation days, because once he said that he didn’t want a vacation after school I decided to use my vacation days to go home and visit my family for a week as they live in another state. 

I’m honestly pretty upset that he his trying to make this trip work and wants to go when he never shows the same interest in our trips. It hurts that he would still go and I can’t. And it’s our last week of him living with me before he goes back to school for the fall semester which is also upsetting. Am I the asshole for being upset he wants to go/not wanting him to go?

Flashback to last night, we were out for a party and I had picked her up at her house. I was fine for the entire night until the ride back to her house, that’s when I just felt like I couldn’t do it anymore.

Backstory: this girl has known that I liked her for months now, and there was a time when she did give me a chance but I blew it off because then I was going for another girl... so after that whole ordeal, a month later she began dating a guy. So I had pretty much accepted it, my thing with other girl never took off but her thing with her guy did take off until these past few weeks they’ve been having problems.

Now I get it, she’s seeing somebody and I never really did white knight (throw those I’m better than him comments at her) but I just felt like I could’ve been so much better than him because I knew her, I knew what she likes and hates, what she loves and doesn’t. Her best friend agrees with me. It’s her life, and it’s her taste in guys so I won’t blame her there.

Whenever I was with her, I was happy but at the end of the day I always felt like shit because I knew I could never be with her. It got to the point last night that it just hurt too much.

I have a dog also and yes, dogs bark. Generally, everyone is really good about running interference when the dogs bark at each other or squirrels, birds, the wind, whatever. Dogs are funny at what they choose to bark at.

However, I have a neighbor who adopted two yorkie pups which they keep in a small enclosure in their front yard directly across the street from me and these dogs barked for 3 hours straight on a daily basis in that cage thing they’re in. Before I could work up the nerve to ask them to maybe bring the dogs inside where it’s not a nuisance (or as hot) the barking stopped. That was about 3 weeks of working through it in my head because I’m not confrontational and I didn’t want to be a bitch.

Now the last two days, they’ve put the dogs outside at 5:22am where they bark for the entire time. Oh my Lord. In my opinion I should be allowed to sleep with my windows open until at least 6:30am without having to hear your dog bark. I could close my windows but yorkies are high pitched barkers, windows do not stop the noise. Plus, why should I miss out on the cool night breeze because someone else might put their dog out?

If they bark tomorrow morning I’m probably going to go over there and remind them of the noise ordinance laws and ask them to maybe take the dogs for a walk instead of just putting them out but would it make me an asshole? Dogs bark. Am I being too sensitive about this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2jcer	2019-06-19 16:40:53	TrueHotDog2	AITA for “getting defensive” after almost getting into a non-serious driving accident?	"So I can explain. I was driving at night with my girlfriend. We were going 2 exits down the highway in a different town, and I was using Google Maps to get there. It told me to take exit 18, so I continued along just looking for the number without actually looking at the map. When I was approaching the exit I realized I’m actually *at* the exit, but I thought it was just at the exit *lane* and I thought I had another ~500 feet before the exit itself (which is common on this highway).

So I had to slow down from ~70mph to ~20mph within around 50 feet so I can take the turn. I burned a bit of rubber and my car was almost sliding but I did it and nothing really happened. Worst case scenario I would’ve gone on the grass a little (which is obviously really bad), but even that didn’t happen. Obviously I fucked up, and those ~3 seconds were pretty scary. I said sorry and repeatedly explained my thought process & what happened to my girlfriend (“shit I thought we still had another 500ft, that was scary” etc).


Nothing like that has ever happened before and I explained/understood how I screwed up so I thought we could forget it. But instead my girlfriend went on for 5-10 minutes about the “should haves”.

“You should’ve been going slower in an unfamiliar area, you should’ve been looking at the map, you should’ve instantly profusely apologized” (which I thought I basically did by profusely explaining my error) etc etc

No shit I should have been doing all that, but what good is it going to do now? It happened, luckily nobody got hurt and it was fine. I understand that I fucked up and I understand how it happened. It wasn’t caused by some habit that I need to change like texting or reckless driving, it was just a simple mistake about something I didn’t realize.

So eventually I got a little fed up and snapped back “alright alright, should’ve should’ve should’ve. I get it.” which was a wrong move. She said I was “mocking her” and “getting defensive”, and she got even more upset.

Later that night her mom saw she was upset and asked if she was okay, to which she replied “no, we almost got into a car accident” so then I had to explain to her mom what happened, which was embarrassing and frankly making it sound like a much bigger deal than it really was. In the end it was a simple mistake and nothing happened. Literally every driver has those “close calls” once in a blue moon.  Frankly I think she’s immensely overreacting. AITA?


TL;DR: Close call happened while driving, dumb mistake on my part, everybody was fine, but girlfriend wouldn’t stop with the “should haves” and I got pissed. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

Yesterday was my day off. I woke up around 830 after my other 3 roommates had gone to work, excited to have the place to myself for a few hours. When I walked out of my room, Amy was sitting there in the living room in my roommate's t shirt drinking coffee out of one of our mugs. She looked a little surprised that I was there. I asked her if Steve was here, she said 'No he left a half hour ago.' I told her that I dont think it's appropriate for her to be here if Steve isnt and I asked her to leave.
That night I bring it up to Steve and he informs me that she was spending so much time at our place lately  because she couldnt afford her apartment and had to terminate the lease prematurely so she was basically homeless. I kicked my roommates homeless girlfriend out on to the street. AITA?

Edit bc I think Steve is being unfairly demonized to some extent: he didnt ask her to move in and none of her stuff is in the common space. I think she keeps it all in her car. I think he just opened up the house to her to have a place to stay. He probably just said to her 'Hey you can chill here for today.' I'm not sure how many other times  he has extended the same offer but this is the first I saw of it. 

Mods can we lock this post? My roommate frequents this sub and I dont want him to happen upon this and get salty with me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2jal9	2019-06-19 16:36:45	hpetssteph	AITA - Cell Phone Bill & FIL	"Seeking any insight as to whether I handled this situation wrong: 

My husband and I are on a cell phone plan with his family, total of 6 cell phone lines. Like all cell phone companies, there is a monthly bill generated and our specific cell phone company will break down the cost of each phone for that month which adds to the total amount due. 

I was surprised that our 2 lines out of the 6 costed us about $120 a month considering our phones are paid off. I had the cell phone company email me copies of the bills and when I see the monthly charges for each of our lines, it only adds up to about $50. On top of each line having a individual monthly cost, there is a plan cost of about $120 as well. I thought it would be fair to divide the plan cost by 6 lines, then my husband and I would contribute $40 on top ($20 per line) on top of the $50 for the lines, so we would be paying a total of $90 per month and not $120. This is only a $30 difference and isn't going to break the bank, but we've been paying $120 instead of $90 for a couple years now so the $30 difference does add up. 

I have an pretty open relationship with my in-laws so I decided to text me FIL about this. I made sure to not use any language or wording that would make him feel like he's been overcharging us, but he still took it this way. I believe he felt this way simply because I asked him about. I sent him images of the bill and in his responses he does not discuss them, which leads me to believe a) he didn't get them or b) he purposely overlooked them. He then proceeded to call the cell phone company who also confirmed that the bill is accurate and we should be paying around $80-$90 a month. His response to me was that we should get our own plan because he doesn't want us to think that he's overcharging us. I made it explicitly clear to him that I never thought he was intentionally doing this and that I decided to reach out to him directly because I actually do trust him...I wouldn't have reached out to him if I didn't. I feel that he reacted (instead of responded) and flipped his lid.  

Like anyone else, I just want peace in the family. I had no intentions to make him feel like I don't trust him...I was simply asking him a question about the bill and provided him the copies of the bills.

c2jahv	2019-06-19 16:36:30		WIBTA if I confront my father over birthday celebrations?	"Some important context: I (M19) have a younger brother (M16) who has always struggled with mental illness, to the point of dropping out of school for a while, during which time he was homeschooled by our dad.  Our mum has a job which means she is away from home for long periods, i.e. months at a time. Our dad has always been a stay at home parent, around the time we were old enough for him to go back to work (when my brother was starting secondary school) was when things started to get bad mental health-wise, so he's basically been a carer for my brother since then. I have long felt that because of this, their relationship has been closer and my dad has prioritised him over me. I've talked this over with my dad and with a therapist and I've been feeling better about it for a while, however recently something happened which sparked these feelings again, and I've found myself extremely angry about it, although I think it's quite trivial.

My brother has been doing exams and his mental health has deteriorated again to the point that he has not taken all of his exams and has been in hospital a couple times. In the midst of this it was my birthday, which is also the first one I've had since I moved out. A few days before, my dad transferred me some money to my bank account, saying could I please buy myself some gifts as he was very busy. I was at my parents house for my birthday (my mum is away working), and my dad was out for most of the day as he doesn't like to leave my brother alone at school during his exams in case something happens, so he was just waiting in the car park at my brother's school for several hours. When he got home he gave me an unopened and unwritten birthday card, and said he was sorry he hadn't made or bought a cake this year. I asked if he would come out for dinner with me but he didn't want to leave my brother at home alone (he is a very fussy eater so hard for him to eat in restaurants), I suggested we get takeout but my dad didn't want to drive to collect it, saying he was very tired, so I ended up making pasta for me and my dad. He said that he would make sure to write my card and make me a cake before I left but this didn't end up happening. 

I understand that he's been busy and stuff has been very stressful at home, but I can't help feeling a lot of stuff from my earlier teen years being brought back up, and a lot of bitterness about this. On the other hand, I'm not sure what good can come of confronting him other than making his life harder when I know he's already struggling a lot.

They want everyone to visit the gravesite before heading to lunch. 

Growing up I never had much of a relationship with this woman, as she came into my life around 7 years old. She was always very negative and always complaining about everything making it unbearable to be around her. I really never cared about her and only conversed with her when I was forced. 

After she passed, her children were willed her assets and money, not any grandchildren, but my parents still decided to split up some of the money to gift to the kids as they did not need it. I reluctantly took it as I really didn’t have a relationship with her and used it to pay off a loan. Once we all were given the money and accepted it, the talk of the memorial came up and it felt like the gift of the money was held over our heads to attend. None of us live in the city that it is being held in but are expected to come.

c2j89x	2019-06-19 16:31:38		WIBTA for asking my Step-Grandmother to 'wait her turn' in the kitchen?	"This is kind of long, there's a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I (19M) am currently staying in a house with me, My mother, her husband (my stepfather) and her husbands mother (my Step-grandmother, who we'll call L). L is 86 and is definitely feeling her age, she is fairly immobile and uses 2 walking sticks to get around places. She goes out a fair bit to do standard hobbies that old people do (bingo, gardening that kind of thing) but most of her time during the day consists of her watching TV and moving over to the kitchen to make food. This is where it gets kind of tricky.

L is in the kitchen ALL the time, and by all the time I mean she is ALWAYS there making food or a cup of tea or something. This makes it incredibly hard to do your own thing in the kitchen because, as previously mentioned, L is quite immobile and so it takes forever for her to finish what she's doing. Both me and my Mother get pretty frustrated at this.

My Mother works 12 hour shifts throughout the week and so when she comes home and sees that L is making food or a cup of tea and that she won't be able to do anything in the kitchen until she's done she gets very frustrated. 

She also gets frustrated because L also kind of assumes that my Mother is going to go shopping for her or take her to her Doctor appointments on her days off. Like she'll just be like ""I've wrote a shopping list for you"" or ""My appointment is at x time"" and because my Mother is such a kind soul she won't refuse but instead just do it without question and get frustrated about it. 

What's also frustrating is that L won't wait for people to be done before she comes into the kitchen, she has a VERY specific schedule for what time she eats and so if someone is in there at that time she will come in and start doing her thing and quite frankly just get in the way of what you're trying to do. It's frustrating to the point where I'll just straight up leave the kitchen until she's done before I continue.

It's worth mentioning that L is a very nice lady but that there's just some I guess 'unspoken conflict' between who is in what space at what time. So my question to you Reddit is: WIBTA if I were to talk about this with L to try and make things a little less frustrating for my Mother and I? I've spoke to some friends about this and they've said that I would be an asshole for bringing it up and that I should just put up with it because she's old and slow so I'm not sure if I should or not. What is the Internet's opinion?

c2j89o	2019-06-19 16:31:37		AITA For not wanting to pay for parking to see my friend?	"My best friend lives in the city, I live in the suburbs. I usually go down to see her because she is married and has a kid. I am okay with that. It's usually a 40min drive - with no traffic. With traffic it's about 1hr or more. 

Today she wants to have dinner/drinks for celebrating a last day of class. I'm about it. Problem is that her husband doesn't like me. Long story short - she wanted to leave him for a long time, thought getting married was a mistake, he read through her messages and read me giving her advice if she wants to leave. He thinks I was *telling* her what do to and no longer thinks I am good friend. 

Everytime we have been hanging out, I park in her visitor parking and it's usually when he is out on a trip. If we do go out - she doesn't tell him that she is meeting up with me, always says friends or a party. 

Comes to today. She ends class in the PM. I end work earlier. So I would go home which is a 45mins drive, get ready then travel into the city. I asked her if I can park at her place - but since she will be in class, she is unable to buzz me in. It would be her husband. She obviously doesn't want her husband to know we are meeting, so she suggested I pay for parking near her school. 

I don't want to pay for parking. It's 10bucks... But still.

c2j7jg	2019-06-19 16:29:57	RainbowCRASH2014	AITA for not being able to pay 300€ extra for a damaged Product?	"Hi, first of all the typical disclaimers first time posting, English is not my first language and so on...

&#x200B;

This happend across the last 3 to 4 months and I keep questioning myself if i did something wrong.

A female friend of mine works at the car-dealership of her parents and this spring I decided to order new wheels and tires at their store. I gave her the details of the brand and model I want to have so they can give me an price offer which was about 1k€. I accepted it and my friend ordered them, later that day she told me they should arrive in a week or two since their supplier told them they have about 20 pieces in stock and will send them the next day.

&#x200B;

After 1 week my friend told me that the tires arrived but not the wheels. She talked to the supplier and they told her that they did not have 20 but only 4 wheels in stock of which two where damaged. They would order new ones and send them as soon as they arrived. Two weeks later still nothing. Another week later they told her that they have problems getting the product but it would take another week or two until they have it.

&#x200B;

Now it has been about two month since I placed my order and my friend calls their supplier almost daily to get an answer when they finally will send my rims. Another week has passed and they tell her they now have three wheels and are waiting for the last one. It took them another week until they called my friend that the wheels I wanted are sold out in entire Europe, but they could send a set of the same wheels in a different colour (black instead of white). When my friend called me to ask if this was ok with me even if the black ones will cost about 10€ more per piece, I agreed since it was now summer and I was still driving with my winter tires and the black ones look cool too.

&#x200B;

Now to the (maybe) asshole part. Two weeks have passed and I get a call from my friend. She tells me that there is another problem. The supplier lied again and did not have 4 wheels and that there was only one solution. They send 4 wheels with the least amount of damage and I would have to get them fixed. When I asked my friend what that would cost she told me it would be about 300€. This was way to much for me. I did not have more money to spend and I do not see why I should pay full price plus repairs for a damaged product. Since no one would want to go down with the price or would offer to cover the repair cost I canceled my order and my friend was pretty pissed about that and did not talk to me for the last week. 

I understand that she did a lot and worked through a lot of stress so I would get my stuff, but am I really the asshole for not being able/wanting to spend another 300€ on a damaged Product and canceling my order after 3 months?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2j6fn	2019-06-19 16:27:23		WIBTA If I told my friend that she has gained a lot of weight?	Long story short, I meet this friend our first semester of freshmen year college. (End of 2017). We have been friends know for about two years. When we first meet, she was a little bit overweight; not concerning. When we let out for summer break in between freshmen and sophomore year of college, she put on a ton of weight. If I had to guess she went from around 150 pounds to over 200 pounds in a span of less than a year. Ever since then, she has continued to gain weight. I have never talked to her about it, because I know she is aware of and it upsets her. Yet, I have not seen her do anything to change how she eats or maintain her weight. I am beginning to get really worried about her health. Her mom just posted some pictures of my friend and her family at the beach. My friend looks unrecognizable at this point. For more context, my friend has bad depression and anxiety. She takes medication for it, but I do not think it would be enough for her to gain over 50 lbs.

Here is some backstory. I plan on getting married next year, in October, on 10/10/2020 (numerology ftw). This is exactly 10 years after my fiance and I have started dating, so it seemed fitting. For the wedding party, the only two people I've ever had in my mind to stand up with me are two of my cousins, twins, who have been my closest and best friends throughout my entire life. We've all known for years that whenever one of us gets married, the other two will act as the best men.

Now, suddenly, my cousins have found out that if they reenlist in the military for another 6 years, they will receive a $20k sign on bonus plus $50k towards student debt relief, which, is awesome. Only problem is, they are getting deployed for a year, starting next May and effectively missing our wedding date. When questioned about reenlisting, they both said they didnt want to do it, but they couldnt turn down the money.

These two are my closest friends and I cant honestly see myself doing it with out them, but also they never spoke with us about reenlisting, they actually told us right after we got engaged that they were planning on not reenlisting. So it came to a surprise to us when they announced on Snapchat, without explaining it to us, that they in fact did reenlist. 

Am I the asshole for being mad at them for doing it for the money and missing my wedding date? Or for the potential of having to move everything up 6 months just so they could be present?"		1	0

"So I had a friend (not one of my closest friends but I care about her a lot)who I've known for 12 years now, we're 29 this year, I've been there when she met her BF, got married to him, had children, everything. I love putting in lots of effort into the relationships I care about including planning their birthday parties and surprises if needed, helping out when in a tough situation and so on so forth, if you're important to me, you can count on me no matter what! I don't do these things to expect something in return, I just believe that's what good friends should do, be there for each other.

I went to this friends bachelorette, bridal shower, wedding and reception, and first baby shower, and even went over to help with the babies newborn baby photo-shoot because no-one else was available, RSVP'd on time, got thoughtful gifts, made sure she had a good time at all events and was stress free. I don't regret any of this because I love her and wish her the very best.

My wedding was last year and it was very intimate, I cut out a lot of people because I really just wanted it to be the people that have been there for me and I know will be part of my life forever! This friend RSVP'd, it was her, her husband and baby (she was 6 months pregnant with the next baby during the time of my wedding), she knew it was really intimate because I let everyone know it would be. She didn't come to my bachlorette (I assumed cause she was pregnant), didn't come to my bridal shower, didn't come to my wedding or reception but RSVP'd yes to all events. I was extremely upset but left it as it because I was stressed about all the wedding stuff and I didn't want to create anymore tense situations for myself. She didn't even message me on or after my wedding day to say why she didn't make it, or at least a congratulations (but she liked all my social media posts)! A week after my wedding while I'm on the honeymoon, I get an e-vite for her second baby shower, followed by a whatsapp message saying ""Hope you got the invite and hope you can make it! "". I let her know that I wont be able to and didn't say anything else because I have a lot of other stuff and to be honest really feeling upset and petty.

This all happened a year ago, we haven't talked to each other since then. She messaged me now asking why she wasn't invited to me 1 year anniversary party and that she found out from a mutual friend. I told her what had happened and she blamed it all on pregnancy brain, but didn't say sorry or any kind of acceptable apology. I told her that I think our friendship has run it's course and it's better that we go our separate ways and wish her the very best, I didn't say it in an angry way or anything!

One of my friends called me and told me that I should just forgive her because it happened a year ago and I should just get over it because I'm making her feel bad and left out.

AITA here?

c2iz2v	2019-06-19 16:10:35	LittleContext	AITA for playing guitar while my girlfriend watches a film?	"**EDIT: Thanks so much for all the feedback, I had no idea I would get this many responses! I must admit, it has been quite hard to come to terms with being a certified asshole, but lesson learned... communication is key!**

For 2 years, we have both been studying for our degrees and we only have one room in our apartment to share between us (for studying that is, we have a separate bedroom, bathroom etc.). I have studied for a music degree and she has studied law. Whenever she has needed to study or concentrate, I have been considerate enough to not play. If I desperately need to practise, I will always leave the apartment to go and play at the university rehearsal rooms.

Now that our studies have finished, you would think things would be more relaxed. She asked me if it was all right for her to watch a film. I thought to myself ""Why do you need my permission? Do whatever you want!"". I thought she was asking to be considerate, as if the film was going to disturb *me*. What she actually meant was that I have to sit around and wait for her film to finish before I am allowed to play anything.

This is the crucial thing: I play electric guitar through my computer using **headphones**. I have never once played through an amplifier in all the time that we have lived together, and I don't actually even own one. It's just the ""twanging"" of the strings that annoys her, but it is physically impossible to play any quieter than what I am already doing.

Not only that, but I had a very rare moment of inspiration and I needed to record an idea that I had or else I would have lost it. Is it the best idea in the world? Not really, but I felt that it was important enough that I needed to record it right then and there. This just so happened to be around 20 minutes into her film... And here I am.

Her argument was that ""a band doesn't start playing when you go to the cinema"" and ""I just want to relax without you playing for once""... But this was the first time I've picked up my guitar in over a week since my final exam, and I never play when she is studying (which she doesn't have to do any more).

Granted, she is slightly stressed from looking for jobs all day, so I understand that she wants some time to relax. It was just the way she asked ""is it okay if I watch a film?"". The *way* she asked gave absolutely no indication of what she actually meant, which was ""I am really stressed and I would like to watch this film in peace"", even though I gave no indication that I was about to play guitar (as I said, it was a spur of the moment idea that I thought would not affect her watching the film)."

c2ixwf	2019-06-19 16:07:46	noelle__	AITA For not going in to work today?	"I've been working part time at a clothing store for the past three summers. This clothing store is known for having a Miranda Priestly-type owner who is an absolute tyrant and works everyone 40+ hours despite being part-time. You're lucky if you get 2 days off a week. Although the hours add up to a nice paycheck, it is completely draining and the 8+ hour shifts everyday eliminate any possibility of a social/personal life. 

My manager noticed that I was on the schedule for 6 days straight this week, all 8 to 9 hour shifts, and texted me saying that if I would like a day off to let her know. Usually I would be too shy to ask, but because it is my third summer here, I've gotten more comfortable with speaking up about having a more accommodating schedule. On Sunday, my manager agreed that I could have Wednesday (today) off. 

This morning I get a call from my manager asking where I am because I was supposed to come in at 9:30.

I told her I would come in if I got to take a different day off this week and she told me that wasn't possible, and to just take today off, unless I wanted to come in and help. I chose to stay home.

So we share one washing machine and have agreed on doing the laundry together. So we keep track of who did what how often, so that we keep the work distribution even.

Last week or so, my sister got a new boyfriend. I don't know him but I'm totally fine with it. But today I found one of his (I suppose it was his) underpants while hanging the laundry.
I finished the laundry and went up to my sister to tell her that I would prefer if her boyfriend did his laundry himself or she did it for him, but that it is not my job.

She didn't get my argument and was bugged and said: don't start crying because of one piece of underwear.

So am I the asshole for complaining and saying that it's not my job to wash his underwear?"		1	0

I recently started selling a new product in my local community and needed some t-shirts made up advertising the new products for when I deliver them and show them off at local markets etc.

I looked on line for a price and could have had them made with Vistaprint which is a large online print  company. Instead I decided to keep my business local and contracted a local company to make them up for me despite them being slightly more expensive than the online alternative. I messaged the company to ask for a price for some other Tshirts, signs etc and she quoted me a price.

Recently other people in my area have started selling the same products, i have no issue with this. 

However I have noticed that the local business that I contracted has purchsed the products from another seller AND is recommending that people use that person to purchase the products from instead of me.

The lady at the print company messaged to ask if her quote was acceptable  and i replied that I have decided to purchase these from online supplier. She then had a go about not supporting businesses... My argument is that she knew I sold the products and decided to go to a different supplier so I owe her no loyalty at all."	No A-holes here	0	0

c2ivop	2019-06-19 16:02:38		WIBTA if I leave my cousin's wedding early to go to a friend's wedding	"The title about sums it up. When my friend invited me to his wedding last year, I immediately said yes. At the time, they hadn't officially set the date, but said it would be in fall 2019. Before the end of the year they had set the date and everything was good. I hadn't received an official invitation myself, but one was sent to my boyfriend for the both of us. I made a mental note of the wedding, but never added it to my calendar.

In March of this year, my parents received a save the date from one of my cousins. We're not extremely close to that side of the family, but have standing invitations for major holidays and a family get-together during the summer. Due to a move in 2016, I haven't seen that side of the family in a number of years, as it'd be a 4-5 hour drive each way. I haven't seen this cousin since around 2015 at a different cousin's graduation. The rest of my immediate family were given plus ones, but I was not as I'm unmarried.

I was talking with one of the other people invited to my friend's wedding and realized that both weddings are taking place on the same day, roughly 20 minutes apart. My boyfriend is definitely attending our friend's wedding (he's a groomsman), but I was considering splitting my time by going to my cousin's ceremony, but my friend's reception. Obviously I'd let both couples know before the wedding, but I'm worried I'd be the asshole as weddings are expensive and stressful. I'd really like to attend both, especially since geographically, they're so close together that it's a real possibility.

"My mom’s car is being repaired and she asked if I could drive her to work. This is the first time I’ve ever driven with her in the car before, but we barely left the street before she was already criticizing the way I drive. Fifteen minutes into the drive, she probably already spouted off 20 complaints about my driving skills. Any minuscule mistake I supposedly made, she had to call me out. She yelled at me because I was “too close” to the car in front of me even though I was at least two car distances behind them. She yelled at me because I was going 10 km over the speed limit and was gripping the door handle like she was on a fucking roller coaster. I started feeling very overwhelmed, it felt like I was taking a driving test or something. And I found it difficult to focus on the road when she was bitching in my ear. I was beginning to feel unsafe because she was distracting me so much, so I pulled over to the side of the long rural road and told her to get out and walk herself to work. After some bitching, she got out of the car and I left. If I had to estimate, it’ll probably be a 50 minute walk for her and she’ll most definitely be late.

c2iu7k	2019-06-19 15:59:17		WIBTA not wanting in-laws nearer and potentially putting my foot down?	"Hello I am 30F and SO is 31M. I don't have a great relationship with MIL. She is overbearing, loud, try-hard. She is only ever blatantly crummy to me when SO not around, steps on the boundary of her being the most important woman in his life, or making borderline snarky comments, juuuust enough to upset me but not enough to have any ground to stand on against her. (we have had boundary-stepping issues in the past that SO has scolded her for so she knows I get offended by her easily). The rest of his family is kind of backwoods but decent, however they are very co-dependent and call SO constantly for little shit like helping change air filters, mowing their lawn, looking at their vehicle mechanical issues, etc etc etc list goes on. Currently they live about a 30 minute drive away.

&#x200B;

Anyway its just us two. We currently live in a small town and have plans in our future (only been married 2 years) to move to another city where we can grow together and build our family. SO and his family have lived in this town all their lives, born & raised. In-laws have never even SPOKEN about ANY interest to move because even his extended family lives a little farther out into the country but they are all close (within 3 hours) & they like it here. MIL is also baby hungry-grabby & even tho I've always wanted to have kids with SO, she is seriously killing my mood about even that because I have a feeling her antics will only get worse when children come into the picture.

&#x200B;

So a couple months ago SO & I made it known that we have plans to move to another city where there are more opportunities & things to do. MIL of course got mopey & teary & in a funk for days. I guess she told FIL ""wouldn't it be fun if when they move, we move too?"" like, TO THE SAME PLACE AS US. Well SO & FIL work in the same office & FIL relayed that to SO, who brought it up to me saying, ""I don't really think they'd do that but the fact that she said that doesn't bother you, does it?"" It doesn't bother me that she *said* it, it bothers me thinking that she basically invited herself & it could potentially actually happen. It's not worth starting a fight over ""what-ifs"" and I realize anyone can move wherever the F they want to and we can't stop them but to be completely honest, I was REALLY looking forward to finally escaping her overbearing presence & grip on my SO (I will never admit this to him, its his mother for pete's sake and he's allowed to have one) but I DO NOT want her grippy-ass talon-nails following us to another state. I want my SO & I to be independent and start our own traditions & life styles.

&#x200B;

I feel like in the future if they do in fact move closer to us, it would be marriage-threatening. So, you be the judge because if someone doesn't put their foot down I might, if she brings it up again me telling her simply (but obviously in a nice way) ""NO WE DON'T WANT YOU THERE WITH US.""

c2iu23	2019-06-19 15:58:55		AITA for distancing myself from some of my white friends?	"Ok I know the premise is terrible but I’ll explain. I am a gay Filipino male, and throughout my life I’ve grown up in a majority white and Jewish suburb, and went to schools with the same demographics. Besides the few other Asians, I felt very alone and my race was often the butt of the joke. My friend group had always been around 85% white, and I could never really relate to them, although I did enjoy learning a lot about Jewish culture and such. A lot of casual racism though, for example I was carpooling and some road rage happened with the driver (a friend) saying “oh it was an Asian of course!” Another time a parent confused me with another Asian person who looks nothing like me. Generally, things have just been awkward but I would have looked stupid if I spoke out against these things. I went to a very diverse university in San Francisco however, and met a lot of people who come from the same background as me and have had the same story. I find myself spending more time with non-white friends and admittedly rather spend time with them, that I spend a lot less time with my close friends from high school, MOST who are white. This goes for the same for the white friends I made in college. I find that I flake more with my white friends than my non-white friends (which I know is rude). With my friends of color I find a lot more things that I could relate with them (eg growing up in a ethnic household, becoming a nurse because our parents want us to, etc) that many white people wouldn’t really understand. It’s a breath of fresh air for me, but honestly I feel guilty for leaving behind a lot of my white friends who I really do care about. AITA?

Ps I’m sorry if this offends anyone. I know some people are sensitive about topics like this and I tried to be the least offensive that I could."		1	0
c2it0e	2019-06-19 15:56:36	throwaweigh5555	WIBTA for cancelling plans with my sister after her boyfriend broke up with her?	"My sister and I don’t have the best relationship. Growing up she had a lot of emotional problems that negatively impacted me and my family, and got worse over time. A few years ago she hit rock bottom and has since tried to repair things between us, taking me to concerts and whatnot. While it has helped some, I still haven’t healed from everything that happened. I still have relationship and trust issues because of it.

Enter Dave. Sister meets a man online in February last year, and they start dating shortly after. Dave is a nice enough guy, I think he’s kinda odd, but my sister loves him and he treats her well - that’s what counts. Things get serious, and by November, everyone in my family is abuzz with marriage vibes from the both of them. Unlike (literally all of) her past relationships, we actually thought they’d be together forever - just as much as she did. 

Well, in November, a band that we all love announces a tour date for my city in late June. Sister buys tickets for us (me, her, and her boyfriend) all to go. The day after buying the tickets, however, Dave breaks up with her. She’s absolutely crushed. Right after making plans so far in advance, he just up and leaves her. To this day she’s still upset about it, and finds any reason to mention him whenever she’s around. (which is kind of annoying now tbh)

Though I had my reservations (bc I thought she’d spend the entire time sulking over Dave), I was excited about the concert. I haven’t seen the band in several years, and I often wear a hat with their logo whenever I go out, so this is kind of a big deal to me.

And then... last weekend happened.

At the time, my best friend was in a bind – his lease was almost up, he and his best friend/roommate had a falling out, and he couldn’t find anybody else to room with. So I suggested we move in together, JUST to help him out – nothing more. Well, my sister, who absolutely LOATHES him, sent him messages telling him to stay away from me, yadda yadda. And then she scolded me for even associating with him. She knows I have a hard time making friends, and as such I only have a few, so it hurts that she would try to make me lose one of my closest ones because of her own vendetta. She says she was ""protecting"" me, but I really don't think a 21 year old needs protection from her own friends.

See, I kinda don't want to cancel since her boyfriend already did, and family's gotta stick together, but the thought of going with her literally nauseates me now. I don't want to be around her for hours on end just to listen to music I've already heard before. She could find a replacement fairly easily since it's a pretty high-demand concert. Would I be the asshole for telling her to find somebody else? 

TL;DR: Sister buys concert tickets for me, herself, and her boyfriend. Boyfriend breaks up with her the next day. Now I don’t want to go because she went behind my back in an attempt to ruin one of my closest (and only) friendships. Concert is June 30th. WIBTA for cancelling?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Eventually we agreed that we would have one and one only. My mother had had trouble conceiving and I was concerned that I might too. After a year of no success I was getting worried.

We had booked a holiday and on the day of the flight, I received a call saying that my grandfather had died. I wrestled with whether to cancel the holiday, but my family assured me that my grandfather would not have wanted me to do that to attend his funeral.

My husband also tried to comfort me  and said that we would call the baby after my grandfather, he had a name that worked for both genders.

We enjoyed our holiday and, as it happened, successfully made a baby whilst we were away :)

A daughter was born and we named her after my grandfather. Fast forward a 10 years,  when my sister got pregnant and announced she was naming her baby boy after our grandfather.

c2isoo	2019-06-19 15:55:49	dykea	AITA for expecting my sister to pay me back for her wedding	"My sister is getting married next week. I'm really happy for her but yesterday she told me she didn't actually save up enough money to pay for it all, so now she's sad and upset over her own marriage, which isn't ideal.

Last year,  when she asked me to plan the whole thing, she gave me a budget,  which I stuck to. It wasn't much (because I'm kinda poor and she is just poor) and now she told me she's still almost 2k short because she didn't manage to save up what she thought she would and has dipped into the already existing fund a few times the past year. 

Now obviously, since everything is already planned and it's too late to change things up to save costs, someone has to actually pay for it. So I dipped into my savings to make up for it. 

Now,  usually when my sister needs big loans like this I tell her to forget about it,  because in the past I was a student who didn't have any real expenses. She has a small child and just simply needed the money more than I did. 
This time however I am working and while I still live at home (i do pay my mom rent) ,  the money I was saving up was meant for me to start renting an apartment.

I really don't want to bring money problems into what should be such a beautiful day for her and I know I'm taking away the joy she'll feel that day and I feel like a dick for it.

c2ippu	2019-06-19 15:48:50	peterjmonday	WIBTA if I didn't go to my Grandpa's funeral?	"My grandpa died last night. He was a great man, honestly, he was just one of the kindest people I knew. You wouldn't expect a man his age to be so sensitive and caring, but he really was. I loved him very much, we were never really all that close, but I still loved him the way anyone loves their grandpa. Anyways, since he died on a Tuesday I am guessing that the funeral will probably be on Friday or Saturday. The only problem is that I have plans on Saturday that have been set for about a year with some college friends. We all decided to come out to our families this year with varying levels of acceptance, and now that we are out we thought it would be fun to go to pride in the nearest city to catch up and see each other and have a good time. One of them is driving 4 hours there and back in that day and another is flying from across the country. They are counting on me to be there.

&#x200B;

Like I said I loved my Grandpa very much but since I came out he has been very distant, I don't know if that was because of his health or because of how he felt about me. I said my goodbyes to him just this weekend because we honestly saw this coming. To me, going to the funeral would not serve any purpose, I have already said my goodbyes, I am not a religious person, I think that when you are dead you are dead and while I mourn his death, there really isn't a whole lot of purpose to the funeral because I already said my goodbyes. I don't like funerals. My biggest fear in life is death and going to them gives me an extreme amount of anxiety and depression and loathing I just can't do it.

&#x200B;

 I want my last memory of people to be them, not some religious service that makes everyone cry. When I think about my grandma the first thing I think of is her funeral and I hate that. He was a happy man and I don't think he would have wanted me to cancel my plans just to go be sad. He wouldn't have wanted the thing that I think about first to be my dad crying over his dead body. If it was a purely personal decision I don't think I would go, however, I am worried what my family will think if I do not go. They will probably be upset, and I doubt that they will accept my reasons for not going. They don't understand how I grieve, that I don't need funerals (I don't even really plan on having one for myself), and they don't accept that I am not religious."	No A-holes here	0	0
c2ip61	2019-06-19 15:47:31	rob_4556	WIBTA for giving back my friends cat because I'm unable to take care of it?	"I am a 17 year old boy living alone in a small apartment a few floors up in the UK. Because of the construction of the building, it's all open-flooring, so there's no doors/gates to get through, just stairs to go up to get up floors and to the door.

My friend, let's call her Rosslyn, had her little brother tragically die of cancer at age 12 a few months back. He had a cat that the family owned, but was primarily his cat, that is 4 years old. Due to his death, the family - understandably - find it quite traumatic to have the cat around, and also they just aren't able to take care of him. 

I offered to rehome him, but asked that Rosslyn come to my apartment to check it was all OK, and that she was happy with the arrangement. She came around, said it was OK, and said she'd help financially. Fab.

I'd been told Socks (the cat) was an outdoor cat before. 

To their credit, my friend has done absolutely nothing wrong: she went out, brought loads of litter and a litter tray, lots of food, toys, and even got a collar with my number and address engraved on it. Really helpful.

But I'm really struggling to care for this cat. It's wrecking my home. I woke up at 4am this morning to see the cat had urinated all over my bed. My covers are ruined - I've washed and washed them and the smell and stain isn't budging. My house now constantly smells of litter or cat urine. I am absolutely nuts about having a clean, fresh-smelling house. I must have a crazy number of air fresheners. So you can imagine how insane that, alone is driving me.

I've tried to take him outside and make him navigate the estate/building to be able to make his way outside and then up the stairs to come back, but I just don't want to risk things - I live near a main road. If he was run over, or lost, or ran away, he has a lot of emotional baggage attached to him for the family. My friend wants to visit him. How do you explain ""by the way, sorry I lost your dead little brother's cat that he loved"" ? So I'm sceptical to allow him out. But he's wrecking my home also.

I'm tempted to text her and apologise lots and say I can't look after him, and give them their stuff back. But they got an engraved collar and everything, and spent a lot of money, and was very relieved when I took him off their hands. The cat's beautiful and he's a good boy, but I just cannot live with an animal wrecking my home. It'd drive me nuts.

This is 100% entirely my fault because I offered to take him on and agreed to it; I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into. It was dumb. I didn't expect this much trouble, which is why I feel especially bad: this is *my* fault.

friend last night. He’s a fairly new friend and this was the 2nd time I saw him. I was starving so I ordered some food for myself. He ordered nothing but a sprite ($4). So when the bill came, I obviously told him that I plan on paying for my portion, since it was the majority of the bill. He never even OFFERED to pay for his sprite. So, if he’s going to shameless, so am I. This wasn’t a date, and we aren’t close.

I asked him he had cash for the sprite. He said no. I asked if he had Venmo, and he reluctantly gave me his Venmo handle and I sent the request. I was still a bit surprised that he was literally totally fine with tagging along on my bill without a second thought. This morning, I woke up and saw that the request was incomplete so I sent a reminder. He hasn’t responded. Am I the asshole here for making a big deal over a $4 sprite?

I feel like it’s the principle of the thing, and that it’s extremely rude to assume people (especially those you don’t know well) will pay for you. It seemed like a red flag to me.

c2ioxl	2019-06-19 15:46:59	First-Responder99	WIBTA for organizing a massive no-call-no-show for my EMS agency?	"I work as an EMT for a private company in a large metropolitan area. Since it’s a for-profit company, the priority of every call is to get obtain insurance info so that the company gets paid. I would say about 99% of these calls are very tame and are not life or death. The issue I have is that all the EMTs are making only minimum wage. After months of school and studying for our state exam and hours of preparation, we’re supposed to be satisfied making only minimum wage? My idea is that if I could convince a large number of employees to not show up for work and protest for a fairer wage, something could get done. The company would lose ALOT of money and potentiay lose hundreds of contracts with hospitals. While I do not work for the city, my EMS company works with them and I believe an impact like this could set a better standard for all EMTs in my area. I only do this because even after working 40+ hours a week, I do not make enough to support myself. Some of co-workers have families to take care of! They most likely work 60 hour weeks just have a comfortable salary. My only concern is the well-being of the patients that would not be attended to during this protest. On the other hand, most of us are barely getting by with what we’re gatting paid. So WIBTA for organizing a massive no-show?

Edit: To make a few things clear, this does NOT pertain to 911 emergency calls. This is about interfacility transport calls. Simply put, we take patients from one facility to another (usually a nursing home to their doctor’s appointments). They are never in any unstable state or else they would call 911. However, if by any chance they do become unstable we trained and equipped to respond just like any other EMT.  The logistics of these calls goes somewhat like this: The company has a contract with hospitals and nursing homes allowing us to pick up their patients. Ambulance rides cost thousands of dollars, so insurnace info is always a priority so that the company can make a profit. People are allowed to arrange for transports on their own as well simply by calling our landline. Also, this is based in NYC where the minimum is 15 an hour. While this wage is better than most EMTs in other states, it is not enough to survive with extremely high cost of living in the city."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2iouv	2019-06-19 15:46:49	Jazzscool	AITA for refusing to close the window.	"Right I'd be honest this was a really minor issue but I left it with a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not too sure if this is the right place for this yet, but it seems like the correct location for moral discussions so here goes.

Firstly some context, there's this common room that I share with my brother and mother where we use our computers. Me and my brother both have computers facing the window. I'm on the left and he is at the centre. Normally the default is that the windows are opened with them being pushed to the sides and the centre being open. Lately however I've realised that by opening the window on my side I could let the cool night air in, to cool me down on my side. This however leads to the window being closed on part of my brother's side. (since he is in the centre). After I'm done I simply turn off my computer and leave. Here's the problem, my brother thinks that I should close the window back to its default stage. This is because when I open the window on my side, my monitor blocks like a third to half of the window. Hence there is less airflow into the room. I however argued that if he wanted the window to be open in the centre he is free to do as It is not my responsibility. He retorted that it is as I'm the one changing the default to suit my needs, which result in lower airflow for everyone in the room. Hence I should move it back once I'm done. 

Despite the minimal impact I thought it would have on the room, I did end up agreeing that yes his logic is sound, I'm not the only one in the room, I should move it back.

Yet. I can't help but feel like this is wrong, all the logic seems sound, but my feelings tell me that this isn't fair.

&#x200B;

I have a brother (12) with special needs. He is physically able bodied but has had developmental and behavioral issues his whole life. I grew up helping take care of him and have always looked after him. I am the only other sibling and when my Dad is at work, (parents are divorced) I look after him when it's my Dads week. My brother refuses to do any chores and when I ask him to help clean his room or pick up toys around the house he goes into a tirade. I am a sophomore in college and with my schoolwork and recent breakup I have been physically and mentally exhausted.

&#x200B;

For the last couple months I have been training my brother to do his part around the house and help with basic chores. It basically works just like any other parent would incentive's their kids to do their chores with allowance or whatever. My brother loves to play xbox and I told him that xbox has a new program for xbox live where they let you gain ""X-Points"" by helping around the house and doing chores. So when I need him to help me I just unplug the router and tell him he  ran out of ""X-points"" and that he needs to take out the garbage, clean his room or wash my car. He loves earning ""X-Points"" so much that he keeps coming up to me asking how he can earn them so I've had to get more creative with the tasks he can do so on rare occasions I'll have him do some of the chores I usually do so that I can relax. He seems really happy and I think this will help him become more independent and realize the value of hard work. AITA for getting my brother to finally help out around the house by sort of tricking him into being more independent?

Edit\* So my brother just asked my Mom for more ""X-Points"" for his birthday. I might be in over my head on this one.

So my Mom asked me about how to order more ""X-Points"" online. I don't want to lie to her but judging from the mixed reactions on here I'm not sure how she will react to what I've done. I told her she can order more ""X-points"" by sending money to a Paypal account I have set up under a (hopefully) non suspicious name. She is not technologically savvy so this shouldn't raise any red flags. She said that my brother has been doing so well lately with his therapy and helping her around the house that she wants to surprise him with $500 in X-Points. The thing is though, he's only doing better because of me and not his therapist (shes terrible). Since I'm the reason for his drastic improvement I figure I'll keep $250 and use the rest to take my brother on a shopping spree. He really wants Cyberpunk 2077 and a few other things. He will be ecstatic so Win-Win.

Edit* OK so I think I’ve made a HUGE mistake. I realize now that I shouldn’t have lied to my Mom and should not keep her money. However I don’t know how to give it back without making it obvious that I lied. things are starting to spiral out of control. My brother has been telling his friends about “X-Points” and basically all of them have told him that they don’t exist. He told my Mom and now she’s googling it and asking me what the hell X-Points are?! Looks like my Goose is Cooked."		0	0
c2ikli	2019-06-19 15:37:06		WIBTA If I asked for a donation back?	"I’m in a Facebook support group with 50 women who have shared emotional support and chat to each other over a shared issue for about a year. We have never met, but I feel like I know them and trust them. 

Last week the founder posted that her abusive husband had kicked her out and made her homeless with her three young children, and he’s destroyed their passports. She is from a different country to him and he has pretty much fully isolated her. She said she knew the group rules were no asking for money as were not a fundraising group but a friendship support group but her situation was absolutely desperate.

I sent her £100 which is all I could spare to try and help her travel to the British embassy who I felt sure would want to help a foreign national stranded without passports. Her kids are all British nationals thankfully too.

She didn’t even reply to my message with a thank you or acknowledge it even though others on the group did. Yesterday she posted that her husband has changed his mind and things are fine now. No mention of the donations she received.

£100 is a lot of money to me. I’m a single mother of two young children out of an abusive relationship myself. I sacrificed our well being to give her the money as an emergency to get her out of there and get her children to safety and she fully knew that I am financially struggling. I’m fuming that I didn’t even get a thank you or acknowledgement let alone the fact it turns out she doesn’t need it (well she needs to get out of there, but she’s not leaving now and that’s what the money was for explicitly).

WIBTA if I asked her what’s going on and if she isn’t using it for the purpose I gave it if I could have it back? I do know she is genuinely in a bad situation but we all are and instead of feeling good about helping someone I feel like I’ve lined an abusers pockets without even an acknowledgement or apology from her as I expect she’s given it to him. But I don’t know if I should say something or let it go as my bad judgement call."		1	0
c2ijtd	2019-06-19 15:35:14	Ice-Gold	AITA for kicking my sister off the tv?	"Obligatory mobile apologies, not quite familiar with reddit yet, whatever.

So as I type, my little sister just got off the phone with my mother. I havent gotten a text or call as of yet, but I wouldn't be surprised to receive one sometime soon.

Some context before we get into the actual incident (I'll try to keep this quick). My household has several working computers, one for each family member and during the school year (public school and college) one more for each of us, as well as the one that uses our flatscreen as a monitor. Right now, we're down to my school laptop, my personal laptop, my sister's laptop, and the flatscreen. 

I like to play wizard 101, and I recently hit level 130 (max) on my first account, so I started a new one to start over with a different type of magic, but I want to get through it as quickly as possible. This requires playing on two accounts at the same time, which requires two computers. My school laptop doesnt allow me to open the app, otherwise I'd use it in a heartbeat.

So my sister is out on the couch ""watching"" one of her shows that she's already finished. She also has her phone out and is scrolling through that with the show as background noise. I come in and ask her to either let me use her laptop or let me use the flatscreen, because she can watch Netflix on either of the other two devices she has in her possession. She says no because she wants to watch it on the flatscreen and she doesn't want me to use her laptop. So I trick her into thinking I was just going to take hers anyway (all I actually did was walk in the direction of our rooms and hide in the laundry room) and then went back in the front room to take the remote from her.

Before passing judgment also know that I'm the older sister and I've been pressured by my parents early on to be the bigger person when it comes to dealing with her. This led to an unbalanced relationship between us, where she can usually get away with being selfish and nasty towards me, but the moment I turn it around everyone thinks I'm the problem. I also decided to give up some of my french toast sticks, an entire flavor of cheetos, and a few packs of ramen (bought the ramen with my own money, said she could have exactly one, but didnt say anything when she took the rest). Small things but these sorts of things happen frequently and often on a much larger scale.

So am I the asshole here? Is she? Is this a result of being raised by only children? You tell me.

Edit: I'm 17, she's 14. There isnt much negotiation to be had that I havent already tried. I'd love to not have to do all this jumping around for something as trivial as this, but compromise doesnt work if only one party is giving something up all the time. Beyond that, its summer and neither of us have anything important to do. This is purely a thing of I want to have fun and she wants to have fun, and I dont want to have to keep sacrificing good time for hers. If it were something with any kind of weight, I'd find a way around it.

Edit 2: I guess I'm an asshole. Thank you for your feedback."	Asshole	0	0

c2igv9	2019-06-19 15:28:30	lu-ne	AITA for reporting possible cheating to the professor and making a rant post about the team's award?	"Tl;dr a team is suspected of outsourcing their work in an important senior course. I tell the professors to let them know and to ask about grading. The team receives an award, I make an angry online post. They get summoned by professors and think it's because of my post-award online post. They call me malicious, jealous, vindictive, etc.

&#x200B;

My division at uni has a final group project that is known to be hardcore. There are three professors leading this course. There have been rumors since the beginning that one of the teams was hiring professionals to make their project for them, and in the past we have heard of teams hiring developers and designers to make their projects. One of their members, G, is known to be a bully and a mean girl, and she's known to have hired grad students and other people to do her projects in other classes.

&#x200B;

With the end of the semester and grades approaching I contacted the professors last week to let them know that one of the teams in our class may be outsourcing their project, and I wanted to know how they would take that into account during grading if it was true. They replied that they would like to meet with me at some point to talk about it.

&#x200B;

Our course ended yesterday with an official presentation and other faculty acting as judges. 5 minutes before we started, the professors asked me which team it was. I didn't want to tell but they said it was important and they needed to know, so I told them. One of the professors then said that was the team they suspected.

At the end of the presentations they received the judge's award which upset a lot of people in my class. A classmate tells me that the award was originally given to another team but because they had already received a different award, the judges had to pick someone else.

I was upset about it so I made a post online saying ""one can get top prizes at my university if they hire professionals to do their work"" which was to criticize my school and their system rather than the team.

&#x200B;

This morning, G sends me a bunch of messages about my online post (she isn't my friend so someone must have sent her a screenshot). The professors asked her team to meet and talk about the possible cheating and she thinks it's because of the post I wrote.

G wanted me to apologise, I said I don't feel I have anything to apologise for. So she's basically harassing me, won't stop sending me messages saying that I'm jealous, malicious, vindictive, purposefully spreading fake information, that their work excelled over my team's, that I have malicious intentions to tarnish their reputation and mess with their work.

&#x200B;

 I don't care about her, her team, or their project. I just want everyone to be graded fairly. We've all worked so so so hard for this course. She kept messaging me mean things, so I warned her and then blocked her.

However, I’m always awful at remembering to buy birthday presents in time and as I’m a student, I’m pretty low on cash - so my family end up with some shoddy cheap thing I ran out to buy on the day. 

Of course I could just... get better at saving/planning but... the whole thing feels forced to me. Instead, I want to tell my family that I will buy them gifts when I think of a great idea and when I have extra money - no matter what time of year it is. Like, if I saw a pair of earrings for sale that my mum would love and I'd just been paid, I’d buy them for her and just be like ‘here’s a gift because I appreciate everything you do for me!’ 

I still definitely want to celebrate their birthdays - with a thoughtful card and by being with them and having a family meal etc. It’s just the whole purchasing of a gift that I want to do differently. I love my family and I want to be excited for their birthdays - why do I have to BUY something? Especially when I can't afford anything that any of them actually want. 

My boyfriend and I have a policy that we don’t have to buy each other birthday presents - but we do get each other gifts throughout the year as and when we have extra money or just see something nice that we think the other person would like. For example, my boyfriend really liked a jumper that his brother let him borrow, and when I got paid I bought him his own one and surprised him with it. Similarly, my boyfriend had some extra cash once and when we were out shopping, we both noticed a dress we thought I’d look nice in so he gave me the money to buy it. 

BTW - in turn, I wouldn’t expect birthday presents from them. I honestly just value time spent with my family celebrating my life.  

TLDR; I don’t want to commit to buying my family birthday presents anymore and want to just treat them whenever I can."	Not the A-hole	1	0

Recently moved in with a buddy of mine, really good dude, we get along real well and he has always helped me out when I needed it and vice versa. We moved in together about 2 weeks ago, and there are some cleaning habits that I've noticed and have not brought up yet, but mostly been fine. The man smokes alot of weed, we recently bought weed together and  decided to just communally share it, which was an error on my part, I understimated how much he smokes, but its my fault for not knowing so no biggie on that will buy seperate from now on, but I came home recently after a long travel and I had a bottle of my favourite soft drink in the fridge I was just ready to indulge in. Not a 2l, but a store bought 500 ml that is for one person. When i got home, I noticed a bit of mess which is whatever, he can clean it when he wakes up, but also my drink just fully gone. 

&#x200B;

I think maybe because I was looking forward to it, but I got kind of pissed, and didn't say anything yet, Im not planning on being aggressive, just maybe a casual ""Hey man did you drink the soda in the fridge"" and see what he says, if no remorse, maybe a ""id appreciate it if you didn't drink my drinks man, I was kind of saving that."" 

I've been letting him kind use a bunch of my shit, since moving in, like my computer until he got his back, and my guitars and my jackets. None of these things bother me, because he gave me notice, and would return them in condition, however Im afraid that might have made him feel like, alot of our stuff is more communal then it actually is.

My wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will ALWAYS help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it’s just the right amount of food that I want to eat but she’ll go ahead and take some. 

I’ve asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she’ll get really defensive and say ‘it’s just a little babe, you’ll be fine!’ Except I’m not fine, I’m hungry. And then when I’m hungry I get hangry and I snap at everyone cuz I’m goddamned hungry!

Things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. Wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice
to her, so I gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst I held the goddamn plate and then when I went to get myself some all the cake had finished.

Lately my MIL gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can’t stand spicy food.  I tried that yesterday, I ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. She said no. I went ahead and got pepperoni and jalapeños, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn’t eat it.

There isn't a huge amount of parking around, and I parked my car last Sunday in a spot reasonably close to my house (4 doors down) knowing I wouldn't use it again for a week or so. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday (Tuesday), I went to hospital - husband drove me in his car - for a procedure that requires that I limit sitting up for at least a few days, and ideally, a week. Major abdominal pain, but life has to go on, and, being the UK, I was discharged the same day. Came home in pouring rain last night and went straight to sleep. 

&#x200B;

Husband left for a night away for work early this morning, and I continued to sleep. At 9am my doorbell started ringing frantically, and when I finally stumbled downstairs to open the door found a tradesman from the local water company demanding that I move my car to ""facilitate his day"" (note that it wasn't a necessary move, just would make it easier for him to do something that has absolutely nothing to do with me). I politely but firmly said no, and that I was on bed-rest (from whence I write this post) and unwell and to please not disturb me. A few minutes later my doorbell was being rung again, and the door knocker was getting a bashing. A woman in her 40s told me that I HAD to move my car as the work on her new house needed to be done and it was making the tradesmen take longer to go around my (legally parked) car. I reiterated that I could not drive, and her response was to demand my car keys and that she would ""park in a couple of streets away"". Insurance for cars in the UK is by person, so had she driven my car with my permission and something had happened she wouldn't have been covered in any form. I refused as politely as I could and told her I was returning to rest and recuperate.

She returned every 45 minutes for 4 hours, until I finally told her that she was harassing me and that if she didn't stop I would call the local police. She muttered under her breath and has so far left me alone.

&#x200B;

As a bit of background to my question: my parents divorced when I was 7 or 8, and had joint custody. My father and I have gone through periods where we are closer or further apart - and he's never been very demonstrative of feelings. Roughly 2 years ago, our occasional contact dropped to 0, unless I was initiating it (and sometimes not even then) or if he was sending me a funny GIF on FB. I spent that two years being miserable, and it finally came to a head at Christmas when I declined to go to his family's celebrations because I wasn't interested in showing up to pretend everything was okay when it wasn't. Since then, I've officially started to refer to the relationship as estranged, and my mood improved immensely once I came to terms with that. I just noticed last night that I've been unfriended by him and my stepmom on FB (didn't notice it sooner because I don't really interact on FB much, I only use it for Messenger).

So! I've strongly disliked my name for basically as long as I realized that I could have an opinion of it \[very common for my age firstname + super common middle name + easily mispronounced surname\], and after considering it for many years, I've recently come to the decision that I'm going to change it. I've run the idea past my mother and my aunt (who I live with) and they are both supportive.

Part of the reason for the change is to bring my name more inline with my gender (I'm agender, but closeted outside the internet, and I'm planning on switching to a name that was historically more gender-neutral). The other part is a desire not to keep my father's name, after how much he's hurt me. (I am keeping my first name, but won't be using it publicly, and I'm not going to force anyone who knows me by my birth name to switch unless they want to.)

So, denizens of Reditt: **WIBTA if I send him a copy of the required notice in the local paper (from a city he doesn't live in) and/or the final court documents after the name change is finalized?** I don't plan on sending a letter or anything personal with it, just the notices.

&#x200B;

ETA, since a couple of people have asked: I don't believe there is a legal requirement to notify him. I *think* my intention is to give him an avenue to know how to find me in the future (if he had still been friends with me on FB, he would have seen it that way) and so that he's not blindsided by hearing it from someone else. 

&#x200B;

That said, there have been times in the last two years where I've wanted to lash out at him and make him feel as hurt as he'd made me feel. I recognized that was an unhealthy instinct, and I've been in therapy for it, but I can't rule out that this is an extension of that. \[I know I'd be TA if that's the case!\]"	Not enough info	0	0

Danny (M20) is 20 years old and very clearly autistic. I guess you would call him high functioning, but it honestly doesn’t feel like it. It sounds like he’s pretty book smart, as he has a grasp on what we’re doing in this class, but he has absolutely zero social skills. Absolutely none.

The first thing he ever said to me was that I must be attracted to children  because I want to teach elementary school. He called our TA stupid TO HIS FACE because the projector wouldn’t work. He wastes every bodies time in every lab and is disruptive in lectures.

I’m stuck in a group with him for lab work this semester and I’m honestly through with him. He sits around and reads anime on his phone while we do most of the work, is argumentative about everything whenever he actually does pay attention and routinely fucks up our experiments. He isn’t careful with anything in the lab, which is honestly terrifying as I don’t trust him operate scissors safely, let alone chemicals.

I’ve found it’s easier to simply not acknowledge his existence. Anytime he asks me about anything not biology related, I just don’t answer him. Anytime he asks something related to the class, I don’t answer him. Anytime he tries to copy my lab sheets, I close them and take them away. It’s so much easier than trying to contain or control his bullshit behaviour.

I told a couple of friends about this and they said that I was acting like an asshole. I’ve dealt with difficult people before, but this is next level. I didn’t pay close to $1000 to listen to this autistic guy try and be funny.

EDIT:

Some clarifications.

1) The lab work is not marked. It’s meant as a means of applying our lecture material and to be used as study material for our lab exams.

2) No, I don’t think all people with autism are assholes. No I don’t think being an asshole is a symptom of autism.

I'm more the child-free type, don't care to marry, and am overall just kind of anti-Life Script (I promise in the quietest way possible, I've never shamed or guilted anyone for living differently, and don't actively hate kids or anything but won't be having them myself and am pretty awkward around them).

The table issue: My sister arranged seats at her reception so my mom and my stepdad are sitting at one table and my dad and his girlfriend are sitting at another table. Totally understandable, they get to sit with their respective blood family members. We just found out that my stepdad's oldest son and his wife are coming from the other side of the country to attend the wedding, but not only them, they're bringing their 3 and 4 year old kids. Obviously, my sister has added the 4 of them to the table with my stepdad, mom, me, and my boyfriend.

I feel bad; we don't get to see them too often, but I felt immediately disappointed to hear I'd be sharing a table at this event with two very small kids. This is a late night party type reception and I don't particularly want to worry about my alcohol intake or accidentally cursing in front of the kids if I don't have to. My dad's table isn't full yet, so I asked my sister if my boyfriend and I could be switched to my dad's table.

Cue hysterics. My mom said she can't believe I'd pick my dad over her on such a big family-centered day (they've been divorced 10 years but there's still bad blood between them) and can't believe I'm so ""disgusted"" by kids, especially family kids, that I'm asking to move. My sister is acting like this will ruin her reception because people are going to wonder if my mom and I are fighting or something. The last thing she said to me after we discussed this was ""we'll see,"" but her tone made it seem like we're definitely *not* gonna see.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for asking to switch tables? Should I just drop the subject? I want to confirm to her that my preference is still overwhelmingly to sit with my dad, but at this point I guess I'd accept if it just can't happen logistically."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"Last night my wife and I went into a ""big box"" electronics store to buy a new TV. A friend had told us they had more or less the exact model we were looking for but in a ""dented and damaged"" section of the store so it was like 25% off. 

We went to the customer service section and were completely blown off. I mean we could not have mattered to that guy if we were on fire. We went to the next register and asked her if she knew where we could find the dented and damaged section. She pointed us (didn't even speak to us) to the same guy who had just blown us off. We went back there and now he was frustrated so he finally acknowledged us. We asked him about where to find the ""dented and damaged"" TVs. He said he didn't know. I asked him who would know. He said our best bet was to talk to Brian in the back. I asked him how we would know who Brian was. He said ""look for the black dude"" and clearly indicated he was no longer interested in talking with us. 

We walked back to the back and there was no one back there wearing a blue shirt. So we wandered around and I saw the only African American person in the store (but not wearing a blue polo shirt) so I figured that must be ""Brian."" So I went over and asked him where the dented and damaged section was. He looked at me like I was insane and said polite but firmly ""excuse me?"" I told him the people up front said he would be able to help me find the TV I was looking for. This poor guy then said ""I'm really sorry but I don't work here."" I told him I was sorry and we parted ways. 

I feel like such a massive, idiot, fool, racist, etc... and feel like I almost stepped into a white person trope of thinking all African American's look alike. I don't feel like a racist on a day to day basis but I do this morning.

We’re a military couple, and while he was deployed, he made wearing our rings a big deal. If I’d forget to put my rings on after my shower, or send him selfies that didn’t have my left hand in the picture, he’d automatically accuse me of cheating (I wasn’t) and not wearing my ring to impress other men. I started wearing them on a necklace since I can’t wear my rings when actively working because it’s a safety hazard. This was a whole ordeal that took a lot of time for us to get passed and reach a stable point again. 

Recently, he stopped wearing his ring. I thought it was suspicious, so I asked, and he pulled the work card, which I understand but am skeptical of since he didn’t seem to understand when it was the case for me. Now he’s admitted that he flat out lost it.

I was at a car dealership and got a price for a good car for a better price than was listed, but it was involved in two accidents prior to the car being on the lot. I asked them if they could throw in a new bumper due to the old one having a little crack in it, and a lower price, and they said they would be willing to do that. I’m worried that if there is internal damage to the car from the prior accidents, it will cost me a fortune to fix. So I asked them to write out when replacing the bumper that there is no internal or frame damage to the car when replacing it. However, they want me to sign a physical confirmation before any repairs occur that I will 100% purchase the car at the agreed terms if there is no structural damage to the car.

I haven’t signed anything at all, but both my parents think I can argue a lower price, and they think I am rushing into it (been car searching for a month and a half) without trying to get the price down enough. WIBTA if I decided to back out of the deal?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Back then I had extreme anxiety issues, and I had one teacher in particular that made it way worse. She would always call on me to speak in front of the class, then mock me for being too nervous to speak in front of my peers. 

One day we was reading Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, when I was called on to read. Just 10 minutes prior I had a run-in with my bully in the hallway which triggered my anxiety to a full-blown anxiety attack. I was in no condition to read ""ppp please nnn not ttt today"" I begged. 

My teacher jumped out of her seat. She started screaming Julius Caesar was one of the most important pieces of English literature, and today was the perfect day to read it. She then went on to mock my stutter for another 5 minutes, which felt like an eternity to me. My heart was beating out of my chest, I couldn't breathe, and it felt like my head was going to explode. It took everything I had not to cry in front of everyone. 

Let's rewind 5 minutes, when she jumped out of her chair it rolled 5 ft behind her because it was on wheels.

After she was done humiliating me in front of the entire class, she went to go plop back down into her chair. Holyshit she missed!!! She busted her fucking ass in front of the whole class. The whole class went silent. I got out of my chair and walked over to her. She was just sitting there with her hand out waiting for me to help her up. I pointed right in her face and laughed my fucking ass off!!!

She sent me to ISS for like a week. It was completely worth it. She never really mess with me anymore after that. I only decided to share it with you guys today Karma because an old friend of mine brought it up and called me an asshole for it."		1	0

"Back story: I am a university student living abroad, and I live in a dorm where all the girls live in in either single or double rooms, but there are only two kitchens, one is in the ground floor, and the other is in the first floor.

My room is in the first floor, the girls that live beside my room leave all their kitchen equipment on the kitchen countertop. The clean and dirty ones. 

For example, they cook, leave the used plates/pans and wash them after 5 hours or so, and leave them on the counter top.

One of the main rules of the kitchen is to never leave your belongings there, because it's extremely annoying and insects will eventually invade the place. But of course they ignore said rule and continue to do so. 

I am tired and done with this behaviour, and no one seems to do anything about it, I want to throw all their stuff in the trash, but a part of me feels bad, what to do you think?

"I recently have started taking therapy and due to this, my therapist wanted me to get a physical from a doctor and get screened for ADHD. I went to the doctor and my physical was fine, after the screening though. He mentioned that he didn’t have a great background with ADHD, but he said it was apparent I had it yet he was scared to prescribe or diagnose as it also mixed in with anxiety (which is common for adults with adhd). 
I’m only 18 years old so I’m not paying for any of this, I’m thankful my parents are trying to help me. The only problem is my mom, she refuses to let me seek any sort of medication. Once I told her my doctor prescribed me an antidepressant, she somewhat went off on me. I told her he mentioned that if things were worse then to stop taking it entirely. She claimed I would be withdrawing from it after I stopped ( I would’ve been taking them for 2 weeks, imo not much room for withdrawals and an addiction to build up). After I got back home, she mentioned she wanted me to see another doctor. But I told her no, she seemed upset and I told her that I didn’t care anymore and I’ll just deal with it.

c2hj1c	2019-06-19 14:08:10	CoRv4	AITA for not wanting to meet my GF's new friends?	"I'll preface this a little by saying my girlfriend doesn't have many friends, so she was pretty excited to make some new ones at a new job. It's a very small company, and several of the people there are either dating or married to each other. 

There's one girl (we'll call her Kelly) who my GF works with everyday. Kelly's boyfriend, Ken, also works there. My girlfriend has started becoming friends with the two of them. As it turns out, Kelly has really taken to my GF, and apparently feels very comfortable with her. So comfortable, in fact, that while they were hanging out for the first time, she told my GF a lot of personal things, including that she cheated on her boyfriend (Ken) a week prior. Ken doesn't know. 

So my girlfriend is obviously a little taken back by this and didn't know why Kelly felt comfortable enough to tell her all of this personal stuff, and told me that it felt like an episode of Jerry Springer at this new job. She also regrets telling me about this situation as it was personal, but I think she was just caught by surprise. 

Anyways, this was a couple weeks ago, and a discussion came up last night between me and my girlfriend. She's upset at me for not wanting to currently meet Kelly and Ken. I told her that I don't feel comfortable meeting this guy who's been cheated on and doesn't have any idea. I feel like it would be difficult and unfair to look him in the eyes and act like everything's fine with them. It'd be different if he knew. I understand that it's not my place to get in the middle of their relationship, so I would not be the one to tell him. But I'd rather avoid that whole situation in the first place.

Tl;dr: my girlfriend made friends with a couple. The girl is cheating on the guy and he doesn't know. I don't want to meet him knowing this fact. My girlfriend is slightly upset with me for it.

c2hinj	2019-06-19 14:07:14	Azurmondial	AITA Almost had sex with a taken chick	"This is a throwaway account.

&#x200B;

This happened some days back, a girl I know had a birthday party and invited me, the party was great and it was a whole day affair. 

&#x200B;

I wasn't particularly hungry that day so I didn't really eat anything but I did consume a bottle of jack and a couple of joints over the course of the day. I haven't drunk anything in quite some time cause im trying to lose weight.

&#x200B;

Now people left pretty early and at the end I don't know exactly what time there were only me, her and her boyfriend left there. Before this day I didn't even know she had a boyfriend because the week before was kindy flirty with her, I mean she wanted us to go do some Molly just the two of us at the end of the month. It's not something you just do with anyone. Well then the boyfriend left somewhere for an indeterminate amount of time (I think it was a few hours at least). That's fine. We were both pretty hammered at this time.

&#x200B;

So we were sitting on the bench talking a bit and we did have our arms around each other but I didn't really make any advances on her, I didn't even want to make any real advances on her. Fine you have a BF I can live with that. Then she kissed me on the cheek and that's fine its just a kiss. I kiss her on top of the head things are ok. She then kisses me again this time a bit closer to the mouth. Ok...fine, this is still not a problem she probably just missed while trying to kiss my cheek. Next time she kisses me directly on the mouth and I kiss her back. Then we just start making out. During all of this I never made the first move, but after that kiss I just couldn't hold back.

&#x200B;

This off course escalated to the point where we almost had sex, but I just couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to do it, to go all the way, we were both wasted, she was telling me to fuck her, she said to please fuck her, but it just didn't seem right. It was at this point that her boyfriend showed up, finding us both half naked.

&#x200B;

Harsh words were said, but it didn't come to blows. Since he was her ride he then took her home I called a cab.

&#x200B;

I waited like a day for her to call me. I was happy she was willing to listen to my side of it, cause she claims she can't remember anything (which...really was what I expected, it's the best excuse one can have). I told her the truth about what happened, as far as I remember it. I'll get to see her at work cause were coworkers but i doubt we'll have anymore fascinating conversations beyond, hey and good morning and the dynamic should really be awkward now.

&#x200B;

I'm just so sad how it all turned out. She's BTW incredibly attractive, also an extremely smart chick, she's just all around amazing. I think, almost perfect woman could sum her up pretty nicely.

&#x200B;

So Am I The Asshole here? I probably am, but I haven't been with a chick in quite a while and I was so drunk and high and then this amazing girl starts making out with me. I mean...I'm only human."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2hhnn	2019-06-19 14:04:43		AITA for putting up a girl's name as the WIFI Name?	"Context: This happened some years ago, when i was in college. There was this girl\[let's call her Lynn\]studying with me, and was reasonably good looking, and had a tremendous wit. Long story short, I was sort of attracted to her. Now, living in a society where looks and money and connections matter more than anything, I knew i had zero chance of her saying yes to me. But, since I didn't want my attraction to colour my every interaction with her, I talked to her in private and confessed my attraction to her. I assured her that i wasn't expecting reciprocation, and i just wanted her to know as to why i would be staying away from her. And begged her not to tell anyone. She took it pretty well, all things considered.

Now, fast forward 8 months. She is in a relationship with the son of a professor, and things are going well. i have other stuff to worry about, so don't really care much too. So, we are at this party\[the entire class\], and we have this game of truth and dare going. So, one of this lady's friends\[call her Annie\] was running the whole thing. So, the bottle points at me, and I choose Dare. And she asks me to ask my crush out. Now, i refuse, saying there is no one. And Annie gets this nasty smile, and blurts out that wasn't what i had told Lynn. And then procceded to tell everyone that i secretly still liked Lynn. Now, this wouldn't have been a problem, except now i became the laughing stock of the class. My own friends began to mock me for weeks. I couldn't walk half a corridor before some taunt or the other made it's way to me. 

Now, her boyfriend sort of thought that I still liked her, and cornered me. Threats were floated, and the whole ''she's mine, stay away. And you wouldn't really stand a chance with her.""

And that's when i decided that I had enough of this. I changed the WIFI name to her name, separated by periods\[J.E.R.R.Y\], and simply left it there.

And the hate and snide commentary has intensified ever since. She called me up furious at my act, but then i reminded her that i had never really made a move on her, never asked her iut, and that i had begged her not to tell anyone because of this very reason. Since she had no problem telling her friends, then I wouldn't have any expressing my attraction for her this way. 

&#x200B;

I left the backpack on top of her bed to let her know I found it, and berated her for doing the thing we agreed on her not doing again, now she isn't speaking to me, I know I sound ungrateful but I can't enjoy it when I know she buys nothing for herself, and I can't buy the things I want because she beat me to the punch with something she thinks I want, what should i do	Asshole	0	0

I’m in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend, we like to Skype with each other and watch movies or shows on Skype together. It’s a thing we both look forward too. I gave him my Netflix log in so we could keep doing that after he couldn’t access his.
Anyway I told the kid a couple weeks back that blackmirror was back on Netflix. We watched the majority together when we we weren’t long distance.
Cut to yesterday when we managed to Skype after 2 weeks. He suggests we watch something. I suggest black mirror as I’ve been pumped to watch it but was waiting for him. 
I go on to see that he has been on my account and has watched all three.(plus a bunch of other crap that’s going to mess with my suggested movies on Netflix). THE BETRAYAL. I’m pissed.

He seems to be quite into it.

So I’ve been FWB with this guy for about a month or two now. He’s someone who is relatively new in my friend group, and he is also friends with my best friend. The other day I was over his house, post coitus, so we were just sitting in his room, on our phones and talking. At some point I had gotten on top of him and his phone was open and facing up (I think he was using Instagram or something), and I saw something that bothered me a bit. It was several pictures of my best friend, laying on what seemed to be his bed, topless. I didn’t get a good look at the pictures (they were in the typical photo grid format), and I also didn’t want to stare too hard and be nosy. However, I’m fairly sure that’s what they were. 

On one side, I kind of want to know what those pictures were and if they are sleeping together, and on the other, I know it’s none of my business what the two of them do and I should just leave it alone. We aren’t in a relationship and anyone else he sleeps with is his business and I feel like I don’t have grounds to ask. And I also don’t know if I have grounds to ask my best friend either. WIBTA?"

My girlfriend, currently doing marketing has forever wanted to do product design. She's even gone to art school prior to this and is extremely good at drawing. She wanted to learn 3d modelling as it was allegedly a ""huge portion"" of her job, so she decided to go for classes. Only after a day, she quit, saying it wasn't ""what was best for her"" to learn from a teacher and she'd learn best on her own.

On of the nights she was staying up and learning, I dropped in to see her renders. Now personally, I have done a bit of rendering myself so I may not still be the best judge but I'd say I can make a fair judgement about it regardless and frankly, she's not great. Now don't get me wrong here, she's brilliant at marketing and I think she's having a stage in her life where she'd rather pursue something she enjoys, which is fair enough but I wanted her to make a distinction between her career and her hobby. She's been learning this for 3 months now.

So yesterday I sat down with her and said I'd support her unconditionally regardless of what path she finally takes but I think that she would be better off working in marketing because of how brilliant she is at it and that maybe she should wait a while before really thinking of taking up product design.

The last straw came the other day when I came home from work and walked into the spare room only to be greeted by a bottle of piss in the centre of a room that isn’t even his. 

I was wondering if how and why it is there but I can’t seem to get an answer out of him as to how it got in there which leads me to believe he has that many piss bottles he is losing track. 

After this I kicked the bottle of piss into his door and said that the next time I see a piss bottle laying around I will post it on my snapchat and his and mine Facebook and tell everyone what he does and how fucking disgusting it is. 

Tl;DR
Housemate pisses in bottles and leaves them lying around I told him I would be publicly embarrassing him the next time it happens, WIBTA?"		1	0

c2hd45	2019-06-19 13:53:24	Awakened4xo	AITA for not going to a concert with my husband as he was aggressive with me the evening before?	"We had plans to go to a concert that my husband has wanted to go to for many years. The evening before the concert my husband got upset over something extremely trivial. I laughed at and repeated a comment someone else made which he found hurtful. The comment was not personal about him, was actually quite true, and was definitely said in jest by someone who is extremely close to us both.

That night my husband expressed his dissatisfaction with what I had done on the way home by shouting and swearing at me, then purposely blocking the entrance to our home so I would have to ask him to move to open it. This is not the first time he has done these kinds of things and I have told him previously that when he treats me this way, I find it disrespectful and hurtful, it chips away at my love for him, and I don't want to spend time with him. I was really hurt and said I no longer wanted to go to the concert with him, and he has been unhappy ever since and pretty much giving me the silent treatment.

AITA for not going to the concert? Was this a poor consequence?

FYI I have asked him to get help in managing his anger, but he tells me I just need to focus on sorting out my own issues.

&#x200B;

Update: I purposely didn't put what the comment was as it would be outing. I do feel like I'm a fair person and if I felt the comment could be perceived as hurtful I would have said so. Also, does any comment warrant this kind of behaviour anyway? My husband acknowledges he has a temper that he can't control. He's just trying to make me feel awful about not going with him to the 'concert of his dreams'. I forgot to add that he did apologise the following day before the concert, but I think that was just in a bid to have me go with him. Had there been no concert, there wouldn't have been an apology I'm sure."	Not enough info	0	0

c2hb1k	2019-06-19 13:47:55		AITA for being mad my ex boyfriend didn't tell me about my shared Google Calendar for two years?	"Hey Reddit. Really curious if I am in the wrong here. 

Me and my ex boyfriend broke up around 2 years ago. We didn't end it on good terms, so to say. He broke my trust a million times and didn't respect me or my boundaries. We've been together for over 6 years and lived together the last year of our relationship. 

One of our (milder) problems was him always planning stuff while we planned to do something together, and him always using the same excuse of not knowing when I had a day off. I gave him access to my personal Google Calendar back then, because I figured he wouldn't be able to use the same excuse anymore. He refused to use it and turned the notifications off. While we never really used it together and not much later broke up, I forgot about my shared Google Calendar. 

Skip forward 2 years. Me being together with my new boyfriend and living happily. Lucky to not ever speak to my asshole-ex anymore. Until he texted me today. He asked if I could PLEASE stop sharing my Google Calendar with him, becease he didn't like to keep seeing all of my appointments. 

I was flabbergasted. I've been using my Google Calendar on a daily basis for the last two years and the thought never even occured to me that I once shared it with him. I asked why he decided to tell me just now, after two years. He then told me he just got a new phone and that's why he saw my Google Calendar again. Don't really know if I should buy that, because he has a history of being very nosy (since we broke up). 

I feel stupid that I never thought of it and never checked in the past two years, but I do feel like he has been lurking around and feel kind of mad that he told me just now.

Things didn’t go too well and she came home to tell me she wanted a divorce. I’m complying as much as I can and I’m trying to be nice and go out of my way for her still through the process but now she’s saying that she wants me to move out immediately. 

My name is on the lease. I told her I can’t afford to pay the rent because I have court fees for some stupid stuff I got into on vacation with her, my car, my phone my insurance and some other things. I’ve just recently gotten a job here. I was out of town visiting my family for a month so I came home and got one as soon as possible, about 2 weeks after I got home. I’m still waiting on my first paycheck. 

We’ve had an agreement where she pays for the rent/power/utilities and I pay for everything else. Things were a little rough for a bit and I didn’t work as much as I should (Uber and lyft) considering the traffic made it impossible to make as much money as I did before. She’s given the money to pay for our housing by the army for being married. I think it’s only right she uses it for the apartment, not her personal gain, regardless of our marital situation.  she’s given 1600 a month for our 799 a month apartment and all this has been within the past week.
She doesn’t agree and she’s saying she’s only giving me half the rent and she’s cutting off the power.

c2h9c8	2019-06-19 13:43:45		AITA for not being around as much as I should have for my dad?	"This isn’t really a interpersonal conflict story, but a self-conflict story that I kinda still beat myself up over.

Last year I was woken up at 8am in my home by loud ringing at the door. I open it to find my brother and mother standing there. They had told me that my dad who had a stroke a few weeks back had another seizure and passed away while being transported between two hospitals. Obviously, I was distraught and completely shocked I couldn’t even cry. Once family left and I was alone again (this is hours later mind you) I was devastated. I loved my father very much, but there was some guilt hanging over me.

This is the part I feel terrible about:
I live in a city about 1.5 hours south of where my dad lived. I knew he was in the hospital for a few weeks, and I came up to visit two or three times during the weeks, and only stayed for an hour at most on each visit. It was very hard to see him motionless and unconscious, so I had to leave. Anyways, my grandmother and MIL stayed non stop. Never left the place practically, but the only reason I didn’t stay longer was because we assumed that he would get better and live out his life with a stroke that would possibly paralyze one half of his body. With this in mind, I feel like I tried to ignore any signs that he may pass away. 

I feel like I had judgement on me from others who stayed longer as it seemed like I was very self centered and didn’t care to be there. Which of course is not true in my eyes....

So, am I the asshole for not being there as much as everyone else?"		1	0

c2h8z4	2019-06-19 13:42:45	fakenewsdaily	AITA for kicking out both of my housemates	"Background: I, the leaseholder, have lived in this house for three years. It is fully furnished exclusively by me. I have two housemates, F and N, who moved in around six and four months ago respectively, who each pay rent to me and I pay Rent to the landlord. Which I believe is a fairly normal arrangement. 

N failed to pay rent on time four rent cycles in a row. The third time I sat her down and said that if it happened again I would be asking her to leave. She cried and apologized and begged me not to kick her out. The following cycle, despite my timely reminder, she again failed to give me rent money and I was forced to cover her again. Despite her tears and tantrums I served her notice the following day and gave her 28 days notice. I don't think this is asshole territory yet. 

I hate living with both of them. Neither one cleans, F has left the open flame on the stovetop on for a whole night while we were asleep, leaves the lights on, leaves the aircon on all day, typical childish rubbish. N also has not cleaned a single facility since moving in. There is constantly food scraps on the kitchen bench tops and the floors are filthy. Neither have cleaned the floors since moving in six months ago, despite me asking repeatedly. F brought a dog home for a week without asking despite there being no pets allowed. 

I am a clean person and want my living spaces to be habitable. I am aware that dirt won't kill me and that none of these things are actually causing me any harm, they're just preferences. I have just received a substantial pay increase and can afford to rent the whole house to myself which honestly is all I want. To be blatantly honest I simply do not like these people and the way they live. I don't get along with them and they make my life very stressful.

Once N gave me solid reason to ask her to go, I used it as an opportunity to ask them both to vacate. I gave both 28 days notice and during a time of the year that is typically very busy for the rental market. F has come back to me and threatened legal action, demanding that I leave instead, insisting that I have no right to demand they leave and that it is my responsibility to find suitable living arrangements for myself. He said I must sign the lease over to him otherwise I'm just being a bitch. 

Have I missed a rental etiquette lesson here? Of course I have ulterior motives for asking them to leave, but isn't that my right as the tenant? Sorry if this is obvious, I don't think I'm being an asshole I'm just trying to look after myself. However the two housemates are insisting that I'm being unreasonable and an asshole."

"Background: My mom and I live together in a ""rented"" home that is owned by a family member. The family member pays all the taxes and upkeep costs and my mom will inherit when the family member passes away. She couldn't be trusted according to my family member, not to mortgage or lose the home. My mom and me share home expenses for the utilities and household supplies, cars and cell phones are each individuals own responsibilities. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I came back from a week long trip in the afternoon. It took me two hours to get home and I was planning on hanging out with my bf. Because I was tired and his place was mess, he asked to come over. We had planned to hang out that night since it's been a week since I've seen him. My mom has previously told me it's okay for me to ask her to leave if I have a guy over or friends. This is the first time I've taken her up on her offer, because I knew we would be loud + I won't get as into it I have to keep quiet. She said fine, went over to her boyfriend house. She passed my bf on the way out and said she was being kicked out. Immensely embarrassing. 

She has a guy she's been dating for a few months, R, who she dated when I was a kid. R is creepy. R tried to drunk kiss my 25 year old sister last month, which my mom forgave him for since it was a ""mistake."" R was upset my mom got ""kicked out"" and we didn't go to bf's place. He was annoyed my mom had been over his house to many times that week. My mom just called me upset because ""R"" was saying she shouldn't be kicked out of her own home because of me. I told my mom she made the offer before. I didn't force her to do anything, I asked and she complied. I also told her how inappropriate it was to tell my bf about a favor I asked from her. Like yeah, I was planning to have my bf come over and for us to have privacy, but I don't need her to spell it out to him. What goes on between my mother and I, he doesn't need to know. My mom is angry at me now because of the things R said and because she feels like I pushed her into going over to his house and causing a fight between them. AITA?"		1	0
c2h7jq	2019-06-19 13:39:08	throwaway24yi89976	WIBTA if I moved out, which screws my ex over big time?	"So first things first, me (24m) and her (24f) broke up recently. We have been living together for a year and a half, and we have been dating longer.

 However through a very large portion of that, I was not in a place where I was self sufficient so I never brought up problems in our relationship for fear of her leaving and me being homeless and such.  

I have since got a job that would allow me to live on my own, and so I started bringing up the problems in our relationship, more specifically problems I have with her as a person, which led us to break up. 

She is not in a financial situation where she could live on her own unless she got VERY lucky and found some cheap apartment, but that seems unlikely considering where we live. 

Living with her after breaking up is very weird and I want to leave but it feels... bad. I've been told she isn't my responsibility and I should just leave but I'm not sure if that's a good idea. 

Would I be an asshole if I just gave her notice (probably like a month or two) and left?

Edit: I guess I should have given more information. 
We are both on the lease for a 1 bedroom apartment, it renews in april. I want to remove myself from the lease and leave.
Also
I have had a good job for over a year now, and I told her about these problems over a year ago, and she never really did anything about them and they got worse over time (personal hygeiene, attitude, outlook on life, etc) and I have finally decided that I'm done dealing with that I guess?"

c2h1wb	2019-06-19 13:24:24	Duriiam	AITA for not wanting my ex to sit with my friend group at lunch?	"Buckle up, this might take a little while.


Some context;

Our breakup was terrible. We dated for a few months and for the last one he already gave up on the relationship and had decided that he was going to break up with me. He lead me on and everything, even telling everyone in my old friend group before hand, then gave the “its not you it’s me” speech. 

I was beyond frustrated that my old friend group did that and left them with him and found another group of friends (in high school BTW). This group is actually positive and I know will have my back.



Now back to the main story:

So one day I see my ex sit down at our cafeteria table. Makes me feel a bit confused, as this is seemingly out of nowhere. This group of friends never speaks to him outside of one of us. Later found out that he came here because the old friend group had a falling out.

So he starts introducing himself and what not, which begins to agitate me. I’m a very emotional guy, but I’m also really loud and proud. I feel like I can’t be myself around him because of the bad blood between us (that tends to happen when your ex tells all your old friends about breaking up with you in passing). 

My friends have been joining in conversations with him and I feel sort of left out of the picture when he’s around. Some of them are purposefully shoving it in my face and laughing about the fact that he’s my ex while others know I don’t like it and are telling me to ignore it.

I’m considering just telling him to sit somewhere else, but for now have just been taking his spot since I know he won’t sit there if I’m there.

I can’t choose who my friends are friends with, but my ideology behind our break up was that he got the old friend group that didn’t treat me properly and I’d find my own. And I did. 

I don’t want my friends to get upset but at the same time I don’t want him to amalgamate into our group.

TL;DR: Ex boyfriend now sitting at my cafeteria table and it’s making me uncomfortable so I want him to leave but am worried my friends will get mad at me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2h0pn	2019-06-19 13:21:14		AITA for resenting my wife who has refused to go to a single family event with me for 15 years?	"I \[61m\] am sure that she \[57f\] hates my family due to a misunderstanding. I was present at the time and what she claims to be a snub was actually a bad attempt at a joke by my sister, but regardless, it's been 15 years and my wife won't budge.

If I want to go to any family event, I have to go by myself. She is very strict about this and has not accompanied me on a family visit since. This drives me nuts but my wife doesn't see the problem.

In fact, she sees this as the perfect solution even though every time I go (alone again) to a family event I end up anguished and when I get home I have a face, which leads to a big fight. So her solution isn't so perfect because it works for her, but obviously not me.

I'm an enabler and can compartmentalize, and I let her get away with this for years, suffering through many weddings and parties by myself, feeling like an asshole whose wife inexplicably ghosted the family for no apparent reason but as we get older it gets harder and I get more resentful. I feel like I'm missing out on all the family life where people drop over just to visit or have barbecues, because if they do she will leave the house. Even though I never say anything, I'm a little transparent, my face always gives me away so everyone knows I don't like it, and lately some relatives have acted like they have pity on me. As they see it, my wife doesn't love me enough put up with my in-laws. 

It bears mentioning that I have a corporate job and I am financially supporting many people in her family and have for years, and I'm very happy to do it because after all they're my family, too. I got to any and all of her family events, never a complaint. I see it as my responsibility to love her family, and I do. It's part of my commitment to her as a spouse.

So here's the crazy thing - outside of this, we have a wonderful relationship. 

But if my sister is the devil in this story, why write off my whole family? She hasn't even met half of them. Is this a phobia or some kind of illness? I know she's not agoraphobic.  

My wife is a beautiful woman and worked as a runway model in Paris and New York years ago. She has gained some weight, ok a good deal of weight, but I certainly don't care, I have gained weight too and I still find her quite hot. But can this really be about not wanting to be seen in public by people who may comment on her weight gain among themselves? One of her relatives was quite blunt about it and she's sensitive.

Should I just get over this and keep going to family events alone, and suck it up? Or somehow force her into facing the family, and hope that things don't get much, much worse? AITA and I should agree with her that her solution of steering clear of these (imaginary) enemies is an acceptable idea? This would keep peace at home but force me to continue to attend family events alone, for the rest of my life, and it will certainly continue to bother me a lot, especially as we grow older and depend more on family."

I am lucky enough to be part of a hugely dynamic team and that involves meeting people from Head Office pretty often. We pull in huge figures annually as a team so usually we are pretty much a powerhouse of our own and in HO’s good graces all the time. 

This morning I followed a blacked out m5 into my workplace, which are NOT the cars that head office drives. They usually roll around in Audi’s, and we are also given company Audi’s to drive. He was in front of me as we entered the parking lot and I saw he buzzed in to the gatehouse to be let through. Obviously he didn’t have an ID pass which made me suspicious of him. He had been BLARING music with a heavy bass, which is normal for London but absolutely NOT normal in my corporate environment. 

As he was in front of me this guy sped through the parking lot and took the last managers car parking bay, which is closest to our offices and bigger than the usual bays. 

I was gotta admit I was pissed off so I approached him after I parked up as he was still in the car and I asked him if he had clearance to be here and to show me ID. He was a 30’s black guy in a suit, and he just said he was a visitor and showed me a German passport. I told him he was parked in a managers spot and told him to move his car as well as to report into reception immediately because usually the guards at the gatehouse give visitor passes straight away but this guy didn’t have one. He didn’t look happy but moved his car and really sarcastically said before he moved ‘I had no idea I was meant to report to reception, thanks’ after that I walked in to work and forgot about him. 

By lunchtime my boss pulled me in and told me that our fucking regional manager had done a surprise spot check visit today, and had been less than impressed with my rudeness. I tried to defend myself but my boss said that I wasn’t wrong for asking for ID but I was wrong for handling it rudely and he said that the regional made it clear that our entire worksite needs a refresher on hospitality. 

In my eyes, I wasn’t rude, I had no idea who this guy was and I was just doing my job. 

AITA?,

EEDIT: I forgot to type this in my OP but my boss said the regional felt my questioning had racial undertones to it which it DIDNT. That’s why I put ‘he happened to be black’ in my title."	Asshole	0	0

All of the other kids are another race. Some of the kids have started calling her ""tree bark brown.""  I don't think they use it as a nickname for her, but they will refer to her skin like ""you're as brown as that tree"" or  ""you're, like, tree bark brown."" 

To clarify, I don't know if they meant it as a bad thing -- and she says it doesn't sound like an insult and that she isn't offended by it - but she has some trouble with social cues.

It troubles me that I've only heard them make up names when the kids are minorities. There was a girl named Tamayo who used to attend the school, but kids had started to call her Tamayonnaise. She dropped out in the middle of last year, and I assumed it was because of the bullying. It's a year-round school, and she is back now.

The rest of her wedding party is fit and skinny like I’m working towards, and they look gorgeous in the dresses, but even these sweet girls couldn’t keep their expressions neutral when they saw me in it. It’s bad. 

My cousin is dead set on keeping these dresses and since it’s her wedding, I’m not upset about that. But I asked her if I could bow out of the party and while she agreed, she was also upset. She said it’s her one special day and she wants me to be in the party, and the bride gets to pick the dress, and that she has been in some ugly dresses in other weddings but sucked it up for the bride.

Maybe I am being selfish, but I cannot emphasis enough how horrible I look in it. It’s everything someone with my body type should avoid. If it were another friend’s wedding far away I might suck it up, but this will be full of our friends and family and everyone I know, the pictures will be all over my family’s house and everyone’s social media. I would be so uncomfortable, self conscious, and miserable the entire wedding.

c2gv1b	2019-06-19 13:06:01	kingexplos1onmurder	WIBTA- if I refuse to go to a wedding because I will have to wear a dress?	"A friend of my mother is getting married around September time and has invited my family. ( mum,dad, 2 brothers and me)

After I found out I was really skeptic on going since I really hate dresses. I tried asking my mum if there’s a possibility that I could wear something else and I mean literally anything other than a dress.  She said no and that when I go I will have to wear a dress. I wasn’t upset but I was severally disheartened.

The reason I hate dresses are because;
1. I feel very insecure and feel like people are judging me
2. I don’t like how they feel on my skin. They’re so uncomfortable and I feel like I can’t move
3. I just hate dresses in general. They make me look masculine and fat and I don’t like that.

My mum knows I hate dresses but is still wanting me to wear a dress. I’m thinking about refusing to go to the wedding because I will be so uncomfortable and potentially annoyed and I don’t want to ruin the wedding for anyone else

So... WIBTA if I refused to go to the wedding because I don’t like dresses?

EDIT: my mum and the friend are not that close. They barely talk but I can remember growing up with the friends kids until they moved away"	No A-holes here	0	0
c2gu80	2019-06-19 13:03:48	thiswaytomirkwood	WIBTA if I tell my friend that I’m sick of listening to his problems?	"I’ve been friends with Luke for 10 years. He’s a great guy, really - it’s just that for some reason he always falls for toxic women. The latest object of affection is this girl Denna. She’s a 9 in appearance and a 1 in personality, and Luke, bless his heart, somehow thinks that this makes her a perfect 10. 

Denna, like many Instagram ‘models’, plays the field. And Luke knows this. But he hangs around, replying to her every message, taking her out to dinner when she asks him to, going to her place when she tells him to even at 2 in the morning. I asked him why he keeps doing all that, he replied that he thinks their relationship might later blossom into something more. (More ‘what’, exactly, I have no idea.) I told him that he’s an idiot. He actually agreed. 

Of course, Luke is only human and he gets hurt. Every other day he messages me to vent about the way Denna treats him. He took her out for lunch, she barely talked to him and kept texting on her phone. They went to see a movie, she kept talking about the new guy at work who’s just so cute. She called him at 1am and ranted for 2 hours about how she hates her job without letting him get a word in. He talked about an upcoming salary increase and she told him that he isn’t a real man until he starts earning at least a quarter million a year.

I’ve told Luke a thousand times that Denna is another toxic woman and he should *really* evaluate what he gets by having her in his life (they haven’t even hooked up so sadly I can’t say he gets mind blowing sex that makes up for all of this shit). He has replied a thousand times that I’m right, she’s an insufferable twat, he’s tired of being treated like crap and he will stop talking to her and he has blocked her. I’m relieved for my friend and go to sleep. The next day, Denna has been unblocked and Luke has taken her out to dinner again. 

At this point I'm just tired of hearing how awful Denna is and then finding out a few hours later that my friend, a decent-looking, smart and funny guy who should have no problem getting a better girl, has gone back to her again anyway. 

I know that I should be there for Luke and listen to his problems and make him feel that there are people in the world who actually care about him (unlike Denna), but all I feel is annoyance at him for being a dumbass, who, as one redditor said in another thread, keeps waddling in sewage instead of swimming for shore. I really want to tell him to take his problems elsewhere. I simply have run out of fucks to give."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2gtw8	2019-06-19 13:02:55	RomneyDesu	AITA For getting on my roommate for cleaning up our shared bathroom?	"    So I moved into this apartment last fall and everyone living there rents the bedrooms separately, and the main living space is shared. There are also 1 bathroom per 2 bedrooms connected by doors. The person I share a bathroom with is Kyle and his girlfriend Shay. I like a clean bathroom and in general, I am a clean person.

    The last time I had an issue with Kyle was over him leaving old toilet paper rolls on the bathroom floor, next to the toilet. I will say, my approach with this issue was terrible. I came off pointed, accusatory, and shouldve tried to offer solutions, like buying a trash can (After all its just toilet paper rolls). I did not do this, but instead over a few months, I would mention the toilet paper rolls to him, most likely with a bad tone of voice. This issue has gotten progressively worse as Kyle refuses to accept any fault, blames me, and becomes defensive over his cleanliness.

Last night I took a shower, and one of Kyle and What's towels was smelling very bad. It stunk up the whole bathroom. I tried mentioning it to them casually, in the main living room, but instead they turned very defensive and it turned into an argument about how I should not mention issues in main living soaces. About how I'm mean, and use their little issues to try to highlight larger issues I have with then

Yes i think they are toxic. I have only mentioned toilet paper rolls and the smelly shower towel. I still need to work on my approach with them, but I dont know what to do. Im supposed to talk to Kyle later today and not sure what to say. Hopefully this is as unbiased as possible, but it probably isn't."	Not the A-hole	0	0

One of my friends responded that they would like to come, except that they don’t drive so I would need to come get them (2 hours one way) *and* take them home. 

My compromise was that their partner and I could meet at a halfway point instead. Now the concert (which is about 6 months away) “isn’t meant to be” and they’re not answering me at all.

Granted, my friend has severe anxiety and I’ve done a ton in the past to help accommodate that issue. My other friends are pretty split between “you know how that friend is, and you’ve done it before so why not now” and “thank god you set some boundaries”. Either way, I’m feeling pretty guilty right now.

c2gtls	2019-06-19 13:02:13	AxalonNemesis	AITA for not revealing the truth I realized about how my younger brother died to our Mother?	"Almost four years ago now, my brother called me at 1am or so after we had texted a bit because he was driving. We talked quite a bit and joked and just had a great conversation for about two and a half hours and hung up around 3:3-4:00am. 

Next thing I know, later that evening, mom called me and said that I need to come immediately and she found him dead when she went to bring him some food. 

This has hit her hard and I worked through everything I could with her. Took charge of the funeral and speaking, paid for most of it and also started donations to help pay everything else. 

For about a year or so previously he and I would record our phone conversations and do skits in person to work on a project together. Mom never knew of this. 

After he passed, I grabbed all of his electronics, backed them up and wiped them of things mom shouldn't see. His private photos and videos he and an ex made, writings where he was down....private stuff that I never even looked at and I put on am external and just set it aside. 

While in my therapy I got to talking about that night and it was like I was slapped with a brick. He went to go hit up his dealer for his normal bag of pot and they talked about doing heroine and he did some. 

Which showed up on the report as what contributed to his death but until this conversation I forgot he asked me to promise him that I wouldn't tell mom and I did promise him. We always assumed he got ahold of some bad stuff. 

After therapy, I brought up the recording and I was remembering correctly. It was great to hear his voice. I miss him so much.

Mom took his death really hard. She is just now starting to do better. I'm afraid that if I tell her it will hurt her all over again and I don't think any good will come from it. 

It's already bad. She created a new Facebook page to use solely as her's but the name is my brothers and it freaked myself and everyone else out when we seen it. But that is a different battle. I tried to talk to her about that and she broke down about how much she misses him and ignored the fact it was a gut punch every time she likes or replies with something. 


Anyhow...TL;DR

You get brother died a few years ago and during therapy I remembered our last conversation and he admitted to trying heroine for the first time. We always assumed he got ahold of something bad and I apparently stuffed it down with everything else while handling the funeral and everything else. It just came to light when I remembered it during therapy. I promised him not to tell her and I don't want to betray that and cause more hurt that will solve nothing."	No A-holes here	0	0
c2gtjz	2019-06-19 13:02:03	shoshy566	AITA for being upset that my mom is trying to pay me and my fiancé to read the Bible?	"Backstory: I’m currently 22 and live with my fiancé (also 22) in our own apartment. Both of us were raised Christian although we had very different experiences. Neither of us identify as Christians anymore and religion isn’t something that either of us really care about or enjoy talking about.

My mother on the other hand is a devout born again Christian and has a tendency to ask me really direct questions that I don’t enjoy talking to her about (example: in high school she used to ask me if I was a lesbian just out of the blue from time to time since I didn’t have a boyfriend). Well, a few years back this lead to her just asking me if I still believed in god to which I told her that I didn’t really know and that I didn’t want to discuss it further. She freaked out and started crying and has occasionally tried to convert me ever since.

Well, this weekend she came to visit me for my birthday. It was the first time I’ve seen her in about a year so I was pretty excited. When she got here everything was fine but on the second night of her stay she says she has a birthday present for me and then proceeds to hand me my old bible (which I told her she could keep multiple times). Then she tells me to open it. When I do, there are two $100 checks- one for myself and one for my fiancé. She told me that we each need to read the book of John and then we can cash the checks.

Now, I have nothing against any religion. I am a firm believer that people should be able to do or practice whatever they want as long as they are not harming others. But personally, I want nothing to do with this. I feel offended that she would bring that book into my home and then try to pay me and my fiancé to read it. But I also don’t know what to do with it. I can’t just throw it away so now I feel stuck with it. I still want the $200 so I’m also probably going to read it despite feeling like I’m going against my own beliefs by doing so. So Reddit, I’m not really sure where I stand with this. 

AITA for being upset with my mom for doing this? It seems petty to me when I read it back so I feel guilty being bothered by it. My fiancé was pretty excited at the possibility of an easy $100 but I’m upset about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2gt3q	2019-06-19 13:00:51	nopedontwant	AITA I called my mom out about not having kids.	"I am F(35). Since I was in high school I have always been very clear with friends and family that I do not want to have kids. I even divorced my ex because of it ( he thought I would change my mind after marriage). Now my younger brother (27) and his fiance are pregnant and my mom hasnt stopped with the comments. Saying things like ""I always though you would be pregnant first"" and ""you are running out of time"". She also says that I just havent meet the right guy yet and when I do I will want kids! This really makes me mad because I have meet the right guy we have been together for 5 years, he also does not want kids. 
     Well we found out my brother is having a girl (yay) and I am beyond excited, I am planning the baby shower and getting my own home ready to help and babysit on occasion. I am really looking forward to having a little friend! So my mom has taken this as a sign that I am confirming that I want kids and will not stop asking me about it, I finally got fed up and just kinda yelled at her that I am never having kids and to leave me alone about it (this was in private). She immediately started crying and said I was being ungrateful,mean and cold-hearted, so now I feel bad. Am I the asshole in this?

Update: Went to my moms last night to have a sit down talk (brought her some dinner too). I explained calmly again that I dont want kids and how it feels when she continually questions me about it. Mended the fence, hopefully it will stick this time.

Also I am 100% sure lying about not being able too will back fire as she would spend so much time researching fertility treatments. If I were to get sterilized with out telling her that would be even worse as she would want to know about it even if she didnt agree.

c2gpjd	2019-06-19 12:52:14	TodakaYasumi	WIBTA for invading my dad's phone to see if he's two-timing?	"To provide context of who I am and my basic backstory, here's a link to an earlier post in the same sub I submitted recently:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c1sqj6/aita_for_yelling_at_my_dad_to_shut_up_while_being/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

There is this woman I had been suspecting since New Year's Eve, she was the first to call my Dad and exactly when the fireworks were starting at me. Since then, I had been seeing Dad being more secretive than ever, hiding his phone from my mom and lesser conversations with my mom (she is very busy at work and frankly, her salary is as quadruple as dad's). 

He had been staring at his phone and replying to messages idk from whom at dinner time and smiling ever since. 

A month prior, while taking me along to grab a lunch with my auntie (dad's younger sister), dad and auntie was BMing mom and her family side, dad asked me to keep quiet from Mom of the meal, along with the conversations. 

Just a day earlier, Dad asked me to charge his phone (he leaves his charging cable at work and uses mine at home), I was plugging the phone when I saw a message from that same woman I suspected pop up on the phone screen, saying ""Are you (in a partially intimate pronoun I can't translate to English, not even close to honey) back home yet?"" 

What kind of woman who would message a married man asking if they had arrived home yet??? And so after a night of sobbing in bed and insomnia, I confronted my mom about this last night, she received the story calmly and told me ""You are good at tech things, so can I trust you to gather evidence from that man's (my mom resent dad so much for BMing her fam) phone?"" 

And so I said yes.

But now I'm feeling so guilty to do against my own code of respecting others' privacy, however, this kind of privacy, I cannot overlook.

c2go0b	2019-06-19 12:49:24		AITA for not being cool with my husband going o/s for a bucks party?	"As per title. 

Husband asked if I would be ok with him surprising his friend by coming to the bucks party. We are also invited to the wedding next year and one or both of us will attend.

It would be a 2week trip, around 25 hr+ flight each way. 

I said I wasn’t really ok with it, given a choice, and considering we’re attending the wedding, I thought this wasn’t as important given our circumstances. 

The circumstances being:

1. The bucks falls around our one year wedding anniversary, so he’d be away for it

2. we are currently going through IVF. All going well (fingers crossed) I’d be about 8-9 weeks by around this time (still very much a wait and hope it sticks timeframe) not counting chickens but finding it hard to plan anything this year, being full of unknowns.  On the other hand if it doesn’t go to plan, something goes south, I’ll be alone dealing with that while he is o/s. So yeah, it’s pretty selfish but that’s how I’m feeling Rn.

I wont and don’t want to ever stop him doing something that is important to him. Never have been that person. 

I feel I just answered honestly when asked how I’d feel, and think potentially because my answer wasn’t a resounding ‘yes’, and possibly made him feel crappy/guilty, Now I haven’t considered his feelings in all this and have upset him. Am I the bad guy?"	No A-holes here	1	0

It wasn't easy finding a job in our field of study. We ended up working in the same state but in different towns (3 hours away from each other). I drive to see her every weekend since she doesn't drive.

I've been at my current job for 4 months. She has been at her job for 3 months. The distance isn't ideal so I have been looking for a job that's closer to her. However, opportunities have been limited and I haven't been successful for the jobs I have applied to. 

Now she found a job opportunity in another state (which we will call B) and is considering applying. 

When she mentioned this, I was upset. We have a 6 month rental lease in the town she's working in. We bought furniture and were just settling in. I had been limiting my job search close to her.

State B a very small state (not the US) and considering that we are still considered fresh graduates, it will be very difficult for the both of us to relocate there. I would probably be jobless for awhile unless I remain where I am (I would have to take a plane if I wanted to visit her). And she would like me to move if she gets the job.

She says it's her dream job and she isn't too happy with her current one and I can understand. But at the same time, I feel slightly annoyed as well.

c2gley	2019-06-19 12:41:34	De4thsflame	AITA I blocked a friend because he asked for my help	"So a bit of backstory, I knew this guy from college, I was on a two year course and he was only there for the first year. He dropped out and, as I understand it, is now pursuing a career in music.

The reason I mention his career is because that was what he wanted help with, he messaged me after not being in contact for close to two years he messages saying he wants to use some prop guns I have. I know through mutual friends that he is into drugs (mainly weed) and I know through personal experience that he isn't very responsible.

Now these guns are a mix of black airsoft and deactivated revolvers that I got when my grandad passed away, and wouldnt be legal to take outside (I live in the UK). 

When he asked me I was so annoyed that I completely ignored his first message. He then messaged me again asking the same thing to which my response was to block him on all social medias.

Edit 1. Many people are commenting on how I should have said no, simply for the legal issue. A tad mor context for this, the course we were on was a public services course (mainly for police), and I would have thought it was common knowledge for anyone within the UK, especially if they are attempting to use them as props, that it us not legal to just walk around with weapons that could be mistaken as real."

c2gko7	2019-06-19 12:39:13	Zederikus	AITA for refusing to apologise for offending someone	"First a bit of background, I moved to the UK a few years back with family and went to sixth form (high school) there. 

Everything was pretty new for me, in my old country I’ve never even really seen a black person before, or encountered other cultures, other than maybe chinese. 

So what sort of happened was is that I went to shop for shirts as per our uniform and bought a bunch of shirts that were made in Pakistan. Never really had anything from there before so I was kind of hyped (I don’t understand it now).

Anyway a couple days later I started going and in the common room I got talking to this asian girl about where I was from and in turn asked her the same, and she said that she was “made in pakistan, haha”. I was still a bit stoked about my shirts and said “so were my shirts haha”. Then she asked me to repeat myself and explain why, I did slowly and carefully and she sort of threw a tantrum that I compared her to clothes that people are forced to make in sweatshops and how I reduced her culture to nothing but slaves making cheap shirts. 

Then she told her friends what I said and they demanded I apologise, but I refused since I thought what I said was fine. 

Then I found out someone she knew almost died from working in a sweatshop. After that I said I was sorry for what happened to her friend but still said that I was not racist to say “so was my shirt”. And her friends sort of made up all kinds of things about me like how I was racist or how I wanted to go out with her and she refused and then I allegedly said that she was as shit as a pakistani shirt. All kinds of things. (All of which are lies by the way.) 

After that I withdrew from six form drama to my little gang and forgot about the whole issue, but I still kind of think about whether it was petty of me not to just say sorry for being “racist” back then.

INFO: Many people mention this so I added this to the end. 

The reason I didn’t apologise for being racist (other than the fact that I don’t believe I was). Is because I thought that she would use my apology as and admission of guilt / proof to others and the teachers to prove that I was racist and I was really scared that I would get in trouble so early. I did say sorry for what happened to her friend, though, since I could lose nothing by saying that, but seeing how scheming she appeared before I didn’t think that she would be satisfied without me being punished by the teachers."

c2gk89	2019-06-19 12:37:30	Robatorobo	AITA for telling my friend to stop talking about her crush	"So this honestly happened a few years back maybe 5 or 6 years ago while I was in high school, but I keep thinking about it and wonder if what I told her was harsh or she overreacted.

So back in my freshman year of high school I met this girl in my gym class and she was pretty cool and fun person to be around. I would occasionally sit with her and her group of friends for lunch and we would just talk normal teen stuff, all that relationship stuff teen girls are always into and what not. Well beginning second semester she started to talk about a boy she new quite well and said that she wanted to date him and go out with him yada yada. At first it was cute how she’d crush over him and how excited she’d get and I was pretty happy for her. But then it becomes and ongoing thing of every conversation I had with her she’d bring up her crush. Every time at lunch she’d talk about him non-stop for the whole lunch period. Of course I did sit other places for a few days maybe she’d calm down after a bit, but no it was an on going thing for the rest of the month. One day I came back to sit with her and friends during lunch and at first It was nice to talk to her normal for once until she started up again with how she wants to date him and she loves him. I finally told her very annoyed to go talk to boy instead of gushing about him non-stop and see if he actually like her they way she did because they where pretty close friends. I also told her I was very tired of hearing her talk and complain how she wasn’t good enough when she didn’t even bother trying to talk to the boy. She seem to quite after that and then left after that to get lunch. Maybe a minute later this guy friend of hers who I did not no know, walks up to me yelling about how I hurt her feeling and how I was so rude. I not very good with confrontation so needless to say I was confused why this teen boy, who is much taller then me (I’m 5’2”) was yelling at me. I asked what the hell he was talking about and he told me that my friend said I yell at her and said she was ugly and that she would never get into a relationship with her crush and what not. I look at him a bit angry she’d not only lie but also sent a boy to deal with a small girl who apparently called her ugly. Luckily for me when I explain to him of what happened he calmed down and was reasonable about the whole situation and apologized for jumping to conclusions and maybe should have thought it out more before coming to yell at me but he still told me to apologize to her, which I refused cause at the moment I said nothing wrong. After the whole ordeal she stopped talking me and maybe once in a blue moon she say hi.

Now thinking back in it should I have just ignored her when she talk about her crush, cause it was none of my concern? Maybe I’m thinking to deep into it but it has always bother me that maybe I should have just been quite and let her go on about it but I’d like to know a third party opinion."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c2gk83	2019-06-19 12:37:28		AITA for criticizing my boyfriend's Twitch stream?	"Boyfriend is 31 I'm 24. We've been together 3 months.

So my boyfriend and I both work full time and my boyfriend also Twitch streams as a hobby. He is a small streamer but dreams of getting big one day and streaming full time. I support this because he genuinely is talented and hilarious. I'm not just saying that. For those who are less familiar with Twitch I would describe him as a guy that could honestly be a radio talk show host because that's just how his personality is and this kind of personality translates to video game commentary and shenanigans well. 

The thing is this guy *lives* in the dark. His room is lit with special colored lights, but as you can imagine, blue light bulbs coming from 2 lamps don't light a room well. Looks cool, but bad lighting. He's just used to it. I can hardly see what I'm doing in there when I visit and give him crap about it all the time in a joking way.  

His best friend also Twitch streams. It might be relevant that he happens to be a more successful streamer than him. One day we were watching his best friends stream together and I commented that I liked his camera set up.

Boyfriend immediately got jealous. He wasn't aggressive about it but I could tell I rustled up some feelings. He told me I never compliment his camera set up. I replied that I didn't mean it like that- I just think his best friends set up was really nice!

He asked me what was wrong with his. I told him nothing is wrong with his (lie-trying not to rock the boat when he's already offended). He pressed me.

I gave in and told him his stream camera is a bit too dark and I can't see him clearly. He told me that can't be true because he paid tons of money on an expensive HD webcam so that clarity wouldn't be a problem. 

He was a bit salty about it the rest of that night, but shook it off. I did too. He asked a question, he wanted the truth, so I gave my opinion. It's a hard conversation to have. 

A week or so passed. We were watching Twitch together again. He asked me if I thought cameras ever took away from the quality of people's content. I told him yes, that if there is not a good camera setup it's distracting and it's better to do without. Originally thinking it was just a general question, I cringed a bit realizing that I missed where the conversation was going and that he was talking about himself. 

He told me he watched back his streams and that he felt like he enjoyed watching his collabs with people on other channels where he can't see his face more than his own steams where be can see his face.

In my mind I'm like ""you can see your face?"".

Ok that was bad, I'm sorry. 

I commented again about the lighting issue saying that I just think his lighting is just a bit too dark and that his voice and speaking is what makes the content funny and his camera setup distracts from that.

He got quiet. He didn't like that I said that.

c2gk5j	2019-06-19 12:37:08	creeps16	AITA for dumping drink on someone and telling him to leave me alone	"

I’m 16 y.o boy. I used to smoke weed, I usually went to one guy’s house to buy it. Not an actual home, trap house. People used to hang out there, they all knew me. I was the only white guy who went there. They talked to me but there was one guy who used to sit there. One time he gave me lsd and that’s it. 

I stopped going there. But I still saw him around my school, which didn’t make sense because my school is in another part of town. He said hi to me few times.   Then I saw him at park, in front of my house.I was out with my friends and I saw him there too. It got to the point when I would see him every time I got out of school. He either said hi or waved at me, or just stared at me.


Yesterday I got out of school and was walking home, he called my name, I continued walking, he got closer, I didn’t realize how close he was so I turned around fast. I was holding bottle of coke, it slipped and spilled all over him. I told him to leave me alone and continue walking."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2gjbi	2019-06-19 12:34:16	Annabelhector	AITA for withholding my husband's wage so he doesn't buy fast food and get fatter and fatter?	"My husband and I are in our mid thirties, we've been married a year, together for 4ish and have a newborn son. I have another 15 year old son from a previous marriage. When we met he was overweight, but in a kind of cute/husky way. He overeats, a lot. We're now in obese territory and it's bothering me. A lot. 
I feel like I've exhausted all options: I cook healthy food, suggest we exercise together, etc. I'm a former ballet dancer and have ""skinny genes"", but of course, I watch what I eat and do yoga and dancing. 
After finding a mountain of fast food wrappers in his car and in the trash for the millionth time I announced that I was taking his wages. Here's some snippits from the conversation:

Him: How will I buy gas? Me: We'll fill up your tank together on Sundays
But what if I get hungry? I'll pack you more healthy lunches
I work really hard...I've earned that money. Yeah, man, think how much you'll save not buying 10 tacos every day.

.....

I pack his lunch every day, he gets takeout on the way to work and on the way home every single day. I love this guy, I don't want him to feel shit. I've been married before, my first husband died when he was 30 from brain cancer, he never got to see his son grow up, I don't want that to happen again. 
He's on some medication for bipolar disorder, he blames that for his weight gain. But I just don't buy that because he eats sooooooo much crap. He also has some self esteem issues as he is a cop but had to take on different duties after getting diagnosed with mental illness. This happened just before we met and I supported him, he's been stoked becoming a dad and getting married. 
He's American and I am Australian so we do have some mild cultural clashes. I haven't told him I'm finding him unattractive but I am. It's unhealthy and gross. 
He's not interested in our finances, I pay all our bills out of our accounts and run the household, I also work full time but am on maternity leave with pay till September.
Of course if he needs or wants anything that isn't food related I will buy it for him, I just feel I have to dish out some tough love here to help this drongo lose some weight.
AITA?


UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your advice. If it will help anyone sleep tonight I have handed myself over to the authorities and am writing this from prison. The hemlines on the uniform are all wrong for me but I'm just glad I'm off the streets.
I'm being deported tomorrow and I think Margot Robbie should play me in the biopic.


Jokes aside, I opened myself up for judgement on the world wide web and that's what I've got. I read all the comments and I appreciate everyone's views and personal experiences.

I ended up speaking to my husband a couple of hours ago and I'm feeling a whole lot better. He doesn't think I'm an asshole or an abuser and his opinion is the most important one. Xo"	Asshole	0	0

c2gbxl	2019-06-19 12:25:09		WIBTA for reporting my friends aunty to CPS?	"So time for some context, apologies for the super long post, my friend (MF) has an aunty (FA) who’s got a kid (FK) and she’s been telling me these stories of there family troubles, FK’s dad (FA’s) husband is suffering from alcoholism, he’s now recovering from what I hear and has managed to get his business back (starting again however still has many contacts) anyway in this time FA has been a total piece of shit. Has been constantly going out drinking and leaving FK to be taken care of by Alcoholic Dad (AD), while he was suffering he was unable to drive and couldn’t take FK to school. Fair play, he fucked up but now is recovering and getting his life on track.

Turns out FA hasn’t been taking FK to school and her two kids (they’re step kids to AD) haven’t been taking FK to school either (they’re both above 25 and drive and live off AD and FA))

It has gotten to the point FA has been reported by the school due to all the absences but what really pisses me off is the fact out of the 3 people who weren’t ill no one gave enough of a shit to take FK to school or even taken her out. 

I picked up MF and FK the other day and FK started telling me how she ate a cheese burger for breakfast that her mom made her (she’s 7). Important to note she said she only ate 1 that morning, which implies to me it’s often more. FA went out 3 nights drinking and left her car in the town she went out in.

At one point her kids were letting the dog shit in the house and not cleaning up while FA, FK and AD were on holidays it’s that bad. There’s so much more too.

FA and her kids and lazy shits who neglect the kid and AD is recovering and is busy with his business to take care of her. Now AD has a shit ton of money so FK is now spoiled as she literally gets anything she wants, MF won’t report to CPS as she feels like she’s betraying her family but the question is WIBTA for using what MF has told me in confidence to get the kid taken else where?

P.S they don’t hit her but they do shout at her for silly things unsure if CPS would even be better for the girl or not but I would hope FK goes to her grandmas or something"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2gbic	2019-06-19 12:24:08		AITA for telling my sister to grow up and be more independent?	"For context, I (25F) live a few states away from home, and my sister, Sarah (21F), lives at home while she finishes up college next year. 

Last night, around 10 PM, she messaged me complaining that it was raining but Mom and/or Dad wouldn’t come pick her up from work and she didn’t want to drive home. Some important info: 1.) She works maybe 2 miles from home. 2.) Both of my parents get up at 4:30 AM for work, so she woke them up when she called. 3.) Sarah and my mom share a car, so had they picked her up, my mom would have had to figure out how to get her car for work this morning. 

In short, I told Sarah she was acting ridiculous and needed to grow up and just drive herself home, that it was absurd what she was expecting of them. She accused me of holding her to a standard of independence that was too high, “force-feeding” her the idea that if she didn’t live her life the same way I live mine then she’s in the wrong, and to stop talking to her about it. 

I asked her what her plan was for next year when she didn’t live at home and needed to get home after work in the rain. She snapped and told me she didn’t need to have an answer to that question, but she was sick of me being “too abrasive” and telling her to be more independent.

This isn’t the first time we’ve gotten into it over this. Last week, she messaged me complaining that our mom didn’t go to the store, therefore she had no bread to make a sandwich. I just told her to go buy a loaf of bread, and she flew off the handle at me telling me that “Mom knew I needed bread to make my lunch and she still didn’t go to the store. I can’t depend on anyone.” Sarah had a car and money, there was no reason why she couldn’t run to the store, but she just ranted that it was my mom’s job to make sure she had food. We argued in circles, but I just gave up because there was no getting through. 

The problem is I know Sarah suffers from anxiety/depression (for which she’s being treated). Usually when she gets into arguments like these, at some point she ends up saying she’s going to have a panic attack, she feels attacked, and we’re having an adverse effect on her mental health. My parents definitely walk on egg shells around her because they don’t want to upset her/feel responsible for negatively impacting her mental health, but I also don’t think it’s healthy for an adult who’s planning to move out next year not to accept basic responsibility for every day things and act so demanding of the people around her. 

I guess I just feel like an asshole because maybe I was too abrasive and not respectful of her mental health by telling her on multiple occasions to grow up and handle some things herself. Maybe I shouldn’t keep forcing the issue when I know it just upsets her. The last thing I want to do is make things worse. But at the same time, I feel like our upbringings by the same parents have been drastically different and I was expected to handle a lot of responsibility from a very young age."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c2g8wp	2019-06-19 12:17:48	cocobunaware	AITA for getting the police involved ?	"AITA 

My friend had split with his ex and I split with mine not long after, so I said rather than him living at his mums why not live with me and just pay me $50 a week. So he moved in with me and occasionally it’d be an issue getting the money on time but it was always paid in the end. 

When he lived with me he brought his Xbox and I wanted to play online but he never did so I set up the Xbox live in my name and with my bank details, fair enough. After a year roughly he moved out and I never thought anything of it, never received any charges from Xbox/Microsoft so wasn’t an issue. 

Around 7 months after he moved out I got my own Xbox and got Xbox live and game pass installed and the payments came out of the same bank account. After about 4/5 months of having game pass I realised how little I used it and deleted it, but then I noticed I got charged for it a month later via direct debit ! This was after receiving a refund of $1 from game pass bcoz my pass still had time to run until that months subscription ran out after I cancelled my account. 

Anyway, after I was charged again I looked back and realised I was paying 2x per month for both my game pass and Xbox live ! This had been going on for close to 4 months this and totalled around $55. 

Obviously I contacted Microsoft and asked wtf was going on, they told me my account (let’s call it account A) had an Xbox live subscription and the game pass had been cancelled, but his account (account B) had both and was set up using my bank details ! I queried how and when etc but bcoz I didn’t have password to his account I couldn’t access the details. 

So I was $55 out of pocket and it was clear it wasn’t from when he lived with me as account B hadn’t been in use and my card hadn’t been charged for 6 months after he moved out. I contacted him and explained the situation to which he denied all knowledge, baring in mind Xbox confirmed it was his account that was using my card, and the fact I never set up game pass when I was using account B whilst he lived with me I didn’t trust/believe him. 

After trying to get him to let me access his Xbox or know his password or even just meet and talk and him refusing any kind of assistance I contacted the bank and police and it’s now being investigated as a fraud case. 

For some reference it wasn’t just a minor acquaintance, we’d been really good friends for a decade plus. But whilst he lived with me there were a few events that made me loose trust in him and I found myself having to give him the benefit of the doubt far too frequently.

It’s been a few months now and we talked a little bit (but never talked about dating/what happened to us)
As time went on she kept sending me more photos of her. At first she would take selfies with pets and send them to me which I didn’t have a problem with at first. But that kinda evolved into her just sending me selfies. Nothing sexual. Just selfies.

So I told her I was uncomfortable with this. I said I am glad we are talking again (a lie but I didn’t want to be too mean) but that I was uncomfortable with what she is doing. And that is 100% true. It kinda made me feel like I was “the other guy” so I wanted to put a end to it. And obviously part of me was just being petty giving the situation... but I truly was uncomfortable.

Well after this she doubled downed and sent me screenshots of other guys (that she wasn’t dating) she sent the same selfies to saying “they don’t mind”. So I explained to her how I am uncomfortable because I know she has a bf, and she is my ex. And I said straighfup “I think it looks bad when you send selfies to your ex bf” (and yes she is dating the guy she cheated on me with if that means anything)

Now I admit there was probably a million different ways I could have handled it, but I wanted to be straightforward and put a end to the behaviour quickly. But AMIA because of it?

Also besides being uncomfortable I really just didn’t want to see the pictures... I mean that’s fair right?

Edit: I thought I should address this as well.
We dated for a long time. We got pets together and lots of mutual friends. It isn’t always easy as “just block her”
I can insure everyone that there is 0 intentions of me getting back together after what happened.

Update for anyone who see’s this. I took everyone’s advice and completely cut all ties with her. And I want to thank the people who were telling me to do that because it was very unhealthy behaviour on my part and I didn’t really think anything of it until reading the comments.

c2g1et	2019-06-19 11:52:08	Commandocoki	AITA for not accepting a PS4 from my so?	"
Background first. My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years. We have a 3&5 year old. We live an hour apart. I take care of the kids solo basically. He works 2 days a week stocking and generally brings me $30-$50 on a good week...but for many weeks now he hasn't given me anything. He recently quit cigarettes for vaping and it appears that vaping(and getting nug fronts) and the expensive gaming rig he built and has to pay off is draining the funds before he even gets his paycheck.

Now for the question. Yesterday he sent me a text  with a picture saying he brought me a PS4 for $120 and happy birthday. My birthday was in May and I never said anything about wanting a console (I had actually just spent several months saving up  for a gaming PC so in my very tiny amount of off time I could do something i enjoy, but I also homeschool so I rely heavily on the PC for schooling needs as well so that was worth it) and my response was ""I will never touch it.""
He got really upset and said that I'm always going on about wanting a PS4 (I've actually said I will never play a console again because pc is all I need) and that I switched up on him and he can never get it right.
I feel bad, but rejected his gift. Letting him know that things like school supplies, and things for the kids is what we need.

I was in the Army in a combat arms job and recently finished my enlistment. I've been around a lot of people who had severe PTSD from multiple deployments some of which who were with Ranger Battalion and Special Forces. The problem I have with this guy is that he is never on time. Yesterday he said he couldn't wake up which is why he was 5 hours late to work with the same story on Monday when he was 3 hours late to work. He recently took multiple weeks of on short term disability for PTSD. The company I work for is extremely generous and we get 4 weeks of leave a year which are all paid. In less than 6 months he has used all four weeks plus the 9 weeks of disability. I understand PTSD is a terrible condition and as I said I've had close friends and acquaintances deal with this but they were always on time and the utmost professionals. Since he is absent so much we have to pick up slack for him. Shouldn't there be some repercussions for the habitual tardiness and absents?	Asshole	0	0
c2g0k1	2019-06-19 11:48:33	Schtooker	AITA for not inviting a friend to play Dungeons and Dragons?	"As per the title, this revolves around a friend and the game/hobby that I love so much, DnD.

&#x200B;

On the friend. He is an old friend and our relationship used to be extremely tight-knit, but due to life, it is not what it used to be. We made the same friends in high school and they are the same group now in our early/mid 20's. I rent a place with these friends and we all got into DnD at the same time.

&#x200B;

We invited along him to play a couple of times (maybe 5 times) and the interaction at the table between him and I was always the same, identical to our relationship away from the table. He would talk over me and leave me feeling anxious and upset. So when I started hosting my ""group"" I got some of our old friends that I live with and a couple of new friends into it, a group of people I knew would all get along. I dropped a fair bit of $ into supplies and we got started. The first session went amazing, one of the best times playing I've ever had. However, the friend found out we were playing and showed up to my house on the second session with one of our old friends to play. I said, ok, but please take it seriously and we have to listen to each other. Neither of these things happened and it ended early after an extremely stressful session that almost made me quit that campaign there and then.

&#x200B;

The next day I sent him a message saying that we can't play together whilst I'm hosting, and he is more than welcome to join in any other games going on at home. I was polite as I could be and said essentially our relationship gets in the way of it. It is a game that requires the host and the player to be able to communicate without an argument being on the verge of happening. I thought that it was settled. But unfortunately not. A massive argument happened sparked by him showing up to my house uninvited before we were playing where he was outright hostile to me because he felt left out. He messaged our friend/s that we play with that he was upset due to this and this caused a close friend to pull out of the game as they didn't want to be caught in the middle. Another argument happened between him and I because I am genuinely confused about why this is happening. I am only excluding him, which I feel bad about doing, because of our relationship issues that make the game unable to be played.

&#x200B;

Tonight's session was called off by me because I was heartbroken that it had come to this. Now I honestly don't think I'll continue playing with my friends anymore because the amount of strife every time we have played recently is just too much, but it is crushing me and I am genuinely confused about whether I was ok to keep him excluded.

c2fzi9	2019-06-19 11:44:09		AITA for accepting my dad’s money even though I secretly think he is a bar person?	"Disclaimer: mobile etc, NOT a humblebrag

So my dad grew up in post-war Europe without his mom and physically (and emotionally) removed from his dad. I don’t think he really had the chance to mature properly, so the behaviour he displays now is not a 100% his fault, but still problematic imho. Even though (or maybe because) he isn’t the most easy to get along with, he had an amazing career and made $$$. 

Now today my dad is emotionally abusive, telling us (my mom, my brother and me) that we’re the reason for his depression, projecting all his issues on us and has zero ability to self-reflect. He’s also an alcoholic. 

However, he is amazingly supportive of my education, emotionally and financially. I decided to study overseas and have a partial scholarship, but the rest of the money comes from my dad. While I love my university and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity, I am growing increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. I feel bad taking that money, when I don’t know how to deal with my dad. However, i don’t show him that i have issues with him, as I know he wouldn’t be able to cope. I try to be nice to my dad, hug him and thank him often, but I do it because I know he wants it and I don’t wanna cause a fight, not because I genuinely want to. I also try to avoid him when home (tbh going overseas was my way of escaping this toxic situation). 

I am a very good student and have always been ambitious. I am preparing to enter a v e r y cutthroat and competitive field and I know that it would be way harder without the financial support of my dad.  He is also very proud of me and brags about me. 

The way I see it, it would be stupid to jeopardize my future because I feel guilty. I treat my dad right and he will never know about my troubles, as there is no way I will ever go NC as my mom is attached to him and I love my mom. 

So AITA for accepting money from my dad?

c2fz45	2019-06-19 11:42:28	SilverRoll6	AITA for being rude to my christian flatmate and his pastor?	"Hey guys

Month ago I (26M) moved into a place and shortly after the landlord moved in a flatmate (32M). he's christian which is like whatever but he keeps talking about god/jesus all the time. Not stuff like saying god bless you or whatever but for example when i was in the kitchen he asked what i think happens when I die. I know christians well enough to know that he was going to spring into evangelism with thatquestion so I said i wasn't interested in discussing and put my headphones back in and ignored him.

He has a little shrine thing set up in the living area. I don't care as i have my own things set up (tv, switch, xbone) but if he's in there praying he says I have to wait. I did at first but it got really annoying only being able to use the living room on his schedule (he takes like an hour sometimes? wtf lol) so I recently informed him that I will be using the living room whenever I want and he can pray if he wants but my gaming/netflix time will not be interfered with just because he wants to pray and that he should just move his shrine in his room if it bothers him

Speaking of netflix the other day I had my bf (24M) over and we startedwatching Sabrina. Kind of a goofy show and we're not crazy abt it but we liked it enough to keep watching. Flatmate came in and sat on the couch next to us and took it upon himself to inform us that watching occult stuff like sabrina invites demons into the home. We kinda laughed it off bc we thought he was joking but he was serious. Kept telling us to turn it off and it got annoying so we said that he could sit with us and watch quietly if he wanted to but if he was going to keep talking about that to find someone who cares. He called us assholes and said we should respect his faith but left after we kept shutting him down.

The craziest thing is that yesterday he invited his pastor round and ambushed me while i was in the kitchen. Pastor kept going on about how i should go to his church. I tried being polite at first but he kept yammering about jesus so i firmly but politely instructed him to leave. He didn't saying that i NEED to listen to him and agree to go to his church before he left so i just snapped and told him to fuck off and called him a doddering old cunt. He was pretty shocked and left after that

Feel kinda bad but honestly dunno how to deal with this lunatic. I called the landlord and left a message asking if we can discuss the other flatmate behavior. Maybe i can get him kicked out and get a better flatmate idk"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2fxpn	2019-06-19 11:36:52	ValuableTrade	AITA for refusing to shave my body hair?	"Before you get disgusted, please hear me out.

I am a 17 year old woman and due to personal reasons I don't shave my body hair. Well, most of it - I shave my legs during the summer because I'm not comfortable enough to go out unshaven yet.

My mom does not like it. She keeps sending me judging glares and comments about it, and it makes standing by my decision really tough. But I try to not get sad because of her.

She's really insistent though... She calls me dirty, sweaty, says I'm bringing her shame in front of other people. To be honest, I don't really get what all the fuss is about? It's just hair. I have it on my head, my arms, and the rest of my body. I shower daily and use deodorant, so I'm not any more sweaty or dirty than she is.

I tried explaining my reasons to her - that shaving is unnecessary, it's inconvienient, expensive, that it creates micro cuts on my skin and can lead to ingrown hair and infections. She mocked my last argument by bringing up something painful from my past, but I'd rather not discuss it. It hurt, but I didn't say anything.

c2fw9x	2019-06-19 11:31:26		AITA for memorializing a FaceBook of a former employee that I fired - and friend - over Ray*Ban sunglasses?	"In my early twenties, I hired an underling at a marketing company I worked for. She had both physical and mental health issues, but she was incredibly sweet. Just a kind, solid soul that had been dealt a poor lot in life.

She didn't last long at the company, but never harboured any ill will towards me - she had the attitude of, ""I tried, and I failed, and that's okay."" She had such a tenacious spirit. We became FaceBook friends and I would check up on her occasionally.

Ultimately, I left the company to have a child and had was a rough pregnancy. I started neglecting my friendships in favor of my health. When I went to invite her to my baby shower, I found out she had passed away just a few months prior.

This was in 2012.

So imagine my distaste when I received a notification that ""Friend tagged you and 40 others in a post"". I just became more upset when I saw that it was an *advert for Ray Ban sunglasses*. First, I messaged Ray Ban. They say it's a common scam website that they're not affiliated with.

So I contacted FaceBook with her obituary and other information.

I *thought* I had done the right thing, up until I told another friend who told me that it wasn't my place to memorialize the account, it should have been left to her family or at least a *close* friend, not her old supervisor who fired her.

She said that her class friends and family probably hadn't memorialized it for a reason, and I might have ruined something nice for someone. But people can still post on her wall, the scam website just can't post as *her* anymore. And even if we weren't terribly close, it still hurt to see, ""Friend posted a picture with you!""

First of all I'd need to let you know that my GF parents are stict, and in our religion, it is not permitted to meet, etc.. without at least getting engaged, after getting caught, I immediately received a call from my GF's mom telling me to meet her right now, so I took a cab all the way to their home, when I entered their house, she wanted me to explain the situation, I tried to avoid it, but I eventually had to tell her that I love her daughter, she loves me back. She then started making demands. She said she will agree on the engagement if I am able to pay her daughters college fees, pay for a home, pay for her food and necessities. I explained that it is only an engagement, she said regardless, once she is engaged to you, you will pay for everything, not us. we will take our hands off her.

I told her I'll be able to do all of that, except college. She then had a change of voice tone, asked me to handle it or talk to my mom or dad to help me with that. my dad's unemployed because of his employer running away, so he is retired right now. and I am paying for my own college fees, I work full-time, and i'm a full time student as well, I don't make much, but it's enough for a home, with necessities, and food, and i'd have some left.

c2ft8w	2019-06-19 11:20:51	Hamtoast	AITA for abandoning my coworker in the emergency room?	"Normally there’s more than two people on duty at my department at work, but on this specific day only myself (M32) and my coworker (F50) are working. Due to the nature of our work, it’s important that at least one person is available in the office during working hours. I’m working at the office when I get a call from my coworker that is out in the field on an assignment. She tells me that she’d fallen, landed on her wrist and need me to come pick her and the company car up. No problem, she’s not far away and it’s lunch time any minute so there’s time. When I get there I’m told by a nurse that her wrist needs to be x-rayed. The nearest hospital is in the neighboring town, and my coworker asks me to drive her there. Alright, there’s still time on my lunch break and we live in a country with free healthcare. Everything will be fine.

We stop by at the office so I can grab her personal items along with her computer, and we head on a 20 minute road trip to the hospital emergency room. On the way I ask her to call her friends or family to arrange transport home. She tries some friends and after unsuccessfully yelling at her father on the phone she doesn’t have much luck.

We arrive and I get her things out of the trunk and this is when she notices that I accidently grabbed her work laptop instead of her personal laptop (she described it as the computer in the black case, which there apparently were two). She demands that I head back to the office and grab her personal computer which I decline. She calls me selfish and unsympathetic. I won’t lie, I’m not particularly fond of this coworker but I treat her with the same respect as my other coworkers to keep the peace. At this point I’m tired of this and tell her that I’m heading back to the office.

It was like turning on a switch. She went from angry and annoyed to puppy eyes and sobbing in an instant. She asks me if I’m not coming inside to wait with her in the emergency room, to which I tell her that she’s at the hospital, she’s an adult and that I need to get back to the office.

She shoots me a long angry look and puffs away into the hospital. So I head back and I really thought that would be the end of it, but a few days later I get a call from my coworker on my personal phone. She tells me that her wrist is broken and that she had to wait alone in the hospital for 4 hours before she could go home. She tells me that she feels hurt that I left her there. By this point I’m pretty angry with her and I tell her straight that I’m sorry that she got hurt, but that we are coworkers. I am friendly, but I am not her friend. I am employed to do my job, not to be her moral support. She hangs up on me. Because of the injury my coworker was away for about two weeks and has not said many words to me since.

I am not ashamed of how I handled the situation, but I’ve gotten reactions from both sides. Some friends agreed with my actions and some of my friends tell me that I should’ve stayed and kept her company. So AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2fsr5	2019-06-19 11:19:16	Gaby_cheese	WIBTA if I didn't go to school tomorrow?	"I'll try to keep this as short and as simple as I can.

Basically, this week in my school is project week. A month before we had to choose which project we wanted to do from a huge list, and I chose to work in the wood-workshop.

This monday I go to the workshop and I see, that I am the only girl in there, everyone else are boys year younger than me and one older guy.

Our task is to make this human height wooden statue. This monday was a very bad day, because it was raining often and we couldn't work outside, because the wood had to be dry. Most of the boys went home to wait out the rain, while this other guy and I went outside, made a roof out of a big thin piece of wood and went to work. We worked for maybe an hour, and then the other guys came back stood around. The teacher came over and told everyone to go home.

Tuesday - we had to smooth out the wood pieces. At first, many kids were working, but in the end the same guy and me were left and had to finish smoothing out the wood ourselves.

Today - cutting cardboard and glueing day. We had to cut up cardboard and glue it with the wood. We all cut up the cardboard, but I was left to glue the pieces together alone. The teacher came over and helped me to glue the piece. Then he told me to go to the classroom, where this other teacher brought us ice cream. Then we had to go back and finish glueing the pieces (8 of them, I think. We had 3 somewhat done). I go there, and all the guys are sitting with their phones in front of them. I say: let's get to work, move these pieces somewhere else and finish glueing the rest.

The guys repeated my words (like todlers would) and didn't do anything. One guy started vaping inside. I absolutely hate all smoke, so I left. I told the teacher, that I had to go and called my mom to pick me up.

The statue is nowhere near done and we have to present it this friday. It feels like I am doing most of the work. I don't want to go there tomorrow, mostly because I have to get up early and have someone to drive me there. Working while 5 other are just standing around doing nothing is annoying, so I thought to just let them do the work.

We're all just graduating high school, I've been with my boyfriend sense the middle of freshman year, and I've been loose friends with Keven. Not close, but I would have considered him a friend at some point. 

This relationship from all I've seen in the less then half a year has distanced him from all of his friends, she's even right in front of me told him he needs to tell her when he goes out with friends. She is with him every day. Once my bf tried to make plans and Keven said he had to check if SHE wanted to do anything that day. She also gives him post warning about doing things, piercing her nose, smoking weed, etc, which is neither here nor there because she can do what ever she wants with her body, and he shouldn't tell her she can't, but still, I think he should know what his girlfriend is doing with her body. He will not tell her no, because he's TERRIFIED of losing her. Lastly, from what I've seen he seemed to get kinda drained by her. 

She expects everything. This isn't to say she's a terrible person, just that the relationship they've built seems to me to be one sided.

They've (less then a half a year in, I'd like to remind) gotten engaged. I'm not exactly close to him, but I've seen no one with the balls to tell him how big of a mistake he's making. I don't know if I should leave it up to people closer in his life, or out and tell him myself.

Tl;Dr guys making a huge mistake, should I, being someone who's not close tell him?

c2fnnl	2019-06-19 11:02:45	gambill1998	AITA for practicing guitar at night	"I am currently a college student and as such, I have a roommate. During the last semester, we both lived in a large house with a few other roommates and at this house, I never had problems practicing guitar (using my hollowbody without plugging in) at night. 

For the summer, lease ended at the previous house and me and one of my roommates (lets call him Sam) moved into another house for the summer. Currently, it is just me and him at this new house. The house is about half the size of the previous house and the walls are really thin. Over the past few weeks, as I have attempted to practice at night, he has let me know that it is too loud for me to practice guitar using my hollowbody at night. This is fine with me because he obviously has the right to sleep at a reasonable time at night. Since then I have practiced guitar and bass by playing my solid body guitar and bass without plugging in at night. I haven't heard any issues since I made the switch until tonight. I have insomnia and often have a hard time sleeping. I work a day job during the day so I cannot practice during the day very long or very easily. In addition to this, I make a significant portion of my income by playing gigs, so practice is important. I am often most productive at night due to these factors. 

Tonight, around 3:00 in the morning, he sent an angry text to me telling me ""I need to stop keeping him up so goddamn early"". After this text, he got out of his bed, came into the living room (where I was practicing) and told me I should be aware of how much noise I am making and I need to practice earlier in the day. 

I agree that he should be able to sleep at night without concern. The problem is I was not made aware of how much noise I was making, I was practicing in a room non-adjacent to his in order to minimize noise, and in addition to this, I am playing a solid body instrument without plugging in (so it shouldn't be loud). I do not fault him for being angry in his text since he was trying to sleep. In every other regard, we get along well, and we only are roomming together for the rest of the summer. AITA for practicing at night?

Edit #1  I realize this might not have been clear in the original post so I want to make sure it is clear. I was only told once before tonight I was being loud (when I played the hollow body). After that, the next day, I had him stand in his room while I played my solid body guitar without plugging in. At that time, he said that he could not hear it, so I made the assumption that my solid body guitar would be quiet enough not to be an issue

Edit #2  After reading the comments and having some conversations with you all I realized I am the Asshole. I just got talking to him and we reached an agreement about what hours I can practice inside the house and when I need to go somewhere else to practice. We also agreed that he can yell at me or text me anytime I am being too loud so that way, I don't continue to make noise at a weird time for whatever reason, whether intentional or not.

"I'm currently finishing middle school, and because next year is highschool for me, all of the students randomly go to new classes, with an exeception of at least 1-2 friends out of a 4 student list that every student has made this year. I have this friend in my class, who used to be one of my greatest friends up until less than a year ago, but since then we began talking less and less. His behaviour changed, and he became quite a troublemaker, with a new habit of hitting everything in his path, his friends (AKA me and some other people) included. 
While I was okay with this for quite some time, around the end of year I decided that I won't put up with this next year. So when we got our lists, I didn't write him, and when he asked me if I did, I lied, thinking if I'll tell him now he'll just hit me more and make fun of me.
I tried to talk to him about stopping his behaviour before but for the most part he didn't listen, so unless he at least drops his habit of hitting me and the rest of his friends when we're not in the mood for it, I'll be more than happy to not be in the same class with him next year.

c2fhjb	2019-06-19 10:41:53	Hoodrat31399	AITA for taking my 18yo sister to a concert after my parents told her no.	"I’m on mobile so please bare with me.

So last night there was a post Malone concert in my city and one of my sisters friends was selling a last minute ticket for a lot cheaper than the standard rate. She wanted to go and since she wrote her last exam yesterday and didn’t have any important commitments today she figured it would be alright.
 I was sitting in my room when I heard her and my mom arguing.

Sis: I’d really like to go to the post concert tonight

Mom: No, I don’t know the friends you’re going with and also I said so.

Then I stepped in and had a brief argument with my mom saying that she should be allowed to go because she’s 18, has no obligations the following day and you not knowing her friends and because you said so aren’t valid reasons to give to a young adult.

at this point my sister had gone back to her room and I figured she was over it already, but then my younger sister beckoned me into other sisters room where she was busy putting on makeup and told me she was going anyway. now I didn’t have a problem with taking her as my sister can legally (in my country it’s age 18 not 21) make these decisions for herself and I didn’t think my mother was being reasonable and fair so i told her my friends (they we’re coming over shortly) and I would take her in my friends car so that we wouldn’t use my dad car which he has given me the keys for. We took her and me and my friend made sure she got into the venue safely.

When we got back to my house my mother and father came and spoke to us telling me and my friend how disrespectful it was that we went against their wishes of her going out and I told them once again that they are being unreasonable and that if she was underage, had an exam in the near future, had obligations early in the morning or she wasn’t going to a huge concert that I wouldn’t have taken her. After saying that my dad said “I’ll show you unreasonable, get your friends out of my house and give me your car keys (keep in mind we didn’t even use my car).

Anyway we packed up and left and basically drove around the suburbs talking about it until we had to fetch my sister at 12.

TLDR: took my 18 year old sister to a concert after my parents said no even though she had no exams and no obligations the next day, now my parents are angry at me for undermining their (unjustifiable) decision for her to stay at home even though she’s of legal age to make the decision for herself.

Edit: my friends and I asked her multiple times if she was sure she wanted to throw away her whole school vacation for this one night and she was adamant that she was fine with it, so keeping to my beliefs of she’s 18 she can make her own decisions, we took her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So a little backstory, ive known this friend who i’ll call Jack for now. I met Jack in 6th grade until now (10th grade) and have been nice friends with him, playing games and talking to him like ive known him since childhood. He recently started picking on this autistic kid at school who has no friends and picks stuff out of the bin to eat. Whenever Jack sees this he immediately grabs the nearest piece of food on the floor and throws it in the bin hoping the autistic kid grabs it out and eats it. I told him straight away to never do that again and how much of a POS this made him look like but he came back at me saying “its not gonna hurt him, the guy cant even speak”. I immediately got pissed off and just didn’t speak to him for the rest of the day and the next to months (Today).  A month after i told him off he was messaging me asking why i wasn’t talking to him anymore and seemed to be mad at him. I told him its because he’s teasing that kid and not stopping when i confronted him about it and to never talk to me again unless i see him apologise to that kid.

c2fh1s	2019-06-19 10:40:08	Trash_Panda96	AITA for being passive aggressive with my guy friend	"So I ended up taking Plan B about 2 weeks ago and I already knew what was coming to me. Today I ended up starting my period and the whole day my mood was swinging, but I didn't find an outlet for it. So the whole combination of EC and perioding going on at the same time was already asking for a bad time.
When I went to hang out with my guy friend, I was fine the first half into our hang out, but then I started getting snippy with him here and there. He knew I was both on my period and on Plan B so he brushed it off like it was nothing. I started hanging out with him for a little over year and I know him to be more left brained. 
The trouble happened was after we watched a pretty dumb movie, but that was enough to make me start crying out of no where. He asked why I was crying and said that I didn't know and he started laughing at me, which made me cry even more. I told him to stop and I was being serious (maybe he couldn't tell because I was likely incoherently sobbing) and when he wouldn't I distanced myself from him, but he started hugging me again, while still laughing. I had enough of it until I went into the bathroom and locked myself in until he came to check in on me 5 or 10 minutes later. Really it was for him to go to the restroom. 
After I stopped sobbing I went back into the room and I asked him why he was laughing at me. He said, ""Because it was funny"". The way that he pictured me crying was, as he explained it, a girl sobbing over a sit com while scooping ice cream into her mouth (no, there was not ice cream involved and the movie wasn't a sitcom). I'm normally not passive aggressive but after that I became that the rest of the night. Am I the asshole for being getting hormonal with my friend? 

TL;DR: I'm on my period and on Plan B so my hormones got me feeling salty and emotional af and took it out on my friend because he laughed at me for crying out of no where.

Edit: I was pretty aware I was going to be labeled an asshole for the behaviour, but I also wanted some feedback on here since I know being passive aggressive is about as bad as being aggressive since I'm not communicating what I'm feeling in a proper manner. I talked about it with my friend and apologized for it. He was understanding about it which I'm thankful for. Thanks again everyone for your feedback. I can't control what I'm feeling during those days, but I can control my actions."	Asshole	0	0

My friend = Tom

A little background for context:

So I was invited to my friend Tom's party back in February when he and Jess were still together (they had been in a relationship for about a year at that point). At this party I met a girl who I rather fancied (Caitlyn) so I got her Snapchat and that was that. Me and Caitlyn didn't really talk much after that because I was pretty busy with work at the time and so was she so things never really escalated. 

Fast forward to April Tom told me he and Jess had broken up due to both of them realising that they were in a toxic relationship. All is still fine.

Now a few weeks ago Caitlyn and I started talking again and things seem to be going well. The only thing I'm concerned about is that Caitlyn is bestfriends with Jess so it feels a bit wierd especially because I haven't spoken to Jess since her and tom broke up. I feel like of I went further with Caitlyn I would be impeding on some sort of ""bro code"" or something like that so,

c2fd9o	2019-06-19 10:27:30	CatShelterVolunteer	AITA for taking an extra (evening) shift at the cat shelter?	"Hi, this is a throwaway just so you know. Anyway, I (16F) live with my dad, and I volunteer at a cat shelter in my free time. I’m sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes, I’m not a native english speaker. TL;DR at the bottom. Also this is shortened since my first post was over the character limit so if there’s anymore info you need just let me know and I’ll answer.

I am scheduled to work at the cat shelter thursdays every other week, however I can take extra shifts if I want. Two days ago, late in the evening, I got an email that said extra volounteers were needed in the evening the following day (i.e. Tuesday). Since I had nothing to do that day/evening I decided to take the shift since literally no one had volunteered to do so yet and obviously someone needs to take care of the cats (and cuddle them!).

When I was on the tube to the cat shelter the next day I called my dad to let him know where I was going but he didn’t answer, so I sent him a text instead.

Most of the cats at the shelter come from less than stellar situations so they’re kind of shy and jumpy. Because of that we’re not allowed to have our phones with us during our shifts (unless we’re waiting for an important phone call/emergencies) because the ring tone can scare the cats, so as usual I left my phone on silent in a locker when I got to the shelter.

When I was done with my shift I changed into my normal clothes and got my bag with my phone from the locker I put it in and went to the bus stop to wait for the bus. My shift ends at 20:30 so it was about 21:00 at the time, when I was walking to the bus I got my phone from my bag because I was going to listen to music, and I noticed that I had a few missed calls from my dad, so I tried calling him but he didn’t answer.

Eventually I got home (at 22:00) and dad was there, I asked him what we were having for dinner or if they had eaten already. However my dad was apparently very angry and shouted at me for going somewhere without telling him and being out so late at night, and he asked where I had been.

I told him I had both called AND texted him and that if he was paying attention to his phone when he’s with his girlfriend (they’re not really doing anything special but just enjoying each other’s company I guess) he would have known that I was at the cat shelter.

Some more things were said and both of us were angry and none apologized, I went to my room and didn’t talk to anyone for the rest of the night. Now I feel kind of bad because he got worried, but I still think he should pay more attention to his phone and answer it when someone calls.

c2fb2j	2019-06-19 10:19:43	MrBedee	WIBTA if I refuse my sister a plus one for my wedding	"
Hi,

On mobile and not a native English speaker so bear with me please.

My gf and I are getting married in about 2 weeks. Few months ago my sister who has been single for more than a year asked if she could bring someone. Initially we were both excited she found someone new. But as it turned out she just wanted to bring a friend to our wedding. Someone we don't even know. 

We gave her a subtle no, saying we would prefere having only close friends and relatives at our wedding. She went on about it that she would hardly know anyone at the wedding and would have no fun at all. Which is highly unlikely since we invited our entire family and she went to the bachelorette party they had for my gf.

But eventually the topic was dropped and we figured if was handled. Now 2 weeks before the wedding she suddenly asks me if she can have her plus one.

All the planning has been done, deadline for attendance was June 1st. Seating charts are made, etc. And it would essentially mean we have to put a random stranger at the main table. And do this all last minute contacting the venue again etc. 

So would I be the asshole for putting my foot down and saying its not possible?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2faui	2019-06-19 10:19:08	sweetpotato37	AITA for stealing my sister’s gift idea?	"So it my dad’s birthday tomorrow. He’s very difficult to buy gifts for because he’s one of those people who is very focused on certain things and has few hobbies. Everything he wants, he buys himself. 

So, onto the problem.. I have brought my dad a glow in the dark money pot. He likes to save coins. This is a perfect gift for him and I know he’ll love it because he asked me for one. 

He went through a spate of having money pots gifted to him by my little sister a few years ago. She hasn’t got him one for a few years though. 

He specifically asked me for one this year because he has no empty ones left and no one had given him one for christmas. So I got him one. 

Now it’s the day before his birthday and my younger sister has come downstairs and announced she’s got no money but she’s going to get him a money pot because she’s borrowed some money off of her boyfriend. 

I’ve asked her not to because it would spoil my gift but she’s flipped out and got really angry at me, because “she always gets dad a money pot!” 

Except she doesn’t because my dad asked me to get him one because it’s been over a year since he got a new one. 

So she’s gone out fuming. I feel really guilty. My present is already wrapped because I was prepared weeks ago. I don’t want to change my gift. 

I’ve texted my sister off of my mum’s phone with some different gift ideas which are all pretty cool (a Venus flytrap plant or hemp hand cream, which he loves!) but no reply. I didn’t use my own phone to text because she’s angry with me and would most likely ignore these ideas.

c2f8qs	2019-06-19 10:11:47	thistlethyme	Aita if I ask birth family for medical info to make then acknowledge me?	"My father (65m) was adopted. His birth mother had him at an unmarried mother's home in Ireland, they were together there for several months before he was adopted. I've been searching for his birth mother for 10 years, hoping to let her know he had had a good life (the little I know if the situation suggests she loved him). 

18 months ago I did an Ancestry test, linked with a cousin who helped me track down the birth mother and her children. She told me that the birth mother once talked about never finding peace as she had part of herself missing/unresolved, she feels that this could be about my dad hence giving me the info to track her down. I wrote to the eldest child (the mother is v old, I was worried about the shock of hearing from me out of the blue) and he went back and forth between disbelief and it making sense if stuff. He didn't really understand the DNA thing.

 Eventually he told his siblings. One of them write to me as the family spokesperson, she was polite and offered a few tidbits about her mother and impressed on me the importance of not contacting the mother (dementia would mean she wouldn't understand/would be upset). She offered to share photos/information/meet if I wanted. I replied thanking her, welcoming photos/info/meeting if she was comfortable with it, she replied to say there would be a slight delay but she'd get photos & info to me. That was a year ago and I've heard nothing since.

I feel played (once she had my word I wouldn't contact her mother that was it) and I feel so hurt on my Dad's behalf. He is a great man and they are so ashamed of his existence (the brother told me his sister's were ""mortified""). I've since connected with another cousin and a birth uncle of my dad's who are supportive and ashamed of how their relatives have reacted.

Anyway, my Dad has a procedure coming up, he mentioned the doctor asking for medical history to do with clotting. It isn't essential to know but would be helpful. I am torn between writing to the bio sister and asking for some medical information, partly for the purpose of the procedure but also as a way of forcing them to acknowledge that we are still here, even if they don't respond. It is petty but I don't want them to think they can just smooth talk the ""situation"" away. I'm also a big believer in 2nd chances and harbor a small hope that they would be open to opening the lines of communication but feel too much time has passed to contact me. 

My Dad doesn't want to know anything about his birth family at the moment (the rejection really stings) but has always given his permission for me to lead contact. I didn't anticipate how hurtful it would feel to be rejected considering they're only bio grandparents/aunts/uncles and it is hard to decide whether to go with my heart (contact; also what all my friends suggest) or head (ignore them if they want to ignore us) say.

So, aita if I send a cordial email requesting medical information?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2f7yk	2019-06-19 10:09:08	robinhud64	AITA for not giving a shirt back?	"I shoot videos and take pictures for artists/brands etc. in a city with a pretty big rap scene. 

I’m pretty young, and i’m a white dude. 
I only say that because i feel like sometimes people will try to “scam” me because of my age or ethnicity. 
And of course being the only white dude at a small percentage of shows, i get a little bit of casual/“funny” racism sometimes, but nothing ever too serious. 

Last night i was filming a show for an artist i work with pretty regularly. There were other rappers, some comedians, a few painters, and some clothing brands with booths. i was one of the only white people, and the only white guy the whole night i think.

Artists go by and eventually, this one guy comes on stage with his buddies. Usually having people on stage with you can be kind of cliche, but there were only two people with him and they were getting the crowd pretty excited/hype for the guy. 

I actually REALLY liked the guy’s music - I like to think I’ve been doing this long enough to tell the people who are just rapping for the clout vs. people actually making music worth listening to, and the guy on stage was VERY talented. He had actually flown in from a country specifically to perform at this show, and you could hear the influence of his native culture in his music. I was pretty impressed to say the least, and definitely had a smile on my face while i was getting footage of the performance. 

At the end of his short set, the artist and his buddies started throwing some shirts into the crowd. I’m not really big on merch, but even his shirts were pretty clean so I was hoping to get one. I caught the attention of one of his buddies and he smiled, pointed at me, and threw me a shirt. 

I put it over my shoulder and started getting crowd footage/b-roll etc. 

Another artist goes by, and the OTHER guy that was on stage with the artist, NOT the one that threw the shirt to me, comes up asking for the shirt back. 

Apparently HE didn’t mean to throw it to me and they only have a few left. I gave him a frown cause it was kind of loud, and i didn’t really know what to say. Then he switched it up and was offering to hold it while i finished filming. I said no thanks, and he got a little upset and said something inaudible. Then, very loudly in order to get over the music, he yelled that i was just the camera dude. 

I said “yes, I am” and pulled a business card out of my pocket to to offer him. He frowned and walked away. 

My business partner thinks i pulled a dick move with the card and should’ve just given the shirt back to him. 

I could see it i guess, but i was kind of upset by the fact that they weren’t collecting shirts back from anyone else before or after that (I started paying more attention to them after to see who else they asked, and basically they didn’t)"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2f7sd	2019-06-19 10:08:27	alvaropd9	AITA for cutting out a friend who had/has a crush on me?	"So first of all we met two years ago the first day of college and we soon became close friends. After a drinking night he confessed me he was gay and I assured him that didn’t changed anything in our friendship (I am a straight man). Months later he told me about his depression problems, his bulimia and wanting to end his life. I know, it sounds sad and tragic but try to keep up and objective.

I tried to help him that year and he went to therapy and apparently got better. I then moved to another city but we FaceTimed on a regular basis and I asked our mutual friends to keep an eye on him but did not tell the whole story as he was not out of the closet and felt very pressured by the college conservative environment. Here comes the plot twist.

Two weeks ago I found an anonymous instagram account with pictures from all the movies we watched together that year with secretive captions about his loneliness and sadness AND AT THE VERY LAST POST A LOVE DECLARATION WITH MY FULL NAME ON IT. He also wrote that he fell for me the very first day we met and practically blame me for all his problems. I debated for several days whether I should do something or not, as I was worried about his dramatic reaction leading to him doing something stupid. I finally  confronted  him  and told him to delete the account and never put my name on something like that. He first denied knowing what I was talking about, but then deleted the account and apologized. 

Something about his apology made me feel like he was trying to make me feel bad and I left him on read. 

We haven’t talked since then, his birthday is approaching and I really don’t know if I Am The Asshole for cutting him out of my life. I feel betrayed and used as he specifically wrote he wanted to be more than friends from the very beginning and I can’t help but thinking that he told me all of his problems (that now I wonder if were ever true) so we would have a deeper confidence.  Also, he ruined me visiting my friends from that college as I cannot either be there without meeting him nor tell my friends what happened between us without them knowing everything."

None of my other extended family wanted to take the cat so my parents and sisters have been discussing potentially taking his cat. I am frustrated with this for a few reasons, one being that I have pet birds that have been in my household for 9 years and their safety is my priority, two being that I'm scared of cats, and three being that I think cats are smelly from their litter box and four being that I think our household has enough animals already (a dog, my birds, and a few reptiles). AITA for not wanting to adopt the cat? I suggested that we take the cat in temporarily and try to find it a good home rather then take it to the shelter.	No A-holes here	0	0

My mum agreed to be nephews guarantor for his housing at University. He didn’t pay his rent and was £1,000 behind that they chased my mum for after getting nowhere with nephew or sister. It got to the point that debt collectors were threatened.  My mum paid £600 to keep them away on the basis that nephew or sister would pay the balance and pay her back when they could.

Note: mum had to be medically retired early due to health issues exaggerated by stress. This was literally all her savings after paying to move and take other steps to manage her health.

It’s been over a year and they have not even offered a penny towards paying mum back.

My plan is to give mum any money that I would spend on either of them for birthdays, xmas etc. Until they start paying her back. If I do this WIBTA?

I don’t plan on telling them I am doing this as I don’t want them to think yay, not our problem anymore but, when they notice I haven’t gotten them gifts there will likely be a big fall out."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2f483	2019-06-19 09:55:57	uyeisyerineaittir	WIBTA If I let my employee(manager) go?	"DISCLAIMER: This is obviously a burner account as my original account is known by my friends, colleagues and so on.

So I run a business in Istanbul, Turkey which is a touristic shop that sells spices and other local products mostly to foreign and local tourists. I do not actually own the company, the original owner of it is my longtime friend and he lets me run the business for him in exchange for a rental fee. (Which is odd because under every formal document there's his signature, he signs them for me. By doing it, he relies solely on my trade because by nature I am getting in debt in the name of him.) 

So there is a guy in my shop that sells most of the products out of all the employees. I give him all kind of exceptions and try to make him happy (like last week I gave him 5 days off just because he said me he 'felt' such a vacation.) Whenever he feels ill, he comes to the shop, does what he needs to do in order to make shop ready in the first 2-3 hours and then says he feels ill and neither I nor the manager of shop pressure him, we usually let him go to hospital and generally give him an off-day without a paycut. He has been in many scuffles past 3-4 days and constantly discussed harshly with his colleagues. I've been thinking of letting him go for the past weeks as he had discussed with my manager as well, causing hierarchical problems and ego wars within the shop. 

This morning, I heard that the two have been involved in another discussion and that my manager swears on the said employee. I called them both and listened the story from both sides. They were too angry at each other that I decided it is impossible for them to work together anymore. I told my manager to go out of the office and said the other employee that we should part ways with him. He understood and said he was neither angry nor disappointed at me. He then proceeded to his pocket to show me a paper. He said that yesterday his manager wanted to send him to the bank and take a credit in the name of himself. The manager wrote a paper in the name of my childhood friend (legal owner of the shop) and signed it in the name of him.

Now I don't want to step back of my initial decision to let the employee go because he didn't tell me or show the paper to me until he was sure he was fired. I also want to penalize the manager as he embarassed me and I would be worse than dead if my friend found out about this. Now WIBTA if I let both of them go? Is there any other ways to penalize him silently without publicizing the issue because my manager and I have been working together for more than 15 years?

TLDR; am a employer, accidentaly learned my employee is getting involved in a fraud which also regards my childhood friend, WIBTA if I fire him?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So today, my friend (jack) and I just finished exams and a heated argument came up. So what happened was that Jack and I went to a festival and I had to drive because he did not have any mode of transport. I offered to give him a life there and back, where I assumed that he would pay half for fuel expenses. 

The thing is he has had a hard childhood and has gone through foster care system. Whereas, I have been to a private school and not had to pay a days rent. Also, the way I’m laying for fuel is through my own causal job. 

The thing is, I don’t think I should be paying for his expenses at all. I feel like any individual should pay there own way and not have to rely on others. If they can’t pay there way, they should just not go to the festival. I’m sure this is fair, but I feel like my mates are calling me the asshole for this. 

TLDR: mate wanted me to pay for fuel expenses even though I drove him to a festival. The only reason for me paying is because I went to a private school and parents support me."		1	0

Recently I find myself upset almost all the time about my parents. Quick backstory: We were extremely poor all my entire life, barely any good, no warm water etc. We’re still struggling a lot nowadays but I finally landed my first job. I’m still living with my parents (at 21).

Now I just started my drivers license (here it costs around 2.3k) which I of course pay for it by myself. I only make 1.4k a month which is overall really amazing. This month I need to pay roughly 510€ for the license. My education is still being paid off (around 290€ a month), my parents want me to pay it off. Don’t get me wrong, I love them and yes, I get it, I should pay it of course. But lately it feels like my parents guilt trip me into giving money. For example: I tell my dad that I’m proud that I can finally think about moving out (when I got the drivers license) and build my own life. My dad usually replies with „yeah really? You know you have to pay for your education, another 10€ for food (which is fine) and because of your decision of that education we have no money at all.“ 

What I’m trying to er across is, that my parents seem to blame all financial issues on me. When I’m upset my mom often tells me how my father went to jail for me (money issues) and how I’m the most money draining person (I don’t buy new clothes at all, I often get them from friends, I don’t go out etc). My parents also bought two damn restaurants out in the middle of nowhere and are now in extreme debt. After the first one failed miserably, they decided to get another one for unknown reasons. I’m still mad at them for that. We still struggle a lot with that. 

I love them so much, but it feels like they blame it all on me. They don’t listen at all (Please don’t buy another restaurant, please don’t take onto a credit you can never pay back, please stop buying so much food we can’t and won’t eat, stop buying garden stuff that’ll never be used etc) and just... I don’t know man. I guess I’m upset cause I was so damn proud of getting a job after a year of unemployment and thought about moving out, building a life and all.

Me: Why did you drop it in the first place?
Her: Because i had no ammo
Me: I don't drop my weapons even if i have no ammo lol
Her: You just don't understand!

I said sorry and she kicked me from the group. 

I told her it's just a game, then she told me i make childish jokes and that i'm immature (What would you expect from a 16 year old)

after a few minutes he deleted his stickers and all was well until i got to class.

After 6th grade all of my closest friend transferred to a different school. I didn't really have other close friends but I would occasionally talk to my other classmates. Two of the people who I talked to occasionally were actually pretty cool so in 7th grade I hung out with them, they had 3 more friends who I also talked to occasionally.

They were all pretty fun to be around with but I always felt left out when hanging out with them. I didn't talk to them about this issue because I didn't want to start a fight. One of the things that made me feel left out is when we have to go in pairs for school but none of them came up to me even though there were 6 of us, when I ask one of them to be my partner even though they said yes it felt like they just agreed so that I won't feel bad.

I also felt really left out when it was recess or lunch because when we're going to the cafeteria they'd always go out in pairs sometimes even it threes and I was just left there. I didn't think about these stuff before because I knew that it would really fuck with my head.

The night before the last practice day for recognition my mom went to the doctor because she felt some bumps beside her breast. This made me worry a lot because of what happened to my biological mom in the past. The next day I was really quiet and kept asking what time it was, I was also rushing to go home but nobody asked me why even after all of us were at home. I knew that they knew when I was in a bad mood because I become really moody and really quiet (I'm a really loud person). The next time we saw each other I found out that they went put to eat at a place near our school, nobody told me that there were plans even though I wouldn't have come because of the situation I would have appreciated if they told me.

This made me really insecure about myself because I feel like I was trying to fit in too much and I kept asking myself on what was wrong with me, this was when I left the group chat saying ""please don't ask.""

Three of them reached out but I just left them on read. One of them I responded to because she was always the one who gave me advice whenever I was feeling down. I told her my reasons and she said sorry to me.

I am asking if I was the asshole because if someone did the same thing I think I would be very worried if they weren't responding to me.

We live in a small 2 bedroom apartment. My day starts at 6am and hers at 8am and we both have standard 9-5 jobs. 

Situation: its getting a bit warm during the summer and with the AC being non-functional, we’re just going at it with keeping windows open + two little fans. Keeping the door open also helps circulate some air. However, during the night, the smallest teeny tiniest noise i make wakes her up, from going to the bathroom, getting something to drink, and sometimes even rolling over in my bed. This wasn’t a problem when we started out because we kept the doors closed. However, over the summer, she insists that she can’t sleep without her door being open because of the heat. As a result I’m forced to keep my door closed and basically have to take 20 mins to be extra super quiet if i ever dare exit my room or even roll around in bed. This could all be fixed by her closing her door. She also says that she wouldn’t be comfortable with something like ear plugs and those sleeping mask things. I cant even turn on any lights or use the flashlight from my phone to walk around because those also wake her up. This can all be solved by her closing her door, but she calls me selfish, among other words, for asking this.

Note that she also (like any human) also goes around at night for bathroom etc but I don’t mind because I don’t notice.

c2enaa	2019-06-19 08:53:07		AITA for not wanting to bring my gf to my friend’s event?	"My old college friend’s girlfriend is having a 3 day rave with tons of stuff planned over the three days - kind of like a mini festival. There’s going to be around 50 people at this event, and so my friend extended the invite to myself and our group of friends who my gf has met several times before and get along well with. I invited my gf initially when I found out about this event but at the time, I thought I’d be seeing my friends before the event.

Unfortunately, this didn’t happen and now I’m having second thoughts. While it’s not that I don’t want my girlfriend to be there, the last time we all saw each other together as a group was about a year ago so it would be nice to spend some time with just my friends. My gf is also new to the area and doesn’t have a ton of friends because of that yet, and so she is upset as said she was looking forward to going, but I’d also just like some time with my friends which I feel is justified.

I will admit that I went through a rough patch and refused to see her for a few years as I was hurting. my ex boyfriend re married and my daughter has a second mom. 

I messaged my ex boyfriend and asked if I could see her and he refused to let me, he told me that I was never aloud to see her until she wants to. 
I pushed a little and tried to get him to atleast let me see her once but he still refuses. I tried explaining that I want a relationship with her and that I want to start fresh with her and he did not listen.

c2elob	2019-06-19 08:46:25	justforfunsies111	WIBTA is I ask my sisters if they’ve stolen something from me?	"I’m going to preface this by saying that I love my sisters dearly, and I’m okay with sometimes sharing my stuff if they ask me politely and don’t act entitled to use the clothes or things I’ve bought myself and don’t intend on using. 

A couple weeks ago, I went shopping, and bought myself some mini perfumes, as I was going to a camp for a week. I ended up leaving one of them at home, on my bedroom floor, when I left for the camp. The camp ended this past Saturday, and it took me a couple days before I finished unpacking. It’s only today that I notice my perfume isn’t on the floor where I’ve left it. 

Both my sisters have a habit of taking my stuff, with or without asking if they can use it first. My little sister is better at owning up and apologizing when she gets caught, and my older sister, even when caught, refused to accept responsibility. 

Both of them start yelling defensively even if I ask them “Hey, have you seen this?” because they immediately assume I’m accusing them of stealing. Granted, in the past, I have jumped immediately to accusing them before, but I’m trying to fix that by asking them if they’ve seen my things first and where I might look, because I am a bit disorganized and have found some things I once thought they took. 

Tonight, I’ve spent time cleaning my room, looking all over the floor, my desk, under my bed, the bathroom, and my clothing drawers to look for it. It’s entirely possible I might have moved it before I left, but I don’t think I did. The only place I haven’t looked is my car, and that’s because a) it’s dark and b) I already have a perfume in there. I know my older sister, at least, spent time on my room while I was away at camp, and was defensive when I asked her why her resume had been left on my desk. 

So, WIBTA if I asked them if they’d seen my perfume, knowing they’ll probably immediately jump on the defensive and start yelling? This would be after I check my car for it."	No A-holes here	0	0

"About a day or two ago, I went out to get smoothies with a few of my friends. One of my friends was wearing his brand new shoes out for the first time. That friend asked the lady at the counter for a taste test of the smoothie, and she gave it to him in a small cup. I was standing at the counter next to them, looking elsewhere, with my elbow resting on the counter . My friend tries the smoothie and passes it to my other friend who tries it as well. My other friend then proceeds to place the half full taste cup behind my elbow on the counter. When I turned around to order (still not noticing the cup), my elbow knocked the taste test cup onto the floor, right onto my friends new shoes. My friend then started explaining that it was all my fault and that I would either need to clean up his shoes or buy him a new pair. I disagreed with him and we began to argue in the smoothie place. My two other friends (who both agreed that it wasn’t all my fault) decided not to say anything, so now my friend is mad at me.

c2ecdv	2019-06-19 08:10:34	Nacho_Slug	AITA for being mad at my girlfriend for accidentally locking me out of the house again?	My girlfriend [20F] and I [20M] recently moved in together. We've been living together for a little short of 3 months now. I work night shifts (usually home at 11:00pm) and she works morning shifts (usually leaves for work at 4:00am). Once a week I have to work until 12:30am and tonight was that night. I actually got off a little early and got to the apartment at about 12:30. I went to unlock the door, but couldn't get in since she had accidentally put the latch on the door. This has happened maybe 3-4 times before, but one phone call will wake her up. I call, no answer. I call again, no answer. I called maybe 10 times, nothing. Oh boy. I cracked the door open a little and yelled her name. Nothing. I yelled 4 more times, but still nothing. I didn't want to wake up any neighbors so I resorted to calling some more. I called 30 times, still nothing. Its now 1:45, and I still can't get in. At this point, I start trying to break in. All my attempts are unsuccessful, but very noisy. I figured at least the noise would wake her up. Its about 3 AM at this point. I've called her 60 times. Sent 15 or so texts. I've screamed inside the apartment. I've thrown rocks at the window. I'm really worried at this point that she could be hurt or worse, explaining why she couldn't hear me. I start to panic and let my anxiety get to me. I finally get in at 3:30 (i managed to pry the latch away with a huge piece of plastic I found). I rush to the bedroom to make sure she's ok: She's sound asleep in bed with her phone right next to her. I let my emotions get the best of me, and I yelled at her. I regretted yelling at her immiediately. I feel terrible for yelling at her, I was totally overwhelmed with emotions (not trying to excuse anything). I was mostly glad she was safe. That being said, I still think me being angry is justified. I was locked out of the apartment for several hours. I try and think how she would've reacted in the same situation and I feel like she would've been just as angry. She has gotten angry at me over times where I have not woken up to her phone calls and messages. I'm not one to get angry, but I was fuming from everything that happened. I am definitely apologizing for yelling, that was totally inappropriate. However, I'm not sure if I should take total blame for everything or if its appropriate for me to be mad at her as well.

c2ec1k	2019-06-19 08:09:15	Dragonatrix	AITA shaving off neice's hair	"C has always been into boys cloths, and toys etc, since she was a toddler, it took many years of perseverance for her Mum to reluctantly allow this attire, eventually, and ever since C was happy & comfortable, not to mention, she felt more like herself and far less self conscious.

So C has been going on & on & on for a year and a half, throughout this time C makes it VERY clear, repeatedly to mum, that she hates her hair, she is not comfortable having hair. Shes been saying this most of her life, that she wants it off.

So she had this booked for a week to get done, cash fell through at the last minute, she begged & begged for me to cut it, i agreed as it's what shes been after for a long ass time 

I absolutely tried to be neutral, giving advice to not feel pressured, and that she could back out anytime, i repeated this several times to make sure C was comfortable.

As C is donating the hair to make wigs for cancer patients, a full 22"" of smooth, silky hair ready to make wigs, a slip was prined, hair in pleat, got a padded envelope, so C is 100% wants this and is very excited its being donted to a good cause.

Side note.... C has an older sister N 16yo.... now their mum gave N cash specifically for a tattoo, at some ranson guys house, it looks like my 7yo drew it, its a mess, and needs fixed, but more to the point its PERMANENT.

Sitting down, towel on, sissors and clippers at the ready, again i say u can back out, dont feel pressured, C's responce ""i cant wait im sooo excited""

A quick snip snip, pleat goes into envelope, please be aware that C has printed the donation slip several months ago, she repeatedly told mum that the hair cut was happening at some point, so mum was well aware of this.

After the pleat was gone, C wanted to start small, so opted for #4, this was not short enought, so went to #2

C was OVER THE MOON, absolutely ecstatic.

hair do sorted, one VERY HAPPY kid. Absolutely looks great, and more to the point it suits her personality.

C's mum fell out with me, then immediately used my daughter as a weapon against me, she sent me viles txts, and continued to do this all night. Mum knows im extremely sensitive due to severe enxiety and depression etc, etc, I also get very flustered and loose my words, so i cant even put C' point accress, my brain freezes, but im not really bothered bc shes a drama queen, and quite toxic, likes stirring the pot, and thrives of conflict and drama etc, 

Im glad C got what she wanted, but hair grows, i had a #1 for years when my gran's hair fell out due to cancer, and tbh its was the most liberating and comfortable ive ever felt, so i get why C wanted this, she took a bold step, shes comfortable and is sooo happy!

c2eaza	2019-06-19 08:05:00	chowderman24	AITA for telling my little sister that her pet hedgehog died during our vacation to Hawaii?	"  Hey reddit! So a little background on this story. So around five months ago, my parents finally gave into my little sister’s wishes of having a pet hedgehog after receiving one from mutual friends who could no longer care for her anymore. It came as a surprise to my twin sister and I, but Hazel the hedgehog began to grow on us and was really adorable.
  Hazel was given all the proper care she needed and was frequently taken outside for play by my sister. As the weeks passed many red flags began to pop up regarding her health such as pee contaminated with her blood. Hazel was eventually taken to the vet and a tumor was found in her body.  Nothing much was thought of it other than that her life span would be cut short and that any day could be her last. This realization came to the rest of the family and me, but not my little sister as she ignored the possibility of her precious hedgehog dying.
  Eventually June came and hazel had gotten through the past months just fine. She was as playful as always and my whole family adored her. Furthermore we just left this Sunday(Father’s Day) for our vacation to Hawaii and were able to get family friends who had previously owned a hedgehog to care for Hazel while we’re gone. Fast forward to last night and my parents receive a text from the Hazel’s caregivers that she was dying and hours later the death was confirmed. We know they’re not in the wrong as this death could of happened at any time. 
  Therefore came the process of trying to tell my younger sister about the death. I proposed we tell her when we get back from Hawaii, which would be this upcoming Saturday, so that way her trip isn’t ruined with grief and sadness, but the rest of my family wanted to tell her now because they didn’t want to carry the guilt over their heads the whole week. I came to agreement with them and we ended up breaking the news tonight, and she was devastated, which was expected. She’s been crying for about an hour and we’re hoping that the rest of the trip will fare well. So I’d like to get some feedback if my family and I are in the assholes here or if we should’ve waited till the end of the trip. Any comments appreciated. Thanks!"	No A-holes here	0	0

I got a pay rise last year and decided to start saving it, I already had a savings account for general things but this one would be for a fun trip. 

I have a 13 year old daughter from a previous marriage, I get her on holidays and every second weekend. the mother of my child re married and had another girl, she is 10. 

both the girls are incredibly close and love each other so much. I decided that going to Australia would be awesome as I've never been to Australia zoo and I'm a huge fan of steve irwan so that is a plus. 

I spoke to my daughter and she is super excited, and I mean the jump up and down screaming excited. she has never left the country. 

at first my ex wife was fine, that was untill the 10 year old expressed how unhappy she was that she could not go. I am not a fan of her going as I dont know her terribly well and I wanted a daddy and daughter bonding time. 

I've really hurt the 10 year olds feelings and my ex wife has been pressuring me to take her.

c2e9nc	2019-06-19 08:00:05		WIBTA for telling my aunt her son needs to be tutored.	"Throwaway because people know my main. 

Me (17M) and my cousins, X (age irrelevant M) and Y (12M) have always been close. My family has always been very close with their side of the family, so we often go on vacation together, visit each other whenever possible, etc. I love them both, but sometimes I feel like Y gets babied a bit because he is younger. This special treatment has been going on for a long time, and I feel like it has stunted his academic growth. He’s a really bright kid (both X and Y are) and he’s able to grasp complicated concepts, like math and science, pretty well, but even though he’s about to start middle school, he has trouble reading at a pretty fundamental level. To a point where during party games, he needs help reading words (like catchphrase or charades). He is in no way a dumb kid, and I can’t help but think that his parents haven’t pushed him enough to learn to read sufficiently. I’ve never heard his or my parents bring up dyslexia, so I don’t believe that’s why he has trouble. Would I be an asshole if I asked his parents why he had trouble reading, and to push him to learn how to read sufficiently (possibly tutoring)?

My entire family was suspicious of their relationship but the two only came clean when the woman’s husband found them together this year in february.

Now my parents are almost divorced and the woman is also divorced. For our family, my dad was the one that wanted the divorce (my mom was willing to work things out). One week after the divorce, my dad came to our house (he’s not living with us anymore) and told me and my mom that we need to get used to Hannah from now on because she’s his girlfriend.

I took it in the worst way possible because I felt hurt. Especially because for one month straight he told me he doesn’t care about anyone romantically.

I talked to him and told him to not involve my little siblings (7 f/m) in their relationship in anyway. Also, my mom talked to Hannah and told her to stay the fuck away from the little kids. They were both fine with the idea and accepted our decision...

Until one week later (last week) when they went on a 4 days trip together...which broke me because my dad lied to my face once again.

Of course I hate that he is still dating Hannah but he keeps telling me that is non of my business and that I’m basically a really bad person for hating her. He also tells me that I should not get involved in his relationship (by having an opinion cuz I’m not talking to her) and that I am the one that lets myself be affected by it.

It's 2:15ish, I'm still wired from a night shif tI'd gotten home from barely over an hour prior, amd trying to get stoned so I CAN get to sleep.

"Background: I(23ftm) have been transitioning for 3 months now. My boyfriend(23m) went to the same high school as me and knew me before I started transitioning. Shortly before I began my transition we caught up online, started talking again, which eventually led to hanging out on a regular basis. During this time he was dating someone and I came out to everyone, including him. He seemed really accepting, so we contiued to hanging out, even more so because I had quite a few friends I loss when I came out. Little less than a month later, he and his gf broke up because they wanted different things in life (she wants kids, specifically soon, and he doesn't want kids at all) shortly after that we started dating.

The other night we were talking and the topic of sexuality got brought up and he stated that he is a straight dude, always has been always will be, and that (besides me) he's only ever dated cis women. That led to me asking if he'd stay with me if I had bottom surgery, which is a definite thing I plan in my future, and he more or less shrugged the question off and talked about how it's something that is potentially years away and he'll cross that bridge when it arrives. Feeling a little hurt, I asked him if he would ever date me if I was born a dude, and was exactly the same as I now beside being born with a penis, and it was a hard no from him.

The whole conversation made me feel as if he doesn't actually view me as male or seriously sees me as going to fully transition to male. I'm starting hrt soon and I dont think he realizes the full affect it has. I wont just be a Tomboy, or girl who looks a bit masculine.

So today I woke up not in the greatest mood. I didn’t take it out on my boyfriend, didn’t yell at him or anything. I was kind of just whatever & I was super exhausted. I’ve been having bad dreams lately that get me down and I try my best to not let it effect me or how I treat/talk to my boyfriend. My boyfriend noticed I wasn’t in a chirpy mood this morning and the first thing he asks is “do you not want me anymore”, he asks this whenever I get in these moods. I just told him how I felt and that it had nothing to do with him and we went on about our day and went to work. Throughout the day we were texting and he was just making the whole situation and how i’m feeling about him when i’ve told him it wasn’t. So anyway, before we meet up for lunch like we always do, I have a conversation with my co workers that was pretty funny. I ended up laughing and when he picks me up, he noticed the change in my mood. I told him the funny story and expected him to laugh but instead he said it sucks how you’re so negative with me but you can laugh with your co workers and be so happy. I told him that wasn’t the case and I’ve been trying to shake off this mood. I thought by telling him I wouldn’t even be feeling as bad as I had been that day and he would be happy that I started feeling better. He then says that if I really wasn’t in a good mood then I wouldn’t have laughed with my co workers.

"My brother (28) and his wife (30) have been married for a few years now and together for over 10. They’ve known since the first few years they were together that they wanted kids. I (23) won’t get into what jobs they do, but my brother mainly focuses on manual labor and has no desire to deal with a higher position that would require responsibilities, aka he never has the extra money to save. 

Right now as it is, we all live together. We live in an expensive city that none of us can afford to move out from at this point. A few days ago my sister in law excitedly ran up to me saying, “Guess what?! I’m getting off my birth control next month!” There was no discussion with me and I feel a bit annoyed. I’m not apart of their couple and I understand I have no say, but the situation that we’re currently in is a tricky one.

We currently live with our parents who are moving out at the end of this year and are leaving this place to us. Now, this house needs a lot of work. I mean, A LOT. Floors are coming up, electricity and plumbing is extremely outdated and overall I’m worried with us living here - let alone an infant. It’s a miracle a floor hasn’t busted and sent one of us to the ER. We’ve discussed our options on this place a few times. This house has been in the family for almost 70 years, so selling is a last resort to me. I would prefer to try and fix this house up over time and rent it out- which involves money. Which my brother and his wife don’t have. And now they want to focus on having a child. While living with me. 

I will admit, I’m CF (child free) I have no issues with children besides just not wanting to have my own. I’m actually excited they want to have children, just not while I’m living with them in this house. I fear that they will never have the money to help fix the house and ultimately not leave. It doesn’t sit well with me that they want to pretty much take over the family home and not give me an option at anything else. It also doesn’t sit well with me that nothing was discussed. My own father told me today he also doesn’t think they’re quite ready just yet and he’s worried that they won’t leave the family home either.

c2e0ru	2019-06-19 07:26:30	speeza	AITA for going on a trip without my girlfriend to a city we both want to visit?	"As it says.  I’ll try to give some unbiased info.  

So my gf and I have been dating awhile and we love to travel (we bonded while in a foreign country together with some friends).  So far we’ve visited a couple countries and are planning a big trip this fall to Southeast Asia.   We’ve also thrown around a lot of little travel ideas, all tentative with no real date set (“oh maybe next year we could do this!  Or this!”).  One of which is New Orleans, which neither of us has been before.  

I had been itching to go this year, mostly due to the fact that I’ve watched a number of friends and acquaintances visit and all have returned with similar praises.  She had shown some interest, as well, but unfortunately, due to saving for our big trip this fall and other small trips we have to make home, it looked like NOLA would have to wait until next year.   

HOWEVER, unbeknownst to me, my friend and coworker won tickets, free airfare, and lodging in New Orleans this summer for a convention taking place in July (5 days), and he wants to take me as his +1.  I was thrilled.  I’ve never had anything like this happen to me and it was almost too convenient that it happened right when I’ve been dying to take a small reprieve from work.  

The trip is actually FOR my job as well, because the convention pertains to my current employment (bartender) and we would be doing a lot of learning along with drinking, which to be fair, will be a lot.  

I knew my gf would be disappointed when I broke the news to her, so I decided to ask her if she wanted to come along immediately after I explained the whole situation, saying my friend won tickets, he wants me to come, I’m not really paying for anything except food and leisure stuff, etc.  

The reaction I got from her was anger, pure and simple.  She said “I wasn’t thinking of her” because I didn’t phrase my request for her to come right at the forefront of the conversation, saying “I’m just an afterthought to you”, and then proceeded to make a comment along the lines of “why isn’t your friend’s wife coming?”, and “oh two guys without their girlfriends in New Orleans.  Awesome”.  I tried to explain to her that my friend’s wife doesn’t drink and is too busy to take time off to go, that he invited me because we are in the same profession.  When I asked my gf again if she wanted to go, she said no she can’t, that it would look bad because she cancelled on a friend’s wedding to save some money.  We also just got a dog that would need sitting.  

Now, I’ve never cheated on my girlfriend.  I haven’t had an interest in any other woman since I’ve dated her.  I would also never go to a place she’s been wanting to go for a long time (France) without her.  But am I the asshole for taking my friend up on this offer and going without her? Part of me feels like she’s feeling jealous, which I completely understand, but her response was surprising and I’d like some outside opinions.

c2e06g	2019-06-19 07:24:30	broccolimemes	AITA for charging my ex 100k to be rid of me?	"So, I came home after a trip early. Something felt off during my trip when my ex didn't respond to my messages or calls at all; this is not why I was back early. The ex says we need to talk. The talk is we are broken up now and they walkout. We were together for nearly a decade and I truly felt in love. So, this came as a shock to me. They can't give an exact reason why. They simply say they are selfish. I think there is more to it then that. But, I am not the one for them.Most of their stuff was already boxed. It dawned on me this was something they had been planning and my ex eventually told me they had planned it for months. It was clear my ex wanted to be gone before I returned.

&#x200B;

The thing is, nine months ago we went 50-50 on a house and we need to settle that. Their half of the home purchase came from their parents and they offered to buy me out using the same source. They essentially offered half the current estimate from an online home listing site, which is not nearly enough to cover even the costs of closing let alone what I put in interest and repairs and improvements and my expectation essentially to have this house as my foreseeable future. So, I did some research and found that it can be very expense and painful to buy a person out who shared title on property. Essentially, they would need to lawyer up and ultimately neither of us get the house and the house is required to be sold at auction (likely at a large discount) and the proceeds get dulled out evenly. So, I essentially said you can buy me out at my half the value of the house plus 100k. My rationale is that this should cover some of the loss of future revenue that I assumed from our future owning the house together; enough that I would be in good shape to move into another home. After I told my ex my buyout price, my ex told me that there are multiple times they said they wanted to break up, but that it was my fault for convincing them not to because I made them feel more confident in our relationship and future together. I don't agree with that, but from their actions in breaking-up I can see that they wanted to avoid emotional pain or avoid confrontation."	No A-holes here	0	0
c2dxxw	2019-06-19 07:16:20		WIBTA for not working for my parents	"So a little bit of background on the situation. At this time, I'm currently going to college out of state and this takes place in US. My parents who barely speak any English decided to open up a fast food Indian restaurant a few years back. Prior to them opening up the restaurant, I told them and warned them not to open up the restaurant since they did not speak much English, and running a business would be extremely hard and stressful as a result. I told them that if they did open it up, I would not be helping them with the process. I made sure that they were fully aware of it, and they sort of blew it off, ignored me and opened it up. So they end up getting things running with the help of some friends and lawyers and things are good to go for the first year or so. After that first year, things became harder and harder for them so I caved in and I would go in on multiple occasions and help out when I was back from college when they really needed me to even though I already told them prior that I would not be helping out. I had to go in because it was difficult for them to hire someone who spoke both Hindi and English since they needed someone to run the cash registers. The people who work the position are constantly coming and going since it's really difficult and the pay isn't that great. As a result it becomes extremely difficult to hire people who will consistently work for the position. Personally for me, I hated working there and warned them numerous times throughout the years that I would not be helping them out anymore after that.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the present, I've just graduated college, moved back home and am currently looking for a full time job. Since I've been back, I went in a few more times to help out occasionally when needed and recently told them that it would definitely be my final time there. I've caved in in the past multiple times because after all they're my parents, but I'm just tired of them ignoring me when I tell them that I don't want to work there. They ignore me again as usual and a few weeks ago they tell me that they need me to fill in for the position one or two days of the week until they find someone to fill the position (which could take months). I'm currently living at home for free, but I have things that I want to do while I'm still looking for a job. I would feel really bad if I said no since they are my parents after all, but I've told them multiple times that I would not be up for the job anymore and they've consistently ignored what I've said throughout the years. 

WIBTA if I told them no and actually stuck to my decision of not helping them out this time?"		1	0
c2dxnb	2019-06-19 07:15:25	urquhartloch	WIBTA if I told my dad to just hire it out?	"For some context my family has owned a ranch since it was homesteaded back when my state was still a territory. And aside from a recent split in ownership most of the buildings and fencing were constructed around that time. Last year my grandfather passed away and we have been trying to keep everything together since then. But the majority of the ranch is at the point in its life when it starts falling apart either from rust, use, or both.

&#x200B;

I am expected to come out and help as often as possible. Repairing fence, feeding cattle, helping to fix buildings and machines when they break down, cleaning up, etc. Truth be told it needs someone out there working almost 24/7  to get it back up and running and to be honest that's not me. Right now its my uncle and a couple of my cousins who are supposed to be working out there as my dad is recovering from knee surgery. I am currently in my senior year of college for engineering and I have no intention of being a rancher for the rest of my life. Far from it. I actually want to eventually work on aerospace and interplanetary colony projects (just dreams right now).

&#x200B;

Currently I am making excuse after excuse as to why I cant come over and help. ""I have a test and I need to study."" or ""I have homework I need to work on."" Are my most common excuses. In truth I don't have any friends that I speak to regularly (a couple of texts once a semester). I don't really have any hobbys or anything that I do outside of school and work. And I really want some of those things before I enter the monotony of work. I have even heard them talk about hiring some of the local high school kids to come over and work for the summer but the ranch has been losing money the past several years.

Long story short we began arguing quite a lot, they started acting like an asshole, then I found out some stuff about them that's really questionable.

A few months ago after we stopped talking, I ended up anonymously reporting them to the government for tax evasion. This person has openly admitted to never paying taxes on most of their income - I'd guess they earn $60k in cash (legal where I live, in their profession) and only declare enough to stay below the tax thresholds. I fully believe everyone should have to pay their taxes, but honestly, a good part of my motivation was based on revenge. Nothing seems to have happened yet so I assume they've been let off, or the whole thing has been ignored."		1	0

c2dvr5	2019-06-19 07:08:44		AITA for not letting a kid go to the bathroom where I work?	"So I'm working at the front desk of a small doctor's practice, we are located in a small group of shops, we face out towards the a car park, most of the others face in towards a square. So if you park on one side we are the first place you see. We are also a private practice, so basically just like any other business, you can't just walk in and receive treatment. 

The other day I'm sitting at the front desk, its around 4:30pm/5pm so we are fairly quiet but there's a few people sitting and waiting, when a middle aged lady and her son who looked about 10 burst in. They make a beeline towards the hallway where the toilet is before stopping next to my desk. The mum asks me if they can use our toilet. I quickly ask if they're a patient, they say no. I say ""Sorry, no you can't, there's a public toilet in the square."" In a polite voice. The mum repeats ""public toilet"" sounding surprised and I say ""Yep just over there"" pointing in the general direction of the square. Its less than a hundred meters away but a little hard to spot if you're not close to it. The kid looks pretty desperate to go, so they don't stand around and argue, but the mum does shoot me two glances, the first I ignore, the second attracted my attention slightly and she says ""that's rough"" in a sarcastic tone. 

I glance over at my coworker who doesn't really care, but says she probably would have let them go to the bathroom. I point out we are the ones who clean the toilet, and we have to do it tonight. She admits that she prefers that I didn't let them.

c2dvqn	2019-06-19 07:08:41	whitecollarpizzaman	AITA for moving into a building which I objected to the construction of in the first place?	"I know this does not make me like a grade A asshole, but I sometimes wonders if I’m a bit loose on my integrity when I ponder this, especially considering I was somewhat vocal on the issue. 

Long story short, there a few neighborhoods near the center of my city, including in the center itself, in which my roommate and I were shopping for apartments. Pretty expensive rent in the area, so we were on the prowl for a deal, and with a lot of new construction on the market, most buildings were willing to make concessions. We finally found a place, 6th floor (top) unit, with a whole month’s rent free. It has all the amenities we wanted, particularly covered parking, a pool, and so much more. Not uncommon in modern apartment buildings, but for the price it was a steal. Now here’s the caveat: I hated this building from the start.

I’m a development buff, and believe strongly that new construction should contribute to the fabric of the neighborhood, and frankly this building does not. It’s a huge monolith that contains 329 individual apartments over an entire block, with train tracks on one side. It contains no retail, and demolished a block of old buildings, with the exception of a saloon that refused to sell (think UP!) I said again and again of various development forums that this building was too big, and that something much better could’ve been built in its place, especially considering plans for a streetcar and light rail line are in the works right near by. But now, I live here. Does that make me an asshole/hypocrite? I do genuinely like the building as a resident, but I still do believe it fails to add much street engagement to the neighborhood, though frankly it’s not the worst development in the city."

c2dvfh	2019-06-19 07:07:36	terralovespandabears	AITA For calling in?	"I've worked at a local supermarket in my city for about 2 and a half years now. I'm a full time student and part-time employee and have always tried pushing myself as hard as I possibly can when it comes to both my education and my job. I don't normally ask for time off or call in unless its something majorly important.

For some background info I basically work two departments and anytime my manager needs me to work for them I always come in whether its a day off, work extra hours, etc. My managers have always commented on how I work hard and how they wished they could have me full time, and I always laugh it off and say college is more important in my life atm (I'm working on a BA for Computer Science).About two weeks in advance I asked if I could have Sunday-Wednesday off for finals (3 classes with finals on different days with Sunday being a study day) and afterwards I offered to work as much as possible for them. Well they gave me the Monday-Wednesday off and I was fine with that *at first.* I didn't say anything and just agreed to it Well...that was until...The work day was already hell in a hand basket at this point for other reasons. I had already been stressing about finals, having a small surgery a few weeks prior, and working a lot of hours only to have this happen while on break:  
Manager: By the way your \*insert department manager\* came up to me about the schedule and was like \*insert childish voice here laughing\* ""OP needs to take Sunday off to study"" and I told him ""Well SOMEBODY has to be here! It won't kill you just to work a day its not THAT important""  
I didn't even respond I just shrugged my shoulders and said sure.  
Manager: THAANK YOU

In that moment I just felt hurt, it may not seem like that big of a deal but at that point I had worked a lot of hours giving them all this extra time outside of my set schedule with no complaints. So yes. Having time to study for tests that make up 20-30% of my grade IS important to me. Especially since I'm paying out of pocket for these classes (payment plans are a blessing). I'm going to sound so whiny here, but I just ended up crying as soon as she left I honestly couldn't stop. After getting home I felt sick to my stomach and hurt. So out of hurt and desperation and stressful hope I could get some studying in. I called in that night saying I was sick and need some rest.

This was about a week ago, my manager never really called me out about it. I feel really guilty about doing this because my actions lead to my co-workers having to pick up my slack, which is shitty. But, after pretty much being an emotional wreck the day prior, what they said felt like everything I'm working for is a joke, it really hurt me. At the same time though calling in for that seems petty for something my manager said and probably didn't even realize it. (which this isn't the first time they've made hurtful remarks to me and even other co-workers)

In our first jobs in this industry we worked alongside eachother. It wasnt too bad. My only complaint for the year we worked together was that she told a manager I'd cover her shift without asking. Once the manager found out she hadn't actually asked me they always checked with me first.

When I got a job in a great company as a manager she applied and was soon working in my team. We worked together just fine. She didnt cause any drama but at the same time, didnt show the level of respect that other team members did. 

It's been 3 years since then and shes now a single mother living with our parents. She has a job but she doesnt enjoy it very much. In comparison, my husband and I have 2 kids and are very secure.

My husband and I recently brought a business in the industry and we inherited some staff but some chose to leave. Trace has asked me if she could come work at our company. 

There's no solid reason not to employ her given that we have worked together just fine before but I don't really want to. Shes always the center of attention at family gatherings whereas I am more reserved. I don't really trust her not to gossip about work to our mother, who she is very close to while I have a strained relationship there. She is also the type of 'funny' person who puts others down as a joke and I dont want my husband or I to end up as the butt of her 'funny work stories'.

I know shes family, and it's not like we are on poor terms. I just kind of want this business to be mine and my husbands, and not Trace's. 

Trace is understandably very hurt that I've said no. Her current job pays well and she's fine, but I know she would rather work closer to home and spend more time with her kid. Shes told me its incredibly rude and selfish to not even give her a chance, and that I could always fire her if it didnt work out. But how do you fire your own sister without causing an even bigger rift?

i kind of get this and i’m willing to keep it a secret for a little while, but i feel like he’s going to try to keep it a secret for as long as he can so his friend will stop ignoring him (he still talks to me daily though). i just think it’s stupid for us to be together if he’s going to be this worried about his friend being jealous. it’s not our fault he started liking me and while i feel bad, i don’t think it’s THAT serious to where we may have to keep things a secret for a long time. i told my boyfriend that i’m not going to hide forever. and that we’re either going to have to tell him eventually or just break up.

"This weekend, two of my friends [20m and 21f] are getting married to each other and I received an invitation and when they asked if I could go, I said yes. However, at the time i did not realize the details of the wedding.

Three years ago, I dated a guy i had met through a job that i had (this ex is one of the groomsmen). Through that friend group, I met who would later become a fairly long term boyfriend. The original guy had broken up with me (it was a bad breakup) and shortly after, my father suddenly died. 

This left me very emotionally vulnerable and i became really attached to my most recent ex, let’s call him Michael, who started to talk to and support me in a very difficult time of my life. Michael and i dated for a year and got very attached to each other very quickly. We then broke up because i really needed some space and i just wasn’t happy in the relationship at the time. I dated someone months later, but not for more than a few weeks and it wasn’t serious. Other than this, i rlly just took some time to figure myself out.

A year later, we started talking and decided to try again. However, this time Michael was often emotionally manipulative and untrusting, asking me where i was and just refusing to talk to me or suddenly decided to hang out with his ex that he had dated while we were broken up when i hung out with my male and sometimes my female friends (I’m bisexual so he was jealous of everyone).

Then i find out after we had broken up the first time, he told all of his friends i had cheated on him (i HADNT and he knows this) and absolutely trash talk me to him on the regular. His roommate called me a “fucking bitch” all the time and he was in a 40 person group chat with that would regularly make fun of me and he never stuck up for me. Once he even went so far as to say “lol” in response to my previous ex making fun of me. I broke up with him after realizing i had slowly lost contact with both my high school and college friends.

TL;DR

Anyway, turns out my ex’s roommate who hates me is the best man and my previous ex is one of the groomsman, as well as multiple other friends of my ex being the other groomsmen. I want to go to the wedding and take my male best friend that lives next to the church as support so i hav somewhere close to escape to if shit hits the fan. However, they decided to omit a plus one from their invitations. Is it ok if i just go to the wedding and bring my friend there and then not go to the reception?
I got them couple gifts off of their registry and they are aware of the strain between myself and multiple members of the wedding party. Thank you!

Edit: I had asked my friend the groom about bringing plus ones, he told me the reason they omitted plus ones is because paying for that many people’s food at the reception would be expensive.

c2drkk	2019-06-19 06:54:48	RSBennett	AITA for making jokes centred around my friends struggle with depression with him?	"I have this online friend who I play video games with, over the time we’ve been gaming together he’s become a pretty close friend and we message back and forth pretty much every day chatting, joking, sharing news and memes and the like. 

Turns out he struggles with depression. I’d kind of suspected due to some things he’d said in the past but never said anything, he seemed fine enough and I guessed he was working through it but these things take time, and not everyone likes talking about it. 

Recently he put a post on Facebook about it, saying he was going to work at it and try to get his life back on track. It’s great he’s now getting help and of course everyone jumps up to support him, including myself. After my message of support he messages me back thanking me, and thanking me for helping make things seem “normal” in the past while he was struggling through. Following this I send him a message saying “and of course I’m totally gonna make fun of you for all this, because that’s what friends do!” Not with any actual intention of making any jokes based around it, but it’s just a general joke very much in the vein of what we’d normally do. He messages back saying he wouldn’t want it any other way and we carry on and we carry on as normal. 

Fast forward to earlier today. I have a message from him asking if my wife and I ever got to watching any Game of Thrones. He’s a massive fan of the show and always encourages us to watch it. We have every intention to, but we have so many other things we’re in the middle of watching. I remember back to the thing about making fun of his depression and I send him something along the lines of “you already have depression, do you really want me breaking your heart and adding to it?”

It’s the first time I’ve actually made a joke around it and I kind of feel like an asshole about it. I get he said it was fine, and that he wants things normal, and normally we would make fun of each other over pretty much anything. But an ongoing struggle with depression feels kind of off limits.

He'll tell me that hes ""drained, and exhausted, and just doesn't know what to do anywmore.""  and the only thing I can think of is ""I can't do this. Why do I have to deal with this, again. Just get over yourself."" Obviously I know he can't do that and I try to help him as best I can, but there is always a certain bitterness to it, which I think he feels.

I don't know what to think. On one hand, he's my friend. These feelings don't get brought up very often, and I feel like I should force myself to help him more. Friends are supposed to be supportive and I don't think I am nearly supportive enough.

On the other hand, I'm not a therapist and I get drained so easily. I don't want to have him pull me down with him, and I don't want to have to deal with these things outside of the house as well.

It's kind of a ""one person to deal with is enough."" thing. And it makes me feel like a jerk."	No A-holes here	0	0
c2dksr	2019-06-19 06:31:18		AITA for trying to encourage my best friend to sign up for an ideal program at my Uni?	"Just a little background: my (F21) best friend of 10 years (F20), since completing Year 12 two years ago (in Australia) has since done nothing with her life. She hasn’t worked nor studied and is constantly at home playing video games and watching TV shows. She also suffers from depression and anxiety.

At the university that I go to, they have a program for people who want to try another way to gain entry into uni. Since she received a bad mark in Year 12, she was ineligible to study any degrees at a uni. However, this program seems amazing for her. She’ll only have to undertake 2 courses for a semester and then she’ll be able to study a various selection of degrees. One of which is a Bachelor of Arts which she has said really interests her. The program is free as well!

She brought up this program to me a few months ago before applications rolled out. She was very happy and couldn’t wait to start this program. I was so excited to see her excited.

But now that applications have started, she has been hesitant to apply for it. One of the reasons why is because she doesn’t want to take public transport alone to get to the campus, but because her mum works (my best friend herself doesn’t drive and relies on her mum), her mum won’t have the time to drive her to the campus. A train ride is less than 20 mins away from the campus, but she has said that she is scared of being alone on the train. I’ve offered to catch a train to her station and then we can go to the campus together but she has told me to just drop it altogether. I’ve asked why since she wouldn’t be alone with me, and she called me an asshole who doesn’t care about her anxiety of public transport.

I thought this program would be ideal for her, especially since she brought it up and was excited to start it. It breaks my heart because I just don’t want to see her waste her life in her bedroom. AITA for encouraging her to undertake this program? Should I just drop this idea?"		1	0
c2dk5p	2019-06-19 06:29:06		AITA for keeping my hobbies secret from my parents	"I am 27m currently living with gf (soon to be engaged). Now my parents (Asian parents) are known to be very protective and worrying towards me. I know all parents love to take care of their children, but my parents have shown it to a greater extent, jokingly confirmed many times by my relatives and family.

Now, since i've moved out i have had many different hobbies and interests that most parents wouldn't be fond of, such as tattoos and motorcycling. I work full time and i financially afford all the things i do.

My gf is quite open and not overly protective of me so she respects what i do. 

I haven't really opened all these things to my parents, though they know i have tattoos.

The first time i told them about my second (half sleeve) tattoo they went beyond livid and took them weeks to calm down, but i'm planning to do more tattoos in the future when the time's right.

I haven't told them i ride motorcycles because i know they will be snapped. There's **zero** chance they will allow me to ride motorcycles. But i just do because i moved out and i live my life with my own money in my spare time.

I want to be truthful but i think there are things that you don't necessarily have to.

However, I think she's recently crossed a line. She's been dating this guy for the past 2.5 months, not boyfriend yet but they have agreed to not see other people and sure seem serious. They've had a bunch of issues (he can't perform sexually and refuses to work on these issues, has been very rude to her, she's given him many chances) and she's decided to dump him. Good for her tbh. But he's on vacation rn, so she was going to wait until he was back to not ruin his vacay. Also fair. 

Heres where we reach the issue. She is also on vacation (in a different place than the guy she's dating), and met a guy she's been hooking up with. I called her out for cheating on the dude she's dating, since they did agree to be exclusive. She argues that because she's going to dump him anyways, it doesn't really count as cheating. Also argues that since he's been so awful to her/isn't a good person (? Idk this but it's what she says) that it doesn't count as cheating. I still told her that I felt it was wrong and that she was lying to herself to justify her bad decision. Now she's mad at me for being judgemental of her. So what's the verdict Reddit? Was I the asshole? I still feel like she's in the wrong, but I guess it doesn't make a big difference since shes gonna dump him anyways? Idk here"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2dd6r	2019-06-19 06:04:39	aknifeysituation	AITA for giving my goddaughter a knife in birthday present?	"Throw-away account just to be safe.

I come from a culture where knifes are important cultural objects. You get them at a early age to be able to carve wood, bones and antlers. I make knives myself nowadays in a traditional style.I am the godparent of a 10 year old girl and recently she celebrated her birthday so I gave her a knife I've made because well thats the age where you should get your first knife and I wanted to share this with her since both her parents and her have expressed interest in my culture and my craft.Her parents are not from the same culture as I and they were very angry for giving her a knife because it was very sharp (Sharp knives are safer than dull ones if she plans to use it, so I didn't want to give her a knife she couldn't use or would be unsafe to use later) and they thought I should have asked them first so that I could give them another present instead. My goddaughter liked the knife and I had planned to teach her how to use it to make cool things like spoons and animals out of wood but they don't want her to keep it.

AITA for not checking with them first that it would be ok? and for giving her something that can be used as a weapon? (addition: it isn't intended as a weapon and the blade is short but it can be used like that) Or for feeling insulted over this?

hope you understand my post this isn't my language

&#x200B;

addition: Thanks for all the answers! I should talk to her parents about it. I think it was a misunderstanding perhaps between us since they have been involved in my culture before. Perhaps I get a bit blind when it comes to knives and how they are perceived in other cultures :) Can perhaps keep the knife at my home and I can teach her how to use it here since she wants that. Hopefully that Isn't rude to suggest to the parents."	No A-holes here	0	0

c2dcbv	2019-06-19 06:01:54	roommatesreallysuck	AITA for calling the police over my roommates' dog?	"I live with X, Y, and Z. X and Y are a couple who have a dog named R. R is sweet but loud. However, a few weeks ago, it seemed like X and Y purchased a collar or did some type of training that curbed her barking.

&#x200B;

I'm a music teacher and on 6/05 I hosted a trial run of a Glee Club at the house. Z offered to take R out so my students wouldn't be distracted. I was very appreciative, though given the recent trend with R's barking, I didn't think it would be an issue. Unfortunately, when Z and R returned, R barked so much that some of the moms complained. Z asked what I would do next week if no one was around to take R out. I said that I might let R outside in our fenced backyard (with water of course).

&#x200B;

The next day, a message is written on our white-board telling me to ""act like an adult"" and not to touch R. Y also sends me a message on facebook saying that he will call the police if I do anything with R.

At this point, I felt like I had to go to the police to find out if X & Y had any recourse against me. They reassured me that I am within my rights to let R outside or cover R's kennel with a blanket (this has been effective at keeping R quiet in the past). An officer also let me know that X&Y can be given a warning for R's volume. Fed up with the way this situation was unfolding, I agreed.

This is the first time he communicated to me not wanting blankets on R's kennel because she eats them.

Y blocks me after I post the bills for him to inspect.

&#x200B;

X & Y are very angry about the warning they were given and are under the impression that R is not loud. They also believe that I ""filed a false police report"". Here is a recording I took on 6/15 of R: [barkbarkbark](https://soundcloud.com/user-968051631/barkbarkbark). This was taken in my room with the door closed.

&#x200B;

Y owes me over $100 in bills and still hasn't paid me. So I change the wi-fi in an effort to urge Y to pay. I come home that night to the chain-lock on the door. X and Y are inside snickering while asking me for the password. Eventually, they let me in and start fussing over the wifi. I always ask for the previous month's bills at the start of the new month. They have not paid for June's internet but feel entitled to it. We are arguing in circles and I go to my room. I hear a loud BANG and come out to see a decorative box of mine thrown across the living room. Ten minutes later the police are knocking on my door because X called them claiming I was the one who threw the box...

&#x200B;

I don't think that giving them a warning for R deserved such an insane reaction. What do you think reddit? AITA? This post had to be shortened due to the character limit. Will happily post additional details in comments."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2dban	2019-06-19 06:01:04	dog-love-	AITA for not inviting my other friends to hang out?	"So I have a pretty solid friend group (8 people in it) from college. We would all hang out at least once a week to eat and just spend time together. Within the group, I really only talk to two of them outside of when we have our group hang outs. Let’s call them 1 and 2. 

1 is my best friend and roommate for 3 years. Everyone in the group knows that we are pretty much always together and are super close. We saw each other pretty much everyday. I am super comfortable with her and don’t feel the need to be “on” whenever we hangout. I can just relax and not have to worry about anything. 
2 is another close friend that I talk to and would just have regular conversations with. I probably saw her once or twice a week in college and I also lived with her for 1 year. 
My relationship with the other girls are also good and we all have fun together but I just don’t talk to them as much as 2 and no one comes close to 1. 

Well it’s summer break and 1 and 2 and another one of the girls (3) live in the same city while I live an hour away. 
1 just got back on vacation so I haven’t seen her in a month. 
We all made plans later this week to hangout and celebrate 1 and 3’s birthday. 
1 and I also made plans for today because we just wanted to hangout with each other. So today I drove over there and we just spent the day together. We didn’t invite the others or let them know that I was coming. 
My reasoning was that I just wanted to hang out with my best friend. I didn’t feel the need to invite the others if I didn’t want to. For me, hanging out in a group can be tiring and I feel that I need to exert more effort to make sure that everyone is having a good time. With 1, we could literally just be in other’s company not doing anything in particular and it would be fine and there’s no pressure to talk or anything. I don’t have to worry about anyone being bored. 

Well today while we were out, we decided to visit 3 at work since it was literally right next to the restaurant we were at. We thought against it initially but felt that there was nothing wrong with me and 1 just hanging out. Anyway, 3 was surprised but happy to see me and wondered why I was there. We just chatted and that was it. She didn’t ask why I didn’t tell her or anything it was just a good and fun conversation catching up. But 3 sent a Snapchat of me and sent it to our group chat. 2 didn’t reply to it or anything but I do assume that she was upset that I didn’t tell her I would be in town. 

When I got home my family asked me why I didn’t also hang out with 2. They felt that I should have at least invited her since we’re friends. My point is that I shouldn’t feel obligated to invite other people to hang out even if we’re friends. Every time I hang out with a friend it doesn’t need to be some group thing.

My birthday is this week. 

My friend messaged me two weeks ago and she asked me if I had an account with her favorite restaurant, after saying I didn’t she said to make an account asap. I didn’t because I don’t like that restaurant and I told her that. 

Nothing else was said about it until today when she asked me again. She said you get a free food item for your birthday and that’s where she wants to take me. 

I didn’t know what to say because I usually try to avoid confrontation, and I also didn’t want to hurt her feelings. 

It was hard to think of what to say because I was also annoyed. Because she knows I don’t like that restaurant, and she also knows that I don’t even like the free food item. 

Last year for my birthday she gave me a bag that had some free samples that she had received in the mail. It wasn’t anything special and I was a little disappointed but I was still appreciative because nobody really ever gives me anything. For her birthday I gave her a basket of stuff. So I thought this year I would get a real gift. That’s not why i gave her the basket though. My love language is gift giving. 

But I feel like it’s not really a gift. Going to her favorite restaurant and getting something for myself that’s free that I don’t even like isn’t how I want to spend my birthday. 

I replied to her and I told her that I didn’t want to go, but I appreciated her thinking of me and wanting to take me. And ever since it’s just radio silence from her, which is unusual. 

I didn’t want to offend her or hurt her feelings but I feel terrible now and think that I was wrong.

i am having some struggles regarding my sexuality and feeling comfortable about having sex or not, so i recently reached out to a friend to talk about it. however, my significant other is a very private person, and does not think that our sex life, OR lack thereof, is anybody’s business. she has said in the past that she thinks it’s uncomfortable and strange for people to talk so openly about their sexual relationships. 

i’ve always stood by that, however, this struggle with my sexuality recently led me to finally break down and vent to a friend, mainly to ask for advice. so i did talk about our sex life and my concerns regarding it. my friend is a very sex-positive person, so this was in no way taboo to her and she was just there to listen and give advice, not judge.

however, my significant other found out (we occasionally go on each other’s phones, not for any trust issue reasons, it’s just something we do) and got very upset that i was sharing information that involved both of us, not just me. she said that she didn’t want this person to know about this part of our relationship and that she now felt uncomfortable and upset. we are currently in a very tense atmosphere. 

on the one hand, i really felt that i needed advice and to vent to someone outside our relationship. on the other hand, i understand her feelings regarding privacy. AITA?

(She knows because I kinda complained about how tired I was from it) 
Anyways... she’s got kids, and work, and other crap, needs the car... Well I get a call today from her pleading that she really needed my help. That I’ll get paid back within a month. Promises promises. 

Problem being, I don’t want to wait a month to get the money back. I was planning on buying plane tickets in the next few days to get away next month. Well, I told her that my money was tied up for that, and she got very upset. Told me that I’m the only one in a position to help her, and she’d do it for me....Except I’m not a person who asks for much. Only the occasional dog sitting when I’m out of town, and I pay people for that help. But none the less, she was really emotional when she hung up on me. Crying about needing help and me being selfish. 

I’ve lent this friend large amounts of money before, in the past. She has always paid me back. Maybe not all of it. But most of it. I’m not a  nickel and dimmer when it comes to her. She is my oldest friend. I do kind of feel bad. But I also work really really hard to afford what I want to do. And I want to get away. I’m going through crap as well.

c2d6o3	2019-06-19 05:48:08	Helen_Tossaway	AITA for losing patience with my troubled sister?	"Resubmitting to follow the rules.

My 15 year old sister admitted to me yesterday that she's been stealing a lot of money from our parents and other sisters. In her defense, I think it's mature of her to be honest at all because nobody knew she did this.

 She told our parents and they came up with a plan to be there when she tells the rest of the family to reassure them that my sister will take responsibility.

My sister is super upset and anxious that my parents decided not to tell them today. She just wants it all over with. She texted me and seemed to want sympathy for her position and this is where I may have been the asshole.

I told her to suck it up and that feeling heat over this just shows how serious this is. If her stealing got worse and she started stealing from stores on the military post she lives on, the military police would be involved and it would be a million times worse than if she stopped stealing now.

She has a lot of mental health problems but I'm frustrated that I have to tell off a 15 year old for stealing. I'm frustrated that my entire family is walking on eggshells around her but I'm worried that losing my patience with her will discourage her from being honest in the future. I feel like she has to start growing up and realize that mental health problems don't excuse shitty behavior.

c2d5zn	2019-06-19 05:45:40	confusedparent2	AITA for using my daughter’s college fund on her sister’s tuition	"My husband and I have 2 daughters 25 and 22.

This past May my 22 year old graduated from college. My husband and I got her a brand new car. My other family members were very generous. Several gifts including, helping her find a nice apartment, one person promised to pay for first months rent and another the security deposit, a gift card for furniture shopping, surprising her with paying for her trip to Europe (she already planned on going but she was going to be on tight budget) 

The trip to Europe was apparently offensive to my 25 year old. When she graduated high school and had wanted to go we denied her. We felt that she was too young. At the graduation party she was pissed when her sister got the free trip to Europe. I tried to explain that the situation was not comparable. She’s been so resentful of her sister since then. 

Since her sister returned from Europe she’s been openly hostile. We were talking about her sisters new job and when she found out she was going to be making 90k a year. She was pissed. She ranted that the only reason she’s making that is that she stole her college fund.

There was no theft. Their college fund is my portion of the money a relative specifically designated for my kids college tuition. When she chose not to go to college. The money was used for her younger sisters Ivy League tuition. Truthfully that was the only way we could have afforded an Ivy League education without loans. 

She wanted to take a gap year after high school. She wanted to travel to Europe with her irresponsible friend. We felt that the 2 teenage girls traveling independently was not a good idea so we refused to pay for it. She was annoyed but she got over it. 
Her gap year turned into 2. And whenever we brought up college or Careers she said she was fine with her current job and college wasn’t for her. That was when we decided to use her college fund for her sister.

As recently as last year my husband asked her about going to college or trade or what ever she wants to do to help her make more money. We were willing to pay for a state school or online classes but she said she was happy with her situation. She does have a lot of extra money because she lives with us rent free and only pays for her car and phone.


Now she’s been hostile to everyone. She thinks that we favored her sister by giving her the college fund. She’s also annoyed at the amount of gifts her sister got for graduation and especially the New car and Europe trip.

My husband and I feel like we gave our children equal opportunities but she disagrees. Are we the assholes in this situation?

**edit**

Someone asked for how much my daughter makes. My oldest daughter makes about $14/hour. She doesn’t and has never paid rent. Before this May she’s been perfectly happy with her situation. If she was to be living independently like her sister she would be miserable. Only because she would have to work at least full time and would barely have spending money. Currently she doesn’t work full time and doesn’t get insurance. So we pay for that too.

College isn’t for everyone but my husband and I want her to be an independent adult. 

As for the trips. In my opinion 18 year old girls are too young to be going to Europe on their own. I would certainly not pay for it at that age for either of my daughters.

My younger daughters college graduation trip has been in the works for at least 2 years. She’s worked and saved for that it. Most importantly she’s not a teenager and she’s going with 3-4 other people. Also my brother and his wife decided to pay for the Europe trip as their graduation present.

Giving gifts like first months rent and deposits are pretty common in my family. I can almost guarantee that if my older daughter was moving/planning to move into her own place she would have received the same gift."	Asshole	0	0
c2d5p6	2019-06-19 05:44:38		AITA for not being available for my mom	"Basically I see my mom every day, we live together and we see each other every morning before work for a few hours and after work unless I go out (usually don’t).

The thing is she needs to constantly hold a conversation. Like from the second I leave my room she will expect full-on banter. There have been times she hears me waking up/starting the day in my room and will yell down to me (I live in the basement) and expect to have a full blown conversation. If she goes in the bathroom she will yell through the bathroom door.

Our house is pretty small so it’s impossible to walk away, plus I feel rude. She doesn’t have any friends or anyone to talk to so at first I went along with it and sat around with her for a while before work, it’s been about three years of this now and it’s really exhausting to me. Plus I feel like it’s hindering our relationship a lot when I have to tell her to let me relax to myself for a few every single day. I feel like it’s fair. She requires a lot more interaction than I do so I talk as long as I can and when I feel drained I try to excuse myself. I have explained this to her and she says I don’t like her and don’t want to talk to her ever.

 It’s mostly complaints though, she will complain about financial issues/other members of the family/anything possible from the second I see her until I literally say “mom that’s enough for me right now”. I’m 21 and support her financially and really can barely
handle my own stressors without getting depressed. There are other people in the house, I feel like she specifically targets me because she is passive aggressive and wants to see me get overwhelmed to start bickering. Today I told her I got a bug bite and she followed me around for 45 minutes asking if I thought we had bed bugs, telling me to go get bug spray, random stuff and repeating herself multiple times. 

I’ve started letting her talk without responding much and that helps a little but I usually end the day feeling like a huge jerk and wanting a more normal relationship with her.

However, my mom had started reconsidering going to this place with me. She wants me to spend the first few days with her and a friend from high school. Overnight and all. I have no desire to do this and it will take up half the time that I am there from what it sounds like.

c2d3ks	2019-06-19 05:37:11	HTSlippy	AITA for ending a friendship through someone else?	"Towards the beginning of my sophomore year of highschool, me and a senior girl (G1) became friends, and our friendship quickly grew pretty close. I had a small crush on her, but was too afraid to admit it to myself, so I just called her a friend. However, I had a crush on another girl at the time (G2), but she had a boyfriend so I had no chance. One day me and G1 decide to hang out alone for the first time. I told G1 about how much I liked G2 and she told me that it likely wouldn't work out, but I was stubborn, so I disagreed (I was a dumb sophomore)

&#x200B;

Eventually I officially had a crush on G1. We became EXTREMELY close, even started flirting. But it came to a standstill for me when G1 got a boyfriend. I think, ""This sucks, I should've said something sooner."" A week later I try to back away from her, not wanting to chase ANOTHER girl who already has a boyfriend. G1 notices this and asks me what's up, and I admit to having a crush on her. She sends a NOVEL over text telling me about how she's in love with me, how she never wanted to say anything because she knew I liked G2, and how she wanted to kiss me the night we hung out (which, again, was our FIRST TIME hanging out alone). This all shocked me, I was a sophomore who barely had any girl experience, so having A SENIOR tell me they loved me was terrifying, but I kept quiet and continued our friendship

&#x200B;

Back in school we're at lunch and I go sit with some other friends that day to discuss a project (up until that point I had been sitting at G1's table). I head over to G1 towards the end of lunch to talk, and she's furious, asking ""What's the REAL reason you left me?"" I explain to her that I had a project to do, I didn't have much of a choice. This only got worse. Over the next few weeks she starts manipulating me to talk to her and being possessive, and being far more open about her drug abuse problems (which before then I had no idea was a thing). She even broke up with her boyfriend FOR ME. It was all too much, so I told her I wanted to take some me time. She ignored this, texting every day trying to talk to me. The stress became unbearable until eventually she asked if we were even friends anymore. In the kindest way possible, I said, ""No.""

&#x200B;

She stops texting me for a while, but eventually sends a text trying to reconnect. Stupidly, I reply, and the surge of messages comes in. The stress comes back and I can't take it anymore.

&#x200B;

So I did something that deep down I regret doing, but feel was necessary. I text a friend of mine and I ask her to tell G1 to back off. And she did, she stopped texting me, in fact she blocked me on everything.

&#x200B;

It felt bittersweet, like the ending to La La Land but with emotional manipulation instead of music. Part of me is glad it ended, but sometimes it sucks to think about. To this day I can't decide whether what I did was right or wrong, especially with how close I was to her. Am I in the wrong?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

In our first year dating, I would do random bits just to see if it sticks. For example, I would call basket, baskoot and mosquito as masquaito. Her family would always ask me why I talk like that and I would say that’s how we talk in my country. I kept doing it to the point where my girlfriends little brother started genuinely talking like me. 

One time, I decided I wanted to make her think I’m colorblind. I started off slow, like when we were in the supermarket and I started calling this tomato sauce orange, and she’s like “dude that’s bright red, what do you mean it’s orange?”and I’m like oh whatever, right? I’ve kept that up and just saying random stuff that’s wrong. 

One day, she approaches me and tells me that she thinks I’m colorblind, and I played it off like she’s crazy. But she was consistent, she had this picture which is like a bunch of orange yellow and green circles and if I didn’t see a number, it basically means I’m colorblind. She asked me if I see a number and even though I see the number 42 or whatever, I told her that I can’t see anything, she was so shocked, and I kept telling her that there’s nothing there, I played it off as if she pissed me off and that all of this was a prank which isn’t even funny. 

So 2 months ago, 3 years after the prank started,  after all the acting I’ve done, and after purposefully failing all her colorblind tests, I told her that I wasn’t colorblind and it was all a prank. She didn’t believe me at first so she started reassuring me saying that it’s okay if I’m colorblind and she loves me no matter what. I had to literally point at everything at the kitchen and say the color, I did it for a week. She started crying her ass off since she finally believed me, she left the house and is now living with her family and says she needs a break from my nonsense. She eventually came around but it’s still a touchy subject believe it or not, like she thinks everything I do is a bit"		1	0

c2d1t0	2019-06-19 05:30:45	Momof2andalittlemoos	AITA for not telling my husband that my daughter is sexually active?	"I’m on mobile and it’s super late, I apologize for any formatting or errors.

A little backstory: I have been with my husband for 9 years, 7 years married. My daughter is 16. I wasn’t always the best mother when she was a young child and we did not have the best relationship. With years of therapy we have gotten to a really great place. She tells me things and confides in me. She wouldn’t tell me the day of the week it was before. 

She had dated a boy about a year ago and she lost her virginity. (My husband knows about this) She told me right away that it happened and I talked with her about safe sex and not having sex with anyone just because they have a penis. She has very bad periods so she was already on birth control to help manage them.  They broke up not long after. 

She started dating a boy about 5 months ago. I’ll refer to him as B. About 3 months ago she came to me and told me that they had had sex. I asked her if they used a condom, she said yes. I also went and got condoms for her to have so there is never the “I don’t have protection, you’re on the pill so it’s ok” line.  I thanked her for coming to me and being open and honest. She asked me not to tell my husband. Which I totally understood. No girl wants her dad to know her sex life.  Plus he would have flipped out. 

I didn’t think much of it and everything has been fine until a week ago. I get a call from my husband and he is beyond livid. He looked in her phone and seen a message that she had sent to B about condoms. When he asked my daughter about it, she said yes they are having sex and that I knew. He proceeds to tell me that I am wrong for not telling him. I told him that she told me in confidence and I wasn’t going to breach her trust and that girls don’t want their dads knowing that stuff. 

He told me that I’m selfish and I only think of myself. I told him she is 16 do you really think it wasn’t going to happen at some point? I said that I’m glad she came to me so I can make sure she is being safe and has access to protection. I also told him that I told my mom things that she didn’t tell my dad. Again I was told that I’m selfish. 

I really didn’t think I was wrong for not telling him, but now I’m questioning it. 

AITA for not telling him and breaking my daughters trust?

EDIT: he is her step dad. Her bio dad knows that she is sexually active. My daughter told him not long after she told me."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2d0i7	2019-06-19 05:26:22	DogsAreCooluwu	AITA for wanting to defriend my boyfriend’s best friend?	"I use to be friends with friend (F) years before meeting my BF, he was the one which actually set us two up. We use to have a wholesome friendship and I considered him a close friend. He use to date my old bff, when they broke up, he became mentally unstable. I stayed by his side caring for him as he was in a dark place and needed some help. Throughout that time he lied and manipulated me which upset me, but I just chalked it up to him being not all there as the break up was really bad. He luckily got better and was able to start dating again.



Fast forward half a year, F would only ever talk to me about how to hit up girls & what girls are like, as I’m the only girl he’s friend with without pursuing romantically.  When he finally got a new partner, he rarely spoke to me, it upset me. It felt like because I was a girl and he had another girl to talk to, he didn’t need to talk to me anymore. He would also sexualise girls a lot, which made me uncomfortable as I have a lot of problems mentally regarding the topic of sex.



Half a year ago, I decided to end the friendship, as for around 1 1/2 years he NEVER spoke to me, even when I tried, it felt like he never would talk if he had a girlfriend. I felt used and ashamed, I truly thought he was a friend. I tried to talk about this with my BF, but he came off like I was being silly and overdramatic, & wouldn’t take my feelings into consideration. It would upset me when I saw BF talk to F, and I even caught them once mocking me. As earlier stated, I have a lot of mental problems regarding sex, so It’s a very sensitive topic for me, so I’m terrified my boyfriend speaks about this topic with F.  It also feels like BF talks to F more about our problems, more than he does with me, which really upsets me as how am I suppose to work on our problems when you don’t tell me what they are?



BF tried to rekindle our friendship again, and F and I spoke once or twice in a month. However, last week, F asked me to watch a deliberate episode of a show, which was about ‘two college roommates being stuck in a video game’ saying it was directly BF and F & that ‘you will know why it’s us two when it happens’. I thought it would be a wholesome silly show as the boys are nerdy silly boys, so I trusted him. Turns out it was very sexual & the two boys ended up having sex & cheating on their partners, it really messed me up. I still feel upset about it to this day. 


I want to end the friendship again, he crossed my limits & upset me, however if I speak about it with my BF he will think I’m being silly & will most likely brush it off and try & make me forget about it.

c2cyxq	2019-06-19 05:20:31	LeanerLee	AITA (M27) Caught Feelings for a long-time Friend (F23) and told her at a Bad Time	"I've got a good friend, Mel. We worked together a few years back and have stayed in touch. At the time we were both in relationships so it was easy to be friends. 

**Mel calls me one night to tell me about a guy who didn't understand consent. They had sex, and in the middle of the night he tried again, she said no several times, he kept going. She was very upset and told me she was cutting contact with the guy. After that we hang out 3-4 times per week.**

Then I caught feelings. Figured should be honest, so decided I'd tell her on Friday at lunch. Calls me Thursday. She's pregnant from ONS, needs a lift to the Doctor, my feelings can wait. There was a delay, it took 4 weeks, instead of the usual 1. Only I, another friend and her manager knew. 

Eventually she gets the procedure, the female friend accompanied her to that. A few days later we were off to get lunch, and I planned to tell her. When I picked her up she was in pain, we spent the entire day in the hospital. I feared losing her.

10 pm, Mel's healthy and being discharged. I asked her if she wanted me to stay over on the couch or take her to her friend's place. I didn't want her to be alone.

Then she tells me she's staying with Will. Will is a guy she's been seeing for 2 months and never mentioned. It's also the same guy who hadn't understood consent. Mel wouldn't hear anything negative about him. I was exhausted and relieved that she was okay and didn't say much. She ghosted me for a week. Then invited to some drinks, at Will's place. I drove her and some workmates to his place. On the way Mel said ""Will knows you don't like him, but I've told him that you're too important to me for him to not get along with you"".

He greeted us shirtless, he was trying to look intimidating. Mel was embarrassed. The workmates were giving him banter, she was defending him, asking them to be nice. The guy workmates all thought he was a dick. But Mel was happier than I'd seen her in weeks. So I decided to keep my feelings to myself.

The next day I text her saying I was happy for her. After that Mel was texting and calling just like before.

On Monday, they went official on FB. I scrolled through the comments, and it was clear that everyone knew they were dating the entire time (except me) and No one knew he assaulted her (except me). I acted emotionally. I sent her a text explaining that I had feelings for her, how long I’d felt that way and why I hadn’t told her. I wasn't trying to break them up, just needed to get it off my chest.

She didn't know what to think. Asked for space, told me that she still wanted to be mates but also didn't want to hurt me.

We haven’t talked since, but her last exam is Saturday, so I wouldn't expect a reply before then anyway. • AITA for not telling her sooner? for ruining their ""official"" day? for catching feelings for a friend? • Is she TA for not telling me they were dating?

c2cxys	2019-06-19 05:16:59		AITA for yelling at my cousin for wasting my beer?	"So I went out and bought a case of some Southern Tier Brewing Co. lake shore fog beer. It’s my favorite IPA in the galaxy next to snakedog by flying dog. I digress.

This beer ran me about $17 for 12 beers. It’s not cheap shit. And I was excited to drink it. 

My cousin is a person who likes to talk about the alcohol he drinks and enjoys, but in reality wastes a glass of whiskey because he can’t get past the chest burn. So in my eyes I’m slightly at fault for letting him take a beer.

He takes it, cracks the can open, and sips it. Exclaims “this is delicious! It doesn’t even taste like beer!”. Anyway, he takes like 3 or 4 more sips, and sets it down on the table. Then lights a cigar and doesn’t touch it for about 30 minutes. He gets up, takes the beer with him and says he’s taking a piss. 

He comes back with no beer, so I asked “what did you do with the beer?” 

He said to me as casually as can be “I dumped it”

So I looked at him and said “you can’t be fuckin serious with me dude.” He was confused and figured he did nothing wrong so I said to him “every time we drink you waste alcohol. Whether it be beer, scotch, vodka, whatever it is.. you’re wasting it. If you don’t like the taste of alcohol  then stop drinking it. This shits expensive and I’m not letting you waste my money. The beer was still good, I could have finished it if you didn’t want it.”

He understood, I told him I apologized for yelling at him, and I explained I was simply tired of drinking with him because all he does is waste his shit and other people’s shit. After that we finished up the night with some laughs and good cigars and forgot about it."		1	0
c2cvtp	2019-06-19 05:09:56	DielLima	"AITA for ""stealing"" my bff's car when he was drunk?"	"This is very long, sorry. TL;DR at the bottom.
So, this happened a couple months ago, one of my friends was having a bday party and everyone drank until we couldn't even stand straight anymore so no one was smart enough to realize maybe bff shouldn't drive. But when my bf suggested we should go to a bar we all just went with it.

My bff drove way over the speed limit, and I got kinda scared but we arrived safely at the bar. But then the bday girl called us, and told us that we had forgotten to take one of our friends. We were so drunk we forgot a human being.

So, we all got into the car again and went to get her.  On our way to the bday girl's house my bff started to drive way faster, and then he hit a couple in a motorcycle. The girl flew and hit the windshield and it shattered. The guy fell into the ground. After talking to them they seem fine, no serious injuries, just some scratches. My bff freaked out but made a deal so they wouldn't call the cops on us. He gave them 180$.

I told my bff someone else should drive now and the others back me up, but he was angry and still very drunk and told us to shut up and to get in the car. We did it but me and his brother were trying to convince him to stop and let someone else drive.

We got there and my boyfriend and my bff went inside to get our other friend. My bff's brother talked to me and we decided I would drive and we would convince my bff to go in the back. So I got into the driver's seat and told the others to lock the doors (I had a bad feeling about this plan). When the others came back my bff realized what we did and he yelled at us and wouldn't listen when we told him to get into the back seat. He threatened to brake the window, my bf held him and I drove away.

I went to my bff's house and when we got there he and my bf were already there (they got a ride). When I parked he got up and started to hit my window and screamed at me, calling me every name on the book. Before I could go out he pushed to the ground and entered his car and parked it inside and came back. He threatened me and my bf stopped him until his parents got up and took him inside. I went home and when the adrenaline got out of my system I started crying realizing what happened. 

He didn't talked to any of us for nearly a month but then he started talking to the others again, but he never reached out to me. I felt like we owed each other and apology, so after months I reached out to him. I told him I was very sorry and missed him a lot. He told me he accepted my apologies even though they were very late but maybe we could work it out. He never apologize to me so, was I the butthole this whole time?

Edit: I did realize after the fact that I made a mistake driving being intoxicated, but my stupid self thought that was smart at the time.
TL;DR: I stole my best friend's car because he was drunk and crashed into a motorcycle, so I thought he shouldn't drive, but he got mad a me and thinks I'm the only one on fault."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"TL;DR: My partner has put off working on a project that's due in less than a week, when I've been trying to start it for 2 weeks now. I've done a majority of the project; all that's left is to take what I've written in the google doc and organize it into a 2-3 page paper. I've told her multiple times I'll be away camping the 4 days leading up to the due date, now she's upset that I won't be around to write the paper at a time convenient for *her*. I've suggested several times to write it together, but she has declined all offers. I asked her to write the paper and I'll add to it when I get back, but she told me I was ""trying to get out of writing the paper."" I told her I won't be working on the paper at all while I'm away.

6/3: We were assigned a 3 part project: create a detailed program for persons with autism, make a powerpoint, and write a 2-3 page paper (double-spaced). I told my partner that I would be away camping June 20-23.

6/10: I created a google doc so we could collaborate on the project remotely.

From 6/10-17: I add as much info as I could find, writing up notes for everything we need to address, leave comments for her input, etc. She doesn't open it until 6/17 and apologizes for not looking at it until that date. I remind her I'll be away, again, and tell her that tomorrow (6/18) I'm going to use the day to work on it if she's available. She tells me she has work, but will work on it at night...spoiler: she doesn't.

6/18: I use all the info I find to develop the program and write up all the necessary components to the project. I text her giving her the heads up to check it out to see if she wants to add or change anything, and to let me know asap so I can throw it into powerpoint. She instantly gives me the go-ahead to create the presentation (she never looked at it, I was still on the doc and didn't see her), so I do. I text her after I finish the presentation and she responds with ""What are we doing about the paper?"" I tell her if she wants to work on it, all she has to do is take what I wrote and organize it into a cohesive paper. There'd be VERY little she'd actually have to come up with on her own (intro, transitions, closing) if she wanted to just copy what I wrote. She tells me we're partners and should probably work on it together (I wanted to make a comment SO bad lol), so I suggest tonight, tomorrow before class, or the morning it's due, 6/25. She tells me she can't tonight or tomorrow, and Monday is cutting it too close (understandable). I ask her if she minded writing the paper because it's not like I haven't pulled my weight, and told her I'd add to it when I get back. She made a sarcastic, half-joke/half-serious comment about me trying to ""get out of doing the paper."" So I tell her I don't what we should do, because I won't be working on it while I'm away, but asked for suggestions. She's read the message but hasn't responded,"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2cu1c	2019-06-19 05:04:03	Muted_Juice	AITA for telling my sister why I don't want to have children?	"My parents had me (now, 32M) young, then had my little sister when I was 13. My mom passed 2 years later. My dad, while present for most of my life, had never really contributed and my mom took him back despite a lot of bad stuff he did. It was no surprise that a lot of care fell to me when it came to my baby sister. I was juggling school and her, eventually a job because Dad lost his. A little after I graduated from high school, my dad got arrested. I was 18, so I was fine, but my sister was obviously too young. She faced being put in the system and I had a choice. I knew I’d never get to see her and I had to give it a shot, so I got legal guardianship. I had already pretty much been raising her.

It was just us after that and of course it wasn’t easy. I couldn’t go to college and I worked two jobs at a time to keep us afloat. My sister was a good kid, but obviously she struggled with not having traditional parents (even when our dad got out, he never came back for her and that was hard). I did everything I could to make her feel safe, secure and protected, but half the time, I felt like a kid too, because I never really got to be one.

That lead to another thought in my head. While I wouldn’t change raising my sister, it did take away my youth and chance to be a free young adult like my peers at the time. I decided that she would be my only “kid”. Which meant I had to find a partner okay with that. When my sister was in her teens, I met my now wife. She was great with my sister, who didn’t need a mom but loved having a female figure. We got married the year before she graduated from high school and assured her, our home is always open to her, and she stays with us during breaks. She graduated from high school last spring and goes to a school out of state. I miss her a ton, but it was time for her to spread her wings. We talk, text and Skype.

Since she left, we’ve traveled and I have plans to go to college in the fall, a lifelong dream. The only thing that’s changed is we’ve discussed fostering in about 10 years but my wife also doesn’t want babies around. My sister recently started poking around asking when we’d make her an aunt, and I said we had no plans to do so, explaining our plan. She got curious and I explained for myself, I raised a kid and now I felt like I was an empty nester, ready to live my life a bit. I knew instantly I had hurt her feelings and tried to explain that I wouldn’t change raising her. She said she understood and hung up, but later admitted that around the time the wife and I got married, she felt guilty for being around so much. Now, she feels like she ruined my life. Not true!

My sister told my best friend who is like another brother to her (my only friend who didn’t abandon me when I got custody) and he is pissed at me. I feel awful that she’s so sad, but I didn’t think that was so wrong. Was I an asshole for saying that? My wife says that I could’ve worded it a lot better, because she would’ve been hurt too.

&#x200B;

ETA: People have said I should reach out to her, I have tried to, several times. This did just happen yesterday so she's naturally still hurt and not willing to listen, but she will be coming home from her roommate's (she was on vacation visiting) on Friday, so I do plan to have a sit down talk then if she won't answer my calls or texts before then. Considering just writing an e-mail.

Edit 2: People have been calling my sister ungrateful and that's seriously bothering me. She's not. She is very much grateful and aware of what I did for her. It's \*why\* she feels this guilt. I think if she didn't...then I might even think she was ungrateful."	No A-holes here	0	0
c2cu02	2019-06-19 05:03:56		AITA for telling my friend I want space and casually fading the friendship	"So me and my friend (both in our mid 20s) were planning on taking a trip to Europe in December. She’s thinking about advancing her career and wanted to start applying for grad school. Initially, we were gonna go in January when tickets were like $500 but then it changed (because of her schedule) to after Christmas ($800), which sucked. That’s still a lot of money for me but I was ready to make it work.

During the initial conversation,even before we changed dates, she called it off because of finances and her car breaking down, which I understand people got bills (this was like two months ago). But then three weeks later she said she was 100% down and she found the money. 

So here’s the problem, she’s canceling on this trip once again, so she can go on a vacation with her family in December (and this time I think it was a final No).  She said she just couldn’t see herself enjoying the trip bc she couldn’t do everything, so why spend that much money to go on a trip to Europe. She even asked to reschedule it in March but January/December was my only free time.

I’m the type of person that doesn’t expect a lot from people & doesn’t get their hopes up often bc shit happens, that’s life. She is one of my closest friends and i cannot process this disappointment especially since she got my hopes up so much after the initial no. I’m definitely the type of person who cuts people off, not on petty whims (or I try not to), for my own piece of mind. So would it be bad for me to just ask for space from her while it try to “get over it”. Would it be okay if we never got the close again, do I even owe her anything?  AITA if I just wanted to just fade the friendship?



TLDR; I wanna ignore my friend while I try to get over her canceling major plans with me. Life happens, but I hate when people get my hopes up and then cancel the whole thing."		1	0

c2crau	2019-06-19 04:55:31		WIBTA if I went to see a movie with another guy without telling my pseudo-SO?	"Alright so, some context first. Last December, I started dating a dude from my college, let's call him Harold. We clicked immediately upon meeting, started dating within a week, and had several months of a relatively good, happy relationship. And then, due to a lot of complicated reasons, we broke up in March. However, it made us both extremely sad and we ended up getting back together about two weeks before the semester ended and we both went back for summer.

We decided mutually to keep things casual over the summer, and apparently casual to him means that we've barely talked and haven't even spoken on the phone once since we left college (it has been well over a month).

About the movie thing...I used to work at this burger/bar place in my town, and for the first few weeks of my working there, I was trained by this dude, we'll call him Karl. Karl and I got along really well, and I really enjoyed his sense of humor. I was 16 at the time, and he was 18. 

Fast forward two years, to recently, and we ended up matching on tinder. (I don't use tinder for hookups, I just get bored and find it interesting to talk to random people. I never would cheat on Harold, even if we are 'keeping it casual'). I always swipe right on people I know, since I use it to talk to people and not to hookup, but I was pretty surprised that he matched with me.

Now, I'm a fan of John Wick, but I haven't gotten to see the third one yet, so out of curiosity I put on my tinder ""who wants to go see John Wick 3?"" Karl was the only one that responded, expressing interest in going with me. 

So, let the judgement fall. WIBTA in going to see a movie with Karl, when he doesn't know that I'm in a relationship and we reconnected through a dating app? Is this a bad thing to do to Harold? I would ask Harold about it, but I'm kind of afraid to talk to him, our relationship has been so complicated the past few months and I don't really want to figure it (our relationship) out virtually, and I feel something like this would open a long and complex conversation about what we want. Plus, Harold hangs out with random people all the time and never tells me about it, so...

I would never cheat on Harold, but I really wanna see John Wick and this is the only person who's expressed interest in going with me."	Not the A-hole	1	0

c2cnmg	2019-06-19 04:44:02	Isimarie	AITA for feeling bad when my sister and my parents argue, and feeling like I’m being treated unfairly in general?	"My parents are constantly arguing with my sister. It’s been going on for about 3 years and it’s not getting better.
My problem is that I have no escape from the situation. They’re so loud, that even when I close my door, I can still hear them. Loud screaming, crying on my sisters side, and doors slamming. I get it’s probably hard for my sister right now because of puberty, but I still can’t stand it. It just makes me feel terrible having to listen to it.
What especially bothers me is that they still do more for my sister than they do for me, I know it’s a hard phase for her right now, but they weren’t there for me when I had hard phases, and they still aren’t now.
For some example of stuff they do:
My mom stays up with my sister, sometimes past 2am,  so my sister can go to sleep before my mom, because my sister sleeps better that way. My sister is 13 (ongoing 14 now)
They always listen to my sister and give her empathy about what’s happening in school.
With me, I used to get bullied (I was around 12 yo then. I can’t go into any detail else it’ll be removed by an auto moderator) and I told my parents, they just told me to get over it. Whenever anything happens I’m just supposed to get over it, or they say I’m over exaggerating.
Am I over exaggerating?
I talked to my mom about me feeling like this, and she just said I have no right to feel bad about the arguments, since I’m not in them, and that I’m overreacting about their behaviour in general. She said I should be thankful for what they have done for me instead of complaining.
She won’t be convinced otherwise.

c2cnhc	2019-06-19 04:43:38	throwthrowaway2990	WIBTA for arguing with my mom?	"I'm  Indian. My family is Indian. I was born and raised here. My mom was  not. My dad ditched us when I was a baby and is currently remarried with  two other kids. He's around, but not around. I'm 29 years old. My mom  is 55. Essentially, it's just me and her.

She's  been starting the conversation of me getting married. It's the  traditional 180 that most Asian parents do with their kids (NO DATING,  NO WOMEN for most of your life, then a switch flips and they want you to  get married and have babies). I'm fine with that, I've always wanted to  get married and have kids with the right person. The issue that's  coming up consistently though is that I don't care if the person is  Indian (specifically the same type of Indian as us apparently since she  got pissy when I set up a date with a Hindu girl). In fact, I think I  would prefer a non-Indian.

My  goals: I want to support my mom like she supported  me. I want to get into med school or PA school and have her retire and  live a happy life like she deserves after the constant shit that life  has thrown at her and that she protected me from. I have lived a  privileged life thanks to her efforts.  I want to be able to marry  someone that will support me and work with me towards whatever goals we  set up, and is a personal match to me. To me, it seems idiotic to look only at Indians (most of which I've never gotten along with in life) for  a partner. I want the freedom to ""look everywhere"" for a person that  will fit with me. My mom isn't having this. We're constantly arguing  over this and she's saying things like the reason some of my cousins  aren't allowed to hang out with me is because I game and wasted tons of  opportunity in my life that was given to me (I have a master's degree, I  haven't been very successful at getting into med school because I have  trouble with standardized testing over long periods of time, basically  the MCAT) and they don't want their kid to be 'infected' and that  they've said this to my grandmother who let my mom know. Or that my  uncle + aunt (essentially due to family dynamics and age, my brother and  sister) would leave me later in life and all my cousins will ostracize  me if I date/marry a non-Indian-like-us.

My ex cheated on me (a lot) 4 years ago and it's really  taken me some time to get over that. I feel like I'm ready to get back on the horse, so I set up a date with a cute girl in my pokemon go community, but she's not Indian. It's not very serious either. I have no idea if it'll work with this person.

I don't want to marry a person I don't get a long with or that I'm  not attracted to (Real talk, I'm not attracted to indians or indian  culture). But I don't want to lose my mom either since she dropped the  ""I'll just start getting ready to move out and live in two separate  households"""	No A-holes here	0	0

When she told me she is trans I got behind it immediately. I referred to her with the correct pronouns privately and used her chosen name for a full year before she came out. I fought for her when members of our family rejected her and I would and have immediately cut anyone off if they are in any way hateful towards her. 

When she came out she was embraced by many but rejected were loudly by enough people for it to be absolutely devastating. As a result we became very close and spend much more time together than we did before. 

Now, for the shitty part. Ever since she came out she’s been getting progressively more annoying. She FAKES stupidity, like will actually put on a 2000’s style Paris Hilton ditzy act. She’s taken up cattiness that she never ever had in her before and just recently I caught her pretending not to know how to put windshield wiper fluid in her car. Like, she actually created this whole scene where she was confused and needed help doing a task I know she can do because she taught me to do it when I got my license!

A cousin eventually said something to her which resulted in a lot of tears and her calling that cousin transphobic (i know he’s not but he did come on really strong telling her that she was being fucking annoying) so I know that I have to tread very carefully.

Now I’m wondering if this is just kind of like her going through the same self discovery I went through as a teenager and it will pass? I don’t know if me breaking down for her how her new found identity is irritating as shit is any help if this is something she grows out of herself. I honestly don’t know what to do."

We tried an open relationship thing, it was a last ditch effort . In the final 3 months, I could tell he was distancing himself from me emotionally. So I assumed he fell for someone else. He confirmed it the day of the break up. I wasnt able to end it just yet.

My granny had a bad fall on Thanksgiving. She died within the week.

I begged him to come to the funeral.
We are Vietnamese Buddist and had a funeral everyday for 5 days before the burial. He refused to go to any of them. He said he had to work. There was a differnt excuse each time. He did work a lot, over 60 hours. So I let him be. 

I thought, ""If my parents died, I dont want to have to beg him to come to that one."" 
So we broke up before Christmas. We agreed to stay friends. I asked him to do me one favor, which was not to have to meet his new bf for a loong time.

Okay heres where my friends come in. 10 years ago, they meet and each confide in me that the other is cute. I play match maker. They hit it off. They are the truly the 2 sweetest people I know too. Flash forward 9 years, they are engaged. They rented a home for themselves which had too much space. So they invited me and my then-bf to live with them. 

A year later, they watch the breakup happen. One month after the breakup and 5 days after my Grandmothers 50day memorial (Buddhist thing). He brings his new BF home. I freak out. I tell my roommates I need to move out. They tell me, that night, that they won't renew their lease.

I cant disentangle my sorrow for Granny from my anger at my ex. I feel one, I feel the other. I tried to forgive him, but its harder when he acts like he did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he went from distant to 100% upbeat. And Im mad at him for that too, because he couldnt do that for me while I was mourning. Now, I cant even stand to see him in a happy mood. Ive cut contact, and my friends have to find ways to work us both into their lives without us meeting. He is fine with hanging out, I am not.

My best friends' wedding is in December. Im sure we are both be invited. My family will be honoring her death in December as well. I dont think Ill be over it. Ths bride asked me to be the florist for the wedding. That much I can do. 

But Im very much leaning towards declining attending. Im afraid Ill get emotional and possibly make their big day more difficult, as they would worry about how we will interact. 

I mean, clearly this post is more about him than them. Im trying to find the balance... In May, I assumed I had mostly moved on because I had just stopped thinking about Granny every day. But then one night remembered that the only Vietnamese I ever managed to teach my ex was ""Hello Granny."" So she would like him. She was the first to support our relationship. I cried for 4 hours. I don't think I can be that mature person, 6 months from now.

c2cjjg	2019-06-19 04:31:41	KneeDeepInArthritis	AITA for flipping off a customer?	"On mobile so sorry for typos and formatting and what not.

It started like any other day working at a hardware store, busy busy busy mornings. We had to drop 300 2x8x8's from an overhead shelf with a forklift for a customer who had a large order, 160ish boards. We took them outside to load them, goes smoothly, but then we had about 140 leftover  which i took back inside, and just to preface this next bit, when lumber is stacked high its pretty unstable, so you put spacers between the boards every so often to help stabilize the stack. 

So im on my way back in with my stabilized stack, spacers just sticking out of the side, and this customer jokingly goes to rip out one of the spacers which would in turn drag boards off the cart, changing its balance, and potentially causing much more to avalanch off. To top this off he makes a *yoink* sound effect. Im flabbergasted. What an absolute man-child, I think to myself.

I take safety very seriously, its essentially an operating warehouse with customers dispersed throughout. Needless to say I'm fuming, he could have caused hundreds of pounds of lumber to fall on him and other customers walking just behind him.  I resisted chewing him out in a crowded store making a scene, but I admit in the moment it got the better of me, I gave him the meanest look i could muster and a middle finger which another customer commented somewhat disapprovingly on, saying something to the effect of its just something i have to deal with, so I should deal with it.

I know I'm right to be mad at someone endangering others and potentially causing an immense mess, but am I the asshole to display that anger to them the way I did?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I had been dating this guy let’s call him Cam for about under 2 months. We had broken up due to him not wanting to see me  as a distraction wanting to focus on his future and school knowing that to get what he wanted he would have to put less attention on me which would’ve just left me hurt, so he decided to end things. 

This hit me very hard as I had fallen head over heels in love with this guy very quickly. The relationship was still new and I expected so much more from it so it all just left me in a weird spot where I had no reason to dislike him which made it difficult to get over him. 

We went our separate ways but we decided to still be friends. Not even 2 days after we had broken up a very close friend of his hit me up he had yet to know about the break up so I told him he later in the conversation asked me if I wanted to FaceTime him. Me not seeing anything wrong with this I agreed. We talked and he tried to comfort me then he got to asking me questions about the sexual relationship I had with Cam. Cam and him are like brothers so I still heartbroken just trying to find ways to cope thought nothing wrong in trying him. I now see that what I did was very immature and I shouldn’t have done that but the past can’t be changed. 

Fast forward to yesterday Cam texts me which I was taken aback from as he had been pretty distant around campus. He asks me what happened between him and his friend that he has told him everything mind you I was under the impression that his friend wasn’t going to tell Cam as he repeatedly said that “What happens in this call stays in this call” which was complete bullshit. I was completely honest with him apologizing as well. He appreciated my honesty but said that due to the fact that I did that he would never consider getting back together with me and granted that broke my heart since I’m still not really over him. 

I’ve spoken to my group of close friends about the situation and they all think Cam is the asshole as what I said I said outside of the relationship so he shouldn’t take it to heart but this has just left me confused. I still think I’m to blame though so am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

My friend and the others fly over at the end of May and look for a house to rent for June, July and August. In that time we exchange a few texts and long story short he tells me they found a house which is about 20/25 minutes from the city center.

I text my friend and ask him how hes getting on and about the house. Im told everything is good and that the house is in a great location but its a bit “pricey”  Thats ok theres 12 of us the rent cant be that high?. Later he sends me a figure and tells me this is how much Im paying when I arrive.  Surely theres been a mistake? I ask what it pays for and he says deposit on the house, utilities, house insurance and rent. Im perplexed as to how it could be so much with 12 people staying there, the house isnt anything spectacular from what Ive seen

I inquire whether this is for 2 or 3 months as I think he has factored me in for 3 even though he knows Im coming on the 26th. He tells me that its for 3 and that Im paying for the rent and utilities bill for the entirety of June. Which is an extra $650+ than what I had previously thought. He goes on to tell me how “its not that much”

 Im taken aback, I tell him I was sure I’d be paying for the time I was actually there, and paying for the full 3 months throws my funds up in the air(Were college students so money isnt plentiful to begin with).
I say I thought I would be paying for the 1 week of June and the other 2 months including the utilities, deposit and insurance. Im told thats not the case.

I tell him Ill happily pay for the week Im there and for July and August. As well as utilities FOR the entirety of June, the deposit, the house insurance and Ill even pay my share for any appliances or furniture they bought for the house(which wasnt mentioned). 
He tells me no, that its unfair that I should just “stroll” into the house while they spent, “a months worth of rent” on airbnbs during the 9 days they were house hunting and went through the “hassle” of finding a house. Which I normally would be empathetic towards but:

1)I wasnt able to be in the country at the time
 
2) They didnt include me or ask my opinion on which house they were going for or tell me the prices until after they were already in it

3) I didnt force them to pay so much for airbnbs, or go to the country in the first place without housing 

4) They couldve stayed with friends

My friend then says hed told me previously that Id be paying for the whole month of June even though I was coming late(he 100% didnt, I checked our texts to before he even left) and that it wasnt fair for me to pay “significantly less” than the others despite him telling me it wasnt “that much”money to begin with.

Next morning comes and she says ""if you want food you can take my car to the supermarket - I won't be able to drop you home until after 2pm"" (disclaimer: I do have a car - irrelevant circumstances meant I didn't have it with me). 

I hate driving her car because she is crazy about it, but i need food, so I take the car, and accidentally kerb the mag on the back left tyre.

The car is an expensive VW, some special edition her dad bought her. I come back, tell her what happened, apologise and offer to pay.

Her solution is to contact the most expensive possible place it can be repaired (the VW dealership) which will cost 2x more than anywhere else. On top of this there was already existing damage to the mag from over a year ago that she chose not to repair. This was damaged by someone else who did not admit to it or offer to pay.

Am I an asshole to:

Ask her to go somewhere cheaper?

Just pay the cost that it would be if she did go to a reasonably priced repair location?

c2cdze	2019-06-19 04:14:53		AITA for essentially uninviting my mom to my graduation after she told me she would rather watch the livestream than view it in person?	"I was supposed to graduate high school today (Tuesday) but it got moved to tomorrow (Wednesday) because of the rain. There’s a high chance it’ll be moved indoors if it rains tomorrow too, and since it’ll be raining pretty much all day I’m assuming my graduation is inside. This means I have three tickets to watch it in person, while my other guests have to watch it live-streamed in a different room at my school. 

I don’t live with my parents. My mom has this boyfriend that I’ve never gotten along with that well, and even my relationship with her is a little “meh” for lack of a better word. She’s bringing her boyfriend “Jack” even though I didn’t necessarily invite him but whatever, she can bring him. 

I plan to give my mom, dad and aunt a ticket to watch it. This means my boyfriend, sister, cousins and Jack would be watching the livestream in the other room. However she doesn’t want to leave Jack alone...? She told me she would watch it in the other room because she didn’t want to leave Jack alone. Even though he’d have the rest of my family, including my sister he knows well (sister lives with mom and Jack). 

I essentially told my mom it wasn’t worth it to drive this far to watch a livestream in another room when she could watch it from home. I think she’s mad at me now and took it as me telling her not to bother coming. But I feel as though this is my graduation and she’d want to see her daughter getting handed her diploma IN PERSON.

c2cdd5	2019-06-19 04:13:05	hermione_cho	AITA for hoping co-worker’s family emergency was due to their Uncle	"I feel like I’m the asshole about why I hope my co-worker got called away because of their um ...Uncle? She related to a celebrity that has a every well known  history of supporting some bogus beliefs and being very vocal with them. 

Now in the last couple of years I have hoped that something very bad would befall on their uncle. I doubt I’m the only one. Especially not over the attacks he lead against victims. Or the countless other  harm he has down with his words and action.  I wished that it there would be a chance to take him down big time. 

So when l heard their excuse of family emergency last week my mind jumped straight to their Uncle. I was a bit giddy over the possibility. Plus because their uncle is making national news and the time of the call I think that my wish might have been grant. Basing this on the news I think my wish did happen but that wish for a taken down was no where near this current scale; I was just hoping he would be silenced. 

I do feel guilty to a degree because I would not wish this co-worker any pain over their family members. 

So am I the asshole for wishing something horrible to to happen to their uncle?


Edit: To clear things up I am not wishing for anything physical to happen in terms of harm."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c2care	2019-06-19 04:05:03	ElSanDavid	AITA for going to the mens room	"  So I was at my local chipotle when I suddenly had the urge to go to the ol’ throne and that’s when I notice there’s a line for the womans restroom (there was one room for one person) and the mens was occupied (I am a man).

So I wait there and the line in the womans restroom goes down until there’s only one lady left and that’s when I see a lady coming out of the mens room. I think nothing of it as no men were waiting so I go in right after her and the lady waiting in the womans room shoots me the dirtiest glance I’ve ever recieved. 
   
Later on when I was eating my meal I noticed her pointing at me to the group of people she was with. Am I the asshole for going to the mens restroom instead of letting her go ?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c2c9yn	2019-06-19 04:02:51		AITA for telling my little brother to stop talking during the movie?	"So my little brother is 8, and he has an annoying habit of talking during movies. It's usually not a big deal *but* he always talks about the movie and says spoilers. 

Tonight we were httyd (the last one). My brother had seen it with my grandma when it came out, but I haven't yet. 

Just a few minutes into the movie, my little brother starting talking about the movie, so I said ""hey, little bro, can you be quiet so I can watch the movie?"" he's quiet for a few minutes. My mom wasn't in the room then, but when she came back, my little brother started talking about the movie again. So I said ""Little bro, seriously, I'm trying to watch it."" 

My mom told me to shut up, and let him talk, completely spoiling the movie for me. I got up and left, and my mom called me a baby and an asshole. 

What do you think? Am I?"		1	0
