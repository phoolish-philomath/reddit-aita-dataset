c3ywar	2019-06-23 03:59:59	wannabeaspicegirl	AITA for not attending my friend’s wedding and going on vacation instead?	"TLDR: friend off and on since kindergarten is getting married and I am going on a European vacation instead of her wedding. AITA?

Back story: I’ve known this friend since kindergarten. We were inseparable until 9th grade then didn’t speak for 12 years. She became popular in high school and I didn’t so we lost touch. It always hurt my feelings, but I never told her that. During those 12 years she made a new core group of friends that did everything together. Since 2014 our families have spent every thanksgiving together. She and I would hang out once a month or so and Snapchat/ Instagram stuff regularly. 

In January she got engaged. The night she got engaged her fiancé had a surprise engagement party planned with what she described as all her “close friends.” I wasn’t invited...

Also in January my boyfriend and I decided we were going to utilize my Christmas vacation to go to Europe. We didn’t have tickets booked, but we had plans to go 12/20 to 1/4.  I requested the time off of work and everything so the plans were in motion. 

In February she sent out the save the dates for her 12/28 wedding in Florida (we live 1,000 miles north of the wedding location). That’s right in the middle of our planned trip and inconveniently close to Christmas and New Years so flights are outrageous. 

We booked our tickets to Europe instead of to Florida for her wedding. 

I priced it out hotel and flights for a long weekend in Florida is the same as two weeks in Europe (hotel and flights).

 I’ve felt like a secondary friend to her for the last 5 ish years. I didn’t think she’d be upset. 

I was wrong. I told her in person and she joked it off saying she was just going to go on an exotic vacation when I get married. Later that night she text me how I hurt her and that this damaged our friendship. Complete with a broken heart emoji. 

I feel terrible. Her text made me cry so hard. I had no idea it would upset her that much. My flights are nonrefundable so there’s nothing I can do. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3yrrv	2019-06-23 03:46:06	drivingmishap2019	AITA for getting a refund from a company that tried to charge me extra fees?	"Going to do my best to fit this in the word limit, sorry in advance.

I lived my entire life in a dense city, where everything was within walking distance. So I never learned to drive. Upon moving somewhere that cars are a necessity, I tried to learn how. But due to my own panic disorder, it proved to be difficult to practice without help, so my mom offered to pay for a $300 driving class set for me. It would be three classes, each worth $100 (you could buy 1, 2, or 3 classes). We chose this company specifically because the driver would pick you up, with a list of approved cities on the website. This was perfect since he could pick up from both my place and my mother’s place, since at any given time I was at either one.

The first class I was picked up from my place. It went okay. The next class was scheduled a few weeks later. The day before the next class, I texted the instructor to let him know I’d be at my mothers house the next day, so I’d need to be picked up from there. He responded no, he wouldn’t pick me up from anywhere but my place, otherwise I’d need to pay a $50 cancellation fee. I pointed out his website said my mother’s city was one of the areas he picks up from, but he said he didn’t want to drive that far (it was a ten minute difference) so I had to cancel. 

Annoyed by this, I said I wouldn’t pay extra money since I didn’t want to cancel, he had no rules stating I had to be picked up the same location every time, and if he didn’t want to pick me up from there we could just reschedule. He again said I had to pay him $50 to change anything. His website only says if I need to cancel I pay $50. He was being very hostile (capslocks, insults, etc) so I said to just refund me the two classes and I’m done. He said no, no refunds. So effectively, pay him $50 to access my two unused classes, or lose them entirely.

Since I used paypal to pay, I filed for a refund. After some back and forth, paypal said they understand both sides. They initially sided with him, but after I pointed out I never cancelled, he did, they realized I didn’t do anything against his policies. They refunded me $150- letting him keep his $50 fee from me, but giving me the remaining unused $150. I wanted my entire $200, but I wasn’t going to fight it and take what I could get.

My mother and I are going to put that towards his competitor company for driving lessons, and my mother wants to slam him on yelp. AITA for this situation? WIBTA for leaving a yelp review to watch out for him charging fees that arent listed on his policies?

Edit: The reason I think i may be TA is that after his initial “no” to changing the location, and me pointing out his policy about pick up locations allowed, he told me (in his hostile message) that he scheduled two classes back to back, and the class before mine was close to where I currently live. I personally don’t think thats my problem- he should give himself ample time between classes to get to each location. I don’t think he should force me to cancel and pay him a fee because he doesn’t want to be ten minutes late to get me. That was his entire argument during the paypal dispute, that my location being different than he expected meant I deserved to pay the cancellation fee. Paypal ended up with the compromise since the class did get cancelled as a result, even though that was his call not mine."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3yrbo	2019-06-23 03:44:45	hannibe	AITA for cockblocking my dad?	"Sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile. 

So, I’m a 19 year old college student home for the summer, and it’s been jarring being back home because while sometimes it feels like I never left, other times it feels as if I’m a houseguest overstaying their welcome. Today when I was eating breakfast my dad asked me to vacuum, to which I replied “ maybe” . Now, I probably should have just gotten up and vacuumed, but for some reason I didn’t, and few hours later Dad walks in SCREAMING angry about me not vacuuming. Now, if you know my Dad you know that 98% of the time he’s a wonderful human being, but on occasion he just explodes in anger: cursing, screaming, throwing things, he’s never placed a hand on any of us but when he’s like that always scared that this time will be the time he does. Well anyway, he storms out of the house to get lunch ( part of the reason he was angry was because my mom didn’t get him a burger while she was out) and I decided that if he didn’t want to see me slacking off he didn’t need to see me at all. I took all of my stuff from the downstairs, upstairs, including the only working stapler in the house which happens to be mine, all the while complaining to my mom about how unwelcome I’ve felt lately. A little while later, my dad calls me from downstairs to explain why he was angry. The first reason was that I didn’t vacuum, but the second was that apparently I “ stay up late downstairs” and he can’t have sex with my mom. For the record, I ALWAYS go to bed before him, and he’s usually passed out in his lazy boy anyway. He tells me that I talk to him all the time about women’s health care and birth control( current events in the US and issues that matter to me as a female)  all the while not letting him have sex. So AITA for this? Because to me that seems like a deeply fucked up thing to tell your child.

c3yqss	2019-06-23 03:43:11	Rickoversghost	AITA for having a fight with a minor and his friend and pursuing charges against them?	"Background:

I got a dog on the advice of my therapist a few years ago. He isn't an ESA, although he does help me quite a bit. I am a veteran that has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and severe anxiety, he has helped me immensely since we've been together.  I try to take him on walks daily to get both of us exercise, we walk the same route most days.  He means the world to me, and is in my post history.

A few weeks ago a kid in a car threw a pizza crust out of the window of his friends car while we were walking down the street on the sidewalk. He said ""Hey man!"" a second before he threw it and I looked up and bonk, right in the forehead!  Nice aim really.  No worries, they are kids, I'm kind of mad but I will get over it. I keep walking, and don't think about it for a few days.

A week or so goes by and I'm walking my dog again and the same car rolls around and the same teenage kid yells out ""Hey man!"" except this time he throws a bottle of diet coke on the ground in front of me and it explodes. I stop and just glare in the direction of the car because there really isn't much I can do. The kid hangs out the window laughing and pointing. A random person comes up an says they saw the whole thing and I get their information. Apparently useful in a bit.

Last week I was walking down the same road, it's a main road in my town with a sidewalk, and the car shows up again. I bring my dog close to me so I can protect him if anything gets thrown out of the car. It turns out to be another coke bottle and this time it hits my dog in the head. He doesn't care, he's a dog and it's not that big of a deal to him. However I yell at the car to ""GO F\*CK THEMSELVES"". The car stops and the person who threw the bottle and a friend from the back seat climb out.

An altercation ensues in which I ""win"". One of them is unconscious on the ground, the other is hurt and back in the car, I have a cut above my eyebrow and some bruises.  The police and ambulance show up, take the one kid to the hospital, the other is checked out and is fine. I get questioned as to what happened as do other witnesses and released a few hours later (my statement is corroborated by the witnesses, like the one from a little while ago). They are both charged with assault charges and left to go home with their parents.

The kids parents have found me and said that they are sorry and want the charges dropped because they are just kids and don't want this to follow them in the future. I tell them no. I haven't spoken to the prosecutor yet, but I think they should face the penalties for what they did. I will not back down and want them to suffer the consequences of their actions.

Some people that know my situation have called me an asshole for wanting them to go to jail, and ruining their lives apparently, but I think they deserve it. Am I the Asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3yq8k	2019-06-23 03:41:21	kittencrumbs	AITA for finding an apartment and moving out before my roommate found a place?	"Background: I moved in with my then-boyfriend into a studio apartment in a very expensive city on the west coast. 6 months into living together, we decided we were better off as friends and have continued living together peacefully with some minor bumps along the way, mostly because we had signed a year lease. Neither of us could afford to live in this apartment on our own.

Now it's a few months past the year lease, and we're now month-to-month. I'm ready to move on and have been casually dating. It's difficult to explain why I'm living with an ex in a studio apartment, which led me to decide to find somewhere else to live. I'd finally have my own room with some privacy. I told my roommate two months ago that I've begun looking for an apartment. Each time I went to go view an apartment, I told him ahead that I was checking these places out. Those few didn't work out. 

Last week I viewed another apartment and it was promising. Cool roommates, nice apartment. I told my roommate that it's highly likely that I'll be signing the lease. The potential roommates decided that I would be a good fit for the apartment and I agreed to move in. I told my current roommate that I'll be moving out and that we should talk in detail about the logistics. We couldn't even do that. He began to give me the silent treatment and gave me very short responses. 

Turns out he never bothered to actively look for a new apartment. He casually browsed, but never reached out to any listings. Now he's saying that I'm the asshole for ""throwing him under the bus"" by not working with him to decide on a definitive date to move out before looking for apartments. The housing crisis here is ridiculous. My reasons for not doing so was because I didn't want to find myself at that date with no prospective housing. It made sense to me to first find an apartment before deciding on a move out date. Since he's on vacation up to the middle of July, he now needs to scramble to find a new place to live by August. I'm moving out the first week of July AND I'm paying for next month's rent at the studio on top of the first month's rent and security deposit for the new apartment. He's so upset with me that I genuinely don't know if I'm the asshole here for doing things the way I did."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3ypbk	2019-06-23 03:38:40	nightmarejellyfish	WIBTA if I ghosted a clingy friend?	"I have a friend at school that won’t give me my personal space. He had, and possibly still has, a crush on me, and he expresses it by always wanting to be around me and know everything that is going on in my life. He gets angry if I walk somewhere without him or don’t tell him why I’m in a bad mood (which, honestly, is usually because of him).

I don’t feel like I could civilly tell him we need to part ways without him dragging me back into this, what I would consider to be, toxic friendship. I’m on summer break currently, so we don’t see each other as much as we would during the school year. I’m thinking about just completely ghosting him once school starts back, but that would also mean cutting off other people I cherish since we share most of our friends.

He’s also not the most emotionally stable person. He has said I’m the only reason he hasn’t killed himself, but also that I’m going to be the reason he kills himself. Recently, he has accused me of being abusive towards him. It’s emotionally draining on my part.

I have a great time just going to restaurants by myself, movies by myself, and spending time reading books by myself. Meanwhile often times,  my family members just want to spend time with me and though I love them I just prefer to be alone. I like the solitude. Same thing with my friends.

c3ymn6	2019-06-23 03:30:37		AITA for dating my cousin's ex?	"I'm trying to figure out if I'm an asshole because my girlfriend's ex is my cousin and I still don't have the nerve to tell him. We've been dating for almost 2 years so he obviously has some clue at this point, but I just don't talk about her to that part of my family. 

Part of the reason I was too much of a coward to tell him is because he was always 'competing' against me in school when we were growing up since we're the same age. I know our families compared us a lot, especially his, which probably built up resentment against me. But even in later years when I was visibly struggling, his interactions with me still always felt superficial. He never even talked to me about his dating life before. When I did reach out to him during his breakup he left me on unread. 

My girlfriend and I got to know each other better in college after they broke up since I was honestly really lonely in highschool and she was one of the only friends I had who went there.

He would obviously feel hurt or like I was getting at him if I dated his ex. If it wasn't such a gradual progression between my GF and I, as in the beginning we felt we just weren't allowed to date, I would have just asked him. But it's way too late for that and now it feels even more awkward when we talk in family meets. Like we both know what's going on but can't say anything.

My own family ridiculed me for even talking to her still and told me I had to stay away, so I obviously lied about our relationship for a long time. I had a lot of drama unfold when they figured out what was happening.

And now I obviously have to talk to him about it, but everytime I found myself alone with him I just couldn't bring myself to even mention her name. Would I be an even bigger asshole if I sent him a message over text explaining everything?"		1	0

"So, my stepdad has this hobby where he walks into rooms we're in and **shouts** ""HEY!"" or ""WHAT'RE YOU DOIN'?!"" in his loud, deep voice, just to scare us. He likes to see us get scared and then calls us wussies for being scared. He also has a habit of nagging, being insensitive, favoring the middle sister (an entitled brat), and being a well-rounded douche.

&#x200B;

One day, he crossed the line and accidentally made me spill hot water all over my feet (and the rest of the kitchen) because he did this while I was washing dishes. Not even a ""r u ok?"" came outta his loud mouth. He just waddled away, probably to do it again to one of my unsuspecting sisters. I was severely pissed off from the pain (they got burned), so I sprinkled some salt in his coffee and lunch. He won't be back until morning, but now I worry that he can't eat his lunch. He works long hours, so I feel pretty bad that I ruined his only meal, but I'm SO sick of him purposely terrorizing us like that. I thought maybe it'd show him how I feel about him being a bag of dicks...but now I think I'm the bag of dicks."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"Okay, some background to my living situation...I live with my boyfriend and his family. I'm 25F, boyfriend is also 25, and his younger brothers are 15 and 17. The two share a room and my boyfriend and I sleep in the living room because we don't have anywhere else. So privacy is pretty scarce. My largest pet peeve is having someone who isn't me or my partner sitting or laying our bed. The 15 year old brother is a high functioning autistic with Aspergers and he doesn't pick up on social cues and doesn't really grasp the concept of personal space. Hes also at that stage in his life where he doesn't exactly care about his hygiene...so he stinks and is pretty grimy. He's constantly been taking naps and occupying the space that is my bed and it bothers me to no end.  Especially after I come home from a 12 hour shift at work and hes already passed out on my bed! 

TD;LR: AITA for having a problem with my boyfriend's younger brother laying/sitting on our bed? Because I feel like I cannot voice my opinion about it because the younger is autistic.

A work friend who I meet 1-2 times a week for drinks invited me to their housewarming party. I didn’t know any of their friends and made the mistake of showing up just after the start as people were still coming in. The party was on the roof of a large apartment complex. I decided to bring along a guitar as I’m fairly good at it and it serves well for an icebreaker/entertainment/awkwardness cure.  In case that wasn’t enough I was gonna fall back on the tried and true social lube of booze.

I get there and make the usual small talk but can’t seem to get into an actual conversation. They all know each other but don’t know me. So I sit down at a large table we’re around and start  drinking and playing. After about 20 ish min there is a decent audience and we start talking. We pass the guitar around, chat, a lot of them are from the same company as me, in general it’s a good time. 

A while later the group has grown, I’m 4 beers deep and figure everyone gotten to the party by now. So I start asking how they know my friend. Dead stares. Know who?.... turns out my group had moved while I was playing because my music drew another group and some randos.

"This situation is really blowing up my personal life right now, and it’s causing a lot of heartache. I (19F) live with my dad and stepmom (50s M/F). When I was 10, my mom died of pneumonia brought on by autoimmune issues. It was a shock, especially because my parents had a traditional marriage. My mom was my dad’s “helpmeet,” and she and I did all the housework and women’s tasks (I also have two older brothers). My dad got remarried really quickly, and I think it’s because he was kinda lost without my mom. 

Now, my mom always made clear that I was to have the same type of life as her. After high school, i would marry a strong Christian, have a large family, and become a helpmeet. I would remain under my husband’s umbrella of authority, and I would teach my daughters to be good mothers and my sons to be warriors for Christ. I went to Christian high school, and I didn’t question that stuff for a long time. 

Now that I’m an adult, I’m losing my faith, and I’m starting to feel that this lifestyle is kinda sexist and not for me. I want to be a nurse and work outside the home, but my dad is pressuring me to start courting a boy from our church. He and my stepmom say that going to college and staying single would betray the dreams my mom had for me. Given that she didn’t get to achieve her own dreams, they feel like I owe it to her to obey.

Some small backstory: my time zone is EST. my dad left the house at 9PM to pick up my sister from work or the gym (idk where she went) When he came back home to drop her off, he left again without telling my siblings or I where he went off to. He came home 10 minutes to 11pm. 

I'll put this out here, my siblings and mom don't trust my dad because he has cheated on my mom countless of times (idk why she's still with him). So me being the nosey person that I try not to be, went to my dad's room to ask him where he went. This is how the conversation went down: 

Me: ""Hi dad, where did you go???""
Dad: ""I just went out to get some fresh air.""
Me: ""For almost 2 hours?""
Dad: ""Yeah I drove on the freeway. ""
Me: ""You drove for 2 hours? Where'd you go? ""
Dad: ""Stop asking me these questions! I parked somewhere! ""

And with that I said okay and left. A few minutes later my dad walked into my room and started yelling at me because of it. Then my brother defended me and said ""she just asked where you went for the past 2 hours. What's wrong with that?"" Then my dad started yelling at my brother, then my sisters got involved, and then I wished I never asked anything in the first place. But the question I have is that if my dad didn't go out to fuck another women then why did he get so defensive when I asked?

c3yk9f	2019-06-23 03:23:22	RefusingToHelp2	AITA for refusing to help my co-worker lose weight?	"I have worked at a small-ish company for about a year now.

I'm kind of known as the gym rat guy at work. While I don't compete in bodybuilding events, I take pride in the steps I've made in the gym and how I look. I've helped a couple of my co-workers with their fitness before as I generally want to give advice to anyone in need of it.

So six months ago, when one of the women working with me asked for help, I obliged of course. For this story we'll call her Cathy. Cathy is in her late 20s and obese. She came to me one day asking how she could shed some pounds and what diet I was on. Since it was a slow day with not much to do, we talked for about an hour about CICO, training for body composition, and the importance of strength training. She was really into it and thought it would be super fun.

The next day I saw her eating a box of doughnuts. It's not for everyone so no skin off my back. 

A few months later, she came up to me again asking basically the same line of questions. I told her again how to do it, and said that she should try to find something that she enjoys exercise-wise. At this time she asked me some frankly annoying questions, like ""do you think I could lose 30 pounds by summer?"" or ""can I be a size 12 by my sister's wedding in November?"" She really envisions herself losing weight and looks only at the potential result, not the process.

Predictably, she made no progress. If anything she has gained weight in this time.

So about a week ago she came up to me again and asked the same questions. I told her I was kind of busy and blew her off. She came up to me again a couple of days later and started asking if she can lose 5 pounds a week. Again, I just kind of shrugged and said ""maybe"" and blew her off again.

My household/family is me, my mom, stepdad, and two brothers. My biological father is/was an abuser; I left when I was 18; because I'm the oldest, my younger brothers still see him regularly, per the custody schedule, but they aren't treated nearly as badly as I was, being the oldest and only girl. Everyone agrees on everything up to this point.

What is disputed is whether my needs are actually being dismissed, or whether I'm being unreasonable. I moved back home, as I said, and my room is in the basement. I'm taking summer classes online and will be commuting to school in the fall and spring to finish my degree - I'm a full-time student and also work 15-20 hrs/week (from home right now, although that may change depending on internship opportunities).

While I lived away, my younger brother (13) - we'll call him Winston - developed a game he calls ""QWA."" The game is throwing a yoga ball around the basement. He does this for hours. He broke several things that I left outside my room, has put holes in the walls, etc. but my family generally laughs it off like it's a totally normal thing to do. And I ignored it until I moved back home.

But now I'm back. And the first issue was that it's very upsetting to my cat, who lives with me. He's developed stress-related health issues and Winston locks him in my room for hours to play this game, and often forgets to open the door when he leaves.

The second issue is that, obviously, I am working in my room in the basement. I simply cannot work while he is throwing a yoga ball against my door, and I don't think I have to defend that.

My mother gets really upset with me when I suggest that Winston shouldn't be allowed to play this ""game"" now that I'm back. The only argument that holds any weight (imo) is that this is clearly a coping mechanism for dealing with his issues with my dad. What I would add here in my own defense is that when I was 13, I was being really, really abused - had developed an eating disorder, depression and anxiety - and she explicitly told me to just take it to ""protect my brothers."" So it's difficult for me to accept her argument that he should be allowed to do whatever he wants because my dad is sometimes mean or controlling to him. It's also relevant that I have repeatedly suggested other activities like basketball (we have a hoop) or tennis (we live near courts) which (a) would resolve this conflict and (b) probably would be better coping skills bc they are normal games and could be played with others in a healthy social environment.

Clearly I have a lot of resentment towards my mom, and clearly all of this is bogged down in decades of unhealthy dynamics. I just need people who aren't in it to tell me - am I being totally unreasonable and prying away a coping mechanism from my younger brother, OR is this a reasonable complaint to have in light of all the extenuating circumstances and possible solutions?

I started sharing an apartment with a friend of mine last year. We've always been on good terms, but we set some ground rules so we could be on the same page right at the start. One of these involved always asking the other about sleepovers.

She got into a relationship about 6 months ago, and has since virtually moved into her boyfriends house [as in, she still pays rent, but rarely goes home, and he himself has stayed over a couple of nights only]. I didn't ask for the arrangement, but of course it has been comfortable having the place for myself. 

It just so happens that her boyfriends' house is having some construction done, and they moved back to our apartment while it is ongoing. Mind you, I got no warning about this other than a vague ""boyfriend will be staying a few days"" message. It has since been 2 ½ weeks, and even though he isn't a bad guy at all, I feel like a stranger in my own house because he has the same shifts as me, whereas she works a different shift, so I'm either sharing the home with him, or both of them on their days off. I was talking about it with my family, expressing how I wanted to ask her when the construction will end, as I really don't feel well splitting a house to someone I barely know. I thought they'd understand my side, but both my parents' and my brother told me I was being unfair as she hasn't been staying over. This has been eating me up inside and I honestly do not know anymore. So, WIBTA if I ask her about it?

"We recently moved from the middle of the city to the suburbs, the main reason was our 1 year old, both for space and safety.

We are now in a home and it's great, but this one car has been sitting out front for months, and was there long before we moved in. It's parked at the curb and totally full to the windows with garbage.

I don't want this garbage filled car in front of our house and I find it hard to sleep knowing he's moving around out there at night (I see him sleeping all day). I put a bat under my bed and check on every noise I hear.

Anyways, me and my best friend have known each other since preschool.  We trust each other very much, and many people have actually thought we were in a relationship and gay.
Anywho, when we were 16, we had our first girlfriends.  It was an amazing time for us, talking about them, giving tips.  Bragging about them.  
However, we eventually got sick of our GFs, but we didn’t have the balls to tell.  Sooo, we started getting affairs.  We didn’t want our girlfriends to find out though, so every time we came to meet up (privately of course) we would start with a pledge to never snitch on each other.
Now, I have long since grown out of that.  I came clean to my GF, and she forgave me and we’re still dating.  
Who didn’t grow out was my best friend.  He’s still having affairs.  The worst part is that he and his gf are married.  
I’ve met with his gf multiple times, and she seemed very nice.  Every time we talk, my best friend gives me the “Don’t snitch” eyes.  Of course I didn’t.
I told him to come clean many times, but he never did. I told him to divorce, but he said it would be a hassle for him as they had kids.
One day, his wife was hanging at our house, and she kept complaining about my best friend leaving for business trips all the time.  I tried my best to keep my mouth shut.  But then, his wife saying that my best friend (I’ll call him BF now, no it’s not boyfriend) never gave her any attention any more.  
This triggered my mouth to open, and once I did, it was long before it closed.
My BF and his wife divorced soon, and life as been hell for him.  He doesn’t have a house anymore, and lives in his old truck.
Ever since I snitched on him, he has said that we promised we wouldn’t do it. He told me that I was a traitor, and I betrayed him and ruined his life.  And he has a point.  I remember pledging to never tell, pinky promising, and etc.
I haven’t talked to him since then, and feel really guilty.  His life has practically been ruined.  AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Well today we were pretty overstaffed with very little guest and I didn't get a single table. We also have a manager who over staffs people way too much and his labor is s*** because of it (I know this because corporate yells at him for it) like last night he cut a server off (which means they stop serving tables) and had her serve HIM for the next hour after. So today I was just running food and running drinks for servers while some of them were hanging out at the podium and I thought fuck it I don't want to get 8 an hour to help other servers get tips. Plus some of them were complaining about how they don't have tables so I thought well if there's a manager that won't send me home and their servers who want more tables then I want to pull the sick card. I made sure they were fine and wouldn't get f***** over plus I wasn't even scheduled as a server, but I still have a feeling of guilt. AITA

c3yck0	2019-06-23 03:00:59	Throwaway12056311	AITA For spilling the beans on my ex-wife's depression and insecurity issues?	"Hi reddit.

&#x200B;

So I was with my now ex for about 6 years, and of that time, we were married for about 3. We have a 2 year old together. She had a difficult pregnancy, was sick a lot, and fell into a depressive state that got much much worse after the baby was born. Think full tilt PPD. She refused to seek any help despite the urging of me and a tiny handful of close friends she let in on how she was feeling. Everyone else got a fake happy face which made her even more miserable. I stood by her faithfully and helped her through the worst of it. About a year and a half after the baby was born she started feeling better, but she seemed somehow, changed? She engaged in more risky behavior than I'd ever seen her do before. Weed went from a once in a while thing to a multiple times per day routine, she'd drive under the influence, and the like. She had this hardened, standoffish edge that replaced the goofiness and carefree demeanor that I fell in love with.

&#x200B;

The whole time she was pregnant, and into the time after we went through these rough cycles where she felt super anxious about sex and didn't want to be touched, and asked me to let her dictated the pace and flow of our sex life. Naturally, I would respect that. That would turn into her getting upset because she started feeling insecure because I wasn't initiating frequently, and if I told her that I was only following through with her request as best I could, I'd be met with the suggestion that I was shifting the blame on her because either I didn't want to admit I wasn't attracted to her anymore, I was cheating on her, or I was gay (???). This took a huge toll on our sex life and that made things worse across the board.

&#x200B;

Finally she told me she wanted a divorce, that she'd been seeing another guy and that she didn't see me as a partner anymore, more of a roommate and caregiver. I was devastated. Our divorce was messy because she wanted full custody of our child and I had to fight tooth and nail to get 50/50. She told me that she felt that the custody fight was just an attack on her. I just really like being a dad and want equal time with my kid. 

&#x200B;

She's made a habit of telling people that I was terrible, abusive, etc to anyone that will listen. Yesterday she made a long facebook post dragging me through the mud and slandering me all over the place. To this point i've grinned and beared it, but I snapped and replied letting her have it and laying it out similarly to how I did here. I followed up with some screenshots of our texts to validate what I was saying. She didn't deny any of it, rather she claimed I was just being abusive again by calling her out. In the last 24 hours i've had a lot of people jump on me not so much for defending myself but for outing her mental health issues which she'd done a lot to try to conceal from general view. In my mind I was just \*finally\* defending my good name.

She is a high powered career woman and seems to think that that gets her whatever she wants, regardless of manners.

On the menu it clearly stated that a mocha frappe was a blended iced coffee drink with chocolate. A latte there was a blended iced coffee drink with no chocolate. She ordered 4 mochas, one without chocolate. The cashier asked if she meant 3 mochas and one latte. My grandma insisted it was 4 mochas, and proceeded to not-so-quietly call the employee stupid. I had my kids with me and that's not the example I strive to set at all, so I said to her, outloud, ""That was kind of rude.

Then you buy your ticket and food and whatnot. 

So here's the scenario, the place is relatively dead, I was kinda surprised actually, there were only about 8 people in front of us in line when we walked in. So we're standing in line talking about whatever, waiting to buy tickets. There's maybe 4 people behind the counter, one is operating a register while the others are doing idk, *concession related things*. Finally it's our turn and a lady calls us over. Mike buys his ticket and starts ordering his popcorn and stuff. It's at this point I hear a voice over to my right, ""*I can help whoever is next*"". Another lady is opening a register, so without thinking about it I walk over there. She looks at me like I just kicked a hamster and I buy my ticket (without incident) then head twords the screening-room.

c3ybvu	2019-06-23 02:59:10		AITA: Left a groupchat	"In college my friends (some of whom were my roommates) created a very active a group chat. There were 7 of us, 5 guys and 2 women, and everybody in the friend group only communicated in the chat. Long story short, it was important and heavily used chat for us. We all just graduated college and scattered throughout the US for work, with me being the furthest (1,600 miles away). 

In the last 6 months or so a casual friend (“Jess”) of the close friend group started hanging around. Jess was mostly the friend of one friend (“Morgan”), but we happily included her. Jess had some pretty clear issues with depression, anxiety, and self-esteem that came out when she got drunk, and she put a lot of that on us (like coming over unannounced, drinking our alcohol, then drunkenly crying about her boy problems and staying with us for the weekend). 

she was using our friend group as an emotional crutch, which, whatever, that’s fine and we accommodated. One day a few months into this she drunkenly confronted Morgan about why she wasn’t in the group chat. Morgan didn’t want to explain it was a very old chat that we put all of our business in, so she just added her to the chat. We were all kind of uncomfortable, but we all let it slide and tried to integrate her into the conversations. 

Jess will pop in for a day then be no contact for a couple weeks or so. The problem is that she seems to have recently decided she hates me. For example she will respond to an econ debate (2 of us r Econ PhD students) by saying things like “heythrowinthisaway, you sound fuckin stupid lol.” We often goof on each other but this doesn’t really fit the style, so i just assumed she was trying to rib me. I’ve always completely ignored these comments. 

Today, after i talked about my summer job she posted “Dude seriously learn to shut the fuck up. We don’t care about every detail in your life.” I texted Morgan and 1 other member privately about possibly kicking Jess out of the chat (i know iata for this) and they both expressed concern over Jess’s depression and anxiety and how she was probably just trying to fit in. I accepted that and calmed down, until later in the day Jess popped back into the chat to post “heythrowinthisaway i wasn’t joking seriously stfu.” I had had enough and just left the group because i didn’t want to deal with her any more but didn’t want to forcefully exclude her. 

I live very far away and work 60 hour weeks, and am starting to form a new friend group here, my life is branching away from them. I justified leaving by thinking i have all of their phone numbers and will still be in regular contact. However, I got 4 messages telling me that leaving the chat (and my strongest connection to my friends) was an asshole move, and i was “treating my friends like disposable trash.” I honestly think they’re overreacting to me leaving because i still want to stay in contact, but AITA?

TLDR: Hostile person joined chat who dislikes me, and i left the group."		1	0

So they don’t know what it was like to be a kid and it reflected in their parenting styles. My father was laid back and didn’t pay attention to us and my mother was a strict disciplinarian with small mistakes ending up in severe punishments. Despite my father being a reverend, my mother was the one enforcing these strict religious principles. With them belonging to the church of Pentecost many normal everyday thing were banned such as...
• Non gospel music 
• No shorts
• No friends over 
• No privacy (closed doors and phone passcodes)

My family and I traveled to Rome over the summer, where it was like 100 degrees out. Naturally, I decided to wear a tank top and some short jean shorts. We decided to visit a church that contained the body of the saint my high school was named after which I thought was kinda dope. So as we were walking around inside, a priest approached me and told me in Spanish “we’re not at a beach we’re at a church.” At first I was taken aback and I walked away to tell my family. The only plausible option to “fix” my outfit was to put on my grandpa’s collared shirt because he had an undershirt on. So I threw it on and continued my tour of the church. The priest approached me for the second time and repeated the same demeaning statement in English. I cordially responded “I please just want to see the body of the saint and then I promise I will leave!” He replied with a firm NO and for some reason, that fucking set me off. I then exploded into a fit of verbal rage and screamed “You’re such a dick FUCK YOU!” in a somewhat crowded church. I then was dragged by the hair by my brother and father while still berating the priest. Lastly, I yelled “and fuck you too” to the two doormen who sneered at me when I entered the church because of my outfit. So basically, AITA?

Anyways, I’m 16 (female) and I really have no desire to get piercings or tattoos. I used to have my ears pierced but the lady who did them when I was baby was probably as old as I was for how crooked they are and how much it hurt to even have earrings in. When I was about 13, I finally took them out and let the holes close up. Now, my mom is the type of woman to force you to do a lot of shit. She forced me to get rid a lot of my clothes cause they don’t suit her taste, she forced me to stop listening to certain artists cause she didn’t like them. (It wasn’t like artists who were overly sexual, it was artists like Ariana grande, etc). And forced me to have this horrible short hair cut that was so ugly and I hated it. She now lets me pick out my hairstyles after I finally yelled at her over the horrible hairstyle.

So whenever we go to go get our haircuts, there is this very nice lady. She cuts and dyes hair as well as piercings. So whenever we go get our haircuts,
My mother always tells her “can you please pierce her ears?” When she doesn’t even ask me. I do not want any piercings. I don’t have anything cause piercings, I just want don’t any. Thankfully the lady said she couldn’t do it that day due to a busy schedule. When we got in the car, i bitched her out and said she is being really rude about this and then she pulled the whole “I’m your mother, do as I say”.
Fast forward a couple months, my mother tells me she messaged the girl who cuts our hair about me. Saying I was acting like a chicken shit, being disrespectful and many more things. I really wanted to cry cause it honestly hurt. I really like this hair lady and I felt humiliated.

I went and ranted to a couple friends of mine and they instantly jumped on me. Saying I was being a big crybaby and to just get my ears pierced. They also said my mother just wants to have a girly girl, so let her pierce my ears. And many other people told me as well that I was being over dramatic and that it’s just some piercings.

I went upstairs to my room, and couldn’t open my door.  It was locked.

A few weeks later. I learned from my friend (he hangs out with her) that she was having that affair for MONTHS.  Another thing he told me was that she was the one who stole $50 from me.  (I was going to use the $50 for a birthday gift.).   He then told me that if I looked in the basement of my house, and went to the box to the left, I would find a sex tape.  
Guess what I found?  I also found (by myself when I was moving out) that she had a planner.  One of the notes that was on it was a plan to take my credit card, and run away with the guy.  So yeah, she was pretty unloyal.
Cut to now, I’m in a horrible state, and had debts to pay.  I was pretty much broke.  So, I had to go for my last resort.
I texted my ex-gf and told her that she would have to pay me $400 dollars or I would tell her family everything my friend told me.  She freaked out, and started begging for me to not do it.
For some background info, her family is very religious, and cheating was a sin in their religion.
 Anyways, I felt bad, but it was the only way.  After a few more threats, she caved in and gave me the money.  
I honestly feel awful, and my mind keeps telling me to give the money back.  AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c3y6bl	2019-06-23 02:42:28		AITA for snapping at my dad for showing up at my new house to “check in” on my son (2 y/o) without asking me first?	"My wife and I had our son kind of young. She was 19 and I was 20 when he was born. He’s now two. For a while, we lived at my parents’ house because we couldn’t afford a place. It ended up so that my son got really close with his grandparents since they watched him all the time while my wife and I worked. (They’re retired and have money and pretty much spoiled him, but it was kind of to be expected). 

But we finally saved up enough to move. Didn’t go that well. Son had a meltdown the first day in our new house (earlier tonight). It’s a house he’s not used to and he didn’t want to go to bed or settle down. That kind of hurt my wife’s feelings, I could tell. She’s told me before that she sometimes feels like she and I are the “second” set of parents. I think she felt that way tonight too. 

My my dad happened to call during my son’s meltdown just to “check in”. Obviously he heard him crying and then decided (without actually asking) to come over. 

I kind of figured he was going to do that but I was kind of annoyed too. 

Anyway my dad came over and said he just wanted to read my son a story because he thought it would calm him like it did when we were at their house. I got aggravated  and said he just came to make us look like bad parents and make himself look good. He got offended and said he was leaving and that I didn’t have to worry about him ever coming over by again. 

Son was still having his tantrum all while this was going on (he had been like that for an hour at that point in and off). My wife then went Benedict Arnold on me and told my dad to just take our son Home with him. And he did. 

Obviously I don’t think that was the right way to handle it and I said that after they left. She then tells me I didn’t have to be so mean to my dad since he’s helping us. I tried to explain where I was coming from again but she ended up saying she was tired and went to sleep. 

I’m still up and figured I would vent and  hopefully get some feedback on whether I was wrong. Thanks for reading."	Asshole	1	0

c3y481	2019-06-23 02:36:35	14725ta	AITA for wanting to be able to take my grandma out without my aunt.	"Today my grandmother told me, she will not go out to lunch/dinner with me without my aunt.

My grandma and I have been close my entire life, she's raised me like a daughter. I became my grandparents caregiver after my grandparents both had surgeries.

She used to say, ' I was the most important person in the world to her.' Recently, my grandfather passed away and I've had medical problems so it's been difficult to see her. My aunt moved in after my grandfather passed (not going to go into all of that BS.) My aunt attacks me every time I visit. My sister and friend both made a comment on how rude she was to my friend when she came over to visit. My sister, also makes comments on how rude she is when she's discussing my medical conditions. (my uncle will be asking my sister questions about the tests that were performed and she'll starting taking about food or some stupid stuff.)  I lived in that house, but also had my own apartment near work.

When my mom talks  all she says is how everything my mom says is a lie. She tries to take over my mom's friends and one friend even said point blank she only wants to go out with my mom and grandmother. (it's stuff like you can't have grapefruit with blood pressure medicine)

My grandmother and I used to do a lot together, she knows most of my friends and most of her friends have my phone number. I knew everything about my grandmother. The joke was that, she was going to move in with me and my grandfather was going to move in with my sister and mom. My grandmother told me that she will not go out without my aunt. I can't even take my grandmother to the store without my aunt present.

Another thing to note is my grandmother will only call me when my aunt isn't home or is asleep. I am perfectly capable of taking care of my grandmother, I have been doing it for years. My aunt has to have maids clean the house, order take out, and have people bath my grandmother. The only thing she really does for her is drives her to appointments.

AITA for being upset that my grandmother won't let me take her out alone.

When we got near the stadium he parked on the road and I said “this doesnt look good, you might get towed here”. But he persisted and after the game we came back and sure enough he got towed. After the game I had plans to go get dinner with a bunch of friends. But seeing that he got towed I had no way down there. He called his mom and she was coming to pick us up and take us home. But instead I got myself an uber and left my friend to go get dinner. Thinking about it now I kind of feel like an ass. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c3y23q	2019-06-23 02:30:27	carmy856	AITA for getting upset with my husband over money?	"This has always been a point of contention between us. It’s finally come to a head. 

I don’t work. I stay home with our children. All the household income comes from him. Any major monetary decisions are always his. I have input of course, but not very much of it matters. 

Ok to our problem. My sister is coming to visit us from the mainland. We’re in Hawaii. I asked her if my mom was coming too and if it was a surprise to let me know to accommodate the pickup at the airport and so on. She said no because she couldn’t afford it. My sister got a bonus at work and was able to buy two tickets, Hers and my nephews. 

I have never, not once, asked for money for my family. Ever. He always gives his mom $2-400 every time we stay there for a long period of time. I never say anything. One, it’s his mom and two, he’s the money maker. Anyways, I asked if it was ok if we got a ticket for my mom. He didn’t even think about it. Said no. Ok fine, no problem.  A couple of weeks ago I got into a fender bender. I have a minivan and well it was perfect for my family of 5 and them 2. Well it’s going to the shop the week she gets here. The other car we have is a Toyota Camry. No way is it big enough for 7 people. Anyways, I asked if it was ok to rent a car for the two weeks she’s here. I want to take her to explore the island and We don’t have transportation. He said no. That she could pay for it if she wants to. Like it’s already a big sacrifice for her to come visit. I’m not going to make her spend on a rental. We have the means.  She doesn’t. 

It broke my heart. So I confronted him about what his problem was. I told him that I never ask for anything for my family. He’s so nonchalant like nothing is the matter. I’ve been on island for a year and it was tough. I’m on antidepressants because it was such a hit to my psyche. Took me almost 8 months to adjust. I’m very close to my family so it was really rough not being able to drive to visit them. I yelled how selfish he was and how I don’t understand why he can accommodate his family but won’t do mine. 

So, AITA? 

Edited to add: I also told him I’m done. This might be my hill to die on. Not over money. I just don’t know. Like I hate having no say in anything financially. I don’t spend like crazy. Last thing I bought myself was two $8 shirts, and before that? I don’t remember because it doesn’t happen often. 

My daughter is 10 and I’m already drilling in her head that she can’t rely on any man financially."	Not the A-hole	0	0

She said I’m an “asshole” because I’ve hit on all the girls we hang out with and I didn’t view her as an individual.	"Happy Saturday night Reddit, well hopefully for some of you, not for me. 

I’m so lucky to have an awesome group of friends I met my first year of college. I wasn’t super cool in HS and after moving away I finally feel like I’ve arrived if that makes sense. I’ve had so much fun I decide to stay for summer school and from the twelve-ish people who were in our clique during school, five of us are left. 

On Friday my friend Madison called me and said she was super bored and since I was the only one left who didn’t leave for 4th or July intersession break we should hang out. I was so up for it but something in her tone made me think this was way more than friends. So we went out and drank and danced with each other and had just and amazing time. I know this will sound embarrassing but it’s the first time since middle school when I had my first kiss that I’ve been one on one with a girl in any capicity. We were so drunk she said we should lyft for her apartment. I was wow this is like maybe going to happen. At the ride share stand I sort of put my arm around her and she leaned into me and said she was freezing. We sat like that for maybe a minute and then I tried to kiss her. 

Edit this is when I said “I’d love to date you.” I left a key piece out of the OP. Sorry. 

She lost her shit on me she said I misread her signals. I told her I was so sorry. The Lyft was totally silent and when we got to her apartment she said “sleep on the fucking papa San and don’t come anywhere near me.” I felt so bad.

In the morning she woke me up she said she was really sorry she freaked out on me. I said I was sorry for reading the situation wrong. She said basically “you’re a really great guy, you’re attractive but you come across as so desperate and you’ve hit on every girl we hang out with so all the good stuff is ruined and it makes you an asshole.” She invited me to breakfast but I felt so bad I declined and came home. 

I’ve felt so bad all day long and don’t ever want to be a creep or in-cel type of guy. I’d love some honest (and maybe gentle) feedback on whether or not I was the asshole last night?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c3y0x8	2019-06-23 02:27:05	DumbTiredAndGay	AITA for taking my best friend's ex's side?	"Back here, got another story but a bit shorter and not about my own love life. Instead it's about my friends. Sorry about formatting, i'm on mobile.

My best friend: F
F's ex boyfriend: Ex
Me: Me

So F and Ex are both really good friends of mine. They recently broke up (F breaking up with Ex, as she found him ""annoying and clingy""). Yesterday Ex messaged me. He said he had something to tell me and he came out to me as gay. He said he's always kind of known but repressed it, but over the last few months he couldn't keep it repressed anymore. He and E got together about a month ago, whereas this had been on his mind for months prior. We talked and i offered him all of the support i could give, including being there when he's planning on coming out to our peers. He's so much more happy and confident in himself since he came out.

Now F didnt take this lightly. Ex hadn't messaged her as she refused to talk to him since the breakup. However he did also tell a mutual friend who in turn outed him to her. When i saw F at work, she said she had ""tea"" to tell me and i said i likely already knew what she was gonna say. She got annoyed and stopped talking when i said ""About Ex, isnt it?"". Ex had later messaged her ""Hey i have something to tell you, i'm gay"". I don't know if she replied

F began to rant to me about how it's ""sudden"" and that she doesn't believe it. She feels like it's for attention and that he ""cant be gay"". I can understand where her feelings are coming from, but i don't think she understands where his are coming from. I tried talking to her but i have a short temper and the, lowkey homophobic attitude she had almost set me off. I ended up getting annoyed and just ending the conversation.

so, AITA for taking his side instead of hers/staying neutral? I guess i'm taking his side aswell because i know how difficult it is to come out. I can understand why he tried to hide and repress it."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"My wife just finished reading the Harry Potter books for the first time (for years she wouldn’t read them “cause they’re dumb” but I stayed with her anyways). Growing up I loved the HP series, and would read the whole set 2-3 times a summer, and still give it a read through every year or two.

But I absolutely hate the movies. Always have. Always been very vocal about so all our friends know. I think they ruin everything good about the books. Not here to justify that though :)

We hit it off good and we hung out a couple times and it was looking good. We FaceTimed and called each other everyday for hours. Eventually after a few weeks I caught feelings and I told her.

Even though this sounds like everyone’s dream I wanted to keep hanging out just the sex lol. She told me that if’s not a good idea to hangout anymore since she knows I have feelings and dosent want to hurt me, then tells me we shouldn’t have sex either. I just kinda shrugged it off I’m like maybe a couple days and we will be back to hanging out again. She says she dosent want to hurt me however when ever I ask what she’s doing she tells me that a dude is supposed to be coming over . I get jealous over girls I like, especially when it seemed like she was telling me this stuff to make me jealous.  We haven’t been the same and I’m debating on ending it with this person . She called me immature and a douchebag for getting pissed , but I feel like a lot of people would get jealous in this situation. Am I in the wrong ?		1	0

c3xscy	2019-06-23 02:01:55		AITA for purposefully starting arguments with my wife	So I have an extremely hard time trying to talk about issues with my wife. I am absolutely secure in laying my issues on the table and trying to work through them with another person, but with my wife it becomes a whole other story. Any time I try to talk to her about something that is bothering me or causing me any kind of grief it always becomes an argument. She has zero interest in seeing an alternate view of a situation and always becomes hostile when I attempt to approach her with my own perspective. Due to this dilemma I am forced to enter in to this argumentative domain anytime I want to speak my mind. It has become so bad, in fact, that before I even try to approach her with any type of opposition I have to try and map out a battle plan of how my argument will go. I DO NOT want to ever argue with her, so most thoughts go unspoken. But, when there is a legitimate issue at hand I have to power through and try to argue my way into some type of peaceful litigation to try and reach some form of comprisal outcome. So my question is, am I the asshole for, knowingly starting a fight to get my point across?		1	0

c3xrrs	2019-06-23 02:00:19		AITA for being upset that my brother is borrowing my car?	"So my parents bought me a car last year out of the goodness of their hearts without me ever even asking for one. They've constantly referred to it as my car and have never once tried to use the ""it's still in our name"" card once on me because they already promised that it would be in my name by the end of this year.
With that being said, I've kept my mouth shut on multiple occasions when my mother would call me telling me that she would be driving my car on a four hour trip both ways whenever she would take it to Richmond, Va. because I figured it wouldn't due for my car to sit and not get driven until I could get it down to South Carolina. Besides, she's my mother and she did buy the car for me, so I didn't really mind all that much anyways.

What does piss me off however is that she called me HALFWAY to meeting my brother and tells me that he's borrowing my car because his has broken down. What?
I'm pissed because first off, she was literally just talking about getting it over into my name and then she decides to let him use my car without even consulting me on the matter of whether or not I'd be comfortable with him using it. Second, my parents own FOUR other cars aside from mine, two of which my brother could have been given to use, but she decided to take the car that was supposed to have my name on it in a matter of months and gives it to him to use, again, without asking my opinion. Three, she just told me that he told her he got a ticket LAST WEEK for going 80 in a 60, that she had to tell him to stop speeding multiple times, AND that he tailgates other extremely badly and has absolutely no respect for my car and no regard for anything she was telling him and that he did whatever he wanted while he was driving it. And then she told me not to get spun up about it after telling me that.

I've not said a word about how I'm feeling about all of this to my parents because I respect them and I don't want to feel like an asshole.

So last school year me and my 'bff' (lets call her ""Red"" were having a rough year but within the last few months she just kinda drifted away from me so we don't talk anymore and frankly I don't want to associate myself with her at all but something happened today to make me post here...

Today I went to visit a friend who I haven't seen since October. I knew my friend was inviting Red and 3 other people so I get there, we eat lunch, everything is fine, but then it came time for Red to leave... She stood up and walked over to my friend and hugged her saying good bye she looked at me and said ""come give me a hug"" and I said ""Nah"" she looked at me and asked again. I said no again. I felt so mean, I regret it but it felt good at the same time as a final goodbye to her.

I know its either I'm the asshole or nobody is but I had some good reasons to do it some I cannot say because of confidentiality but I feel like I did the right thing. If I decided to hug her I think I would be doing more harm to myself than telling her a flat out no.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c3xraf	2019-06-23 01:59:00	Strict_Mastodon	Update: AITA for refusing to wear a wig to my friend’s wedding?	"The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c0xp8l/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_wig_to_my_friends/?st=JX7KR9P2&sh=bd95d6aa

So first of all, thank you so much for your replies and advice! I’m writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because I want people to see my friend isn’t actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.

I texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don’t live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). It turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. Her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. Like I said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. She’s also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. That’s why she told me she couldn’t pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. Neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when I told her over the phone. That’s also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren’t covered. It turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn’t want to tell us that because she’s already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law’s money. (Apparently it’s her fiancé’s family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) 

That’s why her reasons didn’t ring true to me as well. She didn’t want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. She assured me she thinks I look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought I look bad. 

I know people will question how I can believe her, but I’ve been friends with her for nearly ten years and I give her the benefit of the doubt. We’ve been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. 

I’m still side eyeing the plantation wedding but I didn’t tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fiancé’s family I didn’t want to pile on. I do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. I went to the plantation’s website and they do acknowledge slavery’s evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. 

I did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and I explained why. She was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. She wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn’t even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. She’s kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times I’ve had to point out something she said could be hurtful she’s always been understanding instead of defensive. 

I decided I’m going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. It’ll still be pretty short, so that’s okay. She’s fine with that too except she was worried I’ll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fiancé’s family. I reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair I’ve pretty much heard it all. By the time we hung up I felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship."

c3xr44	2019-06-23 01:58:24		AITA for being mad at my bf for not letting me train the dog?	"By the time I was 10 years old, I read every book and watched every film about dogs the library had.This was something I was very passionate about and was very important to [me.My](https://me.My) parents got me a puppy and said it would be mine and I could train [it.My](https://it.My) mom thought she would do me a favour and train it for me.I still feel bitter about my mom taking away my opportunity like that.A couple years ago,I took a university course of the psychology of learning with dog training being a primary example used.I loved this course, and helped me feel more confident in my ability to train a dog. 

My bf and I have been dating for 3 years and I have told him about this,numerous times actually. But he did not agree and he was quick to respond about the importance of obedience classes, being discouraging and quite mean at times about it.I understand his thoughts,he did have valid points,but I dont feel like he truly listened to [me.Im](https://me.Im) a passive, non-confrontational person and so I didnt try hard to convey how important this was to me, I thought I would get my chance at some [point.Now](https://point.Now) whenever I try bringing up the past conversations, he says he doesnt remember saying the things I know he has and does not believe he would say anything mean to me.

A year ago, my bf and I moved in together.About 4 months ago, we went out and adopted another dog.This dog is almost the exact definition of my dream dog and I was ecstatic to be going home with [him.My](https://him.My) bf did like another dog more but agreed to adopt this one because of how much I wanted it.Because he got my dream dog, I let myself believe he would be open to considering me for training.But he was not.Everything I said and did he was quick to correct me.I felt I could not do anything right.Things became tense between us and so we had a serious talk.I told him how hurt I was and he told me he was insecure because he doesnt know how to train and was not confident, needed my support.He signed up for obedience classes but due to delays, couldnt get started immediately and so continued training on his own at home.I jokingly said the dog would be perfectly trained by the time he started the class, he immediately responded that he would always do obedience no matter what.A few days later he said he was thinking of dropping out because the dog is almost trained and to make me happy.I told him it wouldnt make me happy, its too late for me to achieve my goal since the training is almost done. 

I am feeling beyond hurt, unheard, left out, defeated.I feel like he took and destroyed my dream, and I feel bitter and resentful for it.But Im starting to wonder if these feelings are valid.The dog was intended to be his so I worry I am acting entitle, selfish, and immature, like a child throwing a temper tantrum for not getting my own way.I worry I am being manipulative by being so expressive with my feelings, making him feel bad when he shouldnt.

&#x200B;

During the hike, I decided to not engage in conversations much. I only knew one of the coworkers' kids from chem, and we have nothing in common, so I made some small talk only. And although my dad is close friends with his coworkers, I barely know them and didn't really know how to make a conversation with them.

What made things worse- we live in a really, really hot state, and I was about to melt under the 100 degree weather (there was no shade for a good half of the path). This made me kinda bad-tempered, so I just stayed quiet because it was too tiring and hot to run up a steep rocky path and talk at the same time.

&#x200B;

I think this makes me the asshole- at the end, I slipped out of sight without saying any proper goodbyes in an attempt to get the hell out of the sun, because my dad always has this 30-minute ending conversation with everyone (no kidding, it was literally 30 minutes), and I was just so done with the heat.

&#x200B;

In the car, my father said I didn't talk nearly as much as he wanted me to and said he was disappointed that I didn't even say proper goodbyes to everyone. I know this isn't such a pressing issue, but my dad's still really mad that I made a bad impression on his coworkers, and I think I fucked up."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3xp4l	2019-06-23 01:52:36		AITA for potentially leading this guy in a online video game to believe that im a girl just because he assumed so and I never questioned it or corrected him? Apologies in advance if you guys find this post stupid and juvenile, feel free to roast me on that if you wish.	"Okay, so basically my life is in shambles in a lot of ways and I have next to no friends IRL or online. I play a lot of Overwatch and have always wanted someone to play with regularly but it's always been hard to find someone who actually seems to like my company until I met this person. 

If any of you play Overwatch, I'm basically a Mercy one trick which for some dumb reason comes with a common stereotype that you're a girl and so people often assume that of me because I never use voice chat. 

So this guy comes in and adds me as a friend and we really have a lot of fun playing together even though things started to get a little weird. I can definitely tell he thinks a I'm a girl and has referred to me as his girlfriend at points.

He definitely plays with me enough that makes it seem like he wants to be more than friends. Even saying that he hates Overwatch and only plays it because of me. And...saying that he wants to pay for the books I need to study for school because I can't afford them. I declined of course but he seemed serious. 

So...I'm not a girl but I do really like his company and I honestly like being referred to as a girl for some reason. I'm really fucked up in the head I know but it makes me feel really nice when he acts like his girlfriend. I've never felt this special to someone before in my life and I always hated being a dude anyways.

So...AITA for not telling him that I'm a biologically a male as long as it's just a silly video game ""relationship""? If he really asked I would tell him and I feel like he would unfriend me immediately but for now I dont see why I should."		1	0

They've constantly referred to it as my car and have never once tried to use the ""it's still in our name"" card once on me because they already promised that it would be in my name by the end of this year.
With that being said, I've kept my mouth shut on multiple occasions when my mother would call me telling me that she would be driving my car on a four hour trip both ways whenever she would take it to Richmond, Va. because I figured it wouldn't due for my car to sit and not get driven until I could get it down to South Carolina. Besides, she's my mother and she did buy the car for me, so I didn't really mind all that much anyways.
What does piss me off however is that she called me HALFWAY to meeting my brother and tells me that he's borrowing my car because his has broken down. What?
I'm pissed because first off, she was literally just talking about getting it over into my name and then she decides to let him use my car without even consulting me on the matter of whether or not I'd be comfortable with him using it. Second, my parents own FOUR other cars aside from mine, two of which my brother could have been given to use, but she decided to take the car that was supposed to have my name on it in a matter of months and gives it to him to use, again, without asking my opinion. Three, she just told me that he told her he got a ticket LAST WEEK for going 80 in a 60, that she had to tell him to stop speeding multiple times, AND that he tailgates other extremely badly and has absolutely no respect for my car and no regard for anything she was telling him and that he did whatever he wanted while he was driving it. And then she told me not to get spun up over, in her words, ""your brother using your car"".
However, I feel like I AM the asshole in this situation because it doesn't have my name on it and the fact that he needs to use the car, but I'm extremely upset that the car that's supposed to be mine will more than likely come back in worse shape than when he got it, with way more mile than he needs to put on it because he'll run it into the ground going here there and everywhere because he'll have the ""it's not my car"" mentality, and the fact that I need that car because I'm due with my first child in October and I need a good car to get her to and from doctors appointments.
I guess what I'm asking is am I in the wrong for feeling the way I do about the situation because I do feel like I'm wrong in feeling the way I do about all of this."		1	0
c3xmvw	2019-06-23 01:45:44	FlatbushZubumafu	AITA for leaving my cousins wedding after 30 mins?	"Context: I already have really bad social anxiety and my family is part of the LDS Church which tends to look down on my life choices. I am not allowed to attend the actual ceremony due to my percieved sins. 

I got there on time and went through the typical LDS wedding cultural traditions. Greeting the bride and groom, congratulating, sitting down for cake and saying hi to the family.

5 mins after finishing up with cake, I decide to take off. On my way out, I'm stopped by a cousin about 5 years my senior. I didn't get to talk much to her as we were always too far apart in age to really get familiar.

She asks me how I'm doing and where me and my fiance are living. After about 5 minutes of forced conversation, I eventually am able to make my exit.

I left feeling uncomfortable. I'm used to feeling like the black sheep of the family. My parents/her parents/our entire extended family are LDS and don't approve of our relationship right now. They occasionally will tell me ""they love me but hate the sins I am making"" in nicer words.

Looking back, I think they may have been offended I didn't stay longer and interacted longer. And I get it, we don't see each other often but I never feel comfortable around them. They're not mean or rude to me, and are really quite welcoming. I was even invited to Sunday dinner. But the constant pressure of being considered a sinner has really gotten to me."

Long story short, I do some print layout and graphic design, and they asked me if I would design the programs.

&#x200B;

Just for background, these are NOT nice people.  The whole time we've been married (3 years next month) they have intruded on how we do things, demanded grandchildren, nagged my wife to know how our money is handled, given me the cold shoulder, etc etc etc.  I have been nothing but polite in return, but if I don't like them, there is very good reason.

&#x200B;

So I did the programs, but I also did put in a few extras.  Specifically, the decorative borders contain a few very well-disguised penises, and the second letters of the words in one paragraph spell out a rude message.

&#x200B;

I need to emphasize that these things will NEVER BE FOUND!!!  I hid everything far too well for anything to be seen unless you know what to look for, and I got a lot of compliments on the program.

&#x200B;

That was last November.  Yesterday my wife was making a scrapbook and wanted to include that program.  I thought enough time had passed and made the mistake of telling her about what I slipped in.  She did not take it well, in fact she's furious.  She says I've ruined the ""spirit"" of their celebration.  My thinking is, how I could have ruined it if nobody knows????  But she insists that I've ruined it for her, and now she's going to tell them herself because she's sure that they'll find out eventually and they need to hear it from her before they hear it from someone else.

&#x200B;

I don't need to say how terrible this would be for us.  They've already threatened to cut us off before and I'm terrified this would make them actually do it.  My wife refuses to listen to me, and in fact she's been acting unbelievably cold to me ever since I told her, and I just don't understand why she can't either see the joke or accept my apology.

He is not always like this. Sometimes he is mean, sometimes he is considerate. He shifts back and forth throughout the day. 

He and my dad just went out for milkshakes. My dad asked if I wanted to come, I said no, I have to learn stuff for work tomorrow. As they’re walking out my brother says: “If I was the one who said no, you would say ‘you are going to regret this when mom and dad leave this Earth.’” He said the quote that was supposed to be said by me in a sarcastic voice, implying I sound pretentious. I replied: “No, that’s what I say when you say insanely mean shit to them.” He said “Damn calm down. And I’M the one who escalates shit?” 

I feel like I misjudged his intentions when he made his first comment. Looking back, I feel like he was in a peaceful mood and I was the one who snapped first. I have been feeling guilty because I feel like he was just joking and I took it into the real world.

My mom passed away a little over a year ago, and it wrecked our worlds. I took this past spring semester off school and moved back home for a mental health break. My mom was my best friend in the whole world, and it really cut me down. She and my dad were married for just over 30 years, and even though they had a love/hate relationship, I've never seen my dad mourn someone so hard.

So, my dad doesn't have a ton of friends that he hangs out with often. But, every now and then, he finds some excuse to get out of the house. Today, for example, he went on a Jeep run with some friends. I was out of town from Wednesday-today, and he told me that he would be home around 7 or 8. I got home around 4, and texted him to tell him I missed him and that I really wanted to hang out with him. 

Flash forward to now, quarter after 8. I just called my dad to see what his ETA was. He tells me he's with his sister and her husband at a bar and that they still have to go eat dinner and travel 20 minutes in the opposite direction to get his truck before he can come home. I told him I'll probably be asleep by the time he gets home (mostly because now I'm mad at him).

He does this every time, and it always annoys me. I don't have many friends, and I love hanging out with my dad because he's all that I have now. Yes, he drives me insane; yes, we NEVER see eye to eye, but after I lost my mom I realized that I have to appreciate and love my dad for as long as I have him.

I feel so split. On the one hand, I'm really glad he's having fun and out of the house. On the other hand, I can't help but be upset. I feel so stupid for trying to police him having fun, and I honestly feel like the asshole here."	Asshole	0	0

So I moved to another country recently, to be more specific, another continent. And it's very easy for local people to tell that I'm from a different race.

The thing is, I would pick up the orange and check if it's bruised, if it is I would put it back and take another one. It is totally okay to do this where I am from, and I've seen quite a lot local people do it in the new country I moved to. So I guess it's fine to touch the oranges. I don't touch the apples though.

I said pardon and the lady basically said what I did is wrong and dirty. I explained that other local people do this too so I thought it's okay to touch them. Then she said ""If you touch them other people will get infected"" and then left.

My freshman year of college (I’m now in grad school), I met a senior from a neighboring school (let’s call him Will) on a dating app that I thought was very attractive. We went on a couple dates, but I actually ended up dating a guy in my grade from my university for about 2 years. 

Will was respectful of that, but still kept in touch. He was originally from a suburb of Detroit, but now lives in Nashville. Coincidentally, I interned in Detroit last summer. He randomly came home, and went to a baseball game because my home state team was playing. I thought this was a coincidence, but he later told me he bought last minute tickets to the game after seeing the stadium on my Instagram. 

I am now going to grad school in Nashville, which is where Will lives now. I stayed with him when I came for my interview, and we’ve still stayed in touch. He keeps asking me to send naked pictures, and saying I used to be more playful when I was younger. It bothers me because I just have matured and no longer want to send those photos. I’ve explained this to him, but he says he “wishes we could go back to before”

My brother is going to a military academy tomorrow, and we had a party this afternoon to say goodbye to him. Will keeps texting me despite my letting him know I was busy spending time with my brother since we will have no communication for 6 weeks. Every time I don’t reply “quickly enough” he will text me “please don’t go now”. 

It’s a bit frustrating and to be quite honest, annoying. I feel like an asshole if I block him... especially because I’m moving to the same city as him and may see him. But at the same time, it doesn’t seem like I’m getting through to him. 

So, WIBTA if I block him on social media and his phone number? Or should I give him a chance once I move?

"My neighbors' kids like to play together in front of my house/my driveway; there are about 10 of them around 5 or 6 years old. This is completely fine except my car is parked in that driveway and they like to play games around my car. They usually end up touching or banging on the sides which is really annoying and can mess up the paint. I also have a hose in front of my house that the kids use to fill up their water guns and whatever. The problem is that I'm the one who has to actually pay for the water. I've told the kids many times to play somewhere else or at least stop touching the car and using the water if they want to play in my driveway.

The kids never listen so today I spoke with the mom of one of them. She didn't really care and said that they were just ""kids being kids."" I tried to explain that getting a new paint job and paying for water I'm not even using is really expensive. She then replied that the sidewalk is ""public property"" so I can't tell them not to stay there and since there isn't actually a fence or anything separating my driveway from the sidewalk, I can't stop the children from playing their either. After about 5 minutes of back and forth, I got pissed and told her that if I saw the kids touching my car again or playing with the water, I was gonna call the cops, and then I left.

Honestly, I don't even think the cops deal with issues like these but in the moment I didn't know how else to get her to take me seriously; maybe I am the asshole for threatening her/the kids. And what more can I say to them if they don't stop after this conversation?

When she called me to clarify why she wasn’t coming, she said she was thinking of getting married during that time. She explained why she loved the guy and why she wanted to get married so quickly (she’s religious and can’t wait longer than that to have sex). I told her I would support her normally and that she’s an adult, but that 2 months was really quick. I told her I already had a vacation planned with my family and would prefer to do that.

Some other key pieces of info are that she told me about her plans on my dad’s birthday and that she has been a pretty absent grandparent (never talks to my kids and doesn’t remember their birthdays and never asks how they are doing).

c3xa6f	2019-06-23 01:08:53		AITA for kissing him?	"Backstory ESSENTIAL for this:
-I am a 14yo (very very very close to 15yo) female 
-“John” is my mom’s friend’s son. He is 13. We have not met before.
-I dated a guy for 3 months about a year ago. It was emotionally very serious at least on my part, but we never kissed. Which always upset me.
-I have lately been dreaming about kissing people/having my first kiss/general romance. Probably bc of hormones.

Basically, I’m at his house because his mom is throwing a small pool party and invited my family, as well as another. We’re the two oldest, the little kids are annoying, so we go upstairs and lock the door to get away from them. I thought he was kind of cute, but that’s about it. He started hitting on me and I was really really flattered and we ended up kissing/making out (I’m not really sure the difference) after he asked. I thought I kind of liked him so I went along with it. He never touched me anywhere serious, although he did put his hand pretty high up my leg. After kissing twice for about a minute total he suggested we ‘do it’ in his closet. I said no. He was a bad kisser (I’m sure I wasn’t good either), there wasn’t chemistry, and after the kiss, I wasn’t even sure I liked him. I was disgusted he even suggested that, but I wasn’t really thinking too much. He asked what was to become of us and I realized I didn’t want anything at all. I told him no strings attached. He agreed, asked me to kiss him one more time, and I did. 

We then rejoined the party. I felt so so so mortified. How did I let my hormones get the best of me? I didn’t even like him like that much! Even at all really! I quickly became very cold and aloof towards him and everyone else. He continued to try and talk to me during a party game and I just kind of politely answered back, trying to end any conversation. I felt like such a jerk. I didn’t say anything rude I just feel like I lead him on and I feel terrible.

I texted my mom discretely and she took me to the bathroom and I started crying. I felt so disgusted with myself. And I felt horrible because I didn’t want him to feel bad, because I really don’t like hurting people at all. She comforted me, telling me it was a stupid mistake. I asked her not to tell the mother, and she agreed. She was a little annoyed I locked myself in a bedroom with a guy, but I really didn’t think about that like that at all at first. She was really glad that I declined him trying to sleep with me.

 God I feel so so so gross and so awful. If this is what kisses are like I never want to do it again. I feel like simple kisses on the cheek from my family are going to be ruined because of this. And I feel horrible because I’m so afraid I hurt somebody unintentionally and I didn’t even mean to do anything really I just wanted to kiss someone and my emotions just whirlwind-ed and my hormones flew out of control and the desire to just get the first kiss in my life over with was just so overwhelming. And I absolutely hated it so so much. I still feel completely awful.

c3x8j0	2019-06-23 01:04:18	SoftandPure	AITA for waking up late?	"Tldr at the end.

I've not been feeling well mentally for years, but I didn't want to pause school or something else, so I've been doing my best to do everything.

For the past years, I've been to a therapist and taking medications.

But, at the start of this school year, my parents (I'm under 18), decided to stop helping me.

They took away some of my medicines for no reason (they didn't talk to my psychiatrist), they refused to let me change my therapist, and they refuse to take me to my psychiatrist appointment.

This made me fall back into a state of feeling bad really often.

I went to school for the whole year, however, not regurarly. I have to admit I sometimes skipped class. And my parents were rightfully mad at me.

So, last month, school ended.
I passed. I have almost excellent grades.

Now I have a lot of time to work on myself, because my mental state is kinda bad, and this means, that among all the effects this has on me, I usually sleep too much during the day or too little during the night.

This means I end up waking up ""late"" (it's not really ""late"" because I don't have anything planned. It's because of a lack of a better word).

At first my parents were annoyed because I slept too little during the night, and I understand that.

But I've gradually been adjusting my sleep schedule, and now my only problem is that I wake up late.

My parents are now furious at me every morning.


TLDR: my parents stopped helping me for my mental health at the start of the year. I went through the school year with quite some missing days, but I passed with almost excellent grades. 
Now I'm on holiday, and still struggling with my mental health, but my parents still get mad at me for waking up late."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3x7o5	2019-06-23 01:01:57		AITA for not teaching my boyfriend how to drive?	"My boyfriend is currently angry at me because I won’t teach him how to drive. He is 18, lives with his mother, doesn’t have a job (when he did I would have to drive him to it & juggle my own schedule as well as his), and is a junior in high school (which is quite far away from his home). 

I told him that I don’t have the qualifications to teach him and if there are any damages to my car, I will have to face the consequences with my insurance company. I am not of age to let him drive me around with only a permit, and I have had my own license for less than a year! Not to mention I am also not a very good driver myself. 

I told him no. I can’t teach him. He is angry because he says I am the only one who can do it, since his mother supposedly won’t. I asked if his friend Kevin (who is more qualified) can do it but he says Kevin won’t, even though he refuses to ask him. 

I’m putting my foot down on teaching him to drive, and all the alternatives I’ve come up with he has refused. I feel like he’s creating an impossible situation where the only answer is that I teach him. 

It is not my responsibility and it is not legal or safe. I feel like an asshole but i always put him before me and in this case I am putting myself before his needs for both of our safeties. 

Am I the asshole? Should I just do it, despite the legal requirements and risks?

Not sure if I am making a bigger deal of this than it is. I love the boy but it’s stressful being the only person he can go to and letting him down."		1	0

Most of them are cool, and having support for a first time mom is great. Some of them are freaking me out though. They post FB statuses saying things like ""if I tell my kid to stay away from the stairs, I don't care if he falls down anymore. Maybe he'll learn this time"" which, yeah, everyone posts weird stuff on FB. Doesn't mean it's what they think.

They do it in person too. It's, like, the number 1 thing they'll talk about. I just don't think they're joking snymore, I think these mom's genuinely believe their babies are to blame if they get hurt and all they should have to do is say no and put out no further effort. My sister's started saying it too. In the last month I have not seen her once without hearing her say something like this.

My mom thinks I'm trying to stir up trouble where there is none, and to be fair my sister does get over sensitive when anyone comments on her parenting. She's the yelling, FB argument, blocking family type with this.

"A month ago, me and my dad were walking in the evening, and the conversation vered in the direction of listening, where I vented my frustration of them wanting me to always listen to them, but never doing the same in return. this makes me feel like I'm not part of the family, as my concerns are never taken into consideration. I almist went  into tears explaining how upset I was at it, and my dad promised to listen to me more. Well, it never happened. Yesterday, I just finished taking a shower, and hate gel in my hair when it's just dried. I brush my hair and my mom asks if I want gel in my hair, I say no. SHE COMES TWO MINUTES LATER SND PUTS GEL IN MY HAIR. I also like to keep my room very organised, and my drawers are. strictly for things that go in drawers, not for clothes. I have a closet where I put my clothes. My mom says she doesn't like MY CLOTHES IN MY CLOSET AND PUTD THEM IN MY DRAWER IN MY ROOM BECAUSE SHE DOEDNT LIKE IT. My mom also does this thing where she loves to yell at and command people, so she is upstairs on her laptop and yells at me, downstairs, go go look for my dad
she thinks he's in the basement. She has a phone that can call the basement in arms reach, but she has to make me get up from whatever I'm doing because she doesn't want to reach for a phone, her time is more important. My dad then tried to guilt trip me by bringing ulrelatdd matters. like my m gardening today to guilt trip me, but I told him it won't work because I know what he's doing. Rinse, repeat. I'm tired of this. They also make me put my phone away at bed, but my sister gets to watch YouTube until 4 because she's  a adult, but they tell her she's their kid and has to be home by 11. excuse me what the fuck. what are these double standards.

c3x3o8	2019-06-23 00:50:31	peppy_dee1981	AITA for calling my family out for not watching the dogs when I specifically asked them to?	"Ok y'all, AITA? Before I went outside to sit with my mom, I told 3 kids (20,16 & 13) and my bf (50's) to watch the dogs because I was going outside to sit with my mom because she came over for supper. They didn't. Both dogs got into the dog food bin and gorged themselves on the feast within. Now I'm laying here, worried that their stomachs are going to flip because they're both super friggin full. 

I held my tongue until my mom and the oldest left, but then as I was putting the puppy (10 months) outside (45 minutes had elapsed since the dogs did it) I said from the back door, ""Well, you're going into the kennel, since I can't trust anybody to ACTUALLY watch you, even though everybody said that they would!"" And put the older dog (6 years) in the kennel while I went outside to make sure the puppy pooped. Meanwhile, my bf asked what I said (he's partly deaf) just before going outside, so I said it louder so that they could all hear me WELL. I just came back inside, grabbed my phone and book and took the dogs to bed with me. Told the kids to get ready for bed and closed my bedroom door.

I'm going to be up all night with dog shits now. Literally every time I ask them to do anything it's either shoddily done, not done at all, or they say it's been done, but nobody has moved an inch (like they are literally in exactly the same position as before I asked them to do it.)

c3x39j	2019-06-23 00:49:21		WIBTA if I claim to have a rare disorder that I haven't been diagnosed with?	"About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with an allergy to a common ingredient. My symptoms have never presented like a normal allergy and my doctors have never been able to explain why. I've never felt like ""allergy"" was the right word (and I've had doctors say the same) but it's never really mattered - I just don't eat the food. If I do eat it by mistake I can become too sick to leave the house and my symptoms can last for up to a week.

The ingredient is commonly used in restaurants and not listed on menus so any time I eat out I have to ask the waitstaff to check with the kitchen. It's common for waitstaff to question whether I'm actually allergic to the ingredient, ask about my symptoms, etc. It's also common for me to be given the ingredient by mistake and then have waitstaff brush it aside by saying I don't appear to be having a reaction. 

I recently learned of an *extremely* rare disorder that exactly matches my symptoms and triggers (so far I've only found records of a few cases). I have every symptom listed and I don't have any significant symptoms that aren't. I've also dealt with two other unexplained issues (symptoms without a well-defined cause) that are both symptoms of this disorder. I'm generally against self-diagnosis before seeing a doctor but this is the first time I've read an explanation that seemed to fit my experiences. I plan to try to get tested to see if I actually have it but I'm not expecting to know any time soon. 

I'm tired of having to explain my ""allergy"" to waitstaff and worrying that they're not taking it seriously. I'm hopeful that I would have fewer problems saying something like ""it's not an allergy but I do have a serious medical condition where I can't eat it. Please just treat it like an allergy"".

WIBTA if I claim to have the disorder in the meantime when dealing with people who are preparing my food? 

TL;DR: WIBTA if I claim to have an extremely rare disorder that I haven't been diagnosed with if I'm doing it to avoid being fed something that makes me sick? I'm trying to get tested to confirm and wouldn't continue to say I have it if it's confirmed that I don't."	Not the A-hole	1	0

Today, my brother was riding my old mountain bike and I was riding his BMX bike. He always goes ahead of me, which caused a problem today. I can make it up all the hills in our neighborhood, but he usually can’t, and if he does, then he does so very slowly. 

On this one particular hill on our route, I always pass him. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. And he goes to the left of the sidewalk EVERY TIME. Except today. 

I rode up behind him yelling “Look out, look out, look out,” and instead of moving off the path to the left like usual, he went to the right, where I was, and we crashed. Neither of us was hurt, and neither of our bikes were damaged at all. 

We both got really mad at each other. He said I treated his bike, which was very expensive and which he paid for himself, like shit. I said that it was an accident and that I didn’t ask to use it, he offered it to me. He said I should have passed on the left, which is customary here in the States. I said I thought he was going to move to the left side of the path like he has done the other 100 times we have done this.

"I am on a two week business trip to Orlando (sorry throwaway for obvious reasons). I am here with my best work friend meeting potential clients. For the most part we are exhausted after work and have had one drink at the bar then passed out to wake up and do it again. 

Last night we decided to cut loose just a little bit and we went off the resort property to a more local bar down the road. We were minding our own business when this group of guys started clearly hitting on us. They were Fun and funny and my friend dances with a couple of them (she's single) but between the two of us we more found it amusing that these guys probably got in on fake ID, we were 29 and 31 and looked like we'd been put through the ringer after making 5 brutal sales calls that day. It was even funnier because there were girls their own age all over rhe bar but apparently these guys thought the ""Cougars"" were a sure thing.

I'd had a few drinks (buzzed) but I'd promised my husband I'd call him at 9 to check in. I told him about my day, he told me about his and he'd had a miserable day and said ""please cheer me up."" I told him how funny it was that these 19 year old group of 6 guys was hitting on us and how ridiculous it was. He got sternly serious and said ""what are you talking about?"" I said no it's not a big deal at all, just silly. We were leaving to the hotel by 10. He said ""just show them your tits Bailey, you know you LOVE the attention."" And hung up. I tried to text and call him 1000 Times but no answer. I was heart broken that he spoke to me like that. 

I went back in the bar and just started hammering back the drinks. Maybe an hour later I grabbed the ""cutest"" guy and told him to come outside with me. In the parking lot I told him ""my husband said i should show you my tits and i don't want to let my husband down."" So I grabbed up my shirt and bra and flashed this guy my breasts. He said somthing like those are Amazing and better than his girlfriends. I said cool and we went back inside. Nothing else came of it. We continued to drink and dance until closing and I was so hung over today that I'm just now coming to reality. My husband has not called and I have not called him so I have no idea where we stand.

But back to the issue, please help me clear up my head...was I the asshole for flashing this guy? Or can I say I was in weird spot and did a weird thing and not an asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

My sister doesn’t have a car and doesn’t wanna learn how to drive, so I am usually the one to give her and her friends rides. Most of her friends usually live 3-10 minutes away from my house. There’s this one friend though that lives about 20 ish minutes away and I don’t like to give her rides, one it’s too far and I’m not going to hang out at her house like other friends I give rides to, it’s always been pick up and drop off only at her house, so it seems pointless to give a ride to this person one because gas (I shouldn’t say gas since I have a four cylinder but still I ain’t doing shit at her house when I drop her off). And two I don’t like her anymore, she has other friends that are total bitches, and sometimes it makes my sister and I frustrated but my sister still likes her and excuses her a lot.  I grew a pair and just told my sister and her that I don’t wanna give her a ride because she lives far, her friend texted me and asked me if I could give her a ride if she gave me money, I said no again. My schedule was packed enough, I had two places to go to that I planned days ago, go to a fundraiser and a small hangout with my sisters friends (not affiliated with the friend that wants a ride) it was already about 30-35 minutes of driving to both places from home and back. 

After saying it’s not about the gas, it’s about the fact of distance and time she brings up the fact that I drive everyone around and that I never complained all those other times. 

I’m gonna level with all of you I’m a big fucking pussy, I can never say no to someone because I feel bad, but now that I saw that the only reason I’m driving this person is because they have no other ride and I hate driving all the way to her house to pick her up and drop her off I told my self I don’t wanna drive this person around so I won’t. Also all those other times I drove people around is because they live close to me, and the places I took them were to parties where I participate as well and it was worth driving that distance cause I’m gonna have fun with other people and shit.

She responded with “me living farther than you is something I can’t change” ok fine, she got a point but I still don’t wanna drive that far anymore, cause it’s only to drop her off, like it’s pointless to me, having to drive that far just to drop off this person I don’t like, I’d rather much drop off this other friend that lives three minutes away from me and would probably let me in there house and rest for a lil. So she lives far and can’t do anything, well I’m not gonna drive that far anymore just to pick and and drop off. 

So am I the asshole for not wanting to drop off this person who lives 20 minutes away from my house despite me dropping her off and going to even farther places making me look like a hypocrite? Even though I learned how to grow a pair and say no?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

It honestly hurts my feelings to watch her straight up say that they are all too young and that their girlfriend is going to leave them cause their relationships means nothing. I get that a lot of teen relationships are just ways to pass time but I can tell these guys really care and here is my grandma being extremely rude. I confronted my grandma saying how things have changed and that if they finally find someone they feel close to and feel comfortable with. I felt my grandma should at least support it. My grandma was married at 17. She’s really being a hypocrite and I called her out for it.  My mom said this isn’t my place to say anything and that my cousins can go a couple weeks without touching their girlfriends til my aunt and uncle are home. I support like no closed doors, no sex ,and stuff but they can’t even hug with my gran around.

c3wovi	2019-06-23 00:09:44	Valiaraa	AITA for not wanting to stay at my half-sister's wedding party?	"Background: I only have half-siblings. My dad had a daughter(30ish by now) and then a son(22 I think) with another woman. My mom had a set of boy twins(25) and a daughter(20). They only had 1 kid together, me(17). 

My dad's kids never really were around since they were with their mom. I saw my brother a couple of times during summers when I was younger, but I never saw them for years unless I briefly saw them at a party. I grew up with my mom's kids and so I feel closer to them and consider them my full siblings. My siblings on my dad's side only visited when it was convenient for them or they need something from our dad. They never tried to have a relationship with me.

My half-sister got married when I was really young and I remember being there bc it wasn't a big thing. It was at their house and not connected to the church. She had two daughter since then and recently decided to get married through the church, have her eldest daughter's first communion and her youngest's baptism at one big party in our town. They drove down(they live like 50 min away) to give us an invitation and ask my dad if he could help them get some hay for decorations. No problem.

But the party falls on my friends birthday and they are also having a party. I am gonna go to my half-sister's wedding party, but I'm going to leave early for my friends party. I don't see anything wrong with it since I'm going for a while and there are going to be plenty of other people there. I also just don't want to have to put on a show of being close to them when they literally didn't even go to my high school graduation(a week after they gave us the invitation and I told them about it when they were here) or the party for me and my 2 cousins who also graduated. But a lot of people and family have said that it's uncalled for to leave the party and I should just stay for the whole thing and miss my friend's party.

Due to an accident I don't have a car right now it's at the shop. 

Today one of those days. I asked him after work to ride with him to his house because I had no ride, his response was they need time with his girl to relax and get ready for the trip for a few hours so I should go after they leave, I'm upset I haven't said anything. 

My parents knew what I had to do and I had a very early appointment so I had to get up at 5 a.m. I asked my father if he could pick me up from work so I don't carry with me clothes and laptop bag and whole bunch of stuff with me before hand. He said ok after they return from the beach. That was 8 a.m. this morning they were getting ready for the beach. They don't make it there until 1pm why? My mom takes hours to get ready for anything. 4pm I call them tell mom listen when you get back just give my bag to my dad so he can drive me straight there instead of going back and forth. She said okay but we're going to walk first then head back. I agreed, after all I'm asking for a favor. It's now almost 8pm I thought by now they'd be home since they left the beach and I called my mom to ask her to put a couple of extra clothes for me in my bag. She was like yeah ok whenever we make it home because we're grocery shopping right now. 

I hang up the phone I don't even think she noticed since she was reading out loud ingredients. I'm livid. No consideration for anything.

My sister graduated recently and while my mother didn’t want me to go and she never stated exactly why she didn’t want me to go I still went to support my sister while we don’t have the best relationship I still talk to her and we get along pretty well as far as siblings go, so before we got to my sisters house my mother was yelling at me about taking too much time using the bathroom at a rest stop and how much time I’m wasting because I’m trying to ruin my sisters graduation, as soon as we got to my sisters house I obviously was very hurt by the whole situation so I stayed home and slept / cried. They came home and my mom started yelling at me saying I didn’t care about my sister and I’m just ruining it for her, fast forward to the next day of the big graduation and my mom offers to go get me tea so I won’t be as tired, she leaves and it takes her a long time to get back because of bad parking and she screams as me (again) for wanting to ruin my sisters big day and than my sister screams at me as well, I get dressed and go with my mother not wanting another big fight. She hates what I’m wearing and deems it inappropriate, it’s a dressy tank top, leggings and a very large chunky cardigan that flows to my ankles, she screams at me in public calling me trashy and only came for male attention. I stay with her, bare through it and even take pictures of my sister even though she ganged up on me with my mother. 
She always treats me badly. I do everything for her, I stayed with her in the hospital when she was getting surgery, I tell her I love her all the time, I’m the only one who buys her Christmas, birthday and Mother’s Day presents of which I just discovered she throws away. My question is, would I be an asshole for not taking to her ever again? Honestly, never again. I always hear “talk to your parents, you never know when they’ll pass away” and stuff along those lines.

c3wiuw	2019-06-22 23:53:27	JavZub96	AITA for refusing to attend to a concert with my (now ex) GF?	"I apologize in advance if my english isn't flawless, it's a second language.

Buckle up, it's a long one. So here we go. A couple of years ago I met this girl (I'll call her ""J""). J and I met at the High School graduation of my little brother, she is the cousin of one of my brother's classmates and she lives in a different town that is fairly two hours away from where I live. J and I started to date a couple of months after we first met and because of the distance, and the fact that I was working and studying, I could only go to her town to spend weekend with her biweekly. 

When we were getting to know each other I really made emphasis on my musical taste. I told her I enjoy almost every genre, and made emphasis in the fact that I REALLY despise ""Reggaeton"" (a fairly simple latin rhythm usually accompanied by mysoginist lyrics or absolute non sense) and ""Banda"" (a really popular mexican genre). 

So one good day she called to tell me she had a ""really nice surprise"" for me. I said cool, can't wait. Fastforward to the saturday of that week, when I arrived at her place, lo and behold, she had two tickets for a Reggaeton concert (Maluma, if you were wondering who was performing). She was really excited and I think she was expecting a cheerful reaction from me. 

I told her that I didn't want to go because I knew I wasn't going to have a good time, I really despise the genre and the general ambiance is a lot of ""whoring"". She proceeds to tell me she spent her savings to buy those tickets and that I was being an ass for rejecting the invitation. To solve the situation I voluntered to redeem her for the tickets and then take her somewhere else. She ignored my suggestion and went with a girl friend of hers. 

I was consulting with my friends and relatives and some of the say I was an asshole for not sucking it up and join her in an activity I really hate and some other say that I was right by putting my foot down.

So, guys, I ask you, AITA for refusing to accompany my GF?

PD. We didn't break up for that, we broke up about a year later for totally different reasons.

TL;DR: GF secretly bought tickets to a concert of a genre she very well knew I hate and got mad because I refused to tag along."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3whlu	2019-06-22 23:50:05	turtleterrace12	WIBTA if I cut off my best friend after they frequently cancel plans despite justifiable reasons?	"I’m planning to cut off all contact with my best friend soon, and I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing or if I’m being hypocritical for my reasons. 

For context:
My (16F) and best friend, Lilian, (16F) have been best friends since 7th grade, and we’ve had a strong friendship. But that waned once I moved and we had less contact. We started texting less, and our texts would become days apart. When we did meet up though, I would feel incredible during and afterwards, and she said so too. But, our meetings are far and between, and she cancels quite often. She says it’s because her parents don’t let her go anywhere, that they don’t like to drive, that they feel lazy that day, or that the drive is too far. In response, I pick locations closer that are more convenient for her, despite me not having very good means of transportation, (my mom doesn’t know how to drive, my stepdad won’t drive me because he’s at work and we don’t have a great relationship, so I take an Uber). 

Even though we are good friends, I feel insecure about this. I feel like some reasons she gives for not meeting up or texting back aren’t genuine. This is mostly because she talks about visiting with other friends and etc all the time,and her parents let her. With me, however, she says her parents don’t want her to see me for some reason. She says it’s because she thinks they don’t like me and they think that I’m a lesbian or something. (I honestly don’t know where that came from?)

As an explanation for her sporadic texts, she says it’s because her phone isn’t working and she doesn’t receive the texts until a few days later. I kind of don’t buy that. It’s to the point where I feel like she’s making excuses to not face the fact that she isn’t interested in our friendship anymore. I mean, at first, i didn’t mind because I’m not a frequent texter either. But, the infrequency of her texts are sometimes a bit agitating when we’re trying to plan things. A difference between her and I is that I try and do respond a lot more quickly when we are planning things to make it more convenient and quick. However, sometimes she responds a confirmation that she’ll be going a few hours before the date we’ve set. 

It was the final straw when we were making plans recently. I had three days off work last week, and I announced to her that I’d wanted to make plans with her on those days. She responded that she was interested, then I asked her what day and time would be best. She responded late in the afternoon on my final day off and said she was busy. What the fuck dude? 

At this point, I feel like our friendship is dead, and there’s no point of talking anymore. She won’t call it off, so I will to at least have closure.

So, WIBTA if I cut her off?

EDIT: 

When I think about it more,  why I think I’ll be an asshole is not only because of this but also because we had plans in the future to live together and go to college together. The future we had planned involved both of each other heavily. She has also been struggling with depression, and she says she confides in me the most and trust me the most, so I’m reluctant to cut her off. Even then, I still feel like I should because I feel like she doesn’t help me when I’m going through hard times. She also makes me feel guilty for talking about my problems because she says that she has no right to complain when I have it worse."	No A-holes here	0	0
c3wgr6	2019-06-22 23:47:43		AITA bc I don’t want to go to dinner where my fiancé suggested	"Am I the asshole because my fiancé approached me and said “ hey I want to do something nice for you, how about I take you out to dinner my treat. We can go to that Thai place we always go? Or red Robbin?” 
I suggested maybe a different place because I’m not really in the mood for Thai or burgers and really just want a steak with blue cheese ( which is what I was going to prepare for dinner and it’s been marinating) and I said I was already making dinner but it’s no biggie we can just go out how about this new place we have never been. He says he wants to go out to dinner and not stay in which is okay. 

Apparently now I’m the asshole because my fiancé is mad at me for not wanting to go where he wants to go even though he said he wanted to do something nice for me and take me out to dinner. I just don’t understand because I thought since he wanted to treat me and go out to dinner we could try a place I wanted to go instead of where he wanted to go. If he wants to go out to dinner to a place,  we can go but I don’t want him to dress it up and say he’s doing it for me when he’s actually doing it for himself.

"My (27) girlfriend (22) and I are in a long distance relationship, we see each other at weekends maybe 2 or 3 times a month. She has just started as a tattoo apprentice. For a long while she hasn't had much time to draw for work never mind for pleasure. 
I've just found out that yesterday, while she was on the train to visit me. A guy she's never once mentioned around me (who looks very much like her 'type' and that she's apparently known him for a while) was speaking to her about a photo she posted months ago and 'only just found out she is a tattoo apprentice' and told her to draw him... And well, she did. 
I've asked her to draw me something before when she's been bored or didn't know what to draw, nothing huge just whatever she wanted and she's always gotten angry telling me she has no time or doesn't want to. 
Am I being unreasonable for being mad and upset that she drew this random guys portrait? A portrait of all things, not just an idea for a new tattoo or anything else but the fact she spent time studying a photo of his face and drawing it as soon as he asked? 
Idk, maybe I am over-reacting but to me this is really upsetting. And ofc she got mad at me for saying this to her."	Asshole	1	0
c3wgbn	2019-06-22 23:46:35	atx78660	WIBTA for reporting a coworker for repeatedly using the accessible stall	"Background: I’m in a wheelchair. Have been pretty much all my life (with the exception of when I was a child—progressive disorder. But I digress). I honestly don’t expect any special treatment but I am glad the ADA exists and companies/businesses have to have handicap parking spots, ramps, accessible stalls, etc. 

In my office building, there is 1 accessible stall per floor. And it is clearly marked with a blue sign (similar to those you see on the poles in parking lots). By and large, I never have issues when I go into the bathroom. It’s usually vacant and I am able to go in and do my business. 

The problem is: literally every time someone is in there and I end up having to wait (sometimes squirming), it’s the SAME guy that keeps using it. He is athletic, and I don’t want to make any assumptions, but he doesn’t seem to have any physical impairment that would cause him to need the extra space and grab bars that reside in the accessible stall. I also would be understanding if all the stalls were occupied and he really needed to go, but more often than not, there are plenty of other stalls open. 

I was griping about this to another coworker, and I was describing what the guy looked like, and he said “Oh, you mean John?”  So I have the guy’s name now. Part of me wants to look him up in the company directory and go have a quick word with his manager. John gives off a strong standoffish vibe so I’m not sure if a direct conversation would be beneficial—and again, the sign is right there in your face as you open the stall door. And he has seen me the numerous times I’ve been outside the stall waiting. So he knows what he is doing and presumably doesn’t seem to care. 

Help me out here, Reddit. WIBTA if I reported him? I know it’s not “my” stall, but I’m one of the very few who actually need it."	No A-holes here	0	0

I seriously just joined Reddit super recently and this my second post here so I'm sure I'm TA...

Last week a cat came up to me while I was on my porch smoking. I tried to shoo it, but I live on a main road in my town and it almost got hit right in front of me, so I took it in for the night. The next day the owners were walking around with fliers, I was at work, so my brother verified and gave them the cat. Four hours later she was back. The next day I went to the street they said they were on, knocked on 5 doors, nobody recognized her. Three days later (brother is home all day and we were waiting for owners to return) we waited until traffic was light, walked to her side street, and let her go find home. Someone else posted the next day (yesterday) that they found her. I messaged her, cat was not ok with her dogs, she brought cat to me.

Cat is sweet, nondestructive, and I have a vet appointment to get her fixed, updated on shots, and chipped this week.

c3wadm	2019-06-22 23:30:39	not_cinderella	AITA for wanting my parents to wait for me to have dinner and thinking it’s weird that they don’t?	"I kind of feel like this is a NAH situation but I could be wrong so I’m asking. 

I’m 20F and live with my parents as I go to school full time and work part time (2 days a week). Most nights I have dinner with my parents, although I follow a vegan diet and do all my own cooking whereas they eat meat. So basically I cook a separate meal from them (which they sometimes try) but will still eat with them at the table. 

On Saturdays, I don’t usually work unless my coworker who does close Saturday needs it off for some reason. Saturday nights I would work until 7. Other nights I work until 6 (we close at 6 all nights but Saturday is later). My parents will often drive me to work Saturday because I have my license but not my own car, and it’s not really fair for me to take their car to work all day when they need it for errands and such. Totally fair I get that. 

What kind of bothers me and I wonder if I WIBTA if I brought it up: on Saturdays my parents (mom) will pick me up from work and then once we get home they immediately sit down and have dinner. I’ve asked them in the past if they wouldn’t mind waiting 15-20 minutes for me to get in the house and heat up my dinner too (on work days I don’t make dinner from scratch I just reheat leftovers) so we can all eat together. A few times my parents have agreed, but most of the time they grumble or say they can’t wait. They always make things on these nights that can just sit a little longer; it’s not like a pizza that will burn if it sits in the oven longer - think like a stew or soup or things you often let simmer for a while before eating. 

AITA for wondering what 15 more minutes really is and why they can’t wait for me? It seems to me a tad odd to be so adamant about eating the second we come home and not even waiting for me for 16 minutes to eat with them, especially since I wait for them if, say, I’m hungry at 6 but my parents are out somewhere and aren’t going to be home until 6:30, or their dinner isn’t going to be ready until X time. They expect me to wait and get mad if I don’t, yet they don’t wait for me. WIBTA for pointing this out? Am I reading too much into this or is this a little weird - would most families just wait?"

So my family (Me, two brothers, Mom and Stepdad) always go on vacation every summer. I love going to different places and spending time with my family but we came at an impasse recently. This summer my mother and stepfather took off for vacation in three weeks and asked all of us if we’d like to go on another vacation. At first I was a little meh about it because I have a college summer class coming up and I was also wanting to go out of town with my friends a couple of weeks after the class was finished. So I talked to my mom about it after and told her I didn’t want to go. She was at first understandably a little shocked by it and then we got into an argument about how I was disrespectful to her and our family because I didn’t want to spend time with them. I tried to explain to her that no, I love my family and always enjoy spending time with them, I just didn’t want to spend 5 days at a beach and doing other stuff while I had other things I had planned like the summer class and the trip with my friends. And I for sure didn’t want to say yes and pretend like I was enjoying myself. I’m just having a hard time understanding why me saying no to one trip makes me all of sudden disrespectful to my family when I don’t want to waste their money and just don’t want to go.

c3w8hm	2019-06-22 23:25:26		AITA for not wanting to babysit my roommates dog?	"Quick background. About 6 months ago I moved in with my friend and his wife. They also have a 1 year old husky.

For whatever reason ever since the move the dog is constantly on guard against me. Anytime I am within sight of her she will start barking at me. She has never been aggressive but will not shut up anytime she sees me. At first I assumed she just had to get used to me but were going on 6 months and she is still showing the same behavior. Normally this isn't a big deal since my room is on the second floor so I dont have to interact much. I've tried hanging out a bit to get her to like me but I've since basically given up.

Anyways they keep the dog in a kennel most of the day and I used to let her out when I got home and then head up to my room. About a month ago though she ripped up the couch when no one was looking so i dont do that anymore.

 Lately though my roommates have been asking me to let her out and watch her for about an hour. Under normal circumstances this would be totally reasonable but with how the dog acts towards me I get very anxious being alone with it when all I wanna do is relax when I'm at home. Occasionally she'll calm down when I'm sitting up but anytime I make a sudden movement she wont shut up. 

I have diagnosed anxiety so really cant tell how unreasonable I'm being for not wanting to do this. I've explained my feelings to my roommates and they've basically told me I should use it as an opportunity to spend more time with the dog so she'll get used to me. I really enjoy living with them so am trying my best to help in this situation."		1	0

c3w6ri	2019-06-22 23:20:49	Ladydivacup	AITA for using the same pot I boil my diva cup in, to cook?	"I’ve been dating this dude for 5 months. We get along well and everything is going great! - Or was, until today. 
 
I ended my period Friday, and boiled my diva cup this morning. I put it on about 10am (after my shower where I washed it). After, I turned the heat off, poured out the water, and left the pot on the burner so the cup would cool down before i put it away - to avoid burning my fingers.   
 

 I ended up forgetting about my cup.  (Not that I was trying to hide it from boyfriend anyways)
 
My boyfriend came over. First thing he does it goes to the kitchen to get something to drink. He took a while in the kitchen so I yelled at him to ask what he was doing. He yelled back “uh ... what’s in this pot?”. 
 
I explain and he just seems disgusted. He asked if I ever cooked him a meal in this pot and I said I wasn’t sure but probably. We go back and forth. I pull up the website to prove it says to boil the cup after use. He said that if a TP company told him to boil his toilet paper after use he’d just ignore it. He said I put him in danger by possibly contaminating his food with period blood ... mind you I clean the cup out before boiling! Boiling is just to kill bacteria, I guess?   
 
 
I can kind of see his point, but I don’t think boiling the cup contaminated the pot. I can’t find anything about it online either.
 
Anyways, AITA for not having a separate pot to boil my diva cup in? 
 
Edit: I also clean the pot after boiling. 
 
Edit: I’d also like to clarify that when the cup goes into the pot, it has no blood. It’s already been cleaned. Like it’s just clear silicon. I wanted to mention that because some people seem to imply otherwise. 
 
Edit: I’ve used all my smaller pots (2) to do this. Should I just toss them?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3w5vz	2019-06-22 23:18:25		AITA for putting salt on my girlfriend's cooking?	"My girlfriend is a professional chef. She went to a good culinary school and is talented enough to be head chef at our local country club. She takes pride in her work and for good reason. She is a very good cook.

My girlfriend decided to make dinner for us last night. Usually, she does not cook for us because she spends all day cooking and would rather not have to do it when she gets home. So, she either suffers my attempts at cooking or we order out. In our 5 years of being together, I can honestly say that she has cooked for me less than a dozen times. Anyways, back to last night...

My girlfriend is making dinner for us. She made seared steak, grilled asparagus, and mashed potatoes. My girlfriend does not take any shortcuts when cooking. She uses fresh ingredients and makes everything from scratch. I don't intervene with her cooking so I don't know exactly what goes into it. All I know is that it tastes good.

Fast forward a bit and we are now starting to eat. Everything tastes good, but I felt like the mashed potatoes needed salt so, I salted them. I continue eating not even knowing she had noticed. She gave me one of those ""notice me"" kind of coughs/throat clears so I look up and she is glaring at me. I ask if everything is alright and she asks me what I just did. She said that everything had been flavored and seasoned the way it should be and that the potatoes didn't need salt.

I apologize and say that I wasn't trying to disrespect her, I just felt like they needed salt. She responds by saying that I don't know how food is supposed to taste and that I don't have a ""trained tongue"" so I shouldn't have touched them. I apologized again and that was the end of it but, dinner was finished in silence.

This has been on my mind since it happened. I'm really trying to put myself into her shoes but I honestly don't see how I did anything wrong here which is why I am asking here.

c3w4vy	2019-06-22 23:15:40		AITA for not liking my dads fiance?	"So my bio dad got engaged a few months ago. I was kind of happy for him, and I couldn't wait to meet his new fiance because I heard nothing but good things about her from my bio dad. 

My bio dads fiance, who we will call Belle, however, doesn't really seem like a nice person. Her demeanor seems to be kind of fake, and I feel like she's pretending to be nice to me. I say this because she doesnt really seem to be happy seeing me, and she did insult me the last time me and my dad and her video chatted. (This occured when bio dad was out of the room.)

Also, the first time me and her met, she was being kind of creepy, as me and her didn't really know each other at the time and she was saying stuff like what color I wanted my room to be when I came over to their place to the summer.  (Again, strangers in this point in time.) She also seems to be kind of controlling because she seems to be attempting to control what my dad says to me when we video chat, and shes pretty much invaded his facebook page. 

Because of this, I'm not really sure if I should go over, as I am not sure if the way that I will be treated when I am over there will be good or bad (im thinking bad by the looks of it). Also, my mom doesnt really like her either but wants to leave the descision of whether or not to go over to to their place up to me. 

Lastly, I am asking if im TA here because I kind of feel like I'm judging her, and I don't really like judging people, and I do feel like I want to give her a chance."		1	0
c3w4po	2019-06-22 23:15:12	itcarriesonman	AITA for asking my husbands coworker to pay for a dress that I was planning on returning but could no longer?	"Some backstory: my husband and I recently made a bunch of bad investment and pretty much live paycheck to paycheck supporting our 3 sons and adopted niece (story for another time). 

We recently moved to a larger town (from a small one) as my husband found a better higher paying job. Don’t have any family or friends here. 

My husband got invited to a charity gala for work, which although was optional would not have been a good look if a new employee sat it out. We were not expected to donate any money, but it was a black tie event.

I had nothing to wear to this event, but he was insistent that I needed to come. I tried rental agencies but I’m a larger girl and nothing fit me right.

I went to a plus-size bridal type store and found a dress that fit me properly and looked stunning. I looked at the price tag and had a mini mental breakdown because it was so expensive. I’d been looking for so long and this was the only dress that fit. 

One of the sales assistants (a larger woman herself) took me aside and asked me what was wrong. She was so kind and offered me so much sweetness. She said that her manager would kill her, but she understood my situation and without outrightly stating it told me that the store had a 30 day full refund program. She implied that I could buy the dress and return it. 

I went to the gala and I looked amazing, my husband looked amazing and it was the first good day I’ve had in a while. I tucked the tag into the waist of my skirt, everything was going well until 

one of his coworkers said hello to me and whispered: u/itcarriesonman you left your tag on and she proceeded to pull it off. I felt my heart drop and I felt awful. I didn’t say anything right away, but I was devastated.

I took her aside later in the night and told her that I wasn’t planning on keeping the dress, I needed to return it and that our family was in financial trouble. I asked if she would be willing to pay for the dress. She refused. 

She was incredibly offended that I asked and so was my husband. He thought it was incredibly inappropriate for me to ask, but I thought it was even more inappropriate to pull on and tamper with someone else’s dress. So reddit AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c3w4dj	2019-06-22 23:14:16	RareConflict3	AITA for being upset at a guy for asking my boyfriend if it's okay to share a bed with me?	"
Some friends and I went to Vegas recently.  We are all early/mid 20s.  There were about 14 of us and we had 3 large hotel suites booked. Based on how it worked out, I ended up having to share one of the beds with a guy.  

Right before going to bed, this guy apparently texted my boyfriend, who was in another state, to ask for ""permission"" to share the bed with me. My boyfriend said sure as long as I'm comfortable with it.  I didn't know about this until the next morning.  When I found out, I immediately chewed him out and told him that this was not appropriate.  Women are not the property of men, and I am an independent person who is capable of making my own decisions about where to sleep without having to get his permission.  Some other people in the group told me to stop being a ""bitch"", so I decided to keep quiet for the sake of group harmony.  

So Reddit, AITA?  I know I'm a bit of a feminist, but am I justified in being upset?  Should I have just let this slide?"	Asshole	0	0

"So my downstairs neighbor loves to have parties all the time, even 2 or 3 times during the week. They will drink, scream, yell, sing, whatever in the backyard until 2 in the morning. I have to wake up at 2:30am for work, so trying to sleep through this isn't fun. I have asked her to please keep it quiet plenty of times or at least take it inside, she responds with just close the windows so you don't hear it. I have went to my slumlord of a manager and ask them to do something about it but yet they never have and I don't think they care to. So this past week I've been starting my motorcycle up right in front of her bedroom window to let it warm up and just before I pull out of the driveway I rev it up just to make sure it's fully warmed up of course. Yesterday she talked to me and told me I need to stop it and I informed her that there's something wrong with my bike and it has to warm up just a little longer than normal now. Am I the asshole for giving her a taste of her own medicine?

Should I have mentioned that it's not just the noise it's the fact that they leave broken glasses and broken bottles around the driveway and yard. My first concern is when my daughter comes over she likes to play back there but can't anymore and let's not forget motorcycle tires are expensive. I asked her if she could clean it up and was told ""don't you own a broom"". Also my other closest neighbor works graveyard so he isn't home for any of this."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3w2jb	2019-06-22 23:09:29		AITA For Firing My Cleaning Service?	"I have been using the same cleaning service for 10 years and have never complained.  I have been reasonably happy with their service. Earlier this week, I received a note from one of the cleaners that said (in very broken English) something like “Tap master bath …. sorry”.  We could not find anything wrong with any of the faucets in the master bathroom.  Later that night I discovered when you turned on the cold water on one of the sinks, some black goop came out.  After running the water more, it cleared.  I also discovered that the hot water had been turned off at the source.  

I emailed with the manager asking what happened.  She replied that it was broken when they got to the house.  I reiterated that I was not accusing anyone of anything, but I wanted to know what happened.  Was she saying that they walked into the room and it was just “broken”?  She only replied yes.  We emailed back and forth several more times - all I am asking for is an explanation of what happened.  

The last email exchange was the last straw, where she told me that they were changing policy regarding the interaction when there are “concerns”.  In none of the emails was there an apology (not even sure if I needed one…because I still can’t even get any sort of explanation about what happened).  After days of this, I have decided to fire them and use another service.  I think that not being able to tell me what happened is a violation of trust. My son thinks that I am being ridiculous and shouldn’t have fired them, so am I the asshole?"		1	0

M was the only boy at the party, so he didn't felt comfurtable going. He said he didn't wanted to go, so MA told him to leave the chat that was created for the party.

He left, and everyone got mad at him for deciding he didn't wanted to go. G added him again telling him to stop with that thing of ""I'm the only boy, so I don't wanna go"" and go to the party.

He declined, defending his point that he didn't felt comfortable with going. G said that she should have called me. M then said ""Call him, then! If he's there maybe I'll go"". G removed him from the group and started calling him an asshole.

She told me everything, trying to explain that he was the asshole, saying that she was crying the whole day and decided to make a party, but everyone treated her like shit.

c3vymo	2019-06-22 22:59:03	bluecheesethrowaway	AITA for refusing to eat my blue cheese burger standing up?	"Hear me out:

&#x200B;

I just learned that my bf hates the smell of blue cheese. Something I never knew.

I made us some burgers today and when I sat down to eat mine, he was playing video games and was suddenly extremely repulsed by the smell of my cheesy burger. He told me, and the guys (his brother and cousin) on his headphone, that my burger smelled horrible and that I needed to eat it someplace else. He said it was making him nauseous. (Can’t most people breathe from their mouths in stinky situations?). I was already halfway done with my burger and I refused to move elsewhere to eat it. I also eat very quickly and it wasn’t a huge burger.

We don’t have a dining table and usually eat our food at the living room, so my only other option was to eat it standing up in our kitchen, 10 feet away. I felt like since I took the time to make us food and he had already quickly eaten his sitting down, I was entitled to sit and eat my food. He says I was being rude by not eating it elsewhere because the smell made him feel sick, because he was in the middle of a game with his friends, and because he was playing before I made the food he asked me to make. So...AITA?

Btw, I don’t plan on using the cheese when he’s around anymore, but I genuinely am concerned that I was being an A in this situation, and I'm just not seeing it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

For anonymity purposes, I can only say we both work for the government where we make critical decisions that directly impact the lives of other people.

I recently became aware that my colleague has a history of Alzheimers in his family, affecting several members in his immediate and extended family. I have noticed over the years that he was becoming more forgetful but certainly not to the extent where he was unaware of his surroundings or identity.

I never had any intention of bringing this up as it didn't seem to affect his work. However, that changed recently when he was being considered as a candidate for a leadership position within our department.

If promoted, he would go from making decisions, that are checked by superiors and affecting relatively few people, into a position where his decisions are essentially unilateral and could affect thousands.

I don't want to confront him directly about this as we are on good terms, he has been good to me in the past, I have no concrete proof he is even affected at all by Alzheimers, and he will also be my new boss (self-preservation).

As for how I know his family was affected in this way, I first heard rumors then joked with him about it where he confirmed that many members in his family were afflicted.

There is another side to this internal conflict of mine.

He is divorced, no relationships, his wife and children have left the home (they parted on good terms, but he only occasionally gets to see them, and he's paying his ex-wife child support and alimony) and this job is basically all he does (first to be here, last to leave). I'm worried about what he'll do if he loses his job, and stays home all day staring at four walls. This is on top of throwing a wrench into his finances, as he would still have to pay alimony and child support (not a lawyer, it's just what I think would happen).

Personally, I am leaning on the side of no, leave things be. On one hand, there is significant personal risk to me for speaking out, even if I was right, I'd be a pariah for this. If I was wrong, ooooh boy...

He's been a good friend to me, and the only reason why I'm even considering this is because if promoted and found mentally incompetent later, our powers-that-be will most likely cover this up in order to avoid embarrassment whilst thousands of people may be placing their faith in a single person who can't remember who they are.

I begged him to decline and just take the flight he already has because 1) I didn't want to wait any longer to see him and 2) I'm picking him up at the airport so I didn't want to have to pick him up at 4 or 5 am instead of midnight (which is when the current flight lands). Basically a 100% selfish move. He didn't call me an asshole or anything and actually seemed super chill about it - he said ""you're right is not worth it to see you way later"". But I strongly feel like an asshole. He could have had a $400 cheque in his hands if I had made this small sacrifice. Also it is definitely too late for him to change his mind and take the later flight at this point because I think he has already boarded his plane as I type this. 

&#x200B;

The only thing I can think of in my defense is that I actually had a previous boyfriend who was compensated $600 for the same thing, but he had to phone the airline for months and it wasn't until over a year or more later that he finally received the money. It also wasn't money in his pocket but was money towards a flight or food/hotels supported by the airline.   


What do you guys think? Maybe this is a small matter but also $400 is not a small amount of money in my opinion. I feel like a pretty crappy gf right now.

c3vxq2	2019-06-22 22:56:41		AITA for looking through my new boyfriends emails?	"My new boyfriendish guy needed to sign into his email on my phone to get access to his email when his phone was dead. He needed to see something that his landlord sent him.

I've snooped through his emails. Really, I just wanted to learn more about him. It wasn't malicious, just, curiosity I guess. I wasn't looking for anything specific.

I feel like a lot of people would think this is wrong, invading the privacy of someone. I won't argue that technically he gave me access - he did, but, when he signed into my phone that wasn't the intended purpose.

I feel like I've learned a lot of useful things. I know that his financial situation isn't the best. So now, despite his efforts and instance to spoil me, I know that, really, he can't afford it comfortably, and we can do more low key activities. I know the kinds of music tastes we share in common, so I can impress him just a little by revealing that a little bit sooner.

I know of certain topics to avoid... I know some conversation pieces.

I know that the response might be that it's an invasion of his privacy, but what does that mean? Is it really doing any damage? And certainly could do some damage if I wanted (email his employer? Mess with his family affairs?) but there's absolutely no incentive to do that.

What do you think?

Given the opportunity, do you think most people would do a bit of snooping like I've done? I got into a spat with a friend over this, she thinks I'm absolutely insane. I feel like that's harsh? I feel like I'm satisfying normal curiosity, that a lot of people might want to fulfill given the opportunity.

For clarification, I *certainly* do not think anyone else has culpability but me here, I certainly would say he's the asshole, he's done nothing wrong. But I don't feel that anything in the utility of what I'm dong is really wrong."	Asshole	1	0

c3vvgq	2019-06-22 22:50:39	md-25	AITA for cheating my manager on deadlines?	"Here's the deal and a TL;DR: I signed up for a data scientist job and got a Dilbert role.

First assignment was a red flag: can you make us a robot that crawls the web for news related to certain keywords and classifies them by relevance, according to our definition of relevance (politics) ? Would be cool to also have news for the past two years. Guys, that's how Google News works, I can't promise that I'll deliver that by myself on a reasonable deadline because of: infrastructure, human resources, expertise.

I've explicitly told my manager that I deliberately stalled a deadline on behalf of my team because, well: they want to have good management practices on a sector that is known for crappy management (government). They wanted time tracking on tasks such as reports to have a Service Level Agreement. 90% of reporting time is sourcing information and getting someone in government to tell you where to look for the info you need. The team (technical assistants to a politician) told me that was a bad idea. It would stop us from doing good research and focus on delivery time. This time tracking task on a google sheet was actually completed in a cople of hours in Apps Script, mostly because my programming skills are in R, Matlab and Python and I had to look up the docs.

After looking at the spreadsheet, my manager told me that what she really wanted was to use trello, but upper management decided that was unfeasible because we would need to pay for trello to have reporting. Pulling json data into a spreadsheet is an easy task, I need the same script and every team member's API keys and can pull this off in a couple of minutes by copypasting someone else's code from github. If we're tracking time, we can pull timesheet report spreadsheets from Clockify anyways. What I think will happen is: buuut data scientist, what if someone logs a task in Clockify instead of Trello? would they sync automatically? I don't see why people cannot be given instructions on how to log their time and place a spreadsheet into a drive folder monthly. It's a fucking 8 people team and I'm given week long projects because people aren't supposed to click places. The Clockify + Trello integration can be made by a Zapier.

I feel like an ungrateful asshole because well, I do get a Data Scientist salary. However, I'm not learning anything besides how to google shit efficiently and lie to people. I have a STEM degree and mathematical modeling and programming experience, I don’t want a glorified IT support role. A reasonable course of action, albeit unethical, would be to keep delivering easy stuff to my manager and create the illusion of progress, while I'm actually working on something that improves my development skills.

I started working for a tech company a few months ago.  Things have not really clicked for me here, and I don't particularly like it - it's not the worst place I've ever worked by any means, but I really can't find anything I really like aside from the compensation aspects.  I don't gel with the rest of my immediate team, I'm not in love with the tech after getting more experience with it, and overall I just don't see myself staying here long term.

Last week, I had an interview with another company that I've almost joined a couple of times over the years, but the timing never worked out.  The hiring manager was practically ready to hire me on the spot, and the recruiter called me on the way home from the interview with a verbal offer.  We agreed to a tentative start date, and she said she'd get the written offer out asap, hopefully Friday (yesterday) or Monday, but it needed to go through the various levels of approval - this is a large, well known, multinational company, and sometimes these things just need to run their course.  

Needless to say, I was really hoping I'd have my written offer in hand yesterday, as Monday I have my one on one with my boss.  I'd like to just open up by telling him I have another opportunity I plan to persue, give my notice, and let the chips fall where they may.  I'm not about to tell him that without a written offer, though, and he tends to want to plan the next several weeks out in these meetings.

AITA for acting like I'm going to be on board for the foreseeable future, and then turning around and calling him the next day and telling him I quit?

c3vubs	2019-06-22 22:47:37	sicariusNOX	WIBTA if I get a tattoo for my bonus/stepson?	"I want to get a tattoo for my sons. I have two, my first son is my bonus son and then I have my first born. 

Bio-mom goes back and forth between hating and loving how much of an interest/how much I do for her son. We all (we being me, bio dad, and his family) feel that she wouldn’t be happy about it if she found out, but I don’t think it’s right or fair that I have to limit what I put on my body because of that. And it’s not like I would tell her or rub it in her face. I would, however, show my bonus son so the chance that she’d find out about it from him is there. 

I understand I have to be considerate of her feelings, and remember my place as a step mom and I do. But it’s not like she’d ever see it nor is it going to be obvious. I’m wanting to get their zodiac constellations, not their names. Nor am I wanting to add him to the tattoo just to spite her, it has nothing to do with her. He is very important to me and was, in a way, my first child and that’s the reason I wouldn’t feel right excluding him. 

I’ve been told it would be disrespectful and that IWBTA because I‘d do it even though I know it will upset her. Some people have said ask her, but I worry that might make it seem like I’m trying to rub it in her face or show off. If this needs to go in a different sub please direct me to the right place!

Edited for spelling.
Edit for INFO: 
He’s about to turn 9 and I’ve been in the picture since he was 5. We have a positive relationship and when I mentioned the tattoo to him in passing his response was “that would be cool.”"	No A-holes here	0	0
c3vu1e	2019-06-22 22:46:54	TimBob12	AITA for raising my voice at a child I don't know?	"Today I attended a local school fair with my girlfriend to promote our new princess party company. My girlfriend's costume had a fairly long cape. 

Early in the day a group of boys aged 8-10 decided it would be funny to put exploding foil bags that make a loud and startling bang under her cape without her knowing while she is crouching and talking to very young children.

Later the headteacher from the school came over and apologised and said she knew the boys involved, wasn't surprised they were doing it and had spoken to their parents.

Towards the end of the fair my girlfriend was posing for photos and talking to a very young girl. A group of boys put another exploding bag under her cape but I saw them doing it and shouted ""Oi"".

I managed to grab the bag before it exploded and as the boys ran off I shouted ""Oi"" again and one stopped briefly and turned around so I caught up to him and in a serious and loud voice said something along the lines of how stupid it is to do something like that at all, let alone while she's entertaining a young child.

The boy then protested his innocence saying it wasn't him that did the bag. He also conveniently didn't know who threw the bag. I then again said it was very stupid and he ran off and I shouted ""Behave!"" as he ran off.

I tried to find the headteacher to mention it but couldn't find her.

A bit later the mother of the boy I had shouted at approached me. I was expecting an apology but she started having a go at me for upsetting her son.

She said he is adamant that he didn't throw the bag but she admitted he might have been in a group, but that as he wasn't the one that threw the bag I shouldn't have shouted at him. I said ""I'm sorry but these are expensive costumes and she's entertaining very small children. It's an extremely startling noise and is just dangerous and rude.""

She then said I shouldn't be telling off other people's children. Especially if I'm not sure it was him that threw the bag. And that I shouldn't be singling him out when it was a group involved and that I've really upset her son. She seemed to be expecting an apology from me for upsetting her son and stayed for a good few minutes adamant that I shouldn't have shouted at her son for putting an exploding bag under the cloak of my girlfriends costume.

So obviously the kid was in the wrong. Whether or not he threw the bag he was in the group encouraging it and running away after planting the bag. But should I have shouted at him? Was there another way I should have dealt with it to make me less of an asshole?

I keep thinking that I should have said other things to his mother about keeping control of her son and how the bags they were throwing have age restrictions on them as well as safety warnings about throwing them at people. It's too late now but it's keeping me up.

c3vtm7	2019-06-22 22:45:48	neurophobias	WIBTA for not wanting another sibling?	"I created this account specifically to ask because my parents are acting like I’m out of line and I want to know if I’m unreasonable. Some backstory: I’m 15 with an older brother who’s 23 (he lives about an hour away from my parents and I). My uncle is ~50 and my potential new brother is 4.

About 5 years ago, my uncle (mom’s brother) started dating a girl who I’ll call Kacey. Kacey is around 30 and at the time I really had no issue with her, unlike my parents who seem to hate her. Around 10 months after they start dating they broke up. Everything was fine until about a month later when we found out that Kacey was pregnant with my uncle’s baby. He got back together with Kacey in order to raise the child. This caused a lot of issues at the time, but I was too young to remember much about it.

The baby was born and he was named Tristan. Apparently, he looked nothing like my uncle, and a DNA test showed that it wasn’t my uncle’s baby. My uncle and Kacey broke up and nobody had mentioned the situation again until yesterday.

Yesterday, my mom brought me into the living room and told me that Kacey had died of a heroin overdose. Since she was a single mom, there was no one to take care of Tristan (Kacey’s parents were dead and she had no siblings). After this, my mom tells me that she wants to take in Tristan and raise him as her own child. I’ve been an “only child” for the past 5 years since my brother has been away at college, and I don’t want to suddenly have a younger brother who isn’t related to me in any way. I also don’t want this sudden responsibility to be an older sister when I was completely unprepared. When I told her this, she got angry at me and started crying, saying I’m ungrateful and that I should help out this baby.

AITA for not wanting this extra sibling? My brother doesn’t know any of this is happening so I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this. Sorry if this post isn’t detailed enough, my parents are being really vague with me and I’ve been thinking of it ever since she told me :/"	Asshole	0	0
c3vsnn	2019-06-22 22:43:17	sicknastyjr2009	AITA for keeping all the money from selling our band van?	"Context: I’ve been in a band for 5 years with 3 other members. We’ve toured all across North America with this van. Only one original member who purchased the van with me is still in the band. We mutually agreed to end things as life got in the way.

To put it in perspective, I was the dad of the band. I literally did everything you could possibly think of. I found and bought the van, got it certified, insured, maintained. Booked all the tours, got all our working visas. All the other members had to do was pay up and enjoy the ride. When it came time to selling the van I specifically asked if anyone would be willing to help out with getting the van certified/find a buyer. No one said a single thing. All responsibility fell on my shoulders, as always. 

So here’s my dilemma, AITA for pocketing all the money I get from selling the van from the original member who also paid for a portion of the van? He hasn’t said or asked anything. It seems like he doesn’t give a shit so why do I owe him anything, if I did all the work?

Edit: Yo shout out to everyone giving their input. It put things into perspective for me. I’m gonna leave it be and if he decides to reach out then we’ll discuss a reasonable percentage for him to receive after the sale.

c3vrcm	2019-06-22 22:39:43		AITA for honking at the cyclist?	"Here's the scene. I'm driving to work and am in track to just barely be in time for my shift. I'm going 45 down a road that only has two lanes, with a solid yellow divider. In other words, my side only has one lane. However, there is a pretty wide shoulder of about 5-6 feet.

I see about 20 seconds ahead of me, there are two cyclists on their bicycles probably going a good 20mph slower than me. One of them is right in the middle of the shoulder, and the other is directly to the left of him by about 5 feet, cycling on the main lane. I don't want to bump into either, so I slow down to maybe 35 hoping they'll hear me and pack into the shoulder so I can pass them.

I wait and get closer, but no change. I'm getting pretty close, and I don't want to go into the opposite lane even though it's empty since it's a solid yellow line. I consider finding a way to alert the closest one that he should pack into the shoulder, and eventually decide to quickly tap on my horn. They could have fit in the shoulder side by side a little tightly, or they could have gone front to back. I figured a short honk would be the easiest way to alert them without seeming too aggressive. 

I do that, and he appears a bit startled and I feel bad. He nudges over, but is still in my lane, just a few inches to the left of the line marking the shoulder. I don't want to risk bumping into him, so I slow down, and he motions for me to just go into the other lane to pass him, which I do.

A few minutes later, I'm at a red light and the cyclists catch up. My window is down and one of them yells something at me that I can't hear. I feel bad because I think my honk may have startled him and caused a safety issue. I also may have come across as a reckless youngster because my windows were down and I was playing music out loud since it was an otherwise empty road. But also I think it was unreasonable for him to cycle on a main road and expect cars to accommodate him by swerving around and crossing a solid yellow line, even if the road was empty. AITA?"		1	0
c3vqxz	2019-06-22 22:38:37	Notababysitter765	AITA for not asking my brother to babysit	"Quick backstory

I'm a single mom of an 8 year old. My brother (42) recently separated from his wife after a 20 year marriage and since both of our parents passed away, we are our only family left. So while going through the separation and divorce process, he is renting a room from me in my house.

Now AITA

When he moved in, he was a mess, pretty sad, was blowing off work, wanted to talk a lot etc. he was just really emotional, I think most people get pretty emotional during a marriage breakdown. About a week after he moved in, my ex husband had a major work issue that caused him to not be able to take our son for his scheduled visit that night but would pick up the next morning, this has happened in the past but is rare, maybe about once or twice a year. Of course, my son was really disappointed and cried that he couldn't go to his dad's so I decided to try to make the best of it, I got him a pizza, we watched Ralph Breaks the Internet and let him stay up late. 

Unfortunately, I had plans with my boyfriend so I had to cancel. When I say plans, I was going to go to his house, we were going to make ramen and watch Netflix, so we weren't going to a big event or anything. Just hanging out plans. 

Anyway, I canceled and my boyfriend blew up and told me that my brother was selfish for not offering to babysit and that I should have made him since he's staying here. 

I was miffed because my brother pays rent, he pays for his own food, he's like a roommate and babysitting my son is not his responsibility. Plus, he was pretty emotional and watching my son was a last thing he wanted to do thing. 

I also felt that since his dad was busy with something really important like his job, I felt it was my responsibility to try to a disappointing night into something that would make it a little less disappointing and that includes spending time together.

When I told my boyfriend this, he said that was unfair and that it's obvious that I don't have my shit together because I'm not making him a priority. And that since my brother is staying with me, I should be able to come to his house more because I have ""a live babysitter."" 

I think this is skewed as fuck.

so it was my wife's 29th birthday last week and I took her to a fancy restaurant and covered the bed in rose petals and you can geuss the rest. 

she then told me that she also wanted to have a girls day with her friends and go bar hopping, this was going to be her birthday gift from her girl friends, I told her that it would be awesome and I hope she has a great time. 

now to add, we had a talk a while back about boundrys and we both agreed that strip clubs where a no go. especially strippers. 

she gets home at around 3 completely wasted and proceeded to pass out so I decided to wait until she wakes up to find out what happened, I then realised that I'm friends on snapchat with some of the girls she went out with. I went to view the snap story and was shocked, they had decided to head to a strip club and they got my wife a lap dance. she was clearly enjoying this guy swinging his hips at her. I was pissed off and decided to head to bed and talk to my wife about it in the morning. 

when we woke up i questioned why she went to a strip club and got a lap dance and she refused to answer me. 
I just felt so betrayed because all I could see was a guy grinding on my wife. 

so I kinda let loose and told her how disrespectful she is and that I feel so betrayed and unhappy, I explained that I cant look at her now withought seeing the guy who grinded on you. 
she never said anything throughout the whole speech, and it looked like she was not even listening half way through so I got up and told her I would be staying with my mum   

that caused her to start crying and apologizing, I refused to listen to her and went to my mums. 

my mum is happy to have me but thinks I overreacted, and most of my family/friends agree.

c3vnhk	2019-06-22 22:29:39	iCanKindaRun	AITA for suggesting going with my friends to another city for a presentation instead of with my mom?	"I’m a 19F international fashion student, studying in USA. Every 3 months I go back to my country for about 1-3 weeks. Right now I’m in my country (abbreviated MC) and leave July 5th for classes the 9th. 

I’m participating in a fashion contest in MC. I have to present a finished design from the collection on June 29th. 

This week we got notified the presentation has been changed to July 6th, in a city 4 hours away. The drive is tiring due to all mountains. 

My mom said that in any case, she and my sister would drive there and present the design for me. Didn’t really sound exited about it, just said it in a normal voice tone. I’m also going to try to change my ticket for the 7th or 8th. 

I hung out with 3 friends, and mentioned the problem. They said we could take advantage of the situation and go to this town close by, that we have been wanting to visit for months, but haven’t due to time/schedules. My mom has approved before. Then they could drive me to the presentation, and drive back early Sunday If I got the ticket changed.  I mentioned this to my mom. 

That was all yesterday, today she calls me and my sister me to her room and tells me she’d rather say her feelings to my face, instead of “gossiping” with my sister behind my back(Her words not mine).  

She goes on to tell me that she’s hurt that I would even CONSIDER going with my friends, and that she can’t believe how rude I’m being. 

I try to explain that I didn’t think she would mind but she cuts me off. She just goes on about how it’s “fine”, she understands I don’t want to hang out with her, just my friends (not true: I’ve been in MC for a week and only gone out twice with friends, rest has been with family), and when I tried explaining my pov she just shushed me in a very sarcastic way. Think of those girlfriends that tells the boyfriend “do whatever you want” but  DONT. 

My reasoning was that I could take a chance to have a small trip with my friends (that she’s never been against), saving her an 8 hour roundtrip, gas and hotel expenses (since one of my friends offered paying those). 

Of course I would love my mom supporting me through the nerves and spending time with her but I didn’t want to bother her. 

Now my mom’s like “I cared because it was something huge for you but clearly you don’t want me there, I understand that you don’t want us involved in your personal projects.” Which isn’t true. 

I wasn’t even saying I was going CHOSE that option, I would only go if she gave me permission(haven’t even changed the airplane ticket!) just putting it up as one of the possible solutions. I wouldn’t have mentioned my friends if she had sounded enthusiastic about us there going together.

I don’t know if I really fucked up or if it’s just my mom being passive aggressive and guilting me. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Okay so I'm kinda torn on if I was being rude about this so why not ask Reddit. 

So I went in to my gym today and decided I wanted to workout chest today. I saw the bench press was being used by a guy and a trainer, so I decided that I would do other chest workouts for now. Okay so after I finished one machien I decided to check if the bench was free. I saw that there was no one on it, but there was a towel so I went and asked the trainer if he was still using the bench and just left to get water. He said yeah, but the person he was training was on a different machine and he said they only have one more set on the bench to do. I said okay and went to do another chest exercise while I wait. After that was done I noticed that they still haven't used the bench press, so I asked if I could work in while they do other excercises. The trainer tells me no and to go do something else. I decided to just wait for them to finish (I wasn't right next to them I was a good distance from them just in my phone). Ten minutes pass and I go to ask if they are even going to use it. I came off pretty rude here. (By this time it has been at least 40 mins since I came in and first asked so I was pretty annoyed). After this the trainer started raising his voice and said ""Tough luck, get out if you don't like it. I'm not your fucking daddy"". After this I realized that I was being rude and I left. I know he shouldn't raise his voice, but I was pestering him. I was just pissed that he kept a machine for 40 mins and didn't even use it.

Almost always after I get angry at someone I feel extremely guilty, depressed, etc. I’ll be on medication by Monday that should help.

She does this a lot honestly. I’ll say something along the lines of helping myself and she makes some snide remark disguised as a joke. Then when I get upset and express that it hurt my feelings she half ass apologizes and it’s one of those “sorry you got your feelings hurt” kinds of things.

She helps pay some of the bills, so I'm not going to say she's sitting on her ass working for nothing.

However, since she's graduated highschool college hasnt really been on her mind. My parents always ask me when shell start trying to pursue it. I've spoken with her mother and she's on board and supports the idea. I've spoken with her about it and she's said she wants to, she just doesn't know how to start. I've offered numerous times to help her with it, and she's brushed it off as a ""okay, good to know"" kind of thing. I love her a lot, and I see a future with this girl, so obviously I'm not going to just tell her that if she doesn't go I'm ending the relationship.

I want her to have the education to help her land a good job later in life. She'd be a first generation college graduate if she went (I believe that's the right term), and I know itd help her out a lot in the future.

"So I am almost of age to start working in my state, and I was talking about it w my mom on what future job I was gonna have, where the paychecks would go to etc. She said that when I start to work for the first time, that some of my money will go to paying a bill of my choosing. I wasn't on board with this because in my opinion the money that I make when I'm working should either go to a savings account for me to access or for me to spend on things that I want, not to help out because imo it should be the parents responsibility to help pay for the things we need and not the child. 

We got into an arguement over this, and she pretty much said that if I didnt do it that I would either have to go live with my bio dad or I would have to move out when I turn 18 (Can't really remember what she said afterwards, deets are a bit fuzzy) and that she wants me to learn responsibility and/or what it would be like to live on my own as an adult. 

Ever since then, I've been thinking about whether or not im the asshole because while I would like to help out, im just not sure if i should do it in this way, especially since I want my money to go to the things that I want/need. So folks, AITA?"		1	0
c3vets	2019-06-22 22:07:24	sadd4ughter	AITA for resenting my mom's early retirement?	"First time poster, using a throwaway. Sorry for the long post.

**Background:**

My mom is a corporate lawyer, my dad is a diplomat. My parents weren't really ever around when I (18F) was growing up because of their jobs. Neither of my parents even took parental leave when I was born - my mom was back at work within a week of giving birth. I've never felt close to either of them.

I don't think it's unfair to say that I was raised almost solely by my nanny / housekeeper, Adola. Adola was hired when I was nearly 2, and she lived with us until I was 15, then she moved in with her sister who had just moved here (Canada) from their home country (Croatia). Adola still comes around once a week to clean and meal prep, and she is essentially like a grandmother to me. She is at all major holidays and family events.

When I was a kid I used to act out because of lack of attention from my parents. Adola recognized this, and always made sure to tell me that my parents loved me and that I should be proud that they were so successful and that they loved their work so much. I used this sentiment to comfort me as I grew up, and even became proud of their dedication to their careers as I grew older.

**The situation:**

Yesterday my parents hosted a party of about 40 family, friends, and co-workers. At one point my dad called for everyone's attention, and my mom announced that she is retiring at the end of the summer. Everyone was really happy for her, but I was really taken aback. My mom is only 45.

When the crowd dispersed from the announcement I pulled my mom aside and asked her why she would leave her job. She told me that she never really liked her job / working in general, and with their savings and my dad's salary, she felt comfortable to retire now. She also said that it was good timing now because I just turned 18 and am going to uni in September, so she doesn't have to spend her retirement ""cleaning up after me"". This felt like a huge slap in the face. I feel like she was basically saying that she would have quit her job earlier if she didn't have to spend time with me by doing so. I also feel resentful that she never spent any real time with me growing up, because she was always working at a job that she didn't even like.

I silently left the party and went up to my room to cry. Adola saw that I was upset as I was leaving, and followed me. She asked what was wrong, and I told her what my mom said and how I felt. She comforted me but also told me again that my parents love me and that I should be happy for my mom's success and ability to retire early. I guess after we talked she talked to my mom to let her know that I was upset. My mom came to my room after the party and told me that I was ungrateful and spoiled, and that I should be happy for her instead of thinking about myself.

AITA?

**Edit:** I just wanted to address some of the repetitive questions / comments here. Seems that for the most part I'm NTA. Thank you for all your judgements, even the not so nice ones. I want everybody to know I've read every comment and direct message, even if I didn't respond (sorry if I didn't, this has been pretty overwhelming).

1. *""Your parents don't really love you / cut them off as soon as possible""* \- I know people who said this meant well, but it hurts a lot to read. I still love my parents, I just wish I knew them better and spent more time with them.
2. *""If you want to mend the relationship, talk to them, lay it all out""* \- I think I might. I don't know when though. Maybe shortly before I leave for school, if I get a chance.
3. *""Go into therapy!""* \- I've been in therapy since I was 11, because of all the 'acting out' I mentioned above.
4. *""NTA get a job to become independent from them"" / ""YTA get a job to learn the value of money and hard work""* \- I have a job for this summer. I've held a summer job every year since I was 14. Sure it wasn't because I need money, yes it was for résumé purposes, yes sometimes it was abroad and more like a vacation - but still, I have worked. However, I would not be able to work enough hours at any position I could land during the school year to cover my tuition and living expenses at school.
5. *\*Insert any comment about my school situation\** \- I can't pay for it on my own and do the degree I want. I could minor in English for 2 years, but my parents want me to transfer into commerce (which I didn't get into for this year) so I need mostly econ-class pre-reqs to transfer, and once I'm in commerce I wouldn't be able to take English. I spoke with an academic advisor in May who told me about all the requirements to transfer. She basically told me I wouldn’t be able to do English along with commerce. Honestly at this point I might just take it easy with school and not try to meet the requirements for commerce. If I stay in Arts I can do a double major probably.
6. *""YTA, you're spoiled, you're probably the 1%, your parents are paying for your tuition, you have never wanted for anything""* \- I'll accept my judgment, but it seems all these comments are coming from a place of bias / jealousy rather than a thought-out judgment. I've only seen one YTA comment that really gives valid reasons for calling me an asshole.
7. *""you're not being abused so you have nothing to complain about. stop whining""* \- This isn't the Oppression Olympics. Complain-worthy content is different for everyone. Some people may unfortunately complain of violent and abusive parents. That's not my case, but it doesn't make my complaints any less valid or any less impactful in my own life.
8. *""Your parents clearly never wanted children""* \- The fact that I was planned (years in advance actually, they knew exactly when they wanted to conceive and have a kid) has come up in conversation in passing. Although I suspect some of you may be correct about them having a kid to check off a box / for the sake of appearances.
9. *""Keep in contact with Adola""* \- I certainly will! I can't imagine my life without her.

**Edit:** Also despite this info being in the original post, A LOT of people for some reason think I'm in the USA and that I'm Male. I'm a woman and in Canada."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I smoke weed to cope with that stress and because is one of the things that genuinely makes me smile but im very chill and responsable guy.

Before the story you'll need to know that my sister doesn't live in the house, she only comes in the weekends.

Today we were the three eating in the table and my sister asked my mom if she can use my room to study (high-school level study). The house has only two small rooms and a living room. I said no because I wanted to sleep so I can do stuff later, but told her that she could study in the confort of our living room. But then she started escalating the situation, she really wanted my room because she ""could"" study better there than in the living room.  Again I said no. It was hard to understand why my sister didn't seem to reason that the biggest difference between the two rooms is that one has a wooden table and the other a  ceramic one, eventually leading to her crying and shortly my mom told me screaming to get out of my room so she can study there, apparently our living room is not study-friendly enough to my sibling.

c3vcok	2019-06-22 22:02:11		AITA for not helping my best friend prepare for an interview?	"Long story long, my friend Katie and I have applied for the same on-campus job for this upcoming year with a limited number of spots. By luck of the draw, my interview was 3 days before hers (a day ago) and I'm pretty confident that I did well. So I get out of the interview and she texts me asking how it went. I say it went well, and I can tell she's nervous for her interview because she starts bombarding me with questions of what they asked me, how I responded, what questions I asked them, etc.. I could tell she wasn't asking me out of curiousity but instead trying to get information so her interview would go well.

I want her to do well, and ideally, I'd love for us to work this job together. Buuuuuut, at the moment we are competing for the same job, and I think it's only fair that we go into this interview with the same amount of information so I don't resent her for prying information out of me if she gets the job instead. I tell her this (much more delicately) and she gets really upset and says if we were really friends, then I would want what's best for her and for her to do well, hence why idk if I'm the asshole.

I didn't say this to her, but part of the reason I don't want to help her prepare is that I think she already has an edge over me. I think I have more experience relating to the department this job is in and somewhat better in interviews/interpersonally, however, she is more... racially and financially diverse than I am (for lack of a better term). This of course doesn't matter in our friendship and everyday life, however on the application they stated they may give students like her priority and she will be better able to speak on diversity than I can.

So basically, I feel like the playing field is pretty even without me giving her any information. If I do, I think I skew it in her favor and that will hurt me. Am I the asshole for this? Does this make me a bad friend?"		1	0
c3vbbs	2019-06-22 21:58:47	lemonbottles_89	AITA If I don't want to be the messenger for my divorced parents anymore.	My mom and dad have been divorced for about 8 years now. Among other reasons that they still have yet to share with my brother and I (I'm 19, he's 18), it was because my dad was very lazy, he'd leave my mom to do everything, would pressure her into making life decisions she didn't want, such as a career my dad thought would impress his family but one she didn't want, etc. We've lived with my mom since the divorce. my mother and father keep using me to communicate about things like house maintenance (my dad has moved out but the house is a duplex that's still in his name and half the bills are still sent to him. He rents the other side to other people as well), If my brother and I need money for something, they'll make me argue back and forth FOR THE TWO OF THEM about who's going to pay for it. They'll try to argue with me about what the other parent said, and when I'm unable to answer, they get frustrated at me, as if it's my fault. It's been going on for years, it's very stressful. The divorce has been hard on them and I know they're both still uncomfortable with talking, so I've always seen it as just this little thing I can do for the both of them to make things easier.

After living my whole life in a more central state in America where my only neighbors lived a few miles away. The place was left in pretty bad shape, especially the porch. So today I decided to try to clear out some of the dirt and polish up the concrete balcony (2nd floor) so I could have something like a porch to spend time. So I swept up all the dirt and got rid of all the old flower pots where all the mosquitoes were living and vacuumed up as much as I could but it still just looked like a parking lot slab of concrete. So I filled a bucket with soapy water and started scrubbing the balcony all over with a rag. I ended up going through about three buckets about two gallons each. I'm not used to being in a complex like this so before I realized it there was a bunch of water spilling over the side of my porch. There was a decent puddle down by the front of their porch and maybe some on it. I dont know if they have stuff down there I got wet, it rains a lot here so I figured not. They then came out and yelled at me asking if I was done. I immediately stopped and soaked up as much water as I could with bath towels and told them I was sorry. I left a note on their door with my name and unit number and told them to ask for me if they needed anything and that I was sorry. This might not seem like a big deal but I feel like shit and want to know what you all think. 

TLDR: I was cleaning my second floor porch. Got water on the neighbors under me porch. They yelled at me I tried to apologize. Do I suck?

I encouraged her to ask him out herself, but she got too nervous and asked if myself or my other friend (Cara - name changed) could do it.

I’m a pussy and refused to do it, but Cara said she’d do it and she did it.

I was getting changed for P.E when Sarah (not her real name) ran into the changing room looking very happy.

She said she had good news and I asked what had happened and she said that Cara had asked Trevor out for her and he said he’d think about it. I know, “I’ll think about it,” isn’t always a positive answer but we were excited. I, especially, was excited because not many people like Sarah and I was glad he might give her a chance.

Sarah & I go our separate ways, and when I get to the tennis court I ask Cara if she’d asked Trevor out for Sarah (I wanted to here what she’d said to him). 

Cara then proceeds to tell me that Trevor had said no and that she told Sarah that he said he’d think about it so she wouldn’t get depressed.

I was furious and told Cara that she should have gently told Sarah the truth. 

I don’t want to let Sarah know that Trevor actually said no, because I’d - like C - hate to see her upset. If I had asked him out, and he had said no, I’d have told her. But now that’s she super excited, I don’t want to tell her.

c3v6ec	2019-06-22 21:45:59	vulfreim	WIBTA if I cut off my friend from my Apple Music account without telling him?	"So I have an Apple Music subscription and have used it for years-- the three month trial convinced me and I am an avid Apple user. 

As a kindness, two years ago, I've decided to include my best friend onto my subscription and have set it up as a family plan by adding him to a ""family"" so he can get the benefits of Apple Music. This has, of course, upped the cost of the membership.

I didn't mind at first. I was more financially stable and didn't have student loans from university or credit cards or phone bills or whatever else to worry about. I have noticed that a $15 fee opposed to a $5 fee for the membership is starting to actually add up and has become less-than worth it. I'm fine with paying for the membership, but have considered cutting the plan down to be just me again, so I can continue to take advantage of a student plan.

I brought this up to my best friend. Initially I wanted to compromise by saying that I could pay for his plan provided he went with the student option. He kept dodging the subject and ignores me if I ever bring it up. And as someone who is approaching the whole being-broke-with-shitty-credit-score status, I find that I need to save that extra $10.

**Not once has he offered to chip in to the cost of the Apple Music membership, nor has he actually thanked me for it any time in the past few years.** He also always made more than me and has a lot more in his savings with less bills to worry about. Furthermore, the membership itself is used a lot more by me and he actually has opted to use Spotify instead, meaning I'm just pissing my money away on his behalf. 

Since he keeps ignoring the subject, doesn't seem grateful for my previous kindness, and doesn't even use it that much, I'm more or less deciding, with or without him, that I want to have my own plan to cut down on the cost.

c3v5p6	2019-06-22 21:44:21		AITA for flipping out on my sister?	"My \[22M\] middle sister \[24F\] and I have never quite seen eye to eye.

We used to get along great back when she was 17-18 and I was 15-16. She had moved into an apartment with her BF (now husband) of 4 months. They were my escape from home life for a while, and she was fairly care free and liberal in how she acted. Her and my brother in law were always cool about me being gay and for the first bit, very supportive of it.

We drifted apart when I went to college. I don't know why, to be honest. She moved out to the rural country area (Texas) and kind of became a raging bitch. She decided she wanted to be a hardcore conservative, anti-snowflake, homemaker woman. We've come to the conclusion, with the mediation of my grandmother, that politics and my ""personal choices"" just shouldn't be a topic of discussion, seeing as it always ended up heated. 

There's more to add about her behavior, if anyone wants info I can give it, but otherwise I'll stick with her reactions to my relationships.

She has been vehemently against any relationship I've had. The first one is fair, he was toxic but part of the reason I stayed with him is that my family offered little to no support or involvement.  This relationship ended about 2 years ago, though, and this past year I've been with an amazing and loving guy. My sister has been nothing but rude and critical. She's mad at me that he's older (he's 27), albeit her husband is 4 years older than her. She's mad at me that I'm ""Already in a relationship again"" (A year being single and finishing school isn't enough, I suppose?). She's mad that she thinks I moved solely for my bf (I started talking to him online AFTER I talked to my eldest sister about moving across country and staying with her/taking a job offer at her company). 

Anyhow - she called me yesterday for the first time in 4 months. We were chitchatting - she asked when I'd be visiting them, because her visiting us is out of the question for some reason, I casually mentioned I was likely moving in with my BF in a few months, and may be tight on PTO at whatever place I work, and if I do visit I'd like to bring him with. She berated me again about how dare I move in with him so soon (over a year? really?) and that I know our grandparents and her would be ""put off"" by me bringing my boyfriend, and I fucking came unglued on her, making it very apparent that if I ever did visit he'd be coming with me and they could either act like adults and treat him like my partner or fuck off and not see me at all, and that she had no right to be a hypocritical bitch and tell me not to do things that she did 10 times faster. 

My oldest sister and dad admit she can be a bitch, but think ""she just has my best interest in mind"". I have to disagree, it seems like she just gets a rise out of telling me what to do and thinking she's so goddamn sagely with me because she was on this earth for an extra year and three months.

c3v5cb	2019-06-22 21:43:33	TTP1832	AITA for making a girl cry due to me explaining how her legal situation would likely pan out	"I was talking to one of my friends (18) and she was telling me how she got a ticket for underage possession of alcohol. Basically, she doesn't drink but her and her friends were going to a concert and she offered to DD and they transported alcohol in her car. Then when they were tailgating the concert a cop came up and busted her tailgate. Everyone who was drinking had cups so the cop didn't go after them, however he did see the alcohol in my friends trunk so she ended up getting a citation.

&#x200B;

She was really upset about this since she doesn't drink and told me she was challenging the citation because she thought she did nothing wrong and was being punished unfairly. I told her that I empathized with her situation but if I were her I would not expect that she would be able to get the citation dropped, because in the eyes of the law, transportation/possession was just as illegal as consuming alcohol when underage (at least in my state). Full disclosure I'm not a lawyer but i have a good amount of experience with this kind of situation so I felt justified in telling her what I knew

&#x200B;

I was truly just trying to be helpful because i felt like she had unrealistic expectations of how this whole situation was going to turn out, and I thought she was way too confident in her case. She kept denying it and I kept trying to explain it and she got upset and started crying. In hindsight I realize that I shouldn't have kept going once I saw that she was getting upset but in the heat of the argument I guess I just lost track of her emotions. I feel really bad about the situation and have apologized since. Were cool now but shes asked me not to talk about it anymore. Thoughts?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c3v3lq	2019-06-22 21:38:47	Titan_Uranus__	WIBTA for giving plants as gifts?	"So I think this will be a lot lighter compared to a lot of AITAs here but I'm kinda weird socially sometimes so I would love some input.

I'm a weird plant person now with very few friends since moving to a new state about a year ago. I'm fine with it, I have dogs and a fellow socially awkward bf but I've made a few connections to some very kind people here so far. 

Today, I went to an intern at my work's graduation and all of us coworkers signed a card for her, the bosses threw some cash into the card, and I bought her a jade plant because I think they're beautiful and I read that recieving one as a gift means good luck, prosperity, and friendship. I figured that was great for a graduation gift. I also repot it using the proper soil and gave it some fertilizer so she won't have to do anything for it besides add water and sun for quite some time.

I'm also not a big fan of giving bouquets as gifts because they just die and while some flowers dry well enough to keep, most you just throw away. 

She was happy that we came to her graduation and to get another(I gave her another one for her birthday because I adore this girl) plant from me but when I got to the car, I started to worry.

Is it rude to give a gift of a house plant to someone? I know it's not as presumptuous as say giving a dog as gift, but plants still require some care. I also would never give anyone orchids or African violets because they're more needy than say a pothos.

I'm mostly asking because a few years ago, my uncle gave us his senior dog because he was moving out of the country and we took care of her and loved her until we had to put her down about 8 weeks ago. Before we took her in, I painted her paws to make prints on some pots that I painted a little for decoration, then sealed because terracotta is finicky. Since he and his family are back in the country and I'll be seeing them at a family reunion, I wanted to fill some of the pots with very low maintenance plants for them to keep as a tribute to her. I'm thinking ZZs or pothos because they're (in my experience) very easy to take care of and super rewarding to watch grow. But they're also fine with lower light and water when you remember. 

I don't want to give someone a burden as a gift. Just because I want to turn my house into a jungle doesn't mean everyone does. I'm not so sure why I started to stress about this today, but I did almost immediately after giving my friend the plant at her graduation and started to rethink this whole dog-memorial-plant gift to my uncle's family. I haven't potted anything for them, but I've been propagating a few plants that I'd like to give them.

Anyway, thanks for the help, I'm again kinda oblivious to most social cues or interactions that aren't limited to work stuff or on horrible reality tv."	No A-holes here	0	0

I stayed in the apartment we lived in here, partially because they didn't want to sell it (in case they got back) and partly because I didn't have anywhere to go. Now I live here with my boyfriend  and my cat (with their permission).

So, they're coming to visit, and when speaking to my mom I jokingly said that I'm gonna have to ""lick the place clean"" since she has such high cleaning standards. She took it seriously so I decided to warn her that the cat did a bit of damage to the wallpaper on a certain wall, and that I was going to fix it.

She asked when will I renovate, to which I said that even though it bothers me a lot, it's not my top priority right now because I have things bothering me more with the apartment. I didn't have the chance to give examples, since I got flooded with demands to renovate it immediately since ""it doesn't take much, just pay someone to do it, and the apartment hasn't been renovated in 4 years!"". I tried to explain that I cannot prioritize it now and she demanded I do since if I don't the ""god knows when I get to that"". She then offered to charge rent (I only pay the bills) and take care of it herself. I said okay, I'd rather her to take care of it. Then she got back to ""why don't you do it"".

I said that I'd rather pay her to do it her way and leave me alone. I then added that I can rent some other place and she could do whatever she wanted with this apartment. She changed the subject to ""do you actually think you'll have less trouble renting another place"" - I said that I'd rather fight over such things with people I don't care for rather than my own family. So now she's yelling at me, so I raise my voice - ""WHATEVER, I'LL DO IT AS SOON AS YOU FLY BACK"". So she tells me to calm down and hangs up.

I still think that she's asking for too much - aside from the few wallpaper tears the apartment is in perfect condition (mainly because I kept it that way taking care of shitty results from past renovations), she doesn't intend on selling or renting it out, and she sees it once every 2 years for a week or two. Besides, even though it's ""no big deal"" for her (and I can save up to pay for this), it'll still cost triple the average monthly salary, will take at least a few of weeks to finish (during which I have to live with the dust and shield my pet from all of this), and won't really fix practical problems (like minor kitchen leaks, the lack of a proper closet etc.). As I said, I do plan on getting to it, just not in the next year or so.

On the other hand, I feel like an asshole because I indeed paid no rent while living here (I didn't get my college money because they moved, but I managed so I'm only mentioning it because I'm petty rn), and I feel spoiled since I don't have to deal with a landlord 99% of the time.

TL;DR - mom expects me to renovate her (and dad's) apartment ASAP because I live here and it hasn't been renovated in 4 years."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3uybj	2019-06-22 21:24:35	leo_stinky_cat	AITA for not inviting my friends GF to my wedding?	"Obligatory first time posting and on mobile so please make allowances for me. 

Backstory; My mum’s best friend’s oldest son is the same age as me (21F), and her youngest son is the same age as my sister (18F), and as a result we are all very close. Oldest Son (OS) has been with his partner for five years, they are engaged and live together. Youngest Son (YS) has been seeing his girlfriend for just under 2 years. They have broken up once before. 

I am getting married in five months. We are mostly paying for the wedding ourselves (with help from family here and there instead if gifts). We have a maximum of 100 guests, and both of us have really big families. As a result of this, a lot of people haven’t made the cut unfortunately. YS’s gf is one of these people. 
My mother has just found this out, and is not happy. She says her friend is very very hurt, as OS’s fiancée is invited but YS’s gf is not. To me, this isn’t the same thing. OS has been with his partner for years, and they are getting married next year. That isn’t the same as dating. No one is getting a plus one unless they are engaged to their partner or living together (which is a total of about three people), and I think this is fair. The only exception to this is my sister’s bf, who she has not been with long, but she is my sister and I feel that it’s different. 

But here’s my main problem. I HATE YS’s gf. She’s rude, cheeky, ignorant, impolite, and just generally puts me on edge any time I am around her. She is the same age as my sister, and when they are together they are thick as thieves, but when they’re not together, even my sister does not like her. She talks about me behind my back, and laughs at me when i try to talk to my sister. She talks about the way I look in a very unsubtle way, and I do not like being around her. I do not want this stress on my wedding day, and I don’t want to sacrifice someone I do like’s place at my wedding to invite her. 

I understand that they have been together for some time and she is relatively close to his family and is usually around my family too when he is there. 

AITA for not inviting her if I invite OS’s fiancée?

tldr; i’m not inviting my friends gf who i do not like, but i’m inviting his brothers partner."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3uy7r	2019-06-22 21:24:15	ShatMyselfOnTheBus	AITA for leaving my GF in a city	"Am I The Asshole for leaving my girlfriend in the local city because she went back for her coat?

Backstory, we had been in our local big city about forty minutes away. We went for her friends birthday, it was an all day rave, I made it clear I didn't want to go. I ended up going, and having a decent time with her friends, but, we mutually agreed to leave early, it's time to go home.
 We get an overpriced taxi of about £20 to the bus station from the venue, where we have to get an hour and a half bus home. This is where she realises she has forgotten her jacket, ok, fair enough we need to get her jacket seeing as it's 30-40mins away, but she calls her friend who agrees to pick up her jacket on the way out of the rave. As the bus turns up she decides to go book a taxi back to the club and pick up her jacket herself. I in the meantime get on the bus home.
I haven't mentioned that I have recently moved in with her parents, and that she has intact told her sister, which will get back to her parents, her side of the story.

I always tell my parents that he is not saving anything from the money he gets and he spends every thing in his wallet in one day no matter how much they give him , they always reply with he is young and stupid and they can't cut his allowance because he may do something illegal.

I see my brother like 2 h a day and those two hours are hell , he doesn't speak with our parents until he is short on cash and when i point this out to him he gets angry and argus with me and when i argue back my parents defend him always.

it all started when she stoped showing up to school because she had some drama with her bestfriend (boyfriend drama) and decided that everyone hates her and she doesn't have any reason to show up to school.

so she skiped school for about two months at that time-now im not going to lie i was upset with her as well since her best friend is a good friend of mine and what she did to her was ugly- so i didnt text her at first but after a while i got worried and talked to her at school when she finally showed up. 

she told me about the fight that she had with her best friend and what happened with her boyfriend (i still thoughted what she did was wrong so i tried not to talk about it) and also told me she have alot of trouble at home and so on.

so i told her that im willing to go to her house every morning to help her out so that she'll make it to school (since her parents didn't) and she kept saying that she will be fine but insisted that It'll help her but she kept saying no so i dropped it and we didn't talked that much since then, i slept over and went out with her but we never talked about it.

now fast forward in time its now two days after graduation- she never showed up to school ever since not even to finals (now that's fine to me but it doesn't seem like she has something else planned for her) she's still with the guy that got her into so much trouble and she stopped talking with all of her high school friends including me...

i feel like a asshole for ignoring her and not reaching out but at the same time im glad i didnt because i know that if i did i would be at the same position as she is. i know it sounds bad but i preferred to focus on school in the past year.

i just can't shake off the feeling that i could have help her out while studying...

side note: she ignored me at our graduation party  and she was right next to me... i feel like shit"	TL;DR	0	0

c3uwq7	2019-06-22 21:19:57	smavidsdridal	AITA for asking my manager to take a walk in customer so I could get a break?	"Hi. I work at a bridal store that works on fixed appointments. Our breaks are scheduled around those appointments. Today I have an 8 hour shift, so according to company policy I'm supposed to get one half hour break. We had a walk in bride come who's wedding was in 2021 and she straight up said she wasn't going to buy, she just wanted to try dresses on. That's fine, however we do work on commission and it's kinda sucky when that happens. 



At this time, I was finishing up with my bride who's appointment ended at 4:30, and I was supposed to go on break after this. There's also one other stylist here who was just about to get off break who could have taken her once she came back from break. My manager asked me to skip my break and take this walk in, and I asked why the other stylist wouldn't be able to when she got back, because I wouldn't be able to take my break if I took her. My manager got visibly irritated at me for this, and said she'd just take her herself. 

I'm on break now but feel guilty for not taking the bride. I also dont understand why the other stylist didn't just take over once she got off break. I feel like I should have just taken her to avoid conflict, and now I have to close with a manger who's mad at me lol. AITA?

They had a party for her kid (her and her ex’s kid) this time last year and we had someone close to us pass away a month before and they had a memorial for her the same day as the party (out of town family planned it, so it was a month later.) When we told them we were coming to the party but would be really late, my brother in law questioned my husband why we would be late. He told him we had a memorial. BIL then proceeded to ask him who it was and to see the obit. So my husband sent it. Since the dates were a month apart, my BIL laughed and said, good try, she died a month ago, what’s your real excuse!?
Every since then, I have been bitter about this. I’ve let it go, but haven’t forgotten. Afterwards, they missed a couple of our kids birthday parties, mentioning they would bring something to them (not that that matters), but never followed through.
Well, they just had a party for her son (same one from her ex) today, and I told my husband to make the decision if we go or not. So, he told his brother traffic was bad and we weren’t going. I just can’t help feel bad for the kid b/c it’s not his fault, but I don’t feel like even trying because they don’t try for us.
Are we the a**holes for not going?

c3usu2	2019-06-22 21:09:31		AITA for holding a grudge and wanting to cut my friends out?	I graduated college a little bit ago and something hasn’t stopped bothering me since. I started rooming with these 2 best friends my third year of school. I was worried about being a third wheel but we actually all got along great! We became super close and would often hang out together. I am pretty introverted and enjoy my alone time so I would sometimes do things on my own (like going somewhere or staying in my room). However by our fourth year, one of the best friends (roommate#1) became close with 2 other girls and roommate#2 forced her way into their friendship too. They became a group of four that I always struggled to fit in with. I would hang out with them every so often but I always felt uncomfortable and like I didn’t belong. bunch of guys that they occasionally hung out with). However, I still had a pretty good relationship with my two roommates when we were hanging out without the two new girls. For our final spring break they took a trip (the four of them, plus one more girl, and a bunch of other guys they occasionally hung out with). I was not invited on the trip and it really hurt my feelings. When I found out they were going on the trip (through social media)  I asked roommate#1 if I was invited and she told me there was no room for me. When I expressed that I was upset about that to roommate#2 she told me she hadn’t really known about the trip and kinda pushed herself onto it. Then, I found out (again through social media) that roommate#2 had actually known about the trip 4 months prior to spring break. I was devastated that she lied to me and that I wasn’t fitting in. I felt like I had no friends and no one to turn to. Then, what felt to me like rubbing it in, they sent me snapchats from the beach where everyone was enjoying the trip. They captioned them, “we miss you!” Once they got back from spring break, I tried to distance myself because I knew we would be graduating and going our separate ways in a few months. They just messaged me and asked if they could stay with me for a weekend to see a concert. However, I really want to reply “there’s no room for you.” I’m obviously still holding a grudge and don’t want to continue to communicate with them. They were my best friends for a couple years and we had always talked about being bridesmaids at each other’s future weddings. Now I never want to see them again. AITA?		1	0

So today, I was sitting on the couch playing games on my computer, before I had to leave for work in a couple hours. My younger brother by a few years was still asleep, even though it was already 2:30 in the afternoon. I hear one of my cats enter the room to use the litter-box, when about 5 minutes later the smell hits.  


My cats are stinky little buggers, but by god this was terrible. I lookup to see my tabby desperately wiping his legs against the floor, dragging a cord around. I naively thought he was playing. I was so wrong. I get up to take the cord away, the smell worsening with every step, and that's when I see the shit smeared all over the floor, carpet, cat beds, etc. My heart sank as I saw that my poor little man must've had the runs, and it spread all over his back legs and feet. I scooped him up, tears watering from the stench, and brought him to the sink. I did my best to wash him, but between the water and my string of expletives, he was not a happy camper. This is when I realized I needed another set of hands. I shouted across the house multiple times, desperation growing as my cat escaped multiple times, spreading the trail of shit that I would no doubt have to clean up. Finally, after no reply, I sat the cat down where I hoped he would sit still, then rushed to my brother's room.   


I shook him awake, and hurriedly explained what was going on. His job was to hold our cat down so I could wipe the shit off of him. The entire time I did this he was screaming at me, name calling and cursing my name until I got the cat clean enough to let him go. He continued to lay into me, not because of the catshit but because I'd woken him up.   


I understand he was up late last night on his computer, and he didn't go to bed until the sun was up but I definitely couldn't wash that cat by myself, and waiting for him to wake up on his own was not an option.

I generally like dogs, but I do know a number of people that are allergic to dogs, afraid of dogs, etc.  My feeling is that people taking dogs where they shouldn't are abusing the general non-confrontational behavior of people, staff, etc, while stepping on rules.  

I see a couple in line at a food court restaurant in the mall. It's something the size of a German Shepherd, and on a leash. I say to the guy holding the leash, ""Dogs aren't allowed in the food court.""

He looks at me and just nods. 

So I say, ""That is a dog. This is a food court. Your dog is in it.""

He just nods, smiles, gives a ""yep."". The woman he was with says to me, ""You need to step back.""

So, I leave. 

My issue -- the mall is apparently dog friendly. Indoor food establishments in California don't allow dogs, but there doesn't appear to be a sign. 

So, am I the asshole?


Edit:

So, good news!

Thanks to everyone saying I shouldn't try to enforce the law, and instead find someone in authority, I found out that I could get a reward of up to $100 for reporting just this one incident.  And if they find it's a common occurrence, I could end up with $5k!

If that happens, r/RandomActsOfPiizza will have a very good day.


Edit:

For the record, I did get a note back from the department of health:

""I am at the mall conducting inspections at least once a week and have noticed the same issue. The only dogs allowed in the food court and dining area/terrace are service animals. Per ADA service animal law, no identification or vest is required to indicate proof of a service animal. The only legal questions may be asked:

Is that dog a service animal?
If so, what services does the animal provide?
Emotional support is not considered an approved service for service animals. I have included some handouts on service animals. Unfortunately, when I ask the above questions, majority of the time the public states the dog is a service animal and gets very upset when I try to ask the second question. I simply provide the information to those I see with dogs and let them know only service animals are allowed and no pets. There are signs posted throughout the facility, however I have told mall management to provide bigger signs or have security monitor the food court more. Anytime I see an animal and it has been confirmed that the dog is not a service animal, I report it to mall management to have security handle the manner. If you would like to put in a formal complaint, I will be happy to take care of the complaint and sit down with mall management.

I'm only adding this update to answer the people who were saying, ""Oh, dogs are probably allowed."""	Asshole	0	0

c3ukwh	2019-06-22 20:48:33	cynicalspit	AITA for ruining my brothers best friends life?	"So, for some backstory, I’ve known this guy (We’ll call him S) for years. He was my brothers BEST friend, and he practically lived with us. He went on vacations with us, was always sleeping over, etc. Point being, he was basically family to us. Another point to note is that I am a crippling nicotine addict, and at the time that this happened, I had no access to any kind of nicotine and S was letting me borrow one of his two vapes. This will be important later on.

S and my boyfriend had been getting pretty close as friends, since they work in the same place together. Him and my BF decided to play a game of Never Have I Ever (the card game, its similar to Cards Against Humanity) since S had never played the game. S had placed down a card that said “Been a peeping tom”, which BF had found amusing and asked what the story behind it was.

S had admitted that he’d been creeping on me when I was getting undressed, changed, and showering for the past 5 years, roughly (For context, I was a minor at the time of him peeping on me, he was not). Needless to say, my BF was PISSED. I felt violated, and hurt that he would do that — but I had no proof, so I couldn’t do anything about it.

Maybe three days after that, BF, S and I were playing the card game again. BF had went to bed around 4AM, and it was just S and I. He and I tried to play the game, but he admitted that “It was boring with only two players”. I agreed, and said that I was going to go to bed, and when I got up, he told me to sit back down. I did. Big mistake. 

He pulled the vape that he’d been letting me use from his pocket and said that he’d be “willing to give me one for free”. I was intrigued, but I asked him what the catch was, because I knew there would be one. He asked me to see a private area of mine. Obviously, I declined, and said that I would never cheat on my boyfriend, and it was creepy of him to suggest that. He shrugged and essentially said “Okay, just don’t tell anyone”. I felt violated, disgusted, and immediately went to bed. My boyfriend could tell that something wasn’t right, and I told him everything that happened. 

Long story short, my BF told their mutual friends and they dropped him immediately. BF also told their co-workers what happened, and S was put on blast in front of the entire restaurant. I told my therapist what happened and CPS was contacted (S lives in a house with five sisters, three of which are younger than he is), alongside the police.

I feel terrible. My family, disregarding my brother and BF, are pissed off at me for deciding to open my mouth and tell my therapist. They don’t think he deserves what he’s getting, and my family is practically shunning me for telling people about what he did. 

So, AITA for ruining S’s family dynamic, job, and social life for creeping on me for five years and asking me to cheat on my boyfriend?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3ukn7	2019-06-22 20:47:48		AITA for snapping at my mother for constantly ignoring/not listening fully when I talk to her?	"Hey, so this is my first post and this has been bugging me for a really long time. 

&#x200B;

(I'm from the UK)

I live at home with my parents, have been since I finished school (at 16) three years ago. I don't usually get in to full conversations with my parents but when I do I find myself having to repeat full sentences. It's really upsetting for me and I do get mad about it, personally I just don't understand how you can ignore someone who's talking directly to you. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, the other day I was talking to my mom. She didn't listen to me properly and cut me off. The conversation went a bit like this.

&#x200B;

Mom: Do you have any rubbish for the bin?  (I hadn't long finished cooking dinner for myself)

Me: No, I've thrown all my rubbish- 

(She cuts me off)

Mom: What about the tuna can? (I had tuna for lunch and I didn't throw it away. I admitted that but she had thrown it away hours ago)

Me: \*getting upset about being cut off\* You didn't let me finish, I was going to say I threw all my rubbish away that I've used tonight. (Sometimes when I cook I do end up leaving wrappers and things out until the next day)

&#x200B;

We ended up having a bit of an argument and I am an emotional person so I was pretty teared up the entire time I was trying to explain to her where she went wrong. 

&#x200B;

Basically I did most of the talking and I honestly don't think she was listening to most of it. I was explaining that she cut me off and all of this could've been avoided if she would just listen to me. 

&#x200B;

I do know that it was a stupid argument but it is the one that's really got me thinking. AITA for snapping at my mother after all this time of just keeping it in?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

You don't need to introduce your child as 28 months old to people. They are 2 years old, plain and simple. Now if it's talking to the doctor, that is more understandable due to child development and all. But I will correct people by saying ""Oh so they are 2?"". I honestly do not think I can help it. I've even had people dead serious about saying their 36 month old. What compels people to do this??

EDIT: I should mention I'm a father of three and work in EMS. I know the importance of the age in month's when it comes to medical things. I just don't get why you have to tell a random stranger your child is 19 months old."	Asshole	0	0

I finished and started bringing the dishes to the table, he complained again saying something like:  ""Get the fuck out, you are in the way"" i got mad and said to him he shouldn't be saying anything because at least i was doing something instead of watching TV. After that i went to the kitchen and my mom asked me why we were fighting, i told her what happened and she said that i shouldn't have said anything and that we shouldn't fight when there are visits.

Towards the end of the semester, my roommate George told me that he had been staying away from the group because he was trying to get a girlfriend. This didn’t make any sense to me. George said apparentlyevery girl who meets me is attracted to me and nobody else in the group gets a chance. George has expressed on several occasions this same thing, that all the girls we meet or I meet are always attracted to me and nobody else in the group. Apparently, Matt had such an issue with this that he decided he couldn’t be around me at all since he wanted to get a girlfriend. I was hanging out with one of the girls that I’m friends with and that he had once tried to go for and I brought this up because it had really been bothering me. I didn’t do this intentionally to spite Matt, I just needed someone to talk to about it and we have been good friends for a while. She ended up bringing it up to Matt. Matt hasn’t spoken to me since and George is pissed at me for talking about it. Did I fuck up here?"		1	0

It was time to make the three hour drive home and I had started it before realizing that I needed to charge my phone so i could use the GPS. I stopped at the only bar available before the highway, a Hooters. I know it's going to take a while for my phone to charge so I settle in at the bar and order a beer. Start chatting with the bartender and the fellas sitting next to me. The bartender, a 20 something blonde, starts laughing that the guy who had just paid and left the bar had left a really shitty tip (which in my opinion wasnt THAT shitty.... 4 dollars on a 30 dollar bill) but had also left his phone number at the bar. 

I'm a pretty social person. And I told her and the guys sitting with me that it would be so funny if I texted him from my phone pretending to be her. She  laughs and agrees and gives me the number. I start by sending him something fairly innocuous like ""hey cutie"" and then I'm sharing his responses with everyone and everyone's laughing. I keep getting a more and more sexually explicit as time goes on and he starts getting VERY explicit. He is into some stuff that I wont kink shame him for but it is making everyone die laughing. I forget my plans to get home and decide that I'll have a few more and stay in town another night. 

The bartender tells me to ask him for a picture and I do (stating clearly to him that I dont want a nude). He sends me a selfie and he is a young not unattractive guy who is only in town for a few nights as well. He asks for a picture of her and she takes my phone takes a selfie and sends it to her. The night at the bar ends with him still texting me flirty stuff that I'm starting to ignore, but as I head to my hotel he asks me if ""I"" want to come over. I wanted to see how far I could push it and I was pretty drunk at this point. He was drunk too apparently. I asked him how much it was worth to him and he asked how much ""I"" was worth for a night. I said 400. He said he would pay 200 upfront and the rest after. 

I am telling myself now that I've sobered up that I really just wanted to see if he would do it and I gave him my Venmo. He sent me $200. I panicked not knowing why I felt scared and deleted his number, made my account private, and fell asleep. I woke up with a hangover in the morning and went looking for a way to give the money back but had deleted all info from the evening before. 

AITA?

Tldr: young drunk guy at Hooters gets scammed by me and I'm wondering if I'm an asshole."		1	0

So while looking for a spot, someone, we'll call him Charlie, was driving around also looking for a spot but randomly stopping allowing other cars to around him. Well I decided to go around him and a spot happened to have opened up so naturally I took it. Little did I know, Charlie was waiting for the spot. After taking the spot, Charlie blares on his horn and proceeds to get out of his car and starts swearing at me. 

I proceeded to apologize and said sorry I feel bad but I'm not moving. Charlie had a wife and young kid in his car and I felt bad that they had to witness his meltdown. I really did accidentally take his spot, but I intentionally didn't move due to his reaction. Charlie then screamed about how he was going to call the cops and I told him I don't think they'd care much. Fortunately, the spot next to me opened up and Charlie took that one.

AITA for accidentally stealing Charlie's spot and then not moving after he was being a dick in front of his family?

Edit:

Charlie if you happen to stumble upon this, sorry, I was being an asshole and I should've just moved. But you probably shouldn't have been swearing like that in front of your kid.

c3ud46	2019-06-22 20:27:45	jadexoi	AITA for giving my boyfriends 14 year old cousin condoms and telling her she doesn’t have to wait until marriage?	"Ok so I’ve been with my boyfriend about 2 years now and I’ve met his cousin quite a few times. She’s really sweet and always talks to me a lot when I see her. When I saw her a while ago she started talking about a purity ring at one point and saying that she wouldn’t have sex until marriage, I changed the subject quite quickly because I didn’t really know how to respond. 

It was on my mind a lot after we left though. I know her family are very conservative and religious  and I obviously support whatever she wants to do but I wondered if she needed some other advice from someone who wasn’t her family. I said to my boyfriend shall we give her some condoms and say she should obviosuly wait cause she’s too young atm but she doesn’t have to wait until marriage? He was like nah, I’d just stay out of it. Tbh, I didn’t listen to him because I feel like she did need advice, so when I saw her recently I pulled her into another room with me and gave them to her and said to her ‘look you’re too young to have sex atm but I don’t know what you’ve been taught by your school or your family but I just want you to have these in case you do ever need them’ I said, ‘it is ok to have sex before marriage, it doesn’t make you dirty or impure. You should definitely wait until you find someone who respects you, but I just wanted to tell you this.’ And I gave her my number and told her if she needs to talk about anything I’m always willing to listen and won’t judge her. 

I told her to go get her bag and put them in there so she did, and that was that. 

Well, we get a knock on our door yesterday from her parents going mad at me for giving her underaged child condoms and telling her to have sex. I was like...woahhhhh I did not tell her to have sex, I wanted her to have them in case anything happens. They were like she’s a child why are you trying to persuade her into doing stuff. I was like this is ridiculous. My boyfriend told them to leave but he apologized to them which made me mad, but they were like I don’t want her near our child.

c3ucmb	2019-06-22 20:26:20	ringaroundtheoffice	AITA for taking off my engagement ring at the office?	"I'm M31, newly engaged to my partner M34 of nearly a decade. Our country doesn't legally recognize same-sex marriage yet, but we wish to make a commitment in the form of civil partnership sometime soon. Engagement would be a symbolic step towards that.

My partner works at a local museum and he's out to his co-workers and boss. However, I'm employed at a government agency, where the work environment is largely conservative. While it's illegal for anyone as an employer to discriminate on the grounds of gender/ sexual orientation, I find it wiser to play on the safe side and only confide in a limited number of co-workers I trust. After all, you can get fired under any pretense.

Therefore I've been taking off my engagement ring at work to avoid dealing with invasive questions from gossipy co-workers. My partner is aware of this, as well as my general workplace atmosphere, and although he doesn't take his ring off for work, he understands my decision. After all, my job makes up for more than half of our income, which we can't afford to lose.

With that said, it's not like I haven't felt conflicted. Mainly because I somewhat see the action of taking off the ring as a betrayal of our relationship. My sister has also reprimanded me for the decision, saying that it wasn't fair to my partner and that I should opt to wear the ring on a different finger or a chain. But seeing as I'm not the type of the guy to wear accessories, I'm afraid my co-workers would get suspicious about this new jewelry on me.

Anyhow. What's your judgment AITA-wise?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c3ubsr	2019-06-22 20:24:05		AITA: I’m a woman that immobilised a young male thief but feel surprisingly guilty	"AITA: I [37F] have been struggling with an issue for a few months. I work as a clinical supervisor for an occupational health team that helps low income young adults receive additional tutoring, support and help with job applications. I live in a small town and 2 years ago there was a series of bicycle thefts in the area. It unsettled a lot of women given the thief was targeting female bikes and any cyclist knows they are not cheap pieces of kit. Fast forward a few weeks and returning back from a ride with a group of ladies, the plan was to stop and have lunch with a view. We rested the bikes 15m and one of the ladies saw a kid in his late teens come out of nowhere and take off with my friends bike. Im not a confrontational person but in that moment I felt so much anger so I ran, jumped on my bike and raced after him. He knew I was catching him so ditched the bike and started running. I caught up to him and realised I have no idea how to fight.l but I had a few pounds on him (pear shape checking in here!). I tackled him to the floor and trapped his head between my legs. Looking back I shudder as it could have been reckless but I felt confident I had him secured. His initial reaction was to try and struggle and shout abuse. Having worked with young people this is a normal reaction to understanding the negative consequences to come. My friends caught up and called the police. Fortunately there was a squad car 5 minutes away. I tried to calm him down and assured him I wasn’t going to hurt him. When he realised he wasn’t going to escape he started crying and telling me how tough his life was and he was only doing this for money to live and survive. At this point I felt really conflicted. My job is to help these young people get on in life and here I was restraining and capturing a young kid from a bad family. I then thought about the nature of his offences. He had stole over 50 bikes, caused so much distress and purposely prayed on a gender he thought was weak. I know women who didn’t have $2k bikes insured and were distraught. His crying was still making me feel terrible so I told him I would at least loosen my grip slightly if he calmed down. He then tried to yank out and escape so I had to squeeze again. The police eventually came and verified that he was the person matching all the reports and thanked me sincerely. He had also been for inappropriate behaviour. He his serving time and I just feel guilty given my job and principles of giving everyone a second a chance. 

I feel guilty that I may have set a young person back and then on the other I am a feminist so feel empowered that I was able to physically overpower someone who thought I was a weak person to target. Do you think capturing him and turning him in was the right thing to do or do you think if I had spoke to him, told him his actions needed to change and then released him it would have been sufficient?"		1	0

She kept calling it ""destructive criticism"" instead of ""constructive"" and then says a reasonable thing which is ""you shouldn't give criticism if it isn't asked for"". Which is true. But but, she's never minded it before when I've pointed out something, and I felt like it was just a thing I could mention.

c3u5xi	2019-06-22 20:08:41	edwadokun	AITA for not wanting to take her to my brother's wedding?	"This story is from a few years ago.

I met this girl on okcupid. We chat a bit and she want to meet up as quickly as possible. I thought it was a bit forward but I personally prefer getting to know each other in person anyways over the text.

On our first date, we had slept together. I have never moved this fast with a girl before as I am pretty shy, but she initiated and my mind upstairs was no longer driving but my mind downstairs was in full control.

In hindsight, I shouldn't have slept with her on the first date, but I am only human and I was a mid-20s male who bloomed very late so my hormones took over. Not saying this is ok but hey, as a guy, when a cute girl says she wants the D that quickly, it's like a damn dream come true.

The 2nd time I see her, I tell her how I've been busy planning my older brother's bachelor party as he was getting married in 3 months. She starts asking me a ton of questions about the wedding and then starts looking up dresses on her phone. Immediately, a red flag pops up and I'm thinking, you are not coming to this wedding. From my point of view, this isn't just any wedding, it is my brother's wedding. Which means my entire family will be there and this girl wants to be my date even only knowing each other for less than a month and she wasn't even my girlfriend. Even if I had a gf at the time, the only way I'd bring someone would be if we had been together for over a year and she has met at least my immediate family.

I start trying to change her mind like but it’s not quite working. She says how she's so excited to meet my family, while I'm just freaking out. I eventually change the subject.

After that moment, I am pretty freaked out by her. Over the next few days, she starts asking me more and more about the wedding. I tell her it's too late to add any more people to the list and that the venue is already at capacity. She insists that I tell my brother she is going and won't be in the way. After going back and forth for a bit, she finally stops pushing the wedding and realizes she can't go.

At this point, I am no longer into her at all. her attitude towards my brother's wedding seemed really out of line to me. A few days later, I decide to end things with her and she FLIPS out on me. I tell her that I don't see us working out in the long run and just call it quits here. She starts to berate me with insults, calling me names, saying how she faked orgasmed and all these shenanigans. This is where nice me goes away and I tell her off that her immaturity is a clear sign. I go on to say that the fact that she doesn't understand why it was inappropriate for her to invite herself to my brother's wedding was the main driving factor. I blocked and never talked to her again.

So, my question is AITA? Did I lead her on? Remind you, I never initiated the physical intimacy. She did and I don't know if she took that as a sign that we were ""together""."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3u50d	2019-06-22 20:06:19		AITA for getting angry that my wife gave away her inheritance worth USD 6.2 million?	"My wife and I have been together for the last ten years and married for the last 4.

We met while studying at university so we really didn't know much of each other's backgrounds.
I come from a poor family and have experienced a lot of poverty during my teenage years. I have always been open about this to my wife along with my desire to try and save enough money so that our children never have to experience what I went through while they grow up.

Post graduation my wife gave up a lot of good job offers in order to pursue a further degree. During this time I worked very hard to be able to put a down payment on an apartment, furnish the entire place and buy us a second hand car. I also footed all bills/petrol when we went out. I understood my wife wasn't working and I had absolutely no problem doing any of the above at the time.

Unknown to me at that point of time was that my wife's family were rich landowners. This is something she never shared with me. When her father died about 6 years ago my wife and her two brothers inherited the entire estate as their mother had died when they were younger. After receiving some bad advice from a family friend my wife and her brothers decided that holding on to the land would be too much trouble so they just  signed it over to a charity run by the family friend for free.

My wife only shared this with me once we were married. The whole episode angered me for two reasons. 1) my wife and I were already dating for 6 years when this happened and I feel she should have atleast told me about the land and all that was happening 2) given my background and my motivation to escape poverty I felt this money could have helped us out. 

Currently my wife is a stay at home who looks after our two small children. We live paycheck to paycheck on my salary. We don't have much savings and sometimes things do get hard trying to live on a budget.

I feel we could have put the land to use for farming ( which is what it is currently being used for) and earned some good income. Currently my wife's brothers are also not doing well financially. So am I the asshole for feeling angry/bitter to my wife for doing this?"	No A-holes here	1	0

c3u43m	2019-06-22 20:03:41		WIBTA if I stay at home to avoid going on a school bus	"I'm(15F)  new so I apologise if I get anything wrong.

When going to and from school I usually go in a car, but in a few weeks time my sister has a reward ceremony at her school. As a result of this my parents will be going to see her there and won't be able to pick me up, so I will have to take the bus instead.

The problem is I REALLY don't want to go on the bus. Now the reason for this isn't because I'm an entitled brat who thinks they are above the kids who go on the bus or anything like that. It's because it actually terrifies me. Last time I had to go on the bus some of the people who were on it kept looking at me, asking me why I was on the bus and telling me that I shouldn't be on the bus. I can't deal with the thought of going on it again. Ever since I was told I had to go on the bus I've been stressed out about it non-stop and as a result my concentration in school has gone down and I've barely been able to sleep. It doesn't help that on the day I have to go on the bus there is a school walking trip which is already stressful enough as I hate change and the day after there is a trip to a theme park which I'm also really apprehensive about. I know it's not normal to be this worked up about something like this, but when ever I think about it I feel sick and like I can't breathe properly, and I don't know why.

But anyway my dad has come up with an idea. He says that to avoid going on the bus I can stay at home and the school can be told that I'm sick . The only issue is my mum wants me to go in and go on the bus and due to that she wouldn't be told about the plan. So wibta if I stay at home to avoid going on the bus and lie to my mum about it."		1	0

I'm in a school program and I graduate in December. Post graduation, I'll be able to work pretty much anywhere. I HATE the state that I live in. I'm miserable here - the weather, the culture, the politics. It's just not home to me, and never has been. Previously I had resigned myself to living here forever, because my ex will be here forever.

Now that I'm single again, I've been exploring the idea of moving. Namely to the east coast. I've always wanted to go there and I feel like this is my chance. I have a trip planned in September to get a feel for the area and where I might want to live. I might put some applications in.

The asshole part comes in because we have kids. I'd never force them to come with me, and they are old enough to make their own choices about where they want to live.

But will I be an asshole putting them in the situation? Having them make a choice? I can't imagine being stuck here for another 6 years (until my youngest graduates), but I don't want to fuck up my kids lives.

TIA

Edit for a little more info: I'm going into the medical field (nursing), and the east coast offers some of the best hospitals in the world. That's a huge factor in why I want to move there. I'll make at least twice what I'd make here, and have lots of opportunities in my career.

c3u1ew	2019-06-22 19:56:44	tandoori_taco_cat	AITA for not contacting my grandmother	"For about 8 years (ages 28-36) I (38F) tried really hard to connect with my grandmother (80sF) who lives on another continent. I spent thousands flying to see her, and hours cleaning up her neglected garden / patio and the damage caused by many pets. She wasn't too keen on me doing this, as she treasured her independence, but was patient with my desire to 'help'. I did get the feeling that she wasn't sorry to see me go at the end of my visits, though. Maybe I was a bit overbearing and pushy, I don't know, but it's certainly possible.

She's also an alcoholic, so I watched her get drunk every night of my visit and listen to her stories. I also had to occasionally listen to her harshly criticize my family members ie. mother and sisters.

I would call her regularly, and although she never called me I would get cards on holidays.

Two years ago, when I knew she would be alone on a special holiday and grieving a close friend I went to visit with my husband. I asked what her plans were when her health declined (she's in her 80s). She blew up and screamed at me.

We left a day later, and she hung up on me when I tried to call and apologize.

Since then, I haven't contacted her. She has sent at least 3 cards with no message, just her signature.

I don't want to contact her. I feel very guilty for breaking the connection, but .. I just don't want to be in touch with her anymore. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3u0su	2019-06-22 19:55:07	gutsandhoney	AITA for not wanting to pick up my friends?	"So, for context, I live in a pretty small town, and I have 
a pretty large group of friends. Some of them I’m 
really close with, some not so much, but we always 
hang out together. I’m 17, and one of the only people 
that can drive that lives close by. A good majority of
 my friend group is boys, so sometimes they hang out 
alone and whatnot which is perfectly fine. I want to 
add that these people are genuinely my friends, and I 
don’t think they’re solely using me, because they 
invite me places, they talk to me, and we’ve all known 
each other a long long time. 

I got my car last September, and was more than 
willing to drive some of my friends home after 
practice every day from school. After a while though, 
some of them who lived pretty far away started 
asking for rides, or would literally just get in my car 
and expect me to drive them. From all the people I 
drove, I never got a single cent of gas money. I’m 
pretty shy to ask for money, but the one time I asked, 
they said no, because they were ‘broke’. But I still 
drove them all home and stuff because I didn’t want 
them to be stranded at the school. Fast forward to 
summer (now), and I feel like things have gotten out 
of hand, to the point where I put my foot down and 
feel like a jerk. 

Multiple times, they’ve had parties/overnight hang 
outs/etc with just the boys, or sometimes even both 
genders, where I’m NOT invited, but they’ll text me 
the next morning or that night asking if I can pick 
them up and take them home. I got a text from my 
friend, who’s actually my neighbor, saying he needed 
a way home ASAP, and I would be his only option. 
Like, dude, why didn’t you plan this in advance? I’m 
not your mom. I made up lies and said I was busy, 
even though I wasn’t, because I was just at home 
relaxing after a stressful week. I felt bad, because I 
lied to my friend, and definitely could have picked him
 up, especially because he needed to urgently. But 
then again, I don’t think it’s fair to me to expect me to 
drop everything and drive 15 minutes to a hangout I 
wasn’t even invited to to take someone home. This 
has happened in other situations as well, and 
sometimes I feel like they might just invite me places 
because they need someone to drive them (Even 
though I do believe they genuinely are my friends 
besides this). 

I would lastly like to add that 1. I have to pay for my 
own gas and 2. If a friend was drunk or in a bad 
situation at a party or event I would definitely drive 
there ASAP to get them, without a second thought. 
But these situations are not those.

them rides?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"OK so I start grad school in September, across the country from where I currently live. I lived in an apartment until June 15, when my lease ended. My parents invited me to live with them, rather than subleasing, so I could save more money which I happily accepted. I have a GREAT relationship with both my parents so I was looking forward to spending more time with them before moving away.

My parents recently downsized from the house I grew up in to a smaller condo. In our old house, my parents room and my room were on opposite sides of the house so I never heard much of anything. In the condo, my room is directly next to my parents room. Also, my parents both retired early (they're in their mid-50s) so they don't have a set schedule or anything. I still have a 9-5 job that I'll be at until mid-August.

Since I moved in on Sunday, my parents have had loud, screaming sex EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. I'm happy they're happy but it's a little much. I've tried earplugs and everything but they're just so loud. I think I've slept maybe 4 hours each night since moving in. I worked from home yesterday because I was so physically exhausted that I couldn't make it into the office.

I went to my friend's house for dinner. His wife was cooking and did a few courses. We had chicken and fish and samosas and other stuff. During the meal I felt my stomach rumble as I have IRS. But thought it was safe. I didn't want to fart in front of them so kept going to the bathroom and farting into the toilet. 

Anyway. When the food is done they go to do the washing up. So when I need to fart again I do but it wasn't safe this time. I shit down the chair and all over the cream carpet. I panicked and didn't know what to do so I just went home and text my friend I think he spilled some burgundy sauce on the carpet.

A few days passed and I thought I'd gotten away with it. Then my friend said they had to get the carpet replaced and he wasn't happy. But I said **I will pay for the new carpet**. I paid for the new carpet but now he's still not talking to me. I think it's no harm no foul.

c3tudo	2019-06-22 19:38:42	Reinnxddd	AITA for pressuring my jobless friend to give me back the money he owes me?	"So, a bit of backstory. A few months ago BTS announced that they were going on tour and me and my friend were very excited for this; however, I couldn’t afford the tickets at the time, so my friend bought 2 as long as I paid him back for the ticket. 

Skip to a couple of months later, and I’ve paid him the £75 for the ticket and great!!! Woo!!! We’re excited!!! Until I had a small and stupid argument with this friend and in the heat of the argument said “give my ticket away to someone else, I don’t care anymore”. We sorted things out and I was under the impression we were still going together since there was no way he could’ve gave my ticket away in one night.

Yeah no I was wrong. 

A week before the concert I ask him what’s happening since we hadn’t spoken about it much since the argument. To which I get a reply saying he “gave my ticket away the morning after our argument”. I was beyond pissed and demanded that I get my money back, which he agreed to do. 

He still had a job at this point so he was able to give me £30 straight away leaving me under the impression that I would get my money back relatively soon. This was until 2 weeks ago where he said he got fired from his job. Me being selfish only thought about the money, but I thought I should leave him for a few days until he figures it out. 

I start asking him about the money situation a week later to then get called an asshole since I’m not thinking about his financial situation, and that I should be patient and wait.

c3tshw	2019-06-22 19:33:30	thegreengobshite	AITA for making my husband be the bad guy?	"My husband John and I have two kids: Sarah and James, twins, age 3 (all fake names).

Sarah recently got into having her nails painted. John wasn't totally comfortable with it because he thinks make-up is weird and adult-looking on a toddler. I argued that she just likes the colour and it's fairly normal for a toddler to have painted nails. He asked what I would do if James wanted his nails painted. I said it would do it if asked but I wouldn't push it on him. James did ask to have his nails painted, but after one nail was done he decided he didn't like it and we took off the polish.

A week or so later, Sarah was getting her nails painted and James asked to get his done too so I painted them. He really liked it this time.

John freaked out and demanded that the polish was taken off. We argued a few points and his main arguments were:

1. It's a slippery slope from nail polish to a full face with foundation, lipstick and eyeliner

2. Women only wear nail polish to make themselves more attractive to men, therefore I am trying to make our kid attractive

3. The other kids in the creche would make fun of him 

I argued back that the slippery slope argument is bullshit, women paint their nails for many reasons and we should not teach our son to care what other people think about his appearance.

He accused me of not understanding where he's coming from. I do, I just don't agree with him. I think there are other issues behind his discomfort but that's another conversation.

In the end, I told John that he could remove the nail polish and in the future he could tell our son no when he asks for his nails to be painted.

John said that I was forcing him to be the bad guy and he wasn't going to do that, so our son has pink fingernails and my husband is not happy.

AITA for making my husband the (potential) bad guy?

Edit - thanks for all the responses, plenty to think about here. I've always been aware that I'm more liberal than my husband but our differences are deeper than I thought so we have a lot of talking to do.

Regarding the nail polish, we are taking it off tomorrow. Our family will visit my FIL in the hospice and he will definitely make homophobic comments about it. He's got dementia and will never change. My husband adores his dad and doesn't want to fight with him.


Edit 2: The amount of anger in many responses is peculiar and the suggestion that only people with the right attitudes should have kids is... disturbing.

Many thanks again to those who responded thoughtfully to an internet stranger, I really appreciate it.

My husband has a fucked up understanding of sexuality, passed down from his abused, oppressed and repressive parents. They had him late in life so they are closer in age to the grandparents of my generation than the parents. We are not going to change them but we can and will work on ourselves.

c3tqil	2019-06-22 19:28:23	helptryingto	AITA for surprising my (42m) wife (33f) of five years with a new wardrobe for our anniversary?	"Since turning thirty, my wife has gotten really self conscious about her looks. In her youth, she was the center of attention. She's tall, blonde, and has beautiful blue eyes. However, some lines are beginning to form on her face and she is beginning to see the effects of using tanning beds and spending so much time in the sun over the years. She spends an hour in the bathroom mirror every night with retinol and a few other products - and in the morning trying to restore her old face using makeup. In addition, she has gained around 20 pounds, though I believe she still falls within a healthy weight range.

I'm very into weight lifting and have kept my appearance clean. I mostly stayed out of the sun and more or less look the same as I did on our wedding day. This has made my wife very nervous - she frequently jokes about me leaving her for a younger woman, which I never would. We are upper class, and appearances are a big deal in many circles, which is probably one of the reasons why my wife is acting this way.

When my wife gained weight, she started hiding her new figure as well. She donated most of her old, slim-fitting clothes and replaced them with flowy, baggy garments. So for our five year anniversary (last week), I decided to change her wardrobe back. In order to make time for the switch, I surprised her and her closest friends with a weekend Bahamas trip.

I hired a stylist specifically to figure out what clothes would look good on my wife. The stylist said that once she wore slim-fitting clothes that were her new size, she would feel better about herself. She said the problem was that my wife probably didn't like her body squeezed into her old clothes.

I wanted to bring back my wife's sex appeal and make her feel better about herself. All of the clothes and stylist cost me about $15,000, but we are not pressed for money.

When my wife came home and saw the change, she freaked out. Screaming, crying, saying this was confirmation I don't believe she's beautiful as she is. She also freaked out about me having the ""attractive"" stylist in the house while she was away on vacation. I'm not into women in their 20's anymore - they honestly look like children to me.

She went to sleep at a friend's house - that was last week and she hasn't texted me since. I feel firmly that I was in the right, but maybe I wasn't. Reddit, AITA?

TL;DR - my wife has started to cover up with age - i changed her wardrobe back as a surprise

UPDATE

I spent all night gathering my thoughts and considering the feedback I was given. One user suggested I buy my wife flowers, so I bought her a bouquet of roses. I also assembled a small scrapbook full of photos of us over the years and wrote little memories of the moments we shared beside the photos.

Went over to my wife's friend's house unannounced to finally see my wife. It was honestly only a 25 min walk away because she lives nearby in D.C., so it wasn't as dramatic as you're imagining. No boom box and signs, folks.

Here is a picture I took on my walk this morning: https://imgur.com/pfVJ4hV. I took this partially for the people crying fake (though I know they still will) and partially for your visualization of the setting. Reverse image search it - you won't find anything.

I walked up the stairs and knocked. I could hear her friend come to the door, but she didn't answer right away. I figure she was warning my wife. When she let me in, I found my wife sitting on the living room couch. I put the flowers on the coffee table in front of her.

Immediately, my wife started freaking out again and crying. This was very awkward because the place is small and there was no privacy from her friend. She asked why I had waited a week to talk to her and I told her I figured she wanted space. I'm really not good at games and don't understand them.

I know what the sub said, but I still asked my wife what she felt the problem was with me replacing her clothes. She told me again that I didn’t think she was good enough and that I had discarded some of her favorite pieces. I told her I had seen the change in her clothes as a decline in her self esteem. She denied this and said I was assuming she felt that way, which made it even worse.

I knew this was a lie and rebutted with the fact that she had accused me of looking at other women on several occasions recently, when she never had before.

I told my wife I still found her attractive, even though we have both gotten older. She freaked out and focused on the word “still,” like me thinking she was beautiful at 33 was a massive effort. One user suggested that I offer her 15k worth of skin treatments and to give her a shopping budget to get clothes she genuinely likes and so I did.

She said this offer was missing the point. She started wailing about how when she was with me and my “judgmental friends” all she could focus on was her flaws. She said most of my friends are on their 3rd-4th divorces (which is true) and that their wives just keep getting younger and younger. She said she has heard my friends objectify women and say awful things about them. She admitted she felt nervous that I would do the same, as evidenced by me switching out her wardrobe with clothes I found sexier.

I gave her the book and she cried a lot flipping through the pages. I told her I loved her and that no one could ever replace her. I know that nobody could. I told her if she turned 60 that instant I'd still love her. Someone told me to literally get on my knees, so I did. I got on my knees and swore I would never do something that stupid again.

She started laughing really hard and told me I was an idiot and to get off the floor. Then we went home. I know this sounds like a ""and then everyone clapped"" scenario, but in my mind everyone did clap as soon as my wife started laughing. I hope you guys clap at least."	Asshole	0	0

So yesterday I went to grab coffee with my grandpa and he picked me up from my house like any other day. He is always really insistent that he is a perfect driver but he is getting really old now. We were driving and I noticed he was literally driving in the middle of a 2 way busy road. I grabbed the wheel to correct him and he flipped. Started saying how that was unsafe and we both could’ve died. I obviously passed it off as angry old people yelling and I didn’t really care. For some reason he brought it up again and I told him I wasn’t sure if it was safe for him to drive. He got really pissed but besides a little swerving he wasn’t that bad  at driving. However, for some reason I just never felt safe in a car he is driving. This might be because he is kinda slow to react( I know a lot of older people are like this). I think he is still really angry and I wanted to go to reddit to ask if I should apologize and if I am the asshole. Regardless we love each other I just don’t want to give into something I believe is true.
Edit: I realize I should’ve made this clear it was a BUSY road and there was oncoming traffic they wasn’t too far away. Probably not enough time for him to react had I said something."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Hello, I’m 21 and have Depression, Anxiety, a Hoarding problem, ADHD, and my Therapist highly suspects I’m on the spectrum, I actually agree with her. I’ve told my mom about all of this and both my therapist and my Psychiatrist have brought up the idea of getting me tested in the past. I think it’s a great idea but my mom told me that it was expensive. Recently my therapist brought it up again to my mom because a diagnosis could help me in future endeavors like jobs, or going back to school (which I want to do despite not having the future plan or confidence to do so), my mom rejected the idea because we “already tested for that in elementary school when she got tested for ADHD” despite the fact that I’m pretty sure the two tests are very different. 
My therapist and I decided to just send in my information to a testing place so they would have it and part of that information included my insurance which could probably pay for part of it. 
The issue is that it’s my parents insurance and I am not telling my mom I’m getting tested if I go through with it.
My mom supports me in a lot of ways but she has really only supported my mental health monetarily, buying my medications, and paying for therapist and Psychiatrist visits. When my Therapist texted her about me talking to someone who could help me recently she called me down and basically ranted at me how a diagnosis wouldn’t change how I’m basically too lazy to get a real job (I work Part Time in the Winner’s Circle at D&B) or clean my room.
My mom has a problem with not thinking my mental health is a big deal, she thinks my hoarding problem (that she herself called a hoarding problem) could be fixed by just cleaning my room, and that my depression could be fixed by cleaning my room and spending less time online or playing video games in my room (not even considering that those things might be symptoms of my depression as opposed to causes). 
Despite all this I feel super guilty going behind my parents backs and potentially on their dime to get this test, even if I feel like I need the answers it could provide, also that such answers could make her finally take my mental health seriously. I just feel so guilty especially since I tell her everything and kinda rely on her for some stuff. Would I be the asshole if I do this?
TL;DR: Would I be the asshole if I went behind my parents back and got Austism testing on their insurance because I feel like I need it but know they won’t understand?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3tksc	2019-06-22 19:13:23	nz8drzu6	AITA for making my friends pay for an event they flaked on?	"I hosted a laser tag event for a friend's birthday and booked the entire room at this venue, so it was a fixed cost regardless of number of attendees. Originally 15 people signed up on Facebook and the price was roughly $15 per person. On the day of the event, 2 cancelled so everyone would pay a little more-everyone was ok with this. At the actual event, only 9 people showed up, the others flaked without messaging us ahead of time. The majority of us (who showed up) agreed to split it 13-way as we could've gotten a smaller room if we knew it was only gonna be us 9 rather than paying for the bigger room.

I ended up sending the $17.31 invoice to the 4 people who bailed and some of them got upset at me for having to pay for an event they didn't go to. One of them had a family emergency, but the others had no good excuse other than they forgot/changed their minds. They argued that it was poor taste to not let them know ahead of time of this policy (to be honest, the 9 of us made it up on the spot). But to have each of us pay $25 instead of $17.31 because 4 people couldn't be bothered to let us know they weren't gonna make it isn't fair either.

A middle aged man with a chequered shirt and gilet was asking a female customer in Burger King, Central Station, why she should get service before him (there was a queue and he ignored it and walked to the from counter).
She laughed and shrugged him off but he continued the 'banter' with his hand on his shoulder and walked her over to the server. He asked why she wasn't severed first and announced he thought it was meraculous he got attention after he had a mid twenties girl on his arm.
They all jokingly shrugged this off with (imo) fake smiles.
After the man was served, I asked him why he felt the need to act so rude to the customers and staff.
He then proceeded to be very offended by the notion and demanded to know when I was born and how old I was. I refused to tell him this, as I didn't see it's relevance to how he acted towards the staff.
His friend came over at this point, after buying mini bottle of wine at the nearby (next door) m&s food market. He automatically became hostile (understandably) due to his friend, now, through his own devising, being in a hostile situation. 
No curse words were thrown either way, until they ended up walking off with him calling me an entitled prick (ironically). 
Afterwards I asked the burger King employee if he thought the man was rude. He has said 'yes but I'm used to it'. The lady behind me in the queue said I was brave for voicing my opinion and calling him out on his rudeness.

So my family has been planning a huge trip for the last year. Some of us live in Canada and the rest live throughout South America. Originally me and my fiance were excited for the trip since it would be shortly after our graduation. 

My fiance ended up getting a job with a major accounting firm in a different city. The money is great but she doesn't start for a few months. We have saved really well for a while and are very cautious with our finances. 

My family on the other hand is of the mindset that money easily comes and goes. I told my family the trip was out of our budget. The tickets would be about 700 a person and they told us the place was all inclusive. I looked up the hotel and it is definitely not all inclusive. The flight as well would also have 3 layovers with the tickets my mom wants to buy and take over a day of travel. 

We would be looking at around 3000 for the trip total and thats 3 months worth of rent at the new house we are getting. I've had a few family members offer to loan me the money but I have a rule about borrowing money from anyone, especially family.

My family loans money to each other all the time but, once you take a loan from a family member, everyone in the family feels entitled to your money because ""the family helped you so now it's your turn to help family. I understand helping people, but theres alot of people who only take money and never help others in my family.

Now my family is pissed off at me and saying I don't care about family. Should I suck up my pride and just go or am I being smart."	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

Currently 21 years old. Mom and dad divorced when I was 16, dad was very violent towards me and to some extent towards my mom, but not as much as he rarely was home when mom was due to work times. So they divorced and my mom is alone with me and she promised me things would get better after their divorce. I felt alone and my mom focused more on her working career (atleast it paid off for her and makes more then enough money) then spending time with me and showing me love. I feel maybe emotionally destroyed because of the abuse and no love from my mom. 

I let her know how I feel and that I want to do normal shit like go on a vacation or anything nice, why wouldn't she do it? Its not like the money is the problem. She says yeah sounds like a nice idea, but whenever I suggest it she doesn't care and says she can hand me money and I can travel alone. Years pass on and nothing has improved. My mom still married to her job, not giving a shit about me and only chases the money. Im fed up and started not giving a shit at home anymore as I feel like I'm starting to get crazy.

&#x200B;

So I suggest I move into one of her apartments that she rents out so I can live by myself so we don't annoy each other more, of course I would pay rent as normal. Nope. No way in hell. Its so bad that I barely want to have anything to do with my own mother. I don't really know how to describe it.

c3tiir	2019-06-22 19:07:15	bellabean	AITA for not wanting to text my mom when I get home every night so she doesn’t worry	"For context, I am a 22 year old female who just finished university away from home and will be moving out of state for graduate school in a month. I pay my own rent and tuition but my parents cover my health/auto insurance and phone bill. Overall I have a pretty good relationship with my parents. 

As the title says, my mom and I recently got into some beef because I went out with friends last night and forgot to respond to her goodnight text until this morning. On the phone with her this morning, she said she expects me to let her know when I get home every night especially once I move to start school again in another state. I speak to my parents 1-2  times a week and text my mom almost every day mostly in response to her various “How are you doing/Goodnight” texts but sometimes I text her first too to share pics and whatnot. I’ll talk to my dad less than that but he doesn’t seem to need more frequent communication than a phone call every week or two.  

From my perspective, I think it’s a little unreasonable for my mom to need to know I make it home every night. I’m generally a good kid; I’ve never gotten into any trouble, I don’t really even go out that much, and I have good friends who look out for me. I don’t know why the default for her is that something bad happened to me if I don’t respond soon or that same night. I don’t even mind texting my mom more than most people do but it’s when I forget to respond or take to long to reply and she gets mad or passive aggressive with me that bothers me about the whole thing. 

From my moms perspective, I guess she’s just trying to look out for me so her intentions are good at least. It doesn’t actually take too much effort on my part to send her an “I’m home” text so she doesn’t worry even if I’m not home yet which I’ve done before. She also pays for my phone bill so I don’t know if that entitles her to requiring me to text her even though she hasn’t threatened (yet) to stop paying for my phone which I’m not sure I could afford to cover myself.  

I’ve tried to talk to her about it before and figure out when I’ll need to stop having to text her every night but she kind of implies never.

Apologies I am on mobile and not a native speaker. So I am currently living abroad UK with my SO and was thinking visiting my home country sometime in the future. However my parents no longer live there, they moved to Canada some time recently. 

I was chatting with my friends and one of them offered a guest room in his parents house where he lives. He said no sex is allowed there and to bring my own sheets if I wanted to have any. We have been friends for more than 10 years, we joke around constantly, insult each other, etc. I asked why not? We are all adults here, sex is normal and healthy. I was being serious and argued as well that you can have sex without a bed.

Well, what does everybody think? Would I be the asshole if I had sex in my friend's guest room?

c3te8m	2019-06-22 18:56:18		AITA for mentioning to my girlfriend of five years that she could freeze her eggs after deciding I don't know if I want to have kids?	"Some backstory: my girlfriend wants to get married and have kids someday. We're 27/28 years old and have been together for almost 5 years, and have been living together for the past year.

&#x200B;

Anyway, we recently had a heated argument about having kids because I said I wasn't sure if I wanted to have them, and she was upset because she thought I had mentioned I wanted to have kids too at least a few times during our time with each other. We have this argument, she says she has a biological clock, and she has to have kids before 35, or around then, which I agreed made sense. However, I felt that I can't commit to that because I honestly don't know if I want kids in 5, years, or ever.

&#x200B;

I talked to my sister about this argument and she asked me if my girlfriend considered freezing her eggs. Inevitably, my girlfriend and I have this discussion again because it's important, and I said something like, ""there's other options, you could adopt or maybe freeze your eggs?"" And she seemed annoyed in the moment, but later she decided it was really messed up that I suggested that, as did her friends. She told her friends (and family?) I said that, and she said people seemed pretty annoyed. Was I being obnoxious or insensitive or something? 

&#x200B;

And to be clear, I haven't urged her to do that for the sake of us staying together, I was just mentioning it as an option for her in general. It's possible she was more annoyed about the insensitivity of the question, or maybe she was deep down more annoyed about my lack of commitment to kids/marriage in general. Also should note that people on reddit told me what an incredibly brutal procedure freezing eggs can be.

c3te39	2019-06-22 18:55:50	scumfederate	AITA for not wearing my sister-in-laws wedding colors?	"UPDATE: there’s a lot of you asking for an update, so here it goes, although it’s not much of an update. My husband went along with the dress request, as he already had clothes that fit the bill. I didn’t explain or consult her and wore what I had already purchased. 

She didn’t say anything (honestly I don’t think she noticed). Her wedding party matched; her family sort of had a color scheme...maybe 50/50. I didn’t stick out at all, and I only needed to be in two pictures anyway. She was super stressed before the wedding (it was an outdoor wedding and it poured rain before the ceremony), so when the ceremony and reception went off smoothly I think she was able to relax. She was a beautiful bride and her reception was well done. 

Thank you for all for helping me feel much less guilty about possibly contributing to a bride’s stress on her big day! 


Tl;Dr AITA if I don’t wear my SIL’s wedding colors, because she only told me I had to 3 hours before her wedding?

My sister-in-law (husband’s ex-step-sister) is getting married today. She got engaged in December 2018. 

We need to leave for the wedding in about 3.5 hours, and she just texted my husband to ask what we both planned on wearing. He told her (both nice outfits, nothing casual or over-the-top), she said no. She told him he needed to wear khaki pants, which is no big deal, as he has some. She then told him I needed to be wearing purple or tan. She’s never mentioned that we need to wear anything specific before today, or anything really about the plans of the day other than what time to arrive. My husband and her are close, so information isn’t hard to pass between the two of them. 

I don’t own anything (literally nothing) in either of those colors. I’m also not in the wedding party (neither is my husband). I don’t feel like going shopping and rushing to find something, especially as I live in a small town where there’s not a lot of options to begin with. 

Am I the asshole if I show up wearing the outfit I already bought, but isn’t a part of her color scheme? I don’t want to ruin her photos (which, am I even going to be in them? I didn’t think so), but this seems ridiculous to me. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3tcu0	2019-06-22 18:52:47		AITA for asking my mom to stop making faces in public?	"Long one here and also on mobile so please forgive any grammatical errors, spelling errors, etc. Here we go.

So my family and I decided to go out to lunch with our puppy. When we reached the restaurant, there was a 30 minute wait, so we walked the dog around for a little bit. When we got back to the front of the restaurant, my dad noticed another dog with a retractable leash, and asked my mom about it. Our leash is pretty short and worn out, so I understand why he asked about it. However, this is where things get rough.

My dad has asked about the leash before, but this is the first time in a few months. My mom has also explained why we don't have a big retractable one to him a few times. - Now here's the point where I need to note some of my mom's really bad habjts. She has a really short temper and has a bad habit of acting poorly or immaturely in public. She also tends to believe her opinion is always correct, and shuts down others for their opinions rather quickly. - So naturally, without having a rational conversation about the topic, my mom grew furious with my dad and walked away in a huff to sit on a bench with our dog. My dad was annoyed at this because our table was only two or three minutes away from being ready for us.

When we were called to be seated, I went to tell my mom, and noticed her muttering under her breath and making obnoxious facial expressions. I told her our table was ready and also said to stop making such expressions and using such language since we were in public. She then yelled at me because I was ""belittling her and making her feel small."" Then, at the table, she started the fight with my dad about the leash AGAIN, and dropped a few f bombs (I don't like to swear so I won't type it out), cried a little, and made a huge deal of the situation. More specifically, she said: ""all you guys want is for me to shut up. If I don't speak at all I won't get talked to like this.""

My mom has the tendency to do something wrong (get angry at my dad for no apparent reason) and flip things around to make it seem like she's the victim. This really annoys me, especially since I see things like this on the daily. I feel like she needs to learn some sense of public decency, and also learn that the world doesn't revolve around whatever she thinks or says. So Reddit, AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

c3tbgf	2019-06-22 18:49:02	some_uni_student	AITA for thinking my parents are annoying for constantly talking about my weight gain?	"For some background, I (19F) have recently went overseas for university and have been living alone for around 4 months. With major changes in life and some of the stress from university, I found myself having issues with emotional eating and lack of energy to exercise, and having unhealthy habits like sleeping late or having late dinners after 9. So weight gain was expected and I decided that I would try to fix my unhealthy habits during my break and get my shit together for the days to come

I have recently finished my first semester and was going back home to spend time with my family. My parents noticed that I packed on some pounds and made me get onto the scale once I got back home. They found out that I’ve gained around 12 lbs in the 4 months I was away. (I’m around 5’5 and weigh 158lbs when I weighed in, which I acknowledge that I’m 8lbs overweight at least.)

I have no issues with my parents saying that I should loose weight, since I would’ve voluntarily done it myself anyways to stay healthy and have a better figure. I just have an issue with them MAKING EVERYTHING ABOUT MY WEIGHT and how they criticise the things I do. 

For example, I’ve decided to pick back up on outdoor jogging recently (stopped for 5 years), so I’ll jog 4km every morning and run on the treadmill for 30 minutes every night. Yet my dad still says that ‘It’s not enough exercise’ and that ‘I should jog for more than 4km and run at least 3 times a day’. And if I go out alone, he’ll ask if I snacked on anything outside. He also said my reasons for ‘weigh gain by emotional eating’ were ‘mere excuses’. 

And my mom always randomly grab on my areas where I’ve gain (belly and thighs) randomly in the middle of a conversation, even if I’m uncomfortable about it. And most of the conversation she has with me are always about some diet or weight loss. 

They also won’t hesitate to publicly talk about my weight gain with relatives if they point it out, which I find rather embarrassing. 

I find their behaviour very overbearing, since I feel like they’re acting as if I’m going to be featured on ‘My 600lbs Life’ over a 12lbs weight gain from some easily changeable lifestyle choices that I’m working on changing. Their behaviour makes me feel very frustrated and I’m trying so hard not to snap at them, even I’m just a few days in. 

Tonight when I finished my nightly treadmill run, I was cooling down, my mom saw some of my belly fat sticking out, which she tried to run over and squeeze it. I dodged and slightly spoke up telling her that I don’t appreciate their behaviour and and that they’re kinda getting on my nerves. Then my mom said that I find them annoying just because ‘they’re saying things that I don’t like’ and that ‘she can’t control her mouth to comment on things her eyes see’.

BUT, because I know my wife tends to spend money in a selfish way, I contested the amount she wanted me to pay, and instead donate the difference to charity.

c3tadn	2019-06-22 18:46:12		AITA for breaking Sis-In-Law sunlounger and refusing to replace it?After doing garden work for free?	"Near to the top of the lounger(its a big sun lounger can hold about 3 or 4 people) so told the sister-in-law she complained a little,and I cracked on with getting this garden done,so 2 days later,I get a phone call showing that the sun lounger had now was ripped off alltogether,the entire sheet in the middle was taken off,and they said that I broke it so I shoud replace it.but I said no.

So time goes on,I end up finishing off the work in the garden move 2.5 ton of soil using a wheel barrow and shovel on my own so I said to my brother once the weather is good to flatten the garden so my brother and cousin do just that,another few days later had the turf delivered he was working so asked if I could move the turf of rolls that just been delviered,so I do exactly that granted it was raining i moved 60 rolls of turf.

I then start doing the turf putting it down,got half way but the rain was getting worse so had to stop,few days later weather was good,ground was a little boggy,I said too him that he can finish it off if he wanted,but he done area and give up,so I ended up going over again to finish the garden off. So garden looks all good.

But despite doing all that,they still moan about this sun lounger,nevermind i moved 2.5 tons of soil 60 rolls of turf,turned the garden over,put the turf down they complain about that one little thing.

Fast forward to today 22/06/2019,again my brother phones saying his wife bought the wrong TV wall bracket and asked if I had any spare,now I have changed my tv's a few times for both my self and my parents ,so I had a few spare,went over put the bracket on the back of the tv(part of it) required 4 little screws put it on,the tv was resting on the arm rest of his couch when I got there so I thought ah well he put it there.

So I told him that he can carry the tv into the room he want's it in, and he can hold the tv while I attatch the bracket on the wall, to the back of the bracket on the tv. So done all that,a few hours later get a phone call saying the TV has a crack in it,low and behold I get the blame.

He was like ""you must of pushed down on it when you was putting the screws in"",the screws was not long enough to go that deep into the tv,and they are screws you don't need to push down on fecking screws that hard when they have a slot to go in.

The only screws that went in were literally tiny,and having put up multiple tv's on the wall I would know if I screwed up(pun intended) and screwed the screw to deep.

 I have never asked him for money for doing any work in his garden or his house as he is my brother and my parents brought me up to always help out family when you can...

So AITA?  in all of this?"		1	0

Lots of social engagements approaching and I'm the MoH. There's a girl in the wedding party who treats me (imo) like total shit and I don't know whether I should: 

a) greyrock her (a method of becoming boring to slough off the attention of the drama seeking sociopathic narcissist) or if I should 

b) kill her with kindness. 

&#x200B;

Things she has done to me since it was announced that Evelyn is getting engaged: 

1. Said that I shouldn't be MoH and stand beside Eve for 'aesthetic' reasons, I would look best ""at the end""
2. Said in the group chat that she doesn't think asian features are pretty (I'm asian lol) 
3. Asked how much money my boyfriend makes and why he didn't buy my dress (I guess her boyfriend bought her bridesmaid dress. Shit was over $300) 
4. Called dibs on not sleeping in the same room as me for our AirBNB for the bachelorette party
5. Said I wasn't a real friend to Evelyn because they've known each other for way longer
6. Asked what clothes I'll be packing for our bach party weekend because she doesn't want our pictures to look bad

&#x200B;

To be honest, I revel in her dislike for me, because I think she's a bad person. I just want to look better than her in these coming weeks, so how do I make out to be the least asshole-ish? WIBTA if I greyrocked her? Or is greyrocking more graceful than killing w kindness?

"Please note I'm not talking about gender identity, I'm all for people using whatever facility their comfortable with. I'm talking about women getting annoyed with long lines for their restroom and using the men's restroom.

Basically, busy brewery I often go to has a men's room and a women's room - 3 toilets in each. As is the usual case when people drink, people pee, and women generally take longer than men. Creating long lines for the women's room (10+ women waiting outside), while there is rarely more than 2 or 3 men in line for the men's room.

On multiple occasions I've seen groups of women try to execute (and sometimes succeed) a hostile takeover of the men's room. Creating 2 women's room and no men's room. If I'm waiting in line I call them out everytime, and refuse to let anyone cut the line, and insist on them waiting for their own respective room.

I've gotten dirty looks from the women waiting in line quite a few times, but whatever, your pee is no more important than mine.

My brother recently invited me to play dungeons and dragons with him (turned out to be a thing with multiple of my siblings and their SO's) and initially I was excited because every other time I've ever played I've ended up being stuck being dungeon master (which I accepted because I got our last group together) and I wasn't good at it so I mostly used premade campaigns and let my players do whatever. So needless to say I was excited to be a player for the first time and started coming up with character ideas, only to find out that he wanted us to play character that he had made for us. When I tried to argue with him about how creating your own character is a huge part of the game and how I didn't want to skip this part on my first time being a player character, I was basically told that I could ""choose"" (in quotes because everyone else either has already chosen their character or will definitely get to choose before me leaving me with whatever is leftover) my person out of the premade characters or not play at all. He did say I would eventually get to make my own when later after our character die but he says that will be 9-10 sessions in and we only plan on meeting twice a month so this would be almost half a year into us playing. Which is a whole nother can of worms. I don't like because by then I would have been playing and leveling a character for HALF A YEAR. I basically told my brother that dealing with your players decisions is part of being a dungeon master and that the game is supposed to allow more freedom than me being forced to be a specific character. Edit: everyone in the group has played the game before, there are no new players and I'm the only person who has not been a player character. They are not using a premade campaign the people who have already chosen their characters are helping the DM write the campaign."	No A-holes here	0	0

I’m in a bad place both physically and mentally. Even though I’m talking to a therapist and I’m on several different medications, my depression is at an all time high. I’m not overweight or underweight, but I just don’t have the energy or desire to do anything anymore. Even performing basic needs such as food and hygiene has become a chore. 

I know I need to change and I’ve been trying, just not sure how. I figure the best place to start is to get all of the toxic people out of my life.

I don’t have any family or friends around. Everyone that I’ve even given my time too I’ve met online. There is a group of people I use to call friends when I started gaming with them a few years ago. We spent countless hours together just playing all kind of games. Lately though, I don’t have the urge to play with them. It’s been a few months now since I’ve even had contact with them, so Idk if they’ll even notice if I just disappear.

They are the kind of friends I’ve enjoyed spending time with, but not the type I’d want to share my feelings to. So WIBTA if I just “disappear” and cut off communications with them? Or should I talk to them and let them know what’s going on before I do cut them off?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Because of this she’s always really tired, so I’d get why she’d want to start looking for something better. Here’s the problem tho, mum has this tendency to do things without thinking them through. Become a life Insurance salesperson because a friend mentioned it, move to Florida because she was bored and her friends from over there were egging her on, telling her  “Oh YeS!!! EvERYthInG isSS SO muCH beTteR in Florida.” (Yeah we learned the hard way it wasn’t, and said friends no longer speak to her). And now recently she’s been getting this itch of starting a business which somehow led to the idea of taking nail art classes and getting a license. Of course I’m like hold up where is this even coming from? According to her, her friends from work told her that the nail business has been booming and that she should consider it. So I lost it. All the frustration of the move (she lost 2000 in Christmas bonus because her friend said she had to come before October “because the  job she had for her wouldn’t last forever”), her refusal to listen to me on various other occasions which resulted in it blowing up in her face just made me downright tell her that the way she was approaching was idiotic and that life didn’t work that easily, she even admitted that she doesn’t even know the starting salary of a nail artist in a salon,  and she’s already planning to dish out 1000 dollars and two months time on a stupid urge. It ended up with her telling me that I always criticize her actions and that my negative attitude would bring me down, her eyes even got misty so I can tell I hurt her feelings really badly. I did tell talk to her in a harsh manner (which I really hate about myself). I just really want her to think things through before taking action.

Until today I didn't know my ex girlfriend was also invited. Nobody told me and now my parents are telling me I'm overreacting and that it shouldn't matter. It's a small party, max. 8 people INCLUDING my ex. For context, me and my ex are both 21 and we were together for 5 years. We were living together until last month when we decided to both move out on a break. We still love each other, I deeply care about her and I want to be with her. But living together wasn't working out and we decided to go on a break after our lease ended. We talked a lot, lots of tears on both sides.. I wanted to go no contact, she begged to stay in touch but I couldn't do it. Haven't talked to her since the beginning of this month, which has been excruciating btw. 

My sister adores my ex. She's great with children in general and my sister grew up with her around a lot.. Pretty sure she likes her more than me hah.. My parents love her too and they decided to invite her. She accepted it, but didn't tell me anything. If I didn't find out from my sister I wouldn't have known until she shows up today. I'm pissed that nobody told me and I want to leave, but it's my sister's birthday and I don't want to ruin it by leaving, she wants me here too.. Everyone is making me feel like I'm the crazy one for being upset she's invited, and that it would crush my sister if she didn't come. Now I am stressing the fuck out because I don't know how either of us are going to react when we see each other. I want this to be about my sister's birthday, not me or my ex. My parents say everything will be fine and to just enjoy the time together. 

Am I out of line? They're making me feel like I'm being super unreasonable for being angry she's invited because ""she's part of the family"". I understand that she's coming for my sister, but I already know we're ""suddenly"" going to be left alone in the same room hoping we are going to talk.

&#x200B;

Last night in my group chat I was talking with my friends when I started joking about writing them a ""paragraph"". These are basically just roasts that are meant to be overly rude and hurtful. They started out as a way for me to vent about people I didn't like but eventually developed into a joke because I showed my friends them and they found my insults humorous. Anyway, I was saying stuff like ""don't mess with me or i'll write you a paragraph"" and he kept insisting I do it. I asked him multiple times if he was sure, and my friends even warned him not to ask for it. He still insisted anyways so I wrote him one. Being completely honest it was one of the meaner ones. My friends described it as ruthless and brutal. I have some misgivings about this person so I vented my frustrations with him through this. He read it and seemed genuinely hurt even though we warned him and had told him not to take this whole thing to heart. Now i'm worried I've gone a bit to far.

&#x200B;

So, AITA for writing something that would hurt him even though he insisted I do it?


Edit: General consensus is that I was in the wrong. I apologized to him for being over the top and mean. Luckily he accepted.

Edit 2: People keep asking for the roast so here it is

You're the type of insecure asshole who thinks hes better than everyone else. Ur so upset with urself that u feel the need to compensate by one upping everyone if they have any skill even SLIGHTLY better than yours. You cant let anything be original. Your whole personality is stolen and fake. Your the type of person with 1000 acquaintances but no friends. Ur self image is about as frail and malformed as you are. Everyone you know has something bad to say about you cause in reality people only tolerate you so you'll fuck off and leave them alone. The amount of people who talk shit behind your back is staggering and its sad really, because you turned from someone who was genuinely a nice guy to a disgusting douche because you cant live with who you actually are."

Alright so.....Partner is getting onto highway but chilling in the merging lane (all the way to the right). I say, “Hey babe, are you going to get over?” He says “Yeah don’t worry about it.” 

Ok.

Then the lane runs out.  And only at this point does he look over his left shoulder to assess other traffic. 

Alright. Now there’s a vehicle in their lane, right next to us (to our left), and our lane has ended.  

All I can see is huge SUV about to sideswipe us.  

So our car jerks to the right and heads right over the wake-up strips and onto berm(?) at 70ish mph. 

I’ve been in several car accidents so idk if it’s some kind of PTSD or fight or flight response — but now I’m yelling, “OMG, I told U TO MERGE!!!!” 

This evolves into a screaming match with him turning up the radio as loud as possible. Lol.

For the record, I wasn’t trying to yell, but I did. I shouldn’t have, but it was like a —HOLY F THAT WAS ALMOST A BOATLOAD OF TRAUMA— response. I apologized later but he’s continuing to merge like an a-hole on the highway.

I had only met her a couple times before, but for some reason she became COMPLETELY obsessed with me (apparently some kind of person association problem) apparently she never stops talking about me, she would constantly write me extremely creepy letters. I had said that the situation made me very uncomfortable, but unfortunately, Ally’s mother and my mom’s friend thought it was cute and silly. 

        So fast forward about a month, and I’m going on a trip with my family. My mom’s friend gives us ride to the airport and she starts talking to me about Ally and she says that she has taken Ally to my work several times to see if I was there (luckily I guess I wasn’t working those days). I play it off with an awkward chuckle. I should also mention that my mom’s friend was house-sitting for us as well. What I didn’t know was that every time she would go to our house, she would bring Ally with. 

        We get home and what do ya know, Ally was in the living room. She freaks out when she sees me. She starts yelling to my and keeps trying touch me. Nobody tries to stop her or helps me. At this point I’m having a panic attack so I say I really have to use the bathroom and basically run to my room. When I opened the door, I nearly had a heart attack. My dresser was opened and some cloths were on the floor. I couldn’t believe it. SHE WENT THROUGH MY CLOTHS. I was livid. I ran downstairs into the living room where Ally and my mom’s friend were. Without even thinking I look at them and screamed. “YOU WENT THOUGH MY CLOTHS?!IVE SAID THAT THIS IS WIERD AND CREEPY AND MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT STOPS NOW!” Ally starts to freak out and cry while everyone starts yelling at me and tries to comfort Ally.

So I told her the truth, no sugarcoating. I told her that I love having her as a friend but I don’t think we would make good roommates. She asked why so I proceeded to say it’s because she’s a very messy person. She denied that she was so I responded, “every time I go to your house, it’s filthy and cluttered.

When my wife and I got married we agreed that we would have 2 kids unless both were girls, then we'd have a 3rd to try for a boy. I'm a guy's guy and I grew up with only brothers so I feel strongly that I want a son to bond with. That's not to say that I don't love my daughter equally. I just want to raise someone to follow in my footsteps with sports and girls and stuff. After some convincing, my wife agreed to this but said that if the 3rd kid was a girl, we'd stop trying. Anyway, we ended up having one boy (8 years old) and one girl (5 years old). This background is important because you need to know that having a 3rd kid was something that was on the table.

Last month, our son told us that he likes boys. This is totally fine, I'm not a homophobe, but I'm starting to feel like I want to have a 3rd kid so we can try to have a straight boy. I love my son more than anything and I wouldn't love a straight kid more than him, but at the end of the day I wanted to be able to bond with one of my kids over traditional masculine stuff, which includes women. 

My wife doesn't think that this is a good reason to have a 3rd kid. She said that she would be open to having a 3rd kid but that she finds my reasoning disgusting and she doesn't think she can go through with it knowing the reason for me wanting one.

I really thought they were a good match and she treated him really well. 2 months into his relationship with her, he calls me to tell me they broke up and he is back with his ex (the one that’s been on and off with him). I asked what happened and he said that him and his ex went to get drinks to catch up and went to her apartment together. Things started getting a little touchy and they were both in bed naked. His ex told him if he wanted her he had to call his gf and break up then and there. So my friend called his gf and broke up over the phone with her so he could have sex and be with his ex. He didn’t tell her why he broke up with her and just said it was because he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I found this absolutely awful and felt really bad for his girlfriend as she was great and such a genuinely sweet person. 2 days later his ex breaks up with him and says she’s not ready for another relationship with him.

I should mention that I (black) have really only been in relationships with white (older) men, except for one relationship with an Indian (older) guy. My “type” is obviously older but I made the comment that I do prefer to date someone of color compared to my other two relationships because it’s generally easier to talk about certain things/relate on certain levels. One friend didn’t mind since she has only dated white guys and one black guy and understood what I meant, while the other was confused since as long as she has known me it has pretty much been exclusively white guys outside of the one Indian guy (should mention that she dated exclusively within black guys) & also (in the sense of dating outside of a relationship/ it has still been exclusively white with two Indians). She said that by me not dating “within my type” it was rude since obviously I prefer someone of color but only end up seriously dating white guys. My question is, AITA for not dating closer to my “type”? I’ve thought about it more and she’s kinda right....... I do prefer the similarities that come with dating within color but also, I don’t mind dating who I end up dating if they’re just a better fit.		1	0

c3sqjy	2019-06-22 17:56:37	supremebessyl	WIBTA if I set up a password for my PS4 and hide my controllers	"I made a post about it not to long ago as a first, I have a nephew who would come over and play around, him and his family don't visit often and I have a PS4 in the living room since I was still waiting for a TV to be installed which stopped me from playing certain games due to how graphic they were. I care about my nephew, I'll call Batman (I don't like using actual names) and I are close, however he has never respected my boundaries and never asked to use any of my things.

Batman and his family came over to the house while over they ordered some food as we waited, I wasn't aware that Batman was with them until I my dad called me down to get pizza and there he was, Batman, sitting there, games all over the place, playing Spiderman on my PS4 without my permission nor knowledge. I was Furious, but I tried and kept my cool since the exact same thing has happened in the past more than once, I pulled over Batman's mom and told her why I don't want him playing and that I didn't appreciate how he didn't ask. She was nice enough to turn off the ps4 and hand over my controller, problem over, right?

This would've been the case, but it turns out that my dad has let Batman use my stuff without me knowing or asking me if I was okay about it, this has happened before with my relatives acting like they own my stuff and sharing them to my younger cousins and nephews without my knowledge, I was furious and my dad said that I should let him play or else he would take away the console and never let me have it again.

I was upset and grabbed the controllers and hid them in my room, this was the last straw for me and my boyfriend who knew about the situation said that I should lock up my account and only keep the password to myself so only I couldn't know, but I'm not sure, I made a post similar to this before of the exact same people of the exact same situation.

I absolutely appreciate them going out of their way to spend this money to celebrate me, but my dad has a very specific vision for what he wants and doesn’t take my opinion into consideration. From the start he said this was my party and thus my input was most important. However he picked the venue and set the menu without asking my opinion at all. Any suggestions I’ve had for decorations and party favors were rejected so we could go with what he wanted to do. I’m being forced to make a slideshow of childhood pictures of myself, but when I expressed that I don’t want a slideshow and that going through old photos is upsetting because I have issues with self image, he told me to make it anyway because it’ll seem weird if I don’t have one. In addition, I was extremely limited on the friends I could invite to my party so that my parents could invite as many people from the south Asian community as possible (my parents immigrated from Pakistan). This is honestly what upset me the most because I wanted to celebrate with my friends and classmates, not with a bunch of people I barely know. 

I expressed that it’s a little frustrating my opinion wasn’t being taken into account and now both of my parents are really upset with me. I told them I really appreciate that they’re putting so much money and effort into this for me, but they’re still saying I’m being ungrateful. It just feels like this has spiraled into something for my parents, not me.

Some background: I travel quite a lot (solo, and also for work) and my gf, due to low budget, doesn't. We don't live together: she's with housemates, I'm alone.


Sometimes I sublet my place when I'm gone.


Now, she has plans to have some friends over during the summer, from a different country; and she assumed it wouldn't be a big deal for me to stay over at her place for 2-3 nights so they could stay at my place.


My initial reaction was ""what?!"",  followed by ""maybe, but I need to think about it."" She got upset since for her it's not a big deal: she stays over at my place many times (understandably it's more comfortable), and she was sure it'll be easy for me.


We got into a fight over it, resolved (-ish) when we agree we've different perspectives on what is a small vs big favour.


We haven't figured out yet her friends' stay -- they think it's too expensive here to pay for lodging and were hoping to find an alternative way of staying, for free."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Now I am going to keep this short and stick to the facts. My Fiance (m32) and I (f29) live together in an apartment complex that has assigned parking. We both pay an equal amount of rent and in theory split the bills. We have a daughter 9 months who I primarily take care of and I just had our son he was premature born at 27 weeks via c-section. 

Here's the issue. He parks his car inside the gate. 9/10 I have to park outside. Parking outside is terrible. And hard with having the baby. So sometimes I park inside the gate next to his car. The space is big enough for two cars and I am not taking anything from someone else. 

Heres the question. AITA for wanting him to talk to the landlord about me being able to park inside the gate as well? Am I being unreasonable, my thinking is we both equally pay rent so we should both equally benefit from the amenities.

Edit. Most couples have two spaces in the complex. The lease states you may have two spaces. This is based on availability.

Edit. Our second child is still in the NICU. I brought tht up because I had a c-section and it's harder for me to walk long distances right now since I had our baby 5 weeks ago.

Edit. There are spaces available. I am an occupant not financially responsible so I can't request or fill the paperwork out. I'm more than willing to pay the fee fit the extra space."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3sp20	2019-06-22 17:53:07	crystudent	AITA For not wanting to go to the sea with my family?	"Hi, sorry for the English, I could come across as a spoiled child, but please hear me out.

So since we were little every summer we go to the sea at the end of the weekend (Saturday,Sunday and Monday).

We have a house there that was given to us by our grandparents.

So I’ve always hated going to the sea since we were little, but I’ve always endured it.

I’ve always told them why I didn’t like it.

I don’t have any friends since I’m a shy person myself and I find it hard to just go to a group and start a conversation.

I hate the beach (I’m more of a mountain person). So I don’t have anything to do there and I always end up staying home drawing.

And because of that we always end up fighting about it because they want me to go to the beach with them.

The fact is that if I go with them I still won’t do anything since they sleep all afternoon.

I can’t do anything with my brother either since he has a lot of friends there and he goes away all day.

I would prefer staying home and going out with my friends there or at the pool with them.

Before you said they want “family time”, they always told me that these little trips are for them, for resting from work, and not for us.

I’ve proposed that I could stay home alone so they get to enjoy the beach without me nagging them and I’ll be happy too since I get to go out with my friends.

But they refused saying I’m a minor and if something happens it’s their responsibility. I’m 17 F so I think I can be by myself for a few day.

I’m just tired to go there and fight about the same things.

They’re doing party games like bubble soccer etc. I get done work at 5 and she gets done work at 7 but we both work in a kitchen so it’s not 100% she’ll be done right at 7. Plus she tends to take a long time to get ready. Usually if I say I want to leave at 9 she’ll be ready to leave by 10. I told her that I was going to go there and not start drinking until she calls me and is ready to be picked up, and then I would leave and grab her and go back to the party(only 10 mins from her house) She’s saying that she will be ready at 705 and to just wait at home for her when in reality she will likely be ready by 730 or later. They are doing a series of games and I don’t want to miss out on some of them. She wants me to just wait at home for her but I don’t see what the big deal is if she is going to get to the party at the same time regardless if I go before or not. Am I the asshole?		1	0

We have tons in common and know the same people which is great except I can't tell if she's a real friend or not. The first time we hung out after reconnecting was MDW (end of May). I invited her to go to the beach and she declined saying she had things to do for school, I'm in the same program as her and classes hadn't even started yet so I had this strange expression my face. She realizes that her excuse is BS and quickly says that she was think of something else. After our day at the beach she told me she had sooo much fun and that she wants to go every other week, BUT she isn't good with initiating plans so I have to initiate and she'll except (not her exact words). I don't think much of it since she is a bit of an insecure person and had ""trust issues"".

A week later I invite her out to the city and we have a good time, (I saw her mom after and she was telling me how happy she was when she got home). When we were in the city, I tell her that next time she should initiate and she says she basically never leaves her house which I took to mean that she won't. I know her schedule, she doesn't work at all and she's only taking 2 classes at a time for her mba. I'm ahead of her in this grad school program but I'm 1.5 years younger than her so I know the effort and material that she's doing.

c3sofk	2019-06-22 17:51:38	usnymomthrow	AITA for talking to my ex's girlfriend about his illness?	"A few years ago I asked my ex husband for a divorce and we went our separate ways. We have 2 small boys together (3 and 5) and live an hour and a half apart and things have always been very tense between us. Out of the blue he told me a few months back that he was seeing someone. I didn't think it was going to go anywhere, but then our older son after a while started coming home from their time at my ex's and would not stop talking about her and her son who happens to be his age. I started paying attention to social media and though her and my ex each only post pictures of their own kid it's obvious that they go and do everything together on weekends and frequently get together for dinner at her place or my ex in laws (he is living back at home after the divorce) on weeknights. After a while my son started complaining to me that he was bored being at home, telling me he missed Robby and so forth. 

I told Dan that him and Rose needed to cool it on the excessive weekend activities and not have the kids spend so much time together because it was making our son act out and alienating him from me. This is where things between Rose and I went bad.. up until that point she was friendly with me but definitely became a little colder after I made that request. Dan ignored me which was upsetting and obviously did nothing but make the problem with our son worse, so I reached out to her on Facebook messenger and she told me she didn't want to be involved in any disagreements about the kids. 

I told her that because Dan has Asperger's he doesn't always make the right decisions about the kids which was why I was talking to her about it and she went from being cold to downright rude. She said I didn't have any right to tell her or anyone else about him having Asperger's and called me some pretty nasty things (like that I was ignorant, and she accused me of trying to manipulate them both) and then blocked me. She told Dan about it and he was very upset by the whole thing which strained our parenting further and now wants us to use an App where everything also gets sent to the court . His family has basically stopped talking to me and completely cut me off of social media and a few of our friends said that telling her was wrong or not checking with Dan first. 

In MY opinion it would have been way worse if she hadn't been told and made aware, and you'd think being a mother with her own child to look out for she would have appreciated me giving her the heads up. Part of me thinks this overreaction is just immature retaliation on their part because I tried to get our custody agreement changed due a DWAI she got a few years ago. So am I really the asshole for simply stating what my ex husband has to his girlfriend?

c3sn0o	2019-06-22 17:48:11		AITA for being honest with my best friend?	"This is gonna be a long one, I’m on mobile so excuse any errors please. 

I’ve known my friend since we were 10 years old, we are now both in our 30’s. She’s more like a sister than a friend, I thought anyways. 

In her mid twenties she had a drastic change of character. She met a well off guy who spoiled her financially. When they broke up, she tried to hold on to that lifestyle but couldn’t because she didn’t finish her high school education and could only get minimum paid jobs. 

She took up make up as a hobby and decided she wants to be a YouTuber/instagrammer. She eventually took up some classes but never got board certified and depended on social media for work. We live in a huge city where everyone is trying to be an influencer/actor/make up artist, etc etc. 

I supported her decisions but always told her she should at least have a part time job to support to side gig as it wasn’t really bringing in any money. She couldn’t keep a job for the life of her. She was let go by her own sister because she simply wouldn’t show up to work when she didn’t want to. She got a job at a department store which I thought was great because she can grow within the company, have benefits, etc while focusing on her other career. Of course, she quit that job too because she simply didn’t like the job. 

Now I honestly don’t care if she wants to work or not BUT she became a leech! She was crashing on my sofa 24/7, moping around about her life and just became what I consider, toxic. I would make us dinner, clean up after her, I felt like I had a wife that I didn’t want! 
I should’ve spoken up sooner but felt bad for her and just kept it to myself (not smart, I know).

Now here’s where it gets complicated..
Her sister and I became friends during this time, we’ve always known each other but never really hung out. And a lot of things come to light. She would tell her sister how I never supported her, and she told me the same about her sister. Pretty much, she thinks she’s all alone with no help. I realized during the conversations I had with her sister how messed up she really is. She’s had trauma in the past but treating people like this is not excusable. 

She decided to up and leave the country with her boyfriend she met online. She asks for my advice on the situation and I told her straight up, “you need to figure sh*t out because you’re broke, jobless and depend on others to take care of you.” She lost it and cut off communication with me because I’m not a good friend. I know we can be harsh with each other sometimes but I never thought of myself as a bad friend. My thing is, don’t ask me for advice if you want me to lie to you. I can’t and won’t do that. I’ve been raised to be honest, especially with people you care about. 

So guys, AITA for telling her how I feel about her decisions?

c3smht	2019-06-22 17:47:01	cointoss27	WIBTA if I left my family due to disagreements over life choices?	"Throwaway, long read but please bear with me.

After getting my media diploma, then serving my national service, I got a job as a videographer at 22. It’s almost a year since I started, and while the hours are long, I love my work, my colleagues are like a second family to me and pay is decent. 

My family on the other hand, want me to go to university. Where I come from, many people are expected to go to uni. Even though the trend is shifting, there are some traditional minded people who stick by this, and my family happen to be some of them. In fact, they only let me work for a year after I promised that I would head back to university when I felt I was ready. Thing is, getting into a uni media course is pretty tough here for some reason. I have tried for two years during national service to get in and failed. I have no interest in the other courses because they are unrelated to what I want, but my parents want me to get a uni degree just for the sake of it. I see no reason in wasting time and money for something that I have no interest in just for a degree that I would never use.

In my line of work, degrees are not prioritized, but rather the quality of your work and experience. I have talked to peers who have worked in this industry and they do agree that while degrees are helpful, they pointed out that they aren’t necessary(from what I heard), in fact some of them had unrelated degrees and realized they just wasted their time in uni.

I tried my best to reason with my parents that uni wasn’t cut out for me, that I loved my job and my colleagues, and I’m not throwing everything I built up on their whim. Their response was “you promised OP”, and “I’m right you’re wrong!”, despite my attempts. We quickly argue when the topic is brought up because they act rather stubborn and literally refuse to listen. I also find it disgusting that they care more about a ‘promise’ rather than the happiness of their son.

I applied this year for their sake, hoping for a chance of getting the course I wanted, but instead got something else. My parents, hearing that I still got into uni anyways, started talking about preparations. This angered me as they never bothered to ask me much about work, but never hesitated to ask me about uni preparations. They never gave encouragement or consolation that I have to give up everything I worked for. They would never be convinced. While I have a uni place, no fees have been paid yet and I am still allowed to reject it.

So I have started making preparations to move out on the sly, but I am hesitant to go ahead. They are my parents after all. While I will leave a message that I have left and am perfectly safe, I dont intend to contact them for some time and my sudden departure will cause a big upheaval. I strongly feel that I, not them, should decide what to do in my life, but I cannot bear to hurt them like this.

Not sure how long before we got into a relationship, but she was cutting excessively and she hasn’t cut in 1 1/2 years now. She didn’t get help for it until we got into a relationship and I confronted her parents about it.

Since then we’ve gotten a lot of medicated and therapeutic help but during that period of time she decided she would attempt to graduate early.

Her parents payed for it but she never made an attempt to work on it- saying that it “stressed her out too much” and she stopped going to school for a while after she got behind. Any time me/her parents tried to have a serious discussion about it she would say we didn’t care about how she felt.

She never ended up getting it done and she also nearly missed a quarter of the year attendance-wise.

This next year her parents have moved her into more forgiving classes and she says she is planning on working part time while attending.

I decided to tell her today that she wouldn’t be capable of that. I told her that someone needed to say it and that an extra 50$ a week wouldn’t make her any happier. (She wants to work so she can buy more makeup and clothes, her exact words)

She gets an allowance of 10$ every week and I frequently loan her money to help her buy game currency purchases, clothes and takeout food.

She’s very upset with me after I said that and says it was very demoralizing to hear that from me.

I'm a hard core vegetarian. Not even egg. She knows this.

Not that I have a problem with other people eating non vegetarian food around me. I am okay with other people around having non vegetarian food around me.

Suddenly, while having the shawarma roll, she asks me for my phone. I being my normal self that I can't give it to her unless she would sanitize her hands.

She flips over and says I am calling her out and calling her untouchable since I don't like vegetarian food, taunting her and treating her badly because she is having non vegetarian food and I am serving her a formality by waiting for her to finish before we head home.

Am I the asshole here if I am not comfortable with someone touching my stuff while they are having non vegetarian food or is that really insensitive of me. I don't think I hurt anyone, since I would respond the same way with anyone else.

So my mom is throwing her boyfriend a surprise birthday party on the 11th of August. I’ve already posted on r/raisedbynarcissists about her behavior there. Now I don’t want to go to his party. 

1: We don’t get along. Since he accused me of stealing his car keys and planting his sons papers in my room. I’ve already posted the entire story on “My Mom’s Perfect Boyfriend and His Son” for context. And then when he found it was his son, he never apologized to me. He avoids me all together. 

2: He’s going to be eating a restaurant that I despise. Their food has never been good and the last time I went there with family, they didn’t even bring me my food. After I told them that, they never apologized or offered to compensate. We argued with them but we’re forced to pay for a meal we didn’t even get. Mom knows this. She was there. 

3: His entire family is going to be there and asks questions. What am I supposed to say when they ask if I’m getting along with them? I’m a horrible liar. I stutter like crazy and can’t look people in the eyes. If I tell them truth, Mom will yell at me and might even try to hit me. And if I avoid them all together (which would be hard to do at a restaurant and mom doesn’t like it when I’m on the phone) they’ll get suspicious and Mom will be upset. 

She wants me to get to know his family. But I feel like that will end up backfiring. I’m not good with people. And I don’t want to get to know them. I’m scared I’ll say the wrong thing and get yelled at. That’s why I avoid them if they ever come over. Mom says it’s because I’m shy.

"First of all, this is all just happening in an obscure but still semi popular MMORPG video game and I should get a better hobby but this situation has left me confused and wondering about my own morals as a person.

&#x200B;

Me (19 F) met a guy (25 M) who happened to live in the same country as me through a game. I'll be calling the guy S for story telling conveniences. S suggested that we both make new game characters with matching names and join the same guild, be the same level, and had them married. I agreed since I was looking to have a new character with a friend anyway. Fast forward a few weeks later, I was busy with college so I gave S my matching account's password to log into if he needed to use it when I couldn't be on. S started being nicer towards me than usual and charged some game cash on my account (about 30 dollars), gifted me some premium items and asked me to pay for half an armor set with some in game currency, which I did too. However, I've never asked him to give me anything, it was all done in his own free will and he hasn't told me before he was going to give me something. He's always just had it gifted or bought something to my character without telling me beforehand. This just results in me going, oh haha, I appreciate it thank you but I didn't expect it.

&#x200B;

Now here comes the big issue. After not speaking to him for about 1 week or so due to final submissions for college (he knew that, I gave him a heads up), I logged in the account I shared with him to find out the armor set I paid half for was gone and my gifts were taken away. I was confused and messaged S, only to find out he had blocked me on all platforms. I was bewildered and told people in guild chat that he logged on my account to take back the items and that he blocked me everywhere and it felt bad as I had no idea what happened. Guild master then kicked him out. When S came back to find himself kicked, he was very angry. He took it upon the shout system (a cash item where everyone online can see what you write) to curse me out for being a golddigger, him taking back the items was justified since they were originally gifts to me and I was victimising myself because I didn't own what he gave me from the start. I did pay for half my armor that he took back though. I tried to pm in the game but he just kept saying how he had his reasons for cutting me off and that if I cared so much I would've contacted a third party to contact him about why he did it. This made me angry, because I didn't know any mutuals that I could've possibly contacted, plus I wanted to resolve it privately but he had me blocked on all social media sites, like what was I supposed to do? I told him that and all he said was ""blocked. You messed up.""

&#x200B;

AITA for considering the gifts he's given me as mine and for considering him logging on my account to take back the gifts without telling me and blocking as an untrustworthy and scamming action? Also, would I be considered an entitled golddigger in this case?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My MIL, BIL, and SO are out of the country for various things. My SO this morning texted me that his brother got into a very minor motorcycle related accident. SO and BIL don’t seem very worried but told me specifically not to tell their mother. MIL gets very worried and protective of both of them and there wouldn’t be anything she can do but I personally think she should know in case it gets worse and just in general because I don’t like being dishonest and it just doesn’t sit right with me to keep this from her.

c3sbo9	2019-06-22 17:21:41	balletthrowaway1	WIBTA if I have a popular youtuber friend of mine make a video to help me find the girl I bullied in high school so I can apologise and make sure she's okay?	"I'll make this short, also writing this while heavily sleep deprived so I hope this will make sense.

Some background info. In high school, I bullied the sweetest shy girl simply because she was different from my friends and I. After living in denial repressing the severity of my acts for years, I was faced with how much affect they must have had on this poor girl... I want to apologise to her, as well as make sure she's alive and well since we pushed her into a very dark place back then. I hope to be able to help if she needs it. I began looking for her about three months ago, but it's proven to be an impossible task since she doesn't have any social media accounts under her name, I haven't the slightest clue where she lives, studies or works or if she's perhaps gotten married and changed her last name or something similar. I've tried desperate things from searching through all kinds of records to calling offices - of which many thought I was crazy. A post I made here on Reddit three months ago remains fruitless as well despite the help I've gotten, I'm still grateful for that.

To the issue. A friend of mine is a youtuber with a sizeable following and active fan base. We caught up after a few months of silence and I brought this situation of mine into the light just to vent, I elaborated how desperate I really am, I'm out of options with no idea on what to do next. My friend then suggested that she'd make a video about it all. We wouldn't give away anything sensitive about this girl, only the necessary bits and pieces so her friends and acquaintances could recognize her along with a short summary of the situation and how it's crucial we find her to make sure she's okay. We weren't planning on going to more detail than this: Her nickname is Lulu, she attended an art school where she majored in ballet. She has blonde hair, blue eyes and a high pitched voice. She used to crochet a lot so perhaps that's still one of her hobbies. Just enough to give people an idea if they happen to share a school/workplace/friend group with her.

My initial reaction was a big fat yes and we started planning all this - the sooner we get the video out there, the better. But upon talking about the details, I came to think that it might make Lulu uncomfortable - she never liked attention, she might not want for anything to be public. But it's not like I'm compromising her privacy by giving away her real name, nationality, the school we attended etc? She never used social media as far as I know, so I doubt anyone could tie any strings to her unless they knew her personally?

I literally can't sleep anymore because of this, I'm an emotional wreck. I absolutely must find her or hear what happened to her. She deserves nothing but the best, she's the sweetest girl and I only want to make everything up to her if I at all can.

So will I be the asshole?

Edit - I'm the asshole. Thank you for your feedback. I've told my friend we're not making the video and I look to keep this out of the public eye."	Asshole	0	0

c3sbcm	2019-06-22 17:20:46		AITA for taking prescription painkillers after surgery even though I’ve been in recovery for three years	My girlfriend and I had been discussing how my wisdom teeth surgery would go about because it needed to be done. I told her I was going to have IV anesthesia and take the medicine the doctors gives me as prescribed. She also had this procedure done and she is also in recovery. She chose to tell the doctor she was in recovery and have the procedure done with no drugs and ibuprofen to follow up be cause she feared of relapsing and breaking her sobriety. I felt like I could handle this and I assured her that it would be fine and she decided to drop it. 2 days later before the surgery she brought the topic back up again and said it affects her sobriety because we live together and she is terrified to relapse and she wants me to ya e a plan. I told her I would hide the painkillers and take them as prescribed. She then said that she had a lightbulb moment and that she was maki g it about herself and said she would drop it. So I have the surgery and am out of work for 2 days on oxycodone at home. 3 days after the surgery I have returned to work and am almost finished with the pain killers. When I get home, she is upset about the medicine again, tells me she doesn’t like taking them and that she has a right to feel the way she does. I acknowledge that, but I get frustrated because she keeps stirring the pot on this subject and says, you don’t have to do anything just acknowledge the way I feel. This turns into a huge arguement with both of us going to bed angry and arguing with each other on the phone this morning. The painkillers are gone. I don’t want more and i still feel strong in my recovery. Am I the asshole?		1	0

c3s6kw	2019-06-22 17:09:10	RangerBTW	AITA for making my cousin question if she’s adopted?	"I (21m) was hanging out with my cousin (7f). She asked how many siblings I had and I said 1 sister and 1 adopted brother, where my brothers is my dog. It’s been a long running joke in my family that my dog is an adopted kid bc of how we treat him. We can’t be the only family...

Anyway, she started making fun of my dog which kind of upset me since I don’t see what’s wrong with being adopted. My mindset is that love is love and you don’t need to have the same blood to be family. So I asked her what if she’s adopted? She said she’s not because she had baby pictures to which I responded that how can you be sure that that’s you as a baby? I didn’t mean anything negative about it, I just wanted to make her question things and figure out what to believe instead of believing everything she hears. 

Once I said that she made a face of terror and ran away to her parents. I haven’t seen her since but my mom said I was TA for saying that. I was expecting to have a conversation with my cousin. If she gave me the time I would’ve reassured her that she’s not adopted but also make her see that there isn’t anything wrong with being adopted. 

As it stand I feel bad for what I said but I think it could’ve been a good opportunity for her to see different perspectives. So let me know what you think. Is she too young for this kind of conversation? Is that just a topic that I shouldn’t ever mention?

Edit: Forgot to mention that when I asked my sis and her boyfriend about the situation. They said I wasn’t TA  since she’s a bit spoiled (which she is) and can stand to not get everything her way

Edit 2: Its not about her making fun of my dog that ticked me the wrong way. It was the fact that she was using being adopted as a bad way. I pictured her acting that way to another kid and thought it wasn’t right but from what I’m reading I definitely handled it the wrong way. As I feared she’s too young. I’ll apologize to her when I see her again and explain that I was kidding and there’s nothing to worry about.

Final Edit: As I do feel horrible about this whole situation I wanted to update for those who are invested. I talked to her parents and she’s not traumatized or hurt about it. She just got frustrated with me bc I didn’t accept that her parents were biological and got bored so she dipped. I’ll still talk to her but I’m glad to know she didn’t cry or get too upset since it wasn’t my intention"	Asshole	0	0

c3s1nu	2019-06-22 16:58:04	0Peachtree0	AITA for reporting one co-worker for homophobic comments but not the other?	"Hi reddit, 
I’ve been working at the same store ( small team, 3-5 workers) for over 3 years and one of my new co-worker has been hard to work with. I never had a problem with a co-worker but I feel I won’t last the summer with him. He makes generalising statements about everyone and everything and he’s always right, trying to have a discussion is like speaking to a wall... An exemple of this would be when I was speaking to another co-worker about my ex-girlfriend and the fact that I date girls who tend to be chubbier. He exclamed I must be doing this because “fat girls are easier”. Told him very seriously to stop talking shit about stuff he knows nothing about( called my ex easy?!? Wtf?!?) and he kept going “ You could get hotter chicks you just need to be confident”. Like I said, talking to a wall. 

One of his many statements is that bisexuality doesn’t exist and its simply teenagers rebelling againt whatever. I am a bisexual man but few people know about it, never wanted to deal with everyone's reaction. So after a few of these annoying conversation I went to my boss and told her I can’t keep working with him and she asked for a list of things he has said to make an official report. Most of the things he has said would probably resort in a warning but I feel the homophobia alone would make it much easier to fire him. 

My conflict is that another of the employee is also somewhat homophobic and makes regular comments but i’ve never had a problem with it because it always seemed somewhat innocent. Like a childish disgust over 2 men together. Apart from that he is incredibly respectful and sort of a mentor to me since i’ve been working with him. 

So my dillema is that I’ve reported one type of homophobia but not the other. It makes sense to me since one is a juvenile disgust which seems to come from his background (underground rap) more than an ideologie, like he’s never been confronted with a person close to him being gay. The other one seems like an outright rejection of someone's sexuality, like those people thinking you can “pray the gay away”...

 I’ve been thinking about this and feel its hypocritical to report one and not the other. So, am I the asshole?  

PS :This is my first reddit post so sorry if the formating is weird :/

Edit: re-reading my post I just want to make something clear. I didnt make a complaint to talk about the homophobia, it just came out during the meeting. Later I realised it sounded hypocritical to let it slide for 3 year but complain about it when the new guy does it. Didnt want him to be fired, just to not be put on shift with him."

There’s a really cool limited edition gameboy color that someone is selling around me and it’s double the price from the one I got for my boyfriend.

Recently we went to a small concert, just a local band with a small cover fee. My buddy is hard up on cash and I offered to cover him. He shows up with his girlfriend and acts all offended when I don’t pay for her too.

I’ve even said “hey let’s do this thing, make it a bros night”. Hoping he’d catch the hint that I don’t want to feel like the awkward third wheel all the time. He never does though. He and Kate frequently end up endlessly referencing events that just happened to them two when we’re chilling. So it makes me feel even more left out.

Emotionally/physically abusive sometimes although physically stopped when I was eighteen and threatened to call cops if she ever did touch me again. From there the emotional section just got way worse. Basically her verbal punching bag for when she’s angry. It’s odd but I see through her, I know what her childhood was like and therefore mostly know why she’s such a narcissist like this, it sucks the life out of me- but i know the place it comes from. Gave me lots of anxiety and occasional depression (i’m pretty sure seasonal but idk i need a therapist honestly).

Anyways, besides all that stuff, I got a job last week! It is the perfect job for me as it is at a daycare with the title of assistant teacher! I’m majoring in special education and english at college and so coming out of college with assist teacher on my resume shows that I have loads of experience starting as early as my sophomore year. Not to mention the fact that it’s a minute walk from my house. It’s almost too good to be true. I fill out the online application I found and get a call for an interview. I told my mom excitedly and she seems happy but then goes “I almost applied there years ago”. Okay, didn’t think much about it. Interview goes swimmingly and I get the job at this point literally crying happy tears cause I really thought my anxiety would get in my way on this one. 

Like two days before I start the job i’m talking with my dad about all the forms, and my mom comes and looks at this training paper, takes a picture, and is like “perfect! Now I can get a job there too like I wanted years ago” My first reaction- “Why on earth would you do that...” 
I know that seems very rude- but read the first paragraph again. We can’t even function as mother daughter- she would be a lead teacher and I would be working FOR her.

"A bit of background:  I am friends with two women.  We went to high school together and one of the women I have known since sixth grade (she was even one of my bridesmaids when I got married).  I will call this friend G.  The other friend I will call F.  F and I had many classes together in high school and played a lot of the same sports.  Since high school - and my wedding - we have kept in touch on and off throughout the years.  This year, there seems to have been a resurgence of sorts in our friendship, and we have been getting together at least once a month for lunch or dinner.  One thing that the three of us have in common is our love of theater, musicals, and Broadway.  Every time we get together, we’re always saying to each other, “We should get tickets to this such and such show”, “Let me know what new shows are coming to this theater”, etc., etc.  Welcome to the life of a forty-something.  😉

We got together for dinner last night, and it was fun.  We had a few laughs, discussed our plans for the summer, and - of course - talked about musicals.  About an hour after I got home last night, I received a message (the three of us have a seemingly never-ending group message going on) from friend F.  She thanked us for a nice evening, and wrote that she was looking forward to getting together again.  I wrote back that I had a nice time as well, and maybe next time we could actually find a show to go to together, even if it is a local, community theater production.  I went to bed after that.  

This morning, I woke up to a message (in response to my “let’s see a show next time”) from friend F:  “G and I are going to see a local musical on Sunday.”  I was instantly stunned and hurt, and immediately thought to myself, “Why wasn’t I included/invited?”  Instead of confronting/asking anything, I just wrote back, “That’s great!  Have fun.”  I saw that friend G (the have-known-since-sixth-grade/former bridesmaid friend) had read the messages, but she didn’t respond.  

Right now, I am just perplexed and hurt as to why I wasn’t included or even told about it.  WIBTA if I sent a group message expressing my puzzlement and hurt, or should I just move on and let it go?  This is all making me feel that perhaps they just don’t enjoy my company.  Thanks."		1	0

She and my husband kept after me for about a year and I finally gave in with the stipulation that they would have to take care of the dog and they eagerly agreed.  Fast forward 2 years after getting the dog, they've been pretty good about taking care of her.  I actually will occasionally will take her on a walk when they both get busy and don't take her out enough.  Well this summer my husband  and daughter are going out of town at the same time for 4 days.  I asked my husband who was going to take care of the dog and he said I was, of course.  Well, I've been dealing with a lot of mental and physical issues lately and I don't feel like I can handle it.  Part of the problem is this dog can be aggressive so I have to deal with it barking and lunging at people and animals when I walk her.  His reasoning is he has taken care of our other dog two times in the past 6 years when I went out of town but she is only 7 pounds and can get away with not being walked (we have a backyard) and when we got her he never said I needed to be the only one to take care of her.  AITA for being honest about my inability to take care of ""their"" dog?

Edit: We also have guests with a 9 year old coming from out of town during this time and I would constantly have to police the dog on my own, which I am also feeling overwhelmed about

So today my parents came up to me and my little brother (I'm 13 he's 8) and told us that they are going to different places tonight, my mom's is going to her friends daughters 8th birthday party and my dad is going with his friends to their house. She couldn't find a sitter so I was to go with my dad while my brother went w/ my mom. I was disappointed as there would be kids my age at that kids party, but instead I would be stuck in a room while a bunch of 40 yr olds smoked. Later, I was in my room when my parents came and told me that I'm actually going to a cottage with my dad and not a house and that we would be swimming, bowling, etc. They told me not to tell my little brother as he would become sad and want to go. My parents say it makes more sense since I'm more mature, but I feel like a jerk. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

c3rrs2	2019-06-22 16:35:30	AshleyCakeGamin	AITA for breaking $300 keys after my mom told me to throw them?	"For little story I have the ability to write with both left and right hand and I also play softball. So when I throw something I'm throwing something. The word 'tossing' is not in my vocabulary. And I was about to go out with some family so I just got another shower and was in a towel.

So not too long ago today my mom call me and told me to bring down some keys for the rental car. Now this was a really nice car that her dealership let her use while her car was being fixed since it got into a really bad accident, I can't tell you what car it is since I'm not really good with those but it's expensive and the keys are just as.

So since I'm in a towel and she understands I'm in a towel she tells me just to throw the kids down the stairs. We live in an apartment house that looks and is like a house but for 2 and a half families (Basically all three entrances to all three apartments are outside) on the second floor so on the side of the house there's at least 20 or 12 steps and she was telling me to throw the keys down to her since I can't go outside in a towel.

Exact words:

Mum: Hurry and throw them so you can get dressed

Me: You want me to throw the keys?

Mum: Yeah, come on

Me being her kid and her being my mom I trust her judgment and did as I was told. I threw the keys. I throw the keys right at her cupped hands.

Since softball at school stopped in May and summer just started so I haven't been practicing softball so for a month and a few days I'm thinking about my arms have gotten weak especially since I haven't done anything but lay around, eat chips, and play video games. Like I've been so lazy my room is starting to look like a somewhat organized neckbeard nest.

So not considering how hard I was throwing or the fact that these keys are hecka expensive I threw her the keys believing I was giving her a light easy catch but in reality was launching a missile.

Because the keys were moving downward it picked up more speed and she had to dodge.

I watched in horror as the key broke in two on the concrete. What's the second of hesitation my mom instantly got on me only how I shouldn't has thrown them and how she said to just come downstairs.

I was basically frozen in place as she lectured me and continue to tell me that they were $300 and I was an idiot for throwing them down to her knowing I can't throw.

I was ready to take the blame as I saw it was my fault until she told me I couldn't throw and that she told me to do the opposite of what I just did.

I take offence to people saying I can throw especially since she's been to games where I pitched and been told I did great, I get that she's the mother and I need to be lectured and told off for doing something stupid but insulting me isn't it.

Especially since she's the one who came up with the stupid idea.

And even though the store derailed off the track a little bit I need to know who in the situation is the antagonist.

Edit: There's a roof above the stairs. If I were to throw an underhand it would hit the roof because it would've went up.

Edit: Okie dokie, okay I understand I was in the wrong. I post looking for people on my side but I'm starting to understand that I was being childish, my mother was able to fix it so none of this really matters and I apologized. Thank to everyone who was actually be civil and I get the picture for the ones who weren't. Also chill I'm not even 17."	Asshole	0	0

c3rq1z	2019-06-22 16:31:44	aldermoth	AITA for yelling at my dad?	"Ok, so, it's summer. Whee. I'm a highschooler. I have really bad insomnia due to a mix of depression, anxiety, and autism (all professionally diagnosed). I have sleep medicine but when I get the option to stay up late over breaks, I naturally just stay up later and later until I'm going to bed at 6 AM and waking up at 4 PM. I generally dont see it as a problem, as I'm still getting ten hours of sleep every night (day?). But we're not here to debate whether its healthy, because I know it's not. Well, like usual, I go to bed at 6 AM last night and wake up at 8 AM to my dad telling me he's locking the dogs in my room because the AT&T guy is over. I'm inwardly pissed but I don't say anything yet because we have two pitbulls and only a pitbull owner wouldn't turn tail and run at the sight of them. Like usual, the dogs start clawing at the door and whining loudly, and one of them gives that up and starts climbing all over me and whining at me for attention. Adorable, but I'm unable to sleep because of this. I eventually get dad's attention and tell him to get the dogs the hell out of my room, and he does. Okay. I try to go back to sleep, but it's pretty rough. Just when I actually start to fall asleep three hours later, Dad comes into my room and wakes me up to show me how fast our new wifi is that AT&T just installed. Jesus christ, I don't care. I already told you I went to bed at 6 AM and I'm trying to sleep. I tried not to yell at him for the dogs since I understood why he needed to do that, but theres literally no reason to wake me up to show me how fast our wifi is now. I would have seen myself when I woke up. So, I yell at him because now I just straight up can't sleep. I'm probably going to fall asleep at 3 or 4 PM and fuck up my schedule even further now. I've been trying to avoid what happened last summer (Sleep at 1 PM and wake up at 1 AM). He gets mad and starts randomly going off on me for some dishes I left out last night, which is what usually happens; I get mad at him for doing something, and he defends himself by using something I did instead of owning up to what he did. I love him for taking me in when I needed to get away from my abusive mom, but sometimes he acts like her and it really stresses me out. I know he isn't abusive, but he sometimes doesnt know what the hell hes doing.

Edit: Thank you guys for your judgement. I'm going to apologize to my dad now

c3rkkg	2019-06-22 16:18:50		AITA for letting my kid run around a restaurant?	"I've started wondering if we're the assholes when we go out to eat with our almost-2yo.

A few notes:

-we go out during the day, 5pm max, so it's never even close to bedtime crankiness

 - screaming/crying is an immediate removal to go outside and evaluate if we're just going to pay and head out, or if it's a one off


But I do let her walk/toddler-run around if it's not crowded and I follow her to make sure she's not running into any crowded areas, areas she shouldn't be in, or generally bothering anyone in particular (which she hasn't ever done but who knows). At worst she giggles; again, any screaming, and we go outside. 


This happens only when all other methods of sitting at the seat failed and we're trying to finish eating. But that's about 40% of the time we go out to eat, which isn't really often in general. We go to not fancy, but not fast food, kinds of places. 

I've never noticed a dirty look (and I do look around), and no one ever said anything. Most people smile briefly, others ignore it entirely.

c3ri6h	2019-06-22 16:13:27	nelard84	AITA for chewing out someone using food stamps?	"TL:DR at the end

So I live in NYC where prices can be expensive, especially at the grocery store. I make a decent living, but still like to shop sales and discounts. If there’s a good sale on non-perishables or things I can freeze, I stock up. As an example, and will reference again later, bone-in pork chops were on sale one week for $2.29/lb, so I bought 3 packages. The next week, the price was jacked up to $5.19/lb.

So I’m doing my normal grocery shopping, pick up sale items, and get in line behind some woman. I take notice of some of her groceries. She’s got 2 packages of the $5.19/lb pork chops (sale price was the week before), and other expensive items, like two 8 oz. sticks of sharp white cheddar cheese, Crackel Barrel brand ($7.99 each). I had the identical product, but McCadam brand (on sale 2 for $5).

After she gets her total, whips out an EBT card and swipes it. When the options on the pin pad come up to choose credit/debit/EBT, she chooses credit. Card declined. Twice. 3 times. I see what’s happening and it’s aggravating me as she is clearly trying to game the system and could point out her error, but keep to myself. On the 5th attempt, the cashier watches her and points out she needs to choose EBT.

She doesn’t have the funds to pay for all her groceries, short roughly $10.00. Starts mumbling to herself about how expensive food is, yadda yadda, before turning to me and asking if I can help her out by sparing the change she needs to pay for her groceries because she can’t afford them.

I lose it on her and start bitching her out about how she’s a drain on the welfare system. I kept my words fairly clean, no f-bombs, no See You Next Tuesday’s, but you could sharpen a knife on how hard my tone was. Two things I distinctly remember saying were “boy price must really have no meaning when you’re spending other people’s money” and “you’re being too stupid to look at prices when shopping is not my problem.”

I pointed out she was paying $16 for an identical product I had, which was $5, enough to cover her shortfall and offered to switch. She declined, stared at me blankly, then opened her purse and took out enough cash to pay the balance and left.

AITA for calling her out? I feel like no because I kept the language fairly clean, it was just a harsh tone calling her out on her BS.

TL:DR: Lady in the grocery store buys expensive ass food with EBT, tried to cheat the system when prompted for payment, asked me to cover her shortfall when she actually had the funds to pay for herself, and declined my offer to swap for identical and cheaper items I had.

EDIT:
After reading some replies, I want to add that this happened a while ago, and I've been racking my brain as to what exactly my monologue was, and I think my initial phrasing that I called her a drain on society was a very very poor way of describing my triad. 

I wasn't attacking her as a person on welfare, it was really more calling her out on buying expensive food with food stamps, complaining, and then begging for money. I've put way too much brain power behind this, but here is what I believe I said (definitely not word for word exact, but it is the entire monologue and point I conveyed) after she asked me for money:

(hard & stern tone): ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You've got some of the most expensive items in the store, you're buying them with food stamps, and your asking me for money?!?! Those pork chops were $2.29/pound last week, yet you're buying them now for $5.19?? And those Cracker Barrels are $8 a stick. I've got the exact same thing, 2 for $5."" 
(calmer tone). ""Look. I'll trade with you. I'll take the Cracker Barrel, you take the McCadam. They're the exact same product, 2 8 oz. sticks of sharp white cheddar cheese. The savings will be enough so you can afford your groceries.""
(she stares at me blankly for a few seconds)
(annoyed tone). ""Boy, price must really not be an issue when you're spending other people's money. You're stupidity of not looking at prices when you shop is not my problem.""

That's when she paid cash for the balance."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c3rgsj	2019-06-22 16:09:58	blah74715	AITA for choosing to tell my mom about my pregnancy/miscarriage the day she is hosting my sisters bridal shower?	"Hi Reddit,

This week has been a doozy. On Sunday after noticing I was late I took a pregnancy test and saw that it was positive. I went to the doctor on Wednesday to get bloodwork done which confirmed I was pregnant. On Thursday night I started to have some cramping and spotting and panicked that it might be a miscarriage since they’re quite common early on. After work on Friday I went directly to the emergency room and was there for over 10 hours while they performed a million tests on me and told me that I was indeed miscarrying and not just that, I have a rare blood issue that can cause me to potentially mount an immune response attacking future pregnancies. It was an incredibly rough night. My sisters bridal shower is at my parents house today and I had told my mother I would come home on Friday to help set up, obviously I did not anticipate being at the hospital for over 10 hours and didn’t make it home and got a few angry texts from my mother asking where I was. I felt ashamed and upset and wasn’t ready to let people other than my boyfriend know what was going on. I decided to head home early this morning to try to help with the last of the setup. Knowing that I’m still in the process of miscarrying and it may cause issues today (needing to lay down because of the pain/nausea) I decided I should sit my mom down and explain why I had been MIA and why I may not be as present today (since I am my sisters maid of honor and should be there all day). I explained to her what had happened and she looked upset/disgusted with me. She didn’t ask if I was ok. Didn’t offer up a hug or support. And basically told me to go upstairs so I was out of the way until I was ready to run errand and help. She lied and told everyone I had food poisoning and people started coming up to me with concerned looks asking if I was ok. I figured she told and in private I went off on her telling her to just stop talking about me and just stay out of it. 

I can’t decide if AITA for choosing to tell her now when she’s about to host a bunch of people?

Edit: she came to check on me while I was upstairs handling a work emergency. I blew her off because I’m hurt and honestly didn’t want to deal with it and really did need to handle the work emergency. In my eyes waiting 5 hours to finally check on me at a point where the house is full of people I don’t want to broadcast this to was unacceptable. I’m still hiding out upstairs for a few minute breather."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3rf4h	2019-06-22 16:05:50	shots-by-leo	WIBTA if I sat my friend down and talked about his excessive smoking and unhealthy habits?	"Hi guys. Just wanted feedback here before talking with a good friend of mine as I don't want to do it if it's not my place.

I have a good handful of friends who smoke cigarettes, it's not uncommon. And I don't really find it to be a big deal. It's their life and they can do what they want, it's not my place to police them or be their parent, obviously. They know it's bad for them.

However, one really close friend of mine in particular is a excessively bad about smoking cigarettes. I'm talking nearly a pack a day. 

We reconnected after a few years of not talking just because life gets crazy. This reconnection happened probably 6 months ago (we went to high school together and use to be close back then).

When we reconnected, he was getting over some sort of 'sickness' he claimed and was very phlegmy and was consistently spitting stuff out. I didn't think much of it because that happens, gotta get that shit out of your system to feel better. 

But over the last 6 months of us consistently hanging out again, he seems like he's always ""sick"" or fighting something off. He's always coughing stuff up. Aside from smoking cigarettes, he eats like shit, which I know also isn't my place to say anything but he doesn't seem like he's ever feeling better and I am genuinely worried about him. Mostly for the smoking as that's probably the biggest factor. 

It's also worth mentioning that he has asthma and he still smokes cigarettes.

We're both in our mid 20s if that means anything.

I just love my friend and don't want to overstep or say anything that isn't in my place to say but I am genuinely worried that he is killing himself with his smoking habits.

c3rdfm	2019-06-22 16:01:55		WIBTA if I told my roommates I'm not responsible for cleaning?	"Setting the scene: I have three roommates. I have a full time retail job and I also walk dogs and housesit. My days off are spent doing the latter. My boyfriend lives about 45 minutes away and I tend to spend more time at his place than mine. Two of my roommates work Monday through Friday, 9-5 jobs. One of them works from home. Each one has a pet that sheds and I don't have any pets. 

Recently, the roommate who works from home politely told us that she feels she's been doing all the cleaning around the house. I think she's right. She does more cleaning than anyone else, mostly because she's at home all day alone. The rest of us, for the most part, just clean up any messes we make, but don't go out of our way to clean the house top to bottom very often. 

We started a chore list on the fridge and as soon as we started marking what we've done that week, I realized how little time I spend at home. One of my roommates called me out after the first week for not having my name on the list as much as the others. 

But honestly? It's because between work, dog walking, housesitting, and staying with my boyfriend, I was maybe at home for around an hour, to grab things and then leave to go to work. The only nights I spend there are after I've worked from morning to night, and then I go home and go to bed. 

I've been trying to catch up to everyone, but it's rare to have enough time to clean the house thoroughly. If I'm not making the mess, or have a pet that sheds all over the house, am I as responsible to clean it as my roommates? I'm perfectly fine with cleaning whenever I get the time, but I don't want to be nagged if I don't clean as many times a week as my roommates. 

I don't want to be an asshole about this, so I just needed to know if I'm being irrational before I say anything. 

TL;DR I don't spend as much time around the house as my roommates, so I don't think I'm as responsible for cleaning."		1	0
c3rclb	2019-06-22 16:00:05		AITA for hating a job my boyfriend helped me get??	"So recently I (F19) was looking for a new job to save up money during the summer. I was having trouble finding jobs to call me back but my boyfriend (M22) used to work at a retail store and offered to help me get a job there. So he called and recommended me and a few weeks later I got hired. I was very grateful and made sure to thank him for helping me out.

The only problem is that I hate this job.  I work as a cashier and the customers are awful. I’ve been sexually harassed more than a few number of times and my managers refuse to do anything about it, I wanted to be part time and they schedule me at least 42 hours a week. I’m tired, and hate going to work because I know some man is going to make unwanted comments towards me and it’s just uncomfortable. It is also just a job I don’t really like doing. 

I haven’t told my boyfriend how much I hate this job and want to quit because I feel ungrateful, especially since me quitting so early would look bad on him since he recommended me.

I have always assumed that when you move out you now have your own life and can't expect things will be the same. 

For contexts sake, I still live with my family.

Recently, I was asked by my father if I wanted to go on a small trip with them. I answered yes. I didn't think much of it, because we have done these kinds of trips *many times* before.

Today I was texting with my bro, and in passing I say ""Oh we're going on a small trip"". Suddenly he asks me why he wasn't invited. Thought he was joking at first, so I reply ""Pardon?"". He's not joking.

The way he sees it, when the family plans something they should **always** consider all members, even if they have moved out.

The way I see it, as soon as you have moved out you can't expect to be invited to every thing the family does. Not out of spite, but since you have your own life now.

During our argument, he says ""Don't blame them (my parents). You could've invited me as well.""

I never thought much of it before. I have always accepted the fact that when I move out my family will do stuff without me, and I am completely fine with that (and I expect it to happen). They'll invite me when they want to invite me.

I think it's worth pointing out that there is no bad blood between any of us in the family, but now I'm sitting here feeling guilt over the whole thing...

"Ok so here’s the deal it’s entirely possible I’m being an asshole. I’m (bride) planning a wedding, just finished moving, and am about to start a grad program so I’m a tiny bit stressed and may just be overly reactive. My fiancé and I are young and finally saved a bit of cash to have a wedding. Of note my mother also is contributing money because she’s southern catholic and hates that we’re living together “in sin” and wanted to push the process along. 

We’re not having a massive wedding but we’re trying to make it plush for those who we have invited. I went cheap on my dress/shoes, am hand-making center pieces and such so that we can have a sit down dinner with an open bar. The place we’re having the wedding/reception offers a bundled package for a rehearsal dinner and morning after brunch. If we wanted to we could add people to these things for an additional charge per person. 

  We decided to invite aunts/uncles/etc on top of wedding party & parents to the rehearsal dinner. My aunt replies to my message saying that if X(extended relation) comes for the wedding she would bring her too. I was taken aback as I had not invited X to the rehearsal dinner just the wedding. I told her not to make promises to X. She got upset saying that she knew so and so probably weren’t going to make it so X could just take one of their places. I told her it wasn’t her place to invite X and that so and so had not spoken to me so I was going to presume their attendance until they did. She and my mom are upset that I won’t just say X can come. They feel that there’s no reason she shouldn’t be able to if so and so doesn’t, because then it’s not charging me extra, but I know if they extend the offer it will be expected even if so and so does come. It’s just one persons upcharge so it wouldn’t break the bank but also I kind of just want to save the money even if the original party doesn’t come.

This is Canada so my plans consist of making money, working out and smoking weed until school (of which I'm already done planning out). She recently dropped out of high school, has no future plans, has nowhere else to live (family problems) and has no stable friends. We've been together for 1 year and that's the longest relationship I've had up to this point. The problem is that I don't want to be locked into a relationship like this so early on in my life, but breaking up with her upsets almost every aspect of my life and basically ruins hers. When school comes around, she wants to just follow me where I go and that scares me a little bit. Any feedback or advice is much appreciated!!		1	0
c3r9x5	2019-06-22 15:53:42	trb850mp	AITA for being unsympathetic to my aunt about her Parent Plus loan?	"I was at lunch with some family a few weeks ago, including my aunt. Her daughter wasn't there but people asked how she was. My aunt was upset about how she still hadn't got a job yet that she can afford the full monthly payments on ""her"" student loan which my aunt admitted was a Parent Plus loan so ""she's stuck paying it"". My cousin graduated a year ago so payments began late 2018.

I've worked at a university so I'm familiar with these loans. Frankly they suck and my aunt is an idiot for taking one out expecting her daughter to pay it. That's something no one should EVER do. Parent Plus loans are loans in the parent's name the student has ZERO legal obligation to pay. This is stated in the forms she had to sign to take them out. Furthermore they have higher interest rates than standard student loans and accrue interest while the student is in school, unlike some loans in the student's name. My parents and I went over this while I was in college. Most of the loans were taken out by myself and I'm still paying them. My mother took out a much smaller amount in Parent Plus loans. She has repaid them. She never once asked me to do so.

Furthermore if my cousin had taken out Stafford loans in her name she would be eligible to get the payments reduced based on her current income. Parent Plus loans do not have this option, even based on the parent's income. It sounds like my aunt took out the loan instead of having my cousin do it because that was more ""responsible"" than having an 18 year old do it. This is bullshit and if she had talked to anyone in financial aid at the university or her sister (my mother) who had experience with this she'd have learned this instead of taking out $30k+ on some uneducated assumptions.

So frankly hearing this kind of annoyed me. I told her I was sorry her daughter hadn't found a very good job yet but the loan isn't her daughter's, it's hers and the daughter has ZERO legal obligation to pay it, and this was all stated in the form she signed taking out the loan and if she didn't want for this to happen she should've just had her daughter take out most of the loans as I did and that I hoped this was a learning experience for anyone there who had kids not in college yet. She got very cold to me, and some of the other people kind of gave me a cold stare too and seemed upset.

Am I out of line? I get how frustrating the situation is, but it could've been easily avoided doing basic research about this stuff that anyone should do, and that my parents did themselves and avoided all this.

c3r9o6	2019-06-22 15:53:07	AxisofAmazing	AITA if I (M17) initially said Yes to a girl's ask to a dance then told her No in private?	"Throwaway.

So at our high school, we have three different dances every year. For one of the dances, instead of the boy asking the girl, the girl would ask the boy. It makes for a nice mix up. Everyone is the same age in this if that's important.

&#x200B;

So to provide some background to the situation, I've been seeing this girl I really like, I'll call her Abby, for a few months. We haven't been super public about our relationship so not everyone in the school is aware, mostly just her and my friend group and a few outsiders. I knew she was going to ask me to this dance soon. (because she told me she was working on a sign/poster for me). I couldn't wait. She's amazing.

&#x200B;

Now the situation begins. Enter another girl, I'll call her Emma. I guess I'm friends with Emma, she's more Abby's friend than mine really but even she isn't that close with her. I've talked to her a few times. On the first day people start asking someone to the dance, Emma comes up to me with a very large crowd of people and a very elaborate sign and asks me to the dance. Normally, I would have told her no and apologized but she had really brought this whole crowd of like 30 people that stood around us in a circle. I was put in a spot. I didn't want to embarrass her so I told her 'Yes' to the roaring applause of all her friends. After the situation had died down like ten minutes later, I quickly pulled her aside in private and told her I couldn't accept her invite because of Abby's invite coming and that we were a thing. I told her I didn't want to publicly embarrass her in front of her friends by saying no. She gets all pissy and calls me an asshole.

&#x200B;

So reddit, I have come to see my judgement. AITA?

(I tried to attach the picture to this post but it won't let me) Anyway, I wear built up shoes that allow me to walk.

I moved to this small town with my mobility dog and the lady next door has told everybody in town that I am a faker and today her boyfriend was putting their yard sale sign on my fence & we were talking about my dog who he said he was surprised how she wasn't paying attention to him as he put the sign up. I told him it's because she is a mobility dog so she is trained to pay attention to me.

He scoffed and said he sees me getting around and I look OK to him and then how I can't have anything very bad wrong. I said no, actually it is a very serious disability and I fall constantly as well as having a really hard time getting around.

Honestly, I was kind of shocked and couldn't voice how insulted I felt.

These guys are some of the best friends I’ve had. It then hit 10:30pm and I get a call from my mum, she tells me to GET HOME NOW, I say no.

She then starts going ballistic and demands me to come home. I tell her that I’m an adult now and I don’t need to have a bedtime. I ask her why should I come home and she replies with “I can’t sleep with you out and not at home”. I reply with I’m not a kid anymore, me being out at these times is going to become a reality and you need to realise that. 

She keeps insisting that I come home. I start getting pissed off that she isn’t listening to anything I say (I’ve had conversations with her about this before) and I tell her that fine, I’ll come home but next time you’re not telling me when I can go out and when I need to come home, and that you should leave me alone and stop bugging me because I’m not a damn kid anymore stop being so protective. I told her I understood how she instinctively cared as a mother but restricting your child from having fun and being happy is not good. I also told her this is the final time she tells me to come home or anything similar because I’m not going to throw my happiness and life experiences away for someone who hasn’t realised that their son is a grown adult now who can take care of himself. I’ve told her on multiple occasions that I’m able to take of myself.

I’m pretty pissed off because I was enjoying myself with friends, something I’ve been pretty much deprived of by my mum, since she never lets me stay over at friends houses or even late night. I’m super fucking pissed though because I’ve explained to her on numerous occasions that I’m no longer in need of you looking over me and whatever I do, JUST LET ME BE. But she doesn’t understand and it’s due to her not understanding or simply straight up ignoring me that I have been unable to hang out with these friends and create fond memories and experiences with.

I’m a 19-year-old girl in college, living together with some roommates. I didn’t know them well before the last couple of months, but I’ve recently gotten closer with them, and especially with 19f who I’ll call Jocelyn. 

Jocelyn has a longtime friend from high school who I’ll call Benjamin (19m). I drunkenly kissed Benjamin a while ago, which didn’t really mean anything other than I thought he was cute, but I backed off after Jocelyn told me that she liked him. Anyways, because of that incident, I have Benjamin’s phone number and a way to contact him.

I was out of town for a couple of weeks, and when I got back, Jocelyn told me that she and Benjamin had slept together a couple of times and had hung out a lot during that time. Which is great! But then they both kind of fell out of the pattern of hanging out, and Benjamin has supposedly been very distant ever since then. They haven’t brought up what happened or talked about it in any way.

I’m a big fan of communication, and I’ve been trying to encourage Jocelyn to talk to Benjamin. She has texted him, but always claims that he’s too distant and dismissive of her messages for her to actually bring up the subject. I know she’s hurting and wants to talk about it, but she’s also told me that it’d mean more if it were Benjamin who reached out to her.

Like I mentioned before... I have Benjamin’s number. There’s a part of me that really wants to reach out to him, to gauge what he thinks of all this and encourage him to talk to/communicate with Jocelyn, because I think Jocelyn might be too stubborn to text him first again.

So my question: would there be any harm in texting something along the lines of: “hey, just reaching out to ask if you had any intention of talking to Jocelyn about what happened between you both? Communication is important and I’d hate to see you guys lose a good connection over this.”

I don’t want to fuck up a friendship with my roommate over interfering with her love life, but I also feel like a bit of encouragement is needed in this situation in order to get them to talk. Not big into drama, but I feel like I want to reach out to Benjamin.

Her boyfriend 22(M)
Me: 30(M)
We have been friends for about 5years. VERY CLOSE. Over that period of time, I have not cared too much about her cheating habits, she frequently did cheat, but it wasn’t my business. I’d end up hearing about it. But they were all true romantic interests of hers.

But this time seems different. 

She has made it clear to me shes just using this guy to buy her things. And when he stops buying her things? She will cry, claim he doesn’t love her, and ghost the guy for a few days till he dumps MAD CASH on her. I’m talking THOUSANDS in jewelry, RENT PAYMENTS,Student LOAN PAYMENTS. 

Her: “it’s the best deal ever. This kid had some weird medical condition as a kid so he has zero dating experience, he was homeschooled. No guy would ever put up with this, it’s so easy.”

Once I heard “condition” I decided i couldn’t morally just hear her talking about this anymore.

Pulled up a “text free” account. And blasted the kids number audio of what she was saying about him.  I Told him to keep it between us, but break up with her. 
I Intentionally recorded the audio when she was describing her relationship with this guy to at least 10 friends, so I could remain anonymous. 

Problem?

The guy leaked the audio. And my friend is outed as an evil witch to everyone. She Can’t get dates, everyone hates her, and now most of the social circle that she had has disassociated with her to avoid the negative association.

I’m clearly an asshole for not coming up with a better way to do this. But I couldn’t think of another way to get this kid to understand that my random text was the truth, and not something she could
Just explain away with a bit of flirting. 

the kid isn’t “rich”. He has a trust fund of about 300k apparently.
My friend told me it was established by one of his grandparents to help him cope with whatever he has for his life.

She’s never done this before. Never shown this type of....cruel nature before....it’s always been extremely positive when we were around each other.
She was the only one who was there for me when my grandfather passed away.

c3r3ur	2019-06-22 15:38:42	dragon_spider_man	WIBTA for making spicy brownies?	"For a bit of background, I live in a state that allowed me to get a medical marijuana card, and I still live at home with Mom and Brother. I keep my whole stash, pieces and toothpicks and all, all boxed up and put away under my bed in a corner that's a bit hard to get to that you have to really look for to find. When I want to, I pull out the boxes, use my medicine, and instantly put everything away where it belongs instead of leaving it out and about.

Lately my mom and I have noticed some things that don't make sense, and between the two of us discussing it, it seems that my brother is stealing her (nicotine) vapes for hours at a time and somehow ""magically finding them"" when she mentions she cant find them, and now it looks like he's going through my stash too. Yesterday I came home to find my ashtray and my resin and keef jars ON my bed, my boxes were OPEN and (empty) medicine tubes were just left open and strewn about. I haven't hit up any dispensaries lately so luckily I was totally dry, and it doesn't look like anything is missing. And he was the only one home for hours.

Which leads us to the possibility of me being an asshole. We don't have ANY concrete evidence that he's doing this, so I'm already planning on getting a teeny little camera off Amazon for my room so I can record what goes on when I'm not around to see if I can catch him in the act. But my mom brought up the idea of also setting some little booby-traps to catch him. I still have a baggie that a THC brownie came in, and a box of brownie mix, so I suggested I make a batch of paprika/jalapeno seed brownies and putting one in the edible bag, then just ""innocently"" leaving it with the rest of my stash. But my mom EXPLODED at me and called me an asshole and said I'm just being a nasty b\*\*\*\* and that ""that would F\*\*\* HURT and its F\*\*\*\* UNCALLED FOR"" When I even tried to point out that 1) she could lose custody of the kid and 2) I could get in serious legal trouble over this, I got  ""NONONO SHUT THE F\*\*\* UP YOU WILL NOT GET ANY F\*\*\*\* ATTITUDE WITH ME WE AREN'T F\*\*\* ARGUING THIS"" So I just felt like a major asshole and walked away. I'm not putting anything gross like laxatives or rat poison in them! I was just thinking that if he ate a super spicy brownie, he would be so full of regret and hopefully never go near my stash again, and maybe he would know that I'm on to him at the same time! Win-win, right?

So reddit, would I be the asshole if I made some trick-brownies as a booby trap to catch my VERY underage brother breaking into and stealing my MMJ stash?

EDIT: Alright a ton of you are super hung up on how I keep my stash? I think that's kinda weird but I just wanted to save character limit instead of diving into the intricacies of my stash. But I guess it's really important to you guys lol. Yall are acting like I'mjust keeping baggies of nugs in a shoe box or something lolol when that's not even close to the case. I keep multiple boxes, for different stuff. I DO HAVE A MEDICINAL LOCK BOX!!!!!! STOP TELLING ME TO GET ONE!!! I keep the actual flower and wax  and dirty pipes IN THE LOCK BOX. There's no way he can get to it unless he figures out my code. I have two other boxes, one is a jewelry box with a secret compartment that i keep jewelry in the front, and tools like toothpicks and wax scoops in the secret compartment. The third box is just what I keep all my empty tubes in because you cant recycle them and I'm trying to figure out a way to keep them out of land fills. ALL of these boxes are waaaayyyyy under my bed, squeezed next to a bookcase. I have to crawl under my bed to get to it. But fuck me I guess I'm an asshole?

EDIT2: Ok somehow I guess I also made it seem like I must never ever talk to my brother and hate him with a passion or something?  You guys have all just decided that I never event talked to him about it? OF COURSE I HAVE WTF. I'm not just going to ambush him with spicy food. I tried many a time to sit him down and talk to him, just one on one, sibling to sibling no parents involved, ""I'm not mad this is just a really big deal and I'm worried about you"" etc. and you guys must know some SAINTS if you expect that to just work. Because, surprisingly enough, he just lied and continued his ways! I've tried talking to mom about it and she wont confront him because No Evidence, and she's made it abundantly clear that I am NOT to do anyyyyyything at all about this because I'm not his parent."

However, it was never given to me with the intention that I sell it, and I feel very conflicted about whether this would be an okay thing for mee to do. My dad has not mentioned it since he gave it to me and has likely forgotten so I don't really want to bring it up, and bad memories he might associate with it.

c3r2ly	2019-06-22 15:35:41	revaddict94	AITA for blowing up at my parents for suggest religion as solution for my problems	"TLDR at the end.
A bit of background: I come from a Hindu family. Growing up, my parents never really forced religion down my throat but they would always make me accompany them to temples and make me visit them on birthdays and other special events. I also didn’t mind accompanying them on random temple visits which would most often be woven into family vacations. I do remember a few instance of being forced to accompany them to temples during my teenage years but I would always resist and stay in the car or hotel room( temples in India are insanely crowded).
As I grew up, they were understanding of my atheistic views and would engage in occasional banter and debates, all in the spirit of ‘ proving me wrong’ . 
I’m currently in another country & graduated from an MS program. My parents have been extremely supportive of my career pursuits and financially supported me even though they haven’t been convinced about some of my career choices. I’ve been grinding hard this semester in pursuit of full time jobs and getting grilled through multiple rounds of interviews. Safe to say, luck hasn’t gone my way and I’ve been rejected for things out of my control like positions closing down or interviewers being harsh. Most recently, I got rejected from a job that I thought I was certain to get. Lately, my parents through various contextual hints or casual comments repeatedly suggest that luck hasn’t gone my way because I’m non religious. This has really taken a toll on me because I’m trying to reframe my mind to accept rejects and think positively through this draining period.
Last week, I blew up and told them to never speak to me again if they brought up religion as a solution to all my problems. I haven’t talked to them despite their repeated calls. I do feel bad for them because they want what’s best for me & honestly believe that worshipping an imaginary sky daddy(daddies cos Hinduism) will make things alright. AITA for doing this ?

TLDR- Religious parents want me to worship god to solve my job search issues. AITA for blowing up for their ‘advice’."	No A-holes here	0	0

My brother was in jail for over 6 months. I had no idea where he was for the longest time and only found out he was getting out about 2 weeks before he was released. My sister said that he was getting out saturday and she was picking him up and she said I wasn't allowed because everyone else wanted to go and no room in the car. 


Friday comes and my sister calls me and asks for any of my brother's id. I thought they needed some id for him to get out and thought no problem and said I will head over to see her later to prepare for seeing my brother after he is released from jail.


My sister said to call my mom after her because my mom is worried about not hearing from me. I made the call to my mom and my mom said that my brother was already out of jail and was with our family. I got angry because my sister never told me that my brother was with her when she called in the morning or even told me to say hello to my brother. I call and tell her how I felt about it because I'm not shy about expressing my feelings.

I tell my sister that I was upset about it and that it wasn't cool to keep that from me and she said my brother was with her when she called. My sister hung up on me when I got upset over the phone. I message her later and asked when I could see my brother? My sister responded by saying you know where the f**k he lives. I never saw him last and my sister did and that was the last response.

I was angry about my sister keeping things from me and don't I have the right to see my brother?

She is in love with the cosmetic industry and not only does she ‘keep up with the tea’, she also has had a moderate amount of success being sent makeup to review on her YouTube channel and the ability to monetize her videos. 

I deeply love and care for her, and I have also gone from being a man with 0 interest in makeup to a slowly passing interest solely to support her hobbies. I only do it so I can show her I love her and pay attention to her because it’s 90% of what she talks about. 

Lately my girlfriend has been seeing more men in media wearing makeup, like a full face of drag, and she wants to put makeup on me to just ‘try it out’. I have declined her requests maybe 6 or 7 times now and each time she gets more and more flustered. I’ve explained that whilst I support it and also have no problem with men wearing makeup, I personally don’t want to wear any. She first accepted it but lately she’s been ‘calling out my homophobia and transphobia’ and nothing I say is satisfactory to deter her from thinking that I have some sort of issue when the reality is I just want to not wear makeup. 

When I sat her down to try and seriously explain that whilst I loved her, I didn’t want to partake in this, she asked me if we ever have kids would I let them put makeup on me. I said yes I would, and she said there was no difference and that I’m in the wrong.

Never interested in friends and stuff. I was the same way for a long while. I've lived alone for about a year now, and barely see my family. I met my sister last week, and she sort of let it slip that she's spending her nights up by the lake with her friends, including older guys, and that she's tried driving a car and a moped. I know some of her friends her age like to drink and smoke, and I don't want to get my sister involved with that stuff.

I went through the same thing, isolated then I got friends and started doing dumb shit with them. Ended with me drinking so much I collapsed with chest pains one night at 18 and I don't want this shit happening to her. She's a brilliant kid, but I don't want her spending all her time hanging out with boys and people who drink and smoke. 

I won't lie, I tried a few things and got a bit promiscuous, and my body hates me for it. The last thing I want is for my sister to do the same shit I do, or even half of it. Sure, she's more responsible than me by far, but I'm worried for her. Our parents are working so she's on her own a lot.

Turned out it was just a single guy who somehow came into a lot of money and wanted to make games. Oh well the pay was decent and he was willing to hire someone with little experience and best of all he offered what he called profit sharing, basically when the game ships or is bought by an interested party I get a percentage of that, something like 7% after costs are taken care of.

He hired me as a programmer and a 'tech consultant' as he was pretty clueless about a lot of technical aspects that go into games. So basically I did everything while he 'took care of the writing' and world building as well as whatever business side stuff needs doing (not much I'd imagine) but he always looked busy at work so whatever.

Fast forward to last week my boss hires an artist to replace our place holder art. She is a ditzy lady covered in tattoos (not professional) she draws all day on her tablet and clocks out at 5:30 (when the boss tells us to leave) I usually stay late to catch up on some work only until 630ish as that's when my boss makes me leave as he doesn't want anyone at the office when he's not there (which is bullshit I've worked all by myself on days he was out sick!) So I've been doing a lot of work on my personal laptop.

Anyway it comes out that the artist got a similar deal to mine, albeit with less pay I think. So I've been here from the start and have done basically everything and she comes along with some drawings and gets the same credit as me basically. 

Fuck. That.

So I've pulled the latest build off my machine at work onto my laptop at home. My plan was just to ask my boss for a bigger cut when the game ships and if he refuses remind him how I basically control everything (I don't know if I'd outright threaten him he tries to be a nice guy) 

Well I told my girlfriend about my plan and she got really pissy. She said she didn't think I was the type of person that would even think of doing something like this. I argued my side but she stormed out. That got me worried if I'm being an asshole without realizing it, surely I'm entitled to a bigger cut than some airhead artist.

TLDR: Boss hires lady after and gives her the same deal as me, I do all the work so I deserve a bigger cut of profits than her, I plan on withholding work I've done to get what I want.

Edit: I'm not going to do it the consensus is that I'd be sued. So yay they win. Apparently I'm an asshole, and tattoos are awesome. I find it kind of funny everyone is calling me disrespectful because of the comment about her professionalism when they don't even know this lady. What if she had a bunch of dicks tattooed on her face? Is that acceptable?

Edit2: I was reading through the replies and I think I get it. I was really heated about all this and I saw her as a moocher and pointed at her tattoos (and honestly got hung up on them) as proof she was a not good worker. Rereading about a comment about how we are a team got me thinking. I think i cooked this up because I was tired and cracking under the pressure. My boss and her could be working just as hard as I am actually and are just handling it better. So yeah ITA."	Asshole	0	0

" I'm on the light end of the autism spectrum, and I genuinely don't know if I'm the ahole sometimes. I try not to be. Anyway, here's a conversation I had on a company's public forum. I include some posts from another user for context (they had a very similar issue to me; do they seem OK, but I seem a lot worse?).

&#x200B;

Cast: SM1 = a staff member posting in the public forum; SM2 = a different staff member who contacted me via private message; Me = me; Cus = another customer

&#x200B;

Public forum:

* SM1: ""We’ve sent all the emails hours ago. If you haven’t received one, check your spam folder. If it’s not there, please ping us on live chat with the email address you use on \[another company\], and we’ll sort it out!""
* Me: ""What hours is support supposed to work? I have an email related problem, CS didn’t understand, I clarified, and then have heard nothing since.""
* Cus: ""I haven’t received an email either. My email address is the same for both \[company\] and \[another company\]. I’ve opened a live chat request, but I’m worried this won’t get resolved in time as live chat doesn’t seem to operate over the weekend?""
* SM1: \[reply to Cus\] ""We will pick it up during the weekend or Monday morning, and we’ll make sure you are on the list.""
* SM1: \[reply to Me\] ""No worries, we’ll pick up your message and make sure you are on the mailing list \[...\]""

&#x200B;

That's all perfectly fine. Now to the private message:

* SM2: ""Another community member just sent me this

>Is it just me who finds him very toxic, sort of passive-aggressive style?

after you posted this

\[my post above\]

& presumably previous comments too. I have seen you making more of an effort to balance your posts but even so, don’t forget this conversation please.""

* Me: ""Tone may not come through well in text, but I really don’t think it’s fair to consider that comment “toxic”. It’s an entirely straight forward question and explanation of my issue. I got a useful reply.""
* SM2: ""You’ve been a customer & a user here for long enough to know that we don’t provide support over the weekend. And your query wasn’t urgent so there was no need to post the details of the issue. The problem isn’t that one post though, it just highlighted a pattern of behaviour (again) which seems passive aggressive.""
* Me: ""I didn’t know your supports hours. I felt it was urgent given the Tuesday deadline. I really don’t appreciate being attacked and criticised by you just for trying to get customer support. The member of staff who kindly replied to me did so professionally. You could learn about customer relations from him.""
* SM2: ""This discussion obviously isn’t going anywhere constructive so let’s make this simple: If we don’t see an improvement in your behaviour then your forum account will be suspended.""

So I am currently at work when about an hour ago I received a text from my mom asking me if I have plans today. I assumed she wanted to invite me and my boyfriend out to dinner since she has been wanting to meet him. I told her I had plans to go get my boyfriend and roommate dinner today from a restaurant we all really want to try. I promised them. I asked her if maybe we can meet up on Sunday instead.

She got all guilt trippy, saying ""Oh.....ok.... well I am going to work and I don't want to leave the dogs outside with the chickens. (Husband) is on a hunting trip. I guess I have to leave the dogs in the house.. I will mentally prepare myself for that mess...""

She has a tendency to throw pity parties before saying what she means, which is ""can you come over and watch the farm?"".

I am the default farm watcher for my family. I am ok with that. I get to be with the dogs I grew up with. But the way she ""asked"" me to do this favor rubbed me the wrong way. It doesn't make me want to help her .

I replied with ""you can just ask me instead of saying all that or maybe just put the chickens back in their pins""

She replied ""no....it's ok...I dont want to take away time from you and your boyfriend...your little brother is at his dad's house.""

How I feel about this is she's texting me at 9 o clock, and doesn't go to work until 1. Now I don't know what errands she may have, but I don't feel like I should be ditching my plans because she won't put the chickens up. In all fairness we do have 30 chickens. It is not easy to round up 30 chickens, believe me, but, again, she doesn't leave for work until 1 and she texted me at 9.

If she told me ahead of time that would be fine, or asked me nicely or whatever. She does not live far and this is not hard. But I'm a bit stuck on principal here. Am I being a brat? 

Or would I be an asshole for ditching plans that we were all excited for because chickens weren't put back in their pins?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c3quft	2019-06-22 15:15:13	KalliopeJones	AITA for telling a friend I am upset I feel like she mislead me?	"Jane and I met at work about 7 months ago and instantly became very close. I feel that support and kindness between us has been a two way street since day one. 

A few months ago I met Steve through a dating app. When I told Jane, she told me they have been friends for a few years. I didn’t ask too much about their history, she offered that they are like brother and sister and anything else is “ew gross”. She did express concern about two of her friends dating, not wanting to lose a friendship should it go bad. I assured her that wouldn’t happen on my end. 

Things went well with Steve and I at first but when it got a little rocky, I leaned on Jane for support. I don’t have a very healthy relationship history and I tend to fixate on things. So while I tried to not have this be the main topic of our conversations, it came up more often than not. 

Things ended with Steve not long ago and I am now working on moving on. This week it came up (again) in conversation with Jane. In this conversation Jane casually mentioned that Steve had had feelings for her and they had slept together. I told her I wished she had told me they dated and she said they didn’t date and she had asked me if I wanted any info about him but I declined. 

I became upset and felt as though she had mislead about their relationship. Later that evening when she was texting me, I responded to one of her messages saying that I was feeling very upset and I felt like she had mislead me. And that I am not comfortable dating someone my friend had previously been involved with. That finding this info out made me more upset about a situation I was still not over. She simply replied okay. 

However she ignored me the rest of the week at work and when I tried to talk to her through IM, she told me she didn’t want to and “I’m out”. I tired approaching her and she said “I’m busy, go away” The friendship seems to be over. 

Am I the asshole for not asking for more information up front? Did I over react when I got upset? Should I have just bit my tongue until I got over it? Or is her reaction extreme?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Anyway, since my sister wasn't home I figured I could play a little prank on her, so I went to her room and moved some stuff. Nothing destructive, just moving her dresser, turning the TV the opposite direction and stacking her chairs. Just to mess with her, easy to reverse shit. Anyway, she got home and called my dad. Apparently she thought they had a break-in and was freaking out.

c3qsll	2019-06-22 15:10:52	HidesBehindAnonymity	AITA for leaving the window open on a plane?	So I’ve never actually been called an asshole for leaving the window open on a plane. I usually pay for window seats because I think flying is fucking crazy... you’re being held up by invisible particles! I like looking out the window pretty much the whole time even on longer flights. I fly a lot for work and I never thought about my dilemma until one time; the woman next to me asked me if I could please close it (she was super nice about it) so I did. Kind of bummed me out because I had a layover in NYC and I’ve never been, so I wanted to see the city from the plane when we were landing. I didn’t want to disturb her, she was sleeping, so I didn’t open it until the last few minutes of the flight... I still got to see the city, I would’ve liked to see more, but this got me thinking. What’s the general consensus on air plane windows? Do you guys think that people in the window seat should close it? Do you not give a shit? What does the general population think? Obviously I’d be more than happy to close it if someone wants to sleep and they asked me to, but if we’re flying over something interesting like mountains, AITA for reopening it? I’m more worried about people with anxiety or people who avoid confrontation who are annoyed by it but wouldn’t say anything, AITA for not closing it in that case?	No A-holes here	0	0

So as you can see from the title, there is a lot of nsfw art and artists on Twitter so I usually see those types of art,yes there is even furry porn art and whatever you can imagine.

So yesterday I was exploring my Twitter and stumble upon a nsfw furry art,no big deal,then I noticed that this furry character didn't have a tail, which is weird,it looked like a wolf character so of course I was a bit confused about it so then I decided to ask a pretty normal question;(A=Artists)

Me:""where is her tail?""

A:""she doesn't have one.""

I was still confused but then I felt like my mind was trying to tell me to say a joke about it.

THE JOKE:
so... You guys know what a butt plug is, right?well you know the ones that have a tail at the other side of the butt plug? That makes it look like you have a tail? Yeah, I decided to reply with a butt plug joke.

Me:""well know she can!""*with a picture of a single tail butt plug I found on Google*

I was expecting the reply to be like ""ha ha nice try "" or "" nah she's pass lol"",something like that, but the reply was...

A:""uhh no""

I don't think A got the joke so I kept replying , trying to make it obvious that I was joking by replying

Me:""yo digo que sí lol""( which translates to ""I'd say yes lol"") *and even replying with a meme*

A:""and I say no :)"" *blocks me*

Ok that was a very short conversation and that was enough to get me blocked ,wtf.
So I started to think what I did to make A block me for just one,small conversation.

A. I was being annoying and my joke weren't funny

B. A was uncomfortable

C. A thought I was asking for an art request

D. A didn't know what a tail butt plug is and thought it was just a tail and thought I was insisting that A should give that character a tail.

E. I sounded like a pervert (but c'mon, A literally draws porn)

So these last 3 weeks she has come up to me and asked if I was ok because I was feeling a bit down. I never told her because I thought she hated me because she still had me blocked on Snapchat and made me feel like I did something wrong.

So today I was feeling awful and decided to message her. I messaged her and told her I felt alone and felt like no one is really there for me and was being treated unfairly She messaged back saying that she doesn't know what to say and said it's other people so she can't help. I said well I'm sad so I wanna speak to someone take my mind off it and she told me those 3 weeks that it's ok to open up and get help and talk to folk. She said the same thing and said she doesn't know what to say. So I brought up why she was so concerned by me and coming up to me and asking if I was ok 3 weeks ago but when I ask her for advice and a talk she just says she doesn't know what to say. She replied again and said I don't know what to say to you.

I just left it there and ignored her

He then called me and was extremely loud, rude and angry and cussing me and saying things like ""you only care about yourself you stupid asshole"" and ""you caused me embarrassment in front of my friend"" I asked him if he only called to cuss at me, and then he said no, ""I'm heading home bring my wallet"", I was like ""Okay, fine.""

She starts talking about some mundane shit, asking me about a thing we are doing later today.

Then all of a sudden, as Im sitting there mid sentence, I watch as she proceeds to stick her finger up her nose, pull it out, inspect it, and then casually wipe it across the sleeve of the shirt she is wearing. Holy fuck.

I couldn't help but ask...""Did I really just see that?"" And she acts surprised like I didn't just sit there and see it with my own eyes.

""Did you just dig up your nose and then wipe it on your sleeve? Did I really see that happen?"".

Then she starts laughing and says ""Yes...what was I supposed to do with it?""  

My instant response was How about getting up and grabbing a tissue, a paper towel, a napkin...a fucking dirty sock from the hamper....anything but the verg shirt you are wearing.

And being 100% honest I told her it was one of the laziest things I had ever witnessed, and if I caught my 5 year old doing the same thing Id probably spank his ass.

c3qel3	2019-06-22 14:36:01	MaggieTheFangirl	WIBTA if I don't help my friends with our group project?	"So me and two of my friends have to do a group project for school where we have to edit a video essay. It's due on Monday and because we didn't get very far in school we decided to split the work evenly in 3 parts and edit it at home.

What you should know is I'm quite an overachiever and perfectionist. I love video editing and I already did a lot of work for this project, like writing the 4 page script, recording it at home and organising everything while they looked for footage online. That didn't bother me that much because I wanted it to be good and they don't seem to care as much as I do.

I already finished my part of the video today because I have to study for an exam on Tuesday and I wanted to be done with it as early as possible. The whole thing is edited with Adobe Premiere Pro and everybody who has ever worked with it knows what a bitch it can be. I was lucky and didn't have any problems with it but my team mates not so much.
They both texted me today that their file won't open on their laptops. It's the same file as mine and they have the same version as me. The only difference is that I work on a PC that's a lot faster and better.

I saw this coming a while ago because my friends laptop is absolute crap and this happens a lot. I already thought about what to do in that case and the only option I see now is that I have to edit the whole thing myself. But I really don't want to do this because I wanted to have time to study for my exam, which I wouldn't have then. I'm talking about at least 4-6 hours of work.

They didn't specifically ask me to edit their parts, but the way they write in our group chat, it seems like the only option. It feels like they are waiting for me to offer my help and if I dont do that I feel bad.
I don't know what effect this would have on their grade but our teacher is nice and likes me so I don't think it would affect MY grade since he already saw that I did most of the work.

I believe them when they say it doesn't work and I know its not their fault, but it's also not my fault. But they are also my friends and shouldn't I help them when they need me?

c3q4y2	2019-06-22 14:11:16	Krieger2366	AITA for ending a love triangle/ friendship with a coworker	"So I work in hospo. A coworker and I had a very flirtatious relationship at work, (things like feeding each other food, slapping each other on the ass and even a few cases of her intentionally grinding her ass on my groin when squeezing through the small walkways). We were also good friends that shared intimate details of each other’s lives and just got along really well. It was obvious to other coworkers that we had chemistry. I was even asked by senior members to tone it down while at work. The whole time this was happening I was under the assumption from what she said. That she was single and that she broke up with her ex but she still had sex with him on occasion. 

Eventually one night she wanted to “hang out” after work and she came back to my house, we watched a movie, played some video games, smoked some weed and one thing led to another and we were in bed things were getting heated and we were just about to finish with foreplay when she stopped and said that she’d gotten back with her ex a few months ago and he was currently on holiday in another country and she felt bad about cheating. Obviously we stopped there and she left. 

She told the boyfriend what happened and he was pissed. However the flirting at work remained exactly the same as beforehand. After about 2 months of this she messaged me late at night and asked me to pick her up from a party, she was drunk and her boyfriend was out of country again and she “really wanted to see me” I just dropped her home this time. 

Recently I went to a music festival and had a life changing experience, my feelings towards her changed. When I came back I no longer had any desire to flirt with my her or do anything that we did before. We went from close friends to strangers in the one week that I was away for the music festival. The change in behaviour was obvious, she noticed it and so did other coworkers. I had several coworkers ask me about it or telling me that she was asking them if I had said anything about why I had changed and if she did something to anger me. They also commented that it was a love triangle and she’s hurt by me removing myself from it. 

It’s been like this for a few months now but have started feeling guilty as I feel like I’m treating her harshly by going from friends to strangers considering she didn’t actually do anything to me to warrant this behaviour. I treat her with politeness and professionalism now and we only speak when it’s work oriented.

Am I the asshole for the way I treat her now?

TLDR: super flirty relationship with coworker, nearly have sex but it turns out she has a boyfriend. Weird love triangle ensues but after taking a life altering amount of drugs at a music festival I decide to stop flirting and the friendship falls apart, The relationship we have now is polite and professional.

c3q4rs	2019-06-22 14:10:47		AITA for hitting my best friend with a badly timed bit of harsh truth?	"My best friend in this world is in an emotionally abusive relationship. Recently, they split up for a couple of weeks over what I (and she, at the time) viewed to be a completely inexcusable offense on his part--he abandoned her at a party nearly 4 hours from home with no clothes, ride, or money, leaving her stranded in one of the most dangerous metropolitan cities in the Midwest.

As is often the case with abusive relationships, this is not the first time they've split up over his behavior. Every time it happens, myself and her other support group of friends gently (and sometimes not so gently) point out that hey, maybe there's some red flags here that should be taken into account. Each time, she acknowledges them, and each time, she goes back.

Earlier this week, she told me she was going back to him on the condition that they see a therapist regularly and that he acknowledge and work on his flaws, or she is leaving him for good. That is her choice and I can't make it for her, though I strongly disagree with it and don't feel it is in her best interest--but she also kept citing a statistic which says that, on average, abused women will leave their partners 7 times before staying gone for good; as though that justifies her going back, somehow. That same night, she messaged me about a completely unrelated topic and asked, ""Am I crazy for getting worked up over this?""

At that time, I was at my absolute lowest point. I was angry--not with her, but with with her choice--upset and distraught. So without thinking about it first, I replied ""Not any crazier than using abuse statistics to justify going back to being abused"". I immediately felt horrible, and apologized profusely. I got an ""Ok"", and that was it. That was the last real contact I've had with her for three days.

I know deep in my core that our last 4 years of extremely close friendship isn't going to be ruined by a badly timed bit of harsh truth on my part, but she has *never* ghosted me before. We've disagreed, we've argued, we've said things that have rubbed each other the wrong way, but there has always been communication of some sort. Now, I'm completely in the dark, and I can't help but feel like it's my own fault. I'm devastated that she won't give me *something*, *some* explanation as to why she's so silent. Even it's it's just a ""Hey, I need some space right now"". Even a ""That really pissed me off, fuck off for awhile"" would be fine. Just something.

And then another part of me says she's not ghosting me, and to just calm the fuck down because she just needs space and will talk when she's ready.

c3q14i	2019-06-22 14:01:26		AITA For Taking a break from my (18M) current relationship (17F)?	"We are both going to college soon at the same university, and we met in high school. However, for about a month and a half, she has been growing distant and seems to never get any sleep. When I pressed her on the issue, she reported being caught in negative thought patterns, and being up all night on the phone with friends trying to talk her through it. When I asked her about them, she told me it was about how she wanted to grow up and be her own person and 'meet other people'. I'm the only guy she's ever been with. However, at the same time, she isn't dumping me. It threw me for a loop!

After taking a day with that information, I proposed that we take a break. When she wants the break to be over, she reads a book from her childhood that she really likes and gave to me a while ago to read, and then texts me, ""I read the book"". Otherwise, we'll just stay friends.

I proposed all this at her house while we met last night. She was crying pretty much the whole time. Am I the asshole for leaving her like that, and not just ending it myself? I still really love her, and I didn't want any of this, but I felt like she needed time and agency to make the decision for herself."		1	0
c3pzvj	2019-06-22 13:58:04	JSkellington88	AITA for canceling the babysitter so my husband has to stay home with the kids?	"A while back me and the husband were invited to a party for a friend of mine. We had the next door neighbor’s 13 year old daughter lined up to watch the kids (we have 5 boys). It would have been her first time with all of them. Originally, her parents (and our good friends) had plans but would be home shortly after we left to help her out if needed. 

This past Wednesday her dad got into some big trouble and ended up in jail. We have been supporting his wife and daughter with dinner for the past few nights, and my husband and I both did not go to work on Thursday following the incident to watch their dog and be there for support. 

I wrongly assumed it was understood that she would be not obligated to babysit this Saturday (today) because of the stress going on. She offered to still watch the kids, but I told her not to worry about it and I would get ahold of her later in the week for a date night (we share custody of our older boys and so later in the week it would just be our two younger boys—more manageable). 

Last night we had some friends over and I said something about going to the party for a couple hours while he stayed home with the kids. He had no idea I had cancelled the sitter and was upset that I wanted to still go by myself. I realize that I should have talked to him first, but I didn’t realize it would be that big of a deal to him since it was my friend’s party, and he doesn’t particularly like her. 

For context and to try and be neutral, him and I don’t get out much alone, so I know he’s disappointed, but I feel like there should be some understanding given the situation.

c3pzph	2019-06-22 13:57:38		AITA for not taking care of a dog I wanted no part in?	"**TL;DR:** Mom brings home puppy without consulting me, expects me to take care of it.

---

Back in January, my beloved childhood dog passed away. I have been vocal about not getting another dog since before she even passed. Around the beginning of June, my mom started expressing desires to get another dog. I continued to express my feelings of not wanting to get another dog. I did not want the responsibility because I know I would be the one taking care of it because I am lucky enough to be able to work from home (I also pay $800 a month for rent).

Fast forward a bit and my mom comes home one day with a 7-month-old puppy without consulting me. I told my mom that I would not do a single thing to help with this puppy. I will not take it on walks, I will not feed it, I will not bathe it, I will not clean up its messes, etc. She says that I'll come around eventually.

Monday rolls around (she brought the puppy home on a Friday) and my mom is getting ready to leave for work and she asks me what I plan to do with the puppy while she is at work. I told her that I'm going to lock her in the crate and she will stay there until she gets home. My mom gets angry with me and tells me that the puppy shouldn't be locked up all day. I tell her that the puppy would be locked up all day if I wasn't living with her, so what's the difference?

Jump another week and my mom has decided to let the puppy start sleeping with her. Unsurprisingly the puppy wakes up at the buttcrack of dawn every morning. This is normally not a problem because my mom wakes up at 5:15 a.m. every day. That was until today.

This morning, just like every morning this past week, the puppy gets up super early but this time my mom has the audacity to lock the puppy out of her room so she can sleep in. This was at 5:30 a.m. and it is now 9:00 a.m. and my mom has yet to come out of her room. The puppy has peed and pooped in the house already and it is past her breakfast time. The puppy is scratching at my mom's door and keeps coming to me whining. I am tempted to let the puppy into my mom's room.

I feel bad for the puppy, but I was vocal about my feelings. AITA?"		1	0

My mom and I got an invitation to my dad's cousin's wife's baby shower. (My dad's cousin's baby). It was only addressed to my mom and I meaning guys aren't allowed. 

(We will call my dad's cousin Jeff.)

We rarely get to see this couple (hell I didn't even know they existed) and when we do it's usually for a funeral. Jeff's mom (my dad's aunt) is an alcoholic and doesn't have any contact with the family (of my knowledge) besides my grandpa (dad's dad). But, Jeff's mom is my grandpa's ex-wifes (no divorce she passed away) sister (sister in law). So my grandpa and Jeff's mom aren't blood related. They call each other and text each other quite often.  I don't know if Jeff's mom will be at the baby shower. If she is it will be really awkward because the extended family has only seen her once or twice and it has been years since we've seen her.

Anyways, my grandpa got diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer three weeks ago. His life expectancy is 4 months, but he started chemo so we are hoping that will extend it. He never gets to see Jeff's mom because they only text, and I'm sure they would love to see each other. Who knows if my grandpa will ever get to see Jeff's mom again. My grandpa has been feeling really shitty because of all the side effects of chemo, and I'm hoping this will cheer him up.

c3pym1	2019-06-22 13:54:36	BootsandBeaches	AITA for making friends of a friend wait outside for them?	"Hey all, so this just happened last night but some people are already getting upset with me so I'd really appreciate a little perspective before I start having these conversations with them.

Last night a few co workers and I went out for drinks and when the bar closed some people wanted to stay out. I had friends having a small after party that I invited my co workers to (after okay-ing it with the host first) and we all went our separate ways. 

Fast forward and I'm at the after party (which was very small, like just a few of us sitting around having a night cap) and these 2 people show up that I don't know. They had been at the bar but I hadn't talked to them or even been introduced really and I didn't feel comfortable with them coming in. They said they were friends of one the co workers, but she wasn't there yet. When I called she said she was still ""a good distance away"". I told them they'd have to wait for her, but when she showed up she was really mad about it and just went home without letting any of us (inside) know. 

My line of reasoning was that A.) I didnt know them and genuinely felt uncomfortable having drunk strangers around a small apartment, B.) It was a very small group and it would have been pretty awkward it try to assimilate them, especially not knowing them myself and C.) If they ended up being loud/obnoxious/any array of terrible traits I didnt want my friend to blame me and not want to invite me to these things anymore. Co worker thinks I was very rude since I did see them at the bar and that it wasnt even my apartment to gatekeep (host was aware of situation and agreed/said it was my call).

So was I being a drunk, overdramatic asshole last night? Any thoughts appreciated since I do still have to work with the person who's friends I exiled on the porch"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I frequently book relatively small shows, due to my contacts from when I was in a band and my work in booking at a now closed venue. Recently a mid-level sized band (by underground standards, pretty small overall) inquired about an upcoming tour. I found a venue that was open their requested night, and got a show booked. I posted on a local Facebook group with a list of upcoming shows including that one.

Some girl started throwing a fit in the comments talking about how she hates that venue. When some people asked why she said it was because it was in a poverty-filled black neighborhood and shows there resulted in ""privileged white people"" ""invading"" the area. She also started talking about gentrification (this is not an area that has been heavily impacted by gentrification) and how this venue owned by a white guy was causing direction competition to ""PoC owned businesses"" in the area and denying a space that could go to a ""PoC owned business."" This girl was very white by the way.

Another girl chimed in about how she disliked the venue because it was near a mosque and thought it was Islamophobic to serve alcohol so close and in an area with a large Muslim immigrant population due to Islam's prohibition of alcohol and because ""alcohol has caused so much trouble and destruction to PoC communities."" The area is probably only about 10% Muslim. Regardless I thought this was absurd, there's a McDonalds in the area too serving bacon products, is that a problem?

Most of the rest of the responses told them they were ridiculous. Is it insensitive booking at this venue?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3pvyo	2019-06-22 13:47:28	spreadhummusnothate	WIBTA for saying no when a girl asked me to be her bf? (Context below)	So long story short, I only recently started talking to this girl, in my head it’s a friendship and I never really wanted any more from it than that. But I’m a generally supportive friend and I’m always complimenting my friends and being generally really nice to them and all. Which is fine normally. But this girl that became my new friend recently seems to have taken my “trying to be a good friend” as more than that. She broke up with her boyfriend at the time and asked me to be her boyfriend Cus I’m more supportive and always makes her feel good about herself and I’ve jus generally been a better person to her than the boyfriend has. Idk about how much of that is true of their relationship since I’ve not even known her long enough to get round to talking about him (I didn’t even know he existed until basically just now), but, i just wanted a new friend so that’s why I talked to her, and now I’d feel so guilty if I said no (which is what I wanna do) because she literally broke up with a guy for me, but on the other hand. I’d feel even worse if I said yes because I don’t even see her like that and I kinda have someone I already like so I was gonna ask them out in a few days or something and it would jus feel sorta wrong to do that as well.

c3ptz6	2019-06-22 13:41:46	heyonnaise	AITA for not disinviting my uncle to my wedding after he made a dumb “racist” joke?	"I am getting married in 7 months. Invites aren’t out yet but the guest list is almost done. 

My side of the family is not what most would call “classy”. Instead they are like Canadian rednecks. They’re from a small town with minimal exposure to POC. 

On the other hand, my fiancee’s family is quite cosmopolitan and wealthy. She is also half-Chinese. When I first introduced her to my family, they were nice but didn’t seem to know how to act around her. For many of them, it was their first time seeing an Asian person in real life. Of course, dumb questions were asked and some comments made, but overall they liked her a lot and were welcoming.

I am very close to my uncle, who is my mother’s brother. Ever since my mother passed when I was 12, he has always been there for me. He can be a bit rough around the edges but overall he means well and has a good heart.

Yesterday, he and my aunt came down to the city to visit us. My fiancee and I went to dinner at a Chinese restaurant. My fiancee, who is fluent in Mandarin, ordered things for us. After the waitress left, my uncle joked, “Did you tell her not to put any dogs in our food?”

My fiancee was quite annoyed and replied, “Why should I ask that?” 
My uncle mumbled something about how it was a joke that “Chinese people eat dogs” and my fiancee replied, “I suppose some do. But how is it any different from eating cows or pigs?.” 

The conversation was quite awkward after that. My uncle apologized for his joke at the end of the meal, said that he loves Chinese food and was just trying to lighten up the mood. 

After in the car, when it was my fiancee and me, she said, “Well I’m seriously reconsidering letting him come to our wedding.” I was aghast and said he just made a stupid joke, like it’s pretty tame compared to the things his peers have said. She said that many of her guests will be POC, and if he can’t behave himself around them then perhaps he shouldn’t come. 

I said he’s basically like a second father to me, no way I would disinvite him over a dumb joke. He even apologized at the end.

I go outside to check it out, and the tech had hooked up a hose and was running my water. I called out to him and just said ""hey man... that's my water..."". I then turned the water off, unscrewed the hose, and handed it back to him. He mumbled a ""sorry sir"" as I made my way back inside.

This morning we miscommunicated again. Last evening my mum told me that she really wanted to sleep in, and asked me to be as silent as possible when I would get up for work. Because of this I was really suprised when I saw her entering the kitchen at 7:30. Confused and suprised at the same time I asked: 'What are you doing here?' Ofcourse I meant that as in 'I didn't expect you to be already up at this hour.'

&#x200B;

Unfortunately she took it as a personal attack. She screamed 'that she was already up because she had a lot of things to do', before slamming the door and storming off upstairs.

About 15 minutes later she comes back and says she expects me to walk our dog this morning and making bread before returning upstairs.  You see, I considered this was kind of a shitty thing to ask because she knew that I had to leave for work in about 30 minutes. Anyways, I quickly do what she had asked me to do and leave for work.

I feel like I should apologize and explain my saying as soon as I'm home, but I also don't really want to.

I (21M,Home for the summer from college.) Made myself breakfast this morning, I tend to be the one cooking or any interest in cooking in my household, I have two siblings (19M) and (14f)

While I was making breakfast my youngest sister came out of her room on her cell phone and just lingered around the kitchen, she did'nt say ANYTHING to me just stared and walked around. I think 'whatever,she's probably just waiting for me to finish uo so she can make her own.'

 I finish up and take my food to my room, a few minutes later my mother comes in very angry asking 'why did'nt I cook breakfast? Why did I only cook for myself?'

I respond 'No one said anything, they just walked around the kitchen'

Mother 'That was very selfish of you you're the oldest you can cook for them""

Me:""They did'nt say anything!""

The argument basically repeated itself and now I'm in the hot seat. I would've totally cooked if I was asked to,If someone SAID something, There's about a million food options In our house for breakfast,So my siblings could've wanted the complete opposite of what I wanted.

Background: 
In my close circle, family and friends, I'm the organizer. Whether it be birthdays, wedding, graduations you name it I mostly plan and host them with my mom. That includes my own, everyear. I don't mind it as it allows my family to all get together and it's time that I truly enjoy and I know that it wouldn't get done if I didn't do it. 

WIBTA? 
On Monday I celebrated my 30th bday! I also just started a new job which is taking up alot of my time. As a result I asked my family to host my party and told my friends to just join as I wouldn't have time to plan another for friends. 
 My friend Julia (made up) offered to host mine and Brittany's (also made up) bdays at her house, we were born 2 days apart, stating she would organize everything and foot the bill. We both told her we wanted to participate in the bill as we both make more and wanted specifique - expensive - drinks. She insisted so we agreed on the condition that we brought our own drinks that way she would only have to provide the food. A couple days before the even my Husband tells me that shes created a text group with him and Brittany's husband proposing that she do the food shopping and they all split the bill. I was thoroughly confused since we had offered to do it and it doesn't make sens for our husbands to pay instead of us since ... you know we are married it's also our money. She also asked them not to tell us. The way I see it, she's making herself out to be a great friend by paying for a part of our party when she didnt even have to and went behind our backs to ask our husbands for money. It just strikes me as odd. And Britnnay and I ended up paying for the expensive drinks and 2/3rds of everything else. Which again it's not about the money it's about how she went about it. 
 Currently preparing for my big party with my family, which I've had to plan because no one else is available (whole different issue) and shes just messaged me saying that she can't come because she is going out to diner with her live in bf.

I used to write request fanfics on tumblr and one day I got a request that was “angst for this ship”. So, basing a short story on a story from the actual original work, I wrote about an immortal character having to watch his lover grow old and die. 

Finished it. Posted it. Went to bed. 

Cut to the next morning and I wake up to find my inbox full of messages telling me to delete the fic. Turns out, the actress who plays the character who died in my story found the fic and had a massive panic attack because of it. 

See, the actress and the character share the same first name and she was under the impression that I’d written it about her, not the character. 

Along with her tweets were a bunch of people calling me a psychopath for even writing such a story.

I freaked out. Deleted it. Apologised. Left the fandom. 

Thing is: that was almost three months ago and I still have panic attacks and feel physically ill if I see or hear anything to do with that fandom.

First issue is her phone. She talks to 5 or 6 guys I have never met and know nothing about. I have expressed that I would like to meet these guys, I think that’s reasonable.

She has also hung out with a few of them, but she always comes home to me, so I’m not worried.

But tonight has be torn between what she is saying is my controllingness and insecurities and me feeling valid in my thought.

Great day. Halfway through she says her friend rachell wants to go out tonight. I ask if this is a double date or girls night. She says Rachell and her boyfriend are fighting and not talking tonight, so it’ll just be rachell but I’m welcome.

I offer to stay home so they can have an girls night, and they can talk about Rachell’s and her longtime boyfriend problems.

I just ask that she lets me know she home to Rachell’s safely.

I hear from her a few times during the night, sweet things. I love you. I want to marry you. I miss you. That ended at 12:30. 

Most bars close at 1:30, a few at 3:00. So at 3:45 I message her to make sure she is home safe.

Nothing.

Text her friend later.

Nothing.

Hour later she tells me she is 45 mins away at the strip clubs.

I ask with who.

She says Rachell.

I ask just rachell, she says well Devin ended up coming out later.

I ask why she didn’t try and call me and invite me out at that point.

No answer.

I call her.

She doesn’t answer.

Eventually connect again via text and conversation went like this, that I was being insecure. That she isn’t my ex wife. Then I asked directly a few more times and the trickle truth came out, it was Devin and 4 guy friends and Rachell with her at the strip club.

I’m seriously in love with this women. I dream about marring her. Everything else in our life is wonderful. I just don’t feel like she validates my feelings and has become untrustworthy.

I don’t care if she has male friends, talks or goes out with them. I think it’s reasonable to meet them. 

I don’t care if she goes out and has a nice night without me. I just feel she should let me know she is safe, and I feel not alerting me that she was going to the club with guys is wildly inappropriate. If she would have invited me, or at least let me know, it would be one thing."		1	0

c3poqt	2019-06-22 13:27:09	Itseemedfunny	AITA for confronting a dog owner over her dog’s poop?	"Hi! I really thought I was in the right here but am now doubting myself. 

I live in an apartment complex with a really bad dog poop problem. Over by my building, there are no dog waste receptacles (despite a dumpster being there...) and no one picks up after their dogs. It’s like landmines out there. Couple that with the Florida rainy season and BOOM my pup has giardia. If you don’t know anything about it, it’s caused by fecal matter being ingested and it’s a bitch to get rid of. We’ve had to steam clean everything I own, bleach what couldn’t be steamed, give my dog a bath nearly every time she goes out, so on. As a result, I’m on a crusade against people just leaving their dogs waste around.

This morning, a woman was walking her pit mix in this spot where there are ALWAYS large piles of poop. The dog poops, and she walks away from it. I yelled at her, “Do you plan on picking that up? It’s disgusting and my dog got sick from it.” Well, she went off. Called me a racist white bitch, told me to go fuck myself, mind my own business. She said she was going to get poop bags out of her car??? I told her that I’ve seen her dog’s poop there multiple times and if she can afford to live in these apartments she can afford to keep poop bags on her, that it’s fucking nasty and that her leaving poop there is my business. She started walking towards me. I hopped in my car and went on my merry way to take my dog to daycare (her giardia is GONE but I’m terrified of it coming back!). On my way out, I saw her go inside. I don’t know if she picked it up or not.

My mom says I unnecessarily escalated it. My boyfriend says I should take it a step further and leave the shit all over her car next time she does it.

She was super angry guys. Did I overstep?

Edit: I yelled across the parking lot, not in her face. Leaving dog poop is definitely not allowed here - we have signage, constant emails and it’s in our lease.  It’s a nice apartment complex - I just don’t get it . As an aside, I just got home and the poop is still there so it’s definitely her dog.

I probably was a bit of an asshole going from 0-100 and making this woman my target. I’ve been super frustrated with this giardia - it literally monopolized my life for two weeks - and seeing someone be so careless just pissed me off. My boyfriend has been equally as affected so he’s just irritated. We have no plans to put the poop on her car. So, I guess I’m not an asshole but kind of one."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3pmt3	2019-06-22 13:21:45		AITA for reporting my friend to the academic judiciary?	"Normal disclaimers about throw away account and mobile user. TLDR at the end. 

This all takes place some time ago in my senior year of college at a large research university. I have this friend, Meredith, who was a research assistant (RA) for a professor, let’s call him Dr. Shepherd (they were not romantically involved but it fits the plot so let’s roll with it). Meredith was on a project where she was doing data entry for a study. Dr. Shepherd was known around the university as being fairly stringent and having high expectations of his undergrad RAs. 

Meredith confided in me that she was really stressed out because she couldn’t find some data. So in order to meet her deadline, she made up data that she then submitted to Dr. Shepherd for his study. 

I emailed Dr. Shepherd (who id never had as a professor) that I wanted to talk to him about his research. We met and I basically relayed to him what Meredith had told to me. He said he already knew and he’d tried to talk to her about it but he couldn’t bring it up directly because he didn’t have any proof. He thanked me for telling him and I was on my way. 

A little bit later he emailed me and asked if I’d be willing to write a statement for the academic judiciary, as he and his graduate student had decided to pursue the matter. He told me that I didn’t have to because I’d have to disclose my name. I wrote the statement anyways because I was almost graduated at that point. 

I don’t talk to Meredith any more from here on out but our mutual friend, Cristina, tells me that Meredith is saying that I betrayed her, how could I do that, etc. Interestingly, Meredith was telling people that the only reason that Dr. shepherd went to the academic judiciary is because I informed him over email so he was obligated to by the university (not true). She also never disclosed to Cristina what she had done and said that I reported her for cheating in class. Apparently, this triggered downward spiral in merediths mental health (I did know that she had mental health problems). 

Ultimately, Meredith has to complete an online course about academic dishonesty and it was expunged from her record. 

FWIW- we were both pre med students so at the time I felt a real need to stick by my ethics and academic integrity. 

So, Reddit, AITA for reporting my friend to her professor and ultimately getting her reported to the academic judiciary?

TLDR- friend falsified data, I tell the PI who decides to report her.

Edited to add- when she initially told me what she had done, I told her to tell Dr. shepherd that she couldn’t find the data and to ask for an extension while she worked on it. She told me that she had already submitted it and seemed adamant that she didn’t want to back track. Also the deadline that she told me about was months before she had told me what happened."

c3pmr7	2019-06-22 13:21:34	XYZai	AITA For not getting ice cream	"Before I get into the details I think it’s important to note that I was grounded at the time of this story.  The characters involved are as followed

Me: OP
Mom: Mom
Sister: Jen
Stepdad: John

So after Jen’s volleyball game we were all in a good mood because Jen’s team won. So we decided to celebrate by getting ice cream at Baskin Robins. When we got there I asked if I could get a soda, my mom said “no we’re here for ice cream” so I said I didn’t want anything. This was the conversation that happened:

Mom: Get some ice cream you wanted some before we came in

Me: I don’t anymore 

John: You’re just saying that because you can’t get soda

Me: I’m not hungry I don’t want any ice cream

Mom: seriously get some fucking ice cream, your being selfish and ruining Taaj’s celebration

At this point I’m kinda laughing because the situation is pretty funny she’s getting mad because I don’t want ice cream, she ends up getting me a small scoop of Vanilla which I refused to eat.

Mom: Eat it

Me: I’m not hungry

Mom: Eat it or I’m going to school with you tomorrow

She was serious about this, my stepdad has gone to school with me before. But it wasn’t as bad as I thought, no one made fun of me for it. But I know my mom wouldn’t be the same so I ate my ice cream.

After that my mom said I was acting selfish and bratty. Honestly I don’t think I was wrong

c3pm84	2019-06-22 13:20:05		AITA for getting uncomfortable with my mom asking me if my SO was pregnant?	"Hi, I'll try to keep it consise. First about the current living situation. I (24) live in Europe and am currently living with my parents and younger brother (moved back in to save money/mortgage while studying). I have a girlfriend (26) from abroad who is currently on a working holiday visa here (she can stay in work here for a year), so she's living with us. Note that I have a  strenuous relationship with my mom, and we get into fights more frequently than a family should. THis is more an issue of clashing personalities rather than her being unhappy with me as an adult. I am academically successful and am currently wrapping up a semester as a private tutor as well. I contribute financially at home too.

&#x200B;

Gf has been here for about a month, and we're still in the process of sorting it ID cards, tax cards and what not, and she still has some practical questions as well. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday during dinner we were talking about her insurance and how that would work with doctors/hospitals in case she wanted to check something. The day after, I'm home with my mom and younger brother, sitting in the living room talking to my brother. After not having participated in the conversatoin for \~10 odd minutes, she suddenly asks: ""SneakyCrit, is your GF pregnant?"" She based this on the fact that GF was asking about doctors and stuff the day before. 

&#x200B;

For me this was completely out of the blue and very uncomfortable, and I perceived it as a ""oh btw son, did you fuck up again?"" statement from her. What did she base this on? So a woman asks about the healthcare system after having lived here the first month of a year, and she must be pregnant? Does she not think that we are able to be on top of this ourselves?

&#x200B;

My brother left about 10 min later for the gym, and I confronted her about it. Tried to be calm about it, don't want to fight, told her it was uncomfortable and out of the blue. She defended her right to ask, I said sure, but maybe she shouldn't be so quick to think the worst thing may have happened. 

&#x200B;

I don't know if I am actually seeing a pattern of her wanting to spin up drama/think the worst of me or if I just want to see a pattern. Either way, what she said, in front of my brother no less, was very uncomfortable.

c3pjoi	2019-06-22 13:12:46		AITA for getting angry at my girlfriend for flaking?	"This is not a big deal but I'm pretty livid at her and just wondering if I'm overreacting? Sorry for the long story.

This happened yesterday but I haven't seen her yet to talk about it.

In the morning my mum asked me if I was around for dinner because my sister and her boyfriend (who live together and therefore I don't see as much) were going to come over for dinner. Obviously, I'm keen to see them and I had no plans so I said I'll be there. Mum also told me to ask my girlfriend if she wanted to come so I texted her right away (this was about 10am) and she said she would. My girlfriend is a very picky eater so this meant my mum had to change what she was making to accommodate her. My sister and her bf were coming at around 6.30 and we were going to eat around 7.

I went over to my girlfriends place afterwards to help her with stuff around the house. I asked her if she wanted to stay at mine (we live 30 minutes away) since she's coming over for dinner, but she said no because she wanted to see her friend in the morning who was going overseas that day. Fair enough, makes sense.

Around 6 she got a call from said friend and I heard my girlfriend say ""I'm going to \[my\] house for dinner... but idk about it"". I ignored it and didn't think anything of it. The stuff we were doing around the house was taking ages so I was still at hers by 6.30. I started to get ready to go around 6.45 and then she says that she doesn't really want to go anymore and I should just go. At this point I was already late and annoyed so I didn't fight it. She kept asking if I was upset she didn't want to go and I said no because I didn't have time to have a talk about it, and also I didn't want her to come if she didn't actually want to.

Then later in the night she posted on her insta story a picture of her at her friends house. I guess I'm annoyed that she flaked literally last minute when she obviously already knew she wanted to see her friend instead. She could have easily told me much earlier.

c3phei	2019-06-22 13:06:14	seven1five	AITA if I no longer want to be the maid of honour after getting kicked out of the house?	"I've moved from home the other side of the country two years ago. This year, at the end of March, I moved home and had nowhere to stay. My sister and her fiance (let's call them S and F; also not engaged yet) have a spare room and let me stay with them in F's house. I was paying rent to them weekly. While there, I was living my own life - managing my own groceries, laundry, etc. If we decided to eat out, we would take turns paying.


A few days later, SF got engaged. S asked me to be her maid of honour for March 2020 after telling her that I didn't want to be part of another bridal party. I decided to do it for her even though we aren't close but she's family.


I gained my permanent residency around mid-May (a very big deal to me - been working towards this for the past 10 years) and decided to celebrate. I invited SF, my work mates and their respective partners to come for dinner. Everyone came along but SF. S said she didn't want to go because it will be so awkward for SF not knowing anyone.


Two days later, SF have their engagement party. My parents are based overseas and I'm the only immediate family member she has there. F has his parents and three sisters. All of them invite their friends along while I was not able to. I attended for S knowing that I will barely know any of the 100+ people there. Needless to say, I left after starting to feel uncomfortable when the familiar faces I knew retired early for the night. Hours later, I picked SF up from the pub (the afterparty) and dropped F's mates home as well.


Last night, I drove S to pick up F from the pub. F may have been drunk. On the way back, I took a turn too sharply and the rear wheel mounted the corner of a curb briefly. F proceeds to continuously carry on about how I'm a dangerous driver. I pull over and said if I was such a dangerous driver then he can get out of the car. F brings up the fact I'm currently staying at his house and where else would I be if not there. I said I have people who I can stay with which he then proceeds to threaten saying it will be my last night there. He gets out of the car and walks the 500m back. I call out to him to get back in the car but he kept on walking, so I drove off. On his walk back, he texts saying I am to be out of the house next week. This wasn't this first time F has threatened me with this. I was sick of constant insecurity of not having a place to stay and the lack of support from S that I packed a bag and left last night. I get a text from F to come back as I was packing the car to leave, but nothing from S. Made the hour drive at 11pm to a colleagues place to stay until I can find a place of my own. They stayed up waiting for me and was welcomed with a very warm hug. 


As for today, only received a text from S asking where I was and nothing from F."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3pgxc	2019-06-22 13:04:53	orangelimericks	AITA for telling my coworker about the gossip in our office that she is having an affair?	"For some time now, there has been gossip in our office about two of my coworkers (I’ll call them Allen and Alice) who, for some of our other coworkers (I’ll call them Susans) are too close for comfort. Both Allen and Alice are married. I stayed out of it because I personally thought that they’re just more comfortable with each other since they come from the same home town, plus the things they do that my coworkers find suspect honestly seem harmless to me.

We all used to be part of the same team, but last year our team was split into two, with Allen leading Team A and Alice leading team B which I and the Susans are part of. Allen and his team transferred to another floor, but he continued to be close to Alice. When one of his clients gifted him a weekend stay for his team at a resort the client owns, he invited Alice to go with them. Alice said that our team mates might feel hurt that she was invited and they were not, so Allen extended the invitation to our team as well. The Susans happily accepted and we all spent a fun weekend at the client’s resort.

When we got back to the office last Monday, the Susans were talking about Allen and Alice again, and the gossip was a lot worse. Apparently, some people saw some things happen during our stay at the resort. This made me angry because we had just been to a vacation thanks to Alice and Allen, and here are these people gossiping about them. I spoke up and told the Susans that if Allen and Alice were having an affair, then why would they do anything during a vacation with coworkers when they could just meet up somewhere without anyone knowing.

I don’t know what I was thinking, but before I went home I decided to talk to Alice and finally told her about the gossip about her and Allen. She looked surprised and saddened, but she thanked me and said she appreciates that I told her.

On Tuesday I learned that she filed for a two week leave and will not be back until July. The Susans don’t know what I told Alice and are talking about possible reasons for her leave. I sent Alice a message saying that I hope she’s doing fine, she replied with thank you but asked that I not contact her until she is back.

I told my husband what happened. He said that I should’ve stopped at telling the Susans off and that I shouldn’t have gone to Alice. He said that my anger at the Susans made me insensitive to how telling Alice about the gossip could affect her, and her relationship with everyone in our office. He said that telling her just made the situation worse, regardless if the gossip is true or not. Now that Alice knows that her coworkers are talking about/have talked about her and Allen, there is no chance that the issue will just quietly go away on its own. She will always be conscious about her friendship with Allen and her relationship with us, her coworkers.

I think “we’ll ok, whatever” and just sit down. These people were chatting it off in the ads which I didn’t mind but when the movie started I politely asked them to stop. They stopped for 5 minutes and started again. I asked again and they talked again. Annoyed, I plotted my revenge. I waited until about midway through run time, got my second ticket, out on my phone torch and told the guy to leave my seat or I’m gonna tell staff. Annoyed he gets up and actually sits almost all the way up the front where it’s really hard to see the screen because your so close, he must have booked late or seperate idk. I pull up the arm rest and sit in between 2 seats and tell the rest of the group “maybe you should listen next time”. I was satisfied with my revenge. I tell other friends as I was impressed with myself, not gonna lie and they called me assholes saying I shouldn’t have done it mid movie. I’m still laughing at the dirty looks they gave me at the end.

Edit: I feel like some people think I literally stood up and banished this dude. We were sitting in the back row and I was on an aisle seat so he only had to squeeze pass me anyway.

"I work in a fast food restaurant and am experienced enough that I'm responsible for training some of our new recruits. As anyone who has worked in fast food will be aware, we have people of all shapes and sized and from all walks of life working here, but one of our new recruits is being a bit of a pain. Her name is Megan. 

I could see she wasn't our usual type as soon as she walked in. She was very pretty and very well spoken, and seemed fairly nice on her first day. However, within her first week she proved to be very lazy. She was constantly at the back chatting to some of the other girls or flirting with the guys in the kitchen. She was OK with the cashier work but if I asked her to do something like sweep/mop the floor she'd ''Ugh'' and give me a dirty look, but she had no choice but to get it done. 

I did some digging on her. Googled her name and the first thing that came up was her linked in profile. She's been to one of the best unis and had a job doing financial stuff for some big company. I wondered why someone that smart with a career like that would end up working here. 

I chatted to one of the other girls to see what she knew about Megan. Apparently she was fired because she turned up to work blatantly under the influence of drugs. She was tested, and as a result was not only fired but also blacklisted from the profession with her specialist certifications voided. According to Amy (the girl I spoke to) her parents made her get this job by threatening to kick her out.

Yesterday Megan kicked off at me in the crew room for making her mop the floor again. I didn't understand what the problem was but she kept saying that I only made her do it because I was too lazy to do it myself. That isn't true at all and I kept trying to tell her that I had to both do my own work and ensure that she gets the right training. She then tried to get at me by saying that in a few months she'd be gone and I'd still be here. We argued for a bit until she said that she wouldn't apologise for being prettier and smarter and more successful than me so I should ''get off my high horse''. I responded that if she was so smart then she shouldn't have gone and ruined her own career. 

Once I said this she got upset and went off to get changed. Her shift was over but when she stepped out she was clearly crying. When she was gone some of the others in the room started to get at me saying I shouldn't have brought up her previous job and that she's new so shouldn't be thrown in at the deep end. 

I don't regret standing up for myself against her but I think bringing up her last job was a low blow?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

After my grandma passed away my aunt moved in with my grandfather to take care of him, she's 65 yo,  and retired she had time on her hand.

After a while she started complaining about how hard it is, because my grandpa gets really cranky if you do not follow his every command, sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night yelling that he's hungry,  so she has to prepare a meal for him (he often eats 6 to 8 times a day because he Forgets that he has eaten) 
So i decided to move in with her to help her with the chores / groceries and handiwork 

I'm 22 and a 3rd year University student 
My university is closer to my grandparents house so i figured why not 


But these last few months it gotten way worse,to the point that he no longer can go to the bathroom himself, he always gets lost if he goes out (if we don't let him go out he starts hitting his face and screaming), he hides his stuff away (his cane, shoes,hats)and accuses us that we stole them.

Last week my aunt got with and argument with him,  he woke us up at 3 am saying that he didn't eat in 2 days and we are letting him starve,he started calling us names especially my aunt, she couldn't handle it anymore so she packed he stuff and moved back to her home,  she told my mother that they better put him in a facility because she can't handle him anymore, my mom freaked out saying that she'll never put her father in such a place, in wich my aunt responded ""then you take care of him"".

My mom works 9 to 5 so obviously she can't,  i asked her to hire someone to take care of him, but she responded ""why would we hire someone when you can take care of him"" 
I jokingly said ""ok let me drop out for the University so I can take care of him"" 
To wich she responded with ""obviously"". 

I couldn't believe what she said,  she even called my uncles (they live abroad)  to tell that I'll be taking care of grandpa, i stormed into her room and we started arguing her argument is that he's my grandpa so i should naturally take care of him, or she'll cut me off ( she gives me around 30$ monthly,  a cup of coffee cost on average 1$ in my country ) , I just packed my stuff and left. 

The day after, my uncles called me,  they told me that they spoke to my mother and are willing to pay me to take of him, i said that under no circumstances that I'm willing to drop out and they should just put him in a facility for alzheimer's patients, they started calling me names so i just hang up.

Anyways, current boyfriend and I have been in a pretty healthy relationship for 3 years now. We have our ups and downs just like everyone else but we can work through things I feel like. We don’t live together and we both work a lot though, so the time we spend together is very limited. 

A few months ago he told me that he’s had suspicions of me cheating because I’m always on my phone. I am really bad about being on my phone all the time, and I know I need to stop using it as a crutch for anxiety. 

So with me always being on my phone, I’m typically browsing social media or reddit and I see things that i like so I show him. But every time I show him something, I hold my phone out in a way that he can just look at what I’m showing him without grabbing it.  But every time I do he grabs my phone and looks at whatever I’m showing him for at least a minute, even if it’s just a meme with like 10 words, he supposedly “can’t read it with me holding it.”

It just makes me really uncomfortable and I’ve told him about my ex and the phone situation. It just makes me really anxious when anyone has my phone. I’ve told him this and he still does it. 

I don’t ever touch his phone. I don’t know his password, I don’t read his messages, etc. because I trust him enough to not go through his personal conversations. But he has tried to read mine before and tried to get in my phone. It really bothers me. I’m not cheating and have nothing to hide but I’m afraid he’s going to actively try and find something to get mad about, whether it’s messages to close friends, something out of context... you get the idea."

"So I'm in a fresh Dungeons and dragons campaign that is only two sessions in with 5 players. It's been extremely hard to get everyone to have a free night at least once every two weeks for this campaign. Then yesterday, my DM(Dungeon Master) says to the chat we're all in that he's invited one of his friends that we've never met before to join us in the next session and asks if that's cool with us.

 Now I say ""It should be fine as a guest for one session. But any longer and we'd have to rely on another person and therefore get less sessions if he isn't available"". He said ""yeah, one sesh to hang"". But then he tells the group an hour later that the same guy is bringing his girlfriend as well. I ask if it's still just the next session and he replied with ""They're new to the game and I was keen to maybe get them in for a few"". 

I immediately tell him along with another player to get them seriously prepped before we start the next session because I don't want to wait around for hours for them to build their character sheet on the day. The DM's girlfriend tells us to ""chill out a tad. It's meant to be fun""
Guys....AITA?

Disclaimer: I'm cautious because in the last campaign someone brought their friend to join an already packed campaign and it was too hard to get everybody in the same place at the same time. So people eventually lost interest and the campaign was cancelled. So I'm afraid it's going to happen again just because my DM can't help himself."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3p0iu	2019-06-22 12:14:28	thisisanalt01	AITA for not covering my tattoo	"Alt, obviously. 

I had a dog. A pitbull more specifically. Her name was Tora. She passed away peacfully last year. I've had a small tattoo of her face on my wrist for at least four years. Tora was the love of my life. I poured everything into that dog, her being the first pet I've ever owned. She was great, amazing temperament, just an all around good dog. 

About two years ago, my sister and her 6 year old were over at my house. Six year old was playing with my dog in the front yard, sister and I were sitting on the porch talking and watching. I had forgotten to put on Tora's shock collar, the one that kept her in the yard. Now she was usually great at staying in the yard but I got it so when she saw a rabbit or other small animals, she didn't run across the street to get them. Well, seeing as I had forgotten it, she just so happened to see a squirrel and bolt across the road. Unfortunately, the six year old ran after her. It all happened in slow motion and honestly, it was horrible. A car pulled out and slammed into the six year old, nearly missing my dog. I don't want to go into depth but he was pretty badly injured, not enough to still be effected in the future, but enough to rack up a costly hospital bill. I helped my sister pay it and apologised proufously. Ever since that incident she has despised Tora and wanted her put down. I told her she was ridiculous and I refused. She basically cut ties with me. 

Well recently, she's been slowly coming back into my life. Which is great, I adore my nephew. But she constantly makes remarks about my tattoo and how I should get it covered because it brings up horrible memories for her and she hated that I was remembering a dog that put her son in harm's way. I refused and she called me an asshole. Am I?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3p089	2019-06-22 12:13:35		WIBTA if I don’t let my mums dog inside when I am home alone?	"I still live with my parents part time, but am planning to move out with my partner when I get the chance to do so. I’m not at mums and dads house most of the week and have been doing this for a while now. Close to a year.

My mum currently owns a 1 and a 1/2 year old American Staffy who she “trained” as an inside dog. She went and got it herself without consulting other family members (me and dad) about 1 year ago. This decision is a strong reason to why I want to move out.

I cannot get along with this pet and it doesn’t like me or my dad, it barely listens to mum too. She hasn’t been able to take care of all of this pets needs, reducing its ability to do the zoomies because of x y z and not being able to take it for a walk because she can barely walk without something pulling her along.

Mum went and got this pet because our other family dogs were killed when they escaped one night (black lab + golden retriever, both hit and ran over by a train) and she can’t deal with not having a dog at the house. I’ve lived at this house my whole life and all dogs we owned were outside dogs as we have birds and fish indoors. We still do.

Mum has asked me to bring her in when I am home from work and she or dad isn’t home, but the last thing I want to do is babysit a pet when I’ve just got home after working a long day (I legit just want to sleep now but want to know the answer for this before doing so) on the weekend cause she went out (I have been at work since 8:45am today and just finished at 9:30pm. Split shift like hours between two different jobs)

Bringing pet inside means I need to watch her as she gets up to mischief as well. Until mum gets home. This has been all the way until 2am which doesn’t work because on the next day I tend to have to do a repeat of the previous day (8-9 am start and 11-1 am/pm finish for job 1 and 3pm start and 8-9:30pm finish for job 2 every weekend day)

c3oxem	2019-06-22 12:04:58	WIBTAAccount111	WIBTA (for my dad), if he stops giving our grandma money for groceries?	"Hey AITA community,

I'm posting this in behalf of my dad. He cannot speak english. Sorry for some spelling mistakes.

 
My grandma (74y) has two sons and her husband died 6 years ago. She didn't work for most of her life and because of that, she has a low pension in our country. She's a hoarder, buys stuff she doesn't need, if she has the money for it.

So, as for the reason my dad wants to stop giving her money:
My dad buys our grandma groceries & stuff she really needs biweekly, while our uncle gives her about 50 - 60 € biweekly, so she can buy herself the neccessities for the other week. My dad always paid about 50 € every time and she had enough food for the whole week. Lately she took more and more groceries every time my dad went with her shopping. My dad asked her before, why she needs it and she said something like ""I need it, because I'm always so hungry"". My dad said ok. Now he pays about 100 € biweekly and sometimes she calls mid-week and asks, if we can buy this and that.
He asked her what she buys with the money, my uncle gives her. She said it's for the groceries. 

Lately she has something with her foot and cannot go to the store alone and needs help. My uncle took her to the grocery store and she only bought groceries for about 10 €. He asked her why only this much for a whole week and she answered with ""I've got enough stuff from the week before"". Now my uncle told my dad, that he buys her groceries for both weeks and my uncle doesn't know what she does with the money he gives her every other week.

My dad is a little bit mad, because 200+ € a month is really much for our family and he doesn't know what to do. If my dad starts giving her money like our uncle, our grandma will buy useless stuff and won't buy herself many groceries. He told her once before, she can only buy for about 50 €, she got mad at him and said something like ""You don't care for your mother and I need food to survive"".

Would my dad be an asshole, if he stops giving her money for a specific amount of time?

I personally know, it won't help much, because she will try to be sneakier than before. 




tl;dr Our grandma gets money from our uncle and groceries from us biweekly and she started to take more groceries and uses the money from my uncle for useless stuff.





Edit: I forgot to write, we tried it before to buy her grocieres and deliver it to her. She calls my dad/our uncle she needs more/different stuff.
Also my family/uncle's family are speaking well to each other, because of reasons and my uncle won't give my dad the money for my grandma, if he goes shopping with her every weekend."	No A-holes here	0	0
c3ow4z	2019-06-22 12:01:18	cherryseok	AITA for exposing an ex-friend’s text messages to my friend?	"EDIT: It was requested that I add a character section, so here it is, complete with fake names: Everyone involved is under the age of eighteen. N can be referred to as Nathaniel, and is male, along with R (Remy), K (Khris), and myself. S (Samantha) and D (Dominique) are female, with D being the eldest of all of us. At the moment, sides in this situation are K, N, S, and D, with R and I being on the other side.

A bit of background: almost a year ago I was added to an Instagram groupchat with a few other people whom I had gotten to know over the months. Two of them were boyfriends (K and R), and we all became amazing friends with each other. Whenever there was an issue with someone in the chat, whom I will refer to as N, he would come to me and tell me, and we would try to fix it. There were never any long lasting problems.

A short while ago, K and R broke up. It seemed R was not taking it very well, and left the groupchat, venting in both his posts and private story. Both N and I would try to help R the best we could while still maintaining our relationship with other members of the chat. N then started showing the groupchat private screenshots of his conversation with R, complaining of some of the things he had said. Other members of the chat, such as D and S, would then continue to bash R in the chat where he couldn’t see because he had left.

This went on for a while, N still saying he was best friends with R while saying things about him where he couldn’t see that were beyond hurtful. A bit afterward, K and N started dating, and seemed to bond over the consistent hatred of R that they could have kept private.

I decided I would report the things N was saying to R. R had already known from his ex-boyfriend, K, that N had been speaking less than highly of his self-proclaimed best friend. When he found out from me, he took the screenshots I had sent him and cropped them so nobody could see the messages I had sent, and sent them back to N himself. This sparked an investigation where everyone bared their conversations to prove they had not sent the screenshots to R. I showed them everything willingly, including my camera roll and recently deleted, so they could not determine that it was me. They spat venom at whomever was the designated “rat” in the chat, which is why I hid my involvement in the affair.

Yesterday, I left the chat, saying I needed a mental health break. My follower count proceeded to drop, and I found that it was because one by one, S, N, and finally K had blocked me. After presenting the situation to two other friends, they determined that I was not the asshole in the scenario, as I was just sticking up for my friend.

So, AITA for reporting to my friend that he was being talked about in an unsavoury way?"		0	0

c3osnx	2019-06-22 11:49:41		AITA for not liking my friends meeting up without inviting me?	"I have recently started a new job in a new city where I have quickly become good friends with the other +/- 25 people that started at this organisation at the same time as me. We often go out for a drink together and generally hang out a lot. 

I live together with my long-time best friend. We have lived together for some years, have many shared friends and spend almost all of our time together. I also introduced him to my new colleagues and they got along well.

Now last weekend, one of my colleagues invited my friend for a drink without asking me if I already had plans or if I might want to come too.  As it happens I was actually not feeling well and decided to stay home and rest, but she didn't know that. The idea that she was making plans with my friend, who she only knows through me and knows is also my roommate, without even considering to extend the invitation to me too did not sit well with me. 

I told my friend the next day that I did not really appreciate him meeting with my colleague without either of them even asking if I might me interested in joining too. Not in an angry way, just to let him know for future reference that it had made me feel a bit left out. Now he knew I was a bit sick and wasn't up for going out anyway, so I can actually understand that he didn't invite me.

I also mentioned the same thing to my colleague, again not in an angry/accusing way at all, and she only told me she was very surprised to hear this. She didn't really seem to understand why her actions had bothered me and I feel like both of them think I am overreacting about this.

So now the question to you, redditors, is: Am I the asshole, or rather, am I overreacting here, by being bothered by this? Should I have handled this differently?"		1	0

c3os52	2019-06-22 11:47:57	REDDIT_APP_IS_TRASH	AITA for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though I don't need it?	"I hate flying to the point that I will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. It's not that I'm scared of flying, I just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

So I only fly if I can buy a second seat (or third if I'm flying with my wife). It lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. Also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class AND for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. I'm a big guy but I 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

On multiple flights I've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no I bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

AITA for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? If I was willing to fly with one seat I wouldn't have bought a second seat.

Note - I do not take two seats on the train/bus EVER. They are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so I don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3opqm	2019-06-22 11:39:45	throw_yawa123	AITA for stealing a trespasser's bottles?	"**Background**

I live in an apartment in a house. There are 12 apartments in the house (it's big). There is an alley that contains the garbage and recycling bins. The garbage bin alley is wide, and is shared with the neighbouring lowrise (30 apartments) they keep their bins on their side of the garbage alley. My bedroom window faces the alley. Noise in this alley echos and bounces like crazy right into my windows. It usually doesn't bug me. 

In my city, you can take your liquor and beer empties to the bottle depot and get 10-20 cents for each. Lots of people in the city go into people's yards and rummage through their bins collecting discarded empties so they can take them back and make a few bucks. 
For these bottle scavengers, ours is a popular alley to stop in since in one area you can rummage through the bins of 42 tenants from the two properties combined, guaranteed to score a couple of cans. I'm fine with this. Usually. 

**The incident**

One man comes every night between 4-4:30 am with a shoping cart. The cart is LOUD. CLANGITY CLANGITY CLANG of the metal cart rattling on the uneven pavement ""CLINKITY CLINKITY CLANK"" of the glass bottles bouncing around in the cart. THUMP, THUD, RUSTLE of the bin lids opening and closing. There are 16 bins total in the alley for him to open and close. I've been hearing him for 1 year. 
I look out the window, I see he is trying his best to be quiet, but this is not a task that you can physically be quiet doing. You can be ""quieter"" but never quiet. Especially that fucking shopping cart. 

Recently I finally had enough. I got my ass dressed (I sleep naked), and went outside and asked him to please stop coming at 4am. Our laws say that you can make noise at 7am, please start coming at 7am. He apologized. Next day, 4am. He is back. I get dressed, go out. I tell him he is selfish and rude. I tell him he isn't even a tenant here so he should respect other people's space, especially when I politely asked him the previous day to stop. He apologized. 

The next day he is back. I'm furious. I get dressed, grab a grocery bag, go out, walk by him without a word (he was ready to apologize again), and I go to his shopping cart. Angrily, I load up my shopping bag with about a dozen of his bottles $2.40 value). I turn around and say ""You just won't listen to me. Thanks for the bottles. See you tomorrow.""
I march back inside with his bottles. 

Later in the day I put the bottles on the curb for someone else to find. 

My GF says I was an asshole. I'm not going to assault the guy, and words won't work with him. I think it was justified. I haven't heard him for a week. 

I should state that personally, I always put my empties on the curb, not in the bin so that the scavengers will find them more easily (and to reduce traffic in the alley). I can't control the 40 other neighbours, they put empties in the bin. The bottle depot is inconveniently located so nobody bothers taking them to the depot themselves, the scavengers can have at 'em.

c3onmj	2019-06-22 11:32:24		AITA for being jealous in this situation?	Hello there! I am going to try and keep it short. My bf has a couple of female friends who write him every now and then. Now, that's not the problem at all. They are decent people and all. Here's the issue with the whole situation. Before I could get closer to him, he was OBSESSED with one of the girls he still texts, like literally obsessed over her. Back then I was only a,, close friend '' of his and helped out with problems and similar. What annoyed me a lot was that he always talked about her, when I say always I mean basically the whole day when we were talking/texting.,, Did you know she... '',, she is having this and this problem'',, how do I tell her I like her?'' kinda stuff. She turned him down politely and he was heartbroken, couldn't talk about anything else but her. It was sucking the life out of me because at that point I was already in love with him. And hearing about another girl while you're in love with a man? Not very nice and hella depressing to be frank. I never said anything to him, kept quiet, helping him through this, being a good friend. One day I decided it was enough and told him I was in love with him, he took it very weirdly but after a while, he told me that he also liked me a lot  (reason was that I helped him through though times) and tada, we became a couple, I moved in with him after a few months. Everything was okay, couldn't complain really. The other girl he texts (We'll call her Tina) is quite open about her interests in men. She has sent him nudes before (we were already quite close when that happened) he told me, turned her down, telling her to please not do it again. Alright, all nice and well. He still texts both of them frequently (which means everyday) and almost doesn't listen when he is deep in the conversation they're having. I probably could tell him I was pregnant and he'd be like,, Aha, that's nice dear.'' So, AITA for being  a slight bit jealous when this happens?		1	0

Before then she took MDMA and promised me to never take again.

Today, she got a call from her friend asking her to take MDMA with her next weekend at a club. She consulted me about it and asked me if I'm fine with her taking it if we halve the pill, I take one half she takes the other. Obviously I got really pissed off that she'd even consider that, despite knowing my views on it. She continued to push a little harder. So getting lost in my emotions I told her it's either me or the drugs. And I get it, ultimatums are fucking terrible to put someone through. But this is about drugs. And I don't care if it's not a hard drug, it's still a drug and I do not want to see another loved one take drugs. She knows that and promised me to never do it again.

She told me she's not going to take it but she's mad at me for making her choose between drugs and me.

I can't understand why I'd be the asshole for not wanting my girlfriend to take drugs, and being honest and telling her that there's no way I'm going to be with her if she takes it.

So this is my first time posting here, but I'd thought it might be worth a read. Plus I need to get this off my chest.

I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend (bf) for nearly 4 years, and it's had it's ups and downs. I'm not exactly the most mentally stable person. I feel down a lot, a tend to go very quiet if I'm upset. If I'm pushed to talk, I snap at people, so I guess I'm kind of an asshole there, but that's not the story.

So the past few days I just haven't been getting along with bf because he has hardly been talking or acknowledging anything I say. Yes, it sounds petty, but he is my only friend, I don't have anyone else. Anyway, I was upset and asked for him to leave me alone, and for a few hours, he did.

I went to work, had to comfort my manager for something personal (that's another story for another day), so I had basically used up all my emotional energy. It was like I was on auto pilot for the next 7 hours. By the time I had finished my night shift, I got a Snapchat off bf telling me to continue his 625 day streak with him because he didn't want it die. By this point I had had enough of him and said I did not care.

Then he said, ""If you cared about this relationship and send me just a quick picture, which would show you love me. Does that mean nothing?""  Again, I said no and now he thinks our relationship doesn't matter.

He's being so ridiculous, but am I an asshole for not wanting to Snap back? I'm also really questioning this relationship if a number is so important."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3ojlz	2019-06-22 11:18:33	RINGTHROWAWAY2468	AITA for taking my deceased grandmother’s ring?	"My grandmother passed away Thursday night and she left a few things behind. One of those things was a ring that was passed down from her grandmother to her mother then her because she is the oldest granddaughter. My grandmother had the same rule. The oldest daughter gets it then passes it down to her oldest daughter.

Everything was fine and I was looking forward to this because it really is a beautiful ring and I’d occasionally pick it up out of her jewelry box to look at it when I was over at her house. The ring means a lot to me and it’s the only thing I wanted of hers. Back when I was 14, my aunt adopted a 17 year old girl. At the time everything was discussed prior to the adoption (when I was 11), my aunt and her husband only had 2 sons. She told my mom that even though she was the oldest, she wanted my mom to get it then pass it down to me, as she didn’t have any daughters. **My grandmother agreed it was the sensible thing to do and told me I could have the ring.** My mom doesn’t wear jewelry though, so she didn’t care much either way. My mom told me she’d just give it to me when she got it. For reference, I am 21 now and this adopted “cousin” is 24. I am the oldest biological granddaughter.

While everyone was cleaning out different rooms yesterday after my grandmother’s passing (She had Alzheimer’s and was moved to a facility but her home was still cluttered, that’s why we were cleaning out her house so soon after her passing. She also wanted to be cremated and has no living relatives other than her children and grandchildren so we weren’t concerned about planning a funeral), I heard my aunt and her adopted daughter in the pantry talking about how she was going to sneak the ring out of the jewelry box before I could get it since *she* is the oldest granddaughter. I was upset because my aunt promised me I could eventually have it but she changed her mind.

We all went out last night to eat after finishing up some work (we plan on doing a lot of cleaning today too) and I left early and told them that my manager texted me and asked me to come work for a few hours because a co-worker had called off sick and they were swamped. I went straight back to my grandmother’s house and took the ring out and left before anyone could come back. I took it to my apartment and hid it just to be safe. I have no idea what will happen today when my aunt realizes it’s missing.


Edit: My grandmother never said otherwise after the adoption.

**Alright folks, here is what the will says now that I have seen it:**

I bequeath the following items of tangible personal property to the beneficiaries listed below:

Diamond ring inherited from my grandmother: My eldest daughter who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter. *If she should not bear daughters, it shall be given to my youngest daughter instead who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter.*

**There you go. It belongs to ME. Apparently blood ties were important to my grandmother as well since step and adopted grandkids aren’t included. The will was made several years ago after my grandfather passed away and she wanted to have it made just in case something happened to her, before my aunt and my mom had children. It is likely my grandmother simply didn’t remember the will since she had Alzheimer’s.**

Edit: Maybe this edit will make you all chill out. I didn’t know there was a will. I based it off words that had been said to me. That’s why I took it. My grandmother and I were **EXTREMELY** close. I felt it was mine since it had been promised to me and was offended that there was an attempt to actually take it away from me. My mother called me and told me that we were meeting up at my grandmother’s house once again to look over the will she made several years ago. I showed up and my aunt and her daughter (I took *adopted* out since that seems to trigger a lot of you) did as well. They looked very tired and annoyed. When we were reading the will and it came out that my mother is the owner of the ring, my aunt and her daughter began screaming at us and admitted that they were there from 11 PM until 2 AM looking for the ring thinking it had gotten lost somewhere but couldn’t find it. Since my aunt has no biological daughters, it immediately transferred ownership to my mother and she said it now belongs to me because she does not want it since she doesn’t wear jewelry. I told my mom that I already took it and she was upset until I said I overheard my aunt talking to her daughter about how they were going to snatch it up before anyone else got to it. My aunt got pissed with me and told me to never talk to her again. She and her daughter left in tears and told us to finish cleaning up on our own. The ring was the only thing left to me and it was truly the only thing I wanted, so I’m happy I got it. So here I am now, cleaning up the house again with my mom.

**LAST EDIT:** I didn’t fucking come here to be judged about my opinion on blood ties. I came here to be judged about my ACTIONS - whether or not taking the fucking ring was an asshole move on my end. 

It seems most of you don’t realize how simple it truly is the execute a will. The lawyer who helped her was there with us with it in hand - she wanted to ensure it wouldn’t be lost so she kept it stored away. It doesn’t take a year and a half after the death of someone to look at the fucking will to see what the deceased is giving to someone else. My god. 

The ring that is now mine has currently been in the family for 5 generations. And yes, that does matter. Why the hell should someone who was adopted into the family at 17 (my aunt and uncle have had her since she was 16 and my grandmother already had Alzheimer’s) who has no blood ties to the family get the ring instead of the biological descendants??? Explain to me how the hell my “cousin” and I are equal in this instance. She and my grandmother were *not* close. **I** was the one who visited her every day before she entered the facility to help her with chores around the house, not her. And no, I don’t treat her differently but I do view her differently. 

And no, my aunt can’t have any biological children now. She had a hysterectomy several years ago."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3ojjp	2019-06-22 11:18:21	owltrowel618	AITA for my work ethic at my internship?	"I'm (21F) 6 months into an unpaid internship. Office is understaffed but the daily target is still reached and I know I contribute a lot to that. I'm assigned to Ann (40sF) but I end up mostly reporting to Pam (40sf), another manager in the office as Ann doesn't always have work for me. 

My question is to do with issues with Pam. It was my birthday recently and I asked to leave early, but only after getting my work done and asking if it's fine in advance. Because of visiting relatives, my family insisted I also take the next day off. No fight from me. The only day off I had was due to getting sick.

So before leaving, I ask Ann if I could have the next day off unless she needed me in for work. Ann said sure but check if Pam may need me, which I was going to do anyway. Went up to Pam and told her that I'd asked Ann for the day off (Pam repeatedly says that I'm still Ann's intern whenever we're talking about work, which is why I mentioned that first) but if she needed me to come in then I'll do that. Pam says, ""No it's okay, we'll manage!""

I stay home but stay in touch to see how the work is and see that they are reaching the target just fine without my help so I'm relaxed. But when I come in the next day, Pam starts making jibes about me taking a ""holiday"" and turns to my desk mate and says, ""You know what she did? She asked Ann first about taking a day off and then just told me!"" I respond that I asked if she would need help and that I would stay but then she just says, ""Yeah yeah, try asking Ann for the day off when SHE needs you to work"" and walks away.

So now I'm concerned. I ask Pam if we can talk privately and ask her if she had a problem with me having the day off. She says that yes, she'd been wanting to talk to me, that when I take the day off ""suddenly"", it sets everyone back. I explain that it wasn't sudden, I asked beforehand AND after checking with an employee, they were fine. Plus she said they would manage. 

Pam says I shouldn't have asked Ann first to take the day off because if Ann said I could then Pam wouldn't be able to say I couldn't. Also when I informed Pam, I should've offered to work from home. I just ended the conversation amicably because I had no idea how to respond.

I've never fallen back and when I can't finish my tasks at work, I always make sure it's done at home. I adapted quickly and am doing the same tasks as any mid level employee though I'm the only intern there. I've made errors though, nothing fatal, but still mistakes that prevent me from being considered optimal. I thought I was still okay but her attitude has made me doubt myself.

Now, I dislike Pam. She jibes about my age, how thin I am and it's all genetics (nope, it's calorie counting), my clothes, etc. She makes comments about my work instead of talking it out. But while I've tried to be objective it's just my side at the end of the day. I'm only including this because her issue with me may be personal or vice versa.

In 3 weeks time I am going to a convention where my favourite YouTuber and their wife will be attending. I have loved this YouTuber for 7 years, have watched all the content and podcasts numerous times everyday. Literally, their videos are on all the time, as background noise while I work, or in my headphones to help me sleep.

Im so excited at the chance to finally meet them, and had the idea a few days ago to ask for a small doodle rather than an autograph, so I can have it tattooed. I'm already heavily tattooed, and had planned a piece relating to this YouTuber for a while, but thought I couldn't miss the opportunity to get something from them as it would mean 10x more.

My problem is, the Youtubers wife whom I also adore to bits, is an illustrator. They produce amazing art and I would love something from them too, but I don't want to appear like I am trying to get free artwork and offend them. Even if they weren't an artist, I would still have 100% asked for a doodle all the same, I just don't want to come across a bit of a dick. 

I would of course disclose that I plan to get it tattooed when asking, in case they weren't happy with that.

So  AITA for asking for this instead?

c3og9y	2019-06-22 11:07:08	Goingtothefuture1	AITA for abandoning my family following my father's death to join the military?	"FYI, English isn't my first language, and I'm not from the US.

Two months ago, my father passed away in an industrial accident (he was a factory worker). My mother, sister, and I managed to survive for a while on some charity money given by our extended family, but that money is running out. We have virtually no savings, and my father was the sole source of income. I'm 18, and my mom arranged with my dad's boss at the factory to give me a job. I put off accepting or rejecting it because I was waiting for the results from the Army.

A few months ago, I tried out for the Army officer cadets. Every year, the army cadet program (where they train new recruits into officers) had open tryouts for people 17-20. They show up to the nearest army base and are out through a rigorous testing process that includes physical testing, an IQ test, and an interview. The latter part is almost purely luck- the interviewer could ask anything, and based on their personality, they could hate or love your answers. If you're accepted, you get trained and then are an officer in the Army. I decided to try out. I have no strong feelings towards the army, but my reasoning was this: I have ambitions of getting out of poverty and becoming rich. However, to do so, you need either money, an education, or both. Even before my dad died, my family didn't have much money, not even enough to send me to college for an education. So the army's my only option: it's highly respected, and after 4 years I can get out. Former army officers have high rates of matriculation at top schools,and there's a education pension for former officers. That sounds like an overall win-win to me. So I tried out.

I decided that if I got accepted, I'd accept the cadetship. But if I didn't get in, I'd take the job. Just two days ago, I received mail that I had been accepted as a cadet. My mom urged me not to accept, because if I didn't work, the family supposedly would have no money. She asked me to just work for a year and then try out again. But I don't want to do this, because of these reasons:

- There's no guarantee I'll be accepted if I try out again. As I mentioned, the interview is pure luck. And in factories, accidents are common. So what if I get injured and can't pass the physical?

- I'm not the only person in the house capable of doing work. My mom's 39, hardly elderly, and perfectly healthy. My sister is 20 and not in school anymore. And there are work opportunities for them- not great ones, but there are opportunities

- Nobody just spends a year as a factory worker and leaves: that's exactly what happened to my dad. He just wanted to work there for a few years until he saved enough to go to college. But he met my mom, got married, and here we are.

So I decided to take the cadetship offer. Ever since then, my mom has been giving me the silent treatment. Am I TA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3oegu	2019-06-22 11:00:52	danislee	WIBTA if I tell a coworker he’s being “too nice” and that I need space?	"My coworker is a gay white man, Toby. (For reference I’m a woman of color.) When we met I thought he was nice. We had common interests we became friends. We laughed, hung out, hugged etc.

***EDIT: I mention his sexuality because I don’t want anyone to think he’s interested in me or that he might be doing this because he has a warped method of getting attention from someone he likes. There have been unwelcome hugs and I do think he needs to respect boundaries, but I don’t want anyone to misinterpret things because he’s a man. I’m not bringing it up to shame him. Or make a blanket statement about gay men. 

We were interested in different promotions. Toby was supportive.

In an effort to prove his leadership skills and bc we were friends he began to speak over me during meetings and presentations with clients. He frequently undercut me to pull focus. Once he felt the need to stand beside me “because people will listen better if there’s a white man up here.”

I spoke to a manager about the pulling focus/speaking over not the WM comment because I thought I was being too sensitive. The manager was supportive and spoke to Toby about his behavior.

Toby came to my cubicle and told me I hurt his promo chances and that I should have spoken to him directly rather than involve mgmt.

My behavior toward him cooled. (No hugging, no platonic “love yous/hey bff” no hanging out outside work except in group settings, no texting unless asked a direct unavoidable question.)

Meanwhile, he didn’t get his promotion and began to discourage me from the one I wanted because “he would probably get it.” I applied anyway. (Other people in my department thought I’d be a great fit, including supervisors.)

My boss returned from his honeymoon and let me know he wasn’t looking for candidates due to lack of need. I wasn’t bothered. You can’t have what isn’t available.

Why the change? Toby requested lateral training, was approved, and filled the vacancy. I was disappointed and hurt.

I stopped any unnecessary communication with him. I spoke to him only in a professional context. I didn’t respond to his texts/FB/IG/Twitter messages. I did my best to avoid him when not required to be in the same room.

He realized I was hurt, but is unaware I know he requested the training. He told me the reason he got it was “they needed to fill it fast and you would need more training then me.”

For a month he respected the change in our relationship. But lately he’s been going back to the “I love you,” and expecting reciprocation. Or making it seem like we’re close by bringing up conversations we had months ago in front of people. (“My Name & I both love X and talk about Y all the time!”) He also name drops my husband. (My husband isn’t famous, he’s just busy, so most coworkers haven’t met him. But Toby has.) He has also started praising me in front of people. (New hires, supervisor, mgmt.)

I don’t like his new comfort level but maybe I am too sensitive.  Writing it all out it seems like being upset someone is too friendly or too nice...

c3oec3	2019-06-22 11:00:27	Throwaway17561756	AITA for not wanting my nephew to wear a flower girl dress to my wedding?	"My 6 year old nephew is adamant that he wants to wear a flower girl dress and be a flower girl for my wedding, which is happening today in about 11 hours. He also has shoulder length hair which he’s planning on wearing flowers in. 

He’s being raised my my younger sister, who is a single mom. She came out as a lesbian about 4 years ago and I feel like she is overly encouraging about a lot of the clothes he wears and activities he does. He regularly wears rainbow tights, sparkly shoes, and a two piece bathing suit when he goes swimming. He also wants to be a make up artist when he grows up. 

I’ve never once said anything negative about what he wears or doesn’t wear, but I asked her to dress him and my other nephew (my other sister’s son) in similar outfits (dress pants and dress shirt/tie) for their special ring bearer roles (which they asked for). My sister lost her shit and was extremely upset that I would ask him to wear something he’s so uncomfortable in. My fiancé wants to empower him and she bought a flower girl dress for him to wear. 

AITA here? I understand what he likes to wear/not wear, but he’s 6 and we’re paying a lot of money for this wedding. If I was going somewhere fancy when I was younger, I wouldn’t get to choose what I was wearing. I realize it’s 2019 and I don’t know if my thought process is just archaic or if I’m really just being an asshole, but I feel like it’s my special day as well and I’m not asking for too much.

Edit: I used agenda incorrectly and changed the sentence. I’m not trying to troll or bait anyone.

Edit 2: although the wedding is today, the attire was decided a couple of months ago. Nothing is going to change and he will be wearing a dress for the wedding, I just wanted to see what people thought."	Asshole	0	0

c3o9zv	2019-06-22 10:44:30	intervee_throwaway	AITA for cutting job interviews short	"I've been interviewing candidates for various jobs in my small business. I had 60-70 candidates over 10 years. I have good staff retention and generally believe people working for me are happy. 

I've had three complaint that the interview process was not fair. The third complaint was a few weeks ago, but unlike in the past, this was also by the recruiter (who never placed someone with me).  

So I'd like to see if I'm the asshole in this situation or not. 

My usual approach is this: 

**Interview process**

After a screener interview, candidates are given a typical problem (1 page document) and are asked to pick a subproblem to spend a few (3 suggested) hours on to present how they would approach it. This is then presented in an interview. I schedule this for 1.5 - 2 hours maximum.

The first half is led by me, a brief introduction to the company, followed by a presentation of the solution to the task and presentation with time for any questions. Another staff member is present and may ask questions.

The second half is led by an external HR consultant and focuses on a psychological assessment if the candidate can handle stress. I pay for the HR consultant. This does not come cheap.

**Rating**

I have a clear rating process that essentially tells us if we think N% of typical candidates are better or worse. The HR person usually either signs off or recommends against a candidate based on their evaluation. 

**The complaint**

In the case of the most recent complaint we thought the person had absolutely no chance to get the job and our joint (and independent assessment) was that he was rating poorer than 5% of the candidates we'd usually see. I was tempted to cut the interview short but stuck to my 45 minutes. When I spoke to the HR person she reminded me straight away that we would have other stuff to discuss. 

I made a white lie to the candidate telling her that my HR person was running late and that if we proceed she'd be interviewed separately, politely sent her off. I notified her the same day that unfortunately we had decided not to proceed, which made her complain about the process. 

So did I act like an asshole?"	Asshole	0	0
c3o9yn	2019-06-22 10:44:24	economicalchestnut	WIBTA if I don't return my previous employer's keys from over a year ago?	"I quit my last job over a year ago.

It was an amicable departure and not particularly interesting.  On my last day, I returned everything: the laptop, phone, charger, keys, etc, and HR/supervisor signed a form to say I had done so.

&#x200B;

Fast forward one year, I realize I still had the keys to the other office.

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole if I held onto the keys until they ask for it back?

&#x200B;

I work on the other side of town now, so I would basically have to take a day off to hand them back.  I also work 7am-7pm, i.e. outside of trading hours, so I can't get to a post office.

&#x200B;

edit:

Another  reason why I don't simply mail them back is that my previous employer  is very lax (which explains why they haven't asked for the keys back).   The receptionist who handles all the mail is really old and forgetful.   She struggles to remember my name and I've worked there for years.

I'd rather keep the keys and hand them back in in person if I'm ever in the area."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3o7be	2019-06-22 10:34:44		AITA for letting my friends over for a video project	"During the recent spring semester of college, I had a video project due with a small span of 1 1/2 weeks. Had to be 10 to 15mins of talking and we needed everyone to speak in our video. Everyone had pretty busy schedules, we needed to film 80% of the project one day to have some cushion days for editing. To get a good grade we wanted to include our with a green screen and lights with props etc. Our group was thinking doing it inside our school library but the school wouldn’t allow us having all the props and lights inside. 

Me and my S/O have a small apartment not too far away from the college and I told her me and my friends were going to the apartment to finish up the green screen portions of our video project. It worked for everyone in the group since my apartment is in the middle of everyone else’s houses. She wasn’t home and I told her it would take at max around 3 hours. My S/O tells me no because she doesn’t feel comfortable having people in our apartment. I reassured her that we would only stay in our living room to film and the house will be clean when she comes back from work. She still said no. 

I told my friends we had to finish the video and told them to come over. We finished it and the apartment was spotless....no mess, I swear no one couldn’t tell if anyone was over. I tell my wife when she comes home from work that my friends (that she personally knows and has been to their houses) came over, and she yells at me. She begins to cry and shout, saying that it doesn’t matter what she does, I will get to do whatever I want.

c3o65q	2019-06-22 10:30:40		AITA for kinda liking my friends ex?	"Ok so that title seems real bad and I honestly don’t know if the context will help but anyways so here it goes

So recently one of my friends (who we’ll allocate EBF, for ex boyfriend) got dumped by his now ex girlfriend, EGF. The thing is, I’m friends with both of them, but it’s fair to say that I’ve always been better friends with EGF (there’s about 7 people in our friend group including them). When her relationship with EBF was rocky she came to my best friend and I for advice. To put it shortly, EBF was extraordinarily clingy, jealous, controlling, completely dependant on EGF, hypocritical, manipulative, and all-round not a great person to be in a relationship with. So inevitably, with the whole group backing him (except EGF obviously), she ended things. 

Now of course we were there to comfort both of them post breakup, but because I’m closer friends with EGF I stuck around with her more often to make sure she was alright. We’ve been hanging out a lot more, talking a lot more, etc, things that EBF wouldn’t have allowed if they were still together because *how dare she be friends with someone of the opposite gender.*

Now the thing is, things have been low key flirty lately. Nothing obvious from either end but we’re in a lot of the same classes and have a lot of the same interests. And honestly I’m really not sure about how I feel about the whole situation because again, she *is* my friends ex. If that weren’t so I’d go for it, but the way things are I don’t think I could. On one hand, I think EGF is kinda done with having her actions controlled by EBF, but on the other I’m still his friend and I know he wouldn’t like it.

Back when I was too young to understand, my grandmother manipulated my younger sister and I with gifts and treats and promises, doing her best to make us favor her over our actual parents, for some time she did well, though by the time I was twelve(I am Twenty now) I was seeing how she messed with my sister and I. She was crying constantly about lies, very obvious ones at that, telling us not to tell our mother, lying about divorcing our grandfather. She did this for years, eventually I stop going to her house, after getting my sister to agree, she called daily and cried on the phone about how she missed us and was having a really hard time around the house(She didn't even cook, She made my grandfather clean, cook, work,mow the lawn, drive, etc.) 
   My grandfather, who was an absolute badass, had two knees replaced, a kidney transplant, a metal heart valve, and skin cancer, yet he didn't care about the pain, he only cared about making his wife and family happy. But back in track, I can't really do it justice with how she made me feel, I tried to take the brunt of it when I started noticing the emotional manipulation, but it eventually messed up my head. She even managed to turn my three uncle's against my family for no reason. It's made certain emotional things hard to even feel, like when my family finally moved across the country, I couldn't even cry for The lost friends or family, and eventually when my grandfather passed away, I couldn't cry even when he was like a second father to my already amazing dad. 
    So now my mother gives me grief about refusing to speak with said grandmother, she says I need to ""Get over it, it's probably just mental illness"" But I don't want that toxicity in my life, I've finally started getting my head together, I don't want that manipulation clawing at me again, so, am I the asshole for refusing to speak with my grandmother?

"So in my country, we have a system of apprenticeship alongside university- basically, a portion of your time is spent shadowing and learning from a person within the career. For reference, I'm on the tech/business track and shadowing a startup founder. There's another kid at our University, let's call him William. He's on the politics track and shadowing a politician of some sort. 

William and I both dislike each other a lot. He leans very socialist when it comes to most issues. I on the other hand am basically our university's most prominent business student (not trying to brag): I run the University's business/finance newsletter, am President of the Investment Club, founded the entrepreneurship club, and run a shoe reselling business on the side. At first, I only knew him because he was dating one of my friends, Chris, (strange, because Chris is also a business student), and didn't think much of him either way. However, he- through Chris- always hangs out with my friend group and makes snide comments about me. This quickly got on my nerves.

c3nz0n	2019-06-22 10:05:16		AITA for asking back the item i gave to an ex-friend	"I had a huge arguement with my female friend,lets call her elin, who accused me of being a liar and manipulating her other friend to not befriend with her as well. I did my best trying to explain and defended what she accused me off and yeah we had a fight through whatsapp and I did blow off a steam. So far, it's been 3 weeks since we last spoke face to face, she blocked me from every social media, I couldn't contact her, I was planning to ask my friend to arrange a meetup with her to settle things as mature adults but most of my friend said i shouldn't do it because elin had obviously show no interest to fix this broken friendship and try to forgive me formally. Elin did said that I'm not suited to be her ""friend"" anymore, although she did apologize and forgive me through whatsapp.

It occured to me yesterday when I saw her in class that she no longer wears the watch in witch i gave it to her, but I did mention to her before giving it that the watch is a symbol of our friendship and only a friend gets to use and wear it. I didn't want to take it negatively that she doesn't want to be friend with me anymore but I heard from a friend that she's also been badmouthing me to other girls and guys. So I felt this has been taken too far and I decided it's time to end it. I planned to ask her back every stuff i gave to her in which i stated earlier every gift is for friends only and it seems she's the one who refuse to try and fix this situation and to pay up the debt that she delibaretely didn't pay even though she was informed beforehand by me.

So am i the asshole for asking back the stuff and ending this friendship?"		1	0

My sister is engaged. We planned a ladies hiking trip for this summer. I live 14 hours from my sister. My boyfriend and I have a new dog, and my sister encouraged me to bring the dog on the trip. It’s a dog-friendly backpacking loop and is the perfect opportunity to get him in shape for summer. 

So, I drove down to my sisters’ to get situated before heading out on the hike tomorrow. I got in at 8 pm, we’re leaving at 8 am. (Giving me 12 hours at she and her fiancée place with the dog)

During this time, her fiancé has made it very clear he is annoyed with the dogs presence. He pooped in their yard, I picked it up quickly, he asked numerous times if I’d picked it up.He whispered about how my dogs nails were scratching the hard wood to my sister (they weren’t, I got nervous and checked this after). I asked her if they actually had, and if so, I would repair it. She said they hadn’t. They have a cat I’ve kept the dog away from, or tried to gently introduce, and he was panicked the entire time. He was upset about the dog sloshing some water and said that the wood would raise, though I wiped it up. 

Needless to say, I know that he hates the dog being here. I do feel badly about it. But, I am confused because my sister encouraged me to bring the dog? He is young, but not naughty. I also know that not everyone likes dogs, and it is his home. However, I had no idea that he would hate the dog being here... I will never bring him back, but AITA here? 

Also, my sister wants me to stay for the weekend after our trip. We will be done Friday, she wants me to head home Monday. I want to spend time with her, but feel that her fiancé would NOT like this. I feel torn,should I just say that I don’t want to overstay our welcome next weekend, and leave after the hiking trip?

c3ntlx	2019-06-22 09:45:51	annoyed_dadtobe	AITA for telling our friends/family to back off with their concerns about my wife's pregnancy?	"I have been with my wife Maria for five years. There is a big age gap between us. I am 31 and she is 48. She is very beautiful but has never been married or had children before me, since she never found anyone who she really felt a connection with. 

Due to her age we knew that the chances of children were slim, which is why we haven't bothered with birth control. Imagine our shock when we found out that Maria was pregnant at her age. 

We announced it to everyone, and while all our family and friends were happy for us, lots of them began pointing out the many risks involved with being pregnant in your late forties. We are of course aware of these risks and are taking every possible precaution.

Whenever I speak to someone over the phone they will mention ask if we are staying safe or whatever and will never fail to remind us that pregnancy is dangerous at 48. 

Yesterday evening I had a go at everyone at my sister's garden party, and told them that while we appreciated their concern, we are well aware of the risks involved and don't need to be continually reminded. 

The reason I'm posting this is that some of their concerns may not be age related, and may have been the same if Maria was a younger woman. I feel like if that were the case, then I've now made them feel guilty unnecessarily."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3nszx	2019-06-22 09:43:37	Iwouldrathernotgo23	WIBTA if I didn't attend my boyfriends cousins wedding.	"I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years now so you could say it's pretty serious. I was under the impression for months that I wad invited to his cousins wedding, but recently I found out that Im only invitrd to the after party. This isn't a grand party or anything, it's drinks and pizzas.

So I didn't want to go. I felt it was disrespectful not to invite me, but at the end of the day the bride can invite whoever she wants that's none of my business. BUT I'm essentially being forced into going. When I said I didn't want to go my boyfriend broke down and said he really wanted me there and that his family would 'talk' if I didn't attend the after party. See, he's British and I won't give away where I'm from but in my culture, not inviting families significant others is kind of like telling them to go fuck myself. I felt insulted, especially when the reasoning is that it would cost an extra £70 to seat me when I'd be paying more than that just to get a train ticket out to where the wedding is taking place.

I felt it was really unfair that he held the fact that his family would hate me over my head. If they wanted me there maybe they should have invited me to the actual wedding? I've attended just wedding parties before Lebanese weddings, Nigerian, Greek etc and they were amazing. However, at risk of looking like a snobby bitch, this is just a pizza party. So why on earth should I spend £80 just for that? My boyfriend has offered to pay but I don't like him paying for things, especially for an event I don't even want to go to

After he cried and told me his family would hate me I agreed to go but I really want to back out because I feel like I never had a choice to say no in the first place."	Asshole	0	0
c3nsja	2019-06-22 09:41:50		AITA for being mad at my boyfriend for sleeping all day and for making me miss going to the beach?	"So, my boyfriend lives about 40 minutes - 1h30 minutes away (depending on mode of transportation) in Seoul.  


This week, it was his week to come and visit, so when we were talking about what to do, I told him that I wanted to go to the beach an hour away. He said that he didn't want to do that, because he wanted to sleep in (the direct trains leaving from Seoul to where I live are either from 6 AM or 3 PM). He's the type of person who gets up at like 12 PM, which is fine, so yeah, that didn't happen. He was going to come to my city via the 3 PM train, so he'd get here at around 4 PM, and we'd just hang out together all day.  


Today, Saturday, in the midst of my morning meditation, I hear him entering my apartment. Apparently he decided to go out partying all night, didn't sleep, and took the first train to my city. I was kind of annoyed, because I planned on having a loooong, slow morning and seeing him at 3 - 4 PM. I didn't like that he just changed his mind without telling me last minute. I don't care what time he shows up, but I was scared during my meditation because I heard someone entering my apartment. I acted mad at him, because I just couldn't believe that he showed up at my house at 9 AM that drunk still and the whole reason I couldn't go to the beach was because he was coming here at 3 PM. He got mad at me for being mad at him... I mean, I was up and ready to start my day and he was about to get his full sleep cycle. He stormed out of my apartment to go back to Seoul, but came back 30 minutes later because all of the tickets were sold out.  


Anyways, he then proceeds to sleep from 9 AM to 6 PM. I tried to gently wake him up every hour or so to do something, but when he's sleeping, he's sleeping. He just woke up now, and I tried to tell him that I was low key annoyed because I spent my day watching him sleep when I could've done something, but he doesn't think it's that bad because he was supposed to show up at 3 PM anyways, so it was only 3 hours lost.  


I'm a bit annoyed too because now I want to eat dinner and start winding down (I go to bed early), and he's going to be fully awake the whole night. Also, he's 24 years old, I was a huge fucking partier in college (and still am from time to time), but get your life together bro. Sleeping in until 6 PM is a bit excessive.

c3nreg	2019-06-22 09:37:44	Iamsunce	AITA for not speaking to sister after her reaction to birthday gift from parents and me?	"Bg info:
Me and sister both live with parents. My dad is retired but has his own little side job. Mom had cancer last year and just now started working. I'm 25, finishing medical school. Sister is 21, first year in the same medical school. My parents pay for our college, and we are only asked to be successful and finish in time. My family is doing okay, we are not rich by any means, but live very comfortably.


One thing my parents absolutely hate investing is technology. Their stance is, phones die within 3 years so what's the point of buying very expensive ones. They are a bit difficult. This year, my old phone from 2015 died and they were forced to buy me a new one, as an early birthday gift. I was given a budget to buy a phone for max 150 euros. I picked one and I'm super happy with it. 


At the same time, my sister's phone from 2016 was starting to act weird. The buttons don't really work, it glitches and freezes a lot. So I figured I'd help mom and dad pick a new one. That was a struggle, I fought with them for weeks, explaining why she needed it, helping them find one she would love. I knew she wanted a phone with a good camera, preferably a Samsung. When I asked if she'd want Huawei, she said the camera on Samsung was better, and to quote ""the color black looks better in Samsung pictures"". I don't know tbh. 


Samsung is much more expensive than Huawei, and I tried my best to find one she'd like. I tried to up the budget, but mom and dad were set on a certain price point (which was higher than mine, just saying) and I understand that. I personally picked the best phone I could with the money we had, and made sure it had what she needs.


So. I gave her my gifts (perfume and Harry Potter map from London) and then the phone. She seemed to like my presents, but the moment she opened the phone she seemed to go sour. She immediately compared her old phone screen size to the new one. Said it looked a bit small. Turned on the new phone but didn't even want to set it up. She said she didn't want to sound ungrateful but she was very particular about phones. Said she didn't want us to buy her a new phone. I was honestly so hurt I didn't know what to say? She even asked if I picked it myself and I was just silent because it was awkward. I spent so much time arguing with mom and dad about it, looking up different types, comparing, wanting to surprise her. I know we don't have a lot of money on luxuries such as brand new phones, and it was so difficult to even persuade them to buy it for her bc She's been doing really bad in college, and my parents said she didn't deserve it. And she ended up hating it 


I know I sound dramatic but I haven't spoken to her since. She left the house to wait till midnight for her birthday with her best friend. I didn't hear her come home. I don't want to even look at her, I'm disappointed and hurt. Am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3npoj	2019-06-22 09:31:21	Finishfound8	AITA for referring to a girl as 'the one with big boobs' because I don't remember anything else about her?	"The people involved in this situation which happened a few days ago: me [15F], Ryan [15M], Will [16M], Sara [16F], and Lydia [either 15 or 16f, idk] (not directly involved in the situation but is the girl that's being discussed).

So, the four of us are friends. We got together to hang out and plan a party at Ryan's house that was going to happen later during summer break. We were discussing who to invite. We were basically throwing out names and discussing whether they should be invited or not. Ryan suggested we invite this girl named Lydia. The name didn't ring any bells, so I asked Ryan to clarify who he was talking about. He and I were in the same AP Stats class freshman year, and he told me that Lydia was in that class with us. I thought about it a moment, and sort of hazily remembered someone. I wasn't sure if I was thinking of the right person. There were only two things I could remember about her, since she obviously didn't make much of an impression: red hair and big boobs. So I started out by asking Ryan if she was the one with red hair. Ryan said maybe, there were two girls in that class with red hair, so you might be thinking of the other one. I then asked if she was the one with big boobs, and he replied in the affirmative.

Bringing up boobs pissed off Sara, for whatever reason. She made a snide comment about how I as a girl should 'know better'. I don't see anything that was wrong with what I said. It's a bit awkward to talk about boobs with guys, sure- which is why I brought up hair color first- but all I was trying to do was confirm if she was who I was thinking she was. I barely remember a girl named Lydia, and the only thing that came to mind with the name was red hair and big boobs, so I was describing that to confirm if the person I was thinking of was Lydia.

He’s a great dog and can be friendly, but anything he even slightly determines to be a threat towards her and he becomes very aggressive. Even when we have a light argument he will perceive me as a threat and bark and growl at me aggressively. Not even yelling loudly but just having raised voices.  I feel ganged up on and feel like I can’t ever have a disagreement for fear of her dog retaliating. It’s like he can sense even slightly tense body language and immediately tries to neutralize the threat. 

Sometimes when I try to walk towards her or near her(for any reason) he gets in my way and blocks my path. If he’s lying on the couch and she walks away into the room, and I go into the room after her he’ll immediately jump off the couch and bolt in front of me and get to her first. I assume this is because he doesn’t trust me.

At first it was amusing but now it’s annoying and downright threatening at times. I finally decided to call her out on it when we we went out and she got very defensive. Claims that I’m just jealous that her dog loves her and that if I would stop “being an asshole” then he wouldn’t act that way towards me."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c3ngoi	2019-06-22 08:58:17	LaineVu	WIBTA if I cut my daughter off our insurance?	"Note: We're Punjabi and live in California. My kids were born & raised in the SF Bay Area.

My daughter is 21 and despite growing up fairly privileged, having all the resources in the world, great grades, good major, etc. has decided to marry a loser.

She introduced him to us a few months in, and my husband & I expressed our disapproval but didn't worry because we figured it would end soon enough. My other daughter and nieces all went through a similar phase and ended up settling with educated young men with good futures. No cause for concern.

This boy is not educated, does not have family values, always partying, gets blackout drunk with his buddies, zero ambition. I have friends who know his parents and have heard negative things about his family as well.

My daughter went to India last month and married him. They are not legally wed in the US, but in our community it's only the religious ceremony that matters so they're considered husband & wife in our social circle.

She's 21 and has 3 more years left of school. She's moved out to her in-laws (it's customary in Punjabi culture for the girl to live with her husband's family). She says she's going to wait 3-4 years before having a big wedding party in America and signing an official marriage certificate for two reasons: (1) to finish school & save up money (2) so she can stay on our medical insurance while she's in school

She said she can pay for her phone, car note, everyday expenses, etc. with her husband's pay while she finishes up school. The only thing she asked if we can keep her name on our insurance policy.

My husband & I are conflicted. On one hand, no money is taken out of my husband's paycheck (he's a physician) for our insurance and it's really top of the line insurance, great coverage.

On the other hand, we are heartbroken at what our daughter has done. We broke our backs to give our kids everything we could. All we asked was for basic respect and that's not what we got. What is the rush to get married at 21? We're not so backwards that we expect our daughter to sit at home 24/7. It's fine to have fun with friends, take trips (we've financed several trips to Mexico/Europe for our kids), party, have boyfriends, etc. it's all fine so long as the kids behave nicely and keep their grades up. We're more lenient than 90% of Punjabi parents. But she's embarrassed us so badly in the community, I've had so many people come up to me and say rude things. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I can't help it. It's so deeply ingrained in our culture and I've rejected 90% of this backwards mentality, but some of it sticks and it hurts.

TL;DR: Daughter married someone we very much don't approve of. She wants to stay on our insurance policy until she's done with school. It won't cost us much money but we're heartbroken at what she's done and feel it's unfair for her to not consider our feelings but ask for our money/resources. WIBTA if we cut her off?"	Asshole	0	0

c3nfzt	2019-06-22 08:55:51		AITA for not wanting to pay rent at my boyfriend's condo?	"Throwaway just in case.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend (34M) and I (23F) have been together for a little over a year now. When we first got together, things moved quickly and within a couple months, I was spending almost every night at his place and still do. After a while, his roommates, a married couple, asked for me to start paying rent since I basically lived there. I don't make much money (they all make 3-5x my income). To keep the peace, my BF started covering my share of the rent and has done so for the past 6 months without asking me to come up with the extra $500/month. He was already paying a larger share because he is in the master bedroom, but now he pays about 60% of the entire rent while the couple split the last 40% between them. They used to have a 4th roommate who moved out, but instead of letting my BF find someone to replace him, the couple said they wanted to use his old room for ""storage"" even though most of the condo is already filled with their belongings. Then they asked for me to pay rent instead. 

&#x200B;

At the moment, I already do chores around the condo (cleaning, laundry, dishes, etc) and pay about $500/month for our groceries. I think my contribution is proportional to my income, but my BF has insinuated that he wishes I'd pay for my part of the rent, too. He has never officially asked me to move in with him.  We have had discussions on the subject and so far, I have not offered to pay. 

&#x200B;

The reason is that I have a whole other house to myself where I don't have to pay rent at present. (Mom bought it but lives elsewhere with stepdad). Knowing that I can't really afford to pay my mom rent right now, I intend to assume the mortgage payments from her once I have finished my Master's and start my better-paying ""grown up"" job. My boyfriend & I do plan on getting married and possibly even living in that house in the future.

&#x200B;

Because of that, paying rent at his condo doesn't seem wise to me; it seems like it's throwing money away. I'd rather pay toward something I'm going to own one day versus a rented place where I can't build equity.

&#x200B;

To add another layer to the whole thing, I recently received news that I will be coming into a bit of money. So at this point, I'm thinking maybe I should just pay my share of the condo rent so there is less friction in our relationship. I love my boyfriend very much and I think it might make him happier. But I don't really want to do it, for the aforementioned reasons.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I am de facto living at my BF's condo even though he never officially asked me to move in. His two other roommates are a married couple that won't allow him to find a 4th roommate for an empty room because they want to use it for storage, and want to charge me rent instead. BF covers my share but is clearly not happy now he's paying 60% of the rent. I don't want to pay rent because I already have a house where I would rather pay the mortgage in the future.

"My wife has been playing a lot of ""women empowerment"" songs for our daughter going into middle school, and most of them I have no problem with even though I do think Meghan Trainor *All About That Bass* is a little sexualized for a young girl. But this new one I just really don't want her exposed to. It's *Try* by Colbie Caillat. I get the song has this message about loving yourself rather than changing yourself, but the chorus is literally ""you don't have to try"". I don't want my kid listening to that and believing it. I want to raise a kid that knows, whatever else, she has to try-even if she fails. This empowerment song is not swinging for me and I banned it from the house.

My wife says I'm being an asshole, purposely missing the point of the song, and she doesn't have to listen to me. I know the point of the song, I don't want my daughter to hear ""you don't have to try"" and just apply it to everything. And I should get a fucking say in what my daughter hears.

And I don't like telling people their religion is 'false'. I'm a pretty silent and reserved family member too.

Anyways, here's what happened. I got a bunch of chain mail from family talking about how the world is ending because there's no prayer in public schools, same sex marriage (oh btw,  I'm a woman in a relationship with a woman) and abortion rights etc.. 
I didnt respond because it was like 6 different family members. 

So I went on a rant in a post instead. I was pretty fed up and pissed off because I get sent shit like that everyday, even though they know where I stand as far as beliefs and morals go. I went off, explaining that if there is gonna be an end to the world it will be from religion its self and not atheism.

I think this was more of a way to freak them out, and piss them off so they leave me alone on social media and in general when I see the, when it comes to these topics. They love to constantly tell me I'm sick and need jesus, and tell me they're always praying for me.

So anyways, now my dad is pissed at me because I hurt my aunts feelings. See, my intention wasn't to hurt feelings. That makes me feel like shit and now I feel like an asshole. It makes me feel even more like an ass because shes sick and probably wont be around much longer. And the more I think about it, the more shitty I feel because my dad's side of the family's entire identity is their religion. 

But on the same token, my feelings are hurt for essentially saying my existence is the end of the world and I am 'sick'. 

Am I the asshole? 

TL;DR 
My religious family keeps sending me chain mail telling me gays and athiests (I am both) will be the end of the world. I went off in a post about christianity and hurt my aunts feelings."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3ndi3	2019-06-22 08:46:12	swimmingburb	AITA for asking my girlfriend to leave a concert early?	"My Background : I am a police officer and used to work in a very active jail dealing with junkies. I am also very much in love with my girlfriend and have talked about marriage. 

Background of the issue : My girlfriend and her friend (two females) went to a concert which I have no issue with. I work crazy hours and don’t get to spend as much time with my friends/family,  so I’m perfectly ok with her hanging out with her friends. 


The problem: A few days before the concert she told me that her friend would be the designated driver. One of the first post to her Snapchat was them both with large mixed drinks. This is where I start worrying, my girlfriend says that there is hardly an alcohol in the drinks, that they are over priced, and that her and her friend would be leaving soon. This was around 7pm. Around 8:30-9:00pm she is still posting snapchats about the concert so I ask about it and she says that another performance came on. Then she tells me there is cocaine at the concert. Now I’m maximum worry, as the experience from the job tells me where this cocaine there normally follows other drugs. Not to mention having fought with junkies, I know I personally would not like to be in a situation where people are snorting coke around me as it can be very dangerous. I am also aware that there is only two of them and worried as my girlfriend told me she had been roofied a few years ago. I ask her to leave the concert for her safety. She then tells me if I want to her hide in the bathroom so she can miss the show, I tell her that I don’t want her to separate from her friend and that I’m very much worried for both of them.  She then calls me and says that I need to chill out, and I’m over reacting. At this point she had been rude with me and I told she was being disrespectful.  I never called her any names and was trying to tell that I trusted her, but it was the other people using drugs/selling drugs that I was worried about. She ended up staying the full time, then called me. She called me a dick for asking her to leave and ruining her night. I explained to her that I was on duty and need to focus and would like to talk to her about the issue at a better time but she kept trying to push the issue. I just asked her to let me know when she got home safely and has now ignored me. The time is now 3:30am where I am and I have not heard from her since she left.  I am still extremely worried about her as I have no idea she made it home.  She also stated to that she wouldn’t tell me about it next time and that had she not told me about the drugs she would have a great night. I am not sure if her silence is her being vindictive... 


TLDR: girlfriend went to concert, said she would leave at 7, stayed till 9ish, said there was cocaine, I asked to her leave because of the danger, she stayed till the end, then tried to start an argument while I was at work, I asked to table it till a better time, she didn’t want to, I asked to let me know when she got home,  no reply back.

c3nc2b	2019-06-22 08:40:44	FallingDiphthongs	AITA for being pushy about a trip to visit my long distance boyfriend?	"A friend suggested that I post in here to get a broader perspective.

Background info: I'm in a poly relationship (3 years with live-in partner named T, 6 months with long distance partner named C). Please do not comment on the poly aspect as it's not the focus of this post.

C suggested that I visit him again in July (my last visit was in April) and I brought it up with T. After some conflict, we agreed on terms and I booked the flights and accommodation (which ended up being way more tedious than I expected, thanks to Airbnb). We were going to stay at an Airbnb at a resort town a few hours away from C. 

However, a couple nights ago, C asked me if the reservations could be cancelled (they couldn't), and revealed to me that he had lost his job. I asked him if there was any way to make the trip work, and he said he didn't think so.

I tried coming up with some suggestions, but he shut down each one and said they wouldn't work, but he didn't come up with any alternatives.

I got upset, and I admit that I yelled, and he said I wasn't being sympathetic about his situation. I said that he wasn't being sympathetic about mine either, and that he wasn't even trying to make this trip work despite saying how much he had wanted it to happen.

This is getting long so let me just add a few points:

* Because of school and work, if this trip doesn't work out, we won't be able to see each other until next year
* He is worried that he will start a new job that won't allow him to take two weeks' vacation
* I suggested that he does some temporary work before the trip, go on the trip, and then search for a better permanent job when he gets back, but he said no (he has a possible job lined up for next week)
* I also suggested that I just stay at his house instead of us going to the resort town, but he said no (complicated mental health reason)
* Since there are no refunds for the flights or accommodations, I'll be losing out $2000 if the trip doesn't happen
* The proposed trip was to happen in two weeks - so I feel like it's a time sensitive thing to solve

I have been alternating being heartbroken and being angry. I understand that he's worried about his job, but I also just want to see him.

But am I being an asshole by continuously talking about the trip, suggesting options, and asking him to figure it out with me?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c3nb26	2019-06-22 08:37:04		WIBTA if I cut off my daughter from our insurance plan?	"Note: We're ethnically Punjabi and live in California. My kids were born & raised in California.

My daughter is 21 and despite growing up fairly privileged, having all the resources in the world, great grades, good major, etc. has decided to marry a loser. I HATE to disparage someone on their job, so I won't mention his job by title but it's a very typical job for young Punjabi men who spend high school/college years partying and then realize they have no good career prospects. He makes about $45K/year with zero chance to go significantly above that. We live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so that's barely above poverty wages. 

My daughter introduced him to us a few months into the relationship, when we met the boy my husband & I expressed our disapproval but didn't put too much stock into it because we figured they'd be together for a few months and that would be that. My other daughter and nieces are all smart girls who went through a similar phase and ended up settling with educated young men with good futures. No real cause for concern.

This boy is not well-educated, does not have family values, goes out partying all the time, gets blackout drunk with his buddies. He is a loser. I have friends who know his parents and have heard very negative things about their family. Note: I don't believe he is abusive or horrific any way, just not the kind of guy you want your daughter marrying.

Anyways, without anyone's support my daughter decides to go to India and marry this guy. They are not legally wed in the United States however in our community it's only the religious ceremony that matters so they're considered husband & wife. 

My daughter is 21 and has 3 more years left of school (one more for her bachelors, two more for an advanced degree that'll set her up for her dream job). She's moved out to her in-laws (it's customary in Punjabi culture for the girl to go live with her husband's family). She said she can pay for her phone, car note, everyday expenses, etc. with her husband's money while she finishes up school. The only thing she asked if we can keep her name on our medical insurance policy. My husband is a physician at a hospital so we get great coverage there. She wants to stay on our policy for another 3-4 years until she's graduated from college and has enough money to host a big wedding party in the US and then officially sign a marriage certificate."		1	0
c3nau8	2019-06-22 08:36:09	mustytomato	WIBTA for asking people to park their bikes elsewhere?	"So for a bit of context: I live in a capital city in Scandinavia, meaning there are bikes everywhere - and a lot of people thinking they are the center of the universe. 

I bike to the subway every morning and put my bike near a small shopping center, which has plenty of bike racks along the side, plus a huge two-story bike park just on the other side. The side of center seems to be the preferred parking spot for many, since it’s closer to the street and much easier to just drop your bike there, which is what many do. 

Problem is, there isn’t a lot of space along the sidewalk when the racks and surrounding area fills up with bikes parked all willy-nilly. Especially in the summer, people will just park their bikes directly on the sidewalk or often block other’s bikes, just so they don’t have to walk the extra 50 steps to the park. It drives me insane to see this daily, as I often have to move some bikes to get to my own and generally just hate to see how selfish and lazy they are. 

There’s also a lot of blind and elderly people in the area that frequent the shopping center and they often have trouble navigating the sidewalks because of all the bikes sticking out. As we also often have heavy winds, many of the free parked bikes fall down and obstruct the sidewalk as well. 

Now, I have a principle of not inserting myself where I’m not wanted, i.e. parking somewhere else if there’s no room at my usual spot, but I also realize many don’t care about that. I really want to say something to some of those, who just throw their bike wherever if I see them, but I’m also apprehensive of being a “bike police”, since it’s culturally not very well received to point out other’s bad behavior, no matter how kindly. 

So, WIBTA if I asked random strangers to put their bikes somewhere else?"	Asshole	0	0

c3nahf	2019-06-22 08:34:44	Kaaaaale56	AITA for wanting to get rid of our kittens?	"Alright, so when we moved into our apartment my wife begged me to get a cat.  I kept telling her I'm not a cat person, blah blah blah. So after her asking all the time, I finally relent and apparently it's the perfect timing because her friend is getting rid of one. Great.

Fast forward to the day she goes to get the cat. Instead, she comes home with not one, but two kittens. They're cute and curious and all that jazz and her and our 2-year old daughter love them and I won't lie, after a bit I'm warming up to them too.

Here's where things goes wrong; turns out, the previous owner never bothered to get shots or anything taken care of. So we find out the kittens have fleas. Yippee. I also find out that I'm apparently allergic to something that had to do with their claws or something because every time I get scratched by either of them, it swells like a bug bite and itches like one. I thought they were the fleas but it's not.

2 months later, she still hasn't made any effort to get the cats their shots, they haven't been to a vet, they still have fleas and they knock shit off everywhere and it's my responsibility to clean it up. I can feel my blood pressure rise when it comes to the cats. I tried to express that to my wife before we got the cats but she had her heart set on getting one but this situation turned out a lot different than I expected.

c3n9d5	2019-06-22 08:30:33		AITA FOR NOT WANTING TO BE WITH MY BOYFRIEND BECAUSE HE YELLED AT ME?	So i lost my license for two months. It been really hard.  I never used transit in my life and live in the boonies where the closet bus stop is a 50 min walk and skytrain is a 45 min car ride. My work and school is about a 45-60 min drive depending on traffic. I would have to take a few buses and would take approx  3-4 hours to get there. My bf lives 35 mins away by car, he usually came and got me and took me places because my parents are always working. We did that for about 2 weeks. We have been together for 2 years. Me and my boyfriend broke up it was really hard i felt really depressed especially because i couldn’t go and do stuff to take my mind off it as well with having to transit everywhere. I did that for about 1 week myself. I couldn’t take it anymore so i lied to my parents and started driving very safely. I didn’t make this post so anyone can tell me how wrong and stupid it is to drive without a license because i know. I know what the consequences would have been if i was to get caught. Anyways i work full time graveyards and school full time Monday -Friday as well with volunteer on Wednesday nights. I started driving with lots of caution. Today is Friday and i got my license back Monday technically i didn’t get it back yet because i have to go into the drivers office to pay the fees to get it back. With my school, final today and work i haven’t had the chance to go sit a drivers office because i know with the wait it usually can take up to three hours or more. Me and my bf got back together after a two been of being separated. I already got everyone i got it back as a lie so i just continued driving with caution. He knew i was doing that and didn’t say anything about it until we went to dinner tonight. He asked me when i’m getting it back i told him i have to go to office and get it but haven’t had time. He started saying how stupid and dumb i was for doing that and that i’m very stupid and dumb for not going and getting it back and that i should of done it the day of i got it back.		1	0
c3n8kg	2019-06-22 08:27:48		AITA-to my parent	"This happened sometime back and is ongoing, and I was wondering if I am the asshole here.
So me, and my parent have been  poor ever since my other parent died long back. And my living  parent ( referred from here on as P) has worked really hard to provide for me.
I want to emphasize that P worked really hard but we were still poor.(being poor is expensive)
 So I being the older one got a job right after graduation and is now making ok money for my age. Since P is still really poor , I send them some money every month to help ease the situation. This has been going on untill a non emergency situation arises in the house where P lives and since it is a family home(one other person lives there), my other relatives and P chipped in  to meet with the situation.
I can assure you this was a renovation which was not needed at all ,yes it made the house look better  but this was not necessary.
The fact is I never liked this house even though I grew up in it and I told them that they should not go through with this renovation. I didn't explicitly say I will cut off the monthly payments but I clearly said that my money will not be used for this.
And now because they went through with this, I don't give them money anymore.

However P claims that it is her money she used( she gave her savings) and what I give her is for her living expenses.
But I feel that indirectly it is my money she used.
So AITA here for cutting off P s payments after they did the renovation.

PS: THINGS TO CONSIDER 
-they need the money
-they worked hard all their life to raise me
-I don't live in the said house but the renovation was not absolutely necessary."		1	0

c3n5nb	2019-06-22 08:16:44	asdf2756753	AITA for venting to my friends about my father.	"A bit of context; My parents split when i was at a young age 2-3. My father smokes and TBH, hasnt had the best opportunities due to the financial state of his side of the family. This story takes place over a few months. I will list the events in order. I know im TA but just wanted conformation.

1. My grandmother is picking me up from my mothers place. She asks if Im hungry, i reply yes, she asks if there were any good places nearby and I said yes. I tell her where to go and she turns her car the other way in the intersection. I overreact to my grandmother not taking my recommendation seriously. (I have ADD/ADHD and those of you that take adderal know that you get ticked off at the slightest of things)

2. Me, stressed out starts texting my friend about how she took a left when she was supposed to go right. I assumed it was because she would rather eat at Burger King than a local restaurant because of financial problems. She lives the same town my father lives in over 100 miles away from where my mother lives where the standard quality of living seems rather low.

3. I text some things to my friend about how much my Father makes, I honestly didnt see much in him at that point. I realized that because he smoked around me when i was little, he probably was my leading cause of athsma. He had recently gotten a DUI with a family of 5 waiting for him to come home, the whole shebang. 

4. I instantly regret what i said, I shouldn't have used his income as an excuse for him being worse of a parent.

5. A few months later I bring my phone to his place. He must have figured out my backup pattern if my fingerprint recognition doesnt work. On fathers day morning he flushes my phone out completely. I think he's kinda insecure about my judgement but thats not what im here about.

6. That same morning he takes me to a park and yells at me for hours. Thats an exageration. The first bit was yelling, the second bit was talking about life. 

We are on good terms but some conversations are awkward because I might say something money related.

c3n4he	2019-06-22 08:12:36		AITA for getting annoyed at my girlfriend because she took a pill at a rave?	"Hey guys, thisll just be short. I'm trying to get my thoughts together so I approach this properly so I decided to come here for what people are saying. 

Context: I have been abusing various drugs for the past year and am only now beginning to come sort of clean. I have experienced the ups and downs of drug abuse and seen and done things that are regrettable. Trying to get fully sober is proving to be extremely difficult as all the problems in my own head that I was 'self medicating' because of are now finally coming to light. This coupled with the fact that im going through this pretty much in secret is making this quite the challenge. A challenge I can overcome, but a challenge none the less. 

Regardless, my girlfriend who I love dearly has little to no experience with drugs and is an innocent and sweet girl. 

Last night I had to go see my family who live out of country and my girlfriend went out raving with some of her friends. Then, at around 4am (I was still awake, after a year of using opiates and xanax to sleep its super tough to actually sleep now) I started getting videos from her of the rave. It looked fun and all and I was glad she was having a good time, but I noticed immediately her pupils were dilated and how fast she was talking. 

The next morning I called her and we spoke for abit and she told me that she took a pill with her friend at the rave. I have no clue why, but this really effected me strangely and I got surprisingly annoyed.

The thing is, I feel a fucking huge hypocrite about being annoyed at her for doing a small amount of drugs, especially since shes been watching me in horror slowly spiralling into addiction the past months. At the same time, I'm still concerned.

I'm thinking about just writing her a small note about why it set me off and just warning her of the dangers, especially with pressed pills and shit like that. 

At the same time I feel like its not my place to tell her what she can or can't do, especially considering my own actions in recent time. 

The last thing I want to be is some hypocritical, controlling boyfriend, but I'm unsure of how to approach this without seeming that way. I love her to the moon and back and I just want her to be safe and happy. Any help would be appreciated <3

I live in a house with two other roommates, Linda and mike. 

recently mike has taken a liking to Australias politics, I have no issues with that. the only issue I have is that he constantly plays the political podcasts through the main Bluetooth speaker, meaning that if I want to cook anything in the kitchen I have to endure a podcast about the liberal party. 
he is the only one who uses the main speaker as it's normaly only used for partys. 

Linda also finds it annoying and agreed that we need to ask him to stop. 

I finally decided to ask him to not play the podcasts  through the speaker as they are kinda annoying and both me and Linda are not a fan of them. I suggested headphones as an alternative. 
this caused mike to get angry and storm off Into his room I then got a message from him calling me a bitch.

"I live in a thriving metropolis and it’s not unusual to spend 20+ minutes looking for a parking space. I rented a Car2Go to run some errands and spent the last 10+ minutes of the rental looking for a place to park. I finally found a parallel spot on the street. As I turned off the car and gathered my belongings, a man on the sidewalk approached the car and started talking to me through the window. I’d seen him on the sidewalk when he pulled up, but it looked like he was waiting for an Über. 

He asked me, “Are you parking here?” 

I replied, “Yes.”

He told me, “I’ve been saving this spot for a friend.”

I’ve never seen someone save a parking spot on the street for another person, so I asked, “What?”

He told me he was saving the spot for a friend. I said, “I’m not sure that’s how it works.” He told me it was. I asked him if he wanted me to move and he said he’d hopped out of his friend’s car to save the spot, because there’d been cars behind him. I said I’d been looking for a spot for a while, my rental was running, and I didn’t want to hunt for another parking spot. 

He said he didn’t want to parking spot anymore and that I was an asshole. His friend pulled up towards the end of our exchange, so they rode off together. 

Looking back, I can see why I was an asshole to them. In my defense, he never asked me to move, and he was annoyed with me for parking from the start. If he’d explained the situation right away and been polite, I would’ve given him the spot. It was the end of a long day, and his request seemed ridiculous to me.

c3mus0	2019-06-22 07:36:53	throwaway153865390	AITA for asking my friends to delete/remove/block my ex-fiancé from social media?	"Throwaway account because some of my friends frequent Reddit, including this sub. 

*For the benefit of you readers it’s worth knowing I don’t have any social media anymore. Facebook went years ago and Instagram was the last to go just before we broke up. 

Okay so: I came out of a huge relationship around Christmas time. I had been with my fiancé for nearly nine years when she finally called time on it 6 months ago. The relationship ended mostly on good terms however it was decided we should no longer keep in touch as it complicates things. 

Obviously with such a long relationship (pretty much my entire 20s) there comes the issue with my friends and family still seeing her life on social media. In particular, Instagram. I didn’t pay much thought to this until my best friend said last week ‘It looks like (insert ex’s name) is doing well, it looks like she finally bought a house’. My heart sank as he also mentioned our two dogs who she now has. I loved those dogs and miss them a lot. 

Anyway, cut to a few nights ago and I’m laid in bed getting angry that my friend (and others before him) we’re giving me unwanted updates on my ex. My conclusion? Start asking everyone to remove her from their social media, including my mum and sisters etc. This is where the trouble started, my friend refused to but said he would maybe cool it on the the updates. My sisters also refused as they said they like seeing the dog updates and such. Petty arguments ensued with no progress or reasoning on how it makes me feel. Another friend said I shouldn’t care and that I’m coming across strange.

I guess my question is AITA? My major fear here is that I’m being controlling of other people’s lives but when it affects me directly I can’t help it. Should I just accept the situation?

Edit: This may not make a huge difference to the outcome of this post but the friends I’m referring to aren’t exactly mutual friends with my ex. They’re my close friends from home who knew and met her when we visited my home city but mostly never knew her that well. Family: fair game. I haven’t asked our real mutual friends to delete her from SM."	Asshole	0	0

c3ms1y	2019-06-22 07:27:07		AITA for getting mad at my(f18) bf(m18) for putting a picture of him and me on his Instagram	My boyfriend of a little over 1 year doesn’t have any pictures on his Instagram, so he posted one post with multiple pictures. We just graduated high school so he posted the memories of his senior year. He posted a picture of me and him at prom which I did not approve of. He posted this without my permission, and I didn’t like it because I don’t like my face being on the internet. I got mad and told him to remove it, however he didn’t want to because it was a memory that happened during the senior year. So instead of listening to me and just removing the picture he pulls up a picture on Instagram that has been posted months ago, it was me and the person that I used to like taking a picture at the prom. He says “how come you let him post a picture with you” and I know he is insecure about that picture. I told him that the lighting was better and I looked better with my ex-crush so I was okay with it. He is mad at me now, AITA?	Asshole	1	0

c3mrfo	2019-06-22 07:24:56		AITA for charging my dad for a birthday present he broke?	"I know that the title sounds pretty self-explanatory, but I still want to elaborate.
So, a couple of years ago I received a cheap (by normal standards) breadmaking machine from my mom for my birthday, since she knows I love to make my own stuff. She had been unemployed for years and still is, and while it’s fairly cheap for “normal people” to afford one, to her it cost her a fair bit more relatively. The gift had more sentimental value to me too, since it’s from my mom. 

If there’s one thing to know about me, it’s that i’m super forgetful. Chances are likely that I will forget about 90 percent of things I need to do. This includes cleaning out the bread maker. This is, among other things, one of the many many pet peeves my dad has. He will often get really frustrated if I forget once more to do my chores around the house. So one day, when I forgot to clean out the bread maker again, we got into a heated argument about something else later. In a fit of rage he decides it’s a smart idea to hurl the machine at me while I was in the hallway, just to remind me to “clean out the bread maker”. This didn’t break it, thank god. But because this time of the year is really busy (exams and all) I didn’t have time to use the bread maker anymore. And because it (a *black* machine) lied on the hallway floor (which is black) I never noticed it anymore and I forgot about it once again. 

So some time goes by and it still lays there on the floor. My dad decided he has enough of it and throws the machine out while I’m at school. It is on,y now that I find out and confront him about it. His argument is that “I should’ve picked it up again and cleaned it if you want it so bad”, while not realizing (or forgetting, ironic) that this bread maker was a birthday gift from my mom which held great sentimental value. She can barely afford such a thing but still bought it for me because she knows I love baking. After that I decided to send my dad a payment request for the machine, since I believe that he is the one that should buy me a new machine. Even though it feels justified, I can’t help but feel like that was a petty thing to do.

Yes, I forgot to clean it out at times, yes that was stupid of me but I don’t do that on purpose. He doesn’t have the right to take matters i to his own hands and just toss something in the trash what belongs to me. 
Am I the Asshole for expecting my dad to pay back something he destroyed because of my actions?

TL;DR: I expect my dad to pay the damages to a machine he broke because I didn’t clean it out often enough, even though this machine was a birthday gift from my mom which held great sentimental value."		1	0

c3mnt3	2019-06-22 07:11:59		AITA for smoking more cigarettes than my husband, yet he eats a fuck ton more than me?	"Obviously ESH because we smoke.  Yet my husband gets really pissy that I smoke more than him. 

I've never told him that he can't buy his dream boat, truck, whatever... We can afford it, so definitely,  make it happen. 

Yet he nickels and dimes me on petty ass shit.   I'm not fancy,  I shop at thrift stores and primarily buy all groceries at Aldi's. 

Anyway, based on context,  he's probably the asshole because he smokes too, and spends way more of our expendable income on his toys. 

Here's where I'm almost truly the asshole.  This beautiful man, love of my life,  he literally eats about 3x what I do.   And yeah, he's morbidly obese, but I love him in whatever size. 

So when he bitches about how many cigarettes I'm smoking compared to him, and that it's hard for him to quit if I'm smoking... I respond with the fact that I've gained 20 lbs since getting married and he eats 3x what I do,  so how does he have room to complain? 

If he's willing to make a dietary change, then I'll make a smoking change. 

Yet he acts like I'm body shaming him.   He's 6 foot and 350.   He's a  really big (fat) dude. I'm saying that so you know it's not because he's ripped.   He's totally not. 

My doctor friends say his obesity is likely to kill him before smoking will. 

So AITA for not actively trying to quit smoking until he makes a lifestyle choice to lose weight?"		1	0

c3mjp5	2019-06-22 06:58:04		AITA for eating seafood around my vegan girlfriend?	"So for context, I was vegan for 3 years and recently switched to a pescatarian diet that excludes dairy and land animal meat. My girlfriend has been vegan for 6 years and when we met about 3 years ago, I had just gone vegan. We bonded greatly over being vegan and having similar ethics, health interests, etc. 

I decided to make the switch to a pescatarian diet because I became a “junkfood” vegan and binged often on chips and other unhealthy stuff. The added protein from seafood and larger diversity of food has helped me get back on track. 

However, the switch has not sat well with my girlfriend. She initially said I should do whatever I had to do in order to be healthy, but now she’s increasingly getting hostile because she says it’s “disgusting” that I eat seafood around her. It should be known she’s not one of “those” vegans who shames non vegans. She doesn’t force her ethics on others, accept me because I’m her boyfriend and she feels she has the right.  I didn’t really eat seafood often around her, but we are currently on holiday to Hawaii and the seafood here is heavenly and if I’m gonna spend thousands on a trip, I want to indulge in the local seafood cuisine. I’ve probably had seafood 6/11 meals thus far. She says I’m a selfish asshole because I “ruined” our vegan bond and I’m a bigger asshole for making her uncomfortable by eating fish in front of her. She says she has every right to tell me to stop eating fish because it’s unethical and unhealthy. (The unethical point I concede but seafood such as salmon, shrimp and crab are all healthy). I keep asking her if me eating seafood is a dealbreaker for her in terms of whether or not she wants to be with me. She doesn’t really give a straight answer but she leans toward it not being a dealbreaker. Am I the asshole for eating seafood in front of her?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c3mij9	2019-06-22 06:54:04		AITA for offering to clean the bathroom?	"(Keep in mind that I’m 14. Idk just in case.)

So me and my mom have a weird relationship. One minute we’re having fun together and the next we’re arguing about who said what. And that happened tonight. (Please keep in mind that my mom is high rn, and she gets like this whenever she’s high or drunk.) 

So we were talking and we decided to go buy stuff for nachos. On our way to the store, we were laughing and having fun. Then after picking out everything, we went to go pay at the self checkout and I asked her if it was okay if I cleaned the bathroom for $20. She seemed to take offense by this and started on a “well why don’t you just clean it for free? Nobody ever does anything nice for me!” rant.

Now, look. The problem with me cleaning the bathroom for FREE is that it is absolutely DISGUSTING. Whenever we run out of toilet paper, we have to use paper towels. The problem is that we can’t flush them because they might clog the toilet, so we put them in a paper bag to throw away later. Except, whenever the bag overflows with the paper towels, my brother decides it’d be a good idea to just throw his shit covered paper towels underneath the medicine cabinet/dresser. He’s 16 by the way.

Do you see the problem? I’m not going to clean a bathroom that smells like shit so bad that you can taste it, FOR FREE. When I asked her how she felt about it, It was just straight into victimizing herself, so that I would feel bad, and comply. She does this A LOT when she’s drunk/high. And don’t get me wrong, I love my mom to death, and she doesn’t get high/drunk often, but this is a problem and it doesn’t help with my depression. Being constantly put down and forced to feel ashamed of myself for something I said has taken a toll on my mental health.

I’m going to bring up her behavior at my next therapy session, and she’s going to be in the room with me and my therapist.

Sorry, I got off track, anyways, we were driving back home when she asked “let me know if you see any parking spaces!” In a joking manner, because earlier we were having a convo about how she always has to park in a different space to get home. I quickly saw a parking space, and she got upset. She said that I was being rude because I only called out the parking space while we were already passed it, but I had only seen it while we passed it. (It’s 10 pm at this point and dark as heck.) I tried to explain this to her and she interrupted me with an “OK! ANYWAYS, let’s go upstairs and play with the cat and make nachos, THEN we can have a good time.” 

Bitch what

She completely made me feel like I had done something wrong, and I was so confused. This is common behavior of her though, and she’s good at it. I tried to tell her that she was being rude by interrupting me and she says “oh, yeah, IM the rude one.” 

Please help me understand what I did wrong here. Should I apologize? There’s more to the story, but I think this is a good enough explanation. Let me know if you do want to hear the rest though."		1	0

c3mg43	2019-06-22 06:46:03	CodingSheep	AITA for Wanting to at Least Know Why Someone was Banned from a Student Organization Discord?	"First post on this thread for something that happened within the past 24 hours so bear with me.

&#x200B;

For context, I am a DM for a D&D Adventure's League run at a college I just graduated from this past Spring (They're letting me stay as a DM and I was originally planning on leaving after the next campaign this upcoming Fall Semester). Last night, I noticed 2 announcements in the discord: One was from my friend who was promoted to Club Staff who stated that guidelines were being updated and to please follow them (which is fine by me). The other was from the head of the overarching gaming organization that runs all of the school's e-sports teams essentially stating that Anti-LGBTQ+ behavior and talk will not be tolerated in the community. What shocked me is that this guy isn't even a staff member of the Adventure's League and that his announcement in particular caught me off guard. I then noticed that one of the DMs (Let's call him Richard) was no longer in the community discord without any indication of what happened.

&#x200B;

So I started asking several staff and moderators ""Hey, can I ask what happened to Richard? I assume he did something wrong but I want to know at least how severe it is. He is currently in 2 campaigns I DM and I am a player in a campaign he DMs so if he did something severe, I would like to know so that I can remove myself from him as well as protect my players from him if necessary."" Their only response was that they didn't want me to talk about it to protect all parties involved as it was a ""sensitive issue."" I kept bothering them for about 2 hours and eventually, I got my answer as to how severe what Richard said was and I did remove him from both campaigns as well as left the one he runs this morning. However, I have a feeling they only told me what happened just to get me to shut up, as one of the staff members berated me in a private message about how I shouldn't be trying to interfere in a private matter such as this.

&#x200B;

Part of me wants to submit a formal letter to the school with complaints of this incident, but that's just the stress and anxiety talking, I swear.

&#x200B;

Now, I probably don't know the full story and I wouldn't be surprised, but am I the asshole for wanting to at least get some basic information, prodding the community staff members constantly for it, and wanting to get the club in trouble with the school for withholding it?

&#x200B;

EDIT: To clarify, the roles of the Discord Server are Club Staff > Discord Moderators > DMs > Players. The issue was only kept and known to the Club Staff and Discord Moderators without any DMs or Players being told what happened."	No A-holes here	0	0

c3mepa	2019-06-22 06:41:18	pepper701	AITA for ending a friendship of 5 years?	"I cut ties with my friend of 5 years a few days ago. We have had a very rocky friendship and have “ended” it many times. Whenever he has a problem with me, he does not tell me. He either shuts me out completely and when I ask what’s going on he typically says “I rather not say”. We got through these rocky times and he did feel like a very close person to me, like family. He was there for me when I was going through bad times and vice versa.

A few days ago we hung out, my mother called me and asked where I was. I told her I was with my best friend and she asked where my boyfriend was, because usually me and my boyfriend hang out or my boyfriend hangs out with me and my best friend. I was tired that day and all I said was “He’s busy or something that’s why I didn’t”, even though I knew in fact he was not busy, I wanted to hang out with just my friend and I knew my friend preferred that, I don’t know why I said that. 

Apparently my best friend heard this and felt like he was a second choice. He didn’t tell me any of this, our mutual friend did. He never tells me when things bother him, only on occasion much later on when I’m already upset or unless I attempt to pry it out of him. Right after hanging out that day, he sends me a message saying he had fun but he thinks it’ll be the last time he’ll hang out with me alone without our mutual friend. I asked him why, he read it and ignored it and continued to message our group chat with our other friends, then an hour later I asked again and he said “he rather not say and maybe some day”. After being friends for five years and confiding in each other with so much, he still cannot tell me if I do something that bothers him. I unfriended him and sent a message essentially saying that he cannot change, that after all this time he still cannot tell me when he’s upset with something and he shuts me out and that if we cannot hang out alone it shows it doesn’t care, I said I am not going through a good time emotionally and that I need friends who care, and then I said I wished him the best. He responds with exactly this: “and I, you”. Later on, our mutual friend wanted to do a phone call with the three of us but I refused. He messaged me (because our mutual friend begged him to) and he asked if I wanted to talk and clear the air as he “didn’t want to leave any stones unturned and he was not messaging me to reconcile the friendship”. I ignored it as I thought it was so condescending. He has never apologized or attempted to mend anything so I feel I made the right choice, but I am uncertain if I was being dramatic. After all, it had been 5 years of friendship and we had been close and I can’t help but wonder if you’re supposed to continue being a supportive friend even with all the struggles. I actually feel kind of free now yet I feel confused as well. AITA for ending our friendship?"	Not enough info	0	0

c3me3b	2019-06-22 06:39:09	GradeATractor	AITA for wanting to host a smaller gathering before my birthday party?	"For my 31st birthday I'll be having a big party at my house with dinner and drinks starting at 5pm or so.  My girlfriend asked what I wanted to do before then, and I said maybe invite my poker group over for an afternoon game ending at 5.  She said absolutely not: someone at the main party might find out there was just a smaller gathering that they weren't invited to and be offended.

If I have the poker game that day, she says I have to invite everyone I invited to the birthday party (this is unfeasible because my table only has space for 8).

She asked me how I would feel going to a birthday party and realizing there was a smaller pre-party I wasn't invited to.  I said that honestly wouldn't bother me at all; it's just like attending a wedding where I wasn't invited to the rehearsal.

She suggested I could host the poker game the previous night, but then the outer tier is just as excluded and I'm asking my poker friends to make an extra trip.  And someone might still be just as offended if they overhear there was a poker game yesterday they weren't invited to.

I'll nix the poker game idea since it clearly bothers her, but I still don't understand why that would make me an asshole.  You can't always guard everyone in your life against small amounts of awkwardness."	Not the A-hole	0	0

(so my friend still needs to improve on her studies to get into the desired course)

during the 1 month long holiday (that ends in july), we were assigned a lot of homework and this holiday is the last holiday before our exams, so this would be the best time for us to study. during the holidays, we didn’t really talk much during the holidays, and since my friend doesn’t really have self control, i try to message her and ask her about her progress in doing homework.

i’m really quite worried about her because i’m scared that if she doesn’t buck up during the holidays, we wouldn’t be able to get into the course together. but during the holidays she’s been going out to drink with other friends, getting to know even more people to the point where i feel like we’re drifting apart.

everytime i ask her about her homework, she gets irritated because she didn’t do any. i’ve tried to explain to her that i’m genuinely concerned for her, and she says thanks, but she doesn’t take any action to work hard for our national exams.

and she says she doesn’t want to talk to me because i keep making her sad by reminding her of the homework she hasn’t done.

(my bathroom is inside my bedroom) My parents will come into my room at night from 12am  - 3am about once a week to check if im asleep for whatever reason. They throw partys very often and one time i was using my bathroom and i heard someone come into my bedroom and i said ""dont come in"" and they still came into the bathroom and walked in on me using the crapper.   


I have asked for a lock multiple times and they always shoot me down before i can even say anything. Once i tried to buy a lock and my dad said if i installed that he would break down my door. I do online school so i spend most of my day in my room but my parents come into my room 3-4 times a day without knocking and rearrange stuff even when i ask them not to. Also sometimes they will sit down on my couch for hours even when i say i want them to leave. I am 17 and last week at 5am my mom came into my room and snuck under the covers. I dont remember any of it but she told me the next day that i was screaming to get out and she found out i sleep naked.  


Im really losing my shit living with them and i dont know what to do. I would say fuck it and get a lock anyways but i live in the woods and the closest home depot is a hour and a half bike distance.

I have a 10 month giant breed dog that I've had since she was just 2 month old and I want the best for her and she will always come first in my life. To me, she is family. As important as my parents in my heart. I've made that clear to people around me.

Now I've been with a girl for about 7 months and it's going great for the most part. We occasionally talk about moving in together once I graduate and have my real full-time job. The problem is that, even though she does find my dog cute, she's not a ""dogperson"" and she's never had a pet at home herself growing up. When we talk about moving in together with my dog, it definitly causes her anxiety. She says that finding peeing or fur on the floor would drive her crazy and that having saliva from drooling on her clothes disgusts her. She also said that, in spite of all that, she would accept my dog and try her best because she loves me and I am a good person and boyfriend.

I want to tell her that this is not enough. I want someone that I can trust with my dog when I'm not around. I want someone who loves my dog, because with dogs you receive what you give, and if she's annoyed or anxious when around my dog, my dog is going to know that and it's not gonna mesh well. And also, I'm most likely going to get another dog in a year or two, from the same breed. I'm always gonna have dog friends in my life, because it makes me happy.

I want to tell her that I appreciate the efforts she has said she is willing to make, but that it's not enough. I need a partner that will be good to my dog companions. If we will move in together permanently, I expect her to become a ""dogperson"" herself. And for me this is a dealbreaker.

At first I stayed with my mom for three years, then my dad for a year, and since then I've been with one during the school year and the other during the summer until last year. I was talking to a friend of mine about my homelife with my mom and she started getting really worried about some of the stuff I said-most vividly, my mom making and encouraging sexual comments between me and her boyfriend and at one point threatening me with a knife. They also said from the sound of it most of the things my mom has bought, usually directly after making me incredibly upset or threatening me, are bribes to keep me compliant. With my friend's support I told my dad and he came to get me immediately, threatening to go to court when my mom tried to stop him. I lived the rest of the school year, the summer, and this school year with him and I've been happier for it. Now he wants to send me back.

He's fallen on some serious financial troubles recently and he has a fiance with three kids of her own, so a fourth kid is hard for him to support right now. He wants me to go back with my mom for the summer so he can save money, work on his financials, and bring me back in six months. I don't want to go. I don't want to see my mom's creepy boyfriend, I don't want to deal with my mom's passive-aggressive abuse, and I don't want her to make me feel as small as I used to.

c3mazr	2019-06-22 06:28:37	anonymouse11223344	WIBTA if I told my brother-in-law’s fiancé he has a serious drug problem?	"Throw away account in case anyone in my family sees

My brother in law is in his mid twenties. His fiancé is a a few years younger than him. They have dated for about a year and he has now proposed and the wedding planning began right away and they will be married this year. My concern is that my BIL has a serious drug problem that his fiancé knows nothing about and I feel like I need to warn her.

Some background

BIL has always lived with his parents and has never been financially stable due to never being able to figure out what he wants to do. He bounces from job to job, parties way too hard, and is irresponsible. His hard partying has led to some very serious drug use and he has asked my husband for help on multiple occasions. We want to help but the help he asks for is most frequently is for my husband to give him some of his prescription medication to get him through the withdrawals easier. His drugs of choice are heroin, ecstasy, and anything else he can’t get his hands on.

The problem is he hides it so well and talks a good game and I know for a fact he has hidden this part of himself from his fiancé. His fiancé is in her early 20’s and a good Christian girl from a pretty well off family. She is college educated (BIL is not) and very beautiful and kind and generally wonderful. I also think she is young and naive and a little blind to the real world. I believe she met my BIL and, him being her first real boyfriend, has allowed herself to get swept up in getting married. I’m afraid that this young lady is going to marry my BIL and eventually he won’t be able to hide his drug use anymore and it is going to turn her world upside down. She is young and comes from a good family and could honestly do so much better than my BIL.

So...WIBTA if I told her the secrets he is hiding from her even if it could save her from a life of disappointment in the future?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3mado	2019-06-22 06:26:35	ihaventafather	AITA For Starting A fight With My Ex?	"To preface this I had a rocky relationship with this person for 6 months. She was honestly really horrible to me throughout the whole relationship, most people agree with me about this (including her friends). She would always take up literally all of my time and get angry at me whenever I had things to do or I wanted to spend time with my friends, as well as being very manipulative with me to get me to stay with her when I'd bring up how unhappy she'd make me. She also loved to act like her problems were the only important problems in the relationship and would entirely disregard my issues, and throughout the entire relationship she caused me to have many breakdowns (and then called me a ""crybaby"" afterwards).

So anyway I eventually got out of the relationship and tried to be as nice to her as I could. I tried to stay friends with her and for the first few days she begged me to get back with her and I declined every time. After a few days of her telling me I hated her and didn't care about her feelings, she made it impossible for me to try to be her friend anymore. I started hanging out with friends again and spent a lot of time with another girl, and then my ex started calling her a stupid whore and tried to make people hate her for nothing. Around the same time this happened, she told me that she had sex with someone who had a girlfriend and tried to get me to help her get herself out of it. I told her I didn't care and that it wasn't my situation, and the next day she called my mom to ask for a favor and then talked about how ""mean"" I was to her when all I said was that I couldn't have cared less about her getting with someone when she knew he had a boyfriend because I didn't do it. Also I didn't mention we decided to try to stay friends for a while and see if we could get back together later if she would decide to treat me better (in our last fight I made sure that she understood why I broke up with her and I don't think she could really push them off at that point).

I decided I didn't want to stay friends with her anymore and cut all contact with her. 

After that she wanted to get someone to jump me and tried to arrange it. This is why I decided to have another fight with her. I messaged her saying that it really didn't matter to me if I got jumped and that I wasn't scared of it happening. She responded saying that she ""would have had someone jump me but she isn't a stupid cunt"" and I said something along the lines of ""sure, you're not a stupid cunt lol"". Our fight continued for about 2 hours and it was really just her saying that I was a horrible person and that she was ""trying to make things better with me by talking"" and me responding with similar insults. I know that it was really childish of me to do so but I really didn't care at that point because of how badly she treated me.

I really can't tell if I'm the asshole here just because I know I could have addressed it much better and probably just shouldn't have said anything at all."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c3m7m2	2019-06-22 06:17:36		WIBTA for exposing that my ex lied to/cheated on her current boyfriend?	"This one is kinda complicated.

Background, as short as I can: I met a girl in high school. We became best friends. We then dated for a while. I did somethings, mostly being neglectful, that pushed her away. We broke up when she moved to a new college a couple years after high school but we still talking every day. We continued to do so right up until about a week ago when she moved in with the guy she's been seeing casually all year, at which point she blocked me on snapchat to hide from him that we were marked #1 best friends and stopped answering my messages.

Fast forward to today, it's been a week and I haven't talked to her. I should mention that when it comes to this girl I'm admittedly a little crazy. I have no justification other than that for what I did. Basically, she still shared her location with me and I showed up at her old house because I knew she was visiting. I found out incidentally but after I knew somehow I couldn't stop myself. Obviously she did what any normal person would do in that situation and pretended not to notice me and then blocked me on everything but email.

We had a pretty strong bond at one point but I honestly have no idea what she felt about me before tonight and I don't know if now she'll ever want to even think about me again. Now she's staying with this other guy and I've basically forced myself out of her life. But here's the question.

Ever since she started seeing this guy, she's been telling him, or at least implying, that they were exclusive. Mostly, she's been saying she hasn't been sleeping with me. I happen to have proof this isn't true, plus plenty of messages to the same effect. This guy has a sore spot for cheating and there's at least a 70% chance they would break up if he knew.

If I ever have a chance to get her back this could kill it. I know that. But I can't stand the idea that she's basically replaced me by lying to someone else, someone she's said multiple times shares many remarkable similarities to me, and I don't know if she'll ever even talk to me again as it is. So should I send him the photos?"	Asshole	1	0
c3m5i5	2019-06-22 06:10:46	SaveHerPlease	AITA for stopping my girlfriend for gifting me something expensive because I didn't want it	"Alright so, a bit of back story on our relationship. We've been together for 7 months and we're in a long distance relationship.

My birthday is today and my girlfriend has been insisting on getting me a present. After a ton of a reluctance, I gave in because I thought it was rude if I said no.

After a while she asked me what I wanted and I said I think that something for our relationship would be nice. I settled on the Bond Touch bracelet but she said that it was too expensive (and I agreed because it was $100). I tell her I'm out of ideas so she has full reign on the gift as long as she tells me what it is.

A couple of weeks go by and she sends me a link to a hoodie. I'm not really fashion forward but I know she is so I trusted her judgment. I asked her how much it was and she refused to tell me so I got antsy and looked it up. I couldn't find a listing that wasn't $150 or above.

I was a bit ticked off that she overlooked what I wanted because it was too expensive and then decided to find something even more expensive that I had no interest in. She noticed that something was off and I told her how I felt. She got standoffish and deleted the link.

I talked to my friends about it and they think I was a major asshole about things because I should have been happy either way. Thoughts?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

When my girlfriend's (let's call her Lola) cousin skipped town leaving Lola's mom will all of her bills, a car payment, and a missing cat, Tom in all of his wisdom thought it would be a good idea to keep talking to the cousin after she skipped out.

 Now, after a month or so of not talking to Tom, I try and patch things up with him. We stay friends, and I then try and fix things between them slowly. Now it should be noted that I am fresh out of high school, And I work a very bad job. My dad offers me a place to stay free of charge, as long as I pay the bills. Its nothing spectacular. Just an old trailer we used to live in. But in order to save money I invite my friend Tom to live with me if he pays half of the bills. 

When I finally get them to talk, he tells her this and lola gets pissed. Shes still really mad at Tom for talking to her cousin (who is a total bitch that her entire family hates.)

c3m2iv	2019-06-22 06:01:22	MockingGary	AITA for being super petty and making everybody stay downstairs at work an extra 20 minutes?	"  For background : I work as a night hygiene chargehand at a food processing factory, we run two departments, essentially cooked meats and uncooked meats, I was in the uncooked side running on a barebones team, whilst cooked meats had a full compliment of staff.  On Saturday mornings we let everybody go upstairs 30 minutes before the end of shift to relax before the weekend. 

  Everything was going particularly well during the shift and it was looking like everything was going to be cleaned early and I'd end up having 4 of my 6 staff stood around for around 90-120 minutes before end of shift twiddling their thumbs, being proactive, I prepared a large dolav of pots to clean, pretty much just metal pots with lids that the meat is packed into before cooking, which often need soaking and scrubbing to remove baked on product debris.

  Knowing how cooked meats section runs, and the staff they had, I knew they'd be ahead of time and looking for extra work, so I asked my counterpart in cooked meats (a relief-chargehand) if they could send me one or two people to help out scrubbing these pots, they laughed, said no, they're busy and walked off.  Thinking he was joking, I went back downstairs and started to help my team with pots.  

  15-20 minutes pass and nobody arrives from cooked meats, I radio across and ask for somebody, he thinks I'm joking and laughs across, I explain we need a little help and that cooked meats can't go upstairs earlier than usual on Saturday until uncooked side was also finished.  He was hesitant but sent over two people 10 minutes later.

  Now comes the time we usually finish and my team have around 5 minutes of work left, I couldn't get hold of my counterpart, so I go wondering around the locker room looking for the other team, low and behold they're upstairs relaxing, I told my counter, I wasn't joking about nobody going upstairs early and everybody must come down to uncooked before we can leave.  He fired back, that he sent me two people, I replied harshly with, '30 minutes after initially asking' and walked off.  In which if he sent the 2 people earlier, we'd have finished before usual time and none of this would happen. 

 Give it another 10 minutes and they all finally stroll down to uncooked and I sent everybody away to get ready for their weekend. 20 minutes after we usually go up.

  I understand the level of petty is high, but I wanted to prove a point to my counter that I wasn't joking and he should listen to his counter and that we all have to work together as a team.

c3m2fg	2019-06-22 06:01:08	brynleehollis	AITA for getting upset at my parents for kicking me out?	"Okay, to preface, I definitely didn't deserve getting kicked out. My brother and his wife adopted my sister (let's call her F) and I when I was 9 and she was 11 because they felt obligat- I mean, because god told them to. Okay, I know I sound snarky, but I'm pretty pissed off right now. I'm 17. Lets call my parents B and S (for brother and sister of course). S and B are both emotionally and physically abusive, but that's another story.

S told me I could go to a party if I got work off to go to trek. So, I go into work early and get the shifts off so I could go. S agrees I can extend my curfew and go, at this point not specifying when I would need to be home. After we're already on our way (the party is 45 minutes away and we all drove together), S tells me I need to be home by 11. There is NO WAY I can get home by 11. I try and explain this to S but she leaves me on read and ignores me all night. I texted her all night, trying to explain my dilemma, but she refuses to acknowledge my attempts, even ignores my calls. I don't end up getting home until 12:30ish. I'm freaking out, but they ignore me when I come home. I understand, this was a bad thing to do. I shouldn't have missed curfew, but I was in a tight spot.

The next day, S is driving me to play practice. She's taken away my phone and has been yelling at me all morning, ignoring all of my attempts to try and explain myself. So finally I just say, ""Fine, I won't be going to trek then. I kept up my part of the deal, and you won't even try and see my point of view."" And she gets PISSED. She pulls over and tells me she doesn't want to be my mom anymore and how ungrateful I am. So I get out of the car and walk to my nearest friend's house because I didn't want to say anything in the moment I might regret. I end up waiting a while at another friend's house until I felt it was safe. S doesn't say anything to me when I get home. So I grab my keys and go to work.

The next day, my whole family goes to Idaho to see my sister's baby blessing. We were supposed to go home, however, B and S decided to leave with everyone but me. B left me some (dirty) clothes but that was it. They've left me at my sister's house without anything. F has decided I'm just the biggest bother because I've asked her to send me more items to you know, live. She claims I'm being needy (it's literally been a week I have 3 pairs of underwear). AITA for asking for my stuff? I'm trying to get a job here but in order to work, I need my fanny pack (I'm a lifeguard) and she's like ""the world doesn't revolve around you, I might not send your fanny pack"" etc

Also, everyone outside of my family (my BF and his mom, my BFF and her parents, all of my friends from Utah, etc) agree that this is out of line and my parents absolutely can't just give me up like this. But, most of my extended family is on B and S's side, saying that it's fair for them to want a break and I'm overreacting for being mad. AITA for being mad about getting kicked out?"

"My husband texted me today asking if it would be ok for his mother and her boyfriend to stay with us while they are in town for a weekend. I love my mother in law and we get along great, but I don't think our apartment is big enough for four people comfortably. When I explained this to him he said that he had basically already told them they could. I pushed the issue and we told them no but I offered to pay for a hotel. Now my husband is mad at me and can't understand how I can be so unreasonable. 

For context, we live in a one bedroom loft style apartment. It opens into the kitchen and then goes into the dining and living area. Our bedroom is upstairs over the dining area and the only bathroom with a shower is attached to the bedroom. 

I think our schedules are also an issue. I'm usually up from 1pm to 5am and my husband is up from around 9pm to 12 pm. My inlaws are day time people. I don't think anyone would be sleeping well with all the noise that carries through the apartment.

c3m0mb	2019-06-22 05:55:11	moongellie	WIBTA if i told my boyfriends dad to get out?	"tomorrow i am sleeping over at my boyfriend house. i have done this once or twice before, and he has slept over at my house multiple times. the times i've slept over at his house i've never had any problems. they were fine letting us sleep in the bed together.

today his mom has found out we are sexually active. she made a comment like ""you guys are going to have to sleep on the couch"" and my boyfriend said ""why"" and she said ""i don't want you having unprotected sex. he said ""how do you know i'd have unprotected sex"" and she's like ""how would you get condoms"" he said ""i bought them with money like a normal person"".

now she most likely won't do anything about this. if she ends up communicating with his dad and he finds out he might be weird about it. he does this thing where he will randomly come into his room in the middle of the night to make sure he is sleeping. he doesn't do this when i'm over. my boyfriend is afraid that if he finds out he might start doing this when i am sleeping over.

now i am \*not\* okay with this. unlike him i've grown up with privacy in my house and i know for a fact if he comes into the room in the middle of the night i am going to be really pissed off.

if he does this i want to tell him to get out and that i am not okay with him doing this. the problem is i am not sure if it is in my right to say this and my boyfriend doesn't know either.

on one hand it is his house and i'm the guest, he runs things a certain way and is used to coming into his sons room in the middle of the night. on the other hand i think no matter where i am i still have a right to my privacy and even if his house runs a different way i shouldn't have to be barged in on in the middle of the night. i'm afraid if i were to tell him to get out though he would get mad at me. i know when he is alone with his family he can get very pissy easily. i also don't even know if this will happen anytime soon but i think eventually he will probably do it.

so i want to know, would i be the asshole if i told my boyfriends dad to get out and that i am not okay with him coming into the room in the middle of the night, even though he is used to being able to do this?

Edit: i think i should mention that although i use very blunt wording i wouldn't be aggressive in telling him to get out. it would more so be me telling him i'm not comfortable and asking him to leave. i'm terrible at confrontation in person.

edit: as per someones request i will include our ages here, 17

"If it wasn't for my dad's abuse and god awful parenting, I wouldn't be the immensely matured, self identified man I am today. He kept a roof over my head, he made sure i didnt go hungry. And now on top of all that, he's putting money out of his own pocket into fixing my car, which he bought for cheap after the old owner got in a wreck, and we don't live middle class, we're barely above poverty. 

He's an asshole to my mom, who can be an asshole with her temper but man she has a right to be, he's inconsiderate, abusive, threatens to be abusive, loud, and has a terrible fucking victim complex on account of his shit life and shit life decisions. 

But she works her ass off with him, struggling in and out of a filthy fucking mechanic shop, getting her hands black with grease and grime, carrying wrenches, hammers, jacks, bars, impact tools in and out of that office every day almost 7 days a week many times over 12 hours a day, and she's just as depressed as him. 

But me, I got out, I got a separate job, raised money for rent and a plane ticket and left, and I'm so fucking happy, I swear to you and god I'm so, so fucking happy to be gone, I love my freedom, I love that I'm not suffering there anymore, that I don't live with that FUCKING monster, in that house, with all those fucking dogs (we bred dogs for money btw) and ticks (we have a tick infestation btw) and roaches (we have a German roach infestation btw) and that mentally retarded sister who physically fucking punted me day in and out when I was little, up until I was big enough to defend myself. 

Tonight might be the last night I sleep here before I drive back up with my car. Earlier today I tried to discuss with my dad, my having left this city, and having left them there, and how he thinks it was the wrong decision. He made it clear, so painfully, *painfully* clear that he doesn't think he did anything wrong, that I need to grow up, let things go, that I'm an asshole, that I'm in denial about having made the wrong decisions. 

He threatened, for the 100th time almost, to ""take me out back and lay you flat on the fucking ground"" I stared him down in the eyes while he ranted away, beer in his hand, I didn't break from it, I stared into that man's eyes, who's approval and love I have so desperately longed for, for years, and I didn't feel a thing. ""*I quit on you, you're not my dad, I'm going to use you for this car and leave and never turn back, it's over*"" that's all that went through my head. My heart rate was idle, it wasn't like before, I knew he could and would woop my ass, but I wasn't heartbroken by it anymore, I just, I just realized that, this man is, just, wrong.

But despite this, my mother, her health fails, her arms are fat with what sometimes looks like arthritis, but she's not legal here, (working on it) and can't afford a doctor, and she has to work in that HELLHOLE.

c3luq5	2019-06-22 05:35:59	PoliticalBitch69	WIBTA if I threatened to throw out my roommate’s stuff?	"Okay so I (22F) have been living with my bf (23M) and his friend (23M) for the last year.

Roommate has been an absolute nightmare to live with. He’s really passive aggressive and never helps clean but always gets mad if the common area isn’t spotless (when he literally vomited in his room and didn’t ever clean it up).

In the last few weeks he’s gone from passive aggressive to just straight up aggressive and has been really mean to my bf and I about a variety of thing (including things he’s really self conscious about which super isn’t cool).

Our lease is over at the end of this month (thank god) but he moved out about a week ago without any notice. However, he’s left a TON of his stuff including small things like groceries to big things like one of his guitars, a bunch of shoes, and random stuff like a pile of razors. I assumed he would have gotten the rest of his stuff by now, but he literally hasn’t come back since he left.

My bf and I are moving out tomorrow with the exception some furniture we’re trying to sell but if we can’t sell it we’re gonna take it to goodwill on Wednesday (the 26th). We want to use the rest of the time in the lease to deep clean the apartment, getting all the places that get missed because of furniture or just get kind of forgotten about (like the top of the kitchen cabinets). And a lot of that cleaning will be trying to clean up his vomit stain, of the mold that’s been growing in his bathroom, or the grease he’s gotten all over the kitchen.

We know the roommate isn’t gonna help with anything given his track record, and it’s gonna be hard to clean with his stuff there. Additionally, we’ll get charged by the landlords if we leave belongings in the unit.

I know our lease isn’t technically over until the 30th, but it would be really hard to deep clean in a half day so  ideally every thing is gone by the 26th.

WIBTA for telling my ex roommate that we’re gonna throw his shit out by Wednesday if he doesn’t pick it up? Knowing him if I don’t he’ll wait till the last second or never pick it up at all and get mad it wasn’t hand delivered to him for his convenience."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3luoe	2019-06-22 05:35:50	Bigsillybo-i	AITA For uninviting a girl to the school ball	"As a bit of backstory, our highschool is pretty well known in our country, but despite having some of the top academic scores in the country for several years running, our students have been up to too much mischief, and our school ball gets axed for a few years running as a result. This year is the first in a while in which the school actually sponsors the event, meaning the police won't crash it after 30 mins of it starting. As a result, I'm able to go.

Backtrack to about 2 weeks back or so. Ball tickets on sale, and the event's in a month, so on the back of people's minds. I go to an arts performance tournament, if you will, where I can perform my thing with my group, but also get to meet people (read: girls. Unisex schools are fun) from other schools. A small group rocks up to play a game of cards, get their names, yadda yadda, and two of them friend me on fb. Not long after, one of them asks if I'm going to the ball, hadn't bought tickets by then, but was considering, and she asked if I were willing to take her friend. Now, I'm not the most socially clued in kid by any stretch, certainly not the partygoer type, but I know myself to be at least conventionally attractive on a good day. Given that the previous two years a girl's gotten a crush on me at these events, I assume the same for this one, too. As a result, I said yes, but would like to get to know her first. 

Starting the conversation with the girl who wants to go with me, I discover that she really just wants to +1 so she can hang out with friends, though clued in that she wanted to go to pre ball things with me. On discovering this, I declined to take her, despite having said yes previously, citing my reasoning that I thought she was interested in me, and not my position in being able to go to the ball. 

If it matters, we're all around the 16-18 age range, and apparently the first friend was ""super annoyed"" with the second friend as well.

I'm not perfect and sometimes eat his food, he has been annoyed at this before and let me know, but he also eats my food which I don't have an issue with.   


Last week he had some friend chicken in the fridge for two days I though he'd forgotten about, I ate one of the three pieces, and the next day told him ""hey man sorry I ate some of your chicken"", he became very annoyed and despondent, demanding a big apology. I bought him pizza as consolation. Anyway, yesterday he came home and I heard him eating something, he was munching for quite a while, when I asked him what he was eating he said this stuff on the stove, I had made stir fry and left one portion on he stove for my dinner, which he had helped himself to leaving me less than a portion.  


 I felt like he thought he was better than me, and that his rules on life only apply to others. After I spoke up and said why would you eat my dinner when you get so upset at me for eating old leftovers. He didn't apologise, and was like ""I only do it because you do, see it doesn't feel good does it"". It's annoying me that he expects people to behave a certain way but don't behave like that himself, and blamed me for him eating my food and basically turned the whole situation into my fault.   


I don't mind sharing, sharing is caring, but when someone throws a wobbly and then behaves like that themselves and won't look at their own behaviour it's frustrating. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c3ltpy	2019-06-22 05:32:42	Throwaway08192283	AITA for yelling / scolding my mom for falling down and getting hurt	"Yesterday, my mom (67) tripped and fell in her kitchen and fell flat on her face. I (27) witnessed the whole thing. She began screaming that something was broken and that she heard bones cracking in her head.

5 years ago she fell twice within 2 weeks (same thing of tripping over in the house and 2nd time falling on ice) which resulted in breaking her wrist twice over. She has tripped over herself a couple of times since but hasn’t gotten hurt. 

I was worried she broke her arm so I turned her over and she seemed fine other than a big goose egg on her forehead. She started saying she couldn’t think straight but was yelling about it to me, so I told her several times I would call the ambulance and she yelled not to and she needed time to think. So I waited and she wouldn’t stop  so I drove her to the ER. She had calmed down a bit by that time, and while driving her I yelled at her for falling down and hurting herself. 

I wasn’t trying to be mean, but I was upset she hurt herself. I told her “I can’t believe you fell again. You’re always falling” and raised my voice.  Me and her sometimes have dark/dry humor banter back and forth so that was part of me trying to be humorous in a dark way. She told me I was being rude but she didn’t dwell on it. I drove her to the ER, stayed with her 3 hours and we were fine. She ended up just having a concussion so nothing extremely serious. 

However she brought up to me on the way how I was mean for yelling at her. I told her it was just me trying to provide comic relief. AITA for yelling?"	Asshole	0	0

I have a friend who I've been relatively close with for the past 2 years and when we talk we're good friends  


However, over these past 2-3 years I've noticed the trend of her beginning to like someone and then shunning me out simply because ""She doesn't want to talk"" - now, I'd understand if it was a simple open&shut case like that, but whenever the person she's interested in rejects/breaks up with her, she comes crawling back to me only for it to happen again and again and again.  


I've told her each time that I don't like it, as she's virtually the only person I talk to 100% in a day when she's there, and it gives me major anxiety/leaves me hanging when she pulls this trick and she knows this.  


This has happened a grand total of 6 times over the past however long, I'm beginning to feel that this is the start of the 7th run, and I'm at my wit's end with it. My other friends have all told me the similar thing as to how I'm simply being used as backup and that they don't understand why I still talk to her (there's drama between them that I won't get into as it's very extensive and not my place to talk about it.), as I'm the only one from the group who talks to her on a friendly level

c3lt51	2019-06-22 05:30:54	Anynamewilldowjust	AITA for handling a situation poorly which resulted in an excoworker quitting	"The last shop I worked in was really shitty and went through staff like crazy because pay was crap and the only long term staff were those that couldn't get hired elsewhere.  They were also permanently short staffed so the rota was subject to change at 3 seconds notice.  John and Jake were 20 something idiots who messed around a lot, but still got a reasonable amount of work done, and there was a girl, Jess, around the same age who was autistic(?).  She was kind, but often said things that were slightly inappropriate/strange, she was also naive, but while she sometimes obsessed a little over getting one piece of work done perfectly and got easily stressed she worked hard and got more done than most of the rest.

No one liked going on till and there wasn't an official rota for it, but we generally had some understanding that someone would take you off till after a couple of hours.  John was a supervisor and often put Jess on till saying that someone would take her off in a couple of hours but would then consistently 'forget', put it off and she often spent most/all of her shift on it.  Jake would often hand till off to her claiming he was just going to the toilet and not come back or promise to come back on at 7 when his shift finished at 6.  This sort of thing happened most days and Jess was often pushed into doing the worst jobs.  Jess made several verbal complaints to the manager who was very placating and things would improve for a few days but then go back to usual.

There were also other informal rules, break priority was given to the person that had worked the longest, but some supervisors, particularly John would move Jess's break even if she'd asked first and had worked for the longest period of time uninterrupted because Jess was less likely to cause a fuss than other employees and didn't have friends/allies.

I didn't work there long, but after I left I wrote a letter that was very critical of John, Jake and the manager and pointed out that the length of time Jess spent on a standing till and the spacing of her breaks violated labour laws.  I didn't stand up for Jess when I was there at all and didn't think about how she'd cope with any fallout when a copy/word of the complaint got passed to the manager involved.  She'd worked there for 4 years and I don't think she'd perform well in interview and she's never had any other job and never really mentioned friends/life outside work.  We're Facebook friends and she made an upset post about having to quit and I feel really bad, but I'm not sure if I should have seen this coming or not."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3lqxd	2019-06-22 05:23:59	Mondashawan	WIBTA if I confront my MIL for not acknowledging my lung cancer?	"Not sure where to start. So my MIL lives across the country from me and my husband. Her and my husband's brother live together. They are both a little strange. I say that because they are both paranoid. They think that the family always wants to know what they're up to and what is going on with their lives. They think that people from their past are coming to get them. They move frequently because they think they are being spied on or people are casing their property.

Anyway over the 15 years we've been together, I thought I'd developed a good relationship with her. She is in her 70s and doesn't have much going on with her life so we don't hear from her unless there's a health scare. She calls us up to tell us about some new possible disease or health crisis. Most of the time these turn out to be nothing. When it was something a few years ago, we immediately rearranged husband's vacation to go out and see her and spend time with her because we thought she was going to die. However that did not happen.

Anyway this year I got lung cancer. I had a lung nodule that my doctor was pushing me to have removed. We did what is called a wedge resection and during the operation they have a pathologist check the tissue. Turns out it was cancerous and they removed a lobe. My husband informed his mother about this. I got nothing from her. She has not called to check up on me. She did not send any flowers or even a get well card. I feel really hurt by this. I feel this is unacceptable and I want to confront her about it. Truthfully I'm really kind of pissed off. It's kind of a big deal to get cancer. Especially because she sends us cards for every freaking holiday that there is. But somehow she couldn't manage to make the minimal effort to send me a get-well card.

Not sure if I should bother confronting her, but on the other hand I feel like it's not okay to fail to acknowledge when someone in your family had cancer and went through an operation. BTW, she was a nurse practitioner so she's not squeamish about this type of thing."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Everytime me and Kyle would have an argument, I will tell my other friends about it to make me feel better. But he would find out since one of my friends messaged him about the argument. We had a big argument today. He talks about how I'm a boring person and that I don't try to make the conversation more fun. (I'm a shy and quiet person) and how I always spread arguments with my other friends and that it's an invasion of privacy and calls me a snake for that. He also says that I'm useless and I don't know what to say when he goes through dark times. I'm not good at helping people when they are having issues in life. He also says I respect my other friends (IRL and online) more than I respect him. Also he likes to block me temporarily when we get into an argument and says I don't care when he does it.

c3lnc2	2019-06-22 05:12:48	Dcc4933	AITA for telling a stranger he had something in his teeth	"I was at a somewhat fancy restaurant and was sitting in a booth. The table in front of me had a man in his 20s, along with what appeared to be a date. I was facing the man, the girls back was to me. 

As I was eating my meal, I noticed that the man was eating a salad and got something green in his front teeth. It was large and he genuinely did not know. 

I got second hand embarrassment because the guy was hamming it up to his date and kept smiling. It was obvious they were not at a point where she could just tell him he had something there. 

When I got up to leave with my wife, I stopped and told the guy I needed to tell him something. He looked at me and said “okay, what?”  I tried to lean in to whisper so as to not embarrass him in front of his date, and he backed away and said “not too close man” and laughed. So I shrugged and said, okay, I’m not trying to be rude but you have something green in your teeth. I just thought you should know. 

The guy looked embarrassed and started trying to get it out. His date just looked on and seemed mortified. The guy just said “thanks for embarrassing me” and I told Him “well I wanted to whisper it but you wouldn’t let me, and I feel like if I was in your shoes I would want to know”

My wife had already walked to the entrance at this point and looked annoyed. The guy did not seem happy. I really was just trying to help and didn’t mean to offend. Was I an asshole for what I said?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"A year ago this guy (20M) and I (20F) were in a casual not-quite-relationship. Things were complicated and at one point he stopped talking to me, and suddenly I saw he was official with this other girl who I’d never seen before.
A  few months ago I started writing songs about it to try to process things and have my own closure. One song in particular is very obviously about him and how he left. Right as I’m getting excited about recording and playing my music live, he messages me. 
Apparently he broke up with the girl, who wouldn’t allow him to talk to me. He said he has so much to apologize for and seems like he genuinely missed me and feels really bad. We talked a little bit and agreed that we’d be friends again when I go back to his state for college. I’m so excited as he was a great guy until the shit went down, and we planned a time to facetime to really talk things out. 
The only thing I’m really stressed about is that we’re both musicians, and if all goes well with us he’ll probably be involved in the production of my EP.

The cake slices were given to me with the statement ""Happy Birthday, here's your present."" And the croissant was referred to as something my parents would share while I ate the cake.  Throughout the evening my dad kept defending the cake from my mom, saying that it's ""her cake and she can eat it"" and to ""wait for her to eat it."" 

I chose to eat the slices when my mom was in the bathroom because I didn't want her looming over me while I wanted to eat the cake. My dad was on the computer doing whatever he usually does in the evening. I made sure to leave a little (about two bites) from both slices so that my parents could taste them both, since my mom said she ""just wanted a little bit"" and my dad hadn't said anything to that effect. 

When my dad came back into the kitchen he said ""wow you're really socially inept, aren't you"" and got really upset that I didn't call them over to share the cake. My mom also made a few statements to the effect that I should have called them over, and that because we normally share the treats from the bakery this would have been the same. My dad then refused to eat the parts I did save for him, saying that if I wanted to eat all of the cake so much I might as well finish it. 

Was I wrong in assuming that the slices of cake were specifically for me to consume? I'm genuinely not sure how I managed to eat cake wrong, given that it was never specifically communicated to me that they were for all of us to share."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c3ljlb	2019-06-22 05:01:29	whitecollarpizzaman	WIBTA if I bought a bus ticket home so I can explore a few extra hours since my friends insist on leaving really early?	"So on the surface this may seem mundane, but I’ll add some context. I have three guys I’d consider best friends. One has never flown before in his life, and I’m more or less going along to “hold is hand” since he’s actually rather nervous. He connects in one city to another flight and I bought a one way ticket to that city with the intention of doing some exploring and then taking a bus home. 

Cue my other friends. My other two friends had both expressed interest in visiting an aquarium in this city, and since it’s only a few hours drive from OUR city, I suggested they meet me down there, and then we can go there, stay overnight, and then do some additional exploring. They were totally on board with it as long as were back Sunday night (yes this Sunday, I really should be asleep for my AM flight but I’m excited.) Now I work Monday too, but really don’t need to be into the office at any specific time, as long as I finish my work for the week, and log about 40 hours. My friends don’t have the luxury, but I figured around 10-11 won’t be that late to return, IE, leave the city around 6-7pm. However today they expressed they expect to be BACK at 6 or 7, meaning leaving by 2, IMO that’s too early and kills a lot of exploring time in a city that I probably won’t go out of my way to visit again soon. 

Here’s where my inquiry lies: since they’re making the effort to come down and help me get back, would I be an asshole if I told them I’d rather stay later, and buy a Greyhound ticket back home? My justification is that by going to this aquarium, and by getting a hotel room, I’m actually spending MORE than I would have even if I got a round trip flight, so it wouldn’t be that dickish to just go back on my own accord anyways, but on the other hand, they did come down this weekend largely because I asked them to, likely they’d have gone another weekend if it wasn’t for this unique situation."

We've been dating for over three years and he still hasn't come out or told literally anyone he knew we were dating. For three years it's been romance behind locked doors or in other towns, and if we're in public he very consciously acts only friendly to me. But he had no problem telling his family I'm gay, and it honestly felt like a fucking test run or something just the way he was like *gay dude, whattaya think?* Even weirder, the test run was successful and he still didn't come out. They like me, have no problem with me, and I've never felt uncomfortable or unsafe with this family. A bunch of open-minded liberals, and he's worried about coming out?

After three years I started to suspect it was more about hiding our relationship than his sexuality, which really messes with my head because I've done that kind of relationship before and it really hurts in the end when it turns out they don't love you the way you love them. I mean, it's three years-if he doesn't love me, what are we even doing? So for his birthday I got him some pride shit-a flag for his room, a shirt, stuff like that. I signed the present *your boyfriend xoxo* and I want to give it to him next week during the party.

My cousins and I found this funny; adults did not. A few hours later, after dropping everyone off, my mom told me the comment was uncalled for and I had embarrassed her. Which was the point.

c3ldsg	2019-06-22 04:43:51		AITA for cutting off my friend completely from my life because he cheated on his SO?	"I was cheated on a few years ago by my 5-year SO.  I became depressed, anxious, and my self-esteem dropped. I won't go out, I don't want to meet with friends, I just want to be alone. My work performance plummeted and I distanced myself from my family. One friend was there for me during those dark days. I would call him mid cry just to vent out any negative feelings I have. We would go out to eat when I would stay at home and not eat for long periods of time.

My friend and I share the same views on cheating; that if you have problems in your relationship, you either fix it for real, or break up if you can't; cheating isn't an option. 

Every time I hear/watch anything about cheating, it still brings back those feelings from years ago. Kinda like PTSD, but for cheating. I can't completely shake off the feeling that any future partner would cheat on me. I was still hopeful though, seeing as my friend has been with his SO for years. 

Now, my friend who helped me back then, cheated on his SO. The relationship became cold. He wasn't abused in the relationship, nor was his SO. It's just that the honeymoon phase was over and the relationship just fell flat. He used a hookup app to look for someone to have sex with just to feel some excitement. He said he wanted to break up and was just waiting for the right timing. 

 I don't think I want to associate myself with him anymore because I still feel very uneasy and anxious when I hear people cheat. I don't think it's great for my mental and emotional health to be friends with someone who cheated. I completely ghosted my friend. Cold turkey. He keeps texting me, so I blocked him. 

My other friends now know and say that's too much and I was being an A-hole. They say sometimes people cheat because they can't take the problems in the relationship any more. I tell them, why don't they just break up; To which they respond ""It's not that easy.""

c3lda4	2019-06-22 04:42:15	Mcaines39	AITA for distancing myself from a girl with special needs?	"Before you crucify me: hear me out. 

-won't be using real names for obvious reasons:

Flashback to a few months ago. I usually am one of the last people to make it to lunch, and every day there is a table of kids with special needs that says hi to me, be cause they know me personally. Of course I say hi to them back, but one day this girl Jessica from the table starts to speak with me in the lunch line. And I keep a conversation and go about my day, not thinking anything of it. 

But after a while, I  noticed that Jessica would consistently wait for me in the lunch line by the time I make it to the cafeteria. Sometimes I saw that she was looking for me, because she would begin making her way to the line when she saw me. I think she may have had a crush on me. I thought it was weird, since we didn't really know each other at all, but kinda sweet. So I keep talking to her. But she doesn't stop waiting on me, and it got to the point she would get in trouble for it (the special needs kids get priority in line at my shcool and usually get food first- shouldn't be anywhere near the back). When that happened, I explained to her that she doesn't have to wait in line for me, and that I see her as a friend. 

But I don't think that she got the message, because she would still try to wait in line for me. At this point, I decided to speak to her teacher in private later in the day to explain thaf I've told Jessica that I don't want her waiting for me and that we aren't going to be more than friends. The teacher thanked me for coming to her and would explain it to Jessica. 

From that point on: Jessica always gave me a dirty look whenever she saw me. Foward to today: I was at my job (grocery bagger) and Jessica comes into my line. Her look said it all: she was still VERY upset with me. We didn't exchange any words, and she left, she just said ""bye"" and looked on the verge of tears. When my coworker looked at me confused, I explained the story to her. Afterwards, she said I could have handled it better, and thst I was cruel for breaking her heart.

The recently-hired manager Dee is pleasant enough, but she's a (totally platonic) toucher.  I'm sure nothing was intended by it; she's just one of those tactile friendly people.  I get that some people do that, some hug everybody, but that's not me.

  
Arm, shoulder...I put up with it for the first couple of months even though it bothered me from day one.  I don't go putting my hands on the staff, and it doesn't seem out of line to expect the same courtesy in return.  

&#x200B;

As time went by, I felt like the awkwardness would be even higher if I said anything to Dee.  How do you tell someone, ""you're great, you do a super job here, but please stop touching me"" and not give offense?  I know the owner but didn't want to get Dee in trouble over my discomfort.

&#x200B;

I was just at the bar for trivia night and felt a hand on the small of my back.  I was startled.  I turned and Dee said hi.  I returned the hi and quietly said, ""it really startles me when people do that.""  She immediately removed her hand and apologized.  The locs of the gentleman sitting next to me caught her eye, and she touched one and examined it without so much as a greeting to the guy.  I'd expect to catch hands for that, but I guess he didn't notice.

c3lbwj	2019-06-22 04:38:03	kellykins17	AITA for not recording my sister's wedding?	"Love this sub, long time lurker and I (F28) FINALLY have something to post where I'm looking to have internet strangers weigh in on my life.

Backstory: My sister/only sibling Diana (F26, fake name) got married to the love of her life back in October. Although they hired a professional photographer, they neglected to hire a videographer for the ceremony. While Diana is getting her hair done, she asks me to record the ceremony on my phone. I told her, ""I don't have enough space on my phone"" because I had no idea how long the ceremony would take place. She came up with the solution that I would sit up front and use her phone to record everything. I agreed to this.

As the wedding began, I sat at the front row (they didn't have a wedding party as to avoid hurt feelings, which was fine by me). It was there that I realized that Diana never gave me her phone. Shit. At this point, I figured what's done is done. The wedding was never recorded by me. I still have no idea if anyone else recorded the wedding, but I would assume not.

After the reception as we were driving home in separate cars, Diana texts me to ask for the wedding video. I am NOT going to ruin her wedding night by telling her there is no video, so I told her the file was too big to send. She went on her honeymoon the next morning and was a happy bride.

Present day: 8 months later (aka tonight), Diana calls me up asking for the video because she wants to do something with it for their 1 year anniversary. This is the first time she's brought it up since her wedding. I told her I never recorded it because she never gave me her phone. Then I reminded her of the conversation we had while she was getting her hair done. She was quiet for a moment then said that she had to go.

My side: Things were so hectic because of last minute wedding things that I literally forgot about recording it until it was too late to do anything about it. I don't think IATA for not recording it since Diana never gave me her phone, so there was no option for me to do so. Considering the wedding was back in October, I don't remember how much space I had, but I know it was less than 6 minutes of recording time. This ended up being right under half of the ceremony time. I genuinely feel bad about not getting the ceremony recorded.

Diana's side (I'm assuming; she hasn't called me an Asshole yet, but based off of past experience this can blow up pretty huge): I said I would record it, and I didn't. I should have gotten the phone from her to record it because I agreed to do so. If I didn't have her phone, I should have found another phone to record the ceremony.

c3lbq2	2019-06-22 04:37:31		AITA for not cooperating with the subletting process with my roommate who is moving out?	"My roommate of 3 years just moved out 2 days ago since he's starting his medical residency on the other side of the country. Our lease is up Oct 31st so the plan was for him to sublet his room for the remainder of the lease. A few weeks ago, he told me he was going to sublet the room to a friend of his from med school, and I said that was fine. About a week and a half ago, he got the sublease forms from the landlord and my landlord contacted me to make sure I approved of the person subleasing. Only then did I learn that not only his friend was moving in, but apparently his friend has a fiancee that was also moving in. I'm not open to having 2 people move into the place, so I immediately told my landlord that I did not approve and informed my roommate as well. I asked him why he didn't mention there would be two people, and he didn't really offer an explanation other than he didn't think it would be a big deal. It's pretty obvious he was trying to sneak that by me and didn't realize the landlord was going to ask me for approval. So, I told him that he'd need to find someone new to sublease.

He moved out on Wednesday and today he emailed me that he found a few different people who are interested in seeing the room so they can sublet it for the remaining 4 months, and he asked me if I could show them the place this weekend. I told him no, that I'm not spending my time showing the room to potential subletters after what he tried to pull. If he wants to sublet the room, he'll need to fly back here and do that himself--which is unrealistic since he'll be working 6 days a week for his residency. And if he can't sublet the room, he's on the hook for 4 months of rent which is $1500/mo.

I explained to him that had he been upfront with me from the beginning, I could've told him no to 2 people moving in weeks ago and he'd have had time to find a subletter before he moved. And if he didn't find one in that time, I would've been more than happy to help. But after he tried to deceive me and a pull a fast one me, I have no interest in taking care of this for him. Either he finds the time to fly back and show the place himself, or he can eat the cost of 4 months of rent.

Of course, he's mad and is accusing me of being an asshole. Am I the asshole here?"		1	0

He fishes for compliments (“Isn’t it nice that I got the pasta prepped for today?”), acts like he’s the only person who stays late even though there’s other people who do the same (“I stayed here until 3 AM doing these dishes.”), states the obvious like we’re all stupid (“Can you make some sauce? Without sauce, we can’t make pizzas.”), and he even blackmails me sometimes to do stuff he’s been assigned because he’s figured out that I’m too nice for my own good (“If you don’t help me with this, I’m going to get fired and I won’t work here anymore. You don’t want me to get fired, do you?”).

Yesterday, I finally snapped and broke down because of his constant shit and was pulled aside by the managers. They told that even though he’s been working here longer than most people, it doesn’t mean he’s a good worker in general.

Fast forward to tonight. My co-worker wanted me to help him make sauce since we were running out and it was a Friday/our busiest day. It’s around 45 minutes before my shift is over and the entire kitchen was packed. Our kitchen is relatively small, so the basic amount for us to have in there working is 6 people. Including me, we had around 8 people in there. 

After helping my co-worker a bit, I could barely make my way to and from stations. So, I asked one of my managers if it was okay for me to go 30 minutes early. This made my co-worker completely pissed off.

I had been following what my managers had told me and taking his ‘advice’ for a grain of salt while not letting him boss me around, but I honestly feel really guilty for leaving him to finish the sauce, which can be pretty time consuming. It’s his job originally though and I was in charge of sides. Plus, he had really gotten on my nerves the entire time. If I had to hear one more overly condescending comment from him, I’d pop a vein so hard that a calzone would explode.

I've been quite preoccupied with studying for a college placement test because I'm trying to place high enough so that I won't have to pay for certain classes. I get stressed out with tests and I feel like I need to study as much as I can, and I need to score higher than average to get where I want to be placed. I recently came back from a family vacation and I had 4 days to prepare for the test.

So her 21st birthday arrives and she has plans for us and her friends to go to a beach 2 hours away, for the whole day. I asked her if I had to go, because I would rather stay and study. She gets extremely defensive and tells me how selfish I sound for not taking just 1 day out of my week to spend it with her. Even though I see her every day. I asked my mom and sisters if I'm crazy here and they agreed with my girlfriend. Of course I wanted to go with her, but I'm already on a tight budget as it is, so to save that much by not having to take 2 extra math classes, means a lot.

We’ve grown extremely close really quickly, and I have a feeling this is going to be a very long term relationship. She’s on the same page. We have very different backgrounds. We’re both university students, she works a lot and pays for all of her stuff. My parents are fully supporting me. 

Originally she was really apprehensive to tell me about this because “other people in your situation usually judge me pretty badly”. My view is she’s much more impressive than me, I’m not sure where I’d be if I was on my own like she is. 

Now from the beginning we agreed to split paying for everything, and we have been so far. I feel really guilty though. Every time she talks about paying bills, working more to pay for a class, or anything of the sort I feel horrible. 

Now my issue is I’d like to offer to cover everything because of how fortunate I am. Yet at the same time I’m fairly certain she’d feel guilty, and I’m not sure if she’d be offended.

So I open the can of tuna, add some mayo, and I tell her to come over and add how much salt and pepper she liked.   She said: “I’m sure it’s fine.” So added a bit of salt and pepper, shrugged and brought it over to her.

Later, good naturedly,  she said she thought I was a bit of a jerk for asking a guest to season their own food... I laughed the comment off with a shrug.

c3l68k	2019-06-22 04:20:28	throwawaycatattacks	AITA for being angry about being given a portrait of my fiance's cat?	"This past week my fiancé's mom came over with a portrait for us that she'd done of my fiancé's old cat. Except his ""old cat"" isn't dead or anything..he's with his ex girlfriend, Jasmine, and has been for the past four years.

&#x200B;

My fiancé and Jasmine got the cat after six months of dating & living together without ever making it clear who the cat belonged to. He broke up with her after maybe a year of dating and had ""custody"" of the cat, until his Jasmine's dad called my now-fiancé up saying that Jasmine was very depressed and could he please share the cat with her.

&#x200B;

This meant that every couple of months he would put the cat in a kennel and drive him over to her place, where she'd keep him for a couple of months. The cat absolutely HATED this and would get super stressed out; vomiting and hiding the first few days after these ""transfers"" happened.

&#x200B;

I met my fiancé probably about a year after he and Jasmine broke up. Jasmine was NOT happy about us getting together and tried several times to get my fiancé to cheat on me, bullied me on social media, and trash talked me to their mutual friends for about a year. He fought all of this but still kept on sharing the cat.

&#x200B;

After a year and a half of this I said that I wasn't going to force him to give up his pet or anything, but that I was breaking up with him because I couldn't handle this back-and-forth with no end in sight. Two days after I broke up with him, he told me he had given Jasmine the cat. When I asked why he didn't just keep him, he said it was because I was really allergic to him. I felt pretty terrible but I at least knew that Jasmine would take good care of him. We got back together and that was pretty much that.

&#x200B;

Back to my fiancé's mom. When my fiancé was growing up, she frequently got rid of his pets. She also *hated* this cat. Like, wanting to get rid of him every time she came over, complaining about his fur etc. And she hated Jasmine to the point of freaking out at her for not finishing small amounts of food. I can't figure out why his mom did this portrait-my fiancé thought she was doing it as a nice gesture, but she knew how sad he was after giving the cat away. I feel really terrible having to see it because it's like a constant reminder of not only my fiancé giving up the cat, but all the fights we had and Jasmine's shitty behaviour.

Last year my ex of 12 years died decades too young. I’m happily married with kids but took my time to grieve and my spouse was very supportive during this time. Since then I don’t bring ex up even though I think of ex often and deal with my sadness internally. 

My neighbor who also lost a close friend, told me the other day that she had an experience visiting a psychic medium and was able to speak to her friend. She gave several examples of proof that it was not a scam. It’s hard for me to really know. Neighbor seems to have her head on straight. I neither believe nor disbelieve her story. It’s so hard to know what the truth is. 

I reached out to the psychic, who takes appts 6 months in advance and charges a few hundred dollars. My spouse and I have joint finances but also have cash that we earn and can spend as we wish. I made an appt and will pay in cash. 

I feel my spouse would disapprove because I grieved long enough and I should have moved on by now. But I also have unfinished business and lingering things I want to say to my ex if I knew they could really hear me. I’m not in love with ex, I don’t have lingering romantic feelings. Part of my sadness lies in the fact that I feel badly for having moved on and cut them out of my life. There are just things I want to communicate and apologize for and things I want to know. My goal is to put this behind me once I’m done. 

AITA for secretly seeing a psychic medium behind my spouse’s back in order to communicate with my ex who died?

ETA: thanks everyone.

I hate that it did that. If I have something I need to say to the ex, I have to believe that it can be heard right from where I am. I want to move forward.

I'll provide as much details I can in the most objective way I can but please bear in mind English is not my mother tongue.

I'm from a small town in a country in Europe. I've never had a friend or acquaintance that wasn't caucasian growing up because I had never met one. My country is small and even when I moved to the capital to study, there just were too little foreign people. 

I had friends online but this particular topic of afro hair never came up. 

I took a semester abroad in a country where the population is far more mixed. This moment happens a few weeks into living there where I'm at a little get together with some girls from my uni. It came to that point in the discussion where one of the girls (who was black) who we will call J, was explaining that she was tired of ""straightening"" her hair continuously and damaging it so bad. 

I asked her how she was damaging it so much because striaghteners shouldn't burn that bad and she started telling me about the whole process of how she transforms her natural hair. Like a dumbass, I said something like ""Oh! I didn't know your hair was naturally curly, I thought it was straight!"" (I had only ever seen her with a straight hair and at this point I did not know all black people had afro hair) She just shot me this half smile look probably wandering if I was genuinely stupid or insulting her. 

However before she could reply this other girl in our little group started hissing at me how disrespectful I was, didn't I know better, that all black girls have hair like that etc. I'm sure you can imagine the scene. At this point I figure it out and I'm just very embarrassed and apologising profusely wanting the ground to swallow me whole. J was very nice and told me it's ok no harm done but at this point a few of the other girls came to chastise me as well and then I just left after apologising to J one last time. 

I never talked to any of them again but I still think about that moment. Was ITA and even worse was I racist?

My boyfriend (43M) and I live together. 

Him and his exwife have 2 kids together. They both try having a good relationship for the sake of their kids, which they share custody of. The problem that I have with their ""good"" relationship is that most of it is him being controlled by her. 

For example, last week she texted him saying he needed to go take their kids to feed her sisters dog, as she was gone for the day. He gets visibly upset when she sends messages, and that sets a tone for our day. I decided that enough was enough. I sent her a message telling her how upset he was that she constantly had him running errands that had nothing to do with their kids, and that the only reason they still had any type of communication was because of their children. She flew off the handle.

He got a call from her, and of course she was raging again. 

She since sent me a text saying that their relationship does not involve me in any way. That I need to be mindful if we all want to be a part of their kids lives (we all as in me? Him?) She said she doesn't need this petty bullshit. 

About 10 months previously, she told him that if we ever had kids together, she would cut his dick off. I've never spoken to her of this, but feel like that is in no way any of her business. 

My boyfriend says we need to work it out among ourselves, which I think is ridiculous. In my opinion, he's very much involved too. I have tried messaging her, but she blocked my number after sending her message. 

I love the kids.  I don't want them to suffer at any cost because of our disagreements.

He just got married, and I was with him step to step in assisting with his wardrobe as well as he trusts my fashion sense (to which he looked awesome and was ecstatic with all my help).

Day of wedding though, I was assigned to a table that was all the way in the shadow realm of a corner, where you couldn’t even see the groom and bride nor anyone speaking for speeches; would need to stand and walk over to see it all. No biggie, and not like you couldn’t see our table if you walked near it, but he and the bride didn’t even table touch our group.

c3l1wq	2019-06-22 04:07:34		AITA for not wanting to give up my room for relatives	"TLDR AT THE BOTTOM

So I (17M) have relatives (aunt and uncle) from my dad's side that we are not really particularly close to (we see them like 3 times a year), that live about a 2 hour drive away but like to come down to our city every weekend to hang out with friends, etc. 

More recently, since they have been coming down every weekend, they ALWAYS ask to stay over for the night at our home. This meant that either my sister (13 M) or I had to give up our room for our relatives to stay in. My sister and I alternate who gives up their room every time they come down. The first couple of times I didn't mind, but now that's it's becoming basically systematic, I'm pissed. It's getting really annoying because every time they stay over, the next day we have to clean up to sheets they slept in, and they always come in the middle of the night so one of us has to be awake to let them in. 

Because here's the thing: everytime they ask to stay the night, they KNOW that either my sister or I have to give our room to them, and we don't necessarily live in a big house either. They could easily ask to stay at any other relative's house with extra space, but they ALWAYS choose our home. 

So, I told my dad they can just sleep on the couches in the living room, but he keeps treating them like royalty and insisting they have to have a room. I asked him why do we always have to give our rooms up and then clean after them in which he replies with calling me selfish. 

Am I the asshole here???

TLDR; Relatives I dunno very well keep coming over to stay the night and that means either my sister and I have to give up our room. I think it's annoying and suggested to my dad that they should just sleep on the couch. He thinks this is selfish."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c3l1ok	2019-06-22 04:06:52		WIBTA for being upset that my boyfriend is letting our anniversary take the backseat here?	"Monday the 24th will be our 1 year anniversary and these past twelve months have been the best of my life. We made plans a couple weeks ago to drive out to a nearby state park to hike around and have a picnic. 

We got lucky that we both have this Monday off work. We both work full time and we live busy lives and only get to see each other once a week (on Tuesdays). Maybe every two weeks if things don't line up. This Tuesday, however, I'm going to my grandmother's house to help her build raised garden beds and fill them with soil, so we'd have to wait til next Tuesday if we rescheduled. I've been looking forward to our anniversary since we made the plans. 

He just texted me a couple minutes ago and invited me to dinner with his family. On the 24th. We hardly get to see each other, but he gets to see his family even less. Maybe once or twice a month even though they live a couple minutes from where he works. (He works a night shift until 3-4 am and then sleeps until noon)

WIBTA or would I be considered immature for being upset about this? I know he hardly gets to see his family, and I'm always super happy when he gets to spend time with them, but we've been planning this picnic for a while now."	Not enough info	1	0
c3l0ch	2019-06-22 04:02:53		WIBTA Trying to ruin my friends potential with his crush	"So today has been an adventure it begins with my friend H telling me that one of my friends (K) has a scrapbook of his crush. After hearing this I tell a couple close friends seeing what they think before reacting. 
      
       Now after this a text from K comes into our group chat saying how terrible I am for spreading rumors about him. I obviously got mad since I don’t feel like I did this and he said it in the group chat not to my face. Minutes after I get a text from K saying that he has hated me since a week after we met (it’s been 2 years) and he told H to tell the shrine thing to me so I wouldn’t want to hang with him anymore. I am obvious mad so text back mad and confused he then goes on and insults everything about me. He then insults me and my friend who is on my side specifically. We have been going at each other for about an hour and I really want to make him mad. 

       Now B dated his crush freshman year (before I knew him) and we are now going into our senior year and the whole time I’ve known him he has been obsessed with his crush to a point where it’s creepy he even says he loves her and probably will forever no matter how she feels. 

Would I be the asshole to show B’s crush the texts saying how much she loves him even though she doesn’t have feeling for him and tell her how creepily and often he mentions her."		1	0

c3l009	2019-06-22 04:01:55		AITA for talking about my close friend in a group chat?	Me and My friend have been friends for 2.5 years and I’ve been pretty close. She’s through some really hard times with me as well as I’ve been there for her. She recently found a boyfriend in her life (that’s fine) and we still hanged out. However when we started hanging out she want to less than she normally did. A lot less. When we did hang out she would just go on her phone texting her boyfriend pretty much the whole time and saying “what’s up” and nothing else every 5 mins. A lot of the time I asked to hang out she said she’s working but my boyfriend works she goes there a lot with her bf and my boyfriend brought to my attention that he’s seen her there lots when she claims she’s “working” I was really sad and I asked in group chat full of girls similar ages that my close friend is becoming more and more distant and I think she’s lying about her hours. I did NOT mention who I was talking about but a few hours later she texts me losing her shit saying she wasn’t lying about her hours and she needed the hours to pay her bills and I don’t have to pay for anything (which I do) AITA?		1	0
c3kzlo	2019-06-22 04:00:54	throwaway9748282	WIBTA if I didn’t pay my ex girlfriend back for a plane ticket?	"My ex and I were long distance, and she booked a flight for me to see her. It was $600 round trip.  She said she’d pay for $200 of it. We got into a fight, and now we’re breaking up. The breakup started because she was trying to control how I spend my money, calling me an idiot for betting $50 on sports online. She expects me to pay her $600 for it. I don’t know if I’ll get credit for canceling yet because I haven’t seen the ticket and I don’t know which airline it is. I feel like it’s unfair for me to pay her $600 for it. I told her I didn’t want to take the flight she chose as it leaves at midnight and lands at 6 am and I’d have to go to work right after. Would I be an asshole if I didn’t send her $600 for the flight?

Edit: I am okay with sending $400. She wants the $600"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c3kzbg	2019-06-22 04:00:06		AITA for texting plans to do a favor for my ex two days before, but not sending a reminder text?	"My ex and I dated for 7 years starting in high school. He screwed up royally and ruined the relationship, but I still support him because I care for him and his family is not that reliable. 

A few days ago he messaged me that he was staying at a friend's place for a few days until his new lease starts and asking to borrow a bed. I offered to bring him a blow up bed when I would be driving through town the next weekend (this was after some back and forth logistics and hmmming and hwwing) I hadn't been talking to him on the phone because I was visiting my parents and they wouldn't be thrilled that I still talk to him. But the real texts in question are as follows (exact texts with personal details redacted).

Wednesday

Me: I can bring it Friday early morning as I drive through town. I was just sad/worried thinking you were sleeping on the floor until then.

Me:Sorry I haven't really been able to take calls

Him: it's okay

Me: I'll see you Friday morning then :)

Thursday

Me: What address are you staying at?

Him: gives street number and name

At 12:30 am he texted ""Any chance you have 2?""

When I woke up at 5:30 am I said ""No, sorry""

Then I packed the car and headed on my weekend trip which I would drive past his place.

I get there at about 7:30 am and find it is an apt complex which he did not give the suite number for. I called his phone 8 times and waited 15 minutes. I left no voicemail and sent these two texts. ""You didn't give me an apartment number... And your asleep ... Really?!"" And ""I don't know how long you expected me to wait, but I have things to do. I left it next to your car. Please go out and get it as soon as you wake up. Not happy""

He called about 30 minutes later and acted like I was insane for being annoyed that he didn't make it more of a priority to facilitate me doing this favor for him. I didn't swear at him or yell, but he thinks I overreacted. He thinks I didn't communicate the plan well enough for him to responsible for not being able to get it from me this morning. AITA?"		1	0
