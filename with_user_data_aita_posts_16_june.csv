c1izzt	2019-06-17 03:58:34	CheatedandPettym	AITA for ruining a girl’s relationship when I don’t know the guy?	"About two-three weeks ago I was swiping through tinder when I got a superlike. I read her bio (because who uses superlikes?) and it said something along the lines of:

“I’m taken. Looking for something discrete and NSA.”

Given that bio and the fact none of her pics had her face showing, I naturally assumed her boyfriend had no idea she is cheating on him. I’ve been cheated on in the past so this really irked me more than it should have. 

I liked her back with the sole intention of letting her boyfriend know what she was doing. We hooked up a few times before I finally found out who she was dating by Facebook stalking her. 

Basically sent the guy a long message explaining the situation along with screenshots of all her texts. Girl in question textbombs me calling me every name in the book. 

I told my friend this tonight and she was honestly disgusted by my actions. Really surprised me, but I guess maybe my judgement is skewed because of being cheated on in the past. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1iwan	2019-06-17 03:46:47	amsage3	AITA for not sleeping in the basement during a tornado warning?	"Last night when I came to bed my wife was up, frenetically  getting dressed and gathering up some blankets, pillows and stuff.  She told me we were under a tornado warning and that I needed to gather our three year old daughter up and bring her down to the basement.  Around this time, the tornado sirens started blaring.

My wife is  extremely sensitive to storms.  She gets very worried and anxious, and has confided in me that she loses sleep during nighttime storms, worrying about all kinds of disaster scenarios.  I don't shame her for these feelings, but I generally don't pander or validate them.

I got our daughter down to the basement without waking her up and we started looking at the storm tracker.  The tornado warning was in effect from 11 to 11:30.  It was now 11:15,  and the sirens had stopped.  Our house was *barely* within the confines of the warning, and it didn't seem like we were in that much danger; just caution.  Our basement has a loveseat and couch.  My wife was on the couch with our son, my daughter was on the loveseat and I made a decision; I wasn't going to be able to sleep on the floor, and headed back upstairs.

My  wife didn't seem to object to my decision.  As I kissed her goodnight, I made a joke to try and lighten the mood.  I said ""if I get blown away and you find my body, remember I want to be cremated.""

This morning, there were seemingly no repercussions.  We had plans for father's day with my mom and dad, and headed  over to their house.  Not long after getting there and my mom, out of nowhere, goes ""so you wanna be  cremated, huh?""  The comment clicked immediately, and I knew I was in trouble.  All three of them started telling me how irresponsible, selfish and insensitive I was.  My wife couldn't believe I'd leave her to try and sleep alone in the basement with fears of me blowing away in a tornado  racing through her mind.  They couldn't believe I'd risk  leaving my children fatherless just to avoid sleeping on the floor.  My dad, who I recently started working with, couldn't believe that I'd risk this new venture we've started.

At this point, I'll point out that our area was recently ravaged by an F4 tornado.  It was awful, and a lot of the damage is visible right off a highway, so we're all driving by it frequently.  It's fresh in our minds and I will admit it's chilling to observe.

In any case, the argument that ensued was drawn out and ugly.  Of course I got accused of ""ruining"" father's day.  At this moment I still don't feel like IATA, but I still might be being overly defensive, which I have a tendency to be.  AITA?"	Asshole	0	0	1883.0	484.0	0.0	0.0
c1ivjx	2019-06-17 03:44:28	Alsfsewervsv	AITA for taking my fiancé's side even though I thought he was wrong?	" A little background, my fiancé's brother (we'll call him Eric) was my best friend in college, and still continues to be my best friend. He set my actually set my fiancé and I up. A month ago he broke up with his long term girlfriend and told my fiancé and I that he is gay. Well my MIL was throwing a barbecue for Father's Day Today, and Eric wanted to bring his new boyfriend.  My fiancé told him not to because he hasn't come out yet, and he thought it would be better to come out and then bring the boyfriend around. Eric got really upset and said he was going to bring his new boyfriend anyways. I honestly did not see a problem with this. My MIL and FIL love their children unconditionally, and I thought it might be a little awkward but if everyone would have an SO there, I thought Eric should have his boyfriend too. I didn't tell my Fiancé this. We went to the barbecue today and sure enough Eric brought his boyfriend. My fiancé told Eric not to introduce his boyfriend as his boyfriend at this party and just as a friend. They got into an argument and Eric left with his boyfriend and nearly crying. I've felt really bad, and when we were leaving I told my fiancé to let Eric just be himself. He explained that he was telling this to Eric for his protection and that his mother can be homophobic and he was trying to protect Eric from that.

I think it’s a making a mountain out of a mole hill situation. Other people usually leave their k cups in their too and I just throw them out before I put mine in without a second thought.

Update: I am sorry for not stating this first but I really just forgot, the K cups are scorching hot right after being used and do cool down after the initial cup brewing.

I was arguing with my mother over a topic that wasn't dreadfully important and as we were arguing she would keep interrupting me mid justification to the point I was making.

I've had a problem with being interrupted in arguments because it makes me think that the other person isn't actually listening to what it is you are saying, which is frustrating when you are genuinely listening to the other person's points.

Anyways, she was interrupting me and I said something of ""You keep on interrupting me. Stop interrupting me so I can finish my thoughts."" 

Anyways, she got kinda heated at that and begrudgingly let me finish my thoughts on the matter. But I could tell she was heated about it. 

Later, I asked her if she was mad at me and she said that she felt like I had been condescending to her by telling her to stop interrupting me. I apologized that I made her feel that way and said that it certainly wasn't my intention . She said that in arguments that the way to do it is as soon as you disagree with something you interrupt at that point because she won't remember everything she disagrees with. I said that you let the person finish their thought and then rebut.

So was I being a dickwad for telling my mother to stop interrupting me? I just would like to know if I'm the one being off base here.

c1it71	2019-06-17 03:36:36		AITA for being mad at my siblings for not telling me about our sperm donor father and going out to meet him without me every few months?	"Hey you guys I’m on mobile so if there are obvious typos or grammar mistakes. 

So recently I found out that my mom used a sperm donor, and that my sister has been in contact with him for the past year.

 I found out when my mom decided to tell me on the way to my cousins baby shower after talking about absent fathers (lmao). Anyways I turned 22 this month and she felt that she was “finally ready to tell me and my twin sister” and not to tell my younger brother, who’s 2 years younger than me. But when I asked my sister if she was told, she said that she knew since she was 18 and that she told my younger brother and my cousins a year ago. She didn’t tell me because we had been in a very long fight about her long term  (manipulative and gaslighting) boyfriend for so long that she didn’t want to talk about something so “heavy”. Then she claimed that she didn’t want to tell me because I might contact our “ biological father”. 

- The sperm donor’s sister contacted her a year ago wondering how she was related to us and got my sister in contact with the sperm donor and she and my little brother have been meeting up every few months to catch up so I guess it’s okay when my sister contacts him :-/

-She then explained that she told my cousins and younger brother at different times to keep it a secret from each other.

-My mom knows that my sister meets with the sperm donor every few months but doesn’t know that literally the whole family knows about the sperm donor.

Would I be the the asshole for asking my mom why I was left out on meeting my biological father. I also feel like I should explain to her that my sister has told everyone already."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1isla	2019-06-17 03:34:38	nyyoh	AITA for not telling a friend her husband was having an affair with her best friend?	"Background: I've been friends with the husband for 8 or 9 years (and had a friends with benefits situation for awhile before he met his wife) and met his wife through him about 5 years ago. But we worked together after that and I was a bridesmaid in their wedding. We aren't really close and I'm definitely more his friend that hers. 
The two of them have a 3 year old little girl they're going to be sharing custody of. They separated but were living together until recently. I teach an exercise class that her husband goes to sometimes and her best friend started coming too. I found out because of the class, awhile ago before they decided to divorce/move out, that they were dating and I didn't tell the wife. I never covered for them although I did tell her they had class once when she asked (which was true). She found out about them after she moved out and then found out a month later that I had known. 
She's still trying to be friends with them from what I understand but told her husband I should lose her number and never talk to her again. Before she found out I had reached out to her and told her to keep in touch and that she wasn't losing me in the divorce.
I can understand her being upset with me for not telling her but I didn't feel like it was my business. Plus, I am closer with him and I didn't want to hurt her. But she's acting like I did was worse than her husband and best friend.
Aita for not telling her what I knew?

Edit to try to clarify relationships/timeline:

Let's call husband and wife Bob and Amy and Amy's best friend Lisa.
I've known Bob for 8ish years.
He met Amy and thus I met Amy 5ish years ago.
Bob and I are better friends than Amy and I, but we're close enough I was a bridesmaid in their wedding. 
Bob and Amy separated but agreed not to date. Bob and Lisa started having an affair.
I found out. 
Bob and Amy decided they were going to get divorced and she moved out.
Then she found out about the ongoing affair and that I knew.
Lisa and Bob are moving in together and will have Amy/Bob's daughter half the time. 
Amy is still trying to be friends with them (I'm assuming for her daughter's sake) but is pissed I didn't tell her about the affair."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I've been messing around with my female friends but they know its nothing more then sex.
Now I'm more out and about in the world and while I am open to dating, that's just it. 
I'm open to dating. Not long term commitment,  not a full blown relationship. 
Just small dates like going to concerts, movies, chilling on the weekends and slowly go from there if I like her.

My friend introduced me to this girl who was a friend of his girlfriend.
 immediately I felt attracted to and i can tell she immediately liked me back once we started talking.
She told me about her exes and how bad her last relationship was and I felt a little turnt off. 
Not because she's a bad person or anything.
From how she was talking to me i can tell if anything happened between us, she's looking for a serious relationship and I'm not.
I figured I'd make my intentions known now and I told her I'm not really looking for a girlfriend. I honestly just want someone I can chill with, establish a friendship and maybe sex if she's interested and if I like her we'll go from there and she seemed like she was ok with that and asked me if I wanted to see a movie to which I agreed.
Fast forward. 
We been hanging out for two weeks when she texted me on last week how did I feel about her.
I knew what she meant and although I liked her, I  wasn't interested in dating so I friendzoned her.
I responded honestly 
""I think you're a great person, and I wish I could offer you more but, im just not ready for a serious relationship which I believe you want. Unfortunately, I can't give that to you. I would still like to be friends but if not I understand and will respect your choice"".
She wrote back asking if she did something wrong and I told her
""No, its not you. Im just not ready for commitment right now"".
She then tells me she'll wait for me and that she wants a relationship with me and she'll wait as long as she has too. 
I asked her not to wait for me and she ignored me basically. 
So she's been texting me and I haven't responded to any of them.
I don't want her waiting for me.
I want her to forget about me entirely.
My friends girlfriend called me tonight to say I was a dick for ghosting her friend who apparently has been crying to her about it but I made it clear that I didn't want her around waiting for me or anything like that.

I'm sure you all know today is Father's Day. I went to my dad's house with my mom (they are not together) because he told her he had a puppy to give in adoption and to come to pick it up.

So far so good right? Well when we got there the puppy had ""dissapeared"". According to my parents, my ""aunt"" saw the post in facebook about the dog in adoption and she stole it from my dad and give it to the owners (we didnt know it had owners already). My mum was afraid of asking her, my dad didnt say anything, so i stepped in and asked her. She said she didnt know anything about it (but she knew who the owners were and the puppy couldnt have escaped just by himself). Well i didnt say anything more at that point, until when we were a little far away she started telling (kinda screaming) my mum that ""she had already a lot of pets and that she didnt need more"" Yes, we have lots of pets but she doesnt have anything to do with it.

c1iol2	2019-06-17 03:22:20	bigstone22	AITA 8 minute countdown	"Here is the back story:

There is this girl I work with let’s call her Ashley. Ashley and I had a bit of a fling in my early months on the job. 

A lot of the time we spent together she would do nothing but gossip about other employees behind their backs. In the office she would be smiling and laughing with the same people.

I had a feeling she was talking about me behind my back. I heard a lot of rumors circulating about myself that were half truths. A half truth is always a lie. 

One day one of my co workers let me know that Ashley was saying things behind my back but smiling to my face. 

I was already getting to the point that I didn’t want to be around her anymore, I was realizing she was fake. So after I heard she was talking about me I blocked her number and cut all contact that I possibly could. 

Now the plot:

Saturday night my friend and roommate were drinking having a good time after a long week of 12-14 hour shifts. There is a new girl in the office and she is pretty cool so I invited her to come over for drinks.

When she gets to my house I see she has her brother and Ashley with her. At first I was cool, I was doing my own thing drinking and listening to music. After about 10 to 20 minutes I just couldn’t stand Ashley’s presence in my house. 

Ashley didn’t even say hello while walking into my house. I told her I didn’t want to be around her, and had already explained why. Idk why she decided to invite herself(according to the new girl in the office). 

I look down at my watch and saw that is was 10:22 pm and decided to announce that everyone else can stay but she had 8 minutes to get her things together and leave(she brought a bag I guess expecting she was staying and expecting to receive free drinks). 

She pretty much starts crying and acting like I’m the bad guy, when I have text proof that she is fake, talking about people, and latching on to friend groups after everyone stops talking to her. 

I made her wait outside for her ride. 

Am I the asshole?

Edit: 

we are 20’s in age

I told her via text weeks prior I didn’t want to talk to her or be around her

The new girl is not her friend, they live in the same complex because we live in condo type rep housing. So when the new girl was coming over, Ashley invited herself. The new girl didn’t know I didn’t like Ashley.

Slander isn’t cool, I work hard from my name.

Any further info I may have missed please ask before bashing me ✊🏽

c1iohl	2019-06-17 03:22:01	Gridde	AITA for making this joke about my friend (29M)'s girlfriend (24F)?	"Context:  My best friend and I have been practically brothers for about 15 years and though we bicker a bit we're very close and usuaullly very open with each other. 

He's recently begun dating a girl from his workplace, B (for about 6 months or so). She's a nice person on her own, but from what he's told me of their relationship she sounds incredibly controlling with him, and they argue frequently. She's a type 1 diabetic, and he says this is almost universally the reason behind their various arguments (as she often feels stressed, depressed or irratable from her condition).  They frequently socialise with her friends but she has met none of his besides me, and I know for fact that he has been forced to miss some events he was very excited about because she made plans that overlapped. They work together, get lunch together, spend almost all nights together, and the very few occasions I've seen him without her she texts him constantly and calls him in tears if he doesn't reply quickly enough.  Lastly, A has quietly cut ties with some (female) friends whom we see occasionally and all of whom he's had (very minor) history with in the past. 

Now, we have a friend from university (31F) who we'll call C; she's attractive but we've always been completely platonic with her and the three of us are all close friends. C recently broke up with her long term boyfriend and moved in with her parents outside the city as a result.  We haven't been able to see her since the break up as her parents live quite far away, so arranged a date we could all meet. We arranged this a few weeks in advance. On the eve we are meant to meet, A texts us saying that he has to bail as that night is the only night he can see his girlfriend that week and he's very sorry.

Joke:  I reply saying ""I refuse to believe B signed off on you only seeing her once this week"". He says something to the effect of ""she's not like that"" and C replies ""kinda sounds like she is, lol"".  Rest of the conversation is normal, we agree to try and reschedule for when our friend is next in the city.

Aftermath:  It turns out A was very, very upset with my joke as he took it to mean that I believe he has to run everything by B and that she controls his diary. He is completely correct in this assessment, but we talk at length over the next few days and I try to play it off as a joke that I didn't mean. While I seem to be outwardly forgiven (I've seen him a few times since), I later found out he's basically cut ties with C because of her comment.  

As sidenote, B sent me a message later in the week about them being at a rooftop bar, apparently confirming that they did see each. other outside work at least once more that week. 

So, AITA for making that joke? To me, this relationship is screaming 'red flags' but I don't know if I'm way off the mark, and either way, is it even my place at all to comment?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	368.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

We are both away visiting our family this weekend. He snapped me this am with a naughty message, and I replied with my own naughty selfie and message. In it, I said something like “Happy Daddy’s Day” because he’s a “dad” in relation to me. It’s not an incest reference or anything like it. In the gay community, a “daddy” just means someone older by a generation or more.

So he was silent for a few hours and when I finally asked him if things were ok, he texted me saying he was really hurt by me pointing out our age difference. I apologized but I didn’t realize I was insensitive to his feelings about our age difference. I definitely will not make the same mistake! :("	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1imf8	2019-06-17 03:15:31	srober38	AITA for not wanting to pay for the deposit?	"So back when we first signed the lease my roommate said they would take care of it and we would be fine. A few months later they got two cats that ripped up the floors and basically ensured the deposit would not be returned.
About 2 weeks ago my roommate told me that I still owed them for the deposit. Since we were two months away from the end, and since we were not going to be renewing, I asked if they were sure they would be getting the deposit back and they said yes. I suggested that since we were so close to the end to just forget about it and take the deposit (note: I was not planning on taking any of the deposit should it be returned.) and they agreed.
After that I got a cat, who has not done anything to destroy the apartment or ensure that the deposit would not be returned.
I was recently talking to the other roommate and the deposit came up. They said that we would definitely not be getting the deposit back cause of the first cats and I agreed. The first roommate was nearby and said that I still owed them for they deposit and I said that I would pay for the damage that my cat caused.

TL;DR: roommates have cats that destroyed the apartment, and they want me to pay part of the deposit now that I have a cat, even after they said I didn’t have too. 

AITA?

c1ilrb	2019-06-17 03:13:33		AITA For avoiding her?	"So there was this girl that I befriended this year in college. We had a class together in the Fall quarter and another this Spring quarter. Well we started studying pretty frequently together this past quarter and I started to like her. I eventually mustered the courage to ask her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she politely refused. She texted me afterwards and said that she was sorry and that she hoped we were still cool. I replied back letting her know that she had nothing to be sorry about and that we were still cool. 

&#x200B;

 I did see her once after that, but she was acting really really weird. She was extremely uncomfortable which made me really uncomfortable as well. I thought I had creeped her out but I guess she just didnt know how to act around me because she stopped showing up to class for a couple weeks but she would still text me. I would text her back and things were fine. I hadnt seen her for a couple weeks and although I think I handled the rejection gracefully, I was still pretty embarrassed and didnt really know how I would act around her. So we had a final this past week and we had texted about it a bit beforehand. 

&#x200B;

Long story short: as I was walking to class for the final I notice two people walking behind me and I even look back and make eye contact with the guy for a split second. I dont really look at the girl walking with him. I think nothing of it, its just two random strangers (or so I thought). I walk into the building and head to the restroom. As I walk out I see her at the doorway saying bye to the guy she was walking with, she was facing away from me.. Well my body went into fight or flight, so many thoughts ran through my head and I ended up  turning a corner and walked towards the classroom... I should have said hi or something :( , 

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure she saw me. I feel so bad, she was a really nice girl and now she probably thinks I'm an asshole for avoiding her. She didnt text me after the exam and I havent texted her because I dont wanna bother her. 

&#x200B;

I'm thinking the best course of action is to just cut my losses and move on.

&#x200B;

PS. I accepted her rejection and I wasnt/am not pursuing her anymore but she was really chill so I feel horrible about what happened."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1iln2	2019-06-17 03:13:14	temporarytommy45	AITA for telling my ex, who I still live with temporarily, that she can't have her new partner over?	"Me \[M\] and my ex \[F\] are both in our early 30s, have lived together in a small apartment for three years, and split up about two months ago. There was a rift that had been developing for about a year, based on some big differences we had always put off discussing. The biggest issue was having kids- she really wants a baby, and soon, and in a recent ""big talk"" I had my answer which was definitively no, no kids for me.

The breakup itself was very amicable, almost too positive, more like ""hey old friend, really wish you luck out there!"". That was probably part of what led to us putting off talking about stuff for so long. We're both very ""nice"", never fought, and our day-to-day was overall very comfortable. We still care about and respect each other a lot, it's just the romance and ""being on the same page"" was fading away.

We talked a few days after the breakup, and both agreed we could stand to live together for a few months while we figure out where we're going to end up. I'm in the process of buying a house, she's gonna start a new round of school in a few months, and in the meantime is searching for a new living situation. So staying in the apt together is very much for financial convenience. We each get one of the two bedrooms, and we now live like normal roommates (no post-breakup hook-ups with her), and it hasn't gotten weird, until....

The other day, she let me know she was seeing somebody. Which was not a shock, of course that is part of moving on, and I want her to live her life as much as I'm gonna live my life. Here's the part where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: she asked if her new person could stay over, or ""just come over and watch TV"". And I said I'd rather that didn't happen. I said I'd love for the apt that we have to temporarily share to be a neutral place, and that I'm not planning to bring anyone over, for fear it would make her uncomfortable.

I'll fully admit, the reason I don't want this is because it'll make me very unhappy. Not to mention if they do end up ""watching TV"", I'm going to be hearing it. The walls are pretty thin here- when our neighbors get it on, we basically have a front row seat. I feel like it's not too much to *not* want to hear someone you were with for years doing the dirty with someone new.

I've already heard all the ""you two shouldn't live together anymore"" stuff, that's obvious but not possible right now, so that shouldn't be part of the judgment here.

c1ikrl	2019-06-17 03:10:40		AITA for possibly getting my manager fired for assuming my ethnicity and linguistic background?	"Throwaway because this is a pretty unique situation. 

Background: I’m 19f. I recently moved to a new town within in a very diverse, high-immigrant urban area in the US. Upon moving here, I got a job teaching swim lessons. I’m frequently mistaken for being Russian, but I’m not. My first name is popular in Russia, my last name sounds Eastern European, and apparently I look Russian.

The situation: A few days ago, it was the first day of an eight-week lesson session. My manager, “Kate”, assigned me to teach a lot of preschool-aged kids. 

K = Kate, M = me

K: Hey, we have three little kids who speak Russian at home and don’t know English. I gave them all to you. Is that alright?

M: yeah sure, I’ve worked with kids who don’t know English. I know how to teach them.

K: no, I meant could you conduct the lesson in English and Russian?

M: No, that would require me to be able to speak Russian.

K: Oh...

M: What? What’s wrong?

K: I’m so sorry, I thought you could speak Russian! I told the moms that I could put the kids with a Russian-speaking instructor.

M: Why the fuck would you do that without asking me beforehand?

K: I don’t know, I just wasn’t thinking. It’s okay though, you can explain the situation to them, right?

M: Fuck no! I don’t want any parents getting upset with me for something that’s entirely your fault!

As soon as I got the chance, I called “Laura”, our supervisor, and explained the entire thing. Laura seemed very concerned and told me she plans to take the situation seriously. We’re meeting in person tomorrow to talk about it. I’m not sure whether or not Kate will be at the meeting. 

I looked in my part-time employee handbook and pretty much everything related to treating people differently based on ethnicity is punishable by termination of employment. I might have just gotten Kate fired over a simple (albeit ridiculously stupid) mistake. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Basically, I (23M) went out for some drinks at a bar with a colleague (24M) of mine and at one stage he found some friends (women) and invited them over to sit with us. We had a nice chat, stuck around for a couple of hours and then went our ways off home.   


The next day my colleague tells me that one of his friends told him I was hot when I went off to the bathroom, but that he forgot which one... I told him it was nice to hear but mentioned that he had basically failed me as a wingman (in a jokey kinda way, I'm not angry with him or anything).   


He thinks that this response was womanising and inappropriate considering that they were his friends but I disagree and think that he broke the 'brocode' in ignoring what was a clear sign of attraction and he should have at least done \_something\_.   


So am I an asshole for thinking that my friend should have set me up? Or is he correct in saying that the compliment meant shit.

Although where i appreciate music with less lyrical quality becuase of the instrumental/vibe, and i appreciate pop music for what it does, he doesnt and is very cynical.

So we have this party and all night hes bitching and moaning about the music, it was your typical party music, pop and ""mumble rap"" (i actually despise the term mumble rap but im guessing that is what yall call it)

Anyway after a few completely innapropriate song requests that i turned down, and more bitching he takes the aux and starts playing his own music, basically tech n9ne, eminem, johnny cash, just horrible songs to keep a good vibe in a party full of 19-22 year olds. (Not that i dont like songs by those artists, but they are not good party songs).

Anyway i ended up telling him if he didnt stop bitching and stop taking the aux i was kicking him out, and sure enough, 20 minutes later he plays ""dance with the devil"" by immortal technique effectivly killing the entire vibe of the party. 

So long story short i kicked him out and basically told him he wasnt invited to anymore of my parties if he didnt apologize to the hosts (me and 3 other friends) and promise to never do stuff like that again.

My (20) boyfriend (19M) have been dating for a few months. We're pretty joined at the hip and are almost always either with each other or in calls together for hours to days on end.

Him and his family had been invited to his brother's wedding. It's about 6 hours away and they plan on getting an Airbnb for it and stay for a few days. He'll be gone for a few days since he'll be busy spending time with his family which I think is great! That's also where the problem arises. At the same time I'll be going out with my family to celebrate both my younger siblings birthdays. I want to personally be there with them for it. Both his mom and his sister have asked my bf if I want to come to the wedding so he has asked me twice. Both times I said no, I want to be with my siblings.

I didn't think too much on it until I saw a post saying that you should support your SO when they have something they want to go to (ie a wedding). I do support him and would go if it was at any other time then when my sibs are celebrating growing up. That's something a big sibling should be there for.

My dad is a cpa, and 3-4 months ago I asked if he was going to do my taxes. He said ""no do them yourself or pay me to do them"" and then laughed. I thought he was being sarcastic, because a few days later he asked for my income information and such. I assumed he needed this information for filling out my taxes. Every so often afterwards I would ask him if he had finished (I only asked this once or twice because I was under the impression that if he was doing them for me, they will be done eventually and I shouldnt badger him about it). The couple of times I asked he responded with ""not yet"". And never told me that he was serious and wasnt actually going to do them. 

Recently I was informed he was serious and that he never did my taxes. 
I was told this 2 months after they were due. 

I'm now pissed off because not only are my taxes 2 months late, but I'm also right in the middle of exam season so in addition to having to study for 4 exams I now have to do taxes as well. 

As for the car, my parents have never expected me to pay for gas, and still don't. However since I do use the car to drive my siblings around and pick up groceries for my parents, I could help out by paying for the gas for the car I drive (we have 3 cars. My dad has his own truck, my mom has a Honda Pilot, and I drive an old minivan whose purpose is to be a vehicle for the younger drivers). 

Because of the fact my parents didnt have the decency to say ""we actually didnt do your taxes"" I dont feel like i have the decency to pay for gas. Would I be the asshole if i **asked** them to pay me back (roughly 200 dollars) for the gas I've paid for? 

Here are some additional comments I want to add:
- I wouldnt demand they pay me back. If they say no, then oh well. I stop paying for gas in the future.
- I dont want to sound like I expect my dad to do my taxes for free. I just wish he clarified when I asked him twice if he had done my taxes that he was never going to do them at all. I know he did initially say ""do them yourself"" but because of his overall personality and the fact he asked for my income info afterwards I thought he was kidding. 
- The moment I found out he didnt do my taxes I went into my room and spent the next 4 hours trying to figure out how to do them myself. They are complete and now just have to be mailed."	Everyone Sucks	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1if6i	2019-06-17 02:53:43	ThrowAwayFriend909	WIBTA if I stopped being friends with one of my childhood best friends because he is dating my Ex?	"  

So my Ex and I started dating back in highschool. We were together for 8 years by the time we broke up late last year. I was fully committed to this girl; she was my everything. Sure things weren't perfect but both of us were going through a lot at the time. Then it just sorta ended. The only straight answer I could really get from her was that she just wasn't happy and she didn't love me anymore. I was absolutely devastated. 

So fast forward about 4 months after we broke up (around February). All of this still feels very real and very recent to me. I was trying to stay positive as best I could, but it felt like my whole life had just been pissed on. My friends were my support net through all of this, so I was pretty excited when one of them wanted to get some dinner. Let's call him Mike. Backstory on Mike; we have been friends since we were 13, basically half of my life. He literally is one of only 3 people I consider to be my 'best friend'. So we meet up and he ends up telling me that he’s been seeing my ex for 2 months now and things are getting serious so they thought I should know.

We talked a few times in the following weeks and basically he still wanted for us to be friends. I, on the other hand, had never felt so betrayed before in my life. Maybe this is some dumb highscool way of thinking, but I believe that a friend's Ex is off limits, and if you do want to pursue them romantically, then at least make sure your friend is okay with it *first.* I get it, what's done is done, but that doesn't change the fact that he stabbed me in the back. And on top of it, he doesn't even seem that remorseful of it. He sorta apologized and started to recognize that he should have said something sooner. But then he just keeps defending himself saying he did what he thought was best for me, that he didn't want to hurt me.

Bull. Fucking. Shit.

If he was really doing what was best for me, he would have either stayed away from my Ex or talked to me about it ***first***. No, he did was he thought was best for him. He *knew* I wouldn't be okay with it so he kept it a secret for his sake. He *knew* that talking to me about it was gonna be a difficult fucking conversation and he didn't want to face up to. Mike is my best friends, but he is also a backstabber and a coward.

Mike and I didn't really talk much after that, but he ended up reaching out to me asking if we could talk and try to work things out. I said yes but I would need some time to think about things first and that brings us to now.

I really don't know what to do. They’ve been together for 6 months now. Part of me feels like maybe I am overreacting a little? Like my friends should be able to date whoever they want right? But another part of me just wants absolutely nothing to do with him anymore. As I said, he's a backstabber and a coward and I don't want to be friends with someone who treats their friends like that.

One of the guys on my team has been engaged for longer than he's worked here (3+ years). He (36) has become a good friend of mine. I'll call him Alex.

A few summers ago, I couldn't attend a work event. He texted me, very drunk, telling me how wonderful I was and that he would treat me right and that really knew how to treat a woman in bed. Totally out of the blue. I am zero amounts attracted to him and have never been flirty with him. I told him right then not to ever text me shit like that again. He apologized. 

Then his girlfriend/fiancée saw the messages and they had a big argument. They patched it up, I suppose. I have hung out with them both since, even having them at my parents place for dinner.

Since then, he has sent dirty texts to someone else on my team (it was welcomed by her) but that also fizzled out when I guess she lost interest.  Both of them told me the details of their messages so it's definitely true. 

He has since made a few weirdly sexual comments to me, always when drunk, and it always seemed like he was peacocking so I've generally just ignored it. 

Recently, someone new started at work. She's real cool and very friendly so I introduced her to the people on my team at a work pub night. She gets along with everyone and later in the night, I see the two of them cozying up in conversation... nothing wrong with that...

This past Friday, I see them chatting at the bar again and then he disappears without saying bye to anyone. Weird but I knew it was his girlfriend's birthday so I thought he left for that. Later on in the night, cool new girl offers to drive me home and she brings up Alex, asking if I knew why he left. I tell her the truth and she is absolutely surprised that he is engaged. She thought he was single because he was sending her super flirty messages over our corporate messaging app. 

This guy is my friend. I don't actually even like his girlfriend but I feel like I should tell her what he's doing. I would want to know if my boyfriend or fiance were acting like this. But we also work together and I'm concerned this could get messy if I interfere.  And it isn't my relationship or my business.

"A group of friends and I have started living in a house and we’re coming up on the tail end of two months, there’s been some issues but we’re making it. One problem that we encounter is some people forget to turn lights off when they’re done in a room. When we realize it we turn them off. 

We just got our electricity bill and we can definitely bring it down, which we will by being more cognizant of the lights. All in all it’s about 50 bucks each. 

We split everything evenly in payments for the house, that’s what the agreement is and always has been. One roommate is saying he refuses to pay 50 dollars for the light bill as he *never* forgets to turn any lights off. There are also a few other roommates who don’t forget to turn the lights off, and they’re not refusing to pay. He also has a lot of electrical appliances that suck up a lot of energy and he uses them frequently. He’s saying he’ll only pay 30 and we have to pick up the rest. 

Everyone else is pissed but said they’re going to drop it, I however don’t want to compromise on this. I wasn’t even there when he brought this up so it was sprung on me today. 

My logic is we don’t get to pick and choose what we pay and how much as we never have before. Splitting the 30 between the rest of us granted isn’t much money but it’s the principle of the thing. 

Also even a little bit of money can be the difference between me paying rent and being able to afford groceries or me paying rent and struggling through paychecks.

c1id4t	2019-06-17 02:47:32	myousername	AITA for not giving up my booth to a single mother with 2 kids?	"This afternoon, while on break from work, I went to grab a coffee and snack from a nearby cafe. Probably not relevant, but I'm a 20-something female.

This is a place with some booths, and some tables with chairs. The cafe was only about half full so I took one of the booths.

As I'm finishing my snack some lady with 2 kids comes up to me and asks if she can have my booth. I tell her that she can have it when I'm done my coffee, in about 10 minutes. She suggests I move to one of the tables so she can have the booth right away. I decline, and explain that I'm on break from work, I just want to relax and enjoy my coffee for a few more minutes in the cushioned comfort of a booth. 

She then tells me that she's a single mother and how she finds it easier to manage her 2 kids when sitting in a booth because they are stuck between her and the wall, and that I'm ""just one person taking up a table for four"" (fair enough). She wasn't being especially rude, maybe just a little bit entitled. This guilt-tripping interaction was beginning to irritate me, so I asked her to leave me alone. She left in a huff, muttering under her breath.

There weren't any more booths so she took one of the tables. I dunno why, maybe I was just feeling petty, but I took my good sweet time finishing my coffee, stretching 10 minutes into about 20 minutes. In the meantime, I noticed her kids were being little shits. Both were shouting and got up from their seats multiple times and ran in opposite directions, so she struggled to keep them seated. She glared at me intermittently like I'm some kind of asshole.

Eventually I left, didn't look back to see if she took my booth or not. 

Am I the asshole in this interaction?

Edit: Many of you are saying I'm the asshole for stretching it out to 20 minutes instead of 10 like I first told her. I should have mentioned that 20 minutes was the amount of time I had left on my break. If she hadn't asked me, that's the amount of time I would have taken. When she first asked, I thought to myself, ""well, there's no harm leaving a few minutes early, but I just want to finish my coffee in peace"". When she kept pushing, I no longer felt like extending that courtesy. It was only an extra ten minutes, it's not like I stayed for an hour. It's probably still petty, just wanted to explain my reasoning."	Not the A-hole	0	0	119.0	36.0	0.0	0.0

Every day I enjoy some light reading and a lunch at the same cafe and at the same table. The cafe is mostly empty unless a tour bus has arrived. On this particular day, I arrive a few minutes before the bus and sit in my usual spot - which just happens to be under a large ceiling fan. 

The tourists eventually start waddling in and a woman, probably in her early to mid 70s approaches my table almost instantly and says 'This is where I wanted to sit.' I replied 'Okay', I chuckled slightly and continued reading my book. The woman then leant on the table for what seemed like the better part of a minute until she let out an audible huff and sat at the table adjacent from me.

Her fellow tour friends eventually joined her and she proceeded to complain about how she wanted the table I was sitting at and how I wouldn't move despite being on my own and a younger man. This was designed to be loud enough for me to hear. When the waitress arrived at the table, the woman asked if there was another table with a fan (despite my table visibly being the only one) and then relayed the story of my reluctance to give up my table once more. The waitress came over and gave me a playful scolding - which added to the awkwardness.

It was slightly embarrassing for me but it wasn't all that hot and I felt my principles were more important here. The lady approached with an expectation that I would vacate the seat. This wasn't for mobility but so she could be slightly more comfortable than what she would've been elsewhere. I had no desire to budge.

Adversely, if I had arrived and this table was taken, I would under no circumstances demand the person swap for me. It is only my regular seat due to the cafe usually being empty.

My mother thinks I should've given up the seat and said I wasn't being considerate of her age."	Not the A-hole	0	0	43.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

It was scratched and worn by the years but it still meant a lot to me, after being pestered by my family all day i gave in and gave it to him under the condition that he give it back by christmas, he said yes and that was 6 years ago,  i've had it back for a week by sheer luck until now when my mom gave it to him it doesn't help that my mom is basically the one that spoils him the most but after he brought me back a broken case for a game this was it.

Edit: in our conversations I suggested coffee for our first meet up. For those wondering.

Update: SWEET KARMIC JUSTICE! Upon moving to the bar and talking to the bartender I found out that this girl had an open tab before I arrived. She LEFT HER DRIVER'S LICENSE AT THE BAR. According to the bartender she's a shitty tipper and she's probably next door trying to get free drinks at the pool hall. Since her tab was open and she's probably coming back anyway, he agreed to move her food items over to her tab. He said, ""fuck it it's not like she's gonna tip me anyways.""

Update again: WOW HOLY SHIT THIS BLEW UP! Thanks kind stranger for the gold! 

I still have yet to hear back from her even though I'm sure she's had to have gone back to close her tab. I'm not really down with confrontation, so I prefer it that way. Also RIP my in box!

&#x200B;

Background - I am a single mother with a teenager.  Teen is now 16 so not such a huge deal anymore but it is what it is.  I also work full-time Monday-Friday and am gone about 11 sometimes 12 hours a day.  I do ok but llving in so cal I struggle with mortgage and stuff, I don't get child support.  I am stressed.  


My mother has advanced dementia and can't be left alone.  My father is mid-seventies and is the prime care taker.  He's not rich but definitely has assets.  I am one of three children but my siblings moved out of state and are never around.  Lately I've been watching my mother most Saturday, anywhere from 6 to 12 hours  so my father can get a break.  He hires a care taker a few other times during the week.  Please believe I love my parents both very much.    


So this is it.  I was pooped out today, I slept in until 10 after a brief 6 am dog potty break, then took my dog out for a couple of hours, then put my pjs on and started to clean the house.  My father calls around 630 asking if i'd like to join them out for dinner \*heart break\* but I have just totally had it with the week and promised to take him out another time.  Here's where it gets yuckier, the same thing happened on mothers day.  I had been with my mom for 10 hours the day before, brought her flowers on mothers day and then just went home.    


I  told my brother this and he thinks I'm an asshole.  In a way I agree, it shouldn't have been totally hard for me but at the same time I feel like the time I put in towards my mother deserves some credit and I just wanted a day to do chores and chill out.    


TLDR - I spent 7 hours at my parents house yesterday helping with my ailing mother, I didn't think it was necessary to go over again today for Father's day.  I love my father, but wanted a day to myself."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I know it sounds unreasonable for me to get upset about a normal bodily function but hear me out. My boyfriend almost always falls asleep whenever we spend time together (we see each other almost everyday) and at first it didn’t bother me but it became a constant thing. I’ve spoken to him before that it bothers me now when he does it because I want to spend time and do things with him.  He’ll fall asleep at even 5 or 6 PM and I’ll wake him up about an hour later to let him know that I’m getting a little bored and that I’d like for us to do something. Sometimes he’ll wake up but it’s becoming more frequent that he’ll respond to me but fall asleep again a few minutes later. When I wake him up to ask him to do something it seems like he’s not interested most of the time but if he gets a call from his friends asking him to come out then he’ll be up and ready right away.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We have an extra guest room that we have rented out in the past. Doing so subsequently lowered rent and split utilities an additional way.

The property manager sent out a text asking the housemates if it was alright to move them into the guest room. I said I'd be fine if we get a prorated portion of our rent back and they pay a portion of the utilities this month. 

The property manager responded ""

This is to help him out. Not for us to save 13 days rent... If you're not okay with it without getting something out of it then I'll just tell him to deal with his current situation. You tell me"" 

I have no clue who this new tenant is, their situation, etc. I am entering grad school and money is going to be tight so any amount back would really help.

I have 2 best friends (Charlotte & Emily) since the first day of preschool in 1990 who are 2 of my bridesmaids. Emily can afford it, Charlotte is a single mum struggling financially. Her mum can babysit, I have offered to pay for Charlotte's flights, and Emily is allowing her to stay in her hotel room free of charge. 

I have a brother (James). I have never been close to him we are just chalk/cheese. 4 years apart but more like 6 as he repeated Grade 1/I skipped grade 2. We are just totally different people and while we don't necessarily HATE each other, we'd never have chosen to have each other in our lives.
 
He has a 6-year-old daughter (Ava). I am close to her. James’ wife of several years (Kate) has NEVER liked me & is generally unpleasant. Kate looked down on me for being single when we first met, and always does the thing to both my father and I where she makes mean comments and then tries to pretend they’re jokes but everyone knows they are not. She has caused arguments in our family, and they like to live above their means, guilt us for money, and then get angry if we refuse.

I would like Ava to be at my wedding, but I know James and Kate can't afford it. I offered to pay for Ava & James’ flights. He asked about Kate, but I can’t afford to fly Kate over because I'm need to fly Charlotte over to be one of my bridesmaids. I said Kate can come to the wedding, but I can’t afford to pay for her. If it is just James and Ava, my parents will be fine with them sharing the Air B&B but there is no way my father share Kate and we both know it. James said I should pay for his hotel and and Kate's airfares.

I'm doing decently enough to pay for my best friend and niece to come to my wedding, but not a hotel/flight for Kate. Kate refuses to work despite the fact they struggle and has my brother work 12-14 hour days to support her while at the same time, looking down on people who work in retail or food service. If Kate wants to come to Switzerland, she can get a *job*.
 
My brother is calling me an asshole and going absolutely off at me for this and doing on about ""family FIRST"" and how ""you’re disrespecting Kate"". 

My brother asked if Kate could come instead of Ava if I can afford 2 flights and I said no WAY. I am willing to pay for my niece but I am NOT going to pay for James and Kate to leave her at home and have a free holiday in Switzerland.

I can't stand Kate. I don't care if she can't come, but I know I have to invite her. But even if I liked her, I can't afford to pay her expenses. He is angry I am choosing Charlotte over Kate. My brother thinks that Kate being my sister in law means she trumps my friends, but I believe that a 29 year long friendship with someone who has always been kind to me and has always supported me and is doing the best she can trumps ""woman who has never been nice to me and chooses not to work"".

There's been tension with my family for a while, as I am gay and they refuse to acknowledge it. While I've been forced to have off an on jobs, I dont work and am struggling to find someplace near me that would be manageable with 16-20 credit hours on my place. 

About 6 months ago, they put this ""disney circle"" on our network, essentially monitoring everything I do online. Along with this, It's expected that I either have my doors open at all times, or always be ok with someone barging into my room (family occasionally searches). 

Frustrated, Ive bypassed it a couple times but constantly brought to their attention that I do not like it and think I ought to have privacy. While I've been initially upset over it, I still wonder if I really have a right to anything. They're covering most of my college ( scholarships at least cover most of it, so it's not too much of a burden but with room and board and other fees it's still tiers cheaper staying at home), and still pay for food. I pay for clothes and gas with my savings, and most anything else.

They tell me that since it's their home, they have the rules, and that demanding to use the internet is entitled of me. In all honesty, I dont know how to respond. I bring nothing to the family besides chore work, and financially burden them so they expect to have authority over me. Other family members and church friends tend to side with them.

So, Am I the asshole here (an entitled bitch?)? In my view, I feel stuck, with little understanding of the world besides what I see in school- however, they do have the right to the house and internet, and since I dont provide anything for them I don't have a say in it, even if it inconveniences me.  

(I am willing to give more details if necessary, it's a mess ive been struggling with for a while and so it all kinda meshes together)

EDIT- To add, most of my good friends now are a bit of a distance away from me. They're great friends, but whenever I lose internet access It'll make it harder for me. As of now, most of the friends I'm allowed to hang out with are ""goody goody"" christian friends, some of which are fun, but they aren't supportive and I feel really out of place. Just dont have a lot in common with them, so It's usually awkward.

Also, I seriously will take advice on resources to get me out of here. I kinda feel like I'm years behind other people since I've been sheltered more than everyone else."	Not the A-hole	0	0	369.0	50.0	0.0	0.0
c1i3l7	2019-06-17 02:19:06		WIBTA if I never told my best friend the truth to the huge lie I told her?	"Okay, so I already know that I am TA for what I did. Basically, almost 3 years ago (at the time I was 14 or 15) my friend (we will call him Tucker) got expelled from our high school for selling pot brownies. Now he is a very nice guy if you know him but may seem like a jerk from an outside view. Anyway, a few days later he texts me and asks me to find out who ratted on him. He told me he would pay me $300 if I found out, it also just so happened that my dad needed $300 for his truck to be fixed (I live in a large and poor family so my dad was most likely going to lose his job if he didn't get his truck fixed) I seen this as an opportunity to do something to help my dad. 

A few days after that I was talking to a very good friend of mine (we will call her Jenny) and she told me that her sister (we will call her Lily) had went to the officer about Tucker. So I am like BOOM case solved. I text Tucker and make sure nothing bad is going to happen to Lily (at this point I have known him for a little over a year and he has never once lied to me so I trusted him) then I tell him who ratted and how I found out. He promised to not tell anyone it was me that told him and nothing bad ever happened to Lily, other than her getting a text from Tucker saying how mad he was that she ratted (it turns out that they were actually decent friends at the time)

Now, here's where I might be a double A-hole. So I got a text from Jenny later that day and she blew up on me saying I was the only person that she told and that I am a horrible person (and lets face it, I am) so I call her and talk to her for about 2 hours and eventually convince her that I DIDN'T tell Tucker anything, and that one of the student helpers in the office had to hear her talking to someone. She actually believed me.

I have thought about telling her everything, but there are moments where she confides in me and trusts me with her deepest secrets. Over the past 2 or 3 years me and her have become super close. She tells me everything. She has even told me secrets that she would NEVER tell anyone else.

It is probably best to note that I don't remember much of that year (when everything happened) because I was taking un-prescribed pills and would go through my day numb as can be. It was a dark time for me. But I can honestly say I am a different person than I was then, it doesn't change what I did though. So WIBTA if I never told her? Me and her have a strong friendship and I don't want to lose that. Also Tucker is the only person that knows it was me and he moved and joined the Marines a few months ago."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My youngest daughter (18F), who we’ll call K, is going to be a freshman in college this fall at the same school my older daughter (19F), who we’ll call M, goes to (M will be a junior). 

K is living on campus in the dorms. There are several different dorms, and let me tell you, they are NOT created equal. First you have the older ones with down the hall bathrooms and basement laundry- more “standard” dorms; then you have those that are newer and nicer, with laundry on every floors, AC, an elevator, study rooms, etc- more “deluxe” dorms. Of course, the deluxe ones are more expensive than the standard ones. My husband and I told K that she would be living in a standard dorm, just like we made M do her freshman year (she lives in an apartment now).

Here’s the thing- K found a roommate on her school’s “class of ‘23” Facebook page, and her roommate REALLY wants to live in one of the deluxe dorms, something she did not mention when she said she was looking for a roommate. Since K (understandingly) doesn’t want to argue with her, after giving it some thought, I decided that I would be okay with K living in one of the deluxe dorms. While it’s more than what I wanted to pay, we could still afford it.

I told my husband about this and he doesn’t like this idea. He told me that this was not what we had agreed on, and that K could find another roommate if her current one felt so strongly about living in a deluxe one (of course, this would NOT go over well and the current roommate would be pissed if K decided to not live with her anymore, so that’s not gonna happen). He eventually (but VERY begrudgingly) gave in, but he also told me that it was not fair to M because we had told her that she had to live in one of the standard ones that were not as nice. The thing is though, unlike K, M opted to random roommate, so she was never in a kind of situation her sister is in. 

While M says it doesn’t matter, I feel like she’s not telling the truth.

When my boyfriend (we’ll call him N) was in high school, his ex girlfriend (we’ll call her E) died unexpectedly. They were broken up but mainly because she moved to another state. He still loves her and her death has haunted him for the past three years. 

N and I started dating two years ago, and I knew E, but I was not as close to her as he was. 

Throughout our relationship I often felt that he loved her more than me. This upset me, but I loved him and I just wanted to be there for him. I often felt that he would compare me to her, and I’d ask him not too. He mostly stopped, but still talked about her in a way that made it seem like he’d do anything to be with her again. It got to the point where I’d feel jealous of E, and felt that N would care for me more if I were gone. 

About a year into our relationship, I got the courage to talk to my therapist about this. This helped me a lot and I eventually stopped feeling like I should be jealous of E. Before today she was the only person who knew of my feelings. 

This brings me to today. I was physically feeling like shit (migraine, heartburn, etc) and I had been struggling mentally also. Our relationship has also been in a rough patch, leaving me feeling anxious and like I am not good enough. We were at N’s house. I did some homework and N picked up a book. He said it was E’s favorite. I asked him if he knew my favorite book (which I had suggested he read numerous times) and he said no. After I finished studying, I told him I wanted to go home. He asked why, and I cited my physical complaints, and said “I also feel inferior to a dead girl.” 

He flipped out and started yelling, saying that I should not have called her a “dead girl” We fought more about how he talked about her and how that had upset me. He said I had crossed a line and that he needed space, and I took my stuff from his house and walked home. 

My question is, AITA for telling him how I felt about his ex girlfriend? I am willing to apologize if I am in the wrong, but I have been upset about this for much too long and I don’t think I’m thinking straight."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

c1hy14	2019-06-17 02:02:34	kupur	WIBTA if I harrassed my internet support every hour	"Long story short: Our internet is awful.

&#x200B;

Every hour, our internet cuts out for anywhere between 30 seconds to 2 minutes. This actually happens multiple times an hour. It's gotten to the point where I can't get too involved in using the internet (for work or watching videos) without being at risk for suddenly losing my connection.

&#x200B;

Apparently, our service is so bad because we are on an old wire or something. The first few houses in our neighborhood have great wifi because they ran a new line through them. However, the rest of the neighborhood has terrible service, just like us. They have told us that our neighborhood is low priority because we are stuck behind new neighborhoods. AKA, every time a brand new, just-built neighborhood is developed, their internet wires are prioritized first. They don't know when they will get to us, if ever.

&#x200B;

I want to call and complain every time the internet cuts out to show them that this. is. a. real. problem. I'm not expecting them to come out and rewire everyone (I wish...). In all honesty, I'm expecting a credit to our account or something, because this is just ridiculous. The internet is barely usable and I don't feel it's worth paying $50 a month for.

c1hwpc	2019-06-17 01:58:56	Boglin007	AITA for wanting to stay at diner until advertised closing time?	"It was about 11:20 PM and I was hungry so I went to a local diner - it said online that it closed at midnight. I was served quickly and was sitting eating my food when the owner/manager came over and said, “I’m sorry, we need to close now” (implying I needed to leave). I wasn't even halfway through my food. I checked the time - it was 11:40, so I assumed the internet had been wrong and they really closed at 11:30, so I said, “Oh, sorry, I thought you were open until midnight.” The guy confirmed that they did indeed close at midnight but that they “need\[ed\] to start closing up now.” I argued a bit - asking why I couldn’t just stay for 5 or 10 minutes to eat a bit more and why they couldn’t clean everything but my table while I was finishing and then quickly clean my stuff when I left. But the guy wouldn’t give me any leeway so I ended up leaving having only eaten a bit of the food. I still gave the waiter a 20% tip because it wasn’t his fault.   


All that seems fairly clear-cut I guess, but here’s why I think I may have been (at least a bit of) an asshole: I was the only person in the diner by then and it was a Saturday night, so I can understand that the staff saw an opportunity to get out a little early and enjoy their evening (and I can relate to that having worked customer service in the past). I could also have taken the rest of my food to go, but I have pretty severe OCD (diagnosed by psychiatrist), which makes me very anxious about eating in my apartment (in case I make a mess) so it would not have been an enjoyable experience for me, and I just wanted to enjoy my meal. I guess I could have eaten it outside but again, that’s awkward and not relaxing. So, am I the asshole for wanting to stay and finish my food, even though it would have meant the staff having to hang around for another 20 minutes?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	175.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

c1hwah	2019-06-17 01:57:43		AITA for getting upset that my boyfriend didn't do anything for my father on Father's Day?	"My boyfriend (25) and I (27) have been dating for 3 years now. While I only live with my father, he pretty much has allowed my boyfriend to move in with us and spend all the time he wants at my house (even when we are not there). My father has been completely warm and welcoming towards my boyfriend and treats him great. My father doesn't ask us for a single dime and does things such as allowing us to take his card to go food shopping and often buys us expensive dinners (hibachi, etc). He even went as far as buying my boyfriend a really expensive gaming console for his birthday. I am extremely grateful that my dad is so accepting and selfless, especially right from the start of us dating. He is the single most selfless person I know. 

Now to get into my boyfriend's family. His father is no longer in his life. I could never get a true answer out of him as to why he hasn't been apart of his life but I know it's been for some time and he doesn't plan on changing that. So his mom has been raising him and by herself for nearly 10 years until 3 years ago when he practically moved in with me. I should also mentions that he definitely prefers spending time at my house because his mom VERY often nags him for money and while he's here, she can't really do that.


Last year (and I'm pretty sure the year prior) I had given his mom a bouquet of flowers for mother's day as just a simple gesture to show I appreciate the son she's raised. I hadn't gotten the chance this year as my job interfered with alot of things that weekend but I still made an effort to contact her and wish her a happy day.

Last night while doing the final touches on my father's day gift, my boyfriend spoke of getting him something and while I said he didn't have to, I had wished he would. Not even a gift but even just a card would be thoughtful and show how appreciative he is towards all of the things my father has done for him while living here.

This morning when we woke up, he wished him a happy father's day. We had plans to run out and grab something for the dinner I had planned for him and while out again, my boyfriend made a remark about getting him something when he got out of work.
Well he's back from work and nothing.
I know I probably shouldn't be disappointed and I sound like a bitch but my father works HARD. He puts in so much work to make our life as simple as possible. My boyfriend has it made here. And I just don't think he appreciates all my father does for him and it genuinely upsets me. I also don't like the fact that he brought up that he would do something for him TWICE and did not stand by his word. Maybe I should have spoken up if I really wanted him to do something, I don't know. I'm just distraught over it and I need to know; AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1hw33	2019-06-17 01:57:08		AITA for asking my friend about her job?	"For the last couple weeks I had been searching for a part time job to accommodate my schedule. 6 days ago I texted my friend and asked about her part time job as a personal shopper. She replied and said it was a personal “chef” job. She never talks about it because she has another job that she focuses on more and puts more hours into. 

Anyway, I asked if the hours were flexible, and said that I was asking because I had thought she said she was planning on quitting sometime. All of a sudden she got defensive and denied that, replying she was “looking for other opportunities.” I told her I was asking about the job because I was looking for work that would accommodate my schedule. I said that if she ended up leaving, maybe I could take her place. 

She basically replied that it would be too complex for me without asking about my cooking skills. I’m a pretty good cook. She didn’t go to culinary school or anything, so i doubt its anything I couldn’t handle. Her whole tone throughout the conversation was just so off-putting. We haven’t talked since.

Me being really socially anxious/awkward finds this really difficult and can get headaches when there are too many people (I don’t know why) so I already don’t like going to the hangouts often. I don’t like to say anything because she had been bullied and still doesn’t really get the whole friend group thing. I just keep cancelling because I don’t want to try make conversation with a person who is only here to spend time with k and doesn’t really talk to the rest of us. Any advice?

"So my bf (25) has promised to be better with managing his money bc we’re trying to save for a future together but it’s been difficult bc he spends every penny he earns. (I can’t move forward with the relationship unless he shows some sort of responsibility that I can trust) 

For Father’s Day he spent the day with his dad, a known person to take advantage of his inability to control his spending. My bf gets home and we were talking about our days. He admitted to splitting a 300 dollar umbrella for a fathers day gift and paid for dinner at a fancy restaurant for his whole family, most likely another couple hundred.  ( he states that some people gave him cash to contribute - but usually when this happens some one throws up a 20 for a 50 dollar meal. ) 

He’s proclaiming he did well with spending today, even though he likely spent around 400 and makes about 700 a week. And he tells me he saved by not getting his mother a gift for her recent birthday. Which is a lie bc we use the same amazon account and I saw he bought her a 100 bedspread with a gift receipt that said hbd. When I told him I saw this he gets super mad, raised his voice and said “it’s different for me... I have TWO parents!” 

He said this knowing my father has never been in my life. He’s never met him. My father is an alcoholic that lives 20 hours away and can’t maintain any relationship bc of his addiction and mental health.  Me and all his other family choose not to have contact with him. 

Should I be offended by this ? I feel as though he said it as a sly to me bc I revealed a lie.

I tried to confront her and tell her to stop but she just got mad and always complains that she needs to study or some other excuse.

c1huhp	2019-06-17 01:52:20	AyeAmScottishYaCunt	WIBTA by telling my landlady how messy my roommates leave the house?	"Currently living in a ‘big’ small surf town that’s notoriously difficult to find a place to rent. Most people stay for the season (including myself) and really struggle to find a genuinely nice place to live. I’m lucky enough to have somewhere.

To cut a long story short, I lived in the house for the last 3 seasons, the landlady loves me and knows I’m pretty damn clean (hence why she always saves me a room to come back). The people I’m living with are cool but are fucking slobs. Yeah they do their dishes for the most part but all the common living areas are disgusting. Floors never sweeped, sink full off scum & bits of food in the drain, carpets never hoovered, crumbs on the table everywhere, stains, lights/heaters left on, bins never emptied and just rubbish stacked up like jenga etc. No one really gives a shit about keeping the place clean for everyone else or properly cleaning up after themselves. 

When I moved in my landlady came early to get my room ready and had a breakdown at the mess of the place - showed me pics and completely blew up at everyone. It was pretty disgusting, but it’s gone in one ear and out the other for everyone here. She’s kicked people out in the past for not looking after the place. And I don’t want to to be lumped in with everyone else when she sees the mess. My first week moving in I cleaned up EVERYTHING and it was a pigsty after a week. I sweep the floors in the morning whilst boiling the kettle and when I come home at night I can’t even walk barefoot through the kitchen or my feet come out black. I’ve had enough. 

She wants names to start kicking people out & although I like everyone I’m really considering giving them to her (everyone except 1 couple and a new girl who moved in)

Today is father's day.  For me this is my big day. I look forward to this day more than any other holiday. I take great pride in my kids and my role as a dad so I look forward to the extra love from my kids and the clever fathers day crafts they concoct at school! 

My kids live with Mom and step dad and admittedly I'm jealous of the time he gets to spend with them. Up until the time he was in the picture I would get all the fathers day love, and shamelessly soaked it up. For the past years since hes been around,my kids have shown up with no craft. Not sure if this was my ex's doing or not. When I ask where the crafts are they say they gave them to step dad. The first year I said nothing even though it hurt my feelings. The second year I mentioned to them that it hurt my feelings and that I would also like a craft. Its continued every year...

This year my son showed up with a dollar store keychain instead of his craft and I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to say something. I told him how it hurt my feelings again that he gave his school craft to step dad and didnt make me a craft, and he could take the keychain back. I gave him some money to buy some craft supplies and asked him to bring something back next visit. 

Not sure what rattled me more, that so little thought or effort was put into the gift, or that step dad keeps getting my fathers day crafts (I really cherish those). I think I hurt his feelings rejecting his gift and I feel terrible, but I somehow I feel like this will help him understand how important this is to me and how his decisions hurt me. 

It's not that I think step dad shouldn't get any love. The kids should make an effort to show us both love. They could just make an extra craft! Just not sure if I handled this properly. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

In the past few years, I've lost a lot of weight in part due to an exercise regime that I've implemented upon myself. I've also reduced a lot of my portions because I've realised that the more I eat, the more weight I tend to put on. Now comes my brother, who tells me that if I want to put muscle, I have to eat large portions and stay in the gym for several hours. I was like, ""alright, thanks for your input"". Mind you, my main goal is to stay healthy, not build muscle. 

Now here comes another situation. As soon as I hit the gym and run on the treadmill, I realise that he has recorded me running. I ask him why he did that, and he told me, ""your feet move whenever you run and that's not a good sign"". Again, I say ""thanks for your input"" and I move along. 

I have various disabilities such as ADHD, and my family doesn't agree with my diagnoses. My brother comes about and tells me that ""it's a confirmation bias"" because I don't act like I have ADHD at all. I again get annoyed with this, and leave the room because I don't want to put up with my family's shenanigans.

And last but not least, I often drink protein shakes after working out and I realised it was putting pressure on my kidneys. I stopped and told my family about it, and again my brother tried to give some advice. At this point, I've had with him and I tell him: ""You are not a medical professional. Just because you are a medical student doesn't mean you can get to hand out free advice whenever you feel like. You have codes and guidelines to follow as a doctor, so stick to that.""

Then my family buts in and says things ""he's just looking out for you"", ""you shouldn't have said that to him"", and so on. 

I know that he's my brother, and that he's trying to help, but it feels extremely irritating to put up with this because I feel like he's relegating me to a position of inferiority. I mean it's not like I'm making reckless decisions where I need constant intervening, and I'm not an absolute idiot or anything.

I quit drinking coffee about 6-months ago.

My family obviously knows these things.  Adding to this is the fact that I got my wife a $300 watch for mother's day.  Frankly, I would have been happier with no gift and just dinner tonight.  I haven't said anything.  I'm pouting instead. I'll admit, I'm depressed about a few other things too right now, but I have to ask to return the coffee maker, and that will start a conversation and I don't know what I'll say.  Why would I keep it.  We now have THREE coffee makers and one coffee drinker in the house.  WTF?

Edit: Elementary aged kids.  They didn't buy anything.  They could have been swayed to make other choices even if they 'picked it out'.  Yes, it's the thought that counts.  I'm going to stop reading these for a bit and go be an adult father.  Thank you.

c1hpkf	2019-06-17 01:37:48	DoofComplex	AITA for putting most of the junk in our room on my brother’s bed?	"It’s not like he isn’t used to this practice.

I’ve shared a room with my older brother for 18 years now. We’re 7 years apart and he’s still living at home at age 25. For as long as I can remember, whenever our room has been messy, I have either cleaned it or come home from school to a mountain of my belongings on my bed. The most annoying part about these experiences is that even if something is obviously not mine, it will be on my bed because my brother knows that it is not his. Not his property, not his problem. It becomes *my* problem.

Again, he has thrown everything in the room that isn’t his into my bed for *me* to clean. I’ve never done something like that while cleaning the room because I am considerate. Considerate of the fact that, after someone comes home from work/school/whatever, the LAST thing they want to do is clean. He obviously hasn’t considered that when piling things on top of *my* bed. He can be a pretty inconsiderate person.

In the past I haven’t been the best at cleaning up behind myself, but as I’ve matured, I do so a lot more often. I can’t say the same for my brother though, who often likes to criticize others when they don’t practice the most hygienic things, which is hypocritical of him because he isn’t the most hygienic when it comes to cleaning the room. My cousin actually stayed with us for a while and pointed this out to me. I didn’t even notice and wouldn’t have thought of it, I just try not to cause conflict.

Just yesterday my brother and I had another conflict. Since the last one I just described, I’ve learned how to keep my emotions in check and stay unbothered by his words. To make this post much shorter, I’ll sum it up. He nearly threw something of mine away, and while I left to get it I slammed the door on my way out, and he opened it immediately and yelled “What?” He said it in the way someone would say when they’re about to get in a fight. I don’t know why, but he always wants to solve conflicts with violence. He can do this because he either used to or does work out and is therefore physically stronger than me. What a weak-minded person. The day he touches me is the day I stop being friendly and the day I petition to get him kicked out of our mom’s house. I love him but he can be such a weak-minded asshole. We wouldn’t even get along if I weren’t such a passive person, I let a lot of shit slide.

The best part about cleaning the shit up from the corner is that all of it was his. He’ll have to figure out where to put everything after he gets off from his 8-hour shift. I shouldn’t feel this good for being an asshole but it was a long time coming, given that he’s done it several times without regard for how I felt. It feels therapeutic, as I need to stop thinking about other people when they don’t think about me.

c1howy	2019-06-17 01:35:46	ndnocean	AITA for paying my gym membership online rather than with the employee?	"So I signed up last year at the local LA Fitness for membership. I signed up for the pay once a year option since it was affordable and saved me a little money during the year on those dumb fees they love to charge. 
Anyways. A little back story. Back a couple months ago. My year was coming to an end and I started getting calls about a month early about paying for the next year. It was annoying because locations outside my local gyms were calling me everyday. Like ones from Florida were calling me. Also the employees would remind me everytime I checked in when I entered to workout. 
I know I could have just went ahead and paid because I knew I was going to continue my membership. But I knew what day I was suppose to pay and I had planned out my finances accordingly for when I was going to pay. 
So probably 2 weeks before I planned to pay. The manager at the location I frequent stopped me again and tried to convince me to pay with her (basically they get commission according to my roommate). I didn’t have my wallet on me but I said I would get it paid and she basically was saying to make sure I got it paid with her. 
So when the day came that I wanted to pay. She wasn’t in and when I left the gym. I paid for it online. At this point I could have waited to pay until I saw her again. 
So my roommate saw me paying it online and he goes to the gym with me so he knew about the calls and conversations with the employee and manager. He said basically it was messed up that I did that because I took away (extra) money from the employee and if I had planned to pay it online, I should have done it before the employees starting called and informing me at the location. I personally don’t think it matters because I didn’t make any promises to the manager and I made an effort to see if she was at the gym before I did. 

So AITA?

Edit: I forgot to add that I only felt like an asshole after going back to the gym a couple times when the manager was there, not when my roommate said something. I noticed that the manager stopped smiling at me (just her whole attitude seemed different towards me) when I came in but still would for other guest or my roommate. It’s all back to normal now that it’s been a couple months since. So I felt bad that she might have saw that I paid and didn’t do that with her."	Not the A-hole	0	0	2.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

a week or two ago i decided to send him a message and it went eh. he said he was gonna do drugs and when i tried convincing him otherwise he didnt listen.

now a few days ago i posted a cute drawing of a pokemon i was proud of, and he just commented 'i love you'in the comments (we used to have this inside joke when we were closer, but it just felt weird saying it now) so i deleted it, and didnt talk to him about it at all

. My sister Judy is newly pregnant; she has a one year old son. My other sister Marie has four kids. I help Marie raise her kids to the point we live together and are a team. One of her kids is disabled. We ran to the mall to fix a broken iPhone. The plan was to see Judy after because she lives five minutes from the mall. Judy decides to pack up her son and meet us at the mall. While we were waiting for the phone we decided to stop in a preteen- teenage store and browse for Marie’s 13 year old. The 13 year old is not allowed to wear booty shorts, crop tops or belly shirts. She wanted to try on a shirt that was slightly off the shoulder and was allowed to get it with the conditions a tank top must be worn with it.

Judy decides during this time to critique my sisters and mines parenting style. Judy is a teacher and told Marie that she’s the parent and shouldn’t let her dress like that and should pick her clothes and tell her no. Marie says “ I pick my fights, she must wear it with a tank, it’s not a crop top or scandalous. It’s shoulders.” Judy gets silent and we go onto another store without Marie.

Judy is a twin. Judy and her twin have always been very thin and for lack of better terms flat chested. Marie and I are busty women. I am of average weight and Marie is very aware she’s overweight due to a thyroid issue and trying to rectify it. Judy is the type of person who likes to commit on people’s weights and criticize. During Marie’s absence Judy took it upon herself to comment on Marie being overweight and comment “she lets Emmy dress in clothes like that because she’s trying to live through her. “ I said “it’s not that scandalous, people have different comfort levels of modesty and she choosing what to draw the line on. At the end of the day it’s not your child and you don’t have a lot of say. You can do what you please with your kids.” I then proceeded to tell her that growing up a lot of her twin and hers body comments mad a lasting impression and made us insecure. the twin tried to not let me wear t shirts with words on them because it would emphasis my breasts! I was 12-13 and that’s not okay to make a child feel ashamed for having breasts. She proceeds to shush me and say not in the mall not here. She then essentially called me skanky because I sometimes post selfies and pictures that have cleavage in them. Why not since she felt comfortable criticizing my parenting in the middle of a store? I told her goodbye and left

"So about 6 years ago or so my parents got separated for the like 3rd time because their relationship was toxic (For those of you who watch supernatural, it’s like the episode where Bobby dies and it shows what his childhood was like. That was essentially my childhood except my dad made good money so we had a better looking house). So for the next year or so my mom is trying to convince my sister and I that my dad has changed and was going to change. Me and my sister knew better so we kept saying we didn’t want him around the house (strictly because he was so mean to our mom and us when they are together). So my dad goes to rehab and is going through hard strides to “make himself better” and he’s been sober ever since rehab. After he got out though our mom forced me to hang out with him (not my sister she was away at college and I was still in high school). My sister had voiced that she would never come home if he came back because of how toxic he is, so they never got back together. 

Fast forward about a year. My dad is dating someone and my mom is cutting everyone who hangs out with her out of her life. She says that her and my dad were exchanging emails about how they wanted to make things work and that she was receiving emails from him saying he still loved her during the start of my dads new relationship. My dad denies it and no one else knows anything about it. I kind of believe her because my dad is the kind of person to do that. Either he has selective memory or he’s a compulsive liar. My mom believes my dads girlfriend knew the whole time that he was trying to work things out with her so she’s cutting everyone involved with her out. I don’t think she knew about it because literally no one else knew. 

I hang out with my dad still because he’s teaching me how to make websites and do other graphic design related things because that’s what I plan to do in the future but I’m only hanging out with him for like 3 hours a week. It’s all I can bare. Every time I come home my mom throws a fit about me hanging out with “that bitch” even though I respond to conversations with her with minimal effort and try to avoid her at all costs. My mom accuses my sister and I of betraying her every time. My dad still isn’t a great person but he’s tolerable and his new girlfriend keeps him in line.

The forecast calls for rain and thunderstorms all 4 of those days and they do not want to back out or reschedule.

c1hm82	2019-06-17 01:27:51	paper_cones	AITA for adding someone on Overwatch to call them out?	"Personal context: I’m normally not the type to be toxic in online games but for some reason this time I chose to confront a stranger online about it. I try my best to stay neutral and be wholesome, even if it means getting called slurs and other “normal gaming” talk. I don’t believe that just because it’s normal in the community it should be left alone. I’ve had a couple run-ins with the usual toxic folks on Overwatch but I think this time was the last straw...that’s why this time I went after this dude.

This guy and another 3-stack decided to shit all over me and this other guy playing dps in quickplay. The guy I added was playing as a Moira telling us how many golds they got and how shit we were for not being able to get gold elims. In quickplay, no one really gives a shit nor plays a normal 2-2-2 or real comp so there’s really no reason to trash talk or blame anybody for being bad because we don’t know if they’re actually trying or not. But at the same time, it is annoying when you are trying to win but your teammates are obviously not very good. I never dps, only support. So when I do play dps, it’s in arcade or qp.

I added this Moira because they told me specifically “don’t play dps if you’re not going to do anything”. “You’re trash” and the usual angry nerd rage comments on Overwatch. After the match I added them and asked to play another round with them, egged them on about coaching me for dps if they were so willing to call me out on how shit I was. They refused and told me “learn the role then come back to me”. We went back and forth and I even jumped into a game with them because some dude left.

The game didn’t last because we were too busy typing. They then said “some people just can’t dps. Learn who you are”. I asked what about their own practice and if they just play new roles in training mode instead of ever trying quickplay. They said, “I have my own repertoire”.

I’m not sure what even to say, honestly.

c1hm0s	2019-06-17 01:27:15	yamadamn	AITA because I seemed inconvenienced by being roped into throwing a pop-up surprise party for a coworker's boyfriend?	"My (27f) coworker/friend (32f) throws her boyfriend (28m) a month and a half early surprise birthday party - Olympics themed, and pop-up style in a city park with no permit. I offer to design all the shirts and have an ironing party one night! It was great (she helps me out with this level of favour a fair amount). There were a few messed up shirts but I soaked them for 24+ hours and scraped them all by hand so they would look presentable.

Then because I have a car, she brings ALL of the party shirts, supplies, food, alcohol and decor to work. She will be with her partner as a distraction that morning, so I can just set up the party for all their friends I mostly don't know in the park on the day of. I will bring my little card table and a small cooler for 30 people. I am hesitant but was never directly asked if this was ok, so it becomes the plan.

I warned of difficulties loading my car on Friday downtown at work causing me about 45 extra minutes finding parking and missing part of our celebratory meeting. But as I headed out to walk to my parking spot and bring it around to one-hour parking I begin to get a guilt trip  about “well this is OBVIOUSLY an inconvenience for me so she will JUST pay 60$ for an uber.” I say no, it’s a little inconvenient but I don’t want her to spend more money—all good.  And I did act really flustered when I got to the celebratory meeting late, which was probably apparent.

So Saturday, my partner and I load up the car full of stuff without a permit and set up this party and hand out shirts to all these people by name tag (another 30-minute drive and 20-minute parking fiasco). People showing up before her keep questioning why it’s not just in someone’s backyard and why we didn’t do it at the picnic tables? Surprise party commences, goes ok except the whole no seating, not everyone loves group exercise thing. Alcohol helps!

She and I have fun chats all day, but I get pushy about packup a little at the end because they were going to a pub and I got stuck with all the stuff to bring back.

Now she is giving me the silent treatment because I seemed 'inconvenienced by the parking and setup' and we were” too into” the olympic games and competitive on the day. My partner is super athletic so we were working hard to win at the games she arranged.  (She was fussing at our other co-worker today for not participating and being active enough).

My partner is very diplomatic and said the only time I got a little sassy was at the time to pack up, when I asked if we could dump out some of the really heavy water jugs.  I also know I seemed stressed by the parking the week before, and that’s on me for being anxious when it’s just city driving. I tried to talk to her and explain why I might have seemed inconvenienced, sending multiple paragraphs apologising for any stress it caused. Now I’m getting one word answers to everything and we work very closely together.

After that I saw him twice, once 10 years ago and once last year ( Im 20 btw), he left the country and now has two kids with the woman he cheated on my mother with. I started talking more regularly to him a few months ago too, but it was weird because I sometimes feel like Im talking to a stranger, especially since we never really talked before.. The thing is: last time we saw eachother he invited me to join him and his family in their vacation this july. His children are fine but his wife is visibly trying really hard to stand me and once even made a bragging statement about how my father cheated with her, to my face.(this really made me cant stand her).  But I was really moved by his intention and I do get the vibe that he is actually trying so I said yes and we started planning according to my summer schedules. But now I feel like I hurried to make a decision and he planned a 3 week trip for me and his family which i dont know at all, his children speak a different language, he finds it hard to speak to me freely when his current wife is around cause she is jealous and I feel really awkward around them. I’d tell him I changed my mind but he already paid for everything and Im having huge anxiety about everything and I feel like 3 weeks is so much time and I want to tell him that I dont want to come anymore.

c1hlcv	2019-06-17 01:25:16	talksheep	AITA for leaving in the middle of the night?	Had a fantastic time with this guy I’ve been on and off with for two years. I’m 26F and he 47M. We were both getting restless after watching movies and hooking up in bed and decided to go for jog around the lake at his house. He was asking me questions on our walk and one of them was if I could be an animal what kind of animal would I be? I told him a dog because I love dogs. Then he proceeded to say that he would “fucking love to be one of Selena Gomez’s dogs so he could lick her asshole and vagina” all the time. He usually says dickhead things like this and I let it go because I’m always drunk when I’m with him so it makes it easier to put up with him, but I couldn’t let it go this time as I was completely sober. Anyway, I was quiet the rest of the walk and when we got back to his place I told him I was sorry for being quiet but that I was very annoyed by his graphic description of being a dog. I also brought up the time he told me about a girl he was having sex with and she got mad at him and started throwing all the sex toys off the balcony and the neighbors found it. And I reminded him of the time during Christmas where I gave him a toy train set to put around the Christmas tree only for him to tell me that he wanted to find me a boyfriend. I always knew we weren’t relationship material but there are some things I just don’t wanna know about. I told him that when he’s with me I don’t want to hear about other people he’s fucked, especially with graphic detail. Anyway, I was so annoyed last night that I packed up my stuff and left at midnight to go home after he tried to apologize for thirty min and said he would never say things like that again. He told me that I was hurting him by leaving and not staying but I honestly could not stand to be there anymore. I feel like a jerk because I told him how I couldn’t stand being there because I wasn’t drunk enough to put up with him. I texted him this morning to say I was sorry for the way I left but that I was so annoyed I couldn’t deal with being in that situation. He said he understood. Am I the asshole here? I feel bad.

It had been a very long day, I was really tired and I had ordered dinner from my favorite Mexican restaurant. I got home from work, changed into pjs, and put something stupid on tv some awaiting my dinners arrival. It comes, a feast of tacos - all fresh and hot. I sit down to eat and my BFF of 7 years calls. I send the call to vm as I really wanted to eat while my food was hot. I had  planned to text her after eating. 

Before tucking in, I snapped a pic of my tacos to post to FB (don't judge), I have a running joke about tacos with a couple of buddies, so I tagged them,put my phone down and ate.

After eating, I sent a text to my friend telling her i was sorry i missed her call - dinner had just arrived and i wanted to eat and could we talk tomorrow as i was exhausted and going to go to bed soon. And by missed the call, I  just meant that I  hadn't answered. I don't know how to say ignored the call without exactly saying that, which sounds rude.

Let me also say, I suffer from MS and a host of other autoimmune diseases so often after a 10 hour day of work, I really am exhausted and not up for much after work. 


I don't get a reply and I  head to bed. At about 10:30pm, I  get a notification that someone has shared a document with me - the noise was unusual and woke me up. I go to see what has been sent and it's a scathing letter, calling me a liar about missing the call, and how she didn't expect me to treat her like that - how could I engage my other friends on FB, but dismiss her call, etc. 

I was shocked and hurt by the letter. I honestly couldn't believe it. For me, the FB post was hardly engaging anyone - I posted it and logged off. It wasn't as if i was chatting at length with anyone. It was one sided and done in under a minute....

She and I used to talk close to daily and usually a few hours on the weekends. Now we have exchanged a few texts, a phone call or two, but it's never been the same. And I don't know how to fix it or if I  should. 

Was I really the asshole for not taking her call?

c1hjp0	2019-06-17 01:20:33	notactuallygod	AITA for pretending to be the voice of God?	"This week was the first anniversary of my Grandfather's passing. I was visiting home to mark the occasion, as was my sister. We slept in our childhood bedrooms, and because it's the middle of summer, it's hot as hell, so our windows were open. Our bedrooms look over the yard and a deep forest. The windows are close enough together that when we were kids we could lean out and talk without getting in trouble for staying up past bedtime, but far enough apart that there's a bathroom separating the rooms, for context. 

Last night, I woke up to a voice talking rapidly. I was disorientated, but recognised it as my sisters voice. I called out her name, and I heard her freak out and slam her window shut. I was exhausted, and fell asleep again without checking on her. This morning, she told our Mother she was praying for a sign our Grandfather was out there, and God called her name from the forest. We were raised to believe, but I'm agnostic, and she's claimed for years now to be an atheist. But today she claims she's had some kind of revelation and wants to go back to church. She also says she feels she's got her sign that our Grandfather is out there, and she feels at peace with his passing now. I asked if she was sure it was God's voice, hoping she'd realise it was definitely me, but she insisted she was certain because it was late enough no one was awake, she'd been asking for a sign, and the voice ""came from the woods"" where no one would have been- the house is in the middle of the country.

She's convinced it was God. I don't want her to go back to religion if she's going back based on a false experience. I support her decision to go back if she really wants to, but it wasn't God, it was me. But she's been struggling a lot with Grandfather's passing, and if this eases her grief maybe I shouldn't tell her? AITA if I let her have her ""sign"" from God?"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My boyfriend and I are 23 and 24 and we’ve been dating for 5 years. We also live together. Today I was at my parents for Father’s Day and just got home. Usually when I visit my parents I end up staying late but today I still have homework to finish so I had to get going early. 

I show up to our apartment much earlier than expected and I see my boyfriend looking guilty. Next to him I see a whippet tank and about 50 of those cartridges (unopened).

I don’t know what to do or how to feel. It makes me uncomfortable and I don’t want to see him do it. I have tried it in the past with an old friend but I only did it about 3 or 4 times and that was years ago. My boyfriend confessed that he’s been doing it recently with some friends.

c1hhsx	2019-06-17 01:15:05		AITA For not buying my GF food?	"Fair warning, there’s a lot of context for this:

I’ve been in a shit abuse cycle starting with my narc “mother,” and it led to a lot of shit friend decisions. An ex-GF I moved in with during my first time getting away from my parents led to her leeching about $2k from my savings. When I fled the state to a friend I thought I could trust, she ended up leeching $10k from apartment, child, vacation expenses, and then some, leaving me broken promises that I’d get the money back from a woman who prided herself a therapist but patted herself on the back for her best way to stop my anxiety was to growl at me, “Shut the fuck up” and think how triggering that can be given my life. I moved into a college dorm while continuing my degree and I thought from there that I was fine.

Now, I met a woman in a FB page that centered around LGBTQ+ people without supportive families. After 2 months of talking we started dating (Fair warning: she’s poly.) Given her job wasn’t giving the best hours, her fiancée constantly struggling with her barely functioning car to drive to our state to move in, & given how I still needed a place to stay after my dorm lease expired and wanted a better job than what I had at the time where I’d have weekly meltdowns from being overworked from most of my coworkers calling out... I kinda felt what was in front of me was my best opportunity.

I moved in three days ago.

Last night we realised that I really don’t know how to cook, so she offered to teach me but warned me that her OCD makes her a forceful teacher. I begin to say and I quote, “ I’d dealt with a very narcissistic cunt (my “mother) for 20 years, love, so—“

She cut me off, pissed, saying that she hated being related to a narc. My girlfriend has BPD which I completely understand is different from NPD — I took psych classes when getting my first degree, and I get she was offended, though could’ve been less harsh about it, but that’s not what gets me.

She said, “...You talk about her daily, and it’s annoying.”

I’m sorry, but WHAT?! Coming from a Military Vet who suffers from the more “typical” PTSD AND PTSD from familial abuse on a DAILY basis such as yourself, what right do you have to say about my trauma?! Most of the time I’m silent because that’s all I know what to do BECAUSE of my trauma, so how can I as a victim of abuse — which you seem to sympathize most of the time — be annoying to the point where you misconstrued my trauma as frequently needing excuses?!

...This morning my GF calls me and asked me to bring her food while she’s at work... because she has over $100 in overdraft fees currently because she doesn’t know how to budget and has her own problems of gigantic bills. When I told her no, she went silent and then proceeded to go silent on me for the rest of her shift.

My only concern is timing. I know investigations take time, and I am ok with that. I would hope if a complaint was made about me, a full investigation would happen. When I was making a statement, i was told that the person (D) would be told not to talk to me, and our schedules would be changed so that we didn't see each other. But the thing is, we never overlap. D is an opener, I am a closer. BUT: as a closer, I am frequently left in the building alone. As an opener, D has keys to the building. This was what caused the most recent issue. 


So why do I want to postpone? I believe tomorrow is when they are going to confront D. Tomorrow I close. There is nobody who closes with me who will be willing to stay until I'm done. Whereas Tuesday I have off, and Wednesday there are people closing with me, and Thursday I dont close, and Friday I am off. While I am somewhat concerned about D showing up again like last time, I am significantly more concerned about D showing up to confront me about reporting him. From their point of view, I know they want to deal with this whole thing as soon as possible, which is not a bad thing to me. Im just worried about dealing with anger or ""revenge"".

c1hfjk	2019-06-17 01:08:39	bakedBoredom	AITA for wanting limited contact with my dad?	"There’s a lot of context necessary for this, but I’m going to try to just keep it short. 

To start off, I live with my mom. My mom and dad got a divorce when I was 4, and my older brother and I were caught in the middle of a really long and intense custody battle. 

My dad did a lot of shady things. He tried to manipulate my brother and I into not wanting to live with my mom. 

My brother used to live with my dad (before he moved out) and I have lived with my mom. Before we were split like this, my brother was mad at my dad all the time and I never used to understand why. After hearing the stories from my mom, reading court documents, and analyzing all of my rare conversations with my dad, I’ve come to believe that he isn’t someone I want to actively try to have a relationship with. 

It seems like he doesn’t care about me. He uses the idea of me to seem like a better person. For example, the last time I was with him was at his friends house. They were talking about their daughters boyfriends, and my dad joined in on the “I hate all of my daughters boyfriends” joke. 

Except earlier that day, I mentioned a date I’d been on recently and he didn’t care. He made some joke and moved on. 

He doesn’t know anything about me. He doesn’t understand my interests and he doesn’t respect any of the hard work I put into my education. Then he turns around and acts like I’m the one that’s ignoring him, and acting disinterested when he calls. 

I went to my great aunts funeral on my moms side the other day. My dad went early because he claimed that she made her feel welcome in the family early in my parents marriage, but he didn’t want to bother anyone. 

Afterwards, my mom and I were in the city and had free time (it’s like an hour long drive from my house and is a big city, and also happens to be where my dad lives) and she suggested visiting my dad. I declined, because I just don’t want to talk to him. 

Later on, on the drive home, she said she felt sorry that he was so lonely, with my brother moved out and all. She said it haltingly, so I understand that she was more referring to me not wanting to talk to him anymore. She didn’t say it explicitly until today though. 

I didn’t call my dad until later on today to wish him happy Father’s Day because he has work. For the record, I did call him. Just not super early in the day. When my mom asked if I called, I told her no. She said that it was heinous to ignore him on Father’s Day. 

I was going to call him at 6:30. She asked at 5. 

I didn’t want to fight her so I didn’t reply. We didn’t get into a fight, luckily, and we’re okay but I was wondering:

c1hff4	2019-06-17 01:08:16	dowrotessera	AITA for wanting to end my friendship	"My friend and I met on Myspace. We got to be best of friends and two years later we started a long distance relationship. We had met up over the years and we both were in love. I'm not a believer at one time she wasn't either but pressure from her family brought her back. I didn't care, it was a part of who she was. It hadn't been an issue on either side.

A few years ago I went to Ireland and met extended family there. Everything was beautiful, I felt at peace and did some soul searching. I loved this woman more than anything else in the world so I bought a ring and planned to propose when I got home. 

I had been keeping up with her during the trip with nothing seeming off. When I got back to the States, I messaged her saying I got back safely and had a surprise for her. She replied back with that until I got right with god, we couldn't talk anymore. I was devastated. I decided to honor her wishes. 

Christmas comes around about six months later. I was a bit of a drunken mess. Seeing me miserable, my brother convinced me to wish her a Merry Christmas. The two of them got me sobered up and we started having a good time. That evening she replied back. 

Come to find out that her paster used her fear of family rejection and turned it to a fear of hell. Then fed her a story that if she left me that I'd become a Christian. He started filling her head about how I wouldn't be a good father, that I would raise them wrong and. That I would lead her to a path of hell. We had talked about this before I left for the trip and I assured her that her beliefs weren't an issue, I loved her how she was.

We kind of go at it. She repeated what her pastor told her about me going to hell and I ended it with me not wanting to talk anymore unless she can find a faith that would let us be happy.

About two years passed and it's getting easier but I'm still not over it. My brother didn't like me unhappy and, knowing I was still in love with her, messaged her on Facebook and gave her my number. 

She called and we talked. She had been having a hard time with everything too. We decided to be friends again. Everything seemed to be sliding back to how it had been before I left on my trip. She stayed with me for a week and we went back to the I love yous. We even talked about her moving in.

She started bringing up the topics of marriage and kids and how they would be raised. She wanted the wedding in a church, the kids raised in the church, and I was fine with it. She was fine with it.

I take her back home and her relatives go on with her associating with me. So we went back to ""just friends"" again since ""different yokes can't wed"". 

I love this woman but I'm not sure how much more I can take. We constantly start slipping back into our old comfort but I have to be the one to remind us both that we have to stop. She doesn't want to ""fall out of God's favor.""

c1hf96	2019-06-17 01:07:50		AITA For telling my wife to get a job	"Throw away account so this can’t be traced to me but here goes.

I’m an immigration lawyer and I work with families or individuals that want to live and work in America. I work mainly with South American’s and heavily with Mexican families. 

My job has always been difficult but with all the press surging the southern border, and a recent negative article about one of my clients in my local news paper; I’ve been stressed. Very stressed and very tired. I work from about 4am-8pm Monday to Friday and it never really slows down.

My wife is a stay at home mom. She kicks ass. She does so much and our kids are obsessed with her! We do okay financially and she likes that. She’s extremely proud of what I do and always talks about my work to anyone that will listen - however she also thinks I work way too much and that  I need more time with my family. I understand this, and no one wants it more than me but it’s just impossible if I want to stay with this work. She recently has said we should buy some land and just live in a ranch and work modest jobs.

It kind of irritates me because how do you just up and move? And she never would anyway she lives a very stable life and enjoys it. Besides, I know she’d miss the money I bring in if I suddenly became a shop keeper. The other day she was talking about it again and I snapped a little and said I didn’t think it was realistic and she said it is, that the only thing stopping us is us. So I said well she’ll have to work too - without this job I couldn’t hold us together financially by myself. She argued that she’d have to look after the kids and I said that it sounds like she just wants a geographical upgrade and said she’d have to work too if we were going to do this. 

She accused me of calling her a gold digger and said I don’t understand how much she does and the sacrifices she made and now she’s mad at me and I really feel like I was reasonable. I have all the respect for her day-to-day but I find how easy she thinks it would be a little disrespectful to how hard I’ve worked to attain this life for us."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1hds4	2019-06-17 01:03:24	cherry-mack	AITA for being uncomfortable and angry about the budding relationship between my gay male roommate and my straight male friend/budding love interest?	"My roommate (let's call him Dave (M 29) and I (F 24) have a good relationship, he's one of my closest friends and vice versa. 

Recently, an old friend re-connected with me (let's call him John). Dave and I live in a high rise and John just began working in a store at the bottom of the building. 

On Friday, John expressed an interest in dating me.  I was kind of interested in dating John too, but he's currently homeless/couch surfing, and I was a bit worried about being used as a free/convenient place to stay (John's behavior has heavily hinted at wanting to move into my apartment). 

I invited John over one evening around 8. Work kept him late, and he wasn't able to come over until after Midnight. I was a bit annoyed at him wanting to still come over at the late hour, but he begged to hang out for just half an hour or so until I went to bed. 

Long story short, after I went to bed, John stayed up with Dave. They hooked up, and John spent the night. After John had left, Dave excitedly told me about them hooking up. I didn't know how to react and made up some excuse to avoid the conversation. 

John spent nearly the entire weekend with Dave. They are clearly ""together"" now. John has basically taken to avoiding me/acting very awkwardly towards me.

I'm kind of angry about the whole situation because:
1. I know I never told John I was interested in dating him, but he expressed interest in me, I've been figuring out my interest in him as we've been hanging out, and we never got to have a real discussion about it.
2. John and I have spoken about sexuality before. He has always told me he was straight. I feel like he began sleeping with my male roommate mostly for a place to sleep. 
3. I feel completely left out of my friendship with my roommate and my friendship with John. They treat me like the third wheel and act like I'm invading their space when I hang out with them in common areas.
4. Dave is in a relationship with another (lovely) person, and his sleeping with John feels kind of fucked up to me. 

My friends tell me I'm being homophobic/an asshole and that's why I'm so uncomfortable. I identify as queer/bisexual and I know it's totally possible for an LGBTQ person to be homophobic, but I really don't feel like me being upset about this situation is me being homophobic/an asshole.

Just to add a bit more information. On Friday 6/14 John was supposed to come over so we could discuss the possibility of dating/hang out in a more intimate setting and see if we were really compatible. But because of the late hour/with Dave being home, we ended up hanging out with Dave instead. Friday night after I went to bed, John hooked up with Dave. We never even got to discuss the possibility of a relationship before he hooked up with my roommate. And it makes me feel that his interest in me wasn't at all genuine.

Edit: John was not in an open relationship when this whole thing began, but I don't know what conversations he's had with his partner. And I decided none of this is worth it. Not angry anymore, but also not interested in continuing a friendship with John. Even if I am the asshole here, his behavior has been kind of skeevy. I'm also going to tell Dave, I'm uncomfortable with him having guests spend more than 2 nights a week here. He has a boyfriend who regularly stays a night or two as well. So hopefully that means seeing less of John."	No A-holes here	0	0	112.0	24.0	0.0	0.0
c1hcn0	2019-06-17 01:00:06	its_just_Haze	AITA for kicking my brother out of home?	"I feel like I know the answer but hear me out. My brother (we'll call him Colm) has an issue with drinking. He's been kicked out of his girlfriend's house, she just had his second kid. I'm living in my Mam's house, which is five minutes walk from Colm's family. For the past year he's been living in my dad's house. Due to his behavior over the drinking and drugs  he's not only been kicked out of his girlfriend's but also my Mam's house so his last resort was dad's, which is rough I won't lie. The house isn't very nice, they both are kind of just drinking and living in filth. 

I've tried everything with my brother but you have to understand that years of addiction takes its toll on not just the individual but also everyone around them. Colm has stolen all my anxiety medication right before my final year college exams, resulting in me missing all six of them because I couldn't control the panic attacks and didn't have enough money to go to the doctor again. Which I'm still kind ofnpissed off at.  I worried he's going to affect my repeats because the house is tough when he's here. 

I know he just wants to be in a house that's clean, with good food and also close to his family. But he's an asshole on drink and has no respect for the house. 

I just got a scholarship for a Master's and this is a once in a life time opportunity, that I've worked really hard for. This is my ticket out of here. If I don't pass these August exams no scholarship. So I need to stay calm so I don't fuck up again with the panic attacks.

My Mam's on holiday for a week and Colm just arrived with a gear bag, all his Washing and says he's staying for awhile. He's smoking joints in the kitchen, having cans and cooking food and it's like almost 2am. 

I made him dinner, washed his clothes, made him a lunch and prepped his breakfast. Its cool for tonight. 

But..
I want to tell him to fuck off because he's fucked me over enough and I do enough for him but I think he's trying to manipulate me and make me feel guilty so I let him stay.  Am I being a bad sister here?

I made pot roast for me and my daughter and he cooked his steak the way he likes it which is medium rare/rare (still very red with myoglobin coming out). I have no problems with eating different meals since he says my pot roast is too dry for his liking and he cooked the steak himself. The problem is we have a 17 month daughter who wants to eat everything her dad eats. 

I've asked him before to not feed her steak that rare and he does it anyway. Today was no exception and I firmly expressed to him how it makes me anxious giving her meat that's still red. He says I'm being overprotective and that our daughter is fine. He seems annoyed that I bring this up again. He finds pieces around the edge (which is more cooked but is higher in salt but that's another issue) and continues to give her pieces.

It makes me so upset that I leave the table. I come back a bit more level headed and tell him about problems with food poisoning, e coli, salmonella, worms and a whole slew of reasons why it's a bad idea. I tell him it's fine for adults but not appropriate for toddlers. He said fine and said he won't feed it to her anymore, begrudgingly. I thought this was the end of the conversation.

Later in the night he calls his parents and brings up what happened. They are on his side and think nothing of giving a toddler rare meat because as they say ""it's delicious."" I don't disagree about the latter, I enjoy medium rare steaks too but I think it's not right to give to someone so young.

Am I being overprotective and making a big deal out of it? I feel like he's being a jerk for disregarding my position. I'm just tired of having the same argument whenever he has steak. And I don't want to do anything to put my daughter's health in jeopardy."	Asshole	0	0	36.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

It's the nicest car either of us has ever had and I want to keep it that way. We made a drive that takes a few hours today and about halfway through, while I was driving, I realized we were dangerously low on gas. Our car's gas tank is pretty small so running out sneaks up on you quickly. 

&#x200B;

I asked for directions to the nearest gas station and my partner tells me to go to a service stop a few minutes ahead. Those don't normally have gas pumps in the area we were in, but I trusted that they checked the map. We pull in and there's no gas, and now we only have probably 1 gallon of gas or less left in the car. I'm already upset that we're running on fumes and then my partner kept taunting me saying that the car would be fine and I was stupid for saying it was their mistake that we were at this pointless service center. I thought it was reasonable to expect anyone with a smartphone (my partner is 20 and has an iPhone) would use a map to check for gas in an urgent situation!

&#x200B;

I get back on the road and ask for directions to a real gas station and I'm told to ""drive straight."" I ask what exit I'm supposed to take and partner doesn't give any kind of direct answer. I know my partner thinks I'm not great at following directions and would rather just tell me where to turn in the moment, but this is an urgent situation and I want to make sure we get there. I keep asking and they keep telling me to go straight until I end up driving past the station. I admit I freaked out a little bit here, but the fuel meter was below the very bottom line! We were literally out of gas! I finally got some real directions from them and after some backtracking we made it to the gas station where my partner insisted I pump the gas even though I was really flustered. 

&#x200B;

I was really mad after this and tried to confront them about what had just happened. They blew up in my face and said I was acting crazy when the gas tank got low. Their defense for letting me miss the turn into the gas station was that I was ""distracting them by arguing."" TIL frantically asking for directions is arguing... 

&#x200B;

My phone is the only one that controls the bluetooth in the car and the radio was off. I was extremely upset and meditative silence helps me calm down so I just kept the car silent for the rest of the drive and followed the map on my phone (with no issues).

"So my older sister is 24, and since she was about 19, has worked with people on the autism spectrum. I myself have very minor Aspergers, and she acts like the stuff she learned applies to me as well. 

We had gone to a grocery store and on the way back, she was telling me how the film Inside Out is great for autistic people, and how I should watch it because of this. I’ve told her repeatedly how I don’t like for her to bring up my condition with me or others. She’s never respected this, I have her on audio telling others about how the reason she got into her field is that her younger brother is on the spectrum. 

So after she mentions the film, I ask her why it would apply to me. She then goes on to say that it would help me express my emotions more clearly. I explain to her that I’ve never had an issue with people understanding how I feel. She then goes on to say that I do have trouble with this, as that’s was autistic people have. 

I’m naturally offended by this, and I told her that just because I’m on the spectrum, it doesn’t mean that I have the same issues that others on the spectrum do. I ended my message by telling her that just because she has a degree, that doesn’t mean she knows everything about every autistic person. 

She then flips out and calls me an asshole and a smartass, I tell her that I’ve asked her nicely multiple times to just treat me like a normal person and to not mention anything about autism or my Aspergers, and every time she’s said yes and never respect my wishes. She then says that nobody actually cares about what I talk about and that because of my autism I’ve never noticed. She then goes and tells me that no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be able to not be this way. 

When we got home, I went to my room and just cried for so long, and almost had a full breakdown, I had always been told that I was very independent and emotionally clear for someone on the spectrum, and to have her, a person with work experience and a degree, tell me I’m no different, just caused me to question all this.

c1h6b4	2019-06-17 00:41:48		WIBTA if I refused to pay more for the hotel room?	"My best friend is getting married next year. Her wedding party is spread out all over the place (her maid of honor isn’t even in the same state and neither am I-one of the bridesmaids, only one the bridesmaids actually is in the same state), as are her parents, so she’s had realistic expectations. Our other friend (maid of honor) and I asked her early on what she wanted to do for her bachelorette weekend. Originally, she said something in NY, which is actually close to be. Selfishly, I was happy because it’d be cheaper for me.

A little bit ago, that changed and she decided on California. That’s across the country for everyone in the bridal party, including her and the bridesmaid that live in the same state. Now, I get being in a wedding party, expenses add up, and I knew that when I signed up for it. However, then she was debating on something in Florida (her state) which would’ve been a lot cheaper. However, ultimately, she landed back on California. She also chose a holiday weekend, so it’d be even more expensive. I didn’t complain, though, because it was her choice and I wasn’t even mad, really. What was, frustrating, however is that this is about 3 months before her wedding and it might have made more sense (and be cheaper) for us to all just come a day or so early to do something in her state. But I didn’t say that. All of the bridesmaids and maid of honor agreed to come to California. Best friend texted us all the cost of the hotel room we’re splitting and told us the dates so we could book flights. I paid her as soon as I could and got my tickets a few weeks ago.

Tonight, however, she texted me and maid of honor that a different bridesmaid isn’t sure if she can come to California (didn’t state why). She said that price of hotel is going up if that’s the case. Maid of honor hasn’t paid her yet, so she said she’ll let her know the new total and I can just cash app her the difference. I asked how much it was. It was another couple hundred. Now, this is only if said bridesmaid can’t come and we won’t know for a bit, but I just don’t know if I want to sink more money into this trip.

c1h5q1	2019-06-17 00:40:06		AITA for inviting my dad to go to the casino knowing he had no money then not splitting the winnings with him and offering to go get a steak and lobster dinner instead	since its Father's Day I felt obligated to ask my dad to do something, (quick summary back story, we're not super close never have been he was a mess 90 percent of my life and never around and now lives 40 mins away and I just occasionally see him but talk almost every day on the phone lately) anyways I suggested the casino knowing he had no money I joked that whatever I gave him to gamble with if he won he'd have to pay double back. so we're in there for about 45 mins and have a decent winning streak for the relatively small bets, like 10 -20 $ CAD. we ended up getting up about $300 on different stubs and chips at which point I stopped at a vendor and combined it all back into cash before continuing on, after I got the cash in my hand I went to put it in my pocket but my dad had his hand out for some even tho we weren't really keeping track of who bet what but if I had to argue about I was the one who won the majority of it and he lost more then he won, and besides when I won the biggest jackpot on the one machine, ( like 180) I said we were both gonna go get steak and lobster dinner after. but I guess that wasn't good enough for him and once he saw the lady hand me 300 bucks he wanted some and when I said again that we'll just go for steak dinner he got all upset and said he didn't like my attitude then walked home.

c1h51q	2019-06-17 00:38:03	VileCastle	AITA for going against family wishes and not reminding a dementia resident about their circumstances?	"I'm a PCA that gives medications at a nursing home. 
I mainly work in the dementia ward and I love it.  I love the different personalities and the one on one's, the group activities and just the atmosphere. You'll love it or hate it.  

The general rule for the dementia wing is to keep everyone calm and happy and that can mean telling some white lies. 

One particular resident is constantly imagining scenerarios that his family needs him and that his mother and wife are still alive from time to time. 
Nothing new but this man's particular family is sick of telling him again and again about his situation and have asked us to reinforce his actual situation which leaves him heartbroken and angry. 

My choice is valued by some and frowned upon by other staff. 

I go against these wishes for a number of reasons.

1- he will always forget anyway and creating a fake reason leaves him feeling better and not fretting.  
(I say he's staying with us for a couple of nights to make sure he's fit enough soon to go back home to his family and wife and nothing is urgent for him to be there) 

2- when we tell him,  he gets upset and angry,  forgets the reason behind it and gets frustrated and aggressive because he can't remember why) 

3- he tries to break out of the flywire windows if the doors aren't locked to get out and walk a couple towns over to his home. (he used to before we started locking doors) 

I know I'm in the wrong in some ways by going against the wishes of the direct family but his behavior, like everyone else's, is much much better. 

My choice in doing this is because of his first and foremost and everyone else's safety. 

Also not a throw away account, I risk my karma for fair but firm judgement.


Also to note, my bosses in private and direct nurses agree with my opinion. I've  also told the family of my reasoning even if they disagree or don't understand."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1558.0	183.0	0.0	0.0

But a couple of days ago, I accidentally left the door open and he ran outside before I could stop him. I ran after him but wasn't able to catch him. I  spent a couple of hours trying to find him before I gave up, hoping he would come back on his own. He did, the next day. But he had blood on his fur and some wounds. Clearly, he had been in a fight with or was attacked by another cat, a dog, or a wild animal. 

I was scared for his life and didn't want to just let him suffer, so I took him to the vet. I knew I was broke and couldn't pay, but I couldn't just do nothing. Anyway, the vet treated him, and the bill was too big for me to pay, as I knew it would be. They told me that I couldn't have him back until I paid at least half of the bill (they would let me make payments for the rest). Fair enough, I figured this would happen and I'm not upset at them; I understand that it is a business. 

I am not sure if I will be able to save enough money to get him back before they decide to give him away. I will try though. I might also be able to get my family to give (or at least loan) me the money to do it.

Anyway, am I the asshole for taking my injured cat to the vet even though I knew I couldn't pay them up front or possibly at all? 

I also want to make it clear that I don't think the vet is an asshole for keeping my cat unless I pay them. So the most I am hoping for is NAH."	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c1h35s	2019-06-17 00:32:32	jennscot	AITA for refusing to let my sister sleep in my room and make her sleep on the sofa instead?	"Ok so a bit of context- I (21F) spend my time split between my mom and dads house mainly for work (dads) and dog time (moms). I come down to my moms on Sunday nights and go back during the week when I need to work, I’m an absolutely massive mommy’s girl, so I need me some mommy time, and it’s where our two dogs, my cat and my brother live as well, so it’s nice to see everyone (my parents are amicably split as well). 
My younger sister (20) and I both moved out last year for college, her to the other side of the (small) country, and me to our dads. 
Her lease was up this week and she enlisted my mom to help move her back home, however my uncle has been staying and has been using my sisters room to sleep in (he’s approx. 70 so the sofa isn’t a good idea). I’m never here at weekends so my sister was using my room- something I don’t mind one bit. 
My mom tried to convince me to come down later during the week when my uncle leaves so neither of us would be out of a bed, however it makes it more expensive to travel during the week, as on Sundays I travel home with my mum, and it saves me a good £15/20 each time, so I said I was happy to sleep on the sofa until Tuesday with the expectation that my sister does not treat my room like her own room. 
I say this, because she likes to eat in her room (specifically in bed under the covers), and isn’t the cleanest of people, as she likes to spend the entire day in bed multiple days in a row if she can and is quite slobby. 
She knows how disgusted I am by the fact she eats in her room. I will not even drink in my room unless it’s from a bottle. 
I’m the complete opposite, I’ve eaten in my room once in the eight years we’ve lived there, have a slight issue with things being in their rightful order too so that means no eating in my room! ESPECIALLY not in bed!!
Today I found out that she’s been eating in my bed, there’s crumbs all over my bed, and hasn’t even bothered to clean up after herself, with food packets all over the room, despite the fact I have a bin. I’m furious, disgusted and revoked her right to sleep in my room immediately and told her to sleep on the couch, or bunk in with our mom. She did exactly that until my mom went to bed and she got annoyed that my mom also expected to sleep in her own room too, despite that being the agreement all along. 

She screamed at me and told me I’m a lying c**t for saying I’d ever have slept on the couch in the first place and to get out of her sight, so I’m in my room, I’ve had to change the bedsheets, clean up after her mess completely and throw out all the rubbish she collected in the two nights she’s been in my room, but I’m still itching at the fact there’s been food in my room and can’t concentrate properly.

I moved away primarily for school and so when I'm not in class I'm working. Anyway, I'll be there for the weekend and then it's back to work. He and I have been close friends for the past 10 years, and we really don't get to hang out very much since I moved. I was hoping to get together and hang out together, and instead he invited me to his boyfriend's birthday party. His BF is the kind of guy that's always around him. Whenever they're together, he barely says anything to anyone else and just kind of is there. I don't think I dislike his boyfriend, I just feel like he doesn't try to engage with me or anyone else and it feels exhausting trying to have a conversation with someone who doesn't ask me questions or care about anything happening in my life.

&#x200B;

Anyway, so I told my friend that I'd come by and hang out but quite honestly I'm dreading it a little bit, especially since he said that he will be busy bar tending during the party and I know how he gets, so I know he won't be able to talk much when he's focused. I just can't help the feeling that I'm being used as a human decoration, being invited to a party with people I don't know and frankly am not that interested in meeting, honoring someone who hasn't gotten to know me and doesn't care to, and being around people I don't know, while the person I *do* know and want to hang out with won't be able to talk to me very much and catch up. I feel bad for being upset about this and I'm probably going to make some excuse to not go. Am I the asshole in this scenario?

c1h0bn	2019-06-17 00:24:29		WIBTA if I told my boyfriend I don’t want him to get a tattoo?	"My bf (23M) and I (22F) have been dating for almost two years now. I come from a pretty traditional/religious family and they are not a fan of tattoos, mostly my mom is against them and she’s head huncho of the family. I think tattoos are really cool and I totally get why people get them (it’s like an art piece on your body!) but I personally would never get one. I’m way too indecisive and the thought of something permanently on my skin kind of freaks me out, but to each they’re own.

So my mom is an awesome mom/lady but she does have very traditional views and values, tattoos are not okay for her. She’s only met my bf twice (bc we started dating midway through college and I was far away) and she already doesn’t like him too much because of a bad first impression (nothing major but it happens). I love him so much and he’s definitely husband material so we’re trying to work on their relationship and I really want her to like him. With time I know it’ll definitely work out once she starts to get to know him more, until he told me he wanted to get a tattoo. 

When he told me at first I didn’t mind because he has mentioned his desire for a tattoo before. In the past he told me several Ike’s he always wanted a small yin yang symbol somewhere under his armpit, so I thought no biggie my mom won’t really see that and it’s just a harmless yin yang sign so she’d get over it if she did. 

But then he said he now wants a grim reaper on his shoulder. I have no idea where this grim reaper idea came from bc it’s a little out of character for him. I know I can’t be the one to judge that because it’s his body and he has the right to get what he wants. But I also know it would be impossible to hide and my mom would see it and it would destroy any chance of her accepting him. I know that sounds super ridiculous and fucked up from my moms end (she’s definitely an asshole in this situation) but it’s hard to explain to anyone who doesn’t come from a traditional family. It’s just how they are. 

It also concerns me because this grim reaper idea came from nowhere and his own mom isn’t happy about it. I asked him if it was really what he wanted and he said if he doesn’t like it later he can always remove it, which concerned me more. That takes so much time and money and I don’t think he should be getting a tattoo with the mindset of “oh I can just get rid of it later”. If he really really wanted it I wouldn’t dare say anything but I feel like he’s just doing it without enough thought. But again, I’m not the type of person who would get a tattoo so I’m not sure if what I think is the right mindset is right. 

I haven’t said anything about it yet, but he made an appointment for July 22nd. I feel like I can’t let him do this without saying anything but I feel like an asshole if I tell him not to get it just because I don’t like it and my mom won’t like it. Am I the asshole if I tell him I don’t want him to get that tattoo? People with tattoos help me out!"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1gze6	2019-06-17 00:21:36	Meagster97	AITA For not reciprocating the same amount of affection that my parents give me?	"So I (18M) am the only kid in my family and I have very protective and conservative parents from an Asian background. The stereotypes of Asian parents being very strict definitely applies to me. However, I can feel that my parents truly do love me, its just the fact that I don't enjoy their way of showing it.

My mum has always treated me like I'm still a kid by still doing things like asking me to sleep in the same bed with her while hugging/snuggling, wanting me to kiss her on the cheek in public a lot, tickling me as a joke and stuff like those. My dad is actually very reserved but due to my mum's insistence he is also doing the same things (asking for pecks on the cheek, lots of hugs). They are very 'touchy' in showing affection and sometimes it feels uncomfortable.

They also expect me to put them above everyone else due to them being my parents. My mum would get mad if I don't call her everyday (I've lived abroad away from them for uni) and also if I am online on WhatsApp texting my friend but not texting them. They always say things like 'How come you can call and text your friends everyday but not your parents' and would get really angry and sometimes even cry.

Putting them above everyone else can get really overwhelming for me, especially if I'm present with them. I'm going back home in a couple weeks and they already planned vacations for me to go with them, not asking how I feel about it. Even before I left for uni everytime I ask to go out with my friends they would say things like 'You always go out with your friends but not us. We also want to be around our only son after we sacrificed so much for you'.

I know that they love me very much, and that they are willing to do anything for me. My dad got laid off from his job and they were willing to sell their car and take out thousands of euros in loans to pay for my university tuition, and its true that they sacrificed a lot for me. But sometimes they use this as a weapon and it just feels very overwhelming for me as oftentimes I want to be my own self and not have them breathing down my neck everytime.

Sometimes I just want to tell them to please back off and let me be.

&#x200B;

I don't know how to add all the details within a 3,000-word limit so sorry if this seems messy. To make a long story short, I had a girl that used to torment me from Elementary up until the summer before our 10th-grade year, when she finally became uninterested in me and left me alone. The bullying was super bad, and I considered ending my life at one point, so the scars are deep even to this day. I had a super close relationship with BB that started in 9th grade when we were sat next to each other in a class. That all came to a head when one day he asked if I would be his girlfriend, but told me not to tell anyone. His reasoning? (and these were his exact words) ""you have a really pretty face, like the prettiest I've ever seen but you're kinda fat, and I don't want anyone to know I like a fat girl."" Those are not the words an already super insecure 9th-grade girl needed to hear, and so we stopped talking, all without an apology from him to this day. The problem began when he came into my job this summer, and asked me out on a date (he came in for an unrelated reason). I had been pretending not to know who he was to save myself from having to converse with him, but I guess he recognized me anyway. I was livid, even after asking him if he remembered what he said to me in 9th grade and getting a ""yes"" back, he still refused to apologize. Now the real problem lies with my friends; when I told them what happened, there was an immediate divide. My university friends thought I was being a bitch for rejecting him for something he said as a kid (even after telling them he refused to apologize). While my old friends who were there during the bullying days told me, I did nothing wrong, and he doesn't deserve a chance, especially since he won't apologize. I only have three old friends, so the opinions of my university friends got to me, and I agreed to go on a date with him. It wasn't too bad, it was easy to see why we had become such close friends in the first place, but I couldn't get his sister or 9th grade out of my mind, so I made up and excuse and left. You can probably guess what my friends had to say about this, it's been about two weeks and some of them are still upset about the situation. The divide in opinions is making this all very confusing.

&#x200B;

My wife and I bought our very own little puppy last Thursday- a tiny little 8 week old Boston Terrier/Pug mix called Wally (our daughter picked the name after ""Wall-e"", one of her favourite movies of all time). He's adorable. I melted when I saw him. Anyway, this puppy shop was way out in the sticks, so my wife drove out there with our daughter while I was at work. Whilst my wife and I were deliberating the decision, my wife & daughter were parked in the parking lot, sitting in the car. Out of nowhere, this old lady runs into the back of our car. No major dents or anything, just a tiny dent mark and some scratches. My wife and this lady exchange details, and this lady 100% owns up to it. It was her fault, she was preoccupied. ""I had something on my mind"". Asks if we wouldn't mind NOT claiming it through insurance, and instead her just paying to get it fixed. My wife and I discuss, and that seems like a fine resolution. (Context: a similar thing happened last year with the exact same car before we bought it off my parents; the guy who hit it had a panel-beater for a brother, they fixed the bumper and repainted it in their garage- you wouldn't have known). 

&#x200B;

This morning, my wife took our car to our family mechanic. This guy is one of the nicest people I know. My dad's been taking our family cars to him since before I was born (25yo). My wife and I take our car to him for services, and he lets us pay for the service whenever we can afford to (has been 3-4 months in the past). Seriously, nicest person ever. I trust his judgement completely. He quotes $700 to fix the bumper, because they will need to replace & repaint the whole thing. Now I'm not feeling great about getting this nice old lady to pay $700 to fix our car over such minor damage. My wife agrees, but also thinks (rightly so) that when we eventually try to sell this car, we'll probably have to pay to get it fixed ourselves, so it's fair to get her to pay.

"My aunt has been getting on my nerves more and more recently. She is a moocher. She's in her 40s and has a master's degree, but still begs and manipulates my grandparents for money all the time. I've seen her planning trips where she starts saying stuff like ""oh this hotel is so run down, I don't think we'd be comfortable etc"" until my grandma offers to pay for a more expensive one then she literally looked at my cousins and said ""cha ching""

My grandma recently was talking to me about how she wanted to renovate her home, but couldn't because she'd given them thousands of dollars for their home renovations. Ever since her kids were born whatever hobby they've gotten into my grandparents have paid for it. They get into archery, my grandma buys the bows and arrows. They get into football, my grandma buys the ball and gear. They get into ultimate frisbee, my grandma buys the frisbee. She constantly acts like they're poor, but my aunt buys expensive muffins and coffee every morning and chooses to stay in a fun part time job that she's overqualified for despite having a master's degree.

I know my grandma is a grown woman and can make her own decisions with her money, but even as a broke college student I'd only go to my grandparents for money if I was absolutely desperate and I would be so embarrassed.

So now that I've explained my personal grudges against her here's what happened:

So around Christmas I noticed my cousins were beginning to adopt the same problem. They didn't seem to care about my grandparents for anything except their money. When one cousin opened his present and got a drone he started complaining that it wasn't good enough and guilted them hard over it to the point where they were talking about getting him a better one. I subtly called him out for it and he just said ""they have plenty of money, it's fine!"" and my other cousin got her first phone and started complaining that it was the 4s and was too old.

So later that day I decided to try to tell them that their mom doesn't treat our grandparents well and they aren't either. I did get a bit harsh with it and tell them they were acting like assholes and called my aunt a bitch. I was just so angry and defensive, I probably should've been more rational. My cousins got really mad at me and we ended up shouting at each other and they left.

Anyway my aunt found out what I said about her and now I started drama in my family. Some people are on my side, some are on her side and some of them won't talk to me anymore. I really didn't want this to happen, I just felt like if I didn't call it out it would just continue and worsen, but it also wasn't my place and I recognize that.

I don’t think I was ever addicted, but it got to the point where I would do it at least once a week, sometimes multiple times in a day. After February, it got down to once a month, and the last time I did it was in March. 

My friend moved away recently, and as a result we only see each other a few times per year. When she came to visit during Christmas, she asked if we could try coke (she’s never done it before), and I said yes. I ended up not being able to get a hold of my dealer so that plan fell apart. I told her that next time she visited we could do some together.

The last time I did it, I didn’t finish off my supply, and I’ve been saving it. Every time we call/text about our summer plans, she mentions doing drugs with me. Initially I was okay with it.

But now, I honestly have no desire to do coke (or any drug for that matter). I really don’t want to throw my future away over something so dumb, and I’ve almost been caught with drugs on me multiple times. 

However, she seems so excited to try it (along with other things), and I’ve kinda just been leading her on and saying how fun it’ll be. I’m scared to tell her because I feel like she’s got such high expectations for this summer because of me, and I think she’d be really mad if I said no.

c1gsli	2019-06-17 00:02:29	captianrobotpants	Aita for calling my dad out for outing too much pressure on my brother	"TLDR at the bottom 

So I went to my little brothers baseball scrimmage today. It was going good and I was having a good time with my family until the game started. Once the game started I realized my dad got into it a lot. I can understand why he works all the time (he goes into work around 4 so he wakes up around 2 am and doesn’t get home until 3pm) so the time he has to himself he spends watching my 3 brothers play ball. The brother I’m talking about is an extremely fit 12 year old who has a promising future in sports if he wants to stick with it

At first it wasn’t too bad just yelling and jumping and slapping fences loudly. at one point a kid dropped the ball causing the other team to score which lead to  him saying “ I’d run his guts out tomorrow at practice”. It wouldnt be a big deal to me but this is a team of 12 year olds. He also would loudly express his displeasure with the way the team was doing, in way the entire park could hear. I let my dad know multiple times that he was acting too excited 

Later on he starts back up and start yelling at the umpire, and I can tell that it is affecting my brother. My brother eventually got all up set and did some thing he shouldn’t have causing him to be ejected. My dad agreed with the umpire and was equally upset with my brother as he was.  

Flash forward we get to the house, I drove my brother home and we talked. I bring up the isssues I had with him, telling him he is putting too much pressure on my brother and he’s not getting treatdlike a kid, and that my brother feels like they don’t see him as anything but an athlete and not a person 

I feel bad but me and my brother cried together and hugged so I feel like I did the right thing.

Tl;dr dad acted like a crazy “sports parent” and I called him out on it, and told him he’s putting too much pressure on my little brother(12)  kinda feel bad for calling him out. But it lead to me and my little brother crying and hugging it out"	Not the A-hole	0	0	120.0	65.0	0.0	0.0

My parents told me that if i was caught doing something like that in their vehicles then they would take my drivers license, which they held true to. And now as of a couple weeks ago I started working for a company that my dad does work for as a contractor and property manager. A few days before I started working, dad got his Maine guide license so he can now do commercial charters. The day after he passe his test he had charters lined up for 3 days, Wednesday Thursday and Friday. On Wednesday my mom gave me a ride to work and realized just how early 430am is. So she told dad that she would not be able to give me a ride to and from work because it screws up her work day and thus I got my license back. I started driving again with the conditions that I am now paying for the gas and insurance for the truck that I am driving. Well I put $50 in the truck on Thursday to fill it up. I drove to and from work and then made a dump run. In total less than 40 miles. This truck get 17mpg city and when I went to go make the dump run today it was 3/8 of a tank. Dad has been taking advantage of the money that I'm putting into it and driving it for free now. Yes it is in his name but I am paying for it now. But if he is still going to drive it around I'm going to use their money to fill the tank and I am just going to pay for my insurance. So I'm just wanting to know if I am a butthole for thinking that if I am paying for the truck that I should be the one driving it and not them.

He said everyone sucks and it’s fine, but we have different standards because I am not good at ANY games. He then said it was because of pride, and I, not wanting to argue anymore, said sure.

My soon-to-be ex-husband asked me to go to church (We used to go every Sunday until life between us got bad and he quit going and then I lost my faith) and then to go eat when I had askes if he wanted the kids on Father's day or what he wanted to do. 

I told him I would not go to church but I'd meet him to eat. I got the boys up and got to his house at 915. Church starts at 930 and its about 10 to 15 minites away. I didn't think it was that bad since we've left at 920 and later before. Well, I did laundry and played games, lost track of time and realized I was going to be late for lunch. I leave immediatly and call him. 

I told him I lost track of time and that I was on my way. He told me he couldnt believe I was late again, and that I had been late this morning for church. When I questioned it he told me after droppinf the kids off at their respective classes he had got to the actual service at 9:35. I was pissed because we'd gotten their much later in the past but before I could say anything he told me that I want to still come I could but if I wanted to stay I could. 

I told him it wasnt my choice and that the only reason I was coming was for the kids. He asked if that was really the only reason and when I had said yes it was, he told me to just stay home. I've dealt with this attitude in the past but he texted me later calling me a selfish bitch for not coming to get the kids when they got home, because I had previous plans that I couldn't take the kids to. He said I had ruined Father's day because nothing he wanted seemed to matter.

It’s perfect for me and my small, older dog. Most of my neighbors are families of 4+. Dogs are allowed but must be leashed outside of exclusive space. We have a beautiful, large common green space. I would walk my dog along the walkways when we left the property to go for a walk. After a month, a woman who’s on the condo board tells me that i can’t walk my dog on the walkways if he pees on a bush, or touches the grass. This has made things less convenient for me, and way more stressful than it should be. I respected the ask, even though there’s no rule against dogs walking in the common green space. Today, I left my car at my parents, and my mom drove me back to my condo. Walking to my unit, who do I see? The board member with her much larger dog, off leash, in the very green space my dog may have inadvertently touched from the walkway. She jumped a mile when she saw me, making me think she probably checked to see if my car was in my garage (why else be so startled) Am I the asshole because now, I’ve stopped avoiding the green space, per this asshole’s special request?

He asked me if I wanted to rent a room. Why wouldn’t I? Rent is good and utilities get split between the three of us living there. We moved in last July. 

In September, out of the blue, he comes home with a dog. Never discussed it with two of us who also live there. I was like cool you got a dog, whatever. 

Within a month him and his gf start becoming more serious which is cool for them. They are are happy, I’m happy. The thing is, he basically lives at her house now. He comes home maybe once or twice a week. This has been going on since October. 

It was fine at first figured it was just a phase or whatever. Over 6 months later I realIze it was not a phase. 

Now I’m super appreciative of him for the cheap ass rent and letting me slide on a few months of rent when I was needing to work on my mental health. He has been very helpful and supportive, but now that I’m working 12
Hour days at my new job, I don’t have the time nor the desire to look after his dog anymore. 

I got pissed off about it and definitely said it in a rude way but regardless I felt like my concerns were valid. I understand him being defensive when I brought it up but his defense was being up the rent I owed him. The same rent he told me not to worry about several times.

So, my (17M) dad (44M) and I each drink a liter of diet soda at the beginning of each day and my mom doesn’t like it. She’s not happy that my dad started me on that habit 3 years ago and has wished he’d stop drinking it daily. Not only does she think I need to not drink it daily, she is not happy about the fact that I usually keep a week’s supply for my dad and I each at a time. She particularly disliked this as it’s always at easy access when I wake up and want soda. In her eyes, this is bad as I’m enabling my dad and I both to drink too much of the stuff. My reasoning for keeping it stocked in the house is that my dad and I don’t need to go to the corner store every morning for it when we have it at home. If it matters, I use the spare fridge in the garage for storing soda, so it’s not like I’m taking up fridge space that would be used for food or anything like that.	Asshole	0	0	676.0	61.0	0.0	0.0
c1gpii	2019-06-16 23:53:38		AITA If I (17M) Ignore My Dad After Catching Him Cheating Multiple Times?	"Since it’s Father’s Day, I thought it might be time to post this draft. I’m not the best writer so bear with me.

A little bit of a backstory... My family immigrated to Canada when I was young. My mom has looked after my sibling and I while my dad ran his business in our “home country” so I didn’t get to see him often. However, I would usually go spend time with him every summer.

Two years ago during the summer, I caught my father cheating while he was in the bathroom. He was whispering on the phone with some woman and I happened to hear it. Needless to say I was pretty upset and I confronted him about it after. I think I might’ve went into a little seizure or something out of shock and my body couldn’t stop shaking uncontrollably. When I calmed down, I asked him to promise me to never cheat again and he agreed. In hindsight, he probably promised me just to get me to calm down. I never spoke a word about it to my mom or sibling and I trust that he wouldn’t make the same mistake again. 

Fast forward another year when my entire family was in our “home country,” our neighbours told my mom that they kept consistently seeing my dad with another woman. We lived in an apartment complex so it was nearly impossible to not be seen by others lol. My mom was pretty furious about it but mostly at the fact that he brought another woman back to our house. Later, we found out that the woman actually brought her child and mother and left only two weeks before we arrived. My father had given her a key to our house. Utterly disgusting IMO. 

The divorce process has been nasty. Nothing has been settled yet and because of legal issues, my mom hasn’t been able to get closure. I’m assuming my dad doesn’t want to split his wealth which is why he’s dragging the divorce. It’s also pretty obvious that he has this hatred towards my mother for “not making home feel like home”.

Now my dad is living with another woman who has a child because he “needs someone to take care of him“. He has reached out and apologized to me in the past but I’ve been ignoring him. He occasionally guilt-trips me by telling me that I’ll regret not having a relationship with him when he’s old and on his death bed.

This entire situation has fucked me up so badly. I went from being a 90% average student to a 70-90% student who skips class constantly. I’ve climbed back up but my mentally health is honestly still kinda messed up.

To be honest, I don’t care much that he’s having affairs. I’m just upset that he broke our promise and is basically abusing my mom by not following
through with the divorce. He also hasn’t been there for me when I needed it. 

AITA Reddit? I understand his difficulty providing for our family but he really hurt us.

TLDR: my father cheated on my mother, ruined my trust in him after breaking our promise, isn’t following through with the divorce so we don’t have closure, and now lives with another woman."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Since I can remember, she has always been type of woman identifies with the old adage, “The woman/wife is always right.” Like men should want to cater to his woman’s every want and need. In the beginning, this mentality was sorta cute, and maybe even endearing? But as time went on, it has become pure resentment on my end. She will expect me to cater to her beck and call. If she needs something in the middle of the night for a project, I am to run to the store for her. If she needs a last minute errand, she will send me. If she forgets something, I’m supposed to go retrieve it for her. If she needs something that is not within arm’s reach, she sends me.. She often jokes about it, and says that I need to be a “gentleman,” and do it for her. It’s not funny anymore, and its causing serious problems for us. If I refuse to do what she asks, I get the silent treatment, and the “Fine, I’ll do it myself” thing, that is followed by passive aggressiveness for days. The really SHITTY part is that I can never rely on her for anything at all. She will flat out refuse to do small favors, and tasks that I need. It’s like she forgets all the stuff I do for her, or she just feels heavily entitled to everything that I do for her, and feels that she doesn’t need to reciprocate because she’s a woman..I have brought this up to her MANY times over the years, but she just doesn’t see it. We’ve had several discussion, both calm, and heated over this very topic. It drives me crazy, because I can’t tell if she’s gaslighting me, or if she honestly doesn’t see her own behavior? Every time we talk about it, she can never tell me why she thinks this double standard is okay... is it okay? Is it normal for the guy to cater to his wife, while she doesn’t need to reciprocate? 

It’s gotten to the point where I WONT want to do any favors for her. I feel a deep resentment when she asks me to do things for her, because I KNOW that if the roles were reversed, she would NOT do the same for me. She’s proven this to me time and time again. 

Today we got into a big fight over her wanting me to take photos of her for her Instagram, and I got so upset. It’s obviously not about taking the photos, but more so about all of this resentment I have over the double standards.

I respect him cause he's my dad and he takes care of the family but the thing is, while he says he doesn't hate me, every day I hear him complain about me. Every morning, I can hear how he calls me lazy and stuff like that, and he yells at me for the smallest thing.

I don't know if it's mental abuse or not but he would call me stupid most of the time I'm around him or when I do something wrong. 

I specifically remember him in a PTC to my math teacher, he would ask him if I was stupid ( though I didn't have the best grades, I wasn't fucking stupid). I felt humiliated.

He also doesn't just insult me, he does it to his mother too. He always yells at her and tells her to shut up, and I get so fucking mad when he does. Our nan is basically the maid of the house, I always respect her for that and help her but she gets treated like crap. 

I genuinely feel like he's the reason for my depression, anxiety, and insecurity. 

I always stay in my room or basement when he's home and distract myself on the computer. 

Anyways today my parents told me to get ready to go out and eat with them, for graduation, fathers day and their anniversary.

I didn't want to go cause why would I want to go to a place in public, just to hear him complain about me. 

Why would I want to hear him shit on me? 

I'm sick of the negativity, it made me into a person I don't want to be, being depressed and insecure. 

I then told my mom I didn't want to go out with the family and she kept telling me to go. 

She then ask ""why? do you not care for the family?"" 

I then said ""I do but you don't seem to understand.""

My wife's pregnant half sister went into labour on Friday, so my wife dropped everything (including cancelling the marriage counselor) and decided to go help out. She planned this without telling me, although I knew there was a chance she would go. I don't begrudge her going at all, because we desperately needed help when we were pregnant, and this was a time to help others. We only have one car, so she waited for me to come home from work Friday afternoon and left pretty soon after. She took our two eldest children with her (my stepchildren) and left our two toddlers with me - so she could take the eldest to see their grandparents who lived locally to my wife's half sister, all about 3 hours away.


She promised (pinky promised!) she'd be back in time on Sunday to share Father's Day with me, and so that all our children could be together for me. She even said she'd be back in time to prepare a father's Day meal for me. I was looking forward to this because for the last two years I've had to be away for work on father's Day.


I had a pleasant enough weekend at home with our two youngest, but it's never the same when half your family is gone. I got plenty of message from my wife saying she missed us etc.


My wife returned home around 7pm Sunday evening and almost immediately walking from the car she said ""oh I'm too tired to cook you dinner"". When I said she could have given me warning that I needed to make other arrangements she said she'd been too busy to tell me. 


She then got herself some snacks to eat, let the two eldest get their own food, and I ended up cooking and eating my own father's Day meal by myself. Any other day this would not really be an issue, but I felt sad and aggrieved that she would be so indifferent to my feelings on father's Day. However, when I tried asking her about it, she went on about how I never think about her feelings, and that I've missed other family occasions before (I'm in the military and away a lot).


Does it make me the asshole for reading too much into this? Should I just let it go? When I think about it, it doesn't seem a bit deal, but then it does.


Two other points: 1. She did get the kids to write a card and give me chocolates - I wasn't forgotten. 2. On mother's Day, I cooked her a meal which she refused to eat because she was angry about something the kids did, and then called it the worst mother's Day she'd had - so I know she values such days herself."

So tonight, my family and I (dad, mom, uncle, brother and I) went out to dinner at a nice restaurant. I’ve recently been dealing with chronic hunger issues - basically no matter what I eat/how much I eat, I’m constantly hungry and in a debilitating way where I can’t focus/think properly. My suspicion was that this is linked to insulin problems - my dad is diabetic and excessive hunger is linked to that and, in the past, I’ve also had classic diabetes symptoms of increased ruination/thirst and my blood sugar levels have tested to be higher than average. Anyways...

I haven’t seen my family in awhile, and at dinner, I was telling them about this issue. I was trying to explain how frustrating and debilitating it is while also explaining that I had tried to change my diet to no avail. Dinner is eventually served and I eat my food only to still be hungry afterwards. I didn’t finish my food - there were still some leftover portions of the food left but nothing that would’ve helped the very bad hunger I was having. In my frenzy and frustration, I start Googling my symptoms (even though I’ve done that before) because I so desperately wanted the pain to go away when my uncle said, “You know, you shouldn’t text while you eat, that doesn’t help your hunger.” I ignored this comment because I knew I was in too much pain and frustration to respond sufficiently.

About ten minutes later, my parents ordered a chocolatey dessert for us all to share, and I told them I didn’t want to have any. At this point, all of the frustrations and pains from the last couple of weeks dealing with this had made me feel exhausted and, through experience, I had seen that no amount of eating was really helping my feeling of hunger, so I felt very hopeless (and didn’t think a couple bites of cake would do anything). My uncle then said, “You need to eat some cake and the leftover scraps of your food. That’s why your hungry.” I tried to briefly explain despite being in a lot of pain that no matter what I ate, I always seemed to be hungry and he just said, “No, you’re not eating enough. If you would just eat more, this wouldn’t be a problem.” (This is somewhat paraphrased, but the general gist of it.) 

At this point, I was upset and angry. I had already explained plenty how much I had been eating these past couple weeks and how stressful/frustrating this experience was for me. It just made me so angry that he blamed me basically throughout the whole night about a situation that was very painful and upsetting to me (and this is a new situation! It’s not like I’m suddenly eating less than I ever used to!) instead of just...empathizing and leaving me be. I ended up causing a bit of a scene at the restaurant by getting out of our table and, through my tears, (kind of loudly)telling my family that this is a very frustrating experience for me and that I would appreciate them being more empathetic/not blaming me for it. I then left the restaurant. 

So AITA for how I acted? Thank you in advance!

EDIT: I guess I should mention that I COULD be eating more, but also, I’m eating the same amount that I always have and it’s a normal, healthy amount. I’ve been keeping a food diary on Chronometer, and according to that, I’m getting all of my caloric and nutrient needs met, just like I always have. But I will admit that I definitely do have more erratic eating habits (I wake up late, so I sometimes don’t eat until later in the day), but I always try and eat enough."	Asshole	0	0	3.0	6.0	0.0	0.0

My girlfriend and I have lived together for the past 4 years. We've been together for five years and she recently decided to end our relationship because she wants more time to work on herself and deal with her childhood issues. So, seeing how all of her immediate family has moved out of state, we are in Michigan and they are in one of the Carolinas, I decided to let her stay here for the next three months until she found a place to live. We had agreed that she would pay me $80 a week in rent. She does have a sister that lives less than three miles from here but she already has one roommate and lives with her husband so that is not a viable option at this time.
Yesterday I left to go to Ohio to visit my dad for Father's Day. I come home only to discover that she had a guy over last night without telling me. The way I found out is because she made dinner last night, clean up the dishes, and placed two bowls that were dirtied with the same food in the sink, and place to Forks on top.
When I first politely asked her if someone was over last night, she said no. When she asked me why I asked I told her because I know that someone was here and I just want to know who was in my house. By the way the house is in my name if it matters.
She then confessed to me that she had her guy friend over for dinner.
Because she doesn't have a car, or a driver's license, I have been giving her rides to and from work when I'm available. I've already told her that she needs to find another way home tonight because I'm not going to do it.
If I'm out of line here, please tell me.
Thank you.

Mandy and I briefly met through our college rugby clubs. All around great person charismatic, smart, and attractive. A few weeks later we matched on tinder. We began talking and hit it off. Fast forward, Mandy and I have been dating for the past 4-5 months. We both have had conversations that we are mutually exclusive and aren't talking to anyone else. Things are good and we’re talking about plans for the summer and possibly meeting each other families/friends etc. One night Mandy told me that someone we both know, let's call him Henry, made a funny comment about super liking her on tinder. From a guys perspective its easy to see Henry's intention. It was to casually, and yes jokingly, say he's interested in her. Her response to Henry was something along the lines of “she doesn't use tinder anymore” trying to play it off as shes not interested. Which I don't have any issue with either of their comments. I don't expect Henry to know about Mandy and I situation. My belief is that it all starts and ends with her, guys will try regardless but I trust her so it doesn't matter to me 

However, it got me thinking. Did Henry recently superlike her? Meaning her tinder is still active. I asked Mandy if Henry said anything about how recent he did it. She had no idea. So I straight up asked if she ever deleted her account. She only deleted the app. Which is nbd alot of people dont realize that you need to actually delete the account itself and not just the app. Which I told her so you know...she could go and delete the account since were dating…like I did 

Some time had gone by and it kinda wouldn't leave the back of my mind that the girl im dating still could be popping up on tinder. I would subtly ask if she got rid of it here and there with no real response as to if she did or not. Even if she said yes how would I know unless she went out of her way to show me. Which seemed excessive to ask for. 

I knew she would be leaving to go home to Long Island soon so I used it as an opportunity. Like I said before if you delete the app the account is still viewable to others. Although, since the app is no longer downloaded it can not update the location to the account. Meaning if I found her account updating its location to LI then shes probably still using it/ she never deleted the app like she said 

So I made a fake tinder and found her account, as was expected. Once she was home I used the developer tool in google chrome to change my geolocation to see if I could still find her in the slide deck at home. And yup her account updated its location. 

So am I an asshole for seeing if I could find her on tinder and seeing if it would update before I made it a bigger issue?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1gk8k	2019-06-16 23:38:36		AITA Refused to eat the meal my husband made	"A little background: the cooking/food aspect of our relationships skews a little on the more traditional side. I (F) generally make 95% of our meals and do all the grocery shopping. My husband hates the grocery store with all his soul and has never been a great cook. A lot of times if I don’t want to cook he is totally ok with going out to eat or throwing in a frozen pizza. 

It’s not that he doesn’t “like” to cook. I genuinely think he doesn’t get how to. We have tried Blue Apron and Hello Fresh as a way to give him clear directions but it never sticks (and not sustainable financially). 

A year ago I had him try to make dinner one night. He made “Corn Pie” where he boiled some rice, dumped marinara sauce, added canned corn, and scrambled eggs on top. I’m not kidding. He said “well, we love all these ingredients so I added them together!” I didn’t eat that and it’s an ongoing reminder and lesson of what NOT to do. 

We had a busy weekend and a pretty empty fridge. I told him I wanted to go out and grab food. He declined saying he doesn’t want us to spend the money and asked what we can have at home. I told him the fridge is pretty bare so not many options but he would have to manage cooking then. He said ok and I went to the other room as I expected him to boil some pasta and throw some sauce on it. 

He comes into the other room and says “I call this around the world.”  He sets the plate down and there’s Trader Joe’s Tikka Masala frozen dinner, Trader Joe’s Soup frozen dumplings, and an egg frittata (from TJs in frozen section).  Obviously all microwaved. But I just paused. And got kinda mad. 

On one hand I feel ungrateful that I didn’t want to eat his Around the World or that I didn’t give him directions/idea of what to make. 
But on the other hand, buying/prepping/cooking all the meals is exhausting and it feels like I should be able to trust my partner to make a simple meal if he doesn’t want to pay the premium to eat out. A meal of Asian dumplings, an Indian chicken dish, and a breakfast egg frittata is just ridiculous.

I am looking for help to make a decision on whether I should stand firm or give in.

&#x200B;

We live several flight-hours away from either of our families.

&#x200B;

My husband has a very large family. They are mostly very nice people, but their respective personality quirks make it so that being with them is very stressful for me, especially because, in order to be a ""good"" daughter in law, I constantly bite my tongue/behave in way I would rather not. Personal changes in my husbands and my life will probably make all the things that make being with them exhausting even more taxing.

&#x200B;

Last year, I spent my entire summer-vacation with them. I returned entirely exhausted.

&#x200B;

We both have very demanding jobs and I cannot wait for my time off. This year was especially stressful and we did not have much time for each other.

&#x200B;

They have planned a vacation and want us to book the same one. If we did what they want, we would spend our vacation with them again. I said ok, but not the whole time. We can ""overlap"". The question is how much overlap. My husband wants half or more than half the time. I want it to be considerably less.

Over time she became increasingly more and more negative. Like we couldn't have a conversation without her complaining about something bad in her life, past or present.

We slowly started seeing one another less because I just didn't ever want to spend time with her. We would get lunch together maybe only once every two weeks and I always dreaded it. We would talk and I would leave feeling happy it was over.

This continued for a year, us only really seeing one another once every two weeks. Then, one week she was talking about her friends and how she asked them if they would learn sign language. She is hard of hearing and even partially deaf, so she wanted to be able to talk with them more easily.

She said they refused to learn and that she felt like they ""must not have really been her friends"" because of that.

I mostly nodded my head and tried to console her, then she asked me if I would learn. And I was really taken back. I couldn't imagine trying to learn a new form of communication while still being a full-time college student working part time. Eventually I said I didn't think I could, and I sensed she was upset.

Over time we stopped talking due to other reasons, but I've always wondered if I was really in the wrong.

"**The Incident:** So 'David' and I are hanging out one night at his place along with another friend on the night of his mother's birthday. There's a buncha (mostly elder) people over downstairs celebrating her bday, and we are upstairs hanging out. His relationship with his parents is a little distant, so we assume he kind of just wants to be upstairs. David is still being aloof, kinda weird, and just overall getting under our nerves. We try to call him out on it but he's still being weird. I'm irked by his coldness so I kind of try and do something to get a reaction out of him. An *edgy joke* of sorts that we always make. His phone is unlocked and I send a message to his brother ""I don't care about Mom!"" and that's that. A pretty stupid text, that at the moment I thought was troll-y and continued our ""edgy"" humor.

But, eventually his brother walks in looking for him saying ""Why would you send that message? That's so mean."" And David is confused, because he doesn't have his phone.... immediately I'm scared. Fuuuuck.... this message that I meant as a troll/joke didn't really work and honestly wasn't even all that funny - but I didn't mean it with malice. Now David is pissed and convincing his brother. He asks all the people in the room who had his phone, but nobody (including myself out of being scared in the moment) says anything. He asks me, I lie and say no and leave his place... Soon enough, couple days later, he kind of figures out it was me and I don't admit to anything - I don't say I did it nor do I deny it, kind of lying by omission... shitty I know. 

But, after being pressed on it, I tell him it WAS me over a long text message & a hand-delivered letter where I absolutely poured my heart out telling him how sorry I was & insensitive it was to him.

**Present:** WELL, it's been 3 months and he hasn't read my apology, nor gotten back to me, & he told another mutual friend of ours that he ""has no intention of reading the letter/msg.""

Weeks pass and I send him a very lengthy apology text, mail him a gift, and also send him a very long heartfelt letter how sorry I am, how much our friendship means and that I'm basically bad for doing that. --- It's been 3 months and no response from him - I heard from our mutual friend that he ""doesn't want to read the letter.""

"I became unintentionally pregnant a few months ago, once I told my boyfriend he was over the moon once he got over the initial shock. I felt like a fucking monster when I interrupted him in the middle of his happy babbling about buying baby stuff and telling his parents, I told him I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep it and the mood quickly did a 180 from there. He sat me down and told me that it was up to me to decide what to do about the baby because I was one the carrying it and he'd support me no matter what. While sweet it somehow managed to make me feel even worse.

We both agreed early in our relationship that we wanted children when we got our lives sorted out and were financially stable, but my boyfriend simply adores children and is always at his happiest when playing with his niece and infant nephew. So he clearly wouldn't mind having children a bit earlier and I feel like a shitty girlfriend for depriving him of that.

I spent a full week thinking it over but in the end I decided to get an abortion. We're both only 21 and still studying in university. Along with that while we're both financially responsible we still only barely get by on our rent, working part time and going to university full time wouldn't leave us with enough time and money to properly raise a child together.

I told him my decision and while he clearly had a hurt look on his face he agreed with my decision and said it would be the smart thing to do. Two weeks later I had the the abortion. There was a *lot* of mutual crying and we both took a few days off to cope with it. My boyfriend -sweetheart that he is- tries not to get upset around me, knowing how guilty it makes me feel. But it's obvious from silent phases he's become prone to and the fact that's been distancing himself away from his niece and nephew that he's not coping well with it.

I've tested the waters to see if he's willing to go to my therapy sessions with me but he's insisted that there's no need.

They have a lot of other friends who they’ve known since childhood (very social, drugs and relationships type people) while they were basically my only ones, so I felt like I never really fit in the group, but I was just happy that I actually managed to make friends.

One of the girls from their friend group started hanging out with the three of us at lunch, but for some reason she hated me. She always called me a hoe because of my clots, and often made fun of my personality (usually backhandedly) since I’m quiet and “weird” I guess. Always while my friends were around. 

I do OMAD to maintain my body shape and so I skip lunch most of the time, but occasionally (once a week?) they would offer me food that they didn’t want, which I would take sometimes. Whenever the mean girl would offer me food she would throw it at me, which I would laugh at to ease the tension (which I also did with her insults) and take the food since i was always hungry. To this day I don’t understand why she was so rude to me though? She had a boyfriend and is more conventionally attractive, and has more friends, so I’m just assuming she acted like that because I let her. My family is rich (which a lot of people at school talked about since there’s rumors about me having maids and living in a mansion) while she’s not though.

Anyways one day they all ditched me at lunch, and when I found them the mean girl wouldn’t let me sit down with them and refused to move her stuff which was blocking the chairs, and started berating me like she usually does and my friends just sat there quietly, but instead of laughing like usual I just said that I was leaving. And that was the last time I talked to any of them.

I had class with one of my friends and she kept trying to apologize to me for weeks but I ignored her. I blocked their numbers. I avoided them completely and hung out in the bathroom or the library at lunch. My acquaintances who know that I was really good friends with them though have all said I was the asshole for ghosting them because “they weren’t the ones being rude, it was the mean girl”. I feel like I was getting bullied though, my description can’t capture the way it made me feel. 

My mom is also concerned and saying I was wrong (even though I never told her why we stopped being friends) because I burned bridges with my middle school friends as well (so it looks bad), but I don’t want to be around people who don’t stick up for me and continue to be friends with someone who is cruel for no reason?

Me and 3 of my friends were going to eat and watch a movie together, it's a yearly tradition that we do this whenever we get out of high school for summer. We were at the restaurant when my friend, Ally, seen her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend, she had really liked him and he cheated on her so she cannot stand the sight of him, we're eating and Ally's ex comes up to us and tells Ally that it's good to see her, they, more like he, talked for 10 minutes and he went to pay his check, she's visibly pissed because of him talking to her, we finish up and I pay the check, we make it inside my car and I tell her sorry about how she had to talk to him, she makes a comment about how he ruined her night, we're halfway to the theater when her and my friend start arguing for some reason, idk what had happened because, I had music on and it makes it so I can barely hear a thing from the back seats, Ally starts yelling at my friend, Adam, beside her and she makes a comment about his weight, I have turned the music down by this point and me and next to me were saying, that was uncalled for, I asked why she yelled at him, she said something along the line that he wouldn't drop the subject about her ex, she called him fat-ass in the sentence so I didn't care at that time what he did, I tell her just to STFU if you're gonna talk you your friend like that, she then insulted me by making fun of my mom. I then told her to get TF out of my car, she started apologizing, I was so mad I didn't care, I just told her to gtfo again, she did and I made sure she called someone to come get her before we left. So, AITA?

Edit 1: what Adam was saying to her was an apology and what he would've done in the situation. This went down yesterday too so I am still getting information, too.

So, I was sitting at home earlier playing fifa and there was a knock at the door and I looked and there was a white dude sitting in the chair by the door with his hood up. I looked through the window and there was a black dude standing there also with his hood up, bearing in mind it wasn’t raining. I got a weird vibe so I picked up the bat by the door and when I answered this sketchy ass guy asked me if I had any money I was like ”nah bro”, trying to keep it casual. Then he asked me for a cigarette and stood a litttle closer so I kinda pulled the bat a little closer and said “no”and these two guys kinda eyed me up and saw that I was holding a Louisville slugger and left. Should I be sketched out? Should I have reported it to the cops as suspicious? Were they casing the joint? I’m at work now and unsure if I’m gonna come back and my had been burgled. Also, I thought I would mention ethnicities because although I am not a racist I did get sketched out at the sight of a black guy with his hood up standing at my door in the middle of the day. But then again there was also a white guy there so AITA and also subconsciously racist or am I just naturally fearful and a bit of a wimp?	Not the A-hole	0	0	4.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c1g727	2019-06-16 23:01:30	baddaddyo101	AITA for not wanting my son.	"
Brief overview: my ex and I had a horrible falling out, she accused me of domestic violence and took my son away from me. I fought tooth and nail to be award joint legal/physical custody. She made the process harder by marrying into money and law enforcement, but in the end I got what I wanted. The problem began when she forced our son to call him “dad”, which I was fine with, but I started not being included in appointments, school events/ emergency contact lists as his father, it was his stepdad. Meanwhile, my ex brainwashed our son to think SD is more important than myself because of money. My son is 8 now and he doesn’t care about me and frankly treats me bad. 

The problem: part of our agreement is that we get him for respected parent holidays ie mothers/Father’s Day. On my school day he told me he was working on a Father’s Day gift for me. He went to his moms for her days and he was returned to me today with no gift. Now, it’s not about receiving a gift, but when he saw me I got no happy Father’s Day, instead I was greeted with a “I forgot to make you a gift”. I asked him what happened I thought you worked on one in school. He replied claiming he made nothing, which was a lie. I confronted about his lie, which he denied twice before admitting he gave it to his dad (SD). Again, it’s not about the gift it’s about the lie. This isn’t the first time he’s lied to me and I’ve talked to him about how bad lying is. I’m not going deny, my feelings are hurt, mostly because he feels like he has to lie to me and that he prefers SD to me because of the lies his mom is telling about myself. He’s told me he doesn’t love me/ not suppose to love me because his mom threatens to take her love away from him; and has to love SD or no gifts/vacations. 

I’ve given so much for him financially, emotionally and physically. I have given so many opportunities up, and I’ve tried so many different ways to understand his thought process and to be honest and truthful to him, but still nothing back. I’m at that point that I’m no longer happy because he always looks miserable around me and he doesn’t appreciate anything I give him because to him it’s always a comparison (SD/mom got him something better). And as much as it pains me to say, I regret fighting this hard for him. People say it’ll get easier, but it’s not. AITA for wanting to give up the fight.

EDIT/UPDATE: Honestly I didn’t expect this post to get this much traction. I want to thank everyone who commented, who took the time to read what I wrote, that what you wrote didn’t go unnoticed. I apologise I can’t respond to everyone since this was so overwhelming. 

I just want to express that i read every comment, I understand and accept the judgement given to me. I do want to clear a few things up. First and most importantly, I tell my son everyday I have him, every time I see him and every phone conversation I get with him that I love him. Second is that I should have expressed this was a feeling and not actually going through with it. Third, the domestic violence was on me not her, I had witnesses who testified on my behalf and it went to court. Lastly, my son is in therapy, he has a court appointed one, a personal one and he has a weekly meeting with his school counsellor.

Again, thank you for sharing your thoughts, i know and understand this is a controversial and sensitive topic. I appreciate all of those who gave advice and suggestions in what I could do to help my son, better our relationship, my mental state and legally (amongst other things). Thank you to those who shared their personal experiences, both parents (step-parents) and children of divorce. Hearing experiences made me realise I’m not alone, that people go through this too, that me feeling anything remotely negative is fine, it comes down to acting on it. Like many of you said the best I can do now is make sure he understands I’m there and will always be there for him no matter what, I know it’s going to be a long hard battle, but he is my son and worth every second of it. I guess it took a few strangers to make me realise that."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Long story short he's kinda an asshole( his own daughter hasn't seen or talked to him in over 3 years) He's borderline abusive, always fighting with my mom or my sister, I don't see him as a father figure. The only reason I am glad he is around is because I guess my mom is happy when they're not fighting because no one else is left to stay with her (sister is in college, I moved out). I don't feel bad about not calling him because he's rarely ever done anything for me, and he isn't even a good father to his own daughter, or my sister	Not the A-hole	0	0	173.0	33.0	0.0	0.0

She recently started a new Instagram, where she posts photos of her latest outfits, and current trends. That’s fine with me, but she’s constantly asking me to take photos of her so she can post them. This is a weekly thing.. and it’s really starting to annoy me. The most frustrating part is her complaining and telling me how bad of a photographer I am. She’s constantly telling me that the angles are bad, that I have no vision, and how can I not see how to take a good photo. Why is she asking me to take photos of her if I’m such a shitty photographer?? She knows that I no longer want to be her photographer, and that it bothers me when she is constantly asking me to take pictures when we are out, and I’m just trying to enjoy myself and spend time together.  Lately, she’s been being really sneaky about it by asking if I want to go to a bar, or somewhere to spend time together.. but I know she’s only asking because she wants me to take photos of her latest outfit. This really bothers me because she’s knows what she’s doing..I’m not stupid, and know the photos are the real reason she’s asking me to go somewhere..Today we went to have a nice lunch together, and I thought we were just gonna be hanging out. We hadn’t spoken all weekend due to an unrelated argument... As we are walking along, guess what? **Surprise, “can you take photos of my shoes?” It really upset me because we haven’t spoken all weekend, and I thought it was nice to spend Father’s Day together having some drinks and enjoying each other’s company. 

She made a snark comment about me being upset because she asked me to photograph her... yea I’m upset.. I don’t want to have a photo shoot. That’s not why I came here. We haven’t spoken all weekend, and now you want me to take more photos of you?? It got heated, and we are currently not speaking.

c1g6hv	2019-06-16 23:00:02	throwawayjpntripbnb	AITA for asking my now ex-boyfriend to pay for half of my Airbnb fees?	"My ex and I dated for 6 years, 2 of which at the end were long distance because I moved to Canada for a new job and he remained in Tokyo (where I also lived for the first 4 years). We would take turns visiting each other, about once every six months during this time, and our goal was for him to move to Canada sometime this year or next year to be with me.

Well long story short, two months ago I booked tickets and got time off to visit him for two weeks in July. Got plane tickets, planned trips to various places in Japan, booked hotels and whatnot. Two weeks ago I found out he was cheating on me with someone from his work. The only reason I even found out was because I was/am friendly with one of his coworkers, who thought it was a good idea to tell me. This had apparently been going on for 6-8 months.

I was absolutely fucking devastated but broke up with him. Still processing it, to be honest. He showed absolutely no indication that he'd do anything like this.

Now the problem is that I have nowhere to stay for my trip next month, since I was supposed to be staying at his place. My plane tickets are non-refundable, and so are all of our hotel bookings. I looked up Airbnbs and found that a two-week stay at a decent place in Tokyo costs about $1000. It would be less but it's soon so I guess it's more expensive.

I called him, explaining that I was gonna go on the trips we planned by myself, and that I wanted him to pay for half the Airbnb fees, since I hadn't budgeted for him cheating on me.

He's refusing, saying I'm being petty and vengeful and that there are other options: cancelling my plane tickets/hotel bookings (I could but they're non-refundable and it's a waste), staying at a hostel (cheaper than $1000 I guess, but I wasn't planning on staying in a hostel, I was planning on being in an apartment), etc.

He makes quite a lot of money and isn't struggling financially in any way, so I think it's reasonable of me to ask him to do this, especially as for ME this all is a LOT of money. He said now that we're not dating he has no obligation to pay for anything for me, and the fact that I'm asking makes me look like a crazy vengeful gold-digger. My friends are also divided on whether or not this is something I should be asking for.

I guess I just want to know if I am being unreasonable? I guess I could cancel the trip altogether but I don't wanna let him ruin my vacation like that. Am I the asshole here?

**TL;DR**: Was supposed to visit boyfriend in Tokyo for 2 weeks, find out he's cheating on me, need to get an Airbnb now that we've broken up. He thinks I'm a ""gold-digging asshole"" for asking for half the Airbnb fees, but I think it's reasonable."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

When picking the rotation we were told that we had to report 2-3 days/week at this office and if asked, we could go to his other offices. I have recently leased a car for my actual rotations (mandatory) coming up, but I can barely afford that as it is and have to often ask my parents for help. His other offices are a minimum of 80 miles each way. Both the physician and his staff often try to pressure myself and my colleagues into going to these offices full well knowing the gas and mileage on our cars will be a huge financial strain. We have tried to explain this to him several times and it seems this is a recurring issue each month our students rotate with him. He also has undergraduate students who participate in these rotation, but they are paid for the time and he uses them as examples as to what we should be doing. He often mentions carpooling when we bring up the issue of gas and mileage, however we were not expected by our administration to attend these offices in the first place.

I’ve done a lot for one of my friends. He comes from a bad family situation and generally didn’t have a lot of direction in his life. For the past few years, I’ve always been there for him. He’s on remote work assignments but he would call me 1-4x a week and vent. I would, in turn, vent about my own life, but slowly he stopped helping me with my own issues. It was all about him.

Soon, he would make comments about my partner and how they were not right for me and would hint he wanted us to break up. At first, I thought they were funny and joking, but then they got darker and downright mean. 

My friend would call with a different career plan weekly and expect me to help and talk through it with him. He would pile on his relationship issues, make mistakes and then ask me for advice but wouldn’t listen. He would call and say he wanted me to tell him everything was okay and he was making good choices. I started to get very burnt out dealing with him and straight up told him to break up with his girlfriend because I wasn’t going to hear it anymore. He would call about her every other day.

Then, I took a job working nights. I said please don’t call me, just text. He proceeded to call me daily for a week straight. I ignored his calls. He began telling me sob stories about his work and how much everyone hates him.

I stopped taking his calls and faded out until I did a tremendous favor and he never said thank you to me. Apparently, “no one but me” would do it and it almost cost me my own job. 

I later found out he’s been continuously lying to me after talking to his girlfriend. He tells her a different version of things than myself. 

I come from a very bad home situation and not many people know about it. I’ve never used it to get ahead, but my friend uses his to manipulate people and make them feel bad.

Finally it came to a head. I told him I know he’s been lying to me, manipulating me, and not understanding healthy boundaries. I said you don’t respect my partner or myself and I am done being a free therapist. Whenever I wanted to vent he would “have to go” and “was suddenly busy.” I said we can be friends but you need to respect me, my partner, and my boundaries. I didn’t yell but it was a very stern voice with witnesses. I said I was extremely upset about my favor and had no acknowledgement from him. Not even a thank you—just a social media post about how “he” did it all himself. 

I made him cry. This was a month ago and he hasn’t even said I’m sorry or asked to talk.

I was at a buddies bachelor party weekend in Denver, CO. Saturday night rolls around and \~1-2am a group of us decide to go to a strip club. I had never been to one before and wanted to check it out. About 6 of us head on in and quickly hit up the bar after giving the place a once over. Pretty quickly a couple of the guys found a girl to give the bachelor a private dance. The two of them head off to the back while the rest of us start hanging out around the stage.

At this point I am just hanging out and enjoying the show. A few girls come on and off the stage and I was even throwing some money around (really not much). Eventually I am standing up near the stage and a girl comes up to me and says ""I have been looking all over for you!"". Now, I know this girl wasn't looking anywhere for me, it felt like a panhandler throwing a routine at me. Not really knowing what else to do I just tell her ""No thanks"" thinking she'd leave me alone. I really didn't want any private attention and was thinking our group would be heading out anytime as soon as the bachelor was done with his dance.

Her response to this was ""Why would you say 'no thanks' when I haven't offered you anything?"". I tried to explain that I am just here for a buddies bachelor party and just wasn't interested in anything. Keep in mind the club was extremely loud and it was very difficult to hear anything. Throughout our entire exchange there were a lot of ""WHATS?"" going back and forth. After this she says to me in a very offended tone of voice ""You come across as kind of a dick"".  Really not knowing what to do or why a stripper is mad at me I just start apologizing and try to tell her again that I am just here to support a friend and wasn't interested in a private dance. Again she tells me, getting more and more aggressive that she hadn't offered me a dance and it was extremely rude to assume that she would.

At this point I literally put my hands up in surrender, apologize again, and tell her this is the first time I have ever been to a strip club. I really didn't know what to expect. Again she it literally scolding me and tells me to not be such an asshole next time. I just leave my hands up in surrender as she walks away to another dude.

Was I really such a big asshole or was she having a rough day and wanted to take it out on me? I told my friends this after it happened and they all just joked about it but I now have a bad taste in my mouth about visiting a strip club ever again."	Not the A-hole	0	0	383.0	27.0	0.0	0.0

This was a few years ago when my family went to visit my aunts family in AZ . Everyone was having a great time drinking and listening to music and shit like that . You know, a classic Mexican family barbecue with a roasted pig and tacos and what not. Spirits are high and everyone is having a fun ol time. That sets the stage. 

There I am minding my own business when nature calls, obviously I head to the restroom completely unaware of the sticky and dare I say smelly situation that was about to unfold.  I knock on the door and theres someone using it, no problem right?  Person opens it and who else is it but my brother! He barely even glances at me with that buzzed face of his as he runs out of the restroom.  I naturally don't think anything of it and do my business, im standing there peeing when I start to smell it . 

And then I saw it, right there in the trash can . Staring at me from behind some clumsily placed toilet paper, with its viscous eyes. A huge pile of crap . Stunned as I was I finished my business and as I headed out one of my cousins entered the restroom behind me. A little snippet of what was to come came to me , and I dreaded being blamed for the monstrosity that occured in there so I had no choice. 

I had to out my brother , sneakily of course.  So I went over to my dad and told him someone had shit in the trash can. My father foward as he is, walked in there , grabbed the trash bag. Came out and firmly asked everyone in attendance ""Who shit in the trash? "" . From there it was basic deduction and my brother was ousted as the pooper. 

I recounted this story to my group of friends and general consensus was i am the asshole. for screwing my brother and embarrassing him.

I recently started an internship, and have been working around 50 hours a week while also taking online classes. As such, I'm tired when I come home, and just want to unwind by doing nothing--no social contact with anyone--just me and Netflix.

Recently, my mom's been having some troubles (can't go too deep into the details), and has been crying to me about it every time I go home. When she calls me, it's frequently about those issues, and she rants about how hard it is to deal with everything. I am simply not good with people crying as I don't like to express my own emotions, so it's really uncomfortable for me when she starts crying. Any time I try to offer advice, she just gets angry with me, and that ends up making me frustrated at the fact that I have to listen to all her shit.

Therefore, I didn't pick up her calls at all last week, and even though I felt bad, I'm glad I did it. I'm tired enough as it is when I come home, and I don't want to deal with the baggage that my mom puts on me. When I ask her what she wants me to do, she just says she wants me to listen. When I just listen, she complains that I'm not reacting enough. Wtf does she want me to do?

When I went home this weekend, my brother called me a bitch and a 'bad daughter' because I ignored her calls, so I countered and said why he couldn't be there for her instead. He says that my mom never tells him anything, and says she can only talk to me about those issues. I feel like I'm always the one to have to deal with my mom when she gets lonely/sad/angry, and I hate it. I hate the fact that I feel obligated to act as her therapist/friend. I am thankful that she provided for me despite how hard everything was, but frankly, I just want to live my life, and having to cater to her emotional swings is not on my agenda.

I just don't get why my mom can't be satisfied with me coming home once a week, and letting everything out then. Why does she feel the need to call me EVERY SINGLE DAY about her problems? And the thing is, she doesn't even call her own mom everyday. I don't understand how she expects me to treat her as the number one person in my life when she doesn't do the same for her own mother.

So about 2ish weeks ago I was texting with one of my friends (we are all women btw) about a local power outage. We both lost power but she got her power back a few hours after I did so she was powerless for longer. She texts me this and I respond with ""that sucks"". She then texts me that I always say ""that sucks"" instead of ""i'm sorry"" which catches me by surprised because 1) I didn't realize I did it that much (though in retrospect I'm pretty sure I do so I don't think there's any exaggeration here) and 2) I didn't think this was an ""I'm sorry"" situation. I know the latter is kinda assholey and while I felt for her because power outages suck I didn't felt like I had any need to be sorry. I didn't cause the situation, I was also dealing with a very similar situation, and I felt like saying 'i'm sorry' would have been insincere (I didn't say any of this to her by the way). She's not mean texting me this and the convo moves to a group chat where the two of us and another friend teasingly discuss this. I sort of laugh it off and agree with them. While I don't get the big deal I know it matters to her so I make a mental note to text/tell my friends ""i'm sorry"" instead of just ""that sucks"" from now on.

I  feel bad because I don't want to blow my friends off or imply that I don't sympathize and feel for them, but I've also been told by people to not say 'i'm sorry' so often so I'm getting really conflicting opinions. I also don't know what else to say in that kind of situation.

This got brought up again yesterday after I texted her about a serious situation. Now this was a situation where I would have said ""i'm sorry"" regardless because I really felt sorry for her. She mentioned the 'i'm sorry thing' and while the conversation about it doesn't go anywhere I'm still curious:

AITA for saying ""that sucks"" instead of ""i'm sorry""?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you guys for the feedback I really appreciate it!! I was worried there was some social etiquette that I didn't realize so I'm grateful for everyone's feedback!! For the record I don't think my friend is an ahole, I think it's just a preference that we don't share but I care about her and if it matters to her then I'll say ""I'm sorry"". I am also thinking of changing up what I say, or at least giving it some variety because I do think I probably say it too much. I'm rambling now and no one cares cause this is such a small issue but again I appreciate everyone's replies."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1fwvc	2019-06-16 22:33:51	josedelmar	AITA for not wanting to talk with my boss about work on my holidays?	"A little context: I work at a medium size (30) company as an area leader. In the last two years the company has grown a lot, specially my area, causing that a lot of the know how in my area is concentrated in me, as I was the only one in the area three years ago, thus I know the entire procedures and are really efficient.

Last week I took a week free after a couple of very stressing months full of workload, with extra projects added with very short deadlines that we, after putting a ton of overhours, somehow managed to finish.

Last sunday I went to this event in an open venue in my town and met my boss there, after greeting me he started asking if my colleagues knew everything they needed to know to keep working on the project. I wanted to be polite, so I told him that we made a meeting ir order to transfer the status and goals for the projects for this week, hoping to close the conversation there. He then kept asking me things about the project, and if there were still unanswered questions, to what I replied ""if there were, then I could answer them after my holidays"". He didn't like my answer at all and said something along the lines of ""that isn't the right answer"", so I immediately replied that I was on my free time so it was the only answer he was getting from me.

I really wanted to disconnect from work and be able to rest and I don't even have a contract, nor a payroll that makes me be reachable. On the other hand some people told me I am the asshole for not remaining reachable during my holidays, knowing my position in the company.


AITA for not wanting to discuss about work during my free time?

Earlier today, I received a text from my father asking me if I could help him and my little sister empty the car once they get back from the grocery store, I agree, and he says that he texted me two minutes before arriving so that I can be ready when they arrive. As I have more important things to do, I tell him that I won’t get down now, and will do so when they get home.

More or less 10 minutes later, he texts me saying that they will arriving in two minutes, and starts writing another text. No thinking much, I wait for him to send it. It takes him a long time to write it, and it says that they are here. I write a single 3 to finish my exercise and head downstairs.

The reach the house as I am putting my second shoe on, and my father is extremely angry, saying things like « of course, you couldn’t be ready 30 seconds earlier! » and « letting ice cream on the sidewalk, amazing idea! » Since they took an Uber and he had to leave, they let the extra food on the sidewalk. I walk outside and take bags until my hands are full, they take what’s left and we all head inside and in the kitchen. 

My father continues to express his discontentment, and I try to explain him how I did nothing wrong, which only makes him angrier, insulting me all while I start to empty the bags of food. He then tells me to leave and go back to my room to “study or something” I go back to the front of the house to remove my shoes, all while he continues to say how I am wrong for thinking I did nothing wrong, and that of course I know it, since I know everything. I’m annoyed by him rn so I ask him impatiently if he wants to talk about it, to which he responds no, so I tell him to stop talking about it.

I then go back in my rom to continue studying.

c1fw7q	2019-06-16 22:32:03	sina182	AITA for getting upset about the way my brother’s girlfriend spoke to me?	"It was my mom‘s birthday and we had been celebrating with friends and family the whole day.

My partner (25), my brother (24), his girlfriend (24) and I (27) decided to play a round of Catan at 0.30 am. My brother was quite drunk, my partner was buzzed and me and brother’s girlfriend Lisa were sober.

My mom’s friend Anna asked if I could give her a ride once we were done - of course. 

So we played for more than 1.5 hrs, when we reached a point in the game were everybody was close to winning. However, for several reasons it wasn’t possible for two players to get more points. I suggested we stop playing as it was getting late and I wanted to get Anna home. People at that point just ignored it. 

We continued for a bit when my partner explained that he was not able to gain more points and him and I suggested that maybe it was better to finish now. When it was my turn I put my cards down and said I was more than happy to leave all my things on the board, but that I’d rather drive Anna home now and they could finish. 

That’s when Lisa completely snapped at me saying things like ‘you’re only doing this because you’re not winning this time’ and ‘next time I’ll just get up and quit when you’re winning’. Not that it matters, but I was closest to winning and i really couldn’t care less. I just wanted to get to bed and drive Anna home. I expressed that, but Lisa just kept repeating childish accusations, so I said fine I’ll play then till we’re done. 

I kept picking up cards and then just passed the dice on. My mom returned to the table and she asked how it was going. Lisa said ‘it’s going as well as it can when one person stops playing properly’. And that’s when I asked her what her problem was and why she was making such a big deal out of it. That it was late and that I had said several times that I would rather drop Anna off now as she was ready to go home. Well Lisa would not drop it. She kept attacking me, kept talking about me like I wasn’t there, which is just disrespectful. My mom then suggested we finish and eventually brother and Lisa agreed.

I then drove Anna home and when I came back my brother and Lisa had left. 

I feel stupid about this whole disagreement, but I am also not ok with the way she spoke to me - regardless of the game setting. I expected to hear from her today, but nothing. I would like to resolve this, but I am not ok with just ‘forgetting about it and letting it go and look it it as just a game’ like my mother suggested.

Lisa and I are very different people, but I have been making an effort to bond with her. I definitely do not consider us close enough for her to speak to me that way. 

I thought I’d just wait it out and see what happens. But I am honestly worried that this stupid evening will harm the relationship my partner and I have with my brother and Lisa."	Not the A-hole	0	0	26.0	16.0	0.0	0.0

There’s a friend of hers who flirts with her on the regular via text, messenger, etc. It’s cool because it’s the relationship they had in high school.

I don’t control her and I don’t want to control her. I don’t care that she maintains this flirtatious relationship (because that’s the dynamic they had). The only thing I want is for her to stop airing our issues because of the weird flirtatious relationship they have.


Before it’s asked: we live a state apart from him but he has jokingly asked for her to move in with him.

c1fvkc	2019-06-16 22:30:14	izlib	AITA for resorting to throwing a temper tantrum over microwaved fish in the office?	"TLDR: People microwave fish at work. It smells really bad and I have a reaction to it. I cannot comfortably work in this environment. Talking to the individual hasn't helped, neither has talking to management. I've done some passive aggressive things out of frustration since then. It's a small office and there's nowhere I can move that will avoid the smell.

*********************************

Some clarifications

It's a small office. I can move desks technically, but 10 feet doesn't really avoid the smell. There are no windows.

My regrettable actions involving my passive-aggressive approach was done long after other appropriate actions were taken with no successful change. It absolutely wasn't my first approach.

*********************************

I work in a small office and my work space is right next to the break room. We have a few people who microwave fish regularly, 3-4 times a week.

I have a personal aversion to seafood, but I try to not let that affect what other people eat around me. I’ll go to seafood restaurants with friends and just order something else, for example.

But the stuff they microwave at work is rank. It permeates through the HVAC and sticks in the air for over an hour. It is nauseating and it’s caused me to leave the office or else I’d be throwing up at my desk.

It has been my opinion that microwaving fish is a big social faux pas, and that I would have somewhat stronger support from my co-workers in voicing my complaints on this matter.

I have tried the following:
Politely talking to the offending parties about the problem.
Offering alternatives (fish meals that can be eaten cold).
Asking them to limit it to days I am in the field, which is usually 2-3 days a week. That sort of worked, except he still does it on days that I’m there, and tells me he’s about to make his lunch with the expectation that I leave, or that I deal with it.

In all these cases I was led to believe that I was being unreasonable for my request.

I tried talking to management about it. They pretty much shrugged their shoulders because there is no real rule they can enforce, and the other guy is kind of a personality where they don’t care to interfere with him.

The only thing they have done is to enforce that the break room door stay closed, then washed their hands of it and declared problem solved. Well when it gets sucked up into the HVAC and dumped right over my desk I don’t think it helps. If anything now it keeps the smell bottled up longer instead of at least dissipating out into the hallways quicker.

So I’ve resorted to public shaming by passive aggressive notes in our company chat, but I get reprimanded for doing so. Now I just spray a whole can of febreeze around the office to try to clear the smell, but honestly it’s also to try to smoke out the offenders with an otherwise equally offensive smell.

Am I the asshole? Am I out of touch? Is microwaving fish in the office something that I should just suffer to be OK with? I’d have hoped that this guy would be a bit more sympathetic to my requests as they functionally got peanuts banned from the office due to his own issues.

I’ve now pretty much just taken every excuse to avoid coming into the office and working from my remote client locations longer than I’d necessary."	Asshole	0	0	2940.0	51.0	0.0	0.0

I never spoke a word to him again and I’m 28 now. Relatives of mine have updated me on him over the years even though I asked them not too, so I knew he had been sick over the past few years but he never reached out to me, neither did my stepmother or 2 half siblings. I just found out that he passed away a few days ago and everyone is telling me I’m “cold” because I’m not upset/sad at all and haven’t shed a tear about this, I feel completely indifferent about it. I’m being pressured to reach out to his family and to go to his funeral, but I don’t want to at all, they had 14 years to reach out and no one did. Does this make me an asshole?

c1fqpw	2019-06-16 22:17:30	gentrifycoffeetables	AITA for asking for space from my best friend?	"
This January, my best friend and her boyfriend broke up because he thought they both had to work on their mental health. He told her there was a chance of them getting back together. I supported her through her heartbreak and she vented to me often and she also posted a lot on her private instagram. This continued for the next few months and worsened when he got a new girlfriend. She facetimed me sobbing at her prom because she saw them together and I tried to comfort her as best I could. 

The aftermath of their breakup lasted five months. Throughout it, and she posted on her priv insta how sad she was about him ending things. He texted her this month telling her that he wanted nothing to do with her and she was manipulative and that her posts caused strangers to hate him. At this point she got angry with him and decided she was over him completely. I informed her I wasn’t going to be very free the next few weeks because of finals.

A week goes by and she texts me telling me she wants to tell me all about this new boy she’s into. I ignored it and then a couple days later once my finals were over, I texted her saying I needed space because I felt she had dragged out her breakup for so long and she had hurt people in the process including me. I tried to help her and she hadn’t listened, & after seeing her obsess over this new boy I felt that she was dependent on other people for happiness. I still loved her but i just needed a break. She texted back “Okay.”

A few hours later she put on her priv insta how 9 years of friendship had gone down the drain and she didn’t think she could find anyone who would accept her and how she needed to disappear for a while. I replied & said I just needed space, and she told me that’s exactly what her ex had said & it felt the same. I told her it wasn’t but if she felt that way then I understood.

The next day she texted me saying she was sorry for getting upset, she just felt like I was siding with her ex, & that I was allowed to take my break. I told her I didn’t side with him, I just felt during the breakup she didn’t care about or notice the emotional burden I was taking on whenever she vented to me. She told me if I didn’t want her to vent I never should have asked and I said I’m going to check up on my friends if they are sad, I felt obligated to even though I shouldn’t, but I need boundaries because I have my own issues she never asks about. She told me don’t check up on her, her stuff doesn’t matter, and that we have different ideas of what a friend is so we should find people who fit. I told her if she didn’t want to be friends anymore then tell me soon, and I wasn’t going to be seen as a villain for expressing to her what I felt and have been feeling for a while. She told me we should take a break from being friends for the summer and I agreed.

c1fq2r	2019-06-16 22:15:51	GlandLocks	AITA for using the disabled bathroom and saying I'd park in a disabled spot if it weren't illegal?	"25F. Yesterday, I got the entire toenail on my left big toe surgically removed. The actual operation was the most painful thing I have ever experienced, and the subsequent pain yesterday and today has been pretty bad, even with painkillers. I have a massive bandage on my toe, meaning I have to wear flip-flops (even though it's cool and rainy here in the UK right now), because the bandage won't fit in any closed-toe shoes. I'm limping and walking very slowly (it took us about 3 times as long as normal to get everywhere today, so I guess I'm walking 3 times slower than normal). Walking is very painful, every step sends a shooting pain up through my foot. So I'm trying to do as little walking as possible.

Today, as I do every Sunday, I went out with my boyfriend (James) and our mutual friend (Mark) to the cinema, then the pub, then a restaurant. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have planned to do that the day after my surgery, but honestly I feel my podiatrist really downplayed the seriousness of the procedure (either that or my pain threshold is very low), so I really didn't think I'd be in much pain today or struggling to walk. I used the disabled toilet at the cinema and the restaurant, because the disabled toilet was closer to our seats than the ladies. At the pub, the ladies was closer than the disabled, so I used the ladies. I did this solely (ha, pun intended) because walking is painful, difficult and time consuming, so the less distance I have to walk, the better.

I normally drive, but my podiatrist advised me not to drive for a week, so my boyfriend James drove today. I said to my friend Mark that I wish it weren't illegal to park in disabled spaces so that we could park in one today. Again, this is simply because walking is very difficult and painful and slow for me, and the disabled spaces are closer to where we were going than the regular spaces. To be very clear, we DIDN'T park in a disabled space (we weren't going to risk the fine). But I just said I wished we could.

Mark then said that I was an arsehole for using the disabled toilets and for saying I would park in a disabled space if I could, because I'm not disabled, I'm just temporarily injured. Coincidentally, we saw a man with a broken leg walking around on crutches, and I asked Mark if he should be allowed to use the disabled bathroom and disabled parking spaces while his leg is healing. Mark said no. He said the disabled toilets and parking spaces are made for disabled people who struggle with lifelong conditions, not for able-bodied people who are injured for a couple of months.

At first I thought it was pretty clear cut, but now I'm doubting myself because I don't really know any disabled people and I'm not sure how they feel about temporarily injured people using facilities that were designed to make their long-term disabilities easier to deal with. To be clear, I didn't keep any disabled people waiting or anything. So, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	446.0	32.0	0.0	0.0

Instead he put in all his clothes at once, made the washer break down, and my mom had to fix it for half an hour. I’m not sure he knows this as he just dropped his clothes off and went to run errands.

My mom left and told me not to forget to put his clothes in the dryer. I was babysitting and making dinner so of course, I forgot and didn’t put them in until ten minutes until my brother came back to get them (I had no idea when he’d be back though) so they were still wet. 

He packed them up, called us all names, and stormed out. 

I have a feeling I’m gonna get yelled at when my mom comes home because I forgot. He makes more money than both of us combined, I don’t know why he can’t buy his own, or why he couldn’t have waited til they were dry, but this could’ve been avoided if I didn’t forget.

"Recently I (17) got into my first fender bender and rear ended someone, At first I was really scared but luckily the lady I hit was understanding and sympathetic. The damage on her car was minimal but it was still an expensive car nonetheless. One phone call later my mom shows up and they both agreed that they wouldn't get insurance involved and we would just pay the auto-body bill. Fast forward and the bill comes to $3,600.

My mom paid all of it since I didn't have money but expected me to pay her back in full. She wanted to take 100% of my checks but I knew that wasn't fair so we agreed on 50%. At first I didn't mind at all because I was the one responsible for the accident in the first place. But then I talked with some friends parents and they all seem to agree that my mom should be responsible for at least half of the bill especially since I'm not 18 yet. If my mom was struggling with money I still would've wanted to pay her back in full, but currently she has 3 renters living at our house paying $400 a month with her boyfriend paying the house's rent. She also has a job.

During this time I was in highschool and I worked as a custodian for 1.3 hours a day at $11.85 an hour, obviously I've picked up more hours and have Graduated highschool since then. Am I the asshole for wanting a little help?

c1fopr	2019-06-16 22:12:12	I_dont_agree_with_me	AITA for wanting to put my tinder match on ice while on holiday with my family	"  

Matched with a guy on Tinder on Thursday, he seems decent so I tell him I'm going out of the country for two weeks on holiday on Monday but ask him if we can meet up before then. He's busy this weekend, but says we can meet up when I get back.

I have in my bio that I'm extremely introverted and pretty much socially reclusive (not socially awkward though, I just really like being alone, a lot), he says that's fine, that he gets it and he doesn't like small talk either. He tells me he's looking for somebody to date seriously, I tell him that I'm looking for something casual but I'm open to long-term if things work out, he says casual is fine. I tell him at the start I prefer not to have a drawn out texting situation before meeting somebody.

We talk a little bit more over the weekend, mostly about his new fitness venture. We switch to whatsapp because he prefers to leave voice messages, he tries to get me to reply with voice messages too but I stick to text after giving it a go and hating it (I'm self conscious about my voice). 

I text him today that while I'm on holiday I'm not likely to reply to his texts, since I'll be on holiday with four of my siblings, and I'm almost certain I'll be too tired and busy to continue a conversation and I'll be lucky to still have my sanity at the end (I really love them, but I'm used to being alone and while it's going to be a lot of fun, I'm going to trapped in a car with five adults for 2+ hours at a time and I'm going to be bunking with my sisters every night for the 2 weeks).

He asks if I'm joking and I tell him I just want to concentrate on the family holiday I've been planning for the last few weeks and if he's still interested in meeting up when I get back to text me but it's cool if he not. He leaves a voice message telling me that I'm showing an enormous lack of respect expecting him to wait two weeks to talk again and that the early days of a relationship are vital. He then tells me that he was fine with me being taller than him since he likes tall girls that he could tell himself that me being socially withdrawn just meant I was more interesting than most normal girls ,and he even found the fact I'm self-conscious about my voice endearing but he couldn't accept being treated this way, that it killed any attraction he had to me. At the end of his message he then makes a remark that he hopes that being forced to spend so much time with my family might actually do me some good  Immediately after he leaves that message he un-matches me on tinder and blocks me on whatsapp so I can’t reply. While I'm pretty sure I dodged a bullet here from his final comments, I am left wondering if I'm the asshole in this situation for wanting to put things on ice."	Not the A-hole	0	0	77.0	16.0	0.0	0.0
c1fohx	2019-06-16 22:11:38	RecoveringGrocer	AITA for leaving a wedding before the bride and groom cut the cake?	"Yesterday, my fiance and I went to a wedding in the middle-of-no-where NJ for a work friend of mine. It was a traditional Catholic wedding that involved a long mass, followed by a two-hour break and then a reception at an alternate location. My fiance and I live about an hour away and have an 8 month old puppy at home that we hired a dog sitter for and were trying to be conscious of time so that the dog wasn't home alone for too long. Our plan was to leave at around 10pm (about an hour early of the scheduled end time of the wedding).

&#x200B;

The timing of the wedding was pretty slow, and our dinner was only served at 9pm. At around 9:15pm my friend expressed anxiety about getting back to the hotel to be with her husband and 6 week old baby. She was out for the first time since giving birth and despite leaving her husband with adequate breast milk, she was feeling anxious to get back to them. I told her we would drive her back to the hotel when we leave at 10. She said she wanted to get home sooner than that so I agreed to leave at 9:30. 

&#x200B;

By the time we rolled out the cake hadn't been cut.

"I love my mother, shes an amazing hard working woman who's worked since she was 6 years old. And didnt even attend middle school in order to help provide for her family.  But all of this has really taken a toll on her. my father is on disability due to a trucking accident and has been somewhat disabled for about 10 years now .

And this is the year he's finally going to get a whole hip replacement. Lately my mother has been very irritable when shes overworked and snaps at my dad when he asks for something.  See, he cant walk very much and has to have everything handed to him at dinner and breakfast and has to have a lot of menial things done for him which either I or my mom end up doing for him . I don't mind as I see the situation for what it is but my mom has been snapping at him for it lately . Asking him things like ""is that all?""  ""Do I have to do everything for you?""  And shit like that . 

So we're having breakfast this morning and she snaps at him again with something along those lines and I told her ""yknow, I'm pretty sure he'd rather be doing all of these things for himself instead of having you throw it in his face. Dont you think he wishes he could walk normally again ? ""  , I didnt mean it maliciously its just that my father is a very proud man, and has always been a do-it yourself guy . She didnt say anything she just kind of looked down sadly in contemplation and things have been normal all day but my dad said I shouldve just let it be.

They have equal custody and both live about 30 mins away from each other. My dad has a fiance and is getting married in August. Anyways, I usually switch houses every Friday, but I stayed with my dad this weekend because this was Fathers Day weekend. 
Anyways, I've been working long hours all weekend at work and kinda wanted to just stay home one more night and relax without having to worry about packing things up and driving to my mom's. I asked my mom if she was fine with this and she said sure. I asked my dad about this and he said that he had actually asked tomorrow off to spend time with my future step mom (I'll call her step mom to make it easier) because they haven't had a lot of alone time together and wanted some alone time tonight and tomorrow. Theyve been planning a wedding while also trying to sell our house and buy a new one. He said he was fine with me staying, but I could tell that he actually wanted me to leave. 
I understood what he wanted and said I would just go ahead and pack up and it really wouldn't be any problem. He then immediately said he felt terrible and said I could stay
So I know this is a bit of a different question then the usually in this sub, but is he the asshole? (IHTA)

TL:DR - I asked my dad if I could stay another night at his place instead of going to my moms because I was tired and lazy, he asked me to leave because he had planned a romantic night and morning with his fiance, I said sure thing and he said he felt really bad about asking that."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1ffdk	2019-06-16 21:48:29	Piff_Lee	AITA for not splitting parking tickets with my girlfriend?	"A little context. 

I live in the city with my girlfriend. My dad has an old crappy van which I borrow in the summer as Me and my girlfriend like to get out of the city a lot in the summer— especially with a dog the car is crucial to doing the things in the summer we like to do (beach, home, etc). It would be impossible to do these without a car so there is no doubt the mutual need for this car is. 

We use the van completely even. 75% of weekends we are using it together. The other 25% either she will use it to go somewhere or I will. It really is complete even usage. 

We don’t pay for parking as it’s expensive so we move it 2-3 times a week to avoid street cleaning. Recently she parked too close to a fire hydrant and got around $250 in tickets. 

I said I wasn’t splitting it with her as we both take turns parking the car and as this wasn’t a freak accident (she just didn’t check the area enough) it is her responsibility. Just as I would pay for any ticket I got while I was parking it. I personally take extreme caution to avoid tickets (double checking areas, skipping spots that probably are good but are on the edge of too close to fire hydrants) so it doesn’t make sense for me to split it with her as she choose not to do that. 

Her and her friends seem to think as technically it is “my car” I should have split the tickets.

Though to be honest I’ve always been the selfless one in the relationship where he has always been more selfish . But anyways he is finally getting married. We’ve always talked about how we would be one another’s best man since we were kids. As I don’t have a lot of friends this is probably the only chance I’ll ever have to be in a wedding so I was super excited! 

As the wedding was being planned his wife wanted only family to stand up with them at their wedding. He calls and explains that he can’t have me be the best man or in the wedding at all because of this. But makes a comment about how he’d better still be my best man. While I really was disappointed I took it in stride and said that was fine, and I’d still be there to support them on their special day. 

Well today he calls and tells me what time to be there for the ceremony and right away I can tell somethings off. Turns out his friend of a couple years is really sick and might not be around a super long time so they have asked him to be in the wedding party... AITA for being pissed about this?

With my cat, I follow the vet’s food intake recommendation to a T, feeding her about 1/4 cup of food twice a day. Her weight fluctuates, which is normal, but she always stayed around 7 pounds, a healthy weight for a small-ish female cat. My roommate’s cat, however, was overweight when he was adopted and is still overweight. We’re not talking huge, but he weighs about 15 lbs when he should weigh 10-12, according to the vet. He’s otherwise healthy and happy. I don’t think my roommate intentionally overfeeds him or anything, and he’s a very well-taken care of pet as a whole. Just a chunky boy who could afford to lose a few. 

My roommate is going away for a few months and has asked me to take care of his kitty while he’s away. I immediately jumped on this as the perfect opportunity to tackle the weight issue and get him on a regimented diet, with the thought in mind that I’ll teach my roommate the new feeding pattern when he returns. I’m not talking anything drastic, either. I’d be feeding him the same exact food my roommate already buys for him, just keeping better track of how much he’s being fed and when. 

I haven’t asked my roommate about this yet, but I did tell a friend and she said that it wasn’t okay since he wasn’t my cat, and that I should continue to feed him the same amount my roommate was. WIBTA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"My girlfriend’s college female housemate (Amy) will be out of the country for a couple weeks. Amy asked my girlfriend if it’s okay if her brother who is about the same age as them stay at their place for a week because he is on a business trip in the city and this will be a free option instead of paying for a hotel.

I told her I was uncomfortable with another man staying in the same house as my girlfriend, and she says she will feel bad going back on the decision.  I understand that she already told them yes so said I will offer to help pay for a portion of his hotel.  My girlfriend seems pretty upset overall though for having to tell them no, so I’m not sure if I’m handling this situation correctly.

EDIT:  Thank you for the comments so far.  I was afraid I’m coming off as controlling and will re-evaluate myself.  I do want to add that I trust my girlfriend completely, I’m just afraid that neither of us have ever met this man before and there’s nothing stopping him from taking advantage of the situation.

In my mid-20s, his late teens, I *tried* to do things with him: nights out, meals, movies, shopping, hiking, sports you name it--and 99% of the time I would be turned down *and trolled.* Not only would he decline, but he would criticize that event and hurl personal insults my way. 

During this online gaming phase of his, he was *unbearable:* snotty remarks, fight picking, loud 3 AM gaming sessions when I had to be up at sunrise for work or class, taking things of mine without asking, returning borrowed items in awful conditions, and so on. Almost every night I would be woken up with screams and yelling, I'd tell him to keep it down (only for him to apologize and do it again the following night) and would have to go work an eight hour shift or spend the majority of the following day at school. This is why I continued living at home. I suspect he picked these behaviors up from the online community of friends he gamed with, my parents's narcissism (anger, shaming, negativity, your run-of-the-mill manipulation), and dealing with bullies at school.

I am bitter because, during this phase, he repeatedly mocked me for seeking relationships and wanting to move out of the house. He would say things like, ""Women are whores, they'll just drain your bank accounts"" and ""We live in a nice house! Moving would be stupid."" (I like the house we live in, but I have a lot of resentment towards my family.) Please keep in mind that I had tolerated this snotty and sexist behavior, and displacement (making me the target of his problems) for **years.** In his defense, he has tried to apologize for this via text, but my patience has been sapped. 

_Fast forward five years later..._ he's outgoing, mellowed-out, has been dating someone for a couple of years, and rarely spends time at home. I find this all very ironic and, if I'm honest with myself, I'm jealous because I am alone.

Anyway, they will eventually marry, but all of that backstory to say I no longer care for my brother or my family at all. During the years he and I would joust, I tried to keep cool and give him the benefit of the doubt, but I guess all of that wear-and-tear has made me callous. I feel nothing for them now; there is no motivation to rectify our relationships. I have had it.

And one of my friends was talking to one of the girls and was like yeah my friend likes you he might try and kiss you at the party and that was it I was even there (yes it was awkward).

Last night I received a long paragraph from a completely different girl saying I was vile and disgusting and insulting how I look and how I act I was very confused and tried to stop a response from this girl on why I was vile and I could not get a straight answer.

I woke up in the morning to other message from other girls saying the same thing. This girl thank fully gave me an answer and said that she heard from the person we were originally talking to that I was planning on getting these girls drunk and then kissing them in this party this was obviously not the case and I explained to them that even I though that comment was disgusting but they were not believing me. 

I had to get my friend involved and tell these girls that I never said these comments and neither did he.

After 5 hours(Long conversation trying to clear my name) the 2 girls who were accusing me sent me 2 apologies at the same time saying they got misinformation.

I replied back “Thanks for the apologies but do us both a favour and fuck off”. I was very hurt by the accusations but after I told them that they went straight back to insulting me.

So I am thinking should of I just accepted the apologies and moved on or did I react accordingly.

So my ex has been hitting up my phone for some time now wanting us to get back together.

There's a lot of context here that I'm not going to mention to focus on the now.

Earlier in the week she called and we had what I would've hoped was a normal conversation only to have her ending it with ""we had a life together and we could've still been together, blah blah blah""

Friday came and I messaged her saying ""Hey, it's Friday, let's hangout""

After choosing a place to meet and such she suggested a time of 6 pm.

I suggested 7 even tho I would prefer 8 so that she would be able to go home and get herself together.

Her response was ""so that means I gotta go home and take a bath?""

I had a momentary fit.

""Bitch, the fuck you mean?..."" Were among the few choice responses that came to mind but didn't send.

After I gathered my thoughts I responded with 
""You're right. This was a bad idea. Forget it""

She called me sometime later asking for a reschedule to the next day, Saturday. I told her that I would think about it.

In truth, I had already lost interest.

I usually chill on Saturdays, go see a movie and enjoy a nice slice of Oreo cheesecake.

So that's just what I did.

An hour before the movie starts she messages me ""Hey""

So I responded with ""today's not gonna happen. Bout to see a movie in an hour""

A small part of me wanted to invite her but I didn't. I just didn't want anyone fucking up my vibe.

She never responded but I can't help feel like I may have been an asshole, even just a little bit.

I think she has now blocked me on the app but knowing her she's just upset and will be back.

A few months back, I had new neighbours move in next door and ever since we've had a lot of trouble in what used to be a nice, quiet lane. They like to blast insanely loud music at all hours of the day and have late night arguments in the lane where everyone can here them. They're just overall not very nice to live next to.

Last week we had a fire at the bottom of our lane, so the bin men weren't able to get down it to empty the bins. I called the council and they said as long as the lane is still blocked off by the police, there's nothing they can do in regards to emptying them.

Now when I put my bin out 3 days ago, it was near enough empty, it had maybe 2 bags in it. It's a jumbo size bin that takes out 10 bags to fill up properly. Earlier on I went to collect it in (since the council said that the earliest they could come and collect would be early next week) and it's completely over flowing with rubbish! Empty cans, pop bottles, pizza boxes, black bags and loads more. There's also more bags stacked around my bin. 

There's even burn marks in the top and sides of the bin where they've used it to put out their cigarettes! Now my council refuses to take bins away if the lids can't be closed and will charge you if you need it to be taken away separately or on a different day, they'll also refuse to take it if there's bags on the ground next to it. I've looked over at my neighbours bin, had a look inside and it's full, but not over flowing, so it would be taken away.

I went over and knocked on her door to ask why she's used my bin, I could see a TV on through the window and hear music playing, but noone answered. So I put on a pair of rubber gloves, and the took all her rubbish out and put it her garden and on top of her bin.

My other half says I'm being petty and should have just left it, but I'm not willing to be charged to have my bin taken away when it's her rubbish, AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	166.0	55.0	0.0	0.0
c1f5ll	2019-06-16 21:23:54	Lynneus	AITA I won't participate in church	"My elderly father moved in with me over a year ago due to health problems. He can no longer drive, but he was very active in his church, so I drive him to his church every week.  His church is 60 miles away from my house, so it's a 120 mile round trip every Sunday. 

&#x200B;

I am an atheist,  so I politely refrain from participating in the service.  I don't stand for readings, sing songs, take communion, or give to the offering plate.  I sit in the pew, put in my earbuds and listen to music or podcasts at a moderate volume so as not to disturb others. I would just drop my dad off, and go get some coffee, but he needs assistance getting in and out of the aisles, stowing his walker, and getting around in general.  So there I sit. 

&#x200B;

My son says that I am being disrespectful by not participating because, ""I'm in their house.""  I disagree. I do not share their beliefs or values. In fact, I despise almost everything they believe in, but I am willing to make the long drive each week so my father can participate.  I am quiet and polite while attending.  I say hello to his friends, shake hands, chit-chat, etc. But I don't feel that I am obligated to participate in the service.  I am simply the chauffer/assistant. Is my son right? Am I the asshole?"

"I was hanging out with a couple friends lately and me and my friends are no strangers to fucking with each other and saying mean shit. My friend who is a little meaner than the others for no apparent reason just said “your short because your a failed abortion” and proceeded to laugh.


Usually I would come back with some witty comment or laugh to but It was so out of the blue and it had triggered something in me for some reason. As we were leaving the store we were in I said something about his dad who recently passed away. I don’t remember as I was pretty annoyed at the time. He got pissed and left later.

I felt bad but what he said to me was so out of the fucking blue, nothing leading up to it. Me and my friend both said as he was leaving how fucking random it was.

Edit kinda: he did apologize as I was typing this and realized he said it with no context, my friend was also a sociopath and never really feels emotion for other people, displaying very little when his dad died. He said he is going to try and change.

My friend saw, leaked the images to me, I leaked them to her cousin, and he told her mom. Her mom told the girl and there's a ton of drama in the family around her now. Anyway, she messaged my friend and they argued. I'll call them Thot and Good Boy (she's a female boy). Good Boy says that it's wrong to be posting herself doing illegal things.

Thot is like ""it's not illegal because of this excuse"" or something like that. Good Boy and Thot argue for a while, Thot says I've been talking behind Good Boy's back, Good Boy says to leave me out of it (Thot does not know I told her cousin about it, she only brings me up because she dislikes me).

Thot explains that she hated me, she now hates Good Boy, and that I always kept lying and ridiculing Good Boy behind her back (I did not do this, in fact, I barely talked to Thot). Good Boy asks her for an example, Thot basically says ""fuck off"" and stuff happens. Now, the part I'd like to know is, would I be an asshole for provoking an argument between us? I have her number and Instagram. If I sent her some random emoji, a comment about her lying, or just some meme about a thot, would I be an asshole?

Td;lr: Thot takes pictures of herself, doing illegal things, puts them on Snapchat, I leak them to her cousin, she's pissed at my friend, tells her she hates both her and I. Would I be the asshole if I were to send her message to provoke an argument, or should I stay out of this?

&#x200B;

Edit: Okay, for clarification: My other post was removed, I cannot discuss what she put on her story, but I did not want her to be harmed by any person who saw it and tried to meet up with her or something. Friend contacted the police, I told her cousin because that's the only family member I can message. I will not message her. Thank you for the answers. Also, she didn't like smoke weed or anything, it's a federal crime I'm pretty sure. Friend told the police, so it was reported."	Asshole	0	0	20.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

c1f22c	2019-06-16 21:15:04	worrieddad2019	AITA for ‘stalking’ my daughter?	"My daughter is 14 years old and is my and my wife’s only child. Shes just getting to that age where she wants to go out on Friday and Saturday nights to hang out in the town centre/ go to arcades/ shop/ etc with her group of friends, all of whom are good kids. 

We live in a small town and most parents will actually also convene in the centre where there plenty open air restaurants/ fountains etc so it’s not uncommon to see families drive in and split up with the teen kids hanging out while the rest wine and dine. 

It’s a fairly safe town but as any small town, the creeps are CREEPS and our town has a decent percentage of out of towners come through at any given time due to our proximity to the beach. 

My daughter is incredibly beautiful and it pains me to say she’s been the target for losers harassing her plenty of times over the years. A creep approached my wife when my daughter was 4 and tried to buy her. When she was out with her cousin when she was 12 a man tried to grab her. I’ve been out with her and seen grown ass men approach her bravely like she isn’t a goddamn kid and so naturally I and my wife are very cautious and have spoken to her regarding personal safety. 

Last Friday rolls around and she wanted to go out wearing attire that whilst I wouldn’t describe as scandalous AT ALL, it’s what all goddamn teens wear, made me concerned for her safety. My wife and I had planned to meet her folks for dinner anyway so we took her into town with us and after asking her where she’d be (at the bubble tea place) we sat down to have dinner. 

All of our businesses and stores are basically
clustered together so after dinner was finished but before we moved onto drinks I briefly told my wife I was going to check in on our kid and I walked over to the store, stuck my neck in to see if she was ok. She looked up and saw me, seemed happy to see me and asked if I wanted to try her tea flavor, and all was well so I walked back to my wife and in laws. 

The reason why I didn’t call or text was because my kid always has her phone on silent and more often than not won’t reply til hours later, which I’m assuming is a universal teen thing. 

My MIL was less than impressed and basically told
me I was being an overbearing father and that I need
to give my daughter breathing space. My wife interjected and told her mom that we support and love our kid and would never stop her from living her life, but if we are in the area of course we’ll use it to our advantage to periodically check that she’s safe. 

To be clear, we know we can’t always protect our kid, but we have had enough bad experiences with men being predators that we feel we owe it to her to try and always do what we can."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Three days ago, he was upset because I was late answering him, he wrote ""Ugh, you disconnected again"" to that point I already answered him for education, so I saw the opportunity and I answered ""Is the little boy angry?""

c1f0rg	2019-06-16 21:11:51	erzebetta	AITA For not letting my boyfriend borrow my new car?	"Today there are some pretty strong pop-up thunderstorms where we live. We were just in *his* car (which he’s treated horribly) at one of his weekend soccer matches. We got soaked, & his brother, him and I headed back home so he could change clothes & drive to his next game 30 mins away. 

I was about to shower after the deluge earlier when he approached me in the hallway & said, “Baby I really hate to ask but could we please borrow your car to go to the next game? The windows get foggy in mine.”

I was faced with my moral conundrum. There’s a bad history with him borrowing my car—the one I had before the one I have now. He was pulled over for speeding, has no drivers license, which led to it being towed and him been sent in jail for not having ID (He & his bro are immigrants from Central America & have had to wait a while to get permission to take driver’s test etc). He used to borrow it to go soccer & I would let him. W/ him borrowing old car, leather seats tore up in the front. He would put his cleats on on the passenger side sometimes and he scratched up the glove box. He also ate in it a lot and got food stains up where the visor is that never came out. 

We have been together for 4 years & he’s never helped me pay for my car or for the insurance.
A few months ago, I traded my car in & got one I really wanted-a Mercedes. Since I got it, I haven’t been keen on letting him borrow it. I think he’s borrowed it twice. I don’t want him driving it without having his license unless I’m with him so it wouldn’t get towed. His brother doesn’t have his drivers license fully yet. In the past, I was always trying to be nice and helpful but ended up just getting my car treated like crap. Now I’ve developed a lot of boundaries.

He left the house fuming, saying things about not wanting to mess up my “precious car”. I was trying to tell him there’s lots of risk with him & his brother driving it + if anything were to happen I have a $1000 insurance deductible. Also, I’m tired & I wasn’t ready to just hop in my car and escort him to another game 30 minutes away.

It may not seem like a big deal to him, but these 4 years I have *worked* to be able to buy myself a car that I was super happy with. I don’t want the interior to be messed up. I don’t want ripped seats after a year or scratches/scuffs/scars inside of it that are unnecessary-or food stains. I don’t want to call the Houston PD & have to hunt down my car to where it was towed because he was speeding & then pay the $200 to get it out. I don’t want anything like that to happen to me again. It wasn’t an emergency. He plays for several teams on the wknds for cash & it’s not like he’d be losing a huge opportunity, it’s not like someone needed to go to the ER."

c1f0m7	2019-06-16 21:11:29		AITA for cutting off my friend for frequently bailing on plans?	"I have a friend of 8 years now (Victoria) who I recently got into a huge fight with because we made plans and she bailed last minute on me.

Background: 

We met in high school when we were both 17. I am 24 now, and she is 23. We have been through a lot together. Our friendship has had ups and downs, weird points of sexual interactions, and a lot of emotions, but we somehow always find our way back to each other.

She now has a 5 year old son and travels frequently for work, to the point that at any given time during a particular week, I probably wouldn’t know if she’s in town. She generally leaves her son with her mom when she goes on trips. We generally hang out once each week she’s home.

In the past few months, there were 3 incidents where we made plans and Victoria ended up bailing either by completely ghosting, or by keeping me on the hook until last minute, in which case I made other plans (and was called “insensitive” for doing so).

Last week, my friend Danielle invited me to hang out with her and her boyfriend at the beach. I also have a sexual history with Danielle (very recently too - we had been sleeping together the past couple months), and didn’t feel 100% comfortable third-wheeling with her and her brand new boyfriend.

I asked Victoria if she would want to come hang out with us so that I would not have to third wheel, and going to the beach at night was a pastime of ours growing up. She originally said no because she had work the next morning. I asked if the next night would be more convenient.

I called Danielle and her boyfriend, and we rescheduled to the next night so that Victoria could go.

The next night, I text Victoria confirming our plans. She agrees, and tells me to pick out a specific liquor at the liquor store. We were set to leave at 8. 

I leave the liquor store with the Malibu Victoria requested. 7:50 comes around and I ask her to be at my place by 8 so we can leave. 

Victoria: Negative. I’m putting my son to sleep right now. He wants me to read to him.

Me: Okay, just come as soon as possible.

Another 20 minutes passes.

Victoria: Just go without me. I’m reading to him still and he wants to spend time with me.

Me: This is so fucked.

Victoria: See this kind of stuff is when I think you’re being insensitive.

Me: You don’t think it annoys the fuck out of me that you do this shit to me all the time?

Victoria: I have a 5 year old son and don’t get to see him much, fuck off. We can hang out later if it’s not too late. The only reason you invited me is because you don’t want to third wheel. That’s selfish.
(I don’t know where she got this from, being that we’ve been friends for 1/3 of our lives and going to the beach at night is something we always used to do together).

I went without her and I stopped talking to her after that night. Haven’t talked since.

We have been friends for almost 8 years, and I have matured since I was 17 to the point where I have no place for people who don’t respect my time.

c1f0l0	2019-06-16 21:11:26	ghostbacon2020	AITA for handling a package that got misdelivered to my ex’s house?	"So me and my ex were together for a long time. It’s been a long and complicated relationship but we’re still in each others lives because we’re still good friends. We've had ups and downs and we're doing ok these days, I go over to his house a lot, I stay over nights, We cook together sometimes, I make him coffee in the morning from his own French press and he doesn't complain. I grab him tissues from my car when he runs out of TP and he doesn't act like I'm ""getting too involved."" I fall into little domestic habits around him and he does the same, I just do stuff that's pragmatic and I'm only ever trying to help.  Make of that what you will. 

He has a long history of avoiding normal everyday tasks and not dealing with things in a timely fashion until there is either no point dealing with them anymore (his favourite) or they are much bigger problems,  eg: i was helping him move house one day a couple of years ago and noticed there was mail sticking out of his mailbox and found months old snail-chewed letters and bills. Case and point. 

so when I saw a package at his house sitting on his coffee table for a couple of days that had been misdelivered, I asked him about it and was not satisfied that this was going to ever get sorted. 

I thought to myself why should this person lose their package because of my ex's characteristic lack of responsibility.   So I thought hey I'll make it easy for him and see if I can find the owner on Facebook, sure enough I found a fairly innocent looking mother who turned out to live in the same street name with a different postcode. I messaged her and she replied. All was going well.   It seemed like I had done a good deed for all involved. 

Until I mentioned to him that I'd found whose package it was and made contact. The ex flipped out at the ""audacity"" of going and finding the owner of this package that fate brought accidentally to his house.   

Other factors may include that he was the victim of a home invasion many years ago, and could still be terrified of strangers at his house without me realising? (I have now told owner of package she can pick up from my house instead of his as he got angry I ""invited a stranger to his property"" when I said he could ask him to leave the package in the mailbox for her to pick up) 

Have I really overstepped my boundaries that much as an ex and current friend? 

Enough to warrant being called ""crazy"" and being continually berated about this every time it's brought up? He’s obviously a good guy most of the time given I haven’t completely given up on him as a friend - if a little flaky on domestic responsibilities,  but this seems like an overreaction to me. 

(but ffs i was more concerned for a woman missing her delivery than his indignation towards me taking initiative on something that he should have just dealt with)"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"Ever since my messy divorce 2 years ago, I've gotten myself in a truckload of debt, from my ex-partner hounding me for child support to paying my medical bills. For the last 6 months, I've been practically couch surfing and using food banks to scrape by. I've been unable to work for the past year and still waiting on disability support (calling them everyday at this point to check on the process). I owe about $15000 in my line of credit, $4000 in various credit card bills, and $8000 to various friends who've loaned me money along the way.

Enough is enough, and I'm planning to declare bankruptcy to start a clean slate. (I have considered other options like consumer proposal, but I just want to get this done and over with. The longer this drags on, the worse my mental health becomes.) I talked to the one friend who loaned me $4000 (I should also add that she made me sign a contract for 8% interest rate to take advantage of me) and she's absolutely livid that I'm not intending to pay her back. She then said she was willing to settle on half the amount I borrowed if I can pay back by the end of the month. My best friend (whose place I'm crashing at) forgave the $1000 he lent me and told me to ignore everyone who's harassing me for money as after bankruptcy they legally can't collect on it anymore. I've also been smart to not tell anybody else until I finalize the paperwork with my trustee.

&#x200B;

me and my boyfriend went to an ice cream place to hang out before he went back to germany to visit his family for the summer.

&#x200B;

we both ordered ice cream and sat down and talked and laughed. we weren't doing any PDA no holding hands,hugging,kissing.or even sitting next to each other. we were just sitting across from each other eating ice cream and talking about our life,summer plans, and funny stories. we always laugh when we are around each other we will just look at one another and bust out laughing. well each time we would laugh there was one employee with a ponytail who would stare at us. my boyfriend pointed her out and said ""she keeps staring at us"" i had noticed but figured she was annoyed to see us hanging out on a Sunday while she had to work (we are teenagers and she looked around our age and i know i wouldn't be happy working on a weekend day) i just kept talking to him and realized we had been in there for 2 hours, but it only felt like 30 minutes. we texted our moms and asked if it was okay that we go hang out at the mall. my mom said yes and we were still waiting for his mom to answer. at this point my boyfriend garbed the salt and pepper shakers and shook some salt on top of the pepper shaker not a lot like 2 shakes yeah i know it still wasn't right but it's not like he poured salt on top of it, he then garbed my phone saying he was gonna text his mom again but texted my mom and asked for embarrassing photos of me i garbed my phone and saw his text and we both started laughing as my mom sent my embarrassing emo stage photos and pictures of me when i was 5 wearing princess dresses. the girl who had been staring at us walked over and said ""you need to act muture or i'll kick you out, salt and pepper cost money...."" she kept going on about how we weren't mature and and the salt. we had to sit there for another awkward 20 mins while we waited for his mom to respond

c1euwk	2019-06-16 20:57:41	youngerguysarecool	AITA for not wanting my Fiancee's friend to be part of the bridal party?	"Hi all. 

I recently proposed to my girlfriend Lauren. It will likely be an autumn wedding and wedding plans are taking up most of our time at the moment. 

Lauren's bridal party will be made up of her best friends. Maid of honour is her best friend Charlotte, who she has known since they were toddlers. Another of her bridesmaids is Megan, and she's someone who - although I have only just told Lauren this - I really don't want playing such a big part in our special day. 

Megan has always disapproved of our relationship for one simple reason: I'm younger than Lauren. I am 26 and she's 31 and we've been together for five years and lived together for three of those. 

Megan has very traditional views. A guy and girl being the same age is cool, as is the guy being a little older, but an older woman and a younger man is ''unnatural'' in her book. She has also told Megan that she doesn't think I'm ''manly'' enough and when we first got together kept acting like Lauren was single and trying to set her up with what she called ''real men''. Last but not least she openly disapproves of the fact that Lauren is more successful and earns quite a bit more money than I do. 

I just can't help but feel that if she dislikes me and our relationship so much, she shouldn't play such a big part in the wedding day. Obviously she is a good friend of Lauren's and should be invited of course, but I just don't think she deserves such a big role. 

I did bring this up with Lauren, but made clear that it's nobody's choice but hers and that I will support her no matter what, but she got upset and had a go at me for trying to influence her, which I swear I wasn't. As I said it's our special day and if Megan has to be a big part of that then that's fine as long as we get married.

Some back story: my dads mother we’ll call Dee. She has resented me for the past 10 years as I’m like my mom. Dee expects me to act like a house wife, only cook and clean and do as she did back when she was my age. As a kid I was quite towards her; as I was taught to stay quiet and not talk back. Went mostly no contact with her. 

 Fast forward to 2017 I graduated high school. Dee and my grandpa were 30 minutes late to the ceremony. So first the interrupted the valedictorians speech. Then all the other family members as the tried to find a seat. ( very embarrassing as everyone knew they were related to me). Second the next day I had my grad party. They had to stay in a hotel in the next town as I live in a small town with one hotel which was booked. My party was in the afternoon which I assumed they could be in time for since family normally is there for most of it. They went to my cousins which was 45 minutes away. They came to my party for 30 minutes. Dee didn’t say hi nor even said a word to me the whole time. My grandpa gave me a hug and talked to my friends and other guests. He was explaining how happy he was of me for graduating, normal grandparent things. They left grandpa gave me a hug, a card, and a kiss. 

Now fast forward to 3 weeks ago. 
My cousin had a wedding reception only as she lives in Arizona. We had to drive 2 hours to get there after having to euthanize our family puppy. So obviously we were a little late, by a half hour. She loudly announced that we were late. My cousin hushed her as it’s her day and she went quite instantly. Some time goes by and Dee comes to talk to me. She wants to have a nice normal conversation with me. Asking every question under the sun. She sat down by me a second time to talk to my boyfriend and I. (Completely odd since she never once cared before). She then said I should go to the nascar race with her and the rest of the family sometime. I politely declined for now as I’m sceptical about her nice persona. 

My boyfriend says I should give her a chance. But after being called names and judged for being independent I just don’t know.

Both me and my best friend are very tight. We hang out quite often. (Every other weekend and now the weekdays due to it being summer.) We've had our differences and such but in the end we are very very good friends. Usually after arguments we end up speaking again a day or so later. As well as this we both dont have a habit for holding grudges. 
  Anyways, it all started when me, my best friend, who I will refer to as ""B"" were walking down the sidewalk with my younger sister, who is 7 years old. Me and B are both in our teenage years keep in mind. While we are walking B pulls a juul out of her pocket and starts to hit it. She hits it about 10 times before acting buzzed. As if i didnt feel odd with the fact she was doing this in front of my sister, I felt 10x more uncomfortable when she offered my sister a hit. Before my sister could answer i straight up said ""hell no."" Im terrible at confrontation and let people walk all over me but I just couldnt let my younger sister do this. As of right now my sister keeps asking about the juul and I cant do anything about it.
 As if a 7 year old hitting a juul wasnt bad enough, my sister has fucking heart and lymph node complications, which lead to us having to take her to the doctor almost montly.
  After I said no, B said I was ""no fun"" and to stop being stuck up. She then began insulting me and such. After all of this happened I stop talking to B. I haven't talked to her in a few days even after she's tried to contact me through Discord, Instagram, Snap, and even texting me.

c1etcb	2019-06-16 20:53:48	Terribul_at_English	AITA for not telling my ex that I'm still on her Spotify family plan?	"Short one here,

Me and my ex didn't end on exactly the right foot.

In the past we all had our own Spotify accounts being billed sepeeately for premium service. I would pay the full $10 a month and she paid the $5 student plan. Her little sister had the free plan, with the lower quality and ads.

About a year or two into the relationship I had offered to put us all under a family plan being billed from my bank so her little sister could get premium without the amount of money being billed changing.

A little while after this I had come onto some hard times financially and was unemployed for about 3 1/2 months.

She had offered to switch up the family plan and put me and her sister under her account, and for $15 dollars a month the three of us had the premium plan. 

Blah blah breakup time, didn't go well, and here we are.

I've noticed that I haven't been charged for Spotify in a while about a month or two ago, so I checked my billing section of my account and saw the message saying ""you are part of another users family plan.""

Now here are the semantics:

The family plan gives you 4 slots to add other people's accounts under yours without increasing the price from $15 a month. Me and her sister take up two of those slots. If she were to add anyone else she would definitely see my name on that list and remove me from her family plan. But she hasn't yet, I also don't know if she's added anyone to her plan because why would I need to know that?

If she and her sister both got student accounts then that would kick me off and charge them a grand total of $10 a month, but her sister is high school age and doesn't qualify for the student discount (something something college .edu email address)

So my two roommates and I agreed near the beginning of our lease that we would be sharing the cleaning by rotating between the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. This last time we agreed to clean, I cleaned the bathroom, which is my least favorite but I agreed to the terms and didn’t mind since it was my turn. But my roommate who was supposed to clean the living room never vacuumed so when my parents visited a few weeks later I ended up vacuuming for him and didn’t say anything because to me it’s not really that much trouble. Right before I was about to start finals, the same roommate asked if we could clean the house again and I said sure but they’d have to wait until after all my finals were done, which he agreed. But then two days later he texted me while I was studying for an exam that he cleaned the kitchen, which was my turn, and that we should switch. Which means I’d have to clean the bathroom...again. I feel like he’s basically forcing me to do the bathroom out of turn when I really don’t want to since he already cleaned the kitchen. To be honest I probably would have agreed to switch since the kitchen was pretty messy but I don’t like how he did it and then asked after the fact. I’d like to know if I’d be a petty asshole or if I’m rightfully mad.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The music I wouldn’t mind, but it’s really loud and distracting. I also wouldn’t mind the diffuser but whatever she uses is migraine-inducing. Both me, my boss and a few others have kindly asked her to use headphones and space out her diffusing. She’ll stop for a few days but picks it up again. It’s gotten to the point where I have to shut my door if I want to get anything done, which sucks because we have an open-door policy. 

I know that getting my boss involved again isn’t the asshole move because my boss has done so before. What makes it a potential YTA is that our secretary is already the loner on our team for reasons unrelated to the above problem.  We have made every effort to include her in things like team lunches, inside jokes, etc. but she is just anti-social. We have given up and rarely make an effort to even speak to her if it’s not 100% necessary. We also complain about her in each other’s offices (whispering so she can’t hear us) because the quality of her work is mediocre at best and I often have to pick up her slack or redo her work completely.  I’m afraid that getting my boss involved again will only further ostracize her, thus making me the asshole.

Edit: by office I really mean a super private cubicle so it’s not like she can close a door. We call it an office because she was sharing a cubicle with two other people at our last place, so this new one is a lot more private."	Not the A-hole	0	0	467.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

c1eqh9	2019-06-16 20:46:42	throwaawayforasshole	AITA for changing plans in the last minute?	"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I would like some perspective on something that happened about a week ago.

&#x200B;

First of all, let me start with a little bit of background. I was born in the lates 80s in Russia and was raised in 90s. For those of you from that part of the world, you get it. For everyone else; growing up in 90s in Russia (especially in the small city like mine) meant that if you are not a son of a gangster, or politician (who are essentially the same people), you will be poor. I will never blame my parents for anything because they worked harder than anyone I know/have met and it's not their fault that the country was in a shit hole. When I grew up, I didn't have much. I went to a school that was right next to my home and many privileged kids went to the same school. So, while I was taking a bus, they had drivers; while I was drawing some doodles in my notebook, they played with action figures (Batman, superman etc.). I was never invited to their PlayStation parties and only heard about those during the breaks. Also, I had to work harder than them because teachers would not give me 5s (A in russian system), as that would mean that I might be on the ""Board of Fame"", instead of those kids. All that led me to one problem; I am always hungry. I don't mean hungry for food; I mean hungry for success. I have to be the best in everything. If I am not, I work my ass off till I become the best. And my goals are only the intermediate step. I don't care much about the end goal; I care more about the process. Once I reach my goals, I am looking at the next one. It's never enough for me. Right now I work for an investment banking and also, working to start my company in fin-tech area.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend is a great person. However, she came up from a middle-income family and she is always happy with what she has. When we started dating, I told her that I have this problem with working extra and I had problems with people before because of that. She said that it didn't bother her but eventually, it led to a conflict.

&#x200B;

We planned to hike. We live in Houston, TX and there is a park in Texas, about 5 hours drive away. We booked a hotel and everything was ready. We planned to leave on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend there. On Friday, I get a call from a venture capitalist (one of the largest one in the country) and they want to meet on Monday. That means that I have to prepare for the meeting; I need to polish pretty much everything. I called my girl and told her that I cannot go and explained her the reason why. She got extremely angry and called me all sort of names. We haven't talked at all, so far and it might lead to the breakup. While I understand that I am wrong, am I really the asshole here?

&#x200B;

I would appreciate the feedback and comments and I am sorry about the grammar.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I was asked to provide more info about the pattern. That kind of things happen about 60% of the time. Being in the investment banking means that no one cares if it's 6 pm on Friday. If a client needs something done, you work until it's done. That's one of the main reasons why investment people in Houston make more than anyone else. We pretty much live at work. So because of those odd hours, I might cancel on some sort of house parties that we are invited to, or I show up in the very end.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I appreciate everyone's comments and feedback. As I have mentioned in the original posting, I know that I was wrong and I just wanted to see how big of an asshole I am. Looks like a huge one lol. Pretty much it boils down to me talking to my girl and seeing if she can still handle the whole situation and it's not like it will get better until I become VP (another 2-3 years) or leave IB (probably won't ever happen). It was also a great opportunity to fully understand the mentality of people who come from similar background as my gf."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1en9y	2019-06-16 20:39:00	smokeproblems	AITA- is smoking a necessity?	"Sorry the title sucks I couldn’t think how to word it into a good sentence.

My bf is a smoker coming up 7 years now. We haven’t been able to be flexible with money as he started a new job and we went 5 weeks in between his new pay starting and last pay check. I work from home (social media posts for a restaurant I used to serve at) with our almost 1 year old. I make enough to cover our car insurance and hydro but not much more, the rest of the income is my boyfriend.

I always give my boyfriend my income as he deals with bills. It’s usually a set amount because I made a set amount of posts, but I made a little extra 2 weeks ago (40$) and was planning on going shopping and getting some summer clothes. Not mandatory, but my body is different than it was last year when I was pregnant so it would be nice to buy something more flattering. I never got a chance to go so the money has been sat in my wallet for awhile. He knew this and told me he would drop me off sometime so I could get a break from the baby too.

Today, he tells me he is out of cash and needs to take my 40$ for gas. I gave him about 700$ cash the start of the week so I am completely blown away by how there is nothing left, and ask him what he spend it on. 

His breakdown was:

-200$ hydro bill 

-200$ car insurance

-150$ gas (20-25$ a day) 

-120$ on smokes (16$ pack a day)

I told him he should have about 50$ left and why can’t he spend that? He said he needs it to get smokes. I told him he should’ve made sure he had gas before smokes and that it’s not fair for me to have to give up my spending money when he has already blown through so much on smokes. He said smoking is an addiction, therefore, a necessity and I was being selfish putting spending money over gas. We argued for awhile on and off about this before he just took my 40$ and went to work. 

I feel like I am right, but I would like some perspective if I am being a selfish asshole wanting the 40 for myself and smoking really is that necessary for him or if he is being unreasonable.

Also note: Our baby is very spoiled and taken care of, when I say the 40$ was extra it was extra after bills, food, new clothes, diapers and a new toy all for him."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She has always had me a bit of a ""favorite"" of me and my sister, and because of that, me and my sister has an extreamly bad relationship.

The reason why I want to break contact with her needs me to go back quite far.

The first thing she has done far too many times is when she has met my ex partner's parents, she has decided to talk about stuff I get anxiety over. After the second time it happened, I told her about it and she promised she would stop, but she never did.

A few years ago(I think around 5 years), she started to talk to me about divorcing my father, and asked me for advice on how to do this. This strained my relationship with my father.

3 years ago, she went through with the divorce after she met someone new(to add to this he is 40 years younger than her, 1 year younger than me), and told me 3 weeks before it happend that it was going to happen, and I could not tell my father about it, which strained my relationship with further.

About 9 months ago, I left an abusive relationship, she was kind enough to let me live with her, but her new husband was just plain disrespectful to me and otherwise ignored me. I have now moved out and moved to a different country, and a lot of my anxiety went away after I left.

The last thing that basically has me starting to think about breaking all contact was when she came to visit me and my partner's family, and she once again started talking about the anxiety stuff and I basically had to scream at her to stop her, and she made fun of me(in my native tounge, which my partner's family doesn't understand) when I was playing with a 1½ year old.

I basically have ignored her after that, and she called me one week ago and told me that she would divorce her husband to save our relationship. I explained that I've had enough of how she acts when she meets people that are important to me and her marrying her husband is just a small part of it all.
She blames this on that she didn't know about the anxiety and she will never do it again, but I feel like she has done it far too many times and I don't trust her around people I love anymore.

this leads to me eating the same 4 or so meals on rotation with a few variations every now and then, and a lot of frozen and microwavable meals. whenever my family go out to eat they have to make sure its ""somewhere he can eat"" which is never particularly hard since most places always sell spaghetti or a hamburger. and if they want to go somewhere that doesn't serve food I like then I just don't go, or will go but eat before/after. at home I generally order take out or make something in the microwave

going on vacation is generally difficult as while i like enjoying different cultures i dont enjoy trying different foods and will generally look for the closest pizza place or mcdonalds, just anywhere where I can get ""food like home"" whilst my family like to try the local restaurants, I don't go in them as ordering food with variations and changes can be very difficult when there is a language barrier.

anyway I recently got into an argument with a buddy of mine who wanted to cook a dinner for all of our friend group, he was going to cook us all a steak with mushroom sauce (I believe thats the name) and when I told him I'll have mine Extra Well Done and without the sauce, he refused to do it and so I just didn't eat anything that evening and went to a KFC on the way home. later on that night in our discord an argument that lasted about 2 hours ensued where my buddy and some other friends told me that I'm an asshole for refusing to eat my friends food after he went through the effort to cook for me, and that buying fast food afterwards is ""so insulting that the fact that you can't see that means you are socially unaware"" and also told me that I should stop going out to eat if I'm just going to butcher a chefs hard work.

c1eh2l	2019-06-16 20:23:40	privatethrowawayo	AITA for telling my ex-husband’s girlfriend that she is “nothing” to my children?	"Kids are 7(m) and 5(f). Divorced two years ago. My relationship with the Gf hasn’t always the best because I believe they started their relationship before my husband and I officially decided to call it quits. However, I’ve basically gotten over it. 

Presently, Ex and I are having some disagreements about visitation schedules. I won’t get into too many details about that part - it’s just complicated. But the latest issue is the 4th of July. Ex wants to take kids to his gf’s parents’ beach house which conflicts with my understanding of our agreement about holiday division. 

Anyway, we were discussing this at ex’s home in the kitchen. Kids were upstairs and out of earshot. Gf comes in (they live together) and basically tries to give her thoughts on the whole thing. We went back and forth and I basically said she doesn’t get a vote. She starts talking about how her she doesn’t get why her opinions aren’t valid etc. I said they aren’t really because, at this point, she’s nothing to my children!

(What I mean is that she behaves as if she’s their stepmother but she is not). After I said that, she just walked out. Literally left the house and took off. (I guess she just went for a drive to clear her head but it all felt very dramatic in the moment). 

Ex called me later and said my comment was cruel. But if I’m being honest, I don’t feel guilty at all. 

Looking for some truthful feedback here on whether I’m wrong (if so, I will apologize)."	Asshole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1eh25	2019-06-16 20:23:38	scaredoftheirlove	UPDATE AITA for following my [42M] wife [27F] around for an evening?	"Here is a link to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita\_for\_following\_my\_42m\_wife\_27f\_around\_for\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita_for_following_my_42m_wife_27f_around_for_an/).

If you don't want to read it, here's the summary...I believed my wife to be having an affair with a coworker who had repeatedly appeared in her pictures and conversations. So, one happy hour, I followed her. Even though I had seen nothing definitive, I confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.

Believe it or not, I listened to your advice. I received extensive advice from both sides. Publicly, everyone agreed I was at fault. In my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. Regardless, I sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, Brandon. I told her I did not feel as attractive as Brandon and worried that as I was getting older, her interest in me was waning. I also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. I apologized for following her and told her I would never do it again.

She told me several things. First, that she was offended I did not trust her. Second, that she did suspect Brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. Third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. The thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.

She also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. She reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.

So, what of our future? I asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after I had followed her. She joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. She told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (Java, specifically). I haven't told her yet, but I plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the Maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that I never heard of until researching...

TL;DR - My wife and I are back on track. Thank you, genuinely.

Thank you to the kind user who helped me figure out how to create this update post."	Asshole	0	0	34.0	4.0	0.0	0.0
c1egie	2019-06-16 20:22:15		AITA for casually tracking down the owner of a package sent to my ex's place?	"So me and my ex were together for a long time. We've had ups and downs and we're doing ok these days, I go over to his house a lot, I stay over nights, We cook together sometimes, I make him coffee in the morning from his own French press and he doesn't complain. I grab him tissues from my car when he runs out of TP and he doesn't act like I'm ""getting too involved."" I just do stuff that's pragmatic and I'm only ever trying to help.

He has a long history of not dealing with things in a timely fashion until there is either no point dealing with them anymore (his favourite) or they are much bigger problems, 

so when I saw a package at his house sitting on his coffee table for a couple of days that had been misdelivered, I asked him about it and was not satisfied that this was going to ever get sorted. I thought to myself why should this person lose their package because of my ex's characteristic lack of responsibility. 

So I thought hey I'll make it easy for him and see if I can find the owner on Facebook, sure enough I found a fairly innocent looking mother who turned out to live in the same street name with a different postcode. I messaged her and she replied. All was going well. 

It seemed like I had done a good deed for all involved. Until I mentioned that I'd found whose package it was and made contact. The ex flipped out at the ""audacity"" of going and finding the owner of this package that fate brought accidentally to his house. 

Other factors may include that he was the victim of a home invasionany years ago, and could still be terrified of strangers at his house without me realising? (I have now told owner of package she can pick up from my house instead of his as he got angry I ""invited a stranger to his property"" when I said he could ask him to leave the package in the mailbox for her to pick up) 

Have I really overstepped my boundaries that much as an ex? Enough to warrant being called ""crazy"" and being continually berated about this every time it's brought up?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1ecq1	2019-06-16 20:13:01	Naenerd	AITA for yelling at a man with his dogs off leash?	"So, yesterday I took my dog for a walk in this forested area in my city, and at the entrance of this trail, there are signs that explicitly say to leash and clean up after your dog. 

Most people usually abide by these rules, but there always happens to be someone who thinks they are more self entitled  than everyone else to not heed these signs. I have heard so many stories of people's dogs being hurt by loose dogs off leash, so I tend to be very weary of people who do this, and when I see a dog unleashed coming toward us, I just pick my pup and walk past them until they're gone. Most people actually leash their pups if they see another dog headed their way most days at this location.

&#x200B;

Well, yesterday when I stopped walking to give my dog some water, a very large, what looked like a husky came barreling toward us and stops right at my feet. It scared the fuck out of me first off, and I just picked up my pup as quickly as possible. The other dog seemed to not be aggressive after all, but still charged at us like we were in their territory. 

Minutes later the people who owned this dog as well as a couple other pups that had shown up in that time, and I straight up said they were assholes for letting their dogs run wild and don't even bother stay with them, as there are a bunch of other people out their walking the trails. I was met with this man (probably in his 60s) yelling in my face and giving me shit,  like it was my fault or something that his dogs couldn't behave enough not to charge at someone like that. And especially because they were no where to be found for several minutes afterward.  

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for saying he was lucky I didn't mace his dogs and him? As he didn't like this very much and egged me on to go ahead and do it and see what happens. Seriously, a grown ass old man got up in my face, as I am a woman in my 30's, not that it matters. It was just really rude to not bother to leash them, and not even after his dog charged at me like that.

&#x200B;

So I (21F) grew up with both of my parents. My dad worked full time, and my mom was a stay at home mom who spent most of her time working on her business (which my dad also worked on when he wasn't at work). Because of my dad's job and their business, I didn't spend much time with my dad growing up. To his credit, he did come to all my sports and school events, wanted to see me do my best, and always supported me financially. Despite this, however, he is narcissistic. I won't get into it too much, but he has always made a competition out of everything we do together. He always needs to get his way. If I express any kind of disagreement with anything he does, he gives me the silent treatment for up to 10 days. Both my parents do this. They always have. It doesn't even need to be anything big, either. 

&#x200B;

Along with this, my dad is extremely sexist. He has always controlled how long my hair is, how much makeup I wear, and whether or not I get tattoos and piercings. He's demeaning toward my mom, gets mad at her over the tiniest disagreement, and regularly calls her stupid. He seems to think I'm lazy, in general, for no reason whatsoever. Any time I'm on my computer and he can't see the screen, he'll walk behind me, stare at the screen, and ask why I'm wasting my life playing computer games (even though the only thing I do on my computer is apply for jobs and finish homework). Basically, he's made me feel like I'm worthless, will never amount to anything, and is the reason I'm constantly afraid of accidentally upsetting him over something small. I even went to therapy for this, and was told my depression and anxiety are probably a direct result of my upbringing.

&#x200B;

A couple months ago, I moved back home from college for the summer. After two straight years of living on my own and having freedom, he's back to controlling my life. And it's been a nightmare. Yesterday, my mom invited her family over to celebrate my grandpa on father's day. While everyone was over, literally in front of a couple dozen family members, my dad mentions how ungrateful his kids are and how we have never once even wished him a happy father's day. Everyone seemed to think my brother and I were the worst people in the world. I mean, he *has* paid our way through college, and was always there for our events as kids. I just said we've never celebrated father's day. Which is true. My brother and I have never done anything for either of my parents for mother's or father's day. They don't really like making a big deal out of it, and they don't even like getting anything on their birthdays. This, coupled with the fact that my dad has made my life hell, makes me feel like I shouldn't even acknowledge him on father's day.

c1ebxi	2019-06-16 20:11:10	Q3ZTop	AITA - for laughing at night when my wife is sleeping and thus waking her up?	"We have been married for 9 years. I have never been able to sleep well. I typically get 3-5 hours of sleep a night. 

Before we got married I was happy getting in bed around 11:00pm and hopefully falling asleep by 1-2:00am. 

When we got married my wife made it clear that she wanted us to go to bed at the same time. Okay, I will read in bed... no go, any light on was to bright, no reading allowed. 

It took a month or two of me tossing and turning for 4-6 hours trying to fall asleep before we realized there had to be an alternative, so we settled on the idea that I would listen to podcasts on my phone with headphones. 

Fast forward nine years and 2 kiddos and my wife has said that she finds it very hurtful that I will listen to podcasts or read something on my phone that makes me laugh and wake her up. She said that she thinks I am intentionally doing this, “laughing”, knowing full well it will wake her up. AKA that I am an Asshole. 

I said that I didn’t think that was fair because she only wakes up sometimes when I laugh, as opposed to every time. 

I also said that I think this has been more of a problem lately, that she is sleeping more softly. Over the years I haw often gotten up at night and cleaned the kitchen, done dishes, cleaned the play room, etc. However now that we live in a creaky old rental, every move I make seems to wake her up. 

I asked if she could try wearing ear plugs to sleep at night, knowing I have a difficult time sleeping, and may move around at night. She said she does not think that is fair. 

So, AITA for laughing at night? Is waking someone up laughing a particularly unkind offense as opposed to waking them up with some other noise?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	535.0	36.0	0.0	0.0
c1eb0o	2019-06-16 20:08:49	MarkC-X	AITA For not really liking my Dad?	"Hey guys, help me out here because I’m a bit conflicted.

I’m 23M and I don’t really think I like my dad and I don’t enjoy spending time with him. 

Here are my reasons: he cheated on my mum three times, once while she was carrying me, another time whilst I was 11 and another time when I was about 13/14 - this one I actually found out before my mum as he received a message on his phone whilst I was using it. Obviously the two I knew about made me really really upset because I completely understood what it meant:

When my mum finally had the courage to leave him around 4 years later. He was very aggressive towards her, causing her physical and emotional harm. Also he would bad mouth her to me, despite him never making any effort to show any affection towards her. I understand he was upset.

Additionally, when they were together, although we have had some nice moments, he’d be very very verbally aggressive towards me but sporadically like I’d always have to make sure when he was home I was out of his TV room otherwise I’m getting attacked. I’ve also been thrown into a wall before, smashing into a wall before, of which he never said sorry.

These days however, he is a different, when I see him at least. He’s got a wife now and he doesn’t have a temper with me anymore and is actually nice. He doesn’t check in or anything, and won’t contact me unless I contact him but he isn’t a dick. Even if he is still unreliable.

Despite this, and my mum forgiving him and actually being pretty cool with him now. I find it very hard to be relaxed and cool with him and I don’t really want to see him. This makes me come off as quite rude and aloof, especially to his new wife, which she doesn’t deserve, she is nice.

In my heart of hearts I’d like to be cool with him but I can’t seem to be

"My husband and I live next door to a woman and her partner and three kids, ages 6,4,1 approximately. I do feel for her, we live in an older building and I can’t imagine having three small kids in such a small place all day. That being said, she yells at the constantly. We can hear her quite distinctly through our shared walls. She starts early in the morning and can go all day. We know the kids names because she is so often screaming at them. I know kids need to be disciplined and I don’t have any kids myself so I don’t know what it’s like to be a parent, but her yelling even stresses me and my husband out and we don’t even live with her.
I would simply tell her that we hear her yelling at her children and we think it’s too much for children so young and that she should try to talk to them more instead of yelling. I don’t want to be rude, but I am hoping if she thinks about her behaviour through the eyes of another adult she’ll realize she’s being too hard on them. I’ve met the children myself many times, they are sweet and kind and even help with taking out the garbage.
I want it to be anonymous because of an incident that happened last month. I was coming home from work and I found her one year old at the top of the stairs by himself in only a diaper. I carried him away from the stairs and waited for someone to come out but no one did. Finally I knocked on her door since I knew he was hers and she came out and without speaking to me took her child and started yelling at the older children for letting the baby out and shut the door in my face. She does not like me.

We shared very embarrassing, open stories, daily updates of our love life, went on holiday, and generally got on.  

I recently got out of a toxic relationship and into a beautiful, healthy one, moved into my first home and started making better life choices. I was always aware she had a nasty streak but figured as long as i was on the right side of her then who cares, just put it down to her being a drama queen. 

However since i have pulled back from the friendship, mostly because i was sick of pacifying her toxicity, she has become incredibly hard to work with; overly critical, on my back about everything imaginable, being very intimidating and cold. 

It all came to a head when she collard me when i was on my own and let rip; taunting me with very petty observations, asking me provoking questions that belittled my ability in order to cause me to be the one to start the obvious brewing confrontation, so i asked her, look your obviously trying to get a reaction so whats the issue.. and she basically attacked my entire performance at work, saying that everybody had an issue with it, that i wasnt pulling my weight, that i wasnt repaying the other women at work by reciprocating favours, and this was all done very viciously and cold. Her imtent was to confront and intimidate, none of it was constructive or helpful. 

I continued to bring up the fact that her work space was left in a sorry state, something i had noted down, and she told me she did it deliberately ‘so i knew how it felt’  this really hit hard as i felt it was manipulative and degrading. And a massive exaggeration on any of my shortcomings. 

She has always had a nasty bitchy streak and always has something awful to say about other co workers, especially the new girl, generally just giving her a hard time. 

Among other scandals (sending inappropriate pics) to other male members of staff, i feel it would be justified to file a formal complaint. 

My issue is that she is very intelligent, technically good at the job (shit people skills) and did have some valid points..

That said, he is better now and will likely be going back to work on the first. In general, he is the kind of guy who would stay up all night and sleep all day (and sleep 14+ hours) if left to his own devices. Meanwhile I can't sleep in past 10am really ever, even if I were to go to sleep at dawn. Also I get up really easily from alarms, meaning sitting up, alarm off, and light on by the second ring while this guy will sleep in past alarm after alarm. 

Before sick leave it was reasonable. He would at least get up for work. Now even though hes set his alarm for the same time he will be getting up for work he doesn't get up. I guess he doesn't see the point and to be fair he IS still on sick leave. But seriously he cant get up until after 1pm. I go in to his room and try to get him up usually 2 or 3 times every morning I'm not at work. It only works if I bring him food or turn on his light, turn off his fan, and turn off his AC. I feel like his mother, its humiliating. This morning I tried nice once and then it was ""Hey fuckhead, get up.""

I don't think this is the type of post where I'm obviously not the asshole because in his defense:

* He technically doesn't have to be anywhere until 7/1

* I'm mean

* I can be clingy and I want to hang out a lot

* up until maybe a week ago he was in almost daily chronic pain for 8+ hours a day

And on my side:

* I'm extremely resentful about the fact that I've been the only one paying for anything for ~7 months and I try really hard to bottle it up because if I mention that he gets really hurt, but fuck when I get home from work and he's sleeping or playing video games and he doesn't have time for me or cleaning I just get MAD

* Its very hard to empathize with someone for something when you have just no point of experience to even begin to help you understand what they're going through. I'm trying.

* He isn't in pain any more

* He will have to wake up at this time for work in a few weeks any ways

**EDIT: By better, I mean basically cured by the way. I should have been more specific. He has woken up in pain once over the last 10 days or so and it went away within an hour of doing his treatment. I apologize for not making this more clear.**

**EDIT 2: ""I'm sorry I called you a fuckhead this morning sweetie."" ""Oh, I didn't hear that part lol.""**

**EDIT 3: I showed him this. I am completely the asshole. He has been playing down how much pain he is still in. Apparently despite how much better it is after an hour into the day he still wakes up in a lot of pain and just didn't really tell me or maybe I just didn't understand or forgot (bad memory). I am the asshole.**

For some important preliminary information: This is a new Reddit account, but I’ve been around. I am deaf. However, a fair amount of my friends are Hearing. That friend group is the one in question today.

I have had some issues off and on with this friend group. Often we got along well, but I always get the sense that I’m seen as something of a “liability,” like I restrict them or cause problems. 

Yesterday my friends were trying to plan something in a group chat. A particular friend, who I’ll call “Sam,” made a comment:

> Well, I don’t think we should do the movie, because then we’d have to worry about [me] not having a good time

This was not the first time Sam has said something like this. In fact, it’s kind of frequent that they shoot down ideas *for me*, presuming that I will not enjoy or want to do something. 

It made me angry, and I basically told Sam that she doesn’t need to speak for me, and that I am more than capable of having a good time at the movies anyway. I haven’t talked to her since, but another person in the chat messaged me and told me that I was too harsh to Sam, and that I should relax. 

I’m not sure how to feel about this, and so I guess that brings me here. Apologies of this seems too simple to silly; I try very hard to be kind and polite and so I do really worry when a friend says that I overreacted and went too far.

c1e4vw	2019-06-16 19:54:11		AITA for getting mad over my charger being stolen?	"Context: I'm 15F and have social anxiety, and therefore I get easily anxious when my phone is under 40 percent charged. Therefore I always carried my charger with me in school.

So this one day I lend my phone charger (for iPhone 8 if that matters) to a friend, and I forget it because I'm almost late for my bus home. First when I'm home around one hour later, I realise I forgot it. So I begin texting my friend who lend it, if she had it. She texts me ""I left it at school, since I thought it'd be easier for you to find it"". No problem, my phone had around 77% so it was fine. The next morning I'm the first to arrive at school, and I knew my teacher was the last.
So I look at the spot, and it's gone. I begin to panic a little, and then I ask my teacher if she has seen it, she saw it before she left, and she too left it there.
I used my recesses to ask around/look for it, didn't find it.
So I begin actually panicking. My phone by this time is down at 30%
When I come home and tell my parents, they get quite mad and blame me for losing it. They tell me to buy a new one with my own money (mind you, I get barely $15 a month and had no luck with any jobs, so obviously I'm a little picky what I use my money on) I get a little mad, but decide to buy one of those fake cheap $7 charger, it worked for a while until it broke. 
Then this conversation happened 
Me: mom can I borrow your charger, mine broke
Mom: no, I need it 
Me: also your Ipads charger? Workphone charger? Can't I borrow one of them? 
Mom: no, it's not my fault yours broke
Me (getting a little angry): it's not my fault mine was stolen
Dad (joining the convo): you should've been more responsible.
Me: but I shouldn't have to pay for a charger that cost me roughly two months of house work, because mine was stolen!

And from there it just spiralled into an argument.

c1e4si	2019-06-16 19:53:57	silently_seething	WIBTA if I told a family member's wife that her husband cheated on her?	"I went on a trip with extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, kids, etc.).  There was a rumor that one guys from the family hooked up with a woman while there.  Problem though, he is married and has a baby and neither his wife nor the baby attended the trip.  When confronted with this, he initially denied it.  However, when pushed, he admitted he was inappropriate with the woman but did NOT have sex with her.  His recollection of the events differed from the woman's as she said that they did indeed had sex.  The whole family who attended knows what happened and the subsequent admission, but many just don't want to talk about it and have decided to move on/pretend like it didn't happen.  The guy even asked that we didn't inform his wife (which made me think that they do not have an open marriage, plus he'd be the type of guy to tout that sort of thing).  I'm appalled by his behavior and feel awfully for his wife, especially since they have been married for a while, just had a baby, and the wife is very sweet.  I would hate to ruin their relationship and their family but I do not think it is right that so many family members know but have chosen not to say/do anything.  It makes me feel as though we are complicit in the whole thing and the coverup.  I am worried because the guy has a history of cheating on girlfriends and it makes me think that this may not be the first time that he has cheated on his wife, just the first time he has gotten caught (although I do not have evidence of this, it's just a hunch).    


Additionally, I am concerned about the fallout with the rest of the family.  The guy and his immediate family would be the type to blame everyone and anyone else if things went south for the the guy and his wife (or even just finding out that someone told her) and would most likely make it difficult for the rest of us (the guy's wife married into the family so even if they got divorced we'd be left with him not her).  A few family members have had issues with the guy in the past and may be blamed even if I told her anonymously, so it leaves me in a bit of a dilemma. 

&#x200B;

I don't want to cause more drama than what has already occurred, but I don't feel right not saying anything.  Would I be the asshole if I told the guy's wife he cheated on her?  Or should I just not get involved?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1e4rg	2019-06-16 19:53:52		AITA for getting upset on Father’s Day?	"I am a husband and father of 2 kids. 8 yr old boy and 6 yr old girl. My wife and I will get divorced in the near future. However, I still dote on her as if we weren’t. Because I still love her for being the mother of my children. 

I take care of my family and it’s my number 1 priority. I hang out with them a lot. I shower them with gifts and love. I teach my boy life lessons and how to act accordingly. I am very involved. I treat my wife like a queen tho i don’t she deserves it. I do it because I know it’s ending and I want to show her we ended it on a good note (kids are aware of pending divorce) I do too much for my wife while trying to teach her to be independent. 

Normally I don’t get anything on holidays but now I want to feel appreciated since soon we won’t be a family that’s together all the time. My wife mentioned she wanted to do something for Father’s Day and I got excited. This morning she and the kids woke up late and she only woke up because of me or she would still be sleeping at noon. Come to find out she didn’t want to do anything and didn’t have anything prepared. Not a card, not breakfast, nothing. I don’t need to be pampered but I thought at least I would have something even if it small and simple. I asked if she and kids wanted to take a stroll into town. Reluctantly they got up. My blood started to boil. I calmed myself down. As my wife tried to get my son to get dressed for going out on Fathers Day, he said something along the lines of “I know it’s Father’s Day but I don’t want to do anything.” He’s just a kid and I don’t hold it against him but I felt hurt and felt like all the talks about being respectful and appreciative hadn’t made an impact. I felt defeated. Then they got dressed and waited for me in the car. I didn’t even know they got in the car. They were just going to wait for me until I figured it out. Unfortunately, it set me off. I went to the car and scolded them. I said how that holidays always remind me of how much love and work I put into my family and I don’t ever get anything in return. My wife just sat there and listened. I told my son how I felt about his comment. I took off my in my truck like a child by peeling out of the drive way. 

I don’t need a parade but for all the hard work and love I give them, some times something materialistic or tangible as a gesture of appreciation would be nice. But I don’t have it.

My husband and two friends were out for a nice dinner in a down town area of a major city. So lots of bars, restaurants, and shopping down one major street. The place we chose for dinner was upscale. It was about an average of $25 a plate and it was nice weather outside so we decided to eat on the patio.

The place was really busy and even though we got seated at around 7:30pm our food didn't arrive until after 8:30pm. It was a really nice outdoor patio area with fire pits, a live band, a large bar, and a lot of people. There were families, couples, and old folks jamming to the music.

A group of kids started playing near us on the fire pits when we arrived and continued through out the evening. There was four kids and they looked about 5 to 7 in age. They had toy cards and were throwing them back and forth to each other. Sometimes rolling them, sometimes pitching them. They were plastic and larger than hot wheel sized. The parents supervised when we first arrived but went to their table well in the back of the patio about the time our food arrived. I didn't mind the kids playing as long as they didn't bother us, but we did all remark it was weird for kids to be at a bar area, past 9pm, playing near a fire pit.

Once our food arrived they started getting more rambunctious and hit our legs and backs with the cars when they threw them. My husband turned around once to one of them after they hit us and told the little girl to stop throwing them. Two more hits to our legs later and I said ""That's it - next time they hit us - I'm keeping that car."" Sure enough, they chucked it and it rattle around underneath our table hitting a few of us. I picked up the toy car and put it on our table and went back to eating. The little girl ran up and tried to swipe it off the middle of the table and I just said ""No, you can't have it because you don't know how to not hit people.""

My friend at this point jumped up because he said the parents we're coming up from the back of the restaurant and looked pissed off that we took the kids toys. My friend gave it back to him and said ""I think this is yours."" The parents came over and made a big production of how it looks like the kids have to leave now since they can't play. One of the kids even elbowed me in the arm as his dad dragged him away. Neither of the parents apologized for interrupting our dinner or the way their kids behaved.

I am not a parent, but I was raised to be respectful of others. But, since I don' have kids - WITA? Should I have just given the car back and tolerated it?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	16.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

I live in the same house as my parents as I am still a teenager in high school. My parents and I have a moderately good relationship, and I have one younger sister who is 11.

I woke up this morning at about 8:30AM and both of my parents didn’t come out until about 10:30AM. My father made a great breakfast although he did cut himself with a knife while making it. 

A little later my mother reminded me I had forgotten  to wish my dad happy Father’s Day. I had forgotten and it wasn’t intentionally for me to not have. It was an accident. I told her I would but I was waiting until a little while later so it wouldn’t sound like someone had to remind me. 

I waited until a good time but my father had gone into the bedroom and my mother followed.  I didn’t see them leave however because I was on my computer as everyone else in the room was. Soon my mother came out of the room upset teary eyed and whisper yelling at me that I upset him due to me not ever wishing him a happy Father’s Day. She told me my father was planning to call off anything we would do that day because I had upset his feelings so much by not saying happy Father’s Day and not giving him enough recognition. Our plans were to just stay inside and play games and watch a movie. Nothing much, but apparently I caused him to not want to do that anymore. I was honestly trying to just find a good time to figure out when to say happy Father’s Day and not just out of the blue.

Everyone’s mad at me and it’s shown in how they talk to me. For example as I’m wrong this in my bedroom my sister knocked and said “Dad says ‘get your fucking laundry right now’ those are his words not mine” (except she didn’t say the “fucking” part.

c1e0kn	2019-06-16 19:43:33		AITA for refusing to see my family on Father's Day after they kicked me out, even though they took it back?	"My family is in an awful financial situation, entirely due to the business decisions of my father. He gambled away my (and my brothers') college fund on a housing project that he lost money on, so we're all in debt because of it. This situation is more intense for me than any of my brothers because I had no idea I had six figures in debt until April, and studied humanities unwittingly. I was the only one of my siblings who went to a public school. I listened to my parents when they insisted on me staying in on-campus housing with required meal plans (which added at least $30,000 more in debt under MY name). I trusted my dad when he told me not to worry about it these past four years. I did several internships and focused on my grades so I could graduate successfully, not knowing I would have this much debt. (Before you think the loans were illegal, I'm not sure, I may have signed on when I was a high-schooler. Point is, my dad never told me that ALL of my term bills were paid by loans that were never paid, he never told me to apply my scholarship money to the loans to save thousands of interest instead of putting everything in savings, and on top of this, I lent him my scholarship money ($20k) at one point.) My parents promised they'll help us pay, but there are three of us, and my father is in a massive amount of debt. He insists that the value of his assets > the amount of debt, and that he and my mother are comfortable ""never retiring"", but it's a very messed up situation. They deny that the debt situation is that extreme and have told me several times that I shouldn't worry. I've been training to join the military and my father makes fun of me for it, saying I'm too fat, so it's just a very toxic environment.

I love my family, but living with them has been unpleasant. They gave my car (which I shared with my brothers) to one of them, unofficially, just because he had an internship for the summer, instead of having us share it. One day I got into a fight with my brother because he wouldn't let me use it to see my friend, who lives two hours away, because he wanted to go to the gym. I told my dad, who I expected to correct my brother, but instead my father he offered to buy me a rental car. I got upset because my father buys expensive things despite being in a massive amount of debt. We said nasty things to each other and he told me he wanted me out of the house. I spent 20 hours packing up, packing all of my personal items, throwing out old papers, and officially moved out the next day.

I've been staying with my friend while I apply for jobs these past two weeks. My parents have tried contacting me every few days. I called them a few days ago and they, on the verge of tears, told me they loved me and begged me to come back. I told them I wouldn't come home unless I'm still unemployed by July 1, since I'll have housing with several friends until then.

\*I'll write this in the perspective of my Dad\*

So my Daughter got given her mums car a year ago to use through uni (We're divorced) and she used that through her last year of uni until getting her nursing degree and being very quickly employed at the hospital close by. She decided to upgrade from the 2006 polo to a new 2018 Audi which she has leased. They offered her £600 for the Polo if she traded it in off of her lease so I offered her £600 as-well because I need a car at the moment but added I'd give her an extra £100 if it passes the MOT in 6 months. (As a something extra incase the car proves its value sorta thing)

So 6 months later it passes its MOT, But.. it has a serious advisory saying the dust covers behind the wheels are severally dissolved and it would cost £100 to get them repaired.

So I thought it was fair to say quits to the £100 as it essentially hasn't passed its MOT and I need to get it repaired to avoid major damage. But my daughter insists that it did technically pass its MOT as therefore i owe her £100 while still having to pay for the essential repairs."	Asshole	0	0	18.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

He's entitled in all senses and tends to steal from me. Takes my card and uses my money or steals my cash. He also eats whatever he can find at home at night and treats my mother poorly.

He's a leech, and I refuse to feed him in any sense. Being part of his manipulative shit or giving him literal nourish.

c1dtjf	2019-06-16 19:26:44	sabby55	AITA for being pissed that my husband didn’t take me to a party?	"A few weeks ago my (33F) husband (37M) let me know that it was one of his coworkers 60th birthdays coming up, and that he wanted to go out for the night to celebrate.  He and a few of his coworkers (he works in a mainly male department) get together every so often and have some beers and I assume he meant that this was what was happening for the birthday celebrations. 


About 5 days before the date I was asking husband what time he needed to leave by etc, and suddenly it comes out that this is a big shindig- the coworkers wife has booked a Venue and almost 100 people are going.  I was a little confused and hurt that it seemed he’d kept this from me and hadn’t even entertained the idea of bringing me along (this would have been our first chance to get out together as a couple since our second baby arrived 7 weeks ago, and I do know this coworker and have met his wife)
He explains that the wife needed to keep numbers down and so a few of the other guys were not bringing spouses either, the only one of his “group” that was, is legitimately quite close with the birthday boy and wife.  

That all makes sense to me so I shrug it off.  THEN the day before the party, husband says “I want to tell you this so that you don’t see pictures on the internet... but one of my buddies  Jim is now bringing his wife Bonnie.  They live way out in the middle of nowhere and it’s the only way Jim will be able to get a ride home at the end of the night”.   I think “okaaaaaay” sure, I guess that sounds like it makes sense but of course starting to feel more insulted that the numbers could be flexible for her and not me?  And here’s the kicker, Bonnie just so happens to be my husband’s ex.  It’s been a bit awkward navigating social events now that our husbands work together and hang out socially but I think we’ve been mature about it and despite being pretty self conscious (7 weeks post partum and feeling nothing like my former self yet), I feel like again this makes some sense and at least the two of them won’t be drinking together as she is there to be the designated driver.

Fast forward to this morning, I had just brought my husband his Father’s Day breakfast in bed with our toddler, and was asking him how last night went.  He mentions he got a ride home and I ask who gave him the ride.  He says “Oh Jim’s sister was able to pick up a bunch of us and give us rides home”.  I ask if that means Bonnie didn’t end up going, and he says “oh no, she ended up having some drinks so couldn’t drive”.

Now, we were in front of our toddler so I kept my cool, but I am LIVID.  I feel like I was lied to about this party from the beginning, as a way to keep me from coming along.  It’s quite clear that other spouses were fine to be there and that my husband just didn’t seem to want me there.

* I personally didn't like receiving that text from you because it seems that your underlying assumption is that we aren't smart or capable enough to know its fathers day and we wouldn't reach out to our dad otherwise.
* I know you don't mean to explicitly state that but when you send a message like that, it comes off to me as demeaning, talking down to me, as if I were a child.
* Everyone is with dad right now celebrating fathers day except for me because I'm sick.  I woke up at 7am to tell him that.  
* I know you don't mean ill
* But please try to think more before you send group texts about that sort of thing in the future.
* Think more about the assumptions you're implying when sending the messages you send\* 
* Your intentions are good, but again, if your delivery is bad, you can work on that.  Giving you the feedback the delivery came off differently than what you intended.  

""Wow.  Sorry you are sick; hope you feel better soon.""

* I probably should've waited until tomorrow to give you that feedback.  I'll work on my end on delaying a bit further to ensure I'm being even.  I think what I said is true and ultimately it's a bummer that your response is ""wow"" -- it makes me feel like you're not taking me seriously which is pretty rough when trying to communicate towards a better relationship.  

""u/dadsdaythrowaway11, my love, you really do need to stop.  This is hurtful"".

Sent this before but arrived after:

* Your text really frustrated me.  I know you didn't mean to.  I'm genuinely trying to provide even feedback, acknowledge you're not at fault, and improve our communication style.  

Pause

* I'm sorry you're hurt by my feedback.  I hope you understand why I'm reaching out:  to prevent the hurt that we don't intend to happen through improving our communication.  
* I might not have been the only one who reacted to your text this way too.  But I do want to speak up for myself and set boundaries and improve for the future.
* Sorry that feels hurtful.  Have a good rest of your day 

Let me know, am I the asshole?

I'm sure I could've done things differently here but also trying to setup correct boundaries and stick up for myself while improving our relationship.  Mission failed today :/"	Asshole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

Bob is 24 and lives with his mom. TLDR, they all live under Bobs mother’s roof.  Steve is jobless and so is Bob. They’re my childhood friends but not doing to well financially, or for themselves. 

Bob’s mom works hard to support her daughters and her son (her daughters which are in school & of a natural age to be living at home).

I told Steve about the Witcher 3, and how great it is. I’d really like to get him to play it, and maybe hang out, have some beers and relax after I get home from work. I left my PS4 games at my parent’s condo in another state. I went to visit for Father’s Day. 

Well here I am with the PS4 games in my bag, ready to head home, and I’m having second thoughts.  Should I really be feeding the beast of their unproductive lifestyle? Would I be an asinine friend if I demand Steve gets a job first, before I rent out my games to them?

Tldr: I want to share the fun I had with my friends with some games, but they’re not doing anything with their lives and it makes me feel like a bad friend if I support that lifestyle.

When i got back from
our trip today(gone for almost a week) my bed comforter was completely off the bed and my sweat pants/ tshirt was missing..... i looked around everywhere and as soon as i left my room to check the other rooms i saw my missing pants/shirt on the floor in the washing machine room. Like what the heck? Why would my parents friend/ that dog sit for us think she could just throw my stuff around and why does she think she could go in my room like that? Im pretty sure my parents did not tell her to do this when i asked them and told them they said ""oh she didn't go in your room"" when i have proof it was not how i left it. Am I TA for being pissed the dog sitter did this? She also arranged all the cds i had of music in my room and dvds which i thought was also strange(i had them all stacked up already).

c1dru9	2019-06-16 19:22:43	nyoung745	AITA for only wanting water at a dinner party?	"So I had been traveling around Europe for a few weeks with my bf at the time seeing first my friends in England and then his family in France and Belgium. By the end of our time in Belgium I was feeling pretty tired of being away from home and ready to finish the trip.

Well one of the last nights we were at my bfs uncles house in Belgium he made this really beautiful dinner of rabbit stew and invited some of his friends over and planned a lovely evening in honor of us being there. I wasn't really hungry because we had been eating constantly on this trip but of course i was going to eat the stew, no problem. The problem came when the uncle asked what i wanted to drink and i said, ""Just water please."" He started to tell me he had juice, beer, soda, etc, etc, and i thought he was just making sure i wasn't being too polite and not having something i wanted so i said, ""No thank you, water is great"" because i only wanted water. But he listed off the drinks again, more forcibly this time and just stared at me. And then the vibe changed, with everyone waiting for this to be sorted out so they could start eating. 

I started to feel really weird now because i couldn't understand why this guy wouldn't just let me have water. I said no to the drink options again, more firm this time because i just wanted to move on. He again started insisting, now focusing on me having a beer, why i wouldn't want a beer, it's free beer. Since i wasn't that hungry i REALLY didn't want a beer. But now i started getting angry because i felt like my freedom to drink what i liked was being taken from me, that i had no choice in the matter. It must have showed because i could see how my bf was looking at me. Why was this guy insisting so hard that I need a special drink?! 

Eventually i felt i needed to break the tension so i joked sarcastically, ""well if you REALLY want to give me a beer..."" and he immediately put the beer in front of me, sat down and we finally started eating. I had two sips of the beer and left the rest, being too full to drink it, and the uncle gave me a face as he picked up the nearly full beer after dinner was finished. Later that night my bf brought it up and asked why i had been so difficult and didn't just say yes to a drink. I was shocked because I thought the uncle had been the one in the wrong. My argument was he asked the drink question and i gave him my honest answer of what i wanted, not knowing that apparently water wasn't an appropriate answer. But I did know that I was feeling tired of being in other people's homes, thus a tad combatative. 

Was I the asshole here? As a guest are you supposed to be as little of a problem as possible, or should the host be catering to you and accommodating to you? I can see both sides in this situation. 

Additional info: The uncle was over 50 and grew up in Colombia so I understand it could be a cultural thing. Also there was a slight language barrier as he mostly only spoke Spanish and French."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Parched from browsing reddit, I sat up and grabbed a water bottle from beside the bed. I opened it and began taking a drink, when a sudden feeling of disgust came over me. Slime. Water isn’t slimy, I thought to myself. Instantly, and thankfully before swallowing, I opened my mouth and let all of what I had thought was water, fall onto the bed sheet/floor. Almost vomiting, I stared with tears from shock welling in my eyes, at my fiancé. “Why would you do that?” 

You see, we always keep a water bottle or two next to the bed. He needed somewhere to spit, apparently, and thought a water bottle the perfect solution and placed that too, next to the bed, happening to be right next to another water bottle. 

His response was that, although sorry, I should have inspected the bottle before drinking it, and although I can agree to an extent, I don’t think he should have spit (which is mostly clear) in a water bottle and set it by the bed, where it could easily be mistaken AS WATER.

Sometimes it’s a roving group of them that come at 4am, other times it’s some dude on a bike at 2pm. It’s getting pretty annoying to be woken up at 4am on a Tuesday cause some dudes left his truck running outside my window while he makes a shit ton of noise searching through our trash. There have been certain periods where anywhere from 2-5 different groups have scavenged the area in a single day. Aside for that, some have been ripping open standard trash bags and dumping the contents in the trash cans. Like, we use trash bags in part to control the odor, but now our trash area just smells like rotting food all the time. I’m trying to be understanding and patient, but it’s getting harder for me.

The “responsibility” fell onto my lap when my brother Donald came out as gay, it’s not that he can’t do it but him and his partner are /r/childfree types. They spend every dime they can traveling and made it clear to my family there are no kids coming. 

So it’s always been understood that I would carry on this. My wife never mentioned any issues when my father often brought up. Even made a compromise that we would name our daughter after her grandmother if we have one. 

When we got married in 2015, we knew it would be a few years before we had kids. I was traveling a lot for work and she was still getting her JD.  all the work and stress led to a pretty awful sex life. We maybe had sex once a month between 2016-2017. We were both tried of it so I quit my job in the oil industry and went to work full time back home. This came at a significant cost financially at first but my grandfather Donnie passed and left me with several rental duplexes that I now am the landlord of. 

So around last year I mentioned that we should finally start to have kids. She was Uber excited. Dumped the birth control and we started to go to town. For a few weeks it was the best sex we ever had.  Then almost over night it stopped. Back to the every few weeks. 

A few nights ago I lost it, I asked her if she was cheating on me because we basically live in a dead bedroom. She told me she started to take birth control again and it has completely killed she sex drive. 

That didn’t really answer my question so I admittedly got more angry.  She said she wasn’t cheating but that she couldn’t bring a son named Donald into this world. She refuses to even consider it. She broke down and admitted that she even took plan b a few times to avoid it. 

I have started talk to a lawyer on Friday. He told me to take the weekend to think about it. I could lose my house, my dog and more importantly my nest-egg I’d rental property if the divorce. I can’t even look at her."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I (20F) have a part time job and due to being one of the most flexible staff members as well as not being able to say no I work 3/4 Saturdays 9:30-5. On top of that for the past week I had work Mon-Wen on top of working ever spare minute on a project I barely finished for my Thursday night class, ended up at a recital for my niece on Friday then the hardest shift of the year (summer reading kick off that had more than double the expected turn out) on Saturday. This up coming week I work Mon-Wen with ANOTHER project (which I’m also meeting separately with group on Monday after work) due Thursday and likely being forced to go shopping on Friday. This is what most of my summer will be like.


Here’s the story part: 
I really want just a chill day with friends next Saturday to finally go on “ramen date” which we’ve been planning since December. Friends being the my best friend of 10 years and my ex boyfriend I still get along with. Problem is my mom didn’t bother to tell me until today she RSVPed for me to go to a bridal shower that day. 


Firstly, I HATE bridal showers and only go to them if they are family since I feel that as a family member I should. Second, my mom knows I have bad anxiety with group things and will still give me a lecture if I try to do any of my personal coping mechanisms (browse reddit, fiddle with trinkets, find someplace quiet for a bit) to deal with that. And lastly and most importantly, I BARELY KNOW THE CHICK. Pretty much she *used* to go to our church and I apparently went to her grad party. I can’t even remember her name beyond it starts with M. I don’t even know if I’m invited to the wedding to be honest... this was the first I heard of her since she graduated 3 years ago. 


When I asked my mom if I could get ramen with my friends instead she practically broke down about how it’s a girl thing and the rest of the girls (my 2 older sisters) are going and that it’s supposed to be a family thing (again, no relation to this chick). I dared say I want a relaxing weekend and that I haven’t seen my BFF since last summer and I should really see her since her pets died recently and I want to be there for her. My mom decided we aren’t talking about this now (fair since she’s working on cleaning the kitchen for Father’s Day picnic plan B) but I know she will say the same thing every time I bring it up until day of meaning no chance to plan with friends and even if I don’t go to the bridal shower I’d end up being home instead because friends will think ramen isn’t happening and fill the Saturday.


Her reaction is making me feel like maybe I’m being immature and I should go to the bridal shower but I know I’ll be completely miserable there like I always am at “family” things. And we will probably stay from the very very beginning until clean up is over+ (I can’t drove so I can’t just leave)

Warning: I'm not that great at writing, so I hope this makes sense. Tl;dr at the bottom.

So I have this friend, which I'll call N. We met in 7th grade through a mutual friend, and we often joked around a lot to each other. In 8th grade, she asked to vent to me. I let her, and she talks about her family and depression. I comfort her, but N started to act strange around me. I would give her my lunch because she wouldn't eat at home. She would often limp around me (a signal of being weak from not eating?), which I'm not sure was fake or not. Sometimes she would break out crying randomly, and our friend group would try to comfort her. We would tell adults that N was fine since she didn't want adults to help or question/interfere with her life at home. The strange thing is that N started to follow me around campus like she had nothing else to do. I gave a few signs that I was uncomfortable or wanted to be alone, but she would never catch any of them.
Now, I had my own problems at the time. I decided to vent back to her about something I had done that I still feel bad about today. The next day, she started poking fun at me for it, and my friends started to pressure me into ""spilling the tea"". I told them about another event to divert the conversation. I wanted to question N about why she did this, but I kept my temper and continued the day normally. She would do this to almost everything I told her.
Another thing that pulled my strings was that N would pretend to be smarter than she actually was. One example was during our 8th grade orientation. Families rotated around and checked out the teachers and classrooms. N and I were both in the math classroom we would be taking  that year. We both looked through the textbook and talked about how that math class would be really quite easy to tackle. However, throughout the year, she would constantly ask for help. I did, until I got tired and told her to ask someone else. Another example would be when we were arguing about astronomy. I told her that light-years were a unit of distance, not time. She took out her Chromebook and tried to hide the fact that she was searching it up, as if I would mock her for not knowing (something she would often do to me). She would criticize my writing and work (which got pretty good scores) and then get worse scores on hers. 
The only thing keeping me from breaking our friendship is the fact that N has pretty severe depression. I don't want to hurt her in any way, since she would take it pretty badly.

Tl;dr my friend N decides to spill her problems on me, then mock mine. However, if I do break our friendship, I would feel guilty because she has depression. WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	5.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

The birds wait every morning for her to throw out the bread and they are very loud. Also note that she does this in the early hours of the morning, maybe around 5am. Yesterday i knocked on her door and asked if she could stop feeding the birds or at least feed them when my car isn't parked because of the reasons i mentioned above. also note she is around 60 years old. She then says that because she throws the bread on her grass, she doesnt have to listen to me and shuts the door. Today i decided to wake up early and scare away the birds while they were eating. I then picked up the bread and threw it in the bin.

My mom would not promise to keep that quiet. M asked her to say she figured it out from the insurance company but she would not promise. 

My mother and I work during the week and aren't home which leaves M alone at home and very vulnerable. M admittedly got very upset by this and was then yelled at by our mother for ""bitching her out"". 

I sided with M and was also then yelled at for the same thing. I did get her to promise to use the insurance as an excuse but she would not see why it should have been the only option. She said that she works hard and doesn't need her children bitching at her since she is an adult.

Am I or are we the assholes for insisting on the promise from our mother and ""guilt tripping"" her. I love my mom and don't want to stress her out more but I want to protect my sister from W's outbursts. I honestly believe W needs to leave in general but that's a different can of worms."

c1demk	2019-06-16 18:51:24	BelieveInTadCooper	AITA for making my sister cry and then kicking her out of our(?) flat?	"My sister (28F) and I(31F) are very close and love each other dearly. We share a flat which is 5 minutes down the road from our parents' house. 

Growing up, both of us suffered from severe anxiety and depression which started in school and continued into college and beyond. Mine was far more visible, I threw more tantrums, had more breakdowns, and rebelled quite a bit. However, my parents are super-supportive and helped me get access to therapy, medication etc. and after years of consistent therapy, I was able to become independent, financially independent and move out of their house in order to live the life I want to lead. My sister on the other hand refused to go for therapy or see a psychiatrist - and her depression only continued to grow. 

Two years ago, when I moved into a bigger flat - my mother asked me whether I'd be ok to have my sister move in with me, because my parents felt that the independence and responsibilities would do my sister good. I agreed, and let my sister live with me. Since she doesn't earn as much as I do - I pay the bulk of rent and utilities and she pays what she can - which is about 15% of our total bills. 

This year, her depression got even worse to the extent that my parents intervened and asked her to move back in with them on the condition that she could return to our flat after she committed to therapy. Last week, she moved back in and when I asked her for her share of the bills - she got very upset and said she didn't have the money ... why am I springing this on her? she'll pay from next month... I got a little exasperated and told her she can either pay her share or she can move in when she can afford to. 

She said I'm not being supportive at a time when she really needs me burst into tears and left. AMITA for asking her to leave? I adore her and want her to get better. I could afford to pay for everything, and I know how much support I got from my parents at my lowest. But I feel like there's only this much support I am capable of giving her and she needs to figure the other stuff out with our parents. 

Some added context: It is very unusual in my country for unmarried kids to live apart from their parents. Even more so for girls. My parents are wonderfully supportive and liberal - but there are huge lifestyle differences between the life we the kids want to live and the one they lead. The implicit understanding has always been that if we want to do things our way, the least we can do, is to do it on our own dime - I gave my parents a lot of shit while living with them - which my sister does not (she is way more respectful of their rules). However when she stays with me, I feel like she gets extra freedom without actually having actually having to pay  for it and then I get resentful."	Not the A-hole	0	0	52.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

She moved away and that was the end of that, and I tried to forget about it. One day I checked his messages and realized he was talking to one of his friends about me, and not in a good way. When I confronted him, he said he didn't mean it. Again, I tried to move on but the lies still bothered me. He hides his cell phone from me and changes his passwords constantly.

My father and I have never really been close, he divorced my mom when I was a baby and I saw him every other weekend until I was about 14 or 15 during which we would just kind of awkwardly sit around and watch TV because we are practically opposites with him liking sports and hunting and me preferring books and computers ect.

Around that time the visits just started being shorter and farther apart and he made no effort to see me more often and stopped showing up for birthdays ect. Cut to me being 22 and my first child being born, my wife and I invited him to come see us and our newborn at the hospital or at home after we left which he said he would but then never did. I went to his house with my child and visited twice during the next year and told him we still lived at the same place and our number was the same but he still made no effort to reach out. After inviting him to my kids birthday he once again said he would be there but didn't come and just said he got busy when I asked why he didn't show.

Then my second child was born and same thing as before invited but never came at this point I will admit I stopped putting effort into involving my dad in our lives and in the last two years I have only spoken to him over the phone on fathers day and this year I don't even feel like doing that.

c1da66	2019-06-16 18:40:27	al_the_killer_	AITA - for not wanting to celebrate Father's day today	"My father in law passed away recently and he is due to be buried on Friday.

It's obviously a difficult time for my partner, and she asked If I would mind if we didn't do father's Day this year, (we have a 12 year old), I said yes, of course, I wasn't planning to make a big deal of it anyway. this has not been an issue, we spent today making final arrangements for her dad's funeral (picking pictures, and helping write the eulogy)

The problem started just before lunch today, my mother in a completely tone deaf way sent me a text message that simply read ""remember to phone your dad and wish him happy father's Day"", 

I have a complex relationship with my own father, and my Father in laws passing has opened up some old wounds and resentments that have probably been bubbling away for several years.

I texted her back to say that it wasn't a good time and continued about my day, only to be sent the same message again several hours later, neither of these messages bothered to enquire how my partner and my son are holding up.

I haven't replied... Yet, because every message I've written has been dropping with anger and sarcasm.

There have been a couple of other things that both my mother and other members of my family have done recently that have pissed me off, so this is just the icing on a very shitty cake.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to celebrate father's Day when my partner, my son and Hell, even I am hurting today?

My Mums side of the family basically never visited us or helped out their sister, and I had to deal with an unsupportive Father on top of things.

The week of the funeral every family member and even folk I hadn't met were there and the usual ""anything you need"" messages were there and of course I appreciated it. Time moved on and I descended into a very deep depression. I had to leave my full time job, and come to terms with my Dad having a new gf just a few months down the line (they were also having an affair while my Mum was alive). I tried my hardest to maintain contact with my Mums family because I wanted to feel part of a family, (i am an only child with not many friends) and enjoyed hearing stories about my Mum. However, most of the time I wanted to die and so would remain in bed and cancel on people alot. I found it really hard to pretend to be normal in social situations. 

Skip forward 2 years and since the week of the funeral I've seen them a handful of times. They said to my Dad that it is a two way street and I should have reached out to them. I know i have to make an effort too, but at the time I struggled just to stay alive and not injure myself. 

We do not speak now and I feel like they have completely abandoned me because I didn't get in touch with them or cancelled a few times when I felt shitty. (understatement.) I feel like I have no family now and am very upset about it as they are my Mums closest family members.

"A bit of background: I grew up Mormon, and my family still is, but I've since left the church (unofficially). In the Mormon Church, the first Sunday of every month they allow anybody to come up and talk about whatever they want in front of the congregation. My grandparents were visiting my family at the time of one of these congregations.
I've known I was transgender long before this, but I was always told by my parents to not tell my grandparents because they ""wouldn't take it well."" This slowly pissed me off more and more because it made me so dysphoric and anxious every time I saw them. I was treated in a way that always made me slowly hate myself, and even them and my parents. I was fed up. My grandparents were visiting me and my family for the weekend, and they decided to attend church with us. I sat there for awhile, preparing my little speech I'd read when I would walk up. The person speaking finished, and walked down back to their seat, and I built up enough courage to go up, and read. When I finished, I felt so euphoric and giggity, and I was later congratulated by both members who knew me, and members who had never spoken to me alike. I was proud. I went home happy for once. That didn't last long, though. My dad decided to come into my room, fuming. He ranted at me for coming out in front of my grandparents. I should have told them first, I shouldn't have done it in front of everyone, etc. etc. I was shattered. I felt like I had done something horribly wrong. I felt I was horribly wrong. My girlfriend calmed me down, and convinced me I was right to do what I did.
It didnt seem to matter in the long run, anyways, because my grandparents ended up treating me exactly as before, and my grandfather kept trying to convince me I wasnt transgender at all. I still wonder if I'm the asshole, though. I've wondered for years, and it still irks me to this day.

      My dad is not necessarily a ""great"" father.He has acted not so well around my brother and I for as long as I remember and was only active in our lives when he controlled the narrative.

 He has screamed at my brother in public places threatening to force feed him when my brother was below the age of 8 many times. My father also belittled me whenever I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at the age of 10 and proceeded to push me out of my comfort zone knowing I was not alright with it (causing a LOT of trauma) . Another occurance of him was when I would throw fits when I was about 4 (just like any 4 year old) he would film them and humiliate me by showing them at family dinners, taunting me, etc. At one point he got too frustrated because nobody picked up the phone when he called so he left for a week without telling us. I think you get the idea.

   As we grew older it was smaller things. For example yelling at my brother and I if we got any less than a 92 as a grade. Or being completely furious at us if we acted anyway that displeased him (ex. Sleeping in till 10am on the weekend). He is extremely agressive and unfair to everyone in the family including my mom (who is a saint to whom it may concern). 


  The thing that holds me back from completely saying he is a horrible guy is that he supports us financially. As children he would tell us that things were very expensive and we should love him because he bought us these things because we were ""poor"". We were never financially unfortunate but he made us think we were even though we were pretty well off. So this has ingrained a certain sense of ""Please don't spend money on me"" into my brother and I, even if it's just buying us lunch. I do awknowlege though that he has financially supported my family and that deserves thanks and do thank him for that frequently.

   I see him often and even though its just saying a phrase, to me it just sounds like I'm finally telling him that he actually is a good father. I understand that I am lucky to have somebody who financially supported me and I could easily have had a much worse father. But I still feel like he dosent desrve thanks for doing a good job
   


TL;DR: My father has caused my brother and I lots of trauma from a young age and is extremely arrogant, unfair, and agressive to my family. He supports our family financially and made my brother and I think he was some sort of superhero for doing it. I feel as though me wishing him happy fathers day would be telling him that he did a fantastic job and didn't fail in the ways he did.

c1d69y	2019-06-16 18:30:49		AITA for wanting to tell my best friend that his “girlfriend” screwed two of his other closest friends while they weren’t together?	"I’ve known Dan since first grade. We went through elementary, middle, and high school together. I graduated from college yesterday and he was there taking pictures with me and my family despite not even going to the same school—we’re basically brothers.

Here’s the problem: Dan dated this girl in the past, Hailey. Since then, they’ve broken up and gotten back together a dozen times (not exaggerating) and their “relationship” has spiraled into what can be best described as utter toxicity. They certainly have feelings for each other, even love each other perhaps, but bottom line is that they don’t work together and have an unhealthy relationship at the moment. This fact is clear to everyone around them but apparently not to themselves.

As of recently, Hailey went on an alcohol-induced self-destructive bender and ended up fucking not one but two of Dan’s other best friends (it is important to note that she and Dan were officially broken up during this time). As I’m typing this, Dan and her are back together and he’s about to spend the weekend at her place not knowing any of this information. I doubt she’ll ever tell him, but that’s besides the point here (I also blame the other friends, but that is also besides the point). If Dan found out about this, he would no doubt be furious and immediately stop talking to her. 

As his closest friend, I feel an obligation to tell him the truth (which would certainly alter his course of future actions). I also feel as if it’s none of my business to insert myself into a relationship that isn’t my own. I’m at an impasse because I feel like owe my best friend the truth of what happened and to save his future self from wasting any more time on this self-destructive girl, but I’m also afraid of starting a drama storm and hurting my friend in the process. 

WIBTA if I told him the truth of what happened between Hailey and his friends?

After sitting down and ordering our food, I decided to go out to the car to get medicine as I was having cramps. My friend goes with me, and as we’re looking through her purse to find the medicine, this guy standing outside his car is watching us. I thought nothing of it because we’ve been getting weird looks all day as we had went to the water park that morning, and we were wearing just a shirt and bikini bottoms. We go back inside, leaving the purse in the car, and eat dinner. 10 minutes later a waiter comes straight to us and asks if we drive a lime green jeep. My aunt and uncle say yes and they get up to see what they took. The window of the door that my friend and I were at was broken, and so was the back windshield. They stole the purse, my wallet (with my ID and debit card in it), and all of my uncle’s art. They also had a lockbox with all the money they’ve earned this weekend. 

Now why may I be the asshole? My grandma and grandpa are putting the blame on me for the car getting broken into. They say I should pay for them to get their windows fixed (insurance won’t cover it), and for the art and money that got stolen. I said that it’s ridiculous for me to take 100% of the blame and pay for everything. I see that it’s all of our faults, but I don’t think I should pay for everything. I offered to pay some, but my aunt & uncle don’t want me to.

He is the most amazing man and always spoils me for mother's day, my birthday, anniversary, and everything. I feel so guilty I forgot. I feel like the worst wife ever.

c1d2b3	2019-06-16 18:21:16	throwawAITAy	AITA for choosing my best friend over my girl friend	"Throwaway for obvious reasons

For the length of this story my best friend (F) will be Ly. My girlfriend (F) (now ex) will be Db and I will of course be Me (M)

Backstory : Before meeting Ly I was a mess. I was obese and was pretty much a dick to a lot of people. By the time I realized it, I didnt have very many friends. The few I had tolerated me. Even they stopped after a while. They still remained friends but it wasn't real friendship. I was also extremely sad at this time. Not depressed or atleast I think not. I used to cry myself to sleep for so many nights wishing not to be lonely. My parents are literal Angels but I couldn't share this stuff with them. I wasn't comfortable for reasons that are whole other story. Then I met Ly who not only tolerated me but inspired me to be a better version of myself. She helped me lose weight and feel comfortable in my own skin again. Now on to the main part

So Ly and I have been best friends for a while now . It's been about a year. I met Db a couple months ago. We hit it off and started going out. Ly was very happy for me. She wanted to get to know Db and all that stuff. So we all went out together once. Db was normal and nothing much happened. After that anytime Ly or I tried to set up something for the 3 of us, she'd find excuses to get out of it. Then she started trying to get me to spend less time with Ly. Db would deliberately ask me to hangout with her when she knew I had plans with Ly already. When I'd ask if the 3 of us can spend time together, she'd say she wanted alone time with me. I didnt mind that. I did spend more time with Db. Eventually I even got her to hangout with the three of us again. She was reluctant at first and then rude to Ly when we met. She was being unnecessarily rude mocking Ly and shit like that. I pulled her aside and asked what was wrong. Turns out she was jealous of Ly. I tried to assure her that Ly and I are just friends and she had nothing to worry about. She wouldn't budge. This slowly turned into a fight which ended with her saying, ""Okay it's either me or her pick now!"". I was genuinely surprised at this. I didnt think about it. I told her we were done. I picked Ly. I would again. She's not just my best friend, she's family to me. Db threw a lot of profanities my way before eventually leaving.

Was I wrong? Was I too harsh? I ask this because when she asked me to pick, I took like 3 seconds to answer. I told her she needed to leave and that we were done. Also I'm sorry this turned out to be so long!"	No A-holes here	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1d20j	2019-06-16 18:20:32	HomoErectus76	AITA for getting annoyed at my wife for accidentally smashing my iPad?	So little backstory last December I got a small bonus from work. I am normally very frugal with my money and never spend much on myself. Both myself and wife had been talking of getting an iPad and with the new one coming out (iPad pro) she said I should treat myself to it. It’s technically mine but we both use it often. Anyways earlier today I hear an ‘oops’ from the other room and then she tells me she has dropped a plug on the screen. I have a look at it and the entire screen is completely knackered. As I inspect it she goes ‘oops clumsy me’ and walks off. We are busy for a few hours and later on when we have chance to talk about it I wait for her to bring it up. She doesn’t and I eventually address it where she very non chalantly tells me she knows she messed up but there’s isn’t anything she can do about it.

c1d1u0	2019-06-16 18:20:02		AITA for accusing my mom of being on drugs?	"I live with my mom. Yesterday, I picked her up from her friend’s house, and she seemed kind of weird. Dramatic, more talkative, something just seemed up. I thought maybe she was drunk at first, but she wasn’t. This isn’t the first time she’s acted weird after staying with her friend. I used to be on speed, and that’s how she kind of seemed to me. 

When we got home, she was all happy and saying she was going to cook, and laid some meat out. Then maybe an hour later, she went into the bathroom and never came out. She was in there for about four hours before I went to bed, and asked to her to put the meat up if she wasn’t going to cook. When I got up the next morning, she was still in the bathroom. The meat was still laying out. Everything was untouched. She had not come out of that bathroom. I thought she was passed out or dead in there.

I knocked on the door and told her she left the meat sitting out all night, and she groggily said she would put it up. I then texted her a bit later, and asked if she was on something because I don’t know how she’s stayed in the bathroom all night. She told me not to worry about what she does and she’s tired of me being a smartass. I told her I was genuinely concerned, and wasn’t trying to be smart. She then told me to take my judgemental, perfect, tattletale bullshit on and get a life. My mom can be a bitch, but she usually isn’t this mean over me just showing concern. She told me she didn’t come out because she’s sick of the house being a mess and sick of my daughter (baby daughter, I might add) screaming and crying.

c1d1pz	2019-06-16 18:19:44		WIBTA if I don't tell my friend about our mutual friend's birthday dinner?	"This question primarily concerns myself and 2 of my friends, Marcus and Seymour. All of us are males in our late 20s.

The three of us have known each other since grade school, and have remained good friends throughout most of our lives. We are currently all living in the same area so it's pretty easy for us all to hang out together and we frequently do but we are not all attached at the hip by any means. It wouldn't be totally out of place for only two of us to get together without the third guy, for instance. Seymour and I have made our way into our own careers and are doing well for ourselves financially. I wouldn't consider myself wealthy by any stretch of the term, but I have a bit of flexibility in my budget to spend a little extra on food, clothes, travel, etc. Unfortunately it has been a little harder for Marcus to find gainful employment, he's been in and out of work for the last couple of years which affects the things he's able to do when we all hang out together. 

This brings me to the crux of the issue: Seymour recently had a birthday and to celebrate he wants to go to a nicer restaurant in town that is somewhat expensive. He called me to invite my fiancee and I, and as I was about to ask if he's also going to invite Marcus he told me ""Let's keep this on the down-low. I don't like excluding Marcus but I know if I invited him he wouldn't refuse, and I don't think he's in a position to be spending this much on a dinner right now."" He has made the reservations, and the dinner is scheduled for next week. Included on the invite is another friend who I've never met before, so there will be 6 of us attending at this point (3 couples). 

Initially my stance was that as it's Seymour's birthday dinner it's absolutely his choice who makes it onto the guest list and who doesn't, and I still think this to some extent, but I also think that sooner or later Marcus will find out about the dinner and I think there's some very real potential for hurt feelings here. I know Seymour is right that Marcus would agree to come along, and I think in some way Seymour's heart is in the right place, but I also think that it should be Marcus' own decision what he does with his money and that making that decision for him without even consulting him is rude and a little condescending. I'm also not sure it's really my place to bring it up to Marcus though.

c1d0uh	2019-06-16 18:17:41	malfoysykes	AITA if I called my boyfriend out over hsi attitude towards my birthday present?	"My birthday is in a week, and bf has been saying that he didn't know what to get me. I'm not a fan of knick knacks or decor in general, so I thought about what I needed and I told him I would need a new pressed powder compact. He asked me to go with to Sephora so I could pick it out and he would pay for it, but I said no, I would send him the pictures of the one I'm currently using and he can go pick out something similar at the shop (I'm open to trying brands), and can ask the staff for help. Basically he has all the info he needs - my shade, matte finish etc. He hemmed and hawed about it then dropped the subject.

&#x200B;

This afternoon we went for a lunch with my family, and afterwards we found a Sephora. I went to their makeup bar, picked out my shade and told him, ""This is my shade, go and find something"". He then said that I already picked something out, so let's just go pay for it, how much is it? At this point I'm like ???? aren't you supposed to pick something out for me? Wasn't the whole point of this to show that you want to put in *some* effort into my present? But nevermind.

&#x200B;

It was $22 (cheap-ish compared to a lot of my makeup) then he said, ""Ok that's not too bad you wanna get anything else?"" and so I picked out a KVD lipliner and we went straight to pay. The cashier asked if I wanted to use my 10% loyalty discount and I said yes, and the total came out to almost $50. Bf coughed and exclaimed at the price, then took out his wallet rather reluctantly and paid. I kissed him and said thanks for the present but he shook me away and walked off, then had a black face for the rest of the day, and ignored me in the 30 minute cab ride we were taking to visit a friend.

&#x200B;

For context, he's not opposed to buying me makeup -  he bought me the UD Game of Thrones eyeshadow palette with a pop-up Iron Throne just for kicks a while back because we both love the series, and I think it's in the $100 range. He's also bought me other makeup items for Christmas etc.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if it's a money issue (he makes a bit more money than me), or there was something else on his mind that made him grumpy, but the fact that it was for my birthday and he seems so angry about the present makes me pretty upset. He's also been very non-conversational and barely texted since we left our friend's place and went back to our separate homes, and I feel like I need to call him out, but it would inevitably result in a  f i g h t  and that's something I want to avoid.   


I feel like he's the asshole for giving this attitude completely out of the blue, but I'm not sure and I want to clarify. AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0	59.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

Normally for any special holidays such as his birthday or Father’s Day I plan and make sure he nice a day with gifts from me and the kids. I always go out of my way to make sure it’s something he would enjoy. I make plans for us to go out or if we are staying home I make sure we are making his favorite meal and have his favorite beer. 

We have been together for about 4 years and he has never reciprocated anything like this. I usually make my own plans for birthdays and almost never receive a card or gift. Last year for my birthday he took me out to a concert but it was an event that I originally planned for me and my best friend and he just tagged along. We have talked about how him not making effort hurts my feelings and he has not made any effort to change. 

So this year I decided I was not going to plan anything. He has made it apparent all morning that I didn’t do anything. At one point he even mentioned “it’s my day” so what are we doing today.  He has made me feel guilty about it all morning.

I serve in an open base (I can go home everyday), he's in a close base (can go home on weekends). We haven't really spoken since the course ended, and now he hit me up asking if I can ask my boss (captain?) If he can transfer him to my office so he can go home everyday. 

My boss is kind of weird and and we don't have the best relationship, plus I know it's super difficult to transfer to my base. I feel like I'd come off as rude asking my boss for a favor when I've been there for as little as I have and basically done nothing because of complications with my security check. 

So, AITA for not wanting to help him out? Writing this down kinda makes me think I am but I've never been in an office ""job"" and I don't know if asking for your friends to get ""hired"" like this is rude

Edit: so right now all of the comments are saying NTA which kinda surprised me. How is it not assholish from me?

c1cyih	2019-06-16 18:12:07	glamblarg999	AITA for not helping my girlfriend's parents?	"I've been dating Liz for about 8 years. She's very close with her parents, and I'm on pretty good terms with them as well. In between my own housing situations, I actually lived with the three of them for a few months in the past. I helped pay rent, which I soon found out saved them from a pending eviction.

Liz's parents were recently actually evicted after her father lost his job for medical reasons. Her mother also has had long bouts with a different cancers, so on top of the loss of income, they are both drowning in medical debts because fuck American healthcare. Less relevant, but I think still important, is that during all this, they've adopted numerous animals, bought new cars, and even talked Liz into also buying a new car from their preferred dealership. Generally, I hate when people shame poor people's spending habits, but spending habits are also taught. I grew up poor and it's been a huge struggle learning good habits, and it's been really frustrating trying to get Liz on the same page when her parents talk her into 60 month loans for new cars...

Since their eviction two months ago, Liz's parents have been bouncing between extended stay hotels while they try and save enough money for a down payment on long term housing. Meanwhile, we have an upcoming (free through school) trip to Europe scheduled. Her parents asked her if we'd be okay with them staying in our apartment for the week we'll be gone. She relayed the question to me and I steadfastly said no.

I like her parents. I think they're good people going through an awful situation, almost all of which is beyond their control. If nothing else, I'm not comfortable with anyone being in my house without us there. But there is more. Nothing against her parents, but people that are desperate tend to make bad decisions. What if I come home and find something of ours pawned? I definitely have people in my own family that would do that, and I'm just not willing to risk it. That's actually very close to how I lost my first car. Or, what if after we come back, they refuse to leave? They've already started getting mail sent here without my knowledge or permission, including a civil summons for unpaid debt. What if they try and claim tenancy? Am I going to have to call the cops on them? Start an eviction procedure? Get a lawyer? Her parents had the exact same thing happen to them with Liz's grandmother, and without any prompting, preemptively assured her that that wouldn't happen. Which just tells me it is a thought that they've had?

This apparently came to a head last night at Liz's brother's birthday party, which I couldn't go do because work. Apparently they made a big deal about how disappointed they are in me for not trusting them, not wanting to help them in their time of need, etc. Which, I guess is true. I feel like shit that I'm not willing to help them, but... I'm also not willing to risk what Elizabeth and I have built up.

**Edited since it keeps coming up**: Liz's parents kind of got me kicked out because of bedbugs. Fucking bedbugs. It's been like 5 years and I'm still traumatized. Her parents got bedbugs, kept it secret while they tried to treat it themselves (which is more or less impossible), and they quickly spread into Liz's bedroom, then through us into my apartment before we actually noticed. When this was discovered my landlord gave me one month's notice to move. I moved almost all my stuff into a storage unit, moved in with them for a few awful months, and then when we moved out we got all our possessions gassed to kill then. Fuck. Bedbugs."

"I’ll try to make this short but basically I’m(20F) subletting a place near my college until I move into my apartment for the semester. I live with my father(41M) in another apartment an hour away. Lately we haven’t gotten along for reasons that are too hard to put into words. Anyways he’s controlling and limits my car usage so I’m basically stuck in the apartment all day without anything to do. I love working and being productive but my depression has definitely gotten worse since I’ve moved back into his place in May. My father has a bit of an anger issue, I’ve told him to go to therapy but he insists that he’s fine. Anyways I’m moving out because of his treatment towards me. I do have a lot of stuff at his place so I do plan on moving some of it but I’m not really attached to some stuff (i.e stuffed animals, books, a desk). I don’t care what he does with them if he throws a fit and destroys them. But I’m terrified of telling him that I won’t be living there. WIBTA if I just suddenly don’t show up to the apartment anymore? That I’ve moved out?

c1cwfi	2019-06-16 18:07:07		AITA for fighting with my mom and calling her out during an extended family trip?	"So my mom and I always had a weird relationship. 

And these were the some of the most relevant events that happened before the whole fighting

She would always get mad at the littlest things. For example when I was in 5th grade she shouted at me for having bad handwriting and I proceeded to cry in my room for a few hours then she called me later and shouted at me again for crying.

She sent me to a catholic school and I asked her if I could transfer to this school that wasn’t catholic. She told me no because she said that the school doesn’t teach good catholic values and started hitting me and shouting at me cause I wasn’t happy about staying in the school. This pissed me off especially because we don’t even go to church and she was being a hypocrite for telling me that I should follow the schools values and the school teaches us to go to church 

My mom always tells me to get out of the house (in a get out of this family and don’t come back kinda way) whenever she gets angry with us and one time I got tired of all my siblings talking down at me and gaming up on me so I decided to leave the house and it led to a whole thing where she started shouting at me when she brought me back even thought she keeps threatening to get out.




So it all lead up to an event where we just arrived in a country and I was getting annoyed by my brother because he constantly talked me down just because of the clothes I wear and I started ranting to him then my mom tells us to stop fighting. My brother says sorry and I don’t. She tells me something about “oh your brother said sorry but you didn’t” and I said that i’ll only day sorry if I mean it and that my brother just said sorry to get out of trouble and doesn’t actually mean and that he was talking behind your back about how bad she is. She proceeded to tell me that it doesn’t matter if he doesn’t mean it and that it’s okay to talk behind people’s back. She then said she would leave me behind in the trip. Then I said “go ahed” then she told me to leave her house and I told her that I already tried and that I wanted you. She then said “fuck you” and it just exploded to a whole fight talking about the past and how I had problems with her but never told her because she would get so fucking pissed."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

my dad is going out to visit my brother for father’s day and i was going to go with him so i came down in shorts, a t shirt and a jacket. he immediately started screaming at me, telling me i can’t go with him if i don’t change that i don’t look normal, i look hideous, i need to change into ‘appropriate clothing’ or i’m not going anywhere with him ever. he only ever does this when my mom is not home. when she’s home, he knows to back off because she’ll tell him that he’s being unreasonable. 

i asked him why i don’t ‘look normal’ and how this is inappropriate. he just screamed at me that i’m a selfish bitch and slammed the door in my face. i was going to go upstairs to change because i want to see my brother but he left without me. i know it’s father’s day and it’s his day and all but i don’t feel that it’s fair that he’s calling me inappropriate for wearing shorts in 80° weather when my mom said i’m allowed to.

c1cvpk	2019-06-16 18:05:26	fathersdayguilt	AITA for cutting my father out of my life with no explanation?	"So, my parents divorced when I was about three years old. My dad moved about six hours away after that. I'm an only child, if that makes any difference. 

Throughout my childhood, my father was supposed to visit one a month. He probably only made that about half the time -- sometimes he would call my mom an hour after he was supposed to be there to say he wasn't coming, and often my mom ended up finding out that he had come down, but was just doing something else instead (hunt camp, visiting family, etc.)

I was obsessed with my dad as a kid, so it broke my heart every time. 

As I got older, I started to see the negative side of him. He is very violent and angry (though he never physically harmed me). Nothing I ever did was good enough. He has an alcohol problem and is extremely racist and homophobic (I'm bisexual and most of my friends are LGBT). But he was my dad, and I loved him. 

The older I got, the less effort he put into the relationship. And I get it: he got remarried, he had (step) grandchildren, and we had less and less in common. But with that came getting my birthday wrong two years in a row (""I didn't forget, I just left my phone in the car""), not bothering to invite me to family gatherings that he attended and leaving my college graduation halfway through because he hadn't planned ahead to actually take time off around it. 

The last time I saw him was around Christmas two years ago. My partner and I went to dinner with him. He insulted my career, was extremely rude to the waitress, telling her her degree was worthless (which happened to be the same degree my partner had, who was literally right there) and then forgot the gift we got him at the table when he left. 

I spent most of that night crying, and decided I didn't want my father in my life anymore. I have not spoken to or seen him since. He has reached out and said ""hi"" maybe two or three times since then. I have not opened the messages.

c1cse5	2019-06-16 17:57:46		AITA for not wanting to be in a movie with my sister?	Okay kind of weird question, but here it is. This whole month I've been volunteering at an organization that fits the job I'm in college for to get shadowing hours and I'm very passionate about it. Over the last few years, me and my sister have been doing lots of extra work in movies, but haven't worked in over a year. We recently got booked for a scene where we'd be sitting in an audience with probably hundreds of over people. Now, I've done these types of scenes before and honestly hate them. It takes hours to get everyone ready to film, then we sit in the crowd for 8-12 hours while getting shitty food, then wait another hour in line to get our vouchers and leave the set. My sister really wants to do it though, and she's never been on a set without me and is nervous to do so. The filming day falls on one of my volunteer days and we only have one car, so I'll have to cancel that whether I do the movie or not. My mom is saying just to go with her and get easy money, but honestly, no part of it sounds appealing. But if I don't go, I have nothing to do that day since I can't volunteer. Should I just go with her? AITA if I don't? Again, I know it's a weird thing to ask, but I overthink everything.		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1cqfg	2019-06-16 17:52:58		AITA for telling this girl to go fuck herself?	"So I went out last night to a bar 15 minutes away. I get there at a good time because right after I did 8-10 people walk in and sit all around me.  There are probably 3 couples in there and 1 apparently single girl, a brunette who I'll call Jenny.  So I'm just drinking my drink and this Emily (one with a boyfriend) starts talk-shouting at her friend that she should come over and talk to me and that I am totally Jenny's type. Its taking a long time so I am right away thinking this girl isn't into me and is just being pressured into it.  


Note this is their prepartation part.  So the inevitable happens and they both saunter over and sandwich me on either side of m bar stool.  Drunky, loud, taken Emily starts talking to me to break the ice and I'm being playful and flirty with both of them.  Eventually I run out of surface level game so a few minutes in I start deconstructing how terrible she is at being a wingman.  That she was way too loud, and the plan sucked, and that her friend didn't even have an interest in me from the start so there was nothing organic to build on.  I should mention this brunette girl walked away *the second* I told Emily that I was forced to listen to her shouted coversation for the last 10 minutes.

&#x200B;

So after Emily processes what I said and thought up a remark, she came out and tells me that it's actually so obvious that I'm not her friends type and that she deserves somebody better than me and better looking. Just drinking my beer trying to wait for this piercing-voiced harpy to leave my side.  My blood gets hot and I lean in to her and whisper, ""Go fuck yourself"", so that only she heard.  It sure was satisfying.  I don't say anything for probably 2 minutes after while she keeps asking follow up questions, aghast and confused at how I came to that reaction.  Just drinking my beer waiting for her boyfriend to come tell her to leave me alone.    


She's not leaving and I eventually lose my mental from her follow up questions and explain to her in exactitude how she's a terrible wingman and being a bitch to me just because her friend didn't like me, so she rationalizes that it was me not being a good enough man that did that and not her ham-fisted, drunken attempts to play matchmaker.  


I basically said I can't do this anymore and ask the bartender to close out my tab.  She get's the message then and leaves back to the other side of the bar with her friends to I hope do some contemplation and self-reflection.

My parents want me to come back home to my home country. Their main reasons for this are 1. It is my home country hence my duty to come 'help the economy' and such. 2. The culture in US is not appropriate for raising kids (I come from a conservative family) 3. The 'white people' will never accept you as you own.
I find all of the reasons bull crap. I send money to my parents every month (they don't need it, nor request it, but I do anyway) so that should help the economy. Also, I don't feel I own anything to my home country given i have faced so many hardships and what not due to corruption, poverty, etc.
I find the culture in US just perfect, live and let live.
The 'white people' (They just meant everyone living there, it wasn't a racial thing) have treated me with respect and kindness more than half the people in my own country.
I might have other reasons to go back, like take care of my parents, help them etc, but at this stage it's not needed. So I clearly told them two days back, that I don't give a F about my home country as such. This upset them a lot, and they said things to me like being unpatriotic, ungrateful etc.

c1cmc7	2019-06-16 17:43:15	noumadic	AITA - A friend not so in need.	"Sorry for the long post, but I need to get this out here.

So I've been rolling with an xbox group since our early teens. All of us met about 8 months after halo reach and have been gaming together ever since. There were MANY bumps in the road but each one made our friendship stronger until recent years. From playing to our early teens to trying to schedule nights for some fun times in our early adulthood, we haven't really been the same. Our usual friendly banter and inside jokes aged like wine, or it did until reality set in and depression came out of nowhere. I found out that one of our friends in the group was going through a rough time with his parents, girlfriend, and job. I wont get into the details out of respect for him. 6 of us, including me, all jumped on and tried to cheer him up with a nostalgia run on Halo Reach. This is where things went south. Before I hopped on or even heard about my friends issues, I was having very dark thoughts and wasn't in the best mindset to help out. The need of wanting to help and try to cheer myself up in the process didnt work so well. As I joined, I was already made the group punching bag. Personal attacks about my sexuality, how I barely go out due to having no friends or people my age, and my appearance. The friend that we were originally trying to help out jumped in on this and I couldn't take it anymore. I left and never came back. I removed them from everything I could except the friend that was going through some stuff to make sure he was alright. I called everyone in the group a fake friend, and never wanting anything to do with the group anymore. Moments like this weren't uncommon but that was the last straw. The others say that I was being too sensitive and cant take a joke like I used too. Am I the asshole for suddenly cutting ties like that?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	71.0	14.0	0.0	0.0

c1ckh2	2019-06-16 17:38:40	flatmatesucks	AITA for not tipping?	"Obviously a whole load of Americans are going to be immediately replying 'Yep, definitely'. 

Hang on.

&#x200B;

I'm in the UK - where minimum wage is enforced and waiters etc don't typically rely on tips in the same way American staff do. Tipping HAS gotten more common here but it's not as much of a foregone conclusion as it is in America. Typically a waitress here is making about the same per hour as I am.

&#x200B;

Part of my job is to take disabled clients out in the community, often this means a meal out somewhere the client chooses. With some clients I get to claim back a portion of my meal costs. To get that I HAVE to submit a receipt. In cases where I get to claim back costs I do NOT get to claim back tips to restaurant staff. It's the same with taxis - I can get taxi expenses repaid in certain circumstances but I can only claim for the actual taxi fare and not the tip. I've had taxi drivers hold onto my change before assuming it's their tip and I've mostly just sighed and let it go rather than offend them.

Anyway, on Friday my client chose a nice Italian restaurant. I spent about £5 on garlic bread and pepsi while my client ate a full meal with dessert (about £20). Bills come, I put down the money for mine, he puts in his money. While my client is getting ready to leave I go up to the counter to hand over the cash - the staff member at the counter looks at the bill, the money and she tells me 'the tip wasn't included by the way, that's additional' and she waits. I'm like 'is a tip mandatory?' and she tells me 'it's encouraged' and when I hesitate - '20% is what most people pay'. I slowly pull out a fiver and hand it to her.

Now I have basically paid £10 for pepsi and garlic bread. I don't have a receipt for this tip so I can't claim it back from my employer OR ask my support client for his share.

Most of my clients have intellectual disabilities and would not understand why someone was asking them for more money than the bill says. If I had gone back to my client and said 'the waitress needed more money on top of what was on the bill and I paid her £5 so you owe me £2.50.' the client would find that strange and would probably think I was trying to scam him. Me asking for money from a client for something I don't have a receipt for would likely get me investigated. AND even if WAS on the receipt my share of that tip isn't something I can claim back from my employer. So even if I got another receipt for that £5 I wouldn't be able to claim any part of it from my employer as it's a discretionary payment and not my employer's responsibility.

AITA for not EXPECTING to tip and not WANTING to? This waitress was more blatant than most staff would be but do wait staff in general think I'm being an asshole when I don't tip? And is there a way to deal with this? 

This job can already be quite expensive to do as even when I get expenses they don't always cover the costs fully anyway.

I'm especially interested in responses from wait staff."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c1cjrh	2019-06-16 17:36:51		AITA for walking out on a date and not paying for her food?	"For some background, I've never had a girlfriend, so as a result I'm still a virgin. Recently, my friends set me up on a date with a girl they went to high school with. I met their friend at a party (let's call her Cara) and we scheduled a date. I'd never been on a date, so I figured I might as well go for it.

We decided to meet up for dinner. During the date, we talked about movies, video games, etc. Soon she started talking about her ex-boyfriends and asked me about my ex's. I told her I didn't have an ex since I always focused on school. She responded by asking if I was a virgin, to which I answered yes. She then said to me ""experience is always a good thing"" and started talking about how I should start having sex ASAP. I told her that I was fine with waiting til I was in a relationship and am not interested in casual sex. She seemed weirded out and said that I should ""live a little"" while I'm still young. She kept talking about how girls prefer experienced guys and how I should explore my sexuality.

At this point, I was starting to get a little annoyed. It was clear that we weren't on the same page, so I decided to end the date. I told her that I didn't appreciate her telling me what to do with my body. She responded by saying that if I act like I'm scared of sex, I'll stay a virgin. At that point, I stood up, paid for my food, and left without saying another word. This happened last night and I haven't heard from her or her friends yet. I'm wondering if ITA.

c1cfoz	2019-06-16 17:27:13	Middnight_sun	AITA for ending a friendship over text and refusing to speak to her on the phone even though she threatened to call the police (and did) for a welfare check	"This happened last year but it still bothers me now. So I (34F) had a friend (Rachel) who I’d been friends with for 13 years. She always had a lot of drama going on with her relationships and towards the end of our friendship she became quite paranoid and always thought people were out to get her (mainly her current fella’s wife and kids who he cheated on to be with her). During the time I knew her she had two affairs which resulted in broken relationships on both sides (when I’m typing this now I realise how bad her behaviour was but at the time she always justified everything in a way that made it seem ok - I was a bit naive and easily led back then).

Gradually I got to a point where I realised I’d outgrown the friendship and I started dreading seeing her because of all the drama. At first I distanced myself a little but the more I did the more she asked if there was something wrong. So one day when she’d text me a couple of times (we rarely spoke on the phone, our main form of communication was by text) I thought it best to be honest so I explained how I thought the friendship had run its course and that I wanted us to go our separate ways. I apologised and wished her the best. I can’t remember exactly how her response was worded but it was quite patronising, like she was assuming I’d had a breakdown which had caused me to end the friendship and she said she’d check in on me every so often to make sure I was doing ok. Before I had chance to reply things escalated...

I received a couple of calls, one from an unknown number and one from a withheld number, neither of which I answered. I then got another text from Rachel saying she didn’t believe it was actually me who had sent the texts and that she wanted me to call her to confirm it was me. I replied and said I was sorry the situation was causing her upset but asked her to respect my wishes. She responded and said again that she didn’t believe it was me and that she was worried for my safety. She said that unless I called her by 6pm she would call the police. I felt she was trying to manipulate me into calling her so I didn’t respond and didn’t think she would actually call the police. Anyway, she did and they called me to check I was ok so I explained the situation to them and that was the end of it. I’ve not spoken to her since.  

I feel bad for the waste of police time which could have been avoided if I’d just called her but to be honest I didn’t want to as she could be quite patronising and manipulative and I’m not sure how that conversation would have gone. 

The thing is, I keep wondering whether I was the asshole and should have just grown some balls and called her (especially since we’d been friends for so long) or whether it was actually her who was the asshole for being paranoid and overdramatic.

I also have a friend who we will call Chloe. She went to school with Emma....I went to a different school to them, and they were really close when they were like 15/16.

I work with Chloe often now though because we’re in the same industry and we get along really well. 

They fell out at 16 after Chloe slept with Emma’s boyfriend. I’ve spoken to Chloe about this and she admits that what she did was awful and that she was just an insecure mess back then. She seems like she’s a really good person now and I feel like it was just a stupid immature thing she did but she was young. 

When I told Emma I was working with Chloe now she was like ‘ugh gross’. I said she’s actually really nice, and she said she really regrets what she did to you. Emma was like to me, she’s a narcissist she’ll pretend to be nice to you but she’s a bitch trust me. I said well she doesn’t seem that way and Emma was like, well you’re stupid she’s not a nice person. 

Since telling her about the fact I’m friends with Chloe she’s been really off with me, and she’s made a few comments about me betraying her, we’re in out 20s now and I feel like she’s just being really petty like we’re in high school or something.

c1cefs	2019-06-16 17:24:12	DelusionalDaffodil	AITA in this wedding drama	"So my sister is due to get married this August. Since she got engaged she has become a major bridezilla. So bit of back story, me my partner and my son all moved about a 4 hour drive from our hometown. This makes attending the wedding tricky. When my sister first was planning, she didn't take our financial situation into account. My partner was the only one working (since March luckily we have found work around each other to avoid expensive childcare costs) and she expected me to spend £350 on just the hen do which she wanted abroad (train tickets on top are £80 each way). I told her obviously this was unrealistic as we had roughly £30 spare a month and that was for extras like clothes etc. She kicked up a massive fuss, telling me I was an awful sister etc. So she changed the hen do to closer to home, although still about 3 hours away. The cost? Still around the £300 mark without my train tickets and cost of food etc as she wanted to do all these expensive things. She kicked up a massive fuss again when I said I couldn't go.

She then started getting very tight with her budget as she blew 10k on just the venue. She gave me £25 to find my son a suit and shoes. I told her it just wasn't doable. The cheapest suit alone (she wants an uncommon colour) was £20 and smart shoes are looking around £20+ (he is the page boy). We got into an argument about money and didn't talk for ages.

So fast forward to March, a couple weeks after my job, she invites me to a mini hen do in my home town in the middle of May, giving me 3 weeks to save the £160 for train tickets plus around another £150 while I'm there. She then has another go at me as I told her it's too short notice and I had literally just started my job.

Now is the disaster of the bridesmaid dress. So I get my size, except these are from China so cheap material and they have these weird sewn in boob cups which are about 6 sizes too small. I have endlessly asked her about getting a bigger size dress for that reason, and she kept going on and on about getting a full body spanx suit to supposedly suck my boobs into place. Gets to last week and she finally agrees to send me a message about where she got the dress etc and then tells me that they won't arrive for 6-8 weeks and the wedding is in about 6 -1/2 weeks.

So now I am stuck with a dress that doesn't fit. The expense of getting to the wedding. Her wanting me to spend a week there. My sons outfit costs and her attitude every couple weeks getting on at me about all sorts of things. I can definitely say this has put me off getting married.

Tldr My sister is getting angry at me as I cannot afford to participate in her expensive events and is giving me unrealistic expectations."	Not enough info	0	0	6.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

Anyways, on to what actually happened. 

So, I have an interent friend, who we'll call Samantha. Samantha is constantly upset, usually because she thinks that nobody loves her/or that everybody hates her. Something in that general range. I, along with many, many other people, have commented on her vents, and tried to reach out to her. 

Before these vents started (she did vent a bit before I met her, but not as much) I became good friends with her, and would try my best to comfort her whenever she seemed upset or sad about something. 

Eventually, she stopped responding to my messages. Of course, I didn't get mad and simply assumed she was busy or doing something. Quickly, time passed, and it had been three weeks since she replied to my messages. She was consistently active and posting vents about how ""no body loves her""

Finally, I worked up the courage to text her again (I have a weird fear that people will dislike me if I text too much/even once every couple of weeks-), and told her how I was sorry to hear about the things she vented about, and that I hope she feels better soon and that i'll be here to talk of she needs me too. It's been a week, and she still hasn't responded, but is continuing to vent about how she's lonely (remember, a lot of people have offered to listen to her and try to help - but she ignored them)

Now, i'm just wondering if I should leave the chat we're in. I'm starting to think that she's lost interest in the chat, and that she won't care if I leave. I'm just a bit scared that maybe she'll get upset if I leave. So, Reddit, WIBTA if I just left and cut her off?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	42.0	20.0	0.0	0.0

c1cd5d	2019-06-16 17:21:11		AITA for cutting off my therapist after telling him he’s shitty?	"Hi everyone. I am a 24 year old female and I am married to a 26 year old male who is my entire world. We do everything together. Everything. Usually when I get up to go to the bathroom my husband tells me he’ll miss me. Its ridiculous but it’s the way we work and I love it. We have been married almost 5 years, with no kids. We truly just love and adore each other to no end. When some people say they need decent time apart from their significant others, we are confused by that because we love spending every moment we can with each other. For a long time we even worked next to each other, but I quit that job for my health. 

That’s not to say we don’t spend time apart. I go out with friends and he goes out with friends and we have a good time doing so and then we go back to regular life. 

Anyways, I see a therapist for PTSD from repeated childhood trauma and depression. My PTSD is bad enough that I have a service dog to help me through my panic attacks and flashbacks. Usually I take my husband and obviously my dog with me to my counseling sessions. 

At my last session, my therapist told me that the relationship I have with my husband is unhealthy because of how attached we are to each other. He said we have to consider what will happen if we break up, and that he wants me to be more independent and to learn to be by myself, not in a marriage. He says it is important for me to recover from my trauma and that it will help me immensely to take care of myself in every way, including romantic support. He said I have to love myself. He finished by suggesting a trial separation!

I panicked immediately and my husband got angry. He told my therapist that he didn’t think the therapist had a right to be making that call and that there was nothing wrong with our relationship.

c1cctv	2019-06-16 17:20:20	anonymouslocal	AITA for asking my partner to pay in for the right to have his name on the mortgage?	"I’m gonna try and keep this short and sweet. 

My partner and I have been together several years, living together for two. I bought our house before I met him and have always been financially independent. He pays half of the mortgage and half bills. 

We’re currently discussing moving closer to his new job. And here’s the issue: he wants his name on the mortgage of the new place. The sale of the current house will more than cover a deposit for a new one, and he says that since he’s been paying towards this mortgage, he has a right to be on the lease without contributing anything extra. 

By my reckoning, over two years he’s paid approximately 5k to the mortgage. Over five years of me owning the house, plus the deposit, I’ve paid 40k, as well as shelling out for Major house improvements that have increased the value of the property. I feel like it’s my right to ask him to contribute half of what the new deposit will be, or allow me to withdraw the ‘extra’ that I’ve paid for my own use.

Now let me be clear: we have a good relationship. I don’t expect us to break up. But I graduated 10 years ago and he’s only recently done the same (I’m a few years older and took a degree, he’s got a PhD). I work two jobs with the intention of paying off my mortgage young (he asked me why once and seemed genuinely confused by the concept), whereas he’s a lot less life ambitious. I think that if we’re buying a house together, he should contribute as much as I have—whereas he wants to be included without working for it.

c1c9tw	2019-06-16 17:12:55	Firebirds4sparx	AITA for telling my Mom's Wife that I dont like coming over her house?	"Couple years ago I was involved in a really bad house fire that I caused. I didn’t burned down the house or anything but severely injuring myself and my roommates girlfriend. It was my mistake and I regret it everyday. After getting discharged and going home (doctor said I needed surgery for my burns). I went to a burn clinic 3 hours away where my mom and her wife met me. (Someone else drove me). They told me I have options to go places and found out there was a burn clinic 1hr from my moms house which is about 6 hours away from my house. My mom is the best person in the entire universe and wanted to be there. So she volunteered for me to stay at her wife’s place after my surgery.

&#x200B;

I was staying at their place approximately 2-3 weeks after my surgery. I was bandaged up and on bed rest for 1 week. My mom helped with a lot and was wonderful, on the other hand her wife made me felt that I was a burden. I got really depressed staying there. I had the guilt of injury myself and someone who didn’t deserve any of this. My roommates friend also had to had surgery and her burns were more severe than mine.

&#x200B;

I felt really guilty for the entire time. Being threatened by my roommates gf parents of being sue and afraid of my roommate (one of my best friends) not being my friend anymore. I also was really close with her too. I was super down among other things. My moms wife’s house just reminds me of the lowest point I have ever been. I hate being there. It just reminds me of the pain I caused and the depression I went through. She is one of those type of retires that they do not do ANYTHING around the house. She waited for my mom to get off working 9-10 hours and my mom would cook and clean like the saint she is.  Fast forward to yesterday. Visited my mom and she asked why I don’t come over that much even though I’m 15 mins away. I simply stated that I didn’t like the house because it reminds me of a traumatic time in my life. My mom totally understood but her wife got instantly aggressive. Started arguing with me about this is her house and that was super disrespectful. She threatened to kick me out at which I just left. I always been a straight up person who doesn’t sugar coat stuff.

&#x200B;

Instead of understanding why I felt that way she made it about herself and her home. A lot of arguments she makes she turns it about herself and she’s the victim. Which is annoying. One time she had to take me to the clinic and didn’t ask if I was ok just bitched about having to drive there. Also while on bed rest with burns I ask for her to possibly make me some lunch and she threw the peanut butter jar and bread of the bed and told me she wasn’t making it. AITA for not liking her place and telling her the honest answer?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I don’t like my moms house because of a traumatic experience. Got asked why I don’t come over. Gave a honest answer which lead to an argument about her instead of how I felt."	Not the A-hole	0	0	75.0	25.0	0.0	0.0
c1c9kw	2019-06-16 17:12:21		AITA for not wanting to go to church to support my mom?	So basically, my mom is very religious (mormon), but I (16M), have slowly drifted away from believing in the church and going every Sunday makes me very uncomfortable due to most of the church’s weird past and all of the other weird stuff we learn/talk about there. My dad already doesn’t go for a lot of the same reasons as me, but pushes me to go with my mom to support her (I also have 3 younger brothers who go). My mom is also very adamant on me going and gets emotional when I push to skip. Our church is also very big on being righteous in order to be with your family in heaven, and if I stop going she views it as me falling away from that. Church is also two hours long, and for only one of that hour would I even be around my mom. Am i the asshole for not wanting to go with her?	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We live in a country with a very hot climate in the summer and don't have air conditioning so we open the windows early in the morning and late in the evening.
The thing is my room is the hottest because the sun shines on it the most. I also open the windows when I wake up and go to sleep, but it's not enough to keep my room cold. Lately my mother has been going into my room while I'm still asleep(around 6am.) and opens the windows and waking me up. 

I usually go to sleep late and wake up at 8 Or 7 and have trouble falling asleep so I always groan and complain when she wakes me up. She became angry and didn't let me have the door of my room open or she would YELL at me. This makes my room a natrual sauna and I have to study in it and work so it's very uncomftrable.

For the most part this was okay, but her and her hisband are both very busy with work and two children so occassionally the cat would get let in but not let out for a while. This lead to the cat pooping in the baby’s crib. 

My friend thinks hes doing this out of jealousy 🤷‍♀️ Either way, she texted me last week saying that she no longer wants the cat and that her SIL told her to leave him on the side of the road somewhere. I don’t know if my friend would ever have left him like that, but I also wasn’t going to find out.

The next day I went to her house to get the kitty.  While I was there she told me that her and her husband have decided to get another kitten because her MIL’s new cat had kittens. 

I haven’t talked to her since and have no plans to talk to her. I mostly feel justified in this decision, but I also feel like throwing away 23 years of friendship over a cat is an over reaction.

Growing up, he was a drunk and would often go into moods of general ""apathy"" or laziness where I pretty much had to take care of myself. Sure some other kids go through something similar, but it still sucks and it's made me resent him. 

He cleaned his act (I think) but unfortunately his memory has been completely shot now. He would repeat the same story 5 times, each time like he never told it before. On top of that he depends on me for emotional stability or someone to talk issues with. I didn't agree to this, nor do I particularly want to.

Now that I'm an adult, I don't have time nor do I want to make time to listen to him. He's been calling me and I just don't respond. A phone call that should have been 5 minutes stretches to 30 because he wants to tell me the importance of eating kimchi or letting brown rice soak in water the night before, or to listen to him yell at me because I'm taking a university class he doesn't like (when it's a general education requirement)....or et cetera...

My brother still talks to him and it sounds like he's not in a good place. I feel like talking to him will make me depressed and angry like I was as a child. I have a good life now, a busy life, but a good one, free of negativity and bad influences.


TLDR: I ignore my dad because I'm tired of him uselessly rambling and bad memories of him as a drunk.

The plan was to head out Wednesday night and come back Friday morning. Now we all worked at different times on Wednesday. I worked in the moring, 8-4 to be exact so I was up at 7am. Some were working 3-9 and others were working till 3am. So obviously we all could not head out at the same time. 

Fast forward to around 11:30. Friend A and Friend B have arrived as they only worked till 9. After we finished unpacking friend A started to play games on his computer and I started to play on mine and friend B went to sleep. 

Around 2 am I start to get tired since I've been up since 7 but I have to let the people who are arriving at 4:30am in.
 So I set an alarm for 4, 30 minutes before they arrive and tell friend A I'm going to bed. 

Friend A says you better not go to bed to which I reply I've been up since 7 and it's 2am I'm going to bed you can keep playing your game.

4:30 rolls around and we get everyone inside and all of us go to bed.

Friend B was the first to wake up so she started to make burgers for breakfast since it was noon when we woke up. We are all eating when friend A wakes up and starts complaining that we are having burgers for breakfast. Keep in mind we all brought food and drinks except for him. After more complaining we all finished breakfast and play uno for a bit. 

We head downstairs to where the computers are (it was a rainy day) and friend A and I start playing. Friend A starts complaining that the wifi sucks (it's not the best but it's definitely more than enough to play games). 

While we are playing friend B, C, and D start to take a nap because most were up very late. Nothing wrong with that right.

Friend A then starts shouting trying to wake everyone up asking why are we sleeping. 

Friend A : why are you guys sleeping c'mon wake up

Friend C: ok can I play your game?

Friend A: no 

Friend C: ok so I'm going back to bed hey joshp123000 can you turn the lights. 

Friend A: no don't turn off the lights!

Me: ok I'll turn off 2 and leave the main light in the center of the room on.

I turn them off but leave a light on for friend A, the main light in the room

Friend A: you got three seconds to turn those lights back on or I'm leaving

Me: why? I left one on for you it's really not that big of a deal. 

Friend  A starts packing and leaves and has refused to talk to me and friend B since this incident. He made a post on his Snapchat story saying don't invite me places when all your gonna do is sleep. 

After we woke up from maybe an hour nap we started to have fun and play games, we still couldn't go outside though cause it was still raining. But the rest of us had a lot of fun.

Turned off a light because people were trying to take a nap friend gets mad about it and leaves and won't to talk to me."	Not enough info	0	0	172.0	64.0	0.0	0.0
c1c3zl	2019-06-16 16:58:27		WIBTA If I returned my Father's Day gifts.	"We've been married for 7 years, together for 12. It's a second marriage for both of us. We have 5 children and 1 grandchild. Whenever anyone asks, I tell them that I want a gift that shows that they ""get"" me. And that opens a lot of doors. I have several hobbies including gardening, chicken raising, cycling, I'm learning basic woodworking, etc... Typical dad stuff, nothing crazy. It also doesn't have to be a store bought gift.   Make something or do something. Commit to spending an hour weeding ***with me*** in my garden. That would thrill me.  I would be much happier with time spent with me than money spent on me. And I have, repeatedly, made that clear.  

A little more background. I am unemployed. Have been for about 6 months and finances are getting really tight. I get unemployment, which is deposited weekly onto a debit card.  
So, yesterday, my wife asks if she can use my unemployment card. Since we don't have hers and his finances, I gave it to her without a thought, but I did have an idea why she wanted it.  

This morning, she gets up and tells me to wait so she can get things ready. I come down after about 20 minutes and there is, displayed on the table, 2 pair of khaki shorts and 2 polo shirts. I have never, unless it's a work thing, worn khaki shorts or polo shirts. They aren't even wrapped. There is a really cool Star Wars card that I like a lot, until I see that it cost $10.  That's it. No breakfast, no gathering of everyone to spend 5 minutes to wish me a Happy Father's Day. Just a stack of clothes on the dining room table with a card on top. I had a hard time expressing any enthusiasm. I did fawn over the card, which really is cool. I'll probably mount it in a shadow box (it lights up and plays music. It's pretty dope.)  

So, I am not going to wear these clothes. For 1, because they are not my style. And 2nd, because they're a reminder that my wife does not ""get"" me. The grand total for everything was around $80. $80 we don't have right now. We don't get any more money until Friday.  

So, would I be the asshole for returning my Father's Day gifts? I know it will really upset her and could result in a real argument. But honestly, I don't think we can afford something I'm not going to wear more than once."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

With Pride Month in full swing, there's been no shortage of celebration and talk around LGBT+ pride in general, where we've come from, and what we still have to do.

I was recently with a group of friends and the topic came up. I told them that I personally wasn't necessarily *proud* of being gay, since it was just something I was born as. I'm as proud of being gay as I am proud to have dark hair or proud to be Thai. My contention is this: being gay is something I was born as and something that I had no real control over. I feel good being gay, but it's not an accomplishment. Where some people are persecuted, shamed, intimidated into the closet, or worse yet harmed because of their sexuality, I live in a place where I actually receive great privilege for being gay. I've received gifts, job opportunities, networking opportunities, friendships, free or discounted services, even generosity on behalf of the local police because I'm gay. I once got out of a traffic ticket because the cop recognized me from a Pride event. I'll go to marches, volunteer, all that, but where I live, people would probably be more hostile to you if you were a white guy with a southern accent.

That being said, I absolutely understand the significance of Pride Month, and I understand that others don't have it so easy. I understand that those who have been historically persecuted and now have the privilege to be safe and comfortable with who they are should stand tall for those who can't. I understand that Pride (capital P) is not about *my pride*, and that there's so much work still to be done. I get that, and I told them that.

Reactions among my friends were varied: some were understanding and a few actually agreed. Others, though, acted like I'd just asked to see Barack Obama's birth certificate. One friend went so far as to say that my attitude puts her at risk for being killed where we live. She and I had gone to a smoothie shop down the street (where queer youth get a 15% discount) YESTERDAY and saw two men walking on the sidewalk in rainbow thongs holding hands. Like, actually.

c1c0xp	2019-06-16 16:50:54	trowwwwwawayyyy	WIBTA for refusing to go for a festival together with disabled acquaintance	Throwaway account, but hear me out. I (29F) am pretty much into punk rock - I love the music and going to all those festivals and concerts. Nearly every time I go together with my daughter,  my husband and my brother. Yesterday it was somewhat different because we went without our daughter because she prefered to go to a kiddie party with her grandmother. Anyways, we went for this concert and met an acquaintance of mine (I hope this is the right word for that, at least google says it's should convey that she's not-yet-a-friend-but-we-somewhat-know-each-other). The acquaintance is a disabled woman who rides in a wheelchair (she has cerebral palsy) and it looks like she searches for friends quite desperately. I talked to her for a while, helped her with getting something to drink and a straw to let her drink without spilling etc. You know, some pretty casual stuff, at least in my mind. When it started to rain I offered to give her a ride home. It was a tight fit with the wheelchair in but we managed - mostly because our daughter wasn't there and so there was some extra space for putting disassembled parts of the wheelchair on a backseat. We dropped her off at her home and her father helped her get in. I thought that's pretty much everything but then she writes to me on social media saying that she looks forward to going to a concert with us again. And she writtes it in such a way as it was already some obvious thing that she goes with us. I was bewildered because I am not sure if we could fit her wheelchair in if our daughter goes with us. And I am not going to leave the kid out because some woman invited herself for a ride. I told her that if there is next time when we will have extra space because the daughter isn't going with us (for whatever reason) we can pick her up. She told me she has a lot of experience in packing things up and it's not going to be a problem. It weirded me out because I get it that her disability makes things really hard for her and she wants to have new friends but I don't think I have given any indication that next trip together would be a given - and she acts like it is. Her clinginess pretty much scares me because I don't think I WANT to be friends with her. I have a few friends with mental and psychical disabilities so that part isn't an issue but I don't like her personality very much and the fact that yesterday she seemed to expect me to stay by her side most of the time/all the time. Given, I don't think it was because she expected me to take care of her (at least not much) but to talk and keep her company, but it still was hard for me. I pretty much wanted to go for a mosh pit and didn't enjoy her company but leaving her alone seemed petty so I endured (but wasn't too happy about it). It probably sounds extremely whiney but hell...

I thought some seconds and I said, ""I'm sorry, but I have to say no. I think that this is dishonest."" The guy, instead of getting mad or something, he just says ""O.K."" but like in a mood of dissappointed.

My parents are divorced and I live with both of them and go to each house almost every day. Ever since my father remarried, he has become very religious and so is my step-mother. Over the years I have strayed farther away from my previous Christian faith and adopted my own personal spiritual beliefs. Because of this, I do not go to church and have had this conversation with both of my sets of parents. 
 I work full-time (I'm a university student) during the summer and usually work Sunday mornings because my assistant manager is religious and likes having Sundays off. This Sunday I did not have work because we switched some shifts around. 
I followed my usual morning routine and was heading to get breakfast when I was asked if I would be joining my family for church today. I said ""probably not"" and a few minutes later I was confronted by one of my parents for ""playing games"" and never wanting to go to church, even though I have made it clear that I do not/will not go. The tone and the way I was spoken to was extremely rude and I told them that we could talk when they get back from church. Five minutes later, my father told me that I should have expected to go on father's day because it is an important day and that I don't act like I love him. I told him that I did not appreciate the way that I was talked to previously, and if I was asked to go/told it was important to go on father's day I would have gone without a problem. I then got ready and went with them to church.
My issue with this is that my parents lack communication with me. They constantly forget to tell me about events and then get confused and frustrated when I am not ready to go to them. I hate going to church, but I love my dad and I would have gone if he would have talked to me or even texted me and asked me to go with him. It was the fact that it was somehow expected without any prior acknowledgement that made me upset about this situation. 
I can see from my parents perspective that church is something important to them and that they would want to share that with me on father's day. Because of this, I have felt horrible for making my parents feel bad and my dad's comment about me not making him feel like I love him. But from my point of view, I don't understand why I would be expected to go practice a religion I am not a part of."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I have tried to say to them that it's 2019 and not 1980 anymore but it never gets the point across to them.

This past month I have been swarmed with GCSE's , revision and on top of that trying to sort out an apprenticeship. I have been very stressed and have 2 exams left, which I will be doing tomorrow. I was invited to my friends house on Friday and I thought I deserved a break so I went. I told my mum I'll be their all week and that I will sort out my c.v. on sunday with her.

Today (sunday) I cam back home and asked if we could look over the c.v I have already made and check for any mistakes. However, When I asked I was told it was too late and that I should of came home earlier. It was 4:30. She reluctantly said she would help me but began calling me names. So I said I would do it myself, which made her angrier. As I walked up the stairs to my bedroom I could hear her shouting at me to come downstairs. I ignored her and went up to my room to begin working on my c.v.

A couple of minutes go by and my sister walks into my room telling me that my mum wants me. I walk downstairs (expecting an apology)and don't say a word to her. Instead of telling me what I did wrong on my c.v. She just wrote a new one.

I have read through the c.v. She has wrote for me and it contains lots of lies in order to make me seem better. At this point I had enough. So I got mad and said that she was being disrespectful to me earlier and that she shouldn't lie on my c.v."	Not the A-hole	0	0	32.0	20.0	0.0	0.0

Very quickly I began to learn about some of her not so pleasant habits. She is a hoarder. Every empty space possible has to be piled high with stuff, including trash. She loves to keep cardboard boxes from all the things she orders online and claims she can't throw them away because the cats will miss their ""new toys"". Aside from semi regularly washing dishes, she doesn't clean. No sweeping, vacuum, dusting, nothing. Shes a baker and sometimes does custom cakes on the side and leaves the kitchen a wreck for me to clean. This is made worse by the fact that she is a slob that leaves crumbs everywhere she goes.  I rarely invite guests over because I'm constantly embarrassed by the state of our house. No matter how much I try to clean up after her, she makes a mess faster than I can keep up. 

Every time I confront her about her cleanliness issues shes throws it back at me by trying to mention every time I may have left behind a mess somewhere. Sure, I'm not the cleanest person in the world but who is? Her father bought her a tall five shelf storage unit and unfortunately, the only place it fit was the last clear area we had in the living room. Being at it's in a communal area, one would think it would be for shared storage, but no. Didn't ask if I wanted even half of a shelf for myself. It's now an eyesore literally overflowing with junk she mostly doesn't use. 

The worst part for me though is how inconsiderate and insensitive she is. She has no social life so her evenings and days off are spent on the couch hogging the tv and doing absolutely nothing. She sits so often she wore out the springs on her side of the couch and now uses my side.  I have severe anxiety and depression so I have panic attacks quite frequently. I had a really bad panic attack after work one day and spent at least half an hour pacing the living room crying my eyes out like a baby. She didn't once ask if I was ok and the minute I managed to calm down she launched into a conversation about her day before I could even catch my breath. This brings me back to my original point. I'm done trying to change her, either I have to go or she does. I usually plan out how I want to confront her in my head but due to high anxiety I tend to chicken out by the time I get home. This is obviously a conversation that is best fully discussed in person, which I plan on doing, the hard part is actually starting the conversation.

c1bvgo	2019-06-16 16:36:52	bblonded-nya	AITA for telling my friend I’d rather she didn’t attend my extra classes after school?	"Just to simplify things, I’ll refer to said friend as Karen and my two teachers as teacher A and teacher B. 

I do extra french speaking classes after school with teacher B. Last week I had my last session with her before I have my exams; I could only stay for half of the session because I had somewhere urgent to be, and so I just wanted to do some prep for said exam. Karen told me that she wanted to come to my speaking class (only around three people attend) because she had ‘time to kill’. Karen doesn’t take french, so there was no need for her to attend. She’s also fluent in french and made some joke before the lesson started about how she only wanted to come to mock my accent. She’s fairly close with teacher A, so when I told her my class was with teacher B (a teacher which Karen has never spoken to) she said something along the lines of ‘oh, I don’t care about teacher B, she’s irrelevant.’ Teacher B was late to the lesson and since I was missing half the session, I wanted to get as much done as possible. Karen then proceeds to spend the entire session telling stories about herself- whenever teacher B would bring up a topic I wanted to revise Karen would go on a huge tangent that didn’t relate to anything and was constantly saying ‘oh you know I speak french right?’ Teacher B didn’t seem too bothered, but asked her to perhaps tell a story in french, to which Karen replied ‘uh, how about no,’ and continued to talk about herself. Because of this, I didn’t really get anything that I needed to get done done. 

The next morning, Karen came up to me and started gushing about how much she loved teacher B now after that session and I made some mindless joke about how she said earlier she didn’t care about teacher B. Karen laughed it off and said something like ‘no, now I don’t care about teacher A!’ I then told her that I’d rather she didn’t come to any of my french classes again because I didn’t get any work done since she was constantly talking about herself. I’ll admit that I didn’t say it in the most polite way (I sort of mocked the way that she speaks since she was speaking so much)but Karen just said  ‘ok then!!’ and stormed off. I had a class with Karen that morning where she sits next to me, and the whole lesson (we were supposed to be doing group work in pairs together) she didn’t speak to me. She often gets mad at me for petty things and doesn’t talk to me, but she posted something on a private account/story which said:

‘do people now know when they have done something wrong? then they be acting like I have a problem- your attitude is so shit right now, fix that before having a go at me for being bitchy! this is not aimed by the way!’

She knew I was going to see what she wrote, and she knew that I would know it was about me. A few friends of mine said that Karen told them that ‘something went down between us.’ Was it petty of me to tell her not to attend my classes? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

She asked me what I wanted, but I hadn’t even been given a menu yet. I ordered coffee and water. She gave it to me and dashed off. I had to ask another table for cream. 8 minutes or so passed, and she never came back for my order. I had taken a few sips of my coffee, but I was thinking, “wow, I’ve been here for 30 minutes and haven’t ordered yet.” I felt like she was never coming back, and I’d never get my food. I’d been there so long that the Mexican place down the street was now open. I was so hungry and realized I’d get served more quickly if I just left and went there. So I did. I felt so disrespected and awkward. People who were waiting for a table were right there looking at me, and it just became so awkward. I didn’t pay for the coffee and just walked out the door. Had a wonderful breakfast at the Mexican place. So AITA for not paying for the coffee? In my defense, it would have taken forever to get the check, and I was so done with that place.

c1bujs	2019-06-16 16:34:42	GarethOrme	AITA for potentially refusing to work with my dad this summer?	"For some background, My dad and I have had a strained relationship ever since my parents divorced in 2015. I'm 20 now, and the majority of the strain comes from his refusal to accept that I wish to do something different than manual labor and would prefer to go into a field with a college degree rather than a trade.

In 2003, when I was 4 years old, My dad built a treehouse in our backyard. It's honestly an incredible treehouse and a true testament to his craftsmanship, with it being featured in an issue of Popular Mechanics in 2006. However, the years have taken a toll on this treehouse and a fork has been reached in the road: either repair it or tear it down. I would personally love to help out here and there with the project of repairing it but I also have a full-time job (\~8 hours a day) and really don't want the last thing I do after work would be up to three hours of manual labor. I would be willing to help out for like an hour every now and then, but I don't think I would be able to commit to the project fully.

I know this doesn't sound like a big deal, but the problem becomes more apparent if you have some insight into my father. Ever since I was a small child, He always had problems with anger and emotional abuse, which only became more intense after my mom left him. There is no doubt in my mind that he would constantly shame me and call me a wimp for not wanting to fully commit myself to a physical labor project, even with my full-time job. He has always said that my brother and I aren't ""true men"", mainly because we don't share a whole lot of his interests/views. This also has the potential to put strain on my mother due to the fact that I'd like to see her every now and then (My father already gets an unfair amount of time with his children due to my job being in his area rather than my moms, 5 out of 7 days) and I can maybe think that he could be using this as a ploy to try and keep my brother and me from seeing our mother on the weekends.

Am I the Asshole for possibly refusing to fully commit to this because of time constraints and the stress it could put on me to be unable to relax after work, along with the potential of this being a ploy to shame my brother and I and to take us away from our mother? My brother doesn't have a job and neither does my dad (he lives off of my mom's alimony), and I don't think he would even necessarily need me to help him all the time because of that, it's not like he has anything to do during the day. But on the other hand, I may be overreacting and should just suck it up and help him, right? Many other people work much more than me and I kind of feel like I'm being a brat for not necessarily wanting to throw myself fully into this project.

Maybe a year ago now I was on a road trip. I pulled off to take a piss, fuel up, and eat something. My partner goes to the restroom first and I pay cash to fill the van. $20. One cold Jackson. I dont remember why I paid cash. I had enough in the bank to pay with card, but that's what I did. Anyways, I go out to the van and pump the gas. I didn't jerk on the machine or try to game it. I just pulled the trigger and locked it in place. Ideally when the $20 are spent it automatically unlocks and stops filling. But, when the pump stops I see that its actually put in $20.01 worth of gas. I see this but only think that it's interesting. I dont feel an obligation to hurry and find a penny and rush it in. Anyways I go in to take that piss. My partner comes out and I go in. When I come out she tells me what had just happened. Something along the lines of... Register 'Miss, is that van yours?' 
Partner: 'Yes'
'You need to pay the difference'
'What difference?'
'The extra cent of gas you got out of the machine'
'Oh uh, ok. Let me go out and find a penny quick'
Some guy in line : 'I think I have a penny here on me'
Register: 'You know what, never mind I think I have one'
Partner: 'Oh ok'.

There was more to it than that, but that's about the jist of it.

Anyways, whenever we pass by that gas station on subsequent trips, my partner and I laugh and make fun of the experience and the lady at the registers expense.

"My Dad is a very conservative man who believes the husband should be the head of the household who ""wakes up on Sundays and makes his family go to church"". My husband and I have visited many churches in our area but haven't yet found one we both really like. My husband also has two kids from a previous marriage that live 4.5 hours away. When they visit, Sunday is our day to drive them back home so we don't go to church on those Sundays. My Dad has never been in my home on a Sunday morning so he has no idea what sort of conversations my husband and I have had about church. From his point of view, he thinks my husband isn't a ""man of God"" because he doesn't make us get up and go to church every week. Ironically, Dad gets up and goes to church without my Mom every single week. I only know he feels this way because my Mom told me. She also told me some other things my Dad said about my husband that really bothered both of us. Things about the type of father he is, the type of husband he is, and just all around attacks on his character. To his face though my Dad says nothing but how much he loves my husband and how great of a man he is and how I'm so lucky to have him. He's basically a huge hypocrite and I'm just now realizing he is like this.

This all came out a month ago and he has yet to apologize. My Mom also tells me that in the 34 years they've been married, he has never been the first one to apologize for anything. I guess he has such a fragile sense of self that apologizing is a huge blow to his ego.

I just can't move on and be okay with him without an apology for the hurtful things he said about my husband. It's not okay with me to hurt the people I love and I don't want to be around someone who can't just say ""I'm sorry"" when they've hurt someone. I've seen him many times in the past month and he continues to pretend like nothing happened. He acts like everything is great and then gets mad at me when I'm ""cold"" or ""distant"".

My Mom blamed me for the fact that she told me everything my Dad said. She literally blamed me for her being a blabbermouth. Between the two of them, I've never seen two people more incapable of owning up to their actions. It's getting to the point where I don't even like being around my parents anymore. I have a four week old baby and I don't want to keep their grandchild from them but I can barely stand to be in their company. My husband doesn't want to be around them either and I don't blame him. I'm supposed to visit this afternoon to bring my Dad a Father's Day gift and my heart just isn't in it. I feel like a giant pile of human garbage for not wanting to be around my own parents.

c1bryc	2019-06-16 16:28:13	aroaceintrovert	AITA for not going to a friend’s grad party because I had plans with another friend?	"My friends A and B were both medical students in different colleges. They had their final exams last month. The results came out last week and they passed.

Now friend A had her result first. She was really happy and wanted to throw a grad party with her friends before she left the city to go back home, but everyone was busy with jobs or life in general, and she felt really down about it. So on Monday, she asked me if she could hang out with me on Sunday to celebrate. I said of course! I wanted to cheer her up so I also invited an old email buddy of hers to my place to surprise her. We had the day planned for a chill hangout and some casual fun. Now friend A knows I have multiple plans popping up all the time so she made me promise not to ditch her on this one.

Friend B then has his result come out two days later. On Thursday, he plans a grad party with all  his friends. He asked us if Saturday or Sunday worked out for us. I explained that I had plans on Sunday, so Saturday worked best. But I was the only one who couldn’t make it on Sunday so I told him to go ahead with Sunday since it works out for everyone else.

Now friend B and I go back 8 years, we’re very close. Friend A and I go back 6 years, and we’re also very close. I don’t like to compare my friends to say who’s more important than the other. I value them all, and try my best to make it work with everyone. Friend B found out that I had plans with friend A, and I could tell he was slightly offended that I couldn’t make it to his party because I was having a simple hangout with Friend A. He kept asking me multiple times to come over even if it’s for an hour. I said I’d definitely try but it would be difficult since I already had a commitment and I couldn’t back out of it. Friend A always gets pushed back by friends because people would ditch plans with her for other priorities, so I wanted to give A the time and happiness she deserved.

Anyways, today the hangout went great. We spent time from 9am to 8pm together, the surprise went perfectly. It was a day well spent. Now at this point it’s 8pm. Friend B’s grad party started at 6pm and ended around 9-10. I could have Ubered to his place, stayed for maybe an hour and then come back home. But at this point I was tired, fatigued and was running on 28 hours of no sleep (insomnia). So I called friend B and all the other friends and told them that it was getting late and I just didn’t think I could make it. They said that there was still time, but I apologized profusely and said that I couldn’t come.

I’m feeling guilty and there’s also this FOMO thing happening. I honestly would have loved to have been there, genuinely felt conflicted about not going. Just some INFO, I don’t usually ditch plans ever unless I’ve got other previous commitments or there is some emergency. I just don’t think friend B considers my commitment with friend A to be important enough to not come to his party. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0	433.0	24.0	0.0	0.0

"This happened in December but I just found out about it.  Today I am taking my kids to see their grandfather and I am planning on confronting my ex MIL.  So, as title states, my daughter (15) attended the party and there is a $15 secret Santa gift exchange.  My daughter and I went to an upscale store and she purchased (with her own money I might add) a beautiful ceramic Christmas tree, some Christmas tree shaped bath bombs (both items cost approximately $17 together and we still have the receipt) and she included a small painting she made to boot.  She’s no artist but, I thought the concept was adorable - it was a mini canvas with a magnet to hang on the fridge, she painted a small Christmas themed painting.  

Anyway, my daughter tells me the other day, after being frustrated with my ex MIL for not inviting her and her brother to a family picnic, that my ex MIL confronted her about the gift she gave at the party and accused my daughter of regifting/recycling the gift.  Mind you, my ex husband (father of kids and son of ex in-laws) is a dead beat, drunk/drug addicted loser who owes me $50K in child support.  

Over the years my ex MIL has said and done some shady shit and I have been suppressing my inner desire to scream at her for the last 10 years.  Example: the last time I saw her I told her we were going to stop and check out the new goodwill near their house and she says to me, “Oh, I love the goodwill but I’d never be able to wear someone else’s clothes - that’s so gross!  Aren’t you afraid of bugs and germs?”.  I wanted to leap across the room and choke her but, I didn’t.  Instead I just sat there calmly and just smiled at her.  I am a struggling, single mom, they know this.  They also know their loser son doesn’t pay any child support nor has he bothered with calling/seeing them for several years now.

So I’m turning 20 next month, but before anyone says happy birthday I want to note that I hate being the center of attention. Y’know, big anxiety and all that Jazz, I love being alone. I always ask my parents not to do anything for me, preferring to hide away. For example, this past Christmas after church (I get paid for being a choir boy) it was about 1 pm when I got home, and I tried my damndest to slip in my room and go to bed. To be fair, there was a midnight mass the previous night, but still they brought me out. 

Now, if you guys have seen “The Goldbergs,” think of Beverly, the mother, or self-proclaimed “smother,” that wants to do everything for her kids. That’s my mom to a tee, and I hate it. I always put up with whatever she tries to do because it makes her happy, but also because I had no other choice.

This year is my first birthday where I have a car and a drivers license, so what I wanted to do is spend the ENTIRE day out of the house. I’d see Spider-man Far From Home, have some lunch, and generally just hide from my family. I’d want to do this as long as possible, so the next day (being a Sunday) I’d go to church and attend the church festival afterwards, not coming home until late yet again.

Problem: this would definitely break my parents’ hearts, and I’m already on not too good terms with them. AITA for wanting to disappear for the weekend and denying them of a celebration?

My relationship with my parents is really rocky and can become really tense and manipulative, so planning to see then is really stressful for me. My best friend offered to come with me to ease the tension for the two nights we would be there.

My friend expressed that she might not be able to do a week day but the weekend would be fine. We discussed this over a month ago and she's been completely on board every single time I bring it up (pretty often because I want to make sure things will still work). 

This morning I get off the phone with my parents and try to confirm with friend that next weekend will still work and she hits me with ""well I don't want to stay two nights"" and ""the thing is my July is busy every weekend and I'll be pretty busy with work during the week"".

She even brought up that it would be ""bad vibes"" which I find kind of frustrating since she's known that my relationship with my parents isn't great and she literally referred to herself as a buffer between us for the weekend.

I'm honestly pretty upset about this. She knows how hard it is for me to be alone with them and she told me weeks and weeks ago she'll come with me (especially since my long-term boyfriend and I broke up and he'd usually be the one to come with) as long as we can do it on a weekend. It feels like she's just last minute coming up with excuses and I feel hurt that she would do this. All the issues she's brought up she's known about for multiple weeks and I've brought the trip up to her many times and she's never expressed any type of problems with it until now, basically a week before we would go. 

AITA for being upset about this? We've been friends for so long and while yes she would be a buffer, I also really wanted her to come because she loves hiking and being outside and their house is in a mini heaven."	Not enough info	0	0	34.0	4.0	0.0	0.0

And now to today: I’m 16 now and i haven’t seen or spoken to my dad since december. In all honesty, i haven’t reached out to him, but he was quite abusive and its probably better for me to... not contact him myself. But he also hasn’t tried to contact me.

c1bolw	2019-06-16 16:20:01		AITA for getting mad at my mom because of her Father's Day plans?	"My dad and I have never gotten along. He's been a drug addict my entire life and has also been emotionally abusive to my mom and me (as well as occasionally physically abusive to me). After moving away for college, I started seeing a therapist because of the issues growing up with my dad has caused. The therapist explained to me that I am the scapegoat child, while my sister is the golden child to our father. Neither of us care for him at all and wish to never see him again.

&#x200B;

My dad became disabled in an accident a few years back and it has been tough since then. My mom quit her job to take care of him and it took an extreme toll on her mentally and physically. About a year ago, his disability had progressed to the point where she could no longer take care of him and he was moved to a care facility. Before the care facility, my relationship with my mom was strained because all she seemed to care about was taking care of this awful man. Now, she goes and visits him mostly everyday, sometimes every other day, and our relationship has improved even past the point of where we were before. I have not talked to my dad in six months as I never go to see him. Sometimes my mom attempts to trick me into going there, saying she wants to go shopping so I'll get in the car with her. My mom was abused by this man for over 20 years and abused my her parents her entire life before that, so I understand why she is how she is, but it can be frustrating.

&#x200B;

My current problem is that it's Father's Day and my mom has decided to make a big deal of it. She bought my dad gifts (he has never bought her anything in their 20+ years of marriage), printed out a bunch of pictures of our family and also brought cards from each of us. She signed our names in them, too, without asking us because she knew we wouldn't want to give our dad anything. My sister is on vacation at the moment and so can't go see him and I absolutely refuse to visit or call him (I actually have his number blocked because he would text me hateful things). My mom got all dressed up and took the gifts that are supposedly from his children. She told him that I'm sick but that I miss him and wish him a very happy day and that I love him--all lies. When she told me she did this, I got upset and told her I felt disrespected. Now there's a lot of tension in the house and she's clearly upset with me for being upset with her and vice versa.

c1bnc7	2019-06-16 16:16:41	Tutsks	AITA for giving 0 stars to my Uber driver?	"So, I had a ton of recycling to get to the depot. Was gonna take the bus, but it was 6 huge bags total, and it seemed... a poor choice.

So, I figured I'd just ping an Uber, the trip is supposed to cost around 8 dollars.

When the guy got here, he had a quite nice Ranger with a sliding door. I moved to put my stuff in, but he said to put it in the back, and pushed the bags in, breaking one, and taking a bunch of time. We got going, he clearly didn't know how to get to the place and neither was he checking his GPS, and at some point he asked me if a detour was fine.

Anyway, we finally got to the place, he was adamant on where to park and on turning his van around, and he finally let me go.

I am glad I had brought extra bags because the one he broke spilled bottles and cans everywhere.

So, I tipped him .01 cent in the app, and told Uber that he had ripped the bags, wasted a bunch of my time, and the fare had been 10 and not 8 as the app had said. And, left him a 0 star review (or whatever is the minimum).

Some background:

I switched the bags the recycling was in, they were all clean, new, whatever size the huge black garbage cans are. They were not dirty or dusty or sticky, and I rinse the cans/bottles.

He had almost full stars before our trip. So I assume other people's mileage might be different.

So, AITA for leaving a 0 star review and telling Uber about this? Was what he did at all wrong?

Been bugging me, so I figure I'd ask you guys.

Edit: 

Some more context since some people say I was hauling garbage, or it was loosely secured: In the city where I live atm there is a deposit for bottles and cans that you get back when you return the recyclables. This wasn't garbage, it was just aluminum cans, and glass bottles, rinsed.

And to make things clear, when he ripped the bag it didn't make a mess in his trunk. The mess was on the floor after I got off.

Edit 2: 

This has been very insightful as to how people read into things stuff that isn't really there. No, the stuff was not heavy, it was not messy, it was bulky, but not loosely or badly packed, and he was the one that punctured the bag by squeezing it too hard. 

Thaaaaat said, I have considered what people have said about this not really being a service for this sort of thing and... you know what, you have a point. I am most definitely TA in this situation and shouldn't have been so harsh when the situation was probably inconvenient all around. Also, just because my cans and bags were clean, it doesn't mean everyone's are, and I understand him not risking it with his car.

Thanks for the feedback, I truly hadn't considered a few of the stuff you guys said. Cheers."	Asshole	0	0	3733.0	217.0	0.0	0.0

She is currently studying for her boards. She made mention that Ultrasound (US) unlike CT or MRI is very technician dependent. A US technician can make a normal image look abnormal. So I was shocked at this but I know many things in medicine are chaotic and messy. There are more grey parts than purely black or white. I’m a nurse practitioner for 5 years and a RN for 12. So I asked her what regulatory safety net does her profession or hospital do to prevent or catch these US technicians who are clearly not representing the images right. Her husband who was listening said “well how many bad nurses are there?!” I didn’t mean to attack her profession and I tried to explain that. But they kept on citing examples of nurses like the one in Canada was practicing without a license for 20 years.

I currently live abroad and have not been been involved in any of her wedding planning whatsoever. I am generally not a fan of weddings, but she has done absolutely nothing wrong here - this isn't a bridezilla situation. 

Now here's the thing: Her wedding is the day after my last day of work in my job abroad. I have to move back to my home country in the two months after my job here ends, but her wedding makes it so I have to move literally the day after my job here ends. I have built an incredible life here, I have super close friends, colleagues, and a partner. On top of it all, I work impossibly long hours and I never get to spend the time with them that I want and need. If I didn't go to her wedding, I could finally have some quiet time here and not leave in a rush and as an emotional mess. It would be such a whirlwind!

Unfortunaltely, I told her months ago I would come. Also unfortunaltely, while I love her dearly, I don't think she would understand my reasoning and she would be incredibly upset with me. So I feel like if I want to get out of this I would have to come up with a lie - which I don't really want to do. I am moving back near to where she lives soon and am hoping to have her in my life as a good friend for years to come. As for the wedding itself: I don't mind going, but I would go solely for her, as I personally really struggle with weddings in general.

c1biiw	2019-06-16 16:04:42	privaterachel	WIBTA for having dinner with friends at my parents house, and not include my parents	"I currently live with my parents. Here it is normal for generations to live in one roof. One night, I invited my friends over to have dinner. I told my parents about this event a few days before, and they asked what they would be eating.

I realized my parents meant to include themselves. Having not lived with them for some time, it slipped my mind. I had previously lived with another relative who gave us a lot of privacy and vice versa me to them when it came to parties.

The reason I don't like it is that my father is a conversation hog. However a friend convinced me it would be fine and fun so we push through.

Come that night, we have dinner, and he talks and talks and talks. My friends, my mother, and I can barely get a few sentences in, usually to agree or acknowledge what he said, then he goes to another story of him or his friends. This goes on for 4 hours. It was like a 4 hour monologue.

In between, I try to get out by using the bathroom and at one point, saying I will clean the table (it was approaching midnight), which prompts my friends to say they will help, so we can get out. We move to the kitchen and finally I can ask them how theyre doing, etc. But maybe 2 minutes later, my father follows us and he starts monopolizing the conversation again. Soon after we called it a night. 

The thing is, it is his house, so naturally my parents will always be there. But I had invited my friends over because I want to hear from THEM, not my father.

He tells me to invite them again. Would I be the asshole for requesting we eat separately next time? Or should I just forget it and eat elsewhere?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1bhts	2019-06-16 16:03:03	holloman54	AITA for not waning to be friends with someone because of her symptoms of BPD?	"I met this girl at work, she seems really cool so we started hanging out some. She said she was new to the area and looking for friends so I brought her around some of my friends and it was fine. Until one day she got angry at a friend of mine for something that was really weird, and then she freaked out on that friend, freaked out on me calling/texting me blowing my phone up. She was texting crazy stuff and left me crazy voicemails, she absolutely *lost her mind.* I just completely ignored it and so did my friend. Planned on never hanging out with her again after that.

The next day she sends me this looooong message about how she as BPD and can’t control her emotions sometimes, how she just moved here because she left a treatment center, and she sends me this link about “how to be a friend to someone with BPD” which included a lot of “tips” that basically outlined how high maintenance it would be to remain “friends” with this person. I didn’t respond.

I saw her at work on Friday and she comes up to me and asks if I got her messages, I was like uhh yeah and sorta just walked away.

This morning I woke up to another loooong message about how much of a bad person I am for “ditching” her because of her mental illness. That it’s not her fault she was born with a disease and she’s doing her best to control her symptoms and I’m so mean for not caring.

I feel like, I’m not responsible for dealing with someone acting bat shit crazy because of a diagnosis. Why would it make me a bad person to not want to continue a relationship that is certain to be very emotionally taxing? We’re adults. I’m in charge of my actions just like she’s in charge of hers. I won’t be flipping out on her, but I’m supposed to what? Study how to handle it? No thanks? I’ll just be friends with people who can be good friends back to me.

Friend of mine for about 14 years. Generally an OK guy, but some of the shit that he's told me is seriously fucked up and makes me question if he's right for this girl. Borderline bipolar, chronic liar, manipulative, disrespectful, egotistical etc. Just a few ways I would describe his character.

I've been having to talk to this girl in secret, trying to convince her that he isn't who he appears. He is very good at putting on a show just to get ahead in life, and I don't trust him with her. 

Him and I already aren't on the best of terms at the moment due to an incident that happened about two weeks ago. It stemmed off of something that ties her into this situation. 
He's already lied to her and downplayed the whole situation to her saying that we're still friends and all is well, when in reality that couldn't be farther from the truth. To the point to he told me that he doesn't respect me because he thinks that I haven't done anything to deserve it. So that was pretty fucked up to hear. 

The thing that really pissed me off that he did was tell me that she has been sending him explicit pictures and videos. 

First off, it hit me like a freight train hearing him tell me that. And he did not hesitate to give detail. It felt like my heart turned into a vaccum and was just sucking all the life out of me. 

But anyway, what really pissed me off about it wasn't the detail or anything like that. It was the fact that he told me in the first place. Like, it is never okay to just casually give a very detailed testimony of someone's nudes to ANYONE without the other party's consent. 

It sounds fucked up, I know, but if he really wanted to be that detailed about them, he should have just fucking sent them to me at that point. (I'm probably just talking out of rage here) 

I get that it is known that guys will tell their friends about their sex lives and such but I'm just not one of those people. I don't want to know that shit. Especially if it's someone who I was interested in.

Apologies for the rambling, this has just been racing through my mind the past couple weeks and I can't really figure out if my attempts are warranted or if I'm just lying to myself and using it as an excuse to get revenge on him."	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1bfyb	2019-06-16 15:58:29		AITA for not wanting to go to family get-togethers?	"Over the past year, since I got my first taste of freedom at college, I've started to REALLY not want to go to family get-togethers (as opposed to the regular not wanting to see certain annoying family members).

The main reason I don't want to go to these events is because of the huge differences between me and my extended family. I am pretty much the only ""introvert"" of the family, and am probably the only one with social anxiety. I try my best to talk to them, but whenever I look into their eyes as we talk I can't help but feel like they're only doing it to be nice, and don't actually care.

They ask me if I'm dating anyone, and I say no. I can see the disappointment in their face, as I'm pretty much the only ""single"" cousin (my age or older anyways), who has always been single (It doesn't help that 3 of my cousins got engaged and are going to be married within the next 3 months...)

They also ask me how school is going, which I'm usually fine with answering. When I declared my major as film, Ive begun to feel like they don't support that decision. Every single one of my cousins has gone to school to either become an Accountant, Engineer, or something in the medical field (Nurse, Pharmacist, etc.), all careers I'm not interested in, since math isn't really my forté.

 At family Christmas my aunt asked me if I had switched majors yet, and I sort of laughed it off. I then noticed she wasn't laughing. She had pretty much just asked if I had ""come to my senses"" and got a job that actually has promise of making a good living. This was followed up by other family members asking how much people in film make, and how competitive everything is. It's like they're trying to convince me not to do what I love. When I talked about my short film I wrote and directed, they seem disinterested and didn't even ask to see it.

I'm not even going to get started on my grandpa, who is old and grumpy (like most I'm guessing), but constantly just surprises me with what his filter-less mouth will put out. I've had trouble finding a job, and every time I see him I am asked if I have a job yet, to which he ALWAYS replies saying how all my other cousins have a job."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My partner moved to Canada from an African country in order to live his life as a gay man free from persecution. We have a good life here but unfortunately there are things relating to his culture and family that I obviously cannot help with. 

He misses his family terribly. He hasn’t been back home in seven years and hasn’t seen any of his family since then. 

His brother back home is getting married next fall and has invited Timal to the wedding. He told me that he is planning on going to the wedding. 

I told him that while I understand that he misses his home and family, I’m afraid for his safety if he were to go back home and I really don’t want him to go back home. 

He got kind of upset with me and said that both his brother and mom know he’s gay and will protect him and that he grew up there and knows how to navigate the place and keep a low profile. 

I said that while that may have been true, he hasn’t been home in years and he might slip up and say or do something that might get him in trouble and the rest of his family doesn’t know that he is gay. 

He accused me of not trusting him and wanting to keep him from his family. I tried to explain that I’m only asking him not to go because I love him and I’m worried for his safety.

Now that I’m about to get my second paycheck my mother is demanding that I pay roughly 400 a month in rent, which sounds pretty cheap but a decent apartment where I live is anywhere from 500-600. So, AITA for telling her that I can’t pay her anything for a little bit so I can get my bills caught up and start fixing my credit score?	Asshole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1b6b5	2019-06-16 15:34:01	KirminKlump	WIBTA if I kicked my (14) F cousin off of my PSN chat?	"So background I have a PlayStation chat with a few friends who are all in their early to mid 20’s. Me being 23 they have been online friends for close to 2 years. A few months ago my cousin, mentioned in the title started playing online and would usually blow up my notifications to join her party to play a game. This usually would result in me leaving the party chat with my online friends and going to her. I would feel obligated to spend at least a couple of games playing with her and then leaving. Eventually my friends decided instead of me leaving they would start playing with both of us so we could avoid splitting up. Things started off fine for a couple of weeks but then my friend who created the party decided to just invite her to the chat out of the blue when we were playing. I explained to him this is going to be a problem but he said she’ll be fine.Now we come to the problem, she is in the least mean way possible intolerable to be around as to be expected from an immature teenager. She post a lot of memes that no one gets and talks about YouTube stars regularly as if we know what she’s talking about. which is fine no problem. The bigger problem is she constantly states we have no friends that we are online and have no real life friends which is ironic cause no one plays with her online besides us and she never goes out with her friends. She started making fun of one of my friends and constantly berates him on his weight and life when she herself knows nothing about him and what he went through. Also she’s on the hefty side and eats terribly so I mean she has no right to be saying anything and I know nutrition isn’t exactly important at that age but I digress. My friend has voiced his opinion about her verbal attacks on him and so has the other girl in our chat and she still persist on picking on him. The actual voice chat is basically her talking about irrelevant information that has nothing to do with what we’re talking about and she just tries to make jokes when we’re speaking seriously about something. She also says and post things about hanging herself killing herself being fat simply out of self depreciating humor not being serious what so ever (I know she is joking don’t worry she’s fine mentally) which gets old after the 100th time. She rambles about things and is Incredibly awkward and says  ignorant racist remarks about my black friend who invited her into the party. We have all spoken and decided if we’re on and there’s five of us on we are limiting the party so she can’t join just so we can avoid the immaturity. Now they want her out and I’m the one who has to do it cause I’m the cousin even though I told them not to invite her initially. WIBTA if I spoke to her about her attitude  and removed her?

Forgot to mention that she only plays fortnite and Rainbow 6 siege and will only want to play that with us and will constantly ask to play."	Not the A-hole	0	0	279.0	47.0	0.0	0.0
c1b4sy	2019-06-16 15:30:13	FraBol7	AITA for cancelling plans with a friend after telling him I was available?	"I'm on mobile, so sorry for any formatting errors.

Yesterday my friend, let's call him Ted, asked a group chat if we wanted to play soccer. I immediately answered yes since I didn't want to stay home all day. Only one other person said yes and the rest either didn't respond or were unavailable. 

About one hour after the chat Ted privately asked me where I was, since it was 5 pm and that's the usual time we play. I told him that I wasn't coming if there was only three of us. Ted called me and said I was an asshole because I said yes and he was already at the soccer pitch (which is very close to his house, about a two minute walk) waiting for me. I explained that I didn't wanna play if there was only three of us because it wouldn't be very fun imo (this isn't the first time only three of us played). He cussed me out and hung up. 

So reddit, AITA?

Edit: for clarification, Ted asked the group chat who was available at about 4:15 pm, and the third guy responded only at about 4:45 pm. This isn't the first time only three of us are available, and every other time we didn't end up playing because of the lack of people. I was about to cancel, but he messaged me first saying that he was already there. Usually I'm the earliest person at the pitch, and I always text them that I'm about to head out, in case someone cancels."	Asshole	0	0	109.0	29.0	0.0	0.0
c1b3lh	2019-06-16 15:26:53		AITA for not greeting my (21M) family friends’ kid?	"For context, my family (mum, dad, older brother and I) moved to a new country when I was only 2 years old. We soon after befriended a family (2 parents and a son) whom were from the same country as us. Our families have been close for about 15 years now and visit each other every now and then. 

When I was around 8 years old, they had a new baby (let’s refer to her as Nancy) who I met literally the day she was born. Every time our families visit each other, it’s a bit of a drag for me, but I always do my best to be kind and respectful. That includes greeting everyone, but since she was young, Nancy has been very shy, and as a result never acknowledges my (or anyone’s) greeting. She literally just avoids eye contact and ignores the greeting. Typically, after some ice breaking time she will start to talk to my mum a bit, but that’s the extent of it.

Obviously when she was younger, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. A young girl being shy in front of someone? Perfectly normal. It didn’t bother me much, until she got older. At 10 years old she was still doing this, and at that point I thought “this is just plain disrespect now”. No matter how shy someone is, to completely ignore somebody who is kindly greeting you, especially a family friend, is unacceptable at that age. I thought her parents should have taught her this basic formality at a certain point, but they had not. 

So a few years ago, I just stopped greeting her entirely. I’ll say hi and hug the mother, I’ll say hi and handshake the dad and the son, but I just won’t acknowledge the daughter. Why should I if she’ll just ignore me? She’s around 12 now and is too old for me to excuse such behaviour. 

My family thinks I’m an asshole for never greeting her anymore. They say that she’s just a little shy, but I argue that she needs to learn some respect at this age. AITA?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Until around January of this year the dress code said all men who've work there had to be clean shaven, they recently changed it allowing facial hair. This was a very public thing that and corporate came down to ""explain"" the new dress code. The beard thing was pretty much just mentioned because most of the changes were for women's uniforms and I work with mostly women. So I decided to grow a beard and was told about a week later that the only beards allowed were filled out (the pictures that they showed were at least a month and a half worth of beard growth) and I was told if my beard didn't look like that in a week I would be fired. When I asked about the rule change I was told that I was allowed to have a beard but not grow a beard. So because I needed the job I shaved, they then went on to hire several men with beards, and even had one guy completely shave his beard and regrow it, so I decided to grow it out anyway since they said nothing about the other person. Again I was pulled aside and shown the pictures. When I pointed out that only one of the 6 people with facial hair was even close to the pictures he tried to make a few other people shave as well but of course they didn't because they were all hired under the assumption that their facial hair was appropriate.

c1b1pc	2019-06-16 15:21:58	-originaleusername-	WIBTA if I put an ultimatum to me moving out earlier than I should to my parents?	"OK just for context my family and I live in a town that's about 45 min from the capital. Me and my older sister used to be in the same room when we were younger but I moved out into my dad's old cabinet. 

That was about a year and a half ago and the room was full of his stuff and it still is. 

The only thing that is mine in the room is my bed and my clothes under the bed. There's a path from the door to the bed and from the bed to the door on to the balcony. Everything else is his stuff + my not-yet-assembled closet from IKEA. Yup, I don't even have a closet and need to resort to bins and boxes for my clothes. The problem with this is that I have a lot of clothes that I didn't ask for because my sister and my cousin give me their old clothes. I don't like all of them so I don't wear them because my mom doesn't let me donate them. She is annoyed with me because I always have a mess in my ""closet"" and shames me/guilts me because I don't wear all of my clothes.

If you're wondering why my dad doesn't clean his stuff out is because he is dealing with some stuff. Trouble with work, health issues (mostly diet related and his chronic pain in his shoulder) and extreme procrastination. I do get his troubles but I don't have any personal space (my desk is in the living room) and not even a closet. 

Currently I am finnishing 8. grade and what would be 10. grade is the 1. year of highschool. In highschool I have an option to live in a dormitory but it's not necessary since it's a 45 min commute that my dad and sister already make. But the thing is I would have my room and a closet there.

I see the minuses because I could live in our house (and it wasn't cheap they are still paying it off) so it isn't the best financial option. If I do decide to go I would be home for the weekends and holidays.

So the ultimatum that I am debating is that if my closet isn't assembeled this summer break they don't have to try because I would already decide to move out and that my room should be cleaned the next school year.

c1b0yb	2019-06-16 15:20:02		AITA for pressing charges against teens who smashed my son's scooter?	"A bit context first. My son(9) usually spends time at the skatepark during the weekends with his friends. He likes scooting and have been active for the last 3 months now. Some of his friends also use a scooter, while some of them are skateboarding. I thought scooting was the best alternative to begin with, but recently he is been going on about a skateboard. So this past Saturday I dropped him off by the skatepark. When I came to pick him up 2 hours later, I see him approching the car with a skateboard in his hand. I was confused, so I asked him ""Where's your scooter?"". ""I'm not a scooter looser anymore, these cool guys gave me a skateboard!"",he replied excited. I thought for a second, before asking him what happened to his skateboard. Apparently, some teenage boys had given him a skateboard in exchange for breaking his scooter on camera. The situation was clear for me now. I often watch skateboarding videos on Youtube as I am a former skater by myself. Theese douchbags had used my young son for a youtube video. If you don't know the context, it is about teenagers ""converting"" scooter kids to skaters, while filming themselves smashing their ""exchaged"" scooters. I was terribly annoyed by this as I've spent money on that scooter. So I got him to point out the guys. I headed straight to them and confronted them. I demanded them to give me my money back as things should not be destroyed for a goddamn youtube video. They refused and we had an argument. They insisted that since my son had told them it was okay to break his scooter in exchange for a skateboard, it was okay. I ended up calling the police. I had pressed charges against them. However, some of our teenage relatives had a different view on this, talking about how it was my son's choice, and that it was cool for him making deals with other people. They also called me a dick for making a fuzz. I know he wanted to start skateboarding,  but on the other hand that scooter costed money. We could have sold it. So AITA reddit?"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1azs2	2019-06-16 15:16:53		AITA for bailing on someone after they annoyed me and my friend all day?	"I had made plans over a week ago to go to my friend Ann’s place to hang out with her, her boyfriend and his friend.

Over the weekend my city had this free street fair kinda thing with street performers and art, the only part that cost money was the concerts of local artists.

My friend Joe reminded me of this fair a week ago and wanted us to meet him and his group there, so I asked Ann if she’d want to go. We agreed that if we went we would only do the free stuff, and would wait until I got to her place to set plans in stone, I passed this on to Joe.

Throughout the week Joe keeps asking if we’re going, I tell him we won’t know until i get to Ann’s house the day of.

Day arrives, all day Joe is asking if we’re going, are we bussing or driving, did we get our concert tickets, etc. I repeat the same answers each time. He then texts Ann asking her all these same questions. At this point we are both a little annoyed since I’d told Joe the same thing more than once. She gives him the same answers I’ve been giving.

Joe texts me back, saying he doesn’t think Ann and the rest of our group want to go, so if I wanted I could just come alone and hang out with his friends and crash at his place. I tell him a) I had plans with Ann before this fair came up so if our group decided not to go I wasnt ditching her and b) it wasn’t that we didn’t want to go, it was that we had told him more than once that we wouldn’t know if we were going until I got to Ann’s place and could make sure everyone was on the same page.

I get there, we all decide to go and take the bus down. I tell this to Joe and tell him I’ll text him when we get there. We didn’t know how long it would be (shit bus system). It took about 30min from the time we left Ann’s til we got there, in that time Joe calls me 4 times. I can tell as soon as he speaks that he’s very drunk, none of us are too excited to deal with that (to be clear, we don’t care if someone is drunk unless they are a sloppy kind of drunk).

We arrive and Joe and his group (roommate and 2 others) basically grab us right as we get off the bus before we have a chance to process what’s happening. Ann, who isn’t great with crowds, is immediately overwhelmed by this so her boyfriend focuses on making sure she is comfortable.

We start looking around and eventually realize we’ve been separated from Joe’s group. Between being annoyed by his texts and calls all day and how drunk they were, we weren’t eager to go out of our way to find them. The event wasn’t as good as the website made it out to be, so my group decides to uber back to Ann’s. I text Joe this along with a half-assed apology for the night not going as planned. He asked if he upset us and that was why we were leaving, but not being one for confrontation and not wanting this to start drama (it would have) I just brushed it off as us not enjoying the event and left it at that. We ended up having a good time back at Ann’s place.

c1azii	2019-06-16 15:16:10		AITA for not wanting to date this girl anymore because I found her with another guy right after I asked her out?	Recently, I asked out a girl (let's call her Cara) from one of my classes in college. We've been friends for about 6 months now. For some background, I'm a virgin and I've never had a girlfriend. When I asked her out, we agreed to go out for dinner and a movie on a Saturday night. The Friday before our scheduled date, we were both invited to a party at a friend's house. I'm not really into partying and drinking, but decided to go anyways. At the party, we both met a guy (we'll call him Conner). I didn't think much of him and decided to play cards with some of my friends. Later during the night, I was looking for one of my friends to give him back his phone that he dropped. I walked into one of the bedrooms and saw Cara giving Conner a blowjob. They both didn't see me because they were faced the other way. I quickly darted out of the room and soon left the party. I felt a little hurt about the whole thing, but that oh well, she can do whatever she wants with her body. The next day, Cara texted me confirming the time of the movie and dinner. I made an excuse and told her that I couldn't make it and told her I'd let her know an alternate time I'd be available. Tbh, I don't really want to date her anymore. Sex is something that I only want to have in a committed relationship and I prefer to date someone who shares those values. I don't I can have a relationship with someone with different values than me. I'm not sure how to tell her I'm not interested anymore. I know we were never exclusive, but my gut is telling me to move on. She owes me nothing, but at the same time, I don't owe her anything either. AITA?		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

it's father's day and my mum was trying to get my 3yr old step-sister (we'l call her bo) to sign the card. she wasn't having it and my mum said she couldn't go and play until she signed the card. fair enough. as i come downstairs to sign the card myself, i see my mum grab Bo's arm and drag her through the hallway and lightly push her against the door. she starts crying because she's 3. i sign the card but just as i'm about to get to the top of the stairs, mum full on, red faced screams in Bo's face. so loud that it actually echos around the house. remember that Bo is 3. this makes Bo cry even more, causing mum to scream in her face again but less loudly this time. i ask mum if she wants me to take Bo up and i'll get her to sign the card. she says no and that Bo can stand her until she signs the card. i say ok and go up which makes Bo cry again but i hear my mum swear and mutter under her breath as she checks on dinner. 10 minutes later i hear Bo climbing up my stairs and she is distraught. her face is bright red from the crying and her arm is slightly red and she doesn't say anything, just hugs me. she has the card and shows me that she signed it. i text mum to say that Bo signed the card and is in my room. my mum screams up the stairs telling Bo to come down. Bo bursts into tears again and i carry her downstairs and don't leave her side until after tea when she calms down. my mum called me an asshole for thinking that i could parent better then her and says that i 'ruined father's day' because of my selfish actions. my stepdad comes up to my room later that night after work and tells me that i should've just let my mum deal with the situation.

AITA? 

btw screaming at people is more common in my house then normal talking at this point but it has never gone this far before. my mum even told me she made a vow to never scream like that to any of her children after me because she did to me when i was young and that's why she blames herself for my anxiety/depression"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Some people buy it for the month (commuters) and then sell the ability to use it on weekends. Person A owns the pass. Person A sold me the pass for Friday evening and told me to give the pass to Person B for Saturday. 

I did that and person B is saying I didn’t give it to her in time. Person A is now demanding I pay for what Person B would have paid her.  

Thing is I needed the pass on Saturday too and person A knew that. Person B returned the pass to Person A when she found it around 10 am Saturday morning. Person A did not give me the pass for use on the rest of Saturday 

Normally I would just pay the $10 but I’ve found person A to be very rude via text message. I use her pass all the time and was expecting some more professional courtesy but she is basically accusing me of lying. Furthermore, there was no late fee set up for the situation in advance. 

Person As POV:  I missed out on a sale and I’m only going to ask the Friday person to pay up because the Saturday person has been a customer longer. I want my $10 

My POV: I can get the pass from someone else. I can afford to pay for my own. Person A wanted me to hand the pass off to Person B myself without her getting involved. Seems like that’s the cost of business. I was going to pay her anyway but people tell me I’m too generous with my money and this person never works with me or shows flexibility towards me in any way."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	58.0	8.0	0.0	0.0
c1ax27	2019-06-16 15:09:43	b887797	AITA: got angry at my brother for commenting on my weight	"A few years ago, I \[25F\] moved to a city 1,5 hours away with my long-term boyfriend \[27M\]. My family comes to visit regularly, both as a family and separately. With ""family"", I mean my one brother \[19M\] and parents. My other brother \[22M\], even though both brothers still live in my home town, never comes to visit or talk. He does not even call or text me. I called him at first, but I stopped when I noticed this became very one-sided. He has only called or contacted me when he needed something from me. My little brother tells me he has the same experience with my brother. However, when we still lived at home, we all talked a lot and seemed to have a good relationship, but he seems to put in no effort now we live in separate cities. I often (around once a month) visit my hometown, but I rarely see my brother even though he has no job or other obligations. He does go to the gym a lot, and has become very sports-oriented. My parents gave him a house to live in while he has no job or school.

I have been very stressed out for the past two years (I am in grad school while working on the side), which led to some over-eating and some weight gain. I am not obese, just slightly overweight now. As a child I was always very thin, but I also struggled with an eating disorder when I was younger. Me and my boyfriend have been eating healthier for a few months now.

Anyway, today my family came over for a birthday visit. This is the second time in 2,5 years my brother has been to my home, even though my other family members have been there at least 5 times. In the span of the 3 hour visit, my brother mentioned my weight several times, even to the point of saying I was ""gross"", and told me I could be more like him and go to the gym. He said I was neglecting myself, and kept stressing he was ""worried about my health"". I told him I eat & exercise the exact same way as my boyfriend, who has great metabolism and just stays very thin. Why doesn't he say the same things to my boyfriend? Also, I told him it was hurtful to me that the only time we see each other this year, he has to mention my weight in this way while I am hosting a birthday party in my own home. If he wanted to be supportive or worried about my health, he could have said something else, or ask instead of assuming, or talk at some other time instead of ignoring me all the time.

He did not even react to me being upset and did not at all apologize, and refused to back down (""I stand by my comments, they were not meant as hurtful!""). I told him I could say plenty things about how he was living his life (not working or going to school, living off my parents), but I choose not to (which might not have been the nicest thing to say, but I was pretty hurt). I also told him he was an asshole, and that if he acted this way, he does not need to come to my home anymore. My mother told both of us to ""be nice to each other"".

As such, I've been working my ass off trying to study for this final exam- which is tomorrow.

Today is Father's Day, and while I acknowledge that family is important, it's also really important that I do REALLY well on this exam.

I'm honestly kind of pissed because I need that study time and feel like my family is being honestly super inconsiderate. My parents are both on vacation right now from school and we could just go somewhere tomorrow after my exam, but apparently we have to go today.

My father is a great cook who is used to making meals for more than two people. So Every time he has cooked since it’s just be him and I, he’s always made more than enough for that night. As a result, we have leftovers in the fridge throughout the weekdays constantly. I am a 20M who is 5’7, so I don’t eat a whole lot. 

I keep telling him that I will take care of the leftovers throughout the week so he doesn’t have to worry about food going to waste. I have no issues with eating leftovers, since he’s such a good cook. 

Well, the other night I come home from work late at night (8pm) and unbeknownst to me, he had made a whole store bought lasagna for me, and he had something else. Again, he knows that I eat leftovers during the week and that I am real strict about my calorie intake,  

I told him that I was just going to have leftovers instead of the lasagna he had already made. Well, he got very upset about this and became passive aggressive for the rest of the night. I finally took a small piece of the lasagna to please him, but it was too late anyway.

c1aor4	2019-06-16 14:48:29	throwawaylindsey	AITA for sending a Tinder asshole to McDonald's?	"I’m using an alt for obvious reasons. 

For backstory, I’m female and live in the U.S. I’m on dating apps and I’m finding that a lot of guys are just disrespectful. Some of them are polite and want to start an actual conversation, but a lot, maybe even the majority, are just ridiculous.

A lot of the messages I get are “wanna fuck?” or “what are you looking for?” which is their way of indirectly saying “I want sex with minimal effort”. I even have in my profile that I don’t do random hookups, but I think I overestimated how often people actually read the profiles.

After having this happen a dozen times, I finally snap. A guy on Tinder messages me and the conversation seems to be going okay at first. We message back and forth and then I don’t hear a response. That’s okay, people get busy. 

At around 11:30 pm he hits me with the “Sorry, I got busy. What are you up to? Wanna have some fun?” During our initial conversation I make it crystal clear, I’m not looking for hookups. I don’t to casual sex. So I remind him of this, and he starts negging me. “I knew you’d be a prude”, “not sure why you wasted my time”, “let’s just meet up at my house and talk and see where things go.” 

Finally I was like, “okay, but come to my house.” and then I proceed to give him the address of a McDonald’s. In the next town over. I waited for him to get close to the location, he confirmed that he was about 5 mins away, and I unmatched him.

I just reached my breaking point with shitty men who feel entitled to ENTER MY BODY. I know the right thing to do would be to not engage, but also part of me feels like he deserved it.

I can already imagine what y’all are going to say but reddit, AITA?

Edit: Thank you all for the reddit silver, the blunt feedback, and the laughs. And to the several (presumably) men who PMed me to let me know I'm a fucking bitch who should die, let's discuss this some more at my house. I'll send you my address."	Not the A-hole	0	0	12.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

Stripper and I walk over to the area where they do private dances and starts slapping her tits against my face to the beat of the music. Fine, cool. For some reason instead of just enjoying the experience though, I stopped the dance out and  randomly told the stripper that what she is doing is not a good thing for society although it might cover your bills.

After the drop off, headed to the restroom, my 18 YO son had to go also. As we head down the poorly lit hallway, I see the door and start to turn into the restroom and see the sign for the ladies room. At the exact moment my son tells me, ""Dad, that's the ladies RR.""

Some guy was walking opposite direction from us and made this LOUD annoying chuckle, ""HEHEHEHEHE.""  I'm thinking, come on, sign isn't easy to see and I checked before entering.

Step forward to go into the men's RR and the guy shouts out from 20 feet away, ""That's the ladies room bruh!"" I shouted back, ""I'm NOT your bruh.""  I did this because he really didn't need to shout out like a snot-nosed brat and people make mistakes.

I head to the urinals, and guess who shows up right behind me? Yup, the 'bruh'.  He actually tries to call me out and start a fight. Tells me I've some nerve shooting my mouth off to him like that.  He yells a bit, makes a scene, a couple other guys are looking over like WTF!?!  

I tell him, ""Dumbass, you realize you're in an airport? I call Security, they come, you WILL NOT FLY TODAY.  Oh, and I'm sure TSA would love to know why you're such an angry little brat and maybe not let you fly at all.  NOW, turn around and walk out while you can...""

Yesterday my friends and I went tubing about an hour away from our city. I drove my Jeep and took two people with me while three other friends drove separately. At the end of it, when we’re all heading back to our vehicles, I got into an argument with the two people I drove. We were all drinking, but I didn’t have as much since I was driving back. Anyways. One was mad and just didn’t want to talk to anybody because he had lost his phone on one of the chutes. The other one kept making comments like “I told you so”, “you should’ve listened to us when we left our phones”, yada yada. I was trying to tell her to just drop it because he was clearly livid, but that turned into me “taking his side”. At this point, we’re already in my vehicle but we’re still arguing. I wasn’t trying to take sides. I was just trying to get her to stop making those types of comments to him. Welllll... my friend who lost his phone eventually said “fuck this” and just got out. The other friend that was making comments got out right after him. They told me they were just going to get a ride with the other people we met up with. After they started walking off, I backed out and was en route home. Fast forward about 15 minutes and I get a call from one of the other girls. She was mad at me for “leaving them” and told me to go back for them. Eventually, after I tried explaining what happened, she told me that they’re already picking them up. Was it messed up for me to go home after all of this?

WIBTA for leaving my friends when they’re the ones that said they would get a ride and walked off?

c1ahoe	2019-06-16 14:30:17	yeetethtohell	AITA for not drawing my 8yo cousin a card per my mother's request?	"Most minor holidays, my family celebrates birthdays, and for Father's day, one of the birthday's we're celebrating is my 8 year old cousin's birthday. 

Now, because I'm the artist in my family, my mom likes to ask me to draw pictures, mainly cards, for people or for herself.

I always say no.

This isn't out of spitefulness, I just genuinely don't like drawing cards or being forced to draw something I suck at(my mom has wanted me to draw my sister's dog a picture for his birthday. I suck at drawing animals).

This pisses my mom off. A LOT.

Today, my mom of course asks me if I can draw the 8 year old cousin a birthday card. I said no. This time, she basically throws a fit. I tell her why, and she twists it into me never wanting to do anything for her and that there's always an excuse. She then tells me to clean my room, because she's not gonna let me do nothing all day and if I don't then she'll ""take away my laptop and everything else."" 

Now this sounds like a normal punishment, right? The thing is, my mom never punishes us. I've been 'grounded' once because my mom was mad at my dad or someone else, and when I was like, 5, I got put in timeout only once, and that was because I didn't want to take a bath. So, I'm not really gonna take her seriously in this, though it's infuriating because she wouldn't threaten my brother with that even though he does the same thing(watching YouTube and playing games all day)

She leaves my room finally, but is still going on about it. My brother offers to draw the card, and she says that it's fine and she has it covered, then yells at me that I shouldn't even bother with making one now. Okay, not like I was going to. 

I don't know how long she kept bringing it up while I was doing my own thing, but it must've been for another 5-10 minutes.

So here I have to ask, AITA?

Edit- She apologized to me about getting so mad, but said she just gets frustrated because me and my sister both say no to doing things or forget to do it. I also apologized to her about the whole ordeal."	Not the A-hole	0	0	130.0	13.0	0.0	0.0

I could get into them but it's fathers day and I don't necessarily want to voice all of our problems since it might make him seem like a bad guy. But just know that we argue a lot and do not see eye to eye on a lot of things. I can't remember the last time I or him said that we loved each other or showed any sort of emotion towards each other that doesn't involve rage or simple indifference.

I put on a card ""I appreciate you even if it doesn't seem like it - love DrillwormBazookaMan"" I'm not a big gift or sentimental person. Being given gifts makes me really uncomfortable and I loathe having to give people gifts not because I hate the person but because I overthink things and it just fills me with anxiety. 

My mother and friend think I'm an asshole for this. They think what I said was a harsh way of saying it, and I guess I can agree but I don't know what else to say. I don't see an issue with it because I personally would love to be told I was appreciated. I even put the word love in there! I never do that.

"Parts of Eastern Europe have a tradition on 5th December where they bring in a “devil” to the children if they’ve done something naughty (hint:not cleaning your room, so all kids). The costumes are scary and they tell them they’ll “take them to hell” if they don’t behave. In some instances they even put them in a sack and pretend to take them to hell. I’d advise watching the video to get the full picture. Skip to 1:40ish. 

Then an angel comes and gives them presents but I’ve been watching some YouTube videos. The comments seem to think it’s funny (parents) but I think it’s pretty cruel. Maybe even a bit traumatic. 
 
My husband had it happen to him every year until he was 8 and thinks it’s a “nice tradition”. He’s adamant we will start with our child when she’s 3. I’m also adamant that we will NOT be doing that to our little one.

This person was someone in my grade who I always saw being alone and picked on. I want to clarify this person had no disabilities or any type of mental issues. One day they had to ride my bus and I decided to be a kind soul and let them sit by me. I shared a cookie I had bought from the school store and we became friends. I never really took into thought why this person had no friends or was being picked on, but I soon realized why. 

This person never left me alone. They never respected personal space and always made everything about themselves. If I brought up a personal issue of mine they would immediately make themselves sound as if they had my issue worse. And when I stoped talking to them about personal issues they got mad and kept telling me things like, “But were best friends, you should trust me with anything, because I trust you.” And would then proceed to make me feel bad about it. 

The friendship even ruined my mental health a bit. I know, sounds over dramatic, but they didn’t understand the word phrase “personal space” at all. 

When I got sick and tired of it I tried telling the person how they were making me feel, and then the person would soon realize what I was trying to say and would just walk off in anger. They never would listen to me! I even told them to just stop sitting with me at lunch and they would get mad at that and yell at me for it always. 

I’m still really their only friend, and it makes me feel bad to ty and abandon them, but I just can’t take it anymore. 

So, AITA for trying to get rid of this person in my life?

I grew up in the midwest but moved to the east coast for college 16 years ago. 10 years ago, my dad moved to a western state. I don't know anybody in his state except for him and his girlfriend. I think due to the fact that he was widowed at a relatively young age, he has become overly attached to me and my brother. I think it's even worse with me because my brother is engaged and I'm single AF and don't have any justifiable reason (in his mind) to withdraw. 

In the past, my dad has visited me a couple times a year in my city (which is also a very popular tourist destination) but I don't have any great desire to go to his (also a cool city, but I don't know anybody there). He doesn't see me not knowing anybody there as a problem because he wants to spend every goddamn waking hour with me. It's suffocating. We don't have the best relationship due to his suffocating me, but he sees it as me being cold and nasty. He doesn't get it and is isn't interested in getting it. 

I'm a teacher and so I have the summers mostly off. I've already planned a trip to French Polynesia for mid-late July and a trip to Canada for late August just before school starts again. I have a month free before my first trip, but I'd really just like to chill out at home and relax. I don't want to go to visit my dad but he's really pushing for it. I haven't explicitly stated ""I don't want to go"" because I know that would kill him, but have mentioned wanting to stay here while I'm not traveling and chill out. He just keeps saying over and over ""I hope you can come"".

I got kicked out on my 16th birthday, it was an extremely dysfunctional household, so I’m glad I got out of there. She has been an extremely selfish person her whole life. Giving the least to her children, we would go hungry, she would scream at us for taking food out of the cupboard. We barely had any clothes and she would take us to school in her Mercedes with a really ripped bag and holes in our shoes. When she kicked me out she kicked me out with a few bin liners filled with my clothes, no money or a phone to contact anybody. The reason she did this won’t me mentioned but I’ve spoken to friends about it and they’re shocked at how she reacted. Safe to say I hold some resentment I’m working through.

When I moved out she had already inherited the house and the money. We didn’t talk for a year and then got back in touch and started building our relationship again. 

I had a conversation with her a while ago about my grandfathers will. I asked her why she wouldn’t let me see it, she refuses to let anyone see it. I was a part of his life and I’m sure he would have passed down some of his livelihood to his two grandchildren. He was a professor and I find it hard to believe he didn’t write anything out for us. She started manipulating her way out of it, crying and talking about how it’s her money and her house. I said that either way you’ve been neglectful to us our whole lives, you haven’t supported us at all, we were in his lives too. While you were living it up in all the glory of a huge house and nice cars, paying for your boyfriends flights over to UK and buying him designer belts and bags, we had to cope with being kicked (she’s kicked most of us out for the stupidest reasons) out and living in grotty hostels for years of our lives until we were old enough to rent a flat. We watched as she showered him with gifts while we were struggling. For fuck sake she won’t even pay for her kids to go to any event she isn’t involved in and she gives them a haircut once a month. 

So I told her she’s neglectful, I said I wanted to see the will. I want to see the documents, I have a right to see the will. She went on to try and dodge what I asked. I pushed the subject and she then suddenly shifted her perspective. She said she’d pay for my driving lessons if I wanted. She said she’d be more supportive. That hasn’t happened. 

Jump to now, these feeling are resurfacing because she is now showering her new husband with our grandads money and still refuses to show us the will.

c1a6r0	2019-06-16 14:00:55	AdventurousBlock0	AITA for blaming my best friend for her string of bad relationships? She’s intent on making the WORST relationship choices and I had enough.	"I’ll call my friend Beth (fake name). Beth is 21, and we’ve been friends since elementary school. We were always inseparable, and even know, we’re each other’s closest friends. Also for context, I’m a 21 year old bisexual male.

So when Beth was 16, she got into this “relationship” with this 22-year old trash dude, I’ll call Chad (16 is legal in my state, but I know, super creepy). He would encourage/pressure her to skip school, introduced her to smoking (cigarettes and weed), introduced her to alcohol. Don’t get me wrong; we were 16 and she might’ve found all those things anyways. But to say this creep was NOT a good influence on her would be an understatement. They broke up after a year because he cheated on her with his ex. This devastated Beth, but she eventually got over it.

Her next (serious) relationship was when she was 20 and dated this 17-year old high school junior. They moved in because he had a bad home life after like 3 months, but broke up after another 9 months (this was last week), because she was dating a teenager with the mindset of a 13-year old, and he was cheating on her pretty much the entire relationship. 

She was devastated about the break-up. especially after he revealed he was with all of these other girls from his school (presumably to hurt her). Her personality has changed; she’s turning into one of those “men ain’t shit” feminists. My boyfriend just left for a research program, and she’s pretty much non-stop saying things like “he’s going to cheat on you”, “all men do”.

Finally, after her last “you really think a gay man at a new environment will stay faithful? You’re naive” comment, I told her that unlike her, I can actually pick decent guys to be in relationships with. Just because she’s intent on choosing literally the worst, trashiest, deadbeats she becomes attracted to doesn’t mean other relationships can’t work out, and that if she wants a relationship to actually work out, she should start by having standards, first.

She didn’t argue or anything; just broke down in tears and left. I kinda feel bad because I know I was kind of harsh. But I do think there’s actual merit in my words. She needs to pick somebody she’s compatible with, has common interests with, and work well together with; not just some random guy that just expressed an interest in her. I really do feel like she’s putting herself in these situations. AITA for pointing it out?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c1a0hz	2019-06-16 13:42:35	youhavebeenindicted	AITA for leaving my cousin on his birthday?	"My cousin who I never hang out with turned 25 and invited me out to a night drinking with his friends.

He tells me he's invited plenty of people, and says there will be at least 20 - 30 people at pre drinks which is being held at one of his friends place nearby.

I arrive and there's maybe 6 people there, one of the 5 close friends he invited actually arrived. No biggie, it sucks his good mates didn't turn up but I'm glad I'm there for him because I think having no one turn up on your birthday is rough enough.

We end up going out to a bar, I offer to buy him a drink and I get us 4 drinks. He buys me one drink and asks for the money it cost him. I paid the $50 fare for the uber to get him, and his two friends out, with zero acknowledgement. I wasn't looking for compensation, just gratitude, but it's his birthday, so I didn't get too beat up about it.

It's 1 AM and he comes up to me as I'm still talking to the girl I've met and says him and his two other friends are going somewhere else down the road, and I say that I'm gonna stay here with the girl, because she was giving me signs she wanted to take me back to hers. I said Ill let him know what happens in the next 15 mins as the place was closing soon.

She asks me back to hers and I text him saying I was gonna go back with her, he responds with a text saying that was cool.

I wake up, it's mid morning, and I see my phone is at 5% battery. I call him and he doesn't answer. I text him asking if he's awake and could possibly pick me up because my phone was about to die, and gave him the address. He lives maybe 20 mins from the place, and I figured it would be worth asking incase my phone died in the process of getting an uber, leaving me stranded as I'd left her house already.

No response, so I called an uber again and as he pulled up the phone died. $80 later being gridlocked in traffic for what was supposed to be a 20 min drive, I arrive at his house. He's been awake for hours. He's happy to see me and we talk about the night, I tell him I went home with someone (first time I've literally ever had a one night stand) and he shows no praise, fair enough.

I later find out he has told literally all his friends (even the ones who didn't show up) that I ditched him on his birthday despite literally being the only one who went, paid for almost everything and saw the night out with him until 1 AM, and they all gave me a hard time for it. Am I an asshole for leaving him with his actual friends to go home with a girl? or should I have stayed, despite being expected to fund the entire night because it was his birthday?

**TLDR: I went home with a girl on my cousins 25th birthday at 1AM after paying for the uber there, buying him drinks all night and being one of two friends who actually went out with him despite inviting all his close mates, am I an asshole or was I supposed to go home with him instead of the girl as he only stayed out for maybe another hour?**"	Not the A-hole	0	0	861.0	72.0	0.0	0.0

"Last weekend my dad told me that he was planning a Father's Day celebration with his side of the family and that I should think about coming in. My parents are divorced and I decided to stay with my mother this summer as I am home from college. Her and my father live in different states and the drive would be around 4 hours. I had originally planned to come in on the Friday of Father's Day weekend and leave on Monday.  

I'd been having some car issues recently and believed that my battery was low. We had scheduled an appointment earlier in the week to get a new one and it just so happened to be on Saturday. So, I had told my father there would be a change of plans and that I would come in that afternoon instead, no problem. I got the new battery and prepped to leave. Prior to my departure, I learned that the state I pass through was getting blasted with rain for the remainder of the day. I decided err on the side of caution and told him that I would be coming in first thing Sunday (Father's Day) morning.

This morning, I woke up after some not-so-good sleep (don't know why) and prepped to leave. I decided to check the weather once more as this part of the country has been getting rocked by bad weather for the last month. I noticed that for a good portion of the trip I would be, once again, driving into and following a large storm. While I would have loved to see my father, I chose to stay back. Due to the poor sleep I had gotten last night, I felt that my decision making would not have been as sharp and my gut was telling me it was not worth the risk. 

The phone call I just made to him was a tough one as he verbally expressed his disappointment. I paced around this morning trying to weigh the pros and cons of the situation as this was a tough moral quandary for me to navigate. AITA for not feeling comfortable driving in bad weather?"

c19z1b	2019-06-16 13:37:52	forgotmyotherpasswdx	AITA for confronting a woman for staring at my husband on the train?	"This happened yesterday. I was on my way to the mall with my husband and toddler.  There was this woman standing near us on the train that kept looking at my husband.  It seemed to me like she was checking him out.  Our entire ride lasted about 20-25 minutes and she was looking at him almost the entire time. My husband didn’t seem to notice but he’s oblivious when it comes to things like that. 

The woman got off at the same stop that we did. At this stop you have to walk up to the top platform to exit. And by this time I’m watching the woman as well. And she *still* keeps looking! At this point I’m convinced she’s trying to make eye contact.

When we all got up the stairs I decided to say something.  My husband had my daughter in his arms and I asked him if he could go refill our metro card. While he was occupied, I walked up to the woman and asked why she kept staring at my husband. She goes “Oh I wasn’t. I was just zoned out”.  I can’t remember my exact phrasing but I basically said  “Well you should probably watch how you stare at men when they’re out with their families.” After that I just walked off. 

I have this bad tendency to replay situations over and over so I’ve been thinking about that incident again this morning. Some opinions on whether I was in the wrong would be much appreciated.

*Edit: I was trying to respond to people’s questions in the comments but they’re all getting downvoted/buried, so I guess people can’t see. I explained why I know she wasn’t staring because of my child and why I think it unlikely that she was “zoned out”. I also explained why, from my perspective, it was fairly obvious my husband and I were a couple. I don’t really have anything else to add. Clearly people think I’m the asshole and that’s fine. I guess I overreacted.*

c19wiu	2019-06-16 13:30:09	grim_melee	AITA for grounding my son from his phone.	"I’m divorced, and I have full custody of three kids; two boys (ages 12.5 & 10.5) and one daughter (age 8). This is the first summer we were divorced and the way the custody is for the summer my ex wife and I alternate every two weeks (the kids are with her two weeks, then me, then her again, etc).

So I have a home phone, but my ex wife does not, just her own cell phone. She leaves my oldest to watch his other two siblings occasionally and I wasn’t comfortable with him not having a way to call the outside world so I bought him a burner phone that I buy phone cards for occasionally.

Well he had several conditions that I told him of he broke he’d lose it. One was that the phone couldn’t be locked and his siblings should be able to use it (to call or text - not play games) whenever they want. Also he has to allow me to access his phone once in a while to check up on him.

So he locked his phone - specifically to keep his siblings from accessing it. I told him to turn the passcode off. A couple weeks ago. This week we went on vacation to Disney World and I noticed his phone still had a lock. I told him remove the password lock while I was watching since he hadn’t. Then while he was I noticed he had the reddit app installed. Reddit is a pretty great site but it’s nooooooot appropriate for a twelve-year-old at all. I told him to delete it and stay off the site for now.

Finally yesterday we were driving home, the first half of our drive was 7 hours and we were going to stop at a hotel for the night. His phone died half way thru the drive and he wanted to plug his phone in either where the iPad was being used (for his two siblings in the back seat) or unplug my phone that I was using for GPS. I told him no and he has never had such a sour attitude as I experienced for 3 hours. I was done with him.

And then later that night at the hotel around midnight I got up to use the restroom and saw he was on his phone hiding it under the covers. I took it from him and saw he was on Reddit (yeah I know, at least it’s not porn). He had never deleted the Reddit app and had basically pretended to delete it from me.

So I grounded him basically saying he only gets his phone while with his mom since he’s continually broken my trust with it and prioritizes over everything else.

Ironically the subreddit he was on was r/entitledparents.

Am I being too harsh? I feel guilty and he was sobbing when I took it away and told him he was grounded (he’s already a moody preteen). I know I’m not wrong but should my punishment be less severe? I mean he just plays games and Pokemon Go. It’s more about him lying and being deceitful at this point to me.

Edit 1: there have been a lot of interesting opinions with advice and perspectives for me to think about for sure. I probably won’t keep him grounded as long but will have some stronger parental controls on his phone until he’s probably 14-ish. Also it’s clear which comments are coming from parents and which are coming from kids, which I like having the perspectives but also find the divide somewhat humorous.

To add to my son’s and my relationship, we have a good one. We’re close, but he’s still clearly on the “child” side of being a preteen/teenager. We’ve been driving back today and he even apologized to me for everything and asked how he could “earn back” his phone early. I’m going to have a conversation with him when we get home and talk about a lot of points people have brought up here. But like I said, we’re close. We fish together, camp, game together, I take him to movies (just him and I even, likewise with his siblings - we have time just for each of us). So we’re at a good place this afternoon.

Edit 2: I’m going to answer a few questions here that were asked of me:

- I didn’t get a flip phone because (1) Walmart was out at the moment and (2) I wanted to see if I could trust him and I ‘want’ to trust him with a smart phone. The burner phone was only $30.

- He didn’t have the phone for the last 3 hours of our drive yesterday which meant he had no entertainment except the music I was playing and having the option of conversing with me which apparently is awful.... /s

- I want to be able to communicate with not only him but his siblings if they need to talk to me or vice verse which is why he is required to keep his phone unlocked. I even instructed him that if they wanted to call and text me he had to allow them to, but that was the only reason they get to use his phone. Not for games and etc. So there’s no real risk of privacy issues considering his siblings don’t get to use his phone as a “smart phone”. And not just in an emergency, I want them all to be able to reach me at anytime.

- I want to reiterate he currently has no social media other than the Reddit on his phone. He talks to his friends thru Fortnite mainly.

Edit 3: Well we just got home finally. I only answered questions/comments on my bathroom break stops. Also Atlanta’s road construction delayed my drive by 2 hours, eff that city.

I want to thank everyone for their opinions, comments and advice. There was some really great stuff there and it gave me a lot of perspectives. I sought out AITA on Father’s Day with this issue because I wanted some perspectives outside of my “bubble”. Everyone had a great opinion to contribute... except for that one guy.

c19umz	2019-06-16 13:24:30	Throwmeout_111	WIBTA for requesting a refund for a product 4 months after buying it?	"I know the title seems obvious but let me explain this situation. 

So I'm into cars and as car guys do, they buy expensive things. I purchased a set of custom made headlights with all the works. Custom halos and strips, all controlled by my phone and such. 

I've been having issues with controllers (the box that allows me to control the LEDs with my cell phone), and I'm now on my third one from this guy. He's been incredibly difficult with me from the very beginning, expecting me to just not really care that they're not perfect (mind you I spent 4 figures on these).

Whenever I've had to have him send me a new controller, he's never given me a label to ship back the defective one and claims, 'I can't return' these headlights, because they're custom made. He never told me this until *after* I had already purchased them and they showed up at my door. He also doesn't make any warranty claim anywhere when talking to him. Sounds like a lot of red flags I know, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad.

I made the purchase through PayPal roughly four months ago, and all contact was done through him on Facebook. The main reason I want to return them now is the headlight housing is starting to spider web on the inside of the plastic, making it look really bad. I've consulted other makers of custom headlights about this and they say it's usually a combination of heat with aftermarket lights, vs OEM lights. This is why you don't typically hear about this issue with headlights. 

Now, I get it. OP, why are you complaining about some small cracks inside the headlight? It's not that big of a deal right? Sure, it might not be to some, but I'm always taking pictures of this car and taking it car meets/shows and seeing cracks throughout the front show piece doesn't look very good.

I don't even know if PayPal is willing to accept a return/refund of the product. The guy has been very difficult with me ever since I actually paid him and it's really frustrating.

I've been questioning myself about this problem ever since I started having issues with them, and I feel that he's guilt tripping me trying to get me to stick with them. He's told me that he uses the money that I give him to purchase parts for the build so I'd essentially be screwing him over entirely. He'd be out all the money and would get back the product as is, assuming PayPal would even return the money.

So my question is, WIBTA if I tried to get this refunded through PayPal after all this time? If this isn't the right place to ask, please tell me.

Quick edit: the headlights were built by a single guy out of his garage. This isn't a big company I'm dealing with that can eat costs, so I'd be directly affecting his bottom line.

Edit: I should have also clarified I attempted to see if he was willing to return these headlights about 3 weeks after I installed them into the car when the first controller went bad. I did not go through PayPal at all and that's when he said he can't return them because they're custom."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c19tt5	2019-06-16 13:21:58	applepieguy9	WIBTA if I paid for my kids' college tuition with strings attached?	"My son and daughter have both graduated high school, and after taking some time off, they're looking at colleges to attend. I have a good chunk of cash saved up over the past 20+ years for their tuition. For the sake of simplicity, let's call it $100k total, $50k for each. However, I'm not going to just give it to them willy-nilly, this money comes with a few strings attached if they choose to accept it. Currently, my kids do not know of this money or what I've got planned for them.

The plan is this: **I will pay for their tuition and room/board as long as they keep their grades up, stay out of trouble, and follow these rules:**

1. Grades must be consistently high, A's and B's only. An occasional C is fine, but repeat C's from class to class, semester to semester is not.
2. They will be required to *physically* show me their grades twice per semester: Once after midterms, once after finals. No showing me over FaceTime or over a screen-share. They must physically come to me, log into their account and show me in person.
3. If they choose to pursue a liberal arts degree, then I will give them *half* of what I've got saved for each of them. They will have to pay any extra amount themselves.
4. No out-of-state schools (unless it's Ivy League).

I will directly deposit this money into their school accounts each semester as long as they don't deviate from the guidelines. If they do not keep up their grades or fail to show me them, then their funding will be cut off *immediately*. No funny business, no excuses. If there is any amount left over after this money is spent, they will have to pay the rest themselves.

**For rule #3:** The entire point of attending higher education is to obtain a degree/set of skills that they can use to start a lucrative career. Anyone will have a better chance of landing a great job sooner with an education in marketing/technology/economics/trades than with an education in theatre/art/gender studies/etc.

**For rule #4:** Out-of-state is *wildly expensive* compared to in-state. The only reason I could justify paying out-of-state is if they get accepted into Harvard, Stanford, or something else.

My wife thinks I'm being a little too strict with the rules around this money, particularly with rule #3 and #4. She believes we should just give it to them regardless of what they want to do or where they want to go and support them 100%.

c19sxb	2019-06-16 13:19:11		WIBTA if I deleted FB Messenger to avoid my dad?	"My dad will not do anything for himself. The factory he worked at closed down and my mom divorced him. It was then that he started saying that he was poor and unable to do anything for himself. He has my elderly grandparents bringing him groceries each week. My brothers tried to help him find a job, he quit them all and settled on a Walmart job. They don’t give him 40 hours a week and they pay very little. He doesn’t like to drive, he expects others to cater him around on his terms. He only eats microwavable meals and sits at home all day, every day. His excuse for not doing anything is that he is too poor. 

I am a receptionist at an auto shop, my dad drives a crappy old car. I cannot go on Facebook without him contacting me on messenger to ask for favors. Right now he wants me to call him a tow truck and have the car brought to my shop for a blown brake line. He wants me to drive him to and from work until it is fixed. I work first shift, he works second. I have to wake up in the middle of the night to pick him up. All of these are demands, no one ever has a choice. He will not borrow my car in the meantime, he will not call for a tow truck himself, he will not do anything for himself. Everything has to be on his terms.

He wants me to stop at his house regularly to check the oil in his car. There’s a list of other crap, he will not do any of it for himself. Even if I write out step-by-step instructions and show him how to do it he refuses. The world needs to wipe his ass or else. I am tired, I have other things to do, I have a family of my own at home. If I say no to the man I will be seen as a monster to my entire extended family yet I’m doing the most for him. They won’t step up. The man is giving me an ulcer. I want him to just call the office like every other customer and make an appointment if he needs his car fixed. I shouldn’t have to work off the clock. That is why I want to delete my Facebook messenger. It is the only way he contacts me and I want to take that away from him. No more Facebook messenger, he can either publicly post to my wall that he is a complete invalid or he can call me at home where I will be ignoring him. Basically I want to force him to call the auto shop if he needs work done on his vehicle. I want to force him to do something for himself. WIBTA if I did this? 

I would like to add that I found out that he is NOT poor. The last time I had work done on his car he wanted me to help pay and said that all he has is 18k in the bank and he doesn’t want to spend it. I was fucking livid. I know what being poor is like and 18 grand in savings is not it."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c19q31	2019-06-16 13:10:35		WIBTA to tell my mother in law no when she invites herself to when my husband and I go visit my family?	"My husband and I have been together 7 years, married for 2 of them. In the beginning we lived with his parents. We currently live 1 mile away in the same neighborhood. It’s a very Everyone Loves Raymond situation over here. 

If it was up to my in laws we would spend every weekend with them. I’ve put in some boundaries and we see them about once a month. This month we actually saw them a lot (we traveled two different weekends with them and spent yesterday brunch together and will spend all day today with them for Father’s Day) They also post all of this over social media so to my family they see all the good times we have with the in laws. 

My family lives 2 hours drive away. My mom has expressed disappointment she doesn’t get to spend as much time with us as the in laws do. After our wedding we started doing monthly dinner clubs with my family where we pick a middle place and try out new restaurants. This is our standing time with my family. It’s been really great because my DH is getting to know his in laws and the burden of driving far is off him. These dinners are also short never more than 2 hours so perfect boundaries. 

The problem- lately my MIL has been asking if she could come to our next monthly meet up with my family. She asked this yesterday in front of the whole in law family. I can tell it’s bothering her because everyone got quiet when she said it. I just changed the subject but I want to tell her I think it would offend my mother.  We literally saw them 3 of the four weekends this month and she wants to invite herself to our next monthly dinner with my family. 

In private in the past I’ve suggested to my mil that she could reach out and set up a different activity to get to know my family but she hasn’t done so. Also my family has invited her and their whole family each year they do an Easter brunch (my in laws came two separate years) but I mentioned that to her as a “they’ve extended invites” and you guys haven’t at all to help her connect the dots that inviting herself is rude but I never spelled it out. 

I feel like that’s more than enough on my family’s part and her inviting herself to our monthly dinners is not coming from a good place of getting to know my family but rather interjecting herself because she’s jealous of their time with us. 

ATIA for feeling this way? WIBTA if I explain this to my MIL that I’m worried it would offend my mom? 

I have a decent relationship with my mil and feel like if I explain this she might understand? She’s also told me early on that she had a bad relationship with her own mil and I should always feel comfortable telling her if something bothers me.

c19ps0	2019-06-16 13:09:39	overfamily1000000	AITA for putting strict conditions on my brother moving in with me?	"This is a throwaway because my brother is on reddit, I’m a guy. First, some background:

My older brother has issues gambling. In the past my parents have had to pay his rent, and 2 months ago I had to give him money for a car payment because he’d fallen too far behind. We’ve never had the best relationship, but I’ve got a good job and so does my husband. We’ve just built a 2-bedroom “pool house” (basically a granny flat next to our pool). 

My brother recently lost his job because he kept going to the pub at lunch and playing the poker machines. I think he is an addict but my parents and him refuse to believe it. He didn’t tell anyone he’d lost his job, only when he got notice he was being evicted for not paying rent. My parents can’t afford to bail him out again, and I don’t particularly want to because I know in the long run he’ll do the same thing again. Now to the issue 

My parents suggested he move into the flat out the back of my house, which I do not really want. He has said very homophobic things to me in the past and my husband isn’t keen on him because of it. But, he is my brother, and so I said I would let him move in on the following conditions: 

1) you look for a job every day once you get one, you’ll be paying rent 
3) keep the flat clean 
4) you get my permission before anyone comes over 
5) you do not go to a pub or rsl and use poker machines, and you don’t use betting apps. 
6) you respect my husband and help him around the yard etc if he asks 

I was especially hard on the last 2 points. I said if he  so much as looks at a poker machine, he’s out of the flat. My brother got super annoyed about this, and my parents told me I wasn’t acting like a brother, and I should just let him move in until he “gets back on his feet”. It caused a big argument and now they aren’t speaking to me. 

So AITA? I want to help, but I feel like just bailing him out all the time and giving him shit for free isn’t helping

"I’m getting married in a few months and just sent the official invites out. We were trying to keep it to 150 guests attending, but ended up with over 200 on the invite list. That being said, I’m being a bit picky with who gets a plus one. Thus far, people who don’t have a significant other and would know other people at the wedding have not gotten a plus one. Aside from one “friend” who has a long-term BF (and I use the term friend loosely here).

I’ve known this girl my whole life as she is a good friend of my older sister. But I’ve always disliked her. She’s negative, rude, and the type of person who always has to “one up” everything you say. She has been in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend for ~7 years and they live together, but I’ve never even met him. And she cheats on him every chance she gets.

She has openly stated that she would “stop cheating if he finally proposed” and brags about her cheating, which is literally every weekend and with multiple guys. She cheated most often with another friend who is invited to the wedding - although complained that it has stopped since he got a girlfriend (and I gave him a plus one for her lol).

She complained to my sister recently about not receiving a plus one when the guy she cheated with did, and that it’s not fair. Honestly, if it wasn’t for my sister, I wouldn’t have even invited her to begin with. AITA for not giving her a plus one?

This is a hotly departed topic. Usually my answer is that as long as you check for a drink and do it slowly it’s fine, and my response to “it sucks to lose space” is “well, then they can recline theirs,” but the rear row can’t. However, I believe this specific rear row appears to have more room than us - meaning my reclining would put them with the same amount of room, not less than other people have.   

So, Reddit - AITA if I recline my seat? I’ll see you after the flight to find out!

Update: I should’ve said WIBTA...and according to half of you, I am! I reclined because the people behind me had more room (weird, I guess they gave next to bathroom seats a perk to make up for it,) didn’t have drinks, and weren’t tall. I honestly wanted an opinion on if this - with all of those things considered, which I always check for - would’ve been asshole behavior. Many mentioned these in their judgements as to why it’s an asshole move. I only agree in specific cases (a seat with a drink can be reclined okay as long as you check in, get the OK and do it gently) but I suppose an objective opinion is pretty elusive! Thanks everyone."

c19k9c	2019-06-16 12:52:18		AITA if I don't want my boyfriend to go on tour in another continent for 5 months?	"So my boyfriend just got back being a roadie for a relatively popular band across the country for 6 weeks. I had no issue with this at all due to it only being 6 weeks and thinking that this would be a once in a lifetime opportunity for him. 

&#x200B;

He recently just got back from this tour and had a great time! However, they asked him to join them on tour again next year for 5 months in another continent. My boyfriend knows that this coming year I'll be taking a gap year from my studies and we were planning on going to another continent together next year. We've never travelled that far before, making it a very exciting experience for the both of us!

&#x200B;

Also, I think 5 months is way too long spend apart. 6 weeks for me felt like a long time!

&#x200B;

Finally, he would have to quit his job now to go on this tour, leaving him with nothing when he's done. 

&#x200B;

I really don't want him to go on this 5 month tour. I feel selfish for not wanting him to do it because it really is a great opportunity but he knows that we were in the process of planning our trip next year, he won't be employed when the tour is done, and I don't think I could bear being away from him for 5 months.

The playlist grew slowly with more and more followers (currently has nearly 3000 followers) and I decided to make another playlist which is filled with indie songs (350 followers). I realised that people would probably want to hear songs they like on these playlists so I opened up requests. Most of the requests come from the artists but I don't mind because their music is usually good and underrated.

&#x200B;

**Problem:** Here is the problem. I  accepted someone's request without listening to their song beforehand (that was dumb of me). Their song was good but very different from the genre my smaller playlist is but it was my fault so I kept the song on the playlist. A few days after that, she asked me to put the song on top of my playlist so I told her that some users didn't like it **but** I felt like an asshole so I just replaced the song with another song she has because it was kinda slower? She was alright with it but after adding that song, I seem to be losing followers. *Looking back, I think she copy and pasted the request and just changed my name and playlist so it seems personal?*

c19hq2	2019-06-16 12:43:32	lejohanofNWC	AITA for telling my neighbors it was too late to be setting off fireworks?	"Hey /r/amitheasshole, long time first time.

My Mom (65) and I (25M) live in a house in a small quiet town. Last night at about 10:30 pm I was falling asleep when I suddenly hear a woman screaming bloody murder. Or so I thought, it was actually just a bottle rocket. It yanked me right out of that pre-sleep mind drifting kind of shit that happens. I lay there thinking about what to do, watching them walk in their yard using their phones as flashlights. I was hoping the bottle rocket was a one off and it pretty much was. They then began lighting off smaller, and relatively quieter fireworks. It was still loud and I was still angry that I had been woken up, and I was fairly certain my Mom had too.

It was a long week for me and my Mom, she had a lot of events at work and I worked somewhere close to 65 hours this week doing manual labor. Sunday is also my only day off so I was really hoping to get to bed early, sleep in a bit, and still be able to get some stuff done around the house. To top things off, this is the first Fathers Day without a Father for my family, he passed two months ago. I didn't expect people to be cognizant of it but that and it being the tenth anniversary of my friend drowning has made me more emotional than normal.

Anyway I put on some pants and stepped outside. Their plot is large and kind of wide so when I said ""Hey, it's kind of late to be setting off fireworks"" I half yelled it, like a 'come on fellas please' sort of yell. No one responded, I figured they didn't hear me. I walked over towards them and said the same thing in the same way, no response. I repeated the same steps as above and finally someone said ""We won't be setting anymore off"" I said ""Cool, thanks"" or something and began walking back inside. Someone said something about it being someones birthday but I didn't really answer because I was angry and just trying to get them stop lighting fireworks.

Was I being an asshole? Either way I'm dropping off a note today apologizing for being a grumpy old man of a 25 year old. I don't want bad blood between myself and the neighbors."	Not the A-hole	0	0	1233.0	53.0	0.0	0.0
c19cx7	2019-06-16 12:27:19	kirrenf	AITA for poor motivation?	"Dearest people of this subreddit, I made this account to post here after lurking for a long while.

This isn't really so much of something I did, and I'll just get to explaining why I'm even putting this here.

For the setting: I'm myself, 30 male, just got off work for my weekend from a 10 hour shift, off to get gas.

As I'm filling my car up, I heard someone say fairly loudly, ""Excuse me!"" and my mind immediately told me I was about to be yelled at for doing something wrong or perhaps I had offended someone, or maybe it was a choosing beggar looking for money.

Instead, it was someone on the other side of the pump, pretty apologetic for raising his voice, and as if he could read my mind, he started out saying that it was not about the money, and it was more about gas. He was out of gas, his clothes were shabby, after he got out of the car I saw he was missing at least one shoe (I couldn't see his other foot so I can't really say for sure if he had one there), stains on his shirt, pockets out-turned, you know how it goes. Car looked nice, though, since it had rained just the other day.

In essence, he was wanting some help with his gas situation. I told him it was no problem, he apologized, I got him gas. As time went on while the gas pump was automatically pumping gas in, I wondered just how much this was going to cost me. This is kind of the part where I started to doubt things.

The issue here isn't my actions, but the motivation for my actions. After focusing on how much it was costing me, I started to think that maybe I was doing this just because I wanted to get out of this situation. After all, a corrupt motivation would sully a good deed, if it was even a good deed.

I started to wonder if I was going to get mugged, which I knew rationally I probably wasn't going to in broad daylight (this is about 7:30 AM). I started to wonder about this guy's issues that he needed someone else to get gas. I started to wonder why I had to be the one to do it, and why I was singled out. Maybe I was an easy target or something. Maybe it was coincidence.

As I got back in my car, I started to think maybe he somehow got my card number with one of those readers some people can hide on pumps or ATMs. I've been constantly checking my bank account for strange purchase authorizations ever since then, and this has been on my mind for a while. So far, nothing, so maybe I'm just being paranoid. Heck, once he shook my hand my mind immediately turned to hand sanitizer, since I did not know where he had been, but it looked like he needed a bath.

I don't really go out of my way to help people, and now that I did help someone, I have a nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that it'll come back around and bite me. Instead of feeling good about this, I feel terrible and anxious. That's not what helping someone is about, though. It shouldn't be about worrying about money, and it shouldn't be about wanting to get away from this awkward situation.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks all for the reassurance. I think my line of work has made me a bit paranoid (one of those 3 letter agencies), and reading about all the crazy stuff on other subreddits probably fueled it a bit."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c19c0q	2019-06-16 12:24:21		AITA for not wanting to date this girl anymore because I found her with another guy right after I asked her out?	Recently, I asked out a girl (let's call her Cara) from one of my classes in college. We've been friends for about 6 months now. For some background, I'm a virgin and I've never had a girlfriend. When I asked her out, we agreed to go out for dinner and a movie on a Saturday night. The Friday before our scheduled date, we were both invited to a party at a friend's house. I'm not really into partying and drinking, but decided to go anyways. At the party, we both met a guy (we'll call him Conner). I didn't think much of him and decided to play cards with some of my friends. Later during the night, I was looking for one of my friends to give him back his phone that he dropped. I walked into one of the bedrooms and saw Cara giving Conner a blowjob. They both didn't see me because they were faced the other way. I quickly darted out of the room and soon left the party. I felt a little hurt about the whole thing, but that oh well, she can do whatever she wants with her body. The next day, Cara texted me confirming the time of the movie and dinner. I made an excuse and told her that I couldn't make it and told her I'd let her know an alternate time I'd be available. Tbh, I don't really want to date her anymore. Sex is something that I only want to have in a committed relationship and I prefer to date someone who shares those values. I don't I can have a relationship with someone with different values than me. I'm not sure how to tell her I'm not interested anymore. I know we were never exclusive, but my gut is telling me to move on. She owes me nothing, but at the same time, I don't owe her anything either. AITA?		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Tuesday night my dad disappeared and we couldn’t find him. He turned off his location services and checked into a hotel. My mom and I went searching for him - driving all over the state we live in and we didn’t find him. The next morning we wake up to a text basically saying “I tried. Please cremate me.” At this point he had turned on his location services back and we had the hotel and called them to do a wellness check. When he didn’t respond the hotel manager called the police. They found him unconscious and barely breathing from self inflicted wounds and taking like 3 bottles of pills + a bunch of pills. He was medflighted to a nearby hospital. He’s okay now but he was incubated for like 2 days and we had no idea if he would have brain damage or if he was okay. I came home from college for only a week and took off work. I’ve since had to extend it so I could be with him. It’s been a god awful long experience and I’ve been waking up at 6 am everyday to get to the hospital to see him. 

Anyways, today he is being transferred to the psychiatric unit of the hospital to be treated and such. My mom is the only one who can visit him after he gets moved and when I left last night me and my dad said our goodbyes because we thought he was being moved that night. She’s waking up at the crack of dawn to go see him. We don’t know if he will be moved within 10 minutes of her being at the hospital or if we will have hours. I’m emotionally and physically exhausted and my mom keeps telling me things like “it’s Father’s Day and he’s being committed don’t you think you should go?” I love my dad more than anything and this week has been truly exhausting.

c199cq	2019-06-16 12:14:21		AITA for cutting most contact with friends?	"So, context. I'm 16M, and finishing secondary school in favour of college in a week. Almost all of my friends are done their exams and thus I won't see them unless we make plans. The ones I will see are in for my Further Maths exams, of which I have two. 

I have had a pretty rough time recently; one of two close friends I had hung herself, for which the other blamed me and cut contact. A childhood cat of mine died from kidney cancer after being reduced to weakness. My parents got divorced and I moved away from my childhood home and a girl™. After I made a new group of friends, I fucked that up and we're not really close anymore. I suspect both of my parents are heavily depressed due to how they act. I don't see my Dad because I'm busy studying, he's going away a lot over the summer and he's been reduced from a childhood hero to a shell. My Grandmother now also has dementia, and that's fucking with me. I don't see my brother (who's the only person in my life I look up to) as much anymore either, since he's in the city working and only comes home some weekends. 

Perhaps that's all a pity party and it's not that bad. Anyways. 

I just posted on my social media that I'm going offline for a bit. The only way my friends can contact me is via my phone number, which I posted alongside it, saying it's only for an emergency and that if they do need my help I'm always there, just not for casual conversation for a while. I feel like I need a while to just be away from people and sort myself out, especially because when I get like this I usually tend to make real bad decisions, such as when I fucked up my new (ex) friend group. Except, I've had people message me telling me I'm an asshole for buggering off at the start of the summer, for losing snapchat streaks (of which, I think they're fucking mental) and a couple people who I'd shown interest in romantically are pissed at me. I don't really know how long I plan to be gone for, but right now it feels like I want a week to a month.

c1982x	2019-06-16 12:09:47	Katedognate	AITA for watching a WWE pay per view (Money in the Bank) on my phone while at a wedding that was meaningless to me?	"So this goes back almost a month now to May 19th but my wife and mom are still so furious with me that my wife may divorce me and my mom may take her side over it. I need some honest feedback to help me go forward. 

I'm a huge WWE fan and I pretty much get all the PPV. Money in the Bank, there was a ton I wanted to see but it also culminates several story lines into a ladder match that I really wanted to see. It was may 19th and I made it very clear I wanted to watch the event. On May 9th my wife announced that shed been invited to a coworkers wedding and I had to go with her (by a crazy coincidence that we didn't know until we got there, the grooms mom is my moms good friend). I assumed the wedding woukd be on Saturday so I agreed. Well Saturday the 18th came and went and it wasn't until the 19th when my wife was pissed I wasn't getting ready that I was like oh shit, I can't go because of rhe PPV. She got so mad at me so I relented and went. 

It was one of those events where there I didn't know a single person besides my wife and my mom and rhe groom was sort of a dick. So after he sort of blew me off when I tried to congratulate him I was like fuck this and I got out my phone, parked myself in the corner and bought the PPV. My wife and now mom kept trying to get me away and be social and finally I got pissed and told them both to leave me the fuck alone. 

Things honest to god haven't been the same since. She says I looked like such and asshole with my phone in my face in a semi-dark room while everyone else was having fun and dancing. My mom says her friends all noticed me and commented that I must have been autistic or retarded so she's massively embarrased. 

To me I had plans, I did my part to attend and when I didn't know anyone I made the best of a bad situation to do what I wanted anyways.

Was I the asshole?


edit: 

to address the common repeats:

1. No I don't do network, my wife would come unglued if I have 24/7 access to something she hates so much. I still do PPV even though its more expensive. 

2. Invitation was only 10 days in advance because the bride claims she just ""forgot"" to send our invitation and only realized at the last minute when ""we"" hadn't RSVP'd. That's the bride and my wife's story, believe it if you do or don't. 

3. Yes it was a crazy coincidence my mom was at the wedding. But since we got a late invite and I don't speak with my mom all that often I would have no way of knowing in advance. The bride is my wife's coworker, the groom's mom is my mom' friend from some charity they work on together. I'd never met any of them.

c197sa	2019-06-16 12:08:40	VeteRyan	AITA for not returning my gift to my dad, for my dad?	"Hi all,

First off, happy Fathers day to all Fathers out there. 

Along with a few other small things, I got my dad 2 pairs of flip-flops (sandals) for Fathers day (he asked for then, not sure why). 
I asked his shoe size before getting them, went and got them and gave them to him this morning. He tries them on, says they're nice but mentions that the flip-flops have some type of padding that make them feel small, and he wants them exchanged for the next size up. I give him the reciept, and tell him to work away. 

He asks where I got them and I tell him. The store isnt our most local, but it's only 15 minutes drive. He said he won't be going there and asks if I would change them for him. I said I won't be going there any time soon. He rolls his eyes but says okay. 

Next day, my aunt is visiting and he tells my aunt what I got him, but mentions they're too small. She asks him if I'm going to return them for him and my dad says no. She responds ""you would think he would amend his mistake"".

I don't know why they think I'm obliged to exchange the gift. to be fair, my dad is pretty Ill, but I work 5 days a week, both my dad and Aunt are unemployed so I don't think I'm in the wrong, but it seems to be 2v1 so maybe I'm biased? 

What do y'all think?

Apologies for typing, on mobile.

Edit: people asking about his illness, he has arthritis in his hands. He also has pains in his feel from time to time. He's not bedridden, but has a support glove when it's bad. He wears the glove maybe 3 times a week."	Not the A-hole	0	0	78.0	7.0	0.0	0.0

It's expected to be a large party, around 100+ people. Me and my GF were planning on going, but my GF asked me if she could bring her dog (who can not be left alone or she will destroy things). I told her it wouldn't be a good idea, but she asked me to ask my dad if it would be okay. I flat out refused which upset my GF. But, let me tell you why I refused. 

A little backstory, my dad recently adopted two Saint Bernards (sisters) that are aggressive towards other dogs. They already attacked 4 dogs that I know of that were family friend dogs, and my dad isn't doing anything about training them. He claims that ""they don't do anything if I'm there watching"", but from the stories I've heard that doesn't seem accurate. My dad is the type to expect that everything will work out in the end, no matter what happens. So if I had asked him if we could bring my GF's dog, I know he would have said yes.

So, the reason I told my GF no is because I really don't want to have to spend the entire evening keeping track of where the dogs are. I'd also really rather not deal with breaking up a dog fight between 3 large dogs, because I know the responsibility would fall on me. Plus, if that does happen, I feel it would cast a negative light on my dad since he's planning on having clients there too. My GF is still upset with me and doesn't accept my reasoning. AITA?"

c194yg	2019-06-16 11:58:27		AITA for asking for a raise?	I'm sorry for the post if this seems off, I'm on mobile. So, I've been with this company for close to a year. I had to take a 3 month hiatus because I fell asleep on the job 3 months after being hired because I was working 7 days a week almost 20 to 21 hours a day. At the time I had 2 jobs and the job I'm talking about gave me a lot of overtime when I started. Recently since I've been back (about 10 months), I have had a lot of personal issues have come up over the past couple of months. It's close to the year since the hiatus and I have days where I get here late due to my children having serious issues with my son almost going def and a situation with my daughter being 7 and something that a parent wouldn't want to ever hear happening with a babysitter and now needing emotional help.... yeah... I have always been the person to come in on days off, stay late and even if I get to work late (usually without any consequence) stay later to make up for time. I was involved with an incident where our work tools have gone missing. The coworkers in my department have been known in the facility to habitually leave tools behind, because we usually try to jump from project to project. But recently after after an audit, my boss has noticed a power tool (leaf blower) and multiple tools missing. Decided to have a meeting in our department and said to all of us that he was going to switch the password to our tool closet/office and we were not allowed to have it or enter unless he was there. And would leave us tools to finish our shift if need be. Everyone in our department has the password again minus myself and he does the checkout with me, leaving certain tools behind, etc. I explained to him theft is an issue I take highly due to my background with family in the military, law, and government. He says its unbiased but I know that issue hits home because we weren't raised to be thieves on any account because of the self shame it brings if caught. I want to quit my job because I've been offered better positions at different company's but my loyalty and pride keeps me here at this location. I genuinely enjoy what I do. Recently our department has dealt with numerous turnovers due to employees quitting and now I'm working everyday with overtime minus one to help out until the end of the month and I never show any reluctance to help out. Now after feeling extremely disrespected from the accusation and knowing I'm always the first to volunteer to help out, I want to be given compensation for the effort and loyalty I have given until this point. I am going to wait until the month ends before I give my ultimatum. Bring that I am always the first to help and I do hard, honest work when I'm there. I'm just tired of being the person to point a finger at since I had my slip up over a year ago! Am I the asshole to ask for a raise to stay at a job I'm slowly starting to hate because the turnover rate of new hires is so high I can't even take a comfortable day off anymore?

To briefly summarize, my sister has emotional issues (possible borderline personality) and my brother has a violent past (multiple arrests, tried to hit me with a car, etc). As a result, I have distanced myself from them - for my own mental health. My dad does not like this and has tried to push me closer to them. I have an 18 month old son, and just want to protect him from negativity. 

I should also add that my mom died when I was 18.

Anyway, back in January my dad was bringing up my brother again and wanted us to meet to go through the family things (dad is selling our childhood home). I told him, again, I can’t be in the same room as my brother. My husband - to protect me - told my dad if he is ever in the same room as my brother he will have a hard time not putting his hands on him. My dad then became enraged and told my husband to “shut the fuck up” (in front of my toddler son); and more screaming continued from my dad and stepmom.

Anyway, my dad finally apologized to my husband 4.5 months later (of course after me pushing him to apologize). My dad hasn’t asked to see his grandson, my son; and this is also his only true grandchild. He is raising my 10 year old step nephew with my step brother is an incompetent loser.

c193y1	2019-06-16 11:54:31	probsthrowaway27	AITA for revealing my history of abuse to family then cutting contact?	"So as the title says, I \[F18\] was abused as a child over a couple of years by a relative who was also a minor \[F22\]. I've never disclosed what happened to anyone other than therapists, as I was never really upset with my relative for what happened. I have, however, been filled with shame & fear over what happened, and have had some therapy to help me unpack what happened. The therapists generally agreed that the issue wasn't the relative, who was also a child when it all happened.

The bigger issue was my mum, who was very absent and extremely verbally abusive to me and my dad, very controlling and caused a lot of trauma. She's always made me feel trapped and afraid, forced to visit her even after my parents split up. According to the therapists, that created an environment that made me feel extremely unsafe, unable to trust either of my parents, which made the abuse all the more possible (it all happened at her house too). I've also never been very close to my three siblings, who are all older, in part due to the fallout from the abuse.

So in recent years I've become very distant from everyone except my dad (who also has some major issues but we won't go into that). Recently, I visited my mum, and received the typical treatment of shouting and physical threats (throwing stuff at the wall, saying she didn't care if I died etc). I decided that that was it, I was never going to come back.

My mum, however, has created a system where she exerts control over me through my siblings, who often call me and guilt me into going back to visit them (they all live close together apart from me). They did this pretty soon after the incident, trying to get me to forgive my mum and move on, keep rebuilding the relationship etc. I'm really bad at talking on the phone with them, particularly because of how my mum has always manipulated my words and shouted me down etc. I decided instead to, over a couple of weeks with help from therapists, write up all of my grievances towards my mum in a letter, including the abuse that happened but without naming my relative in it, instead saying it was someone ""close to the family"". I then sent this to siblings, saying I wouldn't be taking calls or meeting in person for a while, and that I would no longer be reaching out to my mum at all.

However, soon after I sent the letter, I received a call from one of my siblings, which I refused to answer. They then sent me a really angry text saying I had to speak to them about what happened, that I had made accusations and that I couldn't expect to not speak to my siblings about it, and ending with ""it's not something anyone will accept or take lightly"". The last bit sounded like they were denying it happened, but I might have misinterpreted.

c192he	2019-06-16 11:48:23	Bastet102	AITA for storming out of the clinic and ruining my mum’s appointment?	"So my mum and I both booked an appointment to the dentist yesterday. We were told to go there on a specific time and so I drive both of us to the clinic on time.

We enter and inform the receptionist that we have a an appointment on this time and she tells us to wait for a few minutes.

Now I don’t mind waiting if I know the waiting line is long. However we were told to be there on a specific time and we were. To make matters worse, a guy comes in and asks the receptionist to move up some woman’s (A relative I assume) appointment. I go to the receptionist to ask how much longer will we have to wait, as we have been waiting for more than half an hour.
She tells me there is one patient before us which I don’t mind. Then she suddenly changes her statement when the guy (that came in earlier) glares at her and tells me there are two patients before us.

I immediately realize what’s going and I get visibly annoyed. I tell the receptionist that I have so much stuff to do and I can’t afford to wait for hours for appointment that I was already on time for! 

She starts patronizing me and tells me that I don’t know how appointments work.
So I tell her that I’m canceling my appointment. By this point mum intrudes and says she has an appointment too, imploring me to stay. I tell her that she should stay for her appointment while I take care of some errands and that I will pick her up whenever she finishes.

She gets mad and she says she’s canceling too. So we go out and mum’s upset with me and the receptionist is glaring at me like I’m some disrespectful asshole.

So am I an asshole for expecting the bare minimum and the courtesy of having my appointment on time?

c19125	2019-06-16 11:42:48	IAmAllWrong7	AITA for being inspired by her writing style	"TW: brief drug use mentioned

My friend and me are both authors, we critique one another’s writing and learn a lot from one another. I taught her about improving on her description and she taught me about improving on my dialogue.  

Fast forward to recently, there was a horrible book we both loved that was erased from the internet so I took it upon myself to recreate the book as a laugh-I kept to the same themes of the deleted books, and wrote it as best I could from memory as a gift to my friend. 

Cue her saying I was mocking her writing style (in particular I copied ‘typos’, which were down to autocorrect) as before writing a chapter I read some of her work, so I guess I was subconsciously inspired by it (even though it was heavily descriptive based, which is more my territory than hers). And I told her honestly ‘I did read your work before I wrote my chapter, I guess I was inspired, but it was tone deaf include a hint of her phenomenal work in a mocking story’. 

She also claimed I mocked an old character of hers, when in my mind I just mocked the character from the deleted book (they both shared histrionic traits). And she claimed I copied describing the rush of opiates from her when I’ve done opiates and used my own experience-there’s very limited ways to describe it apart from warm, itchy and tranquil. I stood by that I couldn’t copy getting high from her, it’s not as if she invented it. 

She didn’t believe me and is pissed with me for ‘mocking’ her when I didn’t. All I can honestly admit to is being subconsciously inspired by her writing and using it in a tone deaf way (I wouldn’t be happy if she used my writing style in a mocking story), but I told her I didn’t mean to hurt her and that I was sorry. She’s still being distant and has gone out of her way to be mocking towards me no matter how many times I tell her I didn’t mock her. 

She’s acting very petty, and refuses to listen to me when I say I wasn’t mocking her. She’s calling my stories dumb and insinuating I’m a fake person, as well as being very snide about things when in my mind I made her a gift she loved at first but now suddenly hates-which proves to me it’s her who’s in the wrong because she’s just suddenly flipped out about the story.

My best friend of about 3 or 4 years wanted a group of our friends to go out to dinner with us before prom. There was about 8 people total. However, when we were going to head out to diner, neither of us knew where the place was. We had little to no reception due to the place being in the middle of nowhere. This makes us eventually miss a turn and neither of us knew it. By the time we got there, we were about 30 minutes late. Prom started at 8, and we got there at about 7. However, we didn’t know that everyone was waiting on us. 

Personally, I don’t feel they had to wait for us. They knew we missed a turn and knew we’d be a while. 

Then eventually, when we got to diner, my previously mentioned best friend threw remarks at us the entire night. And when I mean entire, I mean every time we saw her. Which was almost anytime we weren’t driving. 

After diner we went to prom, and we actually got their on time this go.

Then, while at the proms dance someone issued a threat to the place where we held prom. Some girl didn’t suck some guys dick(relevant, later) so he called the place that the dance was, and put in an anonymous threat. Because of that, we had to evacuate the place and move to our school. 

Now at our school, we got there and our friend was in tears. The girl who didn’t give some guy a blowjob, just randomly came up and told my best friend the reason why it was moved, because she didn’t give him a bj. This put her in a terrible mood, even worse than it was. She was crying, all while yelling at us about how we were late. She cried about how she spent 500 dollars on her dress, and more on her hair and makeup. And it was all ruined. Eventually she left the prom. 

Now it’s the morning after. I want to apologize for everything. I want to apologize for being late and screwing up directions, i want apologize over the threat, I want to apologize for everything that wasn’t necessarily my fault. But it’s not my fault. And I don’t know if I should apologize for it. I understand her frustration, but I don’t feel like the rude comments and remarks all night we’re necessary.

just some backstory, im currently staying with my parents for a few weeks and my mom is a heavy smoker. shes smoked since she was a teenager and shes never quit for longer than a few months, not even when she was pregnant with me or my other siblings.

i dont have any official diagnoses, however her smoking makes me incredibly sick. anyones smoking does. the second i smell it i get extremely nauseous, dizzy, and lose whatever appetite i have. especially in cars because i already tend to get slightly carsick alone. because of this, i try to ask people to not smoke around me. most people normally are ok with this, however ive been just thinking about lying about having asthma, especially to my mom. 

ive asked my mom multiple times to not smoke around me. at first it was nicely asking ""hey, your smoking really makes me sick, could you please refrain from doing that around me"" but now i just flat out tell her that shes making me sick and she needs to stop, which she doesnt of course. every time ive told her, nice or not,  she just respond with ""oh well/ sucks to be you/ i think youre faking it"" its gotten to the point where i cant even enjoy going out with her anymore because by the time we get to wherever we're going i feel too sick to even do anything.

im thinking about just pretending im going to the doctors and telling her that i have asthma in an attempt to get her (and anyone else who refuses to not smoke around me) to just stop doing it near me.

We helped each other to get trough the rough part of life and then quite soon I moved out and later did he.This was 5 years ago and today we both have our own places and live a nice life. 

We used to be in contact  early every day until he got into a relationship. He stopped contacting me, never had time to hang out and I was a bit sad but also happy for him. I totally that once you find a partner you just click with your priorities can change. But then later I realized a pattern in the way he contacted me. It was always out of the blue and 90% of the time he needed help with something. I helped but on the other hand he used to help me too like a month ago my whole account got frozen because of a bank teller’s mistake and even tough I was told they will fix it in 24 hours he helped me pay for a package that was arriving the same day. I’m really grateful for that and just last week I spent 2 days working on his CV for him as he needed help with it because he wants to change jobs. 

Also he lives in a few kilometers out of the city I live in. So today he called me he’s cutting down some trees with his other friend and that he needs my help.

I'm part of a playgroup. Every Tuesday and Friday we meet up and play games. Recently a newer couple has come along. They're both in their late twenties. I'm getting along with them reasonably well, but they're a lot more extroverted than I am. One of the people I've known for a seriously long time got along with them. He has been inviting his girlfriend over and now they're playing against each other.
This resulted in me feeling sort of ignored, but okay. I'll play with other people. No biggie.

A few weeks ago there was a small festival in our city and I heard my friend, his girlfriend and this couple talk about going. I asked if I could come along and they agreed. So I canceled some other plans. We didn't agree on a time or place. We just agreed to go together.
On the day of the festival I hear nothing. I decide to go alone. Luckily I didn't run into them (that would've been seriously awkward) , but they still went as I saw the next day.

I am single by the way. This could be related to this issue, but I don't mind hanging out with couples at all.

We didn't go to any family events for a couple of years, but for the last 6 years, my mum has been really angry with me that I refuse to go to any event he is at.

c18w8s	2019-06-16 11:23:50	Torbbytorb	AITA for being mad that my friend has my pictures in his Grindr profile?	"My best friend is gay, I'm not. We live together and I don't care that he's gay, it rarely impacts our life.

Last month we were talking and somehow the subject of Grindr came up and he brought up how they show the distance all their users are from each other. I said that's super creepy and asked to see how it works, he backed out of a profile showing the distance and I saw myself in his profile pic. It was a photo we took together while at a convention with an impressive cosplay. I asked about it and it was, admittedly, a great photo and shrugged it off.

Then he has 2 more of us, one hiking and one at the beach. I remember the beach one and it was cropped to just show us on the right with our other friends on the left, so if he knows how to crop, why leave me in?

He said a lot of guys talk to him initially thinking it's me or ask about me when they come over. I was pissed. Dozens of ""friends"" he brought over have hit on me and suddenly it made sense.

I told him to delete them immediately, but says he gets a lot of attention with it and I'm not on Grindr, so why should I care? This is conceded no matter how I say it, but I'm significantly better looking than my friend.

He pays for the full rent online and I give him money for my half because it's easier. I've withheld rent from him this month until he deletes them. We both have great jobs and well off families so it's not hurting him *that* much, but it's 500\~ out of his pocket regardless.

I feel like he's causing unwanted attention towards me and the idea of them talking about me on Grindr makes me very uncomfortable in and of itself.

Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are commenting ESH/ITA because I withheld rent. While also saying they can see why I did it or understand why. To me, that seems like you can see the justification. I thought that would be a little overboard, but he can get his money back immediately if/when he deletes the photos. So it's up to him if he wants his money back.

c18vct	2019-06-16 11:20:05	KarlHungusWonAnOscar	AITA for dicking around this company during recruitment?	"Aight big guy's and girls let me know-  


12 months ago I was looking for work and was moving through the recruitment process with a large recruitment mob in a big city. These guys were top of their field, internationally renowned and fiercely competitive at what they do. A good company to have on the CV, but absolute ball breakers to work for by reputation.   


So I got the job and was due to start within two weeks. They were stoked to offer it to me, and actually invited me out to work drinks prior to my commencement. The boss in particular had decided that we were really similar people and wanted to hang out. He didn't seem like a bad dude, just intense and driven (like most there).   


Within those two weeks, I was offered a far better job. Extra $35k annually, more interesting work, flexible working conditions. Only issue was that they dragged their feet offering me the contract. They weren't playing any tricks, HR was just on a holiday, but it meant they delayed sending me the contract and so I couldn't flat out refuse the recruitment gig before my due day to start.  


That day rolls around. I'm up early deciding what the fuck I should do. At 7:30am, I call in sick. They buy it, and say can't wait to see you tomorrow. At 9am, I get the contract from the better offer. 9:30am, I reject the recruitment company's offer, and try to politely say why I did what I did, and that I wish them all the best (truly I did).  


That boss who seemed like he wanted to be besties sent me the rudest email in the northern or southern hemispheres. He called me unprofessional, a user and a manipulator.   
I felt pretty gutted. I didn't hate the guy, and I felt I had been backed into a corner by the situation.   
So I've been with the other job for a year now and love it, but this still bugs me.   


So lay it on me homeslice's. AITA? I am curious to see what the interwebs has to say.   


TLDR: I accepted a job offer, then had a better one before I was due to start. I took the better one, but due to the short time around was insulted by the first company."	Not the A-hole	0	0	6.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
c18toi	2019-06-16 11:13:18	canwritebutnotedit	AITA for not seeing my best friend because I didn’t want to argue with SO about what time to leave?	"My best friend from childhood (E) asked my SO and I to hang out yesterday. My SO is also her friend from high school.

I worked 9 hours yesterday and both SO and I work today (short shift, but still need *some* sleep.) It’s also just been a rough couple past days at work. So, I really wanted to see E and have fun- but definitely didn’t want to stay too late. Like midnight or 1am at the latest. E understood and was fine with this.

But my SO wanted to stay out later. More like 4 am. We’ve had this argument before and it’s never pretty. It’s really the only thing we ever argue about. 

I’m so drained and just did not even want to risk an argument.

I told my SO that E invited us out, said I didn’t want to stay late, he asked “how late? Like 4?” And I saw our future later, arguing about what time to leave and just said “It’s fine, I won’t go.” He said “We can leave earlier, do you want to go?” I said “Yeah, but I don’t want to stay late, so I’ll just stay home.” He said again we could leave earlier than 4, but I know not to buy it. He’ll say it’s fine now, but later when I want to leave, he’ll be mad. This situation has been reoccurring for like the last 5-6 years, I know the dance. And was in no mood for it.

So, yeah. I feel bad for E though. She wanted to see both of us. I wanted to see her too. I wonder if I should have dealt with the argument for her sake. I actually stay home a lot just to avoid this argument. Otherwise I’ll force myself to stay out way later than I want to. Those are the two options, so I frequently pick the former.

Btw, we only have one car that will make it out of town, so separate cars doesn’t work. Also, E says the drive to our place is too far, so won’t come over, so that doesn’t work either. I’m shitty at arguing, so never win and get to leave early- well one time I did, but it was our biggest fight ever, no thanks for a repeat on that. And I can’t think of any other way around this.

c18qxv	2019-06-16 11:02:03	blahhnhhh	WIBTA: If I asked my family to stop bringing up having children?	My husband and I have been married for almost ten years. We have always been a little back and forth on the topic of having children. Neither of us is more for it or against it, we both are more or less just in the middle at this point. In the past we were more convinced that we needed to have children, I think mostly due to family and societal pressure that was put on us. During the course of our marriage I have had multiple miscarriages. We have spent a whopping $16,000 on fertility treatments and have had no luck in any of this. We talked about adoption, and we made the mistake of sharing this consideration with our families. Since then they basically want to talk nonstop about adoption. They bug me constantly about looking for loans and different agencies and throwing baby showers and everything else they can possibly think of. The thing is is that adoption is CRAZY expensive and we don’t have that kind of money right now, and not only that but this was a consideration for us, not a definitive decision. It’s come to the point that they bring something up everyday now about adoption. They look up tax refunds, contests for loan payments, and basically any sort of thing they can find. I don’t want to sound like an ungrateful turd. I know that they want me to be happy and that this is what they consider helpful. But it isn’t helpful to me, if anything it’s hurtful in reminding me everyday that I HAVE to make some sort of decision that I’m not ready to make. I’ve tried expressing it to them multiple times but they don’t see to get it. I’ve been straightforward and blunt and have even said that we’re saving for vacations and that we are NOT going to have children. Yet everyday I get another message about a radio show that will find your adoption. WIBTA if I asked them to leave me alone about it and stop bringing up children anymore?

c18q2a	2019-06-16 10:58:27	HollowPuppet3106	AITA for being upset over the distrust of my friend/Ex gf	"Warning: this situation gets a little complicated. I apologize in advance if this gets too long.

So last year, the day b4 my birthday, I met this girl who was a freshman at the university I attend (I was a sophomore). After hanging out a few times, I asked her out, and she reluctantly agreed. She has commitment issues, so she wanted our relationship to be open. I agreed, despite not really being comfortable with that. Dumb I know, but hell I didn't care.

Fast forward a few weeks, she's getting multiple sexts from guys, and has done stuff with some. I'm not doing anything. I then learn that one of her best friends from her hometown doesn't like me. It's purely because I'm dating her. He had a thing for her, and they slept together numerous times b4 we met. Eventually, she had to go back home for something, and I was terrified that she would see him.

When she left however, something happened. Her best friend, a girl who lives down the hall from her, came over to my dorm to help me study for a Japanese quiz I had. That night, I slept with her. Both of us thought she wouldn't care, and just did it. Feeling awful, I told my gf what happened and promised for it not to happen again as soon as she got back. Needless to say she was upset, but got over it.

Me and her broke up a few months ago, but are still fairly close friends. In fact, at one point, me, her, and her female best friend were able to get along. However, she began to bring up the guy back home multiple times, expressing how sorry she was for breaking his heart by telling him we were dating. She even told me multiple times that she wants to sleep with him, and she even calls him Daddy. That honestly broke me. I still, to this day, want to be with her. But everytime she brings him up, I get upset. There are reasons for this, but I'd rather not get into it. One of the main reasons, however, is that I still want to be with her.

A few months ago though, a week b4 spring break, her friend helped me dye the tips of my hair red. Her and I talked, I told her all the problems me and my ex we having. She was very understanding, and gave me good advice. Then, for the first time in my life (NO JOKE!), I broke a promise. I slept with her again.

Now, my ex and I get into arguments over the same thing. She constantly says that she can no longer trust me, because I broke my promise. Then she gets upset when I get upset whenever she brings up her friend back home and says she wants to sleep with him whenever we're on the phone. I no longer talk to her best friend and have apologized and made attempts to fix things multiple times. I really have no clue what I should do at this point.

I was due to get married and my best man and brother arranged my bucks party (Called a bucks in Australia). 

The day consisted of paint ball in day, meeting at my brothers house in the evening for pre-drinks and then heading out for dinner and drinks.

The morning went off with out a hitch. Everyone had a great time at paintball. Once paintball finished we all went home and arranged to meet at my brother's house. 

The evening comes around and we all meet and start drinking. Everything is all good. The standard thing happens where a stripper is arranged without ny knowledge and she does a show. At this point in time no one has any issues or makes any complaints. 

Following this we go into the city and have a nice dinner and decide to go out drinking. We went to one venue and everyone seemed like they were semi enjoying it but the group decides they want a switch. 

A strip joint gets bought up. I agree and it seems like everyone does. Anyway. We walk to this place and line up. I go in to find 6 of my mates from school aren't coming in (including my best man). They lined up behind me and when I went in they left the line. 

They went across the road with out telling me to a bar and when I text them say they are not coming in. They say that they don't agree with strippers and are not interested. We in turn have a disagreement and it seems like I am the arsehole for getting annoyed they don't want to hang out with me on my bucks. In the end I didn't seem the again for the rest of the night.

I advertised my old Canon 550D + 18-55mm kit lens for £189 on a local selling website. This includes a camera bag, remote and SD card.    

A man contacts me saying he’s willing to buy it but can only pay £100 now and will pay the £89 balance on payday.   

I agreed since he said he’ll leave his passport and driving licence with me.   

Then he didn’t come to pick it up when he said he would. 

After messaging him to see if he wanted it, the next day he responds that he does and that he’ll collect at 7pm. And that he would like two extra lenses that I was also selling. 

7pm comes and he doesn’t come. 

He messages again on Saturday that he’ll definitely come and pick it up. Which he actually does! 

I show him the camera gear and give him the opportunity to inspect it and take photos etc. 

I also showed him the two lenses that I had but state that I can’t give them to him since he’s not paying full price right now but that if I still have them when he comes to pay the balance for the rest of the camera then they’re his! 

Later on Saturday he messages me again saying that the rubber boundary on the view finder is missing. I apologised and said I hadn’t noticed and offered a FULL refund! He lives up the road from me, so I offered to come and pick it up. He declined and said that he’d still like the camera! 

He messages me Sunday morning that he’s “loving the camera” but would really like one of the lenses that I’m selling since it would be better for portraits. I guess his wife is an instagrammer or something. 

I said he can have them but he’d have to pay more later since I’m losing the opportunity of selling to someone who has the cash now. He declined saying he doesn’t have the money!

Then 10 mins later texts me saying he’s unhappy with the camera that it’s dirty etc.  

This time I offer a partial refund, since I know he’s used it and also because he’s annoying me! 

I stated that I’d given him the opportunity to inspect it and that I’m not a manufacturer or reselling business. Plus I didn’t make any false claims regarding the condition of the camera and stated that it was used! 

To hire camera gear for 24 hours can be £65+ so I figured giving him £50 back was pretty fair. 

He said he’ll hold onto it and pay the full balance on payday, but he thinks I’m being unfair. 

One of my friends also said that only giving half back was also unfair. So now I don’t know?

TLDR:  I sold a guy a camera, he paid £100 upfront and the rest later. He seemed to have no issues but now he’s demanded a refund after using it but I only offered £50 back, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	90.0	10.0	0.0	0.0

When we were discussing plans for our bachelor/bachelorette plans the idea of strippers came up multiple times. He wanted to know how I felt about him going to a strip club and to be honest I flip flopped a bunch. Some days I would tell him I didn't mind and other days I would say I wasn't comfortable with it.  Fast forward to a few weeks before we went to our respective parties and I made a final decision that I wasn't comfortable with it and my SO said he'd respect my wishes.

Fast Forward again and we're now at our parties. My party was basically a house party while his was ""out on the town"".

My party eventually started getting lame and turning into us just sitting around a living room chatting when one of my friends started insisting we hire some male strippers. After some back and forth with them I made it clear that I  was ADAMANT that strippers were not okay. I explained to them that my SO and I came to an agreement (which I now realize it wasn't so much an agreement as much as it was him waiting for me to form a concrete feeling/opinion on the subject) that neither of us would have strippers. One of my friends said that I should ""still hire some strippers"" since my SO was ""probably going to go to a strip club anyways.' I explained to her that My SO ""would never do that to me"" and she dropped it. We spent the rest of the night just chatting and hanging out around the living room.

My SO called me the next morning (we were in different towns) and admitted that he ended up going to a strip club at the end of the night. I immediately got very angry and told him that he broke my trust. He said his friends pressured him into it since the night ""started to get boring"" and he was ""only trying to be a good host."" He tells me that he never got a lap dance, ""only his friends did"" and I can ""ask his friends for proof""

Every 2 weeks we host friends at ours and Dan comes from a while away so he stays with us. Often times, my wife's friend who's a female will ask to stay with my wife as we only have one bedroom and me and Dan share the sofa. I don't mind this cause the alternative is wife's friend having to share a bed with Dan who she barely knows or driving 50+ miles home. 

Dan was with a woman called Julie who was lovely and we were introduced a while back. 

This Friday Dan came for the usual drinks, games and banter and he asked to have a chat. He told me he and Julie split up. I asked why and he told me it was because he's gay and he can't lie to himself or Julie as it just wasn't fair. I told him I understand and that I'm here for him. 

Then 2 weeks passed and I felt super uncomfortable now with the thought of sharing a sofa/bed with him after this revalation. I texted Dan and said he is more than welcome to come, that were really looking forward to seeing him but that he will need to either book a taxi home or book a hotel to stay at. I explained that whilst he is still my good friend, I feel weird sharing a bed with him now I know he's gay, just as I wouldn't expect wife's female friend to sleep in bed with a guy. It's just boundaries, you know? 

He replied saying he wasn't going to come and hopes we have a good night. Wife asked where Dan is, I showed her the messages and she shouted at me and said I was acting like a cunt and an asshole and that she can't believe I'd be so insensitive. I told her that Dan is a good friend but would she like me sleeping in bed with a straight female friend? Anyway, she said that I was being an awful friend and that I've basically told Dan he's not welcome. She then called Dan and told him to come to ours and that if anyone would be sleeping in a hotel, it's me. She then told me to either apologise to Dan or stay away so I left. 

AITA for setting boundaries for our friendship? I still love Dan as a person and want to spend time with him, he's always welcome at my house.

Well He has a few hundred followers and I learned about the follow-unfollow tactic where you follow people in the hope they follow back. Well I suddenly realised he blocked me. 

When I confronted him via DM, he said it was because he had ""earned those followers"" and I was just coming along and stealing them. I told him if they didn't like my page they'd unfollow and I was getting followers from his page because I knew they liked memes.

Well he turned nasty. He starts saying that ""because of me you were accepted in our friend group where no-one wanted you"".

c18es7	2019-06-16 10:09:57		AITA For declining my dads fathers day request?	"Yesterday my dad asked us for a request to go on a bike ride with him for fathers day. Initially I was fine with this as his request but today I learned the ride would be a 42 mile trek that'd take the entire day. He rides often but the rest of our family is not accustomed to biking, nor do we have bikes as good as his. 

I have pretty terrible allergies this time of year even when taking medicine, it gets me pretty fucked up. Just an hour outside and I get to the point of runny noses, soar throats, coughing and headaches, we'd be biking through a particularly forested and blossoming part of the state I'm in and I told him that it'd probably really affect me by the end.

All these reasons aside, I still feel bad for declining, I know this isn't as severe as other things on this sub, but his past father's day requests were always a lot simpler and less time-consuming. I want to show my appreciation to my dad but also don't want to be uncomfortable and sniffling the entire day to show it.

c18dje	2019-06-16 10:04:26	jgridik	AITA for not wanting to speak or interact with my grandfather?	"Let's call him G. He cheated on my grandmother with a woman called M. After this was found out by my grandmother, they had a divorce, G took a bunch of stuff that he had no right to from their house, and didn't pay child support. My grandmother didn't press any of it in court because she didn't want anything else to do with him. So she had to work in a shitty call center all her life, and now receives barely any retirement money to get by. He then married M.

M was a wicked woman. She would torment my uncle and my mother all the time, berating them for the smallest things. She even locked my uncle in their basement for several hours once, he was like 9. She listened in on most phone calls my mom tried to have with my grandfather. When it was brought up to him by my mom, he believed none of it.
 
All this made G and M be excluded from family gathering and events for over 20 years. No one ever backed up his actions, not even his own brother. 

I believe it was last year that M passed away. Shortly after, my mother found out that G started seeing a friend of M's and eventually got married a few months later. During this period, G reached out to my uncle, now well into his 30s with a wife and two children. He said he wanted to reconnect or whatever. My uncle hesitated and told my mother. She became a whirlpool of emotions. She's happy for the possibility of having a dad again, pissed because the remembers what he's done, and hurt because he reached out to my uncle long before he tried contacting her. 

So G's been slowly creeping into their lives again, my mother and uncle both speak to him pretty frequently now. My grandmother is pretty pissed about this and said she'll stop going to family events if G starts going as well. My mother tries to get me to talk to him on the phone so I could get to know him, but I don't really want to.

I've been told about the shit G has done since I was really young, so I've grown thinking he's a huge jerk and have come to terms with never seeing or speaking to him in my life. This man is a complete stranger to me, and my opinion of him has already been set extremely low. I can't even think of him as my grandfather.

He sent me a text and tried calling me yesterday. I don't know how he got my number, but I don't want to talk to or have anything to do with him.

My upbringing placed lots of emphasis on being polite, saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ at every opportunity, and saying ‘could you..’ or ‘may I...’ with my requests. To me this is normal and everybody I know from my home does this.

My partner is not from my country, but their country does have striking parallels to ours (for clarity, I am from England and they are from Ireland). My partner very rarely reciprocates these polite sayings, instead just demanding I do x and y, very rarely without saying please or thank you.

Would I be the asshole if I ask my partner to talk a bit more politely? Sometimes I feel like they’re my boss (even my boss at my previous job was more polite). Obviously I don’t want to change my manners because I don’t think that is the way to go."	No A-holes here	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

c18bpz	2019-06-16 09:57:08		AITA for not taking my brother's online romance seriously?	"My (19m) younger brother turned 14 three months ago. He's obsessed with Fortnite and it's basically his only interest besides school and two friends. Couple of weeks ago, he told me quote-unquote ""don't tell Mom and Dad but I have a boyfriend"". At first I was pretty shocked until he explained this is some other kid who lives in Australia (we're in Europe). They play the game together, but just to be safe, I checked out the boy's streams and YouTube channel to confirm he's actually 14 years old.

While I believe it's a relatively harmless thing, I'm also not convinced this relationship is even remotely real. My brother's pretty emotional and I think he's misinterpreting a strong friendship and mutual interests as loving someone. He's always done this with girls, which has led to some heartbreak, and the focus on this boy is probably the product of some of his classmates saying they're bisexual, so that's the ""cool"" thing at the moment.

Basically I just don't want him to feel hurt, because as I've said, he tends to be overly sensitive about this stuff. So when he asked me if his relationship would work out, I told him it'd be better to lower his expectations and focus on the real life instead. He didn't really want to hear that, but I think it's better that he does? He shouldn't learn to extensively fret about every fleeting online friend.

"So for some context to make sense of the title I work in a hardware shop that can get stupidly busy especially in the summer time. I work equally on the normal checkouts where people just pay for their items and do normal shopping things, but other times I work on the information/returns/exchanges counter. 

At the information counter we can process normal transactions like any other register but when its busy I tend to send people to the regular checkouts to pay so I'm able to focus on finding another customer's receipt who says they bought the product 3 years ago for $5 or explaining to a confused elderly woman that no we dont sell kitchen utensils.

However, when it isnt busy at the information counter I will often call over customers to help out the regular checkouts with the amount of customers they need to deal with. One day when I did this I sent a woman away who just wanted to pay so that i would be able to get through my line of 15 people and at the end of the queue was another woman who just wanted to pay that I let pay since I wasnt busy.

"My cousin (husband and wife) dont eat onion and garlic. It is a personal choice not a religious one and they have no allergic reactions to onion and garlic, they just dont like the taste so prefer not to eat it.

However everyone else in our family loves onion and garlic. Out of the 10 people in our extended family, they are the only two that dont eat onion and garlic. 

Yesterday it was my husbands birthday party and there were 30 + people. We made all the food at home ( Indian food, 2 curries, rice, naan, dal etc) but due to the quantity I decided it wouldnt be feasible for me to make a separate dish for them. 

Also my husband really likes onion and garlic, as do everyone else plus its almost a staple ingredient in Indian curries, so I find it quite difficult to cook without it and get the proper flavours. 

So at the party the cousin and his wife barely touched the food and had mainly rice and naan. They didnt complain about anything but I noticed they didnt eat much either. 

My mother told me afterwards that I should have made something for them as they barely ate and as a host I should have been accommodating towards thier preferences.

My older brother(20) spends the night sometimes. My OB has been living with my grandfather while working a stucco company (extended family runs it). 

My cousin is a person I dont like and will be civil with, but dont talk to. She used to live with her junkie mom before living with my physically and emotionally abusive grandma. I know shes had a hard life but I dont see how it can excuse her.

Shes lived with us since my grandma died in March of this year. She is obese and still acts like an only child. She'll eat a lot, I'm not exaggerating, and be greedy with space and people's attention. When my OB comes over he plays video games with YB while the 4 of us chill. Sometimes my cousin will be weird (including being open about personal matters such as commenting on other people's personal info and her own) my brothers were in a small argument about a mess and she started talking about mean comments YB said a long time ago.

I got irritated because I saw it as her placing herself in their argument so she could win the attention and empathy of my OB and victimize herself. I mean my brother was like 10 when he said it and so he probably feels bad because shes open about her insecurities about being left out everytime we share a fond memory or inside joke(that also irritates me). She brings moods down all the time so people will pity her. I rant to my OB a lot and shes no excuse. So when I leave the room because I cant stand her and my brother gets mad and tells her I've been talking sh*t about her, aita?

c17vkj	2019-06-16 08:43:43	warmcube	AITA don't care about bro's stressful life	"Hi Reddit. 


I (31M) suffer with end stage renal failure. My kidneys filter around about 4ml of blood per minute. Side affects of this are chronic lethargy and just a general inability to do anything physically demanding. Consequently, I have to be a lazy bum not doing a lot, which I have been really struggling with. 


I recently had an operation to put a catheter into my peritoneal cavity and start dialysis. The operation is minor bit because it goes through my abdominal wall, recovery takes a few weeks. During this recovery time I have to attend hospital and the new tube that is poking out of my stomach is flushed through to be kept clean and make sure the cavity itself is healing correctly. 


I live in Spain but am from the UK. To help out, my mum flew over to stay with us when I came out of hospital. As a result of not realising how ill I have become, attending my hospital appointments with me to watch me get hooked up to a machine that fills the new tube sticking out of me with liquid my mum got quite upset. A few days later my mum flew home after I had started to be able to get around on my own a bit more. 


I have a brother. He's 29, married, has a 2yo, wife's pregnant, just bought his first house and got promoted. His life is going great. I text him to see if he was free to talk and he we had a few exchanges before he started to moan at me how stressful it was moving house and how him and his wife were going to have to spend the day cleaning their old house and how they were stressing. Now, in my current situation, I would cut off my hand to worry about these trivial things but my brother doesn't really know how ill I am, so I didn't say anything and just let him carry on and eventually just stopped texting him.


The next day I called my mum for a catch up. She was doing ok and she asked if I had spoken to my brother. I said yes but that I had lost interest when he started to moan about moving house...


Here is where I need your judgement Reddit...


My mum had a go at me and said I should give my brother a break. How he's under so much stress at the moment. I lost it. I shouted at my mum about how I would love to have his trivial problems. That I would love to be able to have stress at work and have only that to worry about. It upset me that my mum, who a week before was sat next to my hospital bed, was telling me to give my brother a break. I know she is our mother and loves is equally but I said to her I don't need you to tell me how hard my brother has it at the moment because he just doesn't. 


The call ended with my mum putting the phone down and saying she won't talk to me about my brother anymore because it obviously upsets me. 


Am I the asshole for not wanting to hear about how 'stressful' my brothers life is from my mum?

The person this is about is my ex's friend who he has known for years and she is a social worker. 

A year ago we had a contempt trial, against him for violations of our order, and he brought her (SW) as a witness. They introduced her as a social worker and then tried to introduce her ""experience"" as a SW. The judge Shut it down IMMEDIATELY as it was innapropriate.

I had several people advise me to report her then. I didn't. Imo, the judge would be the correct person to raise any concerns. 

Recently, she asked my ex to invite our son to her son's birthday party. This is the 3rd year the party is during my weekend, clearly aimed at causing drama. Each year the invites and response have gotten more aggressive. This year, my ex emailed me the invite and cc'd her work email. 

I responded factually/politely and declined the invite only to him (removed her as cc). For the following reasons:

1. If I take him he sees 4 adults aggressively go after me.
2. Ex won't return him on time or communicate.
3. Dropping him off means his father could take him and leave before I return. Which he has done before.

I chose the less suck situation out of all 4 suckage options. I dissapoint my child, as his father told him before I even knew he was invited, to prevent more confusion/ drama. It still sucks. 

She then responded separately (her personal email) where she states she would never allow drama at her son's party but I am selfish for punishing her son. I advised her that her behavior was innapropriate, especially considering her line of work. Her response was ""my work has nothing to do with you being a terrible mother"" and she Hope's my son ""sees me for what I am and hates me for it"".

My person, who is heavily embedded in the family court arena, advised me her behavior was so innapropriate, just the emails, that I should anonymously report her to her boss. She felt even more so after I advised her of the situation in court. 

My person's view is that If she (SW) can't step back from her personal opinion in our situation, she is a danger being a SW on other cases. Also, my person advised me that they never watch cases in court. Just sitting behind a client, their presence in the court room can sway the judge's opinion. She then stated this women's (SW) presence could do the same and there is no way she didn't know this.

I've always believed you don't screw with people's jobs.  Is this my place to report her or  WIBTA ?

TLDR: Social worker has tried to use her role to benefit her friend (my ex) in court. Professional friend of mine, and active member of family court arena, has advised me to report her to her boss for this as it's innapropriate. WIBTA if I do it?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	3.0	5.0	0.0	0.0

i was not informed of the price at all when i ordered it and i was not told i was buying the bottle. i told them all of this. they said that the bottle was already opened for me so i had to pay for it, then they said that they could charge me $60 for a ‘glass’ of the sake instead. by this time i was extremely upset and i didn’t even want to be there anymore. i paid the $60 and left trying not to cry but i’m still absolutely furious. am i a jerk for being upset or just an idiot? :/"		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

"I was feeling a bit off tonight, my boyfriend could tell, and I told him I was just having very bad anxiety. I get this sometimes. We are very open about our mental health with each other.

So I said I'm off to have a hot shower - I was feeling really awful and this usually helps. He suggested we ring up my friend and go have a hot spa with her instead. I said no, I didn't feel like going anywhere. 

He then proceeds to tell me he's going to go anyways. 

So I got upset and a little sulky. She's an awesome girl, but super flirtatious and says really inappropriate things. I mean graphic details of her sex life and the size of her breasts whilst feeling them and talking about it. She just really likes to be centre of attention. It makes me feel a bit uncomfortable when she discusses this kind of stuff to my boyfriend in front of me. 

So naturally, already dealing with a bit of anxiety, I just  felt yuck about him going over to have a spa with her. I know what she's like. Not that I think anything would happen, I'm just not comfortable about the level of conversation she would try to have espicially without me there.

When I asked what time he was leaving, he said he wasn't because he could tell I was annoyed. And I agreed that yes I was annoyed and uncomfortable that he was going to leave, especially with how I was feeling at the time. 

Well, now he's upset and sulky saying he doesn't catch up with her much. I told him to go if he really needed, but he's stayed home and now I feel like a bit of a dick.

c17hpk	2019-06-16 07:41:03	fivethousandwords	AITA for refusing to invite my boyfriend’s female friend to the dinner party I threw for him?	"  My boyfriend Cam and I have been dating since early this year. It’s been great for the most part, but for the past couple of months we’ve been having arguments about his friend Lauren. 

Lauren and I don’t really get along. She’s like a sister to Cam so I tried to befriend her when we started dating, but she was always aloof to me. She’s very friendly with other people, but whenever I tried to talk to her, she would just answer with a few words then talk to someone else or leave. She would also make me feel out of place whenever we hung out with Cam’s other friends by bringing up things from their college days so everyone would be talking or laughing about something that I don’t know. 

I told Cam how I felt but he said that I must be misreading the situation because Lauren is not that kind of person. He said that I should give it more time, that maybe Lauren doesn’t know me that well yet that’s why she doesn’t talk to me a lot. But I know that she has befriended people who were introduced to her after I was, like Arlo, Cam’s friend from his new job which he started in March. The three of them play online games for hours while she hasn’t spent 3 minutes talking to me. 

More than once I asked Cam to talk to Lauren about why she doesn’t like me, but he refused. He said that unless Lauren was ignoring me or talking shit about me, she technically isn’t doing anything wrong by not being besties with me, and it would just make things awkward between the three of us. One time I told him that would talk to Lauren myself, and he said that I was making a mountain out of a molehill.

Last Friday was Cam’s birthday so I threw a small dinner party at his favorite restaurant for him and invited our friends, excluding Lauren. I figured that I’m the one throwing the party so I should be able to invite who I want to, and I don’t want to invite and pay for someone who has shown time and time again that she doesn’t like my company and is not interested in being friends with me. 

Cam was really happy about the surprise at first, but when he learned that Lauren wasn’t going to be there, he pulled me aside and said I was an asshole for leaving Lauren out. He said I should’ve thought about how Lauren would feel if she learns that I invited everyone except her. I was shocked that he would say that when he knew how Lauren has treated me, so I told him that I just gave Lauren a taste of her own medicine and maybe now she’ll know how I feel when she leaves me out of conversations. 

Cam got really angry and said that he can’t be with someone who would treat Lauren like that. He stormed out of the restaurant and we’ve only talked once after that. I texted him yesterday to apologize and he said we should meet in person today to talk about this. I don’t even know what I should say to him.

c17e0w	2019-06-16 07:24:45	menthagelatin	AITA for making life hellish for a cadet with severe ADHD?​	"As a cadet squad leader at a military high school in VA, my responsibility was to manage 5 other cadets, making sure that all of them mustered on time, kept clean, and maintained a small section of the barracks, just a hallway running the length of the school. The squad consisted of myself (10th grade), some nonessential elements for this post, the former squad leader (11th grade, Carl), and the subject of my post (9th grade, Jayden, who had moderately severe ADHD). 

Apparently, the former squad leader, Carl, had never actually enforced that the squad's cleanup be properly maintained. I fixed this when I was promoted, causing Jayden to incessantly pester me about how Carl was a much better leader, mostly just because they were friends. I spent between thirty minutes and an hour each day cleaning up after Jayden, be it his blatant disregard for protocol in formations and mess hall, his tendencies to run around the school and fight with others, or just his love of pestering high ranked leaders in the school. 

I began to try and use positive reinforcement, making up contests that he was set to win as long as he could just perform at the bare-minimum standard, but to no avail. Positivity reinforcement took more work than negative and yielded no results, so eventually I switched over. By the end of the year, I had tried every punishment I was permitted, things like indefinitely cutting his room's power, confiscating his electronics, making him eat last in mess, and even preventing him from leaving with his parents on weekends, which was by no means a right at school, actually a rare privilege.

Trying to understand the root cause of this led me to talk to both him and his parents, at which point I learned he had stopped taking his ADHD meds just before I became squad leader, instead opting for ""natural management"" as he called it, nope. He just didn't want to take the meds, he thought they restrained his spirit or something of the sort. I stated that this was bunk, that was there exact job, and he needed his spirit to get some goddamn restraint real quick, but he brushed off anything I would say.

I finally gave him an ultimatum: Jayden would get back on his meds (or find some alternative method to get a grip, but meds would have been easiest), or I would stop trying to understand his situation and just rain bullshit down on him directly from my first sergeant (1SG) for the last few weeks of the schoolyear. Long story short, he didn't fix it and I made the last three weeks of school suck for him, of course I let him have finals to do what needed doing, but he had daily PT for a while, ate last at every meal, did extra cleaning, had no devices, and the only power in his room was to his lights.

AITA for having made his final few weeks of the year suck?

c17bsl	2019-06-16 07:14:38		AITA for telling my ex-girlfriend that she isn't a good human and that she sucks even more than I thought ?	"Around 1 year ago our relationship ended. The reason was another guy. She kept meeting up with him, which was fine, but at some point they met up for \~ 10 hours which made me a little bit jealous. I asked her if she can keep the length of the meetups to a shorter amount, which was followed by her telling me that he has to prioritize the guy over me.

1 week later she demonstrated this pretty clearly, by cancelling a date with me on a holiday to go out with the guy. At this point there was no way for me to tell if she was cheating or not (I later found out that she wasn't, the guy is gay, but we both didn't know this back then. At this point pretty much everything just screamed ""Yes, she is cheating.""), but even if she didn't cheat that behaviour was extremely hurtful, especially because she only knew him since 1 month and we knew each other since 5 years and she straight up told me that she has to prioritize him over me.

We got into multiple fights and it ended with her breaking up and then after  the break up she continued with her shitty behaviour.

So 1 year later and I meet her in the city. She wants to grab a coffee with me. I didn't want to at first, but I still have feelings for her (yea I know) so I decided to say yes. 

So we were talking about what happened and she basically told me ""Oh back then.. yea. I was surprised that I actually managed to break up with you. I still loved you, but I didn't want to keep hurting you by meeting up with the guy, who by the way turned out to be gay, so I decided to sacrifice the relationship so you don't have to be jealous and feel bad all the time. I just wanted to make you feel better""

I was speechless. I expected a lot, but not that she portrays it like she did me a favor.

I told her ""I don't know how your subconscious managed to convince you that you are some kind of hero, but you aren't. You decided to cut me out of your life, because you didn't want to stop ""prioritizing"" a guy that you knew since 1 month over me. You know what would have been easier ? Not cancelling dates with me to meet up with the guy and treating me like a partner and somebody that you love. You decided to hurt me even more, because you didn't want to stop hurting me at all. I knew you were a shitty human, but I didn't expect you to be such a fucked up person. But keep telling yourself that you are good human, it's easier than to accept that your a complete bitch, isn't it ? Fuck you.""

She cried, I left the café. A few hours later her best friend texted me and told me that I'm an asshole and various other things.

I agree that I could have said it nicer. The ""bitch"" and ""fuck you"" wasn't nice, especially because I'm usually a really calm person so that probably shocked her. But am I the asshole here ? I feel like somebody needed to tell her what's up."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

There’s no label on anything though.

Last night we went out with another work friend, she spent about 3/4 hours with a group of other guys and ended up getting with one of them in front of me. I was a pissed off about this but rather than causing a scene I waited until we got to our friend’s house where I told her that it pissed me off, she said that she couldn’t remember it but then went on to say that we’re not in a relationship technically so it shouldn’t bother me and that I’m putting needless pressure on her to be in one by getting annoyed about it in the first place.

We have a great relationship and generally agree on everything related to familial matters.

I have no problem with this whatsoever; she’s very close to her much older siblings and in turn our nieces/nephews.

Most of Barbara’s family lives in said rural area, so my in-laws often host meals for everyone. As such, Barbara and I are always invited.

After a full week of work and other responsibilities, I do value my downtime on the weekends. Barbara, however, will take issue with me if I say that I do not want to travel an hour to her parents’ house, spend about 2-3 hours there, and travel an hour back home.

She will argue that “I’m just watching sports/movies or playing video games”, so I have no obligation to not go. Oddly enough, if I’m playing tennis, then she considers it a viable excuse.

For context, I am there for every birthday of her immediate family as well as every holiday. Additionally, her parents come to the city where we live frequently enough to where I see them at least once a month on average, if not more.

My friend who was throwing the party asked if we could chip in $5-$10 and he’d get some alcohol for everyone. I knew beforehand that I wouldn’t be drinking because I couldn’t stay long and I had to drive home but I chipped in $7.50 anyway. 

When I’m leaving the party and I see an unopened fifth of Bacardi that he got for the party and I decide to take it because why not. No one saw me take it and no one knew I was going to take it so it seemed like I had gotten away with it.

The next day my friend sends a message in the party group chat asking what happened to his bottle of Bacardi. I felt guilty so I texted him privately and apologized for taking it and offered to pay him back for it. He responds with “You’re getting me another one.”. I again offer to just pay him back because it’s simpler and all he says is “15 bucks.”. So I Venmo him the money and get no response. I waited for him to say thank you but it never came so I sent him another message explaining that I didn’t have to come forward and he never would’ve known it was me but I did and he should’ve at least said thanks for the money. Finally, he responds saying that I shouldn’t do something dickish and expect gratitude. 

I know I’m an asshole for taking the bottle in the first place but when he asked who took it I could’ve easily remained silent and no one would’ve known a thing. But I decided to turn a wrong into a right and all I got in response was a sour attitude that made me regret coming forward in the first place.

The way his profession works, it wouldn’t work out for him to keep the kids for days or even a day by himself. He’d either have to barely see the kids or get a different job. To let him be with the kids often, he comes to my house, and I have to be there too as he can get a call and have to leave immediately. I don’t HAVE to facilitate this, but I do for the sake of my kids and him.

In exchange, I’ve got wishes that WILL be respected or l won’t be so appeasing. I laid all of this out to him when I first left him. My “rules” are pretty understandable

1. He is not to raise his voice at me, ever, under any circumstances.
2. He is not to smoke cigarettes at my house, or smoke right before he comes to my house. I don’t want to smell it at all.
3. His must clean up after himself at my house.

This past week I told him he needed to go to the doctor and get his hearing checked and take care of whatever the problem is, a hearing aid or whatever they suggest. Some background: his hearing is BAD and became one of the many strains on our relationship. He can’t hear for shit and he refuses to acknowledge it. It’s getting worse and it’s so, so annoying. I can be YELLING right behind him and he won’t hear me. I’m not willing to be around it anymore.

He’s saying I’m trying to use the kids to control him and I’m just going to keep finding more things I don’t like and making him change. I was like, yeah, that will probably happen. I’m not willing to deal with all the annoying things you wouldn’t fix in our marriage. Now that I’ve left you, I expect to not deal with them anymore. I explained if that’s not good enough, we can change our arrangement so that I don’t have to be around him as much and it’s not an issue. He reiterated that he needs the set up to stay how it is. So I told him I expect to be able to get a response from him when I need one.

I’m bending over backwards so the kids can see their dad several times a week, and he can stay a very active member of their lives. I expect him to reciprocate. Which means, getting his hearing checked/getting a hearing aid even though he doesn’t want to.

We were just watching YouTube videos on my one friend's xbox and having a good time. Then my one friend gets a call from a woman. She says it's been a crazy few days and just wants to hang out. We convince her to come over but I'm a little worried. Last time she came over she ended up controlling the xbox and not really letting anyone else have it, on top of that saying 2 of our 3 friends selection sucked. I thought it might be her having a bad night, so I gave her another chance. Tonight she did the same thing, telling us how both of our stuff sucks and not letting us have the remote. After a few minutes of this and the owner of the xbox saying I could play something and her refusing to let me have it I say to her ""Why are you being such a bitch."" She gets defense and says I'm just mad because no one likes my videos. After about 10 minutes of sitting there I just get up and leave, and my one friend asking if I'm alright as I'm walking out and I say yeah. I normally don't do this but I was just tired of her ruining a good night we were having and wanted to send a clear message without telling her to leave."	Not the A-hole	0	0	124.0	17.0	0.0	0.0

c16yhz	2019-06-16 06:18:30	datlj	AITA for expecting the same support for my medical problems as I gave my sister for hers?	"TLDR at end.

I(34) have given my sister(39) an enormous amount of emotional support over the years when she found out several years ago that she was Stage 3 Lymes Disease. So for 15 years she went undiagnosed, going to different doctors with no results. 

I listened to her during this time crying about the pain and suffering she was going through. It's been about 3yrs since she found out and was put on medication. The infection is gone but it has lasting effects due to how long it took her to get treated.

She also had foot problems over the years from having a deformed plantar tendon that required surgery to fix. Again, I listened to her when her bf(40) got tired of her crying to him about the constant pain.

This past March I had a issue with my back and this horrible nerve pain in my arms and legs. Doctors thought it was shingles so I took the antiviral medicine for it. Nope, not shingles. This pain was just...you couldn't touch my skin because it felt like firey pokers stabbing me and I ended up taking off a lot from work.

I got Xrays done and I'm told my spine is curved due to muscles spasming. So after spending $3200 on a Chiropractor, all my nerve pain goes away but now I have centralized pain in my lumbar area upper butt. Finally I'm unfortunately diagnosed with sacroiliitis, the athritis kind, due to years of inflammation from ulcerative colitis and extremely horrible periods. I don't know what I can do now to fix this or where to start.

The entire process I'm communicating with my sister, not crying about it but keeping her updated. Over the last few weeks when I mentioned how I'm doing I was getting radio silence from her. No responses to texts. I found out on Thursday my diagnosis after some tests and told my sister Friday but didn't go into detail, again dead air. I mentioned it again today just to confirm if she is ignoring me. No response.

I called her up and then out on her bullshit and being selfish, how I supported her and listened to her all those years and the least she could do was give me some back. Needless to say she used the fact she has Lymes for life and how I'm just complaining about something cureable(it's not for me) She's tired of hearing about my pain and how I'm an asshole for calling her selfish. She hung up on me.

So AITA here?

TLDR: Sister had undiagnosed lymes for years then diagnosed, all the while I'm emotionally supportive through it. I get bad back and nerve pain, find out it's from years of angry intestines and uterus. Get 0 support from sister."	Not the A-hole	0	0	24.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c16ycy	2019-06-16 06:17:55		AITA for ace-ing out my step mom? You	"So this happened a little while ago. I’m 16(m) and relatively smart. School has always been very easy for me and I’ve always aced all my classes. Up until freshman year i was doing great. I started not doing assignments because I’m lazy and just didn’t want to. Got grounded like a normal kid for bad grades and all that but it was slightly more harsh. I got literally everything taken out of my room, got left with only a mattress on the floor cause “bedframes are a privilege”. Only one pillow was given as well. 

       Fast forward to the end of sophomore year. I got the same grades as I had before. Nothing failing, but they weren’t good. That’s when it started. They threatened to sell everything except my clothes and bed. 

        Then for about six months I kept getting told that i “wasn’t wanted at the house, or I make it super stressful and miserable” at my dads house by my step mom. Six months of this. Being hammered in my head that I wasn’t good enough and that I make everyone’s life worse. After those six months I over heard a conversation with my step mom and dad. My dad said something that I couldn’t hear, then my step mom said something along the lines of “we can’t emancipate him, he doesn’t have an income”. This pissed me off. I hadn’t gotten a job yet, due to some major social anxiety I have, but rather not like to tell my parents cause they’ll call it some stupid excuse, which it is. So I went downstairs, and said, “I’ll just go live with my mom. I can tell you guys don’t like when I’m here.” This caused her to go COMPLETELY 180 and have a sobbing fit. I was a bit taken aback, but more cautious. 

       So I basically stone faced it while she pleaded with me to stay. I just keep saying, “I’m still gonna go.” She eventually leaves to go to her friends house. My dad comes home and talks to me about how they were wrong about the things they had said, but then pointing the finger at me by saying that I had caused them to be super stressed. He took me to my moms. I was there for about a week and a half before he begged me to come back. So I did, and my step mom picked me up from school, but said that every day and night I spend at my dads, she will leave and stay with her mom.

       My dad now blames me for everything that has happened and keeps trying to get me to talk to her. He also tells me they stick by what they said for those six months. I have a job now (at Starbucks, a massive shock considering I have crippling social anxiety, but I’m working on it, and my manager tells me she’s super proud which for once feels great to hear) but I never see my step mom. She was pregnant during the first three of those six months, and she blamed my actions on “newborn jealousy”. That was not true. I have a half sister who is 9, and I went through that jealousy when I was 7. It’s now been two months of me not seeing my step mom, and I think my dad dislikes me.

c16v56	2019-06-16 06:04:31		AITA for letting strippers paddle me at my best friend's Bachelor Party?	"First, some background:

My best friend, who we'll call R, and I have been inseparable since we were six years old. We've been friends through growing up, moving to different parts of the country, moving to different countries entirely, and so on.

  


R found his someone and they're being married in July. He asked me to be his Best Man and I agreed.

  


This past weekend was his Bachelor Party. It has been almost constant drinking (for them, I've been DDing mostly), guy bonding, funny stories and memories, what I assume is the usual Party fair.

  


Some of the other guys had strippers come over to the house last night.  I had promised my wife I wouldn't be an active participant in these shenanigans, but ultimately capitulated to peer pressure and had my ass spanked. I turned down all further demands for my active participation. 

  


I admitted what happened when she questioned me after presumably looking up strippers for hire in the area we're staying in. She became very upset with me, saying I had promised not to be involved, that it's obvious I don't respect her, and that I'm too old for peer pressure (mid-30's). Lastly, she told me to call an Uber from the airport when I get home, she won't be picking me up, and that she'll be staying with her mom for a while. 

  


I don't know if this has any bearing on it, but things have been stressful at home with a pending big move from HI to CA, the fact that we're going to be having twins in October, and the fact that the Air Force is a bureaucratic nightmare. Both of us have been highly stressed for about three or four months.

""I live in Japan and the rumor floating around is that girls in Korea are starting to act as dramatic as the girls in their Korean soap operas""

So I responded with this : 

""It's off topic, but I'm an american that watches a good amount of anime, and would be interested in better understanding your culture. A large question I find myself asking is what is the deal with males and females hanging out together, or living together? While there is plenty of gender based social constructs in America, it seems nearly forbidden and taboo for male and females to have platonic relationships.

Additionally my understanding is males and females are not treated with equal social rank, which as an American I of course don't agree with, so I'm interested in why that is? What is the justification for it?""

The thing is, I've gotten several people who reacted negatively to this comment, saying things like:

""If you're legitimately serious, you need some serious professional help. Socially, I mean. This kind of awkwardness can't be cured by just making small talk with strangers and eventually ""leveling up"" in your terms - you need to see a counselor, life coach, idk.

c16uab	2019-06-16 06:01:11	thelovelymissmalfoy	WIBTA If I distanced myself from my chronically ill best friend of ten years for no apparent reason	" I have been friends with Betty and Sally since we were in kindergarten. Our Freshman year Betty got sick. It would basically put her in huge levels of pain and make her stuck in the bathroom for at least 45 mins. This didn't have a heavy hit on our friendship, we still talked everyday and hanged out most weekends. But as time went on her illness got worse. She had to drop school and only do homeschooling. At first this had little effect, we texted her everyday, hung out or called every weekend.

But, Betty got more and more recluse. She stopped responding to our texts and calls. It got so bad that we would go weeks with out hearing from her. We eventually took to stopping by her house unannounced on the weekends to just say hi, and see if she wanted to hang out. I see now that this wasn't the nicest thing to do, but we had no other way to contact her. This went on until my Senior year, through another friend I found out that Betty was on a Discord with a bunch of online friends. I was able to see that she would message these people at least every ten minutes from the time she got up until the time she went to bed. I was extremely furious and heartbroken, because I know Betty only uses Discord via her phone. To know that she was talking to these online friends every second of the day while actively ignoring her only in person friends broke my heart.

This all came to head last week. Sally was going off to a foreign country to do charity work, she will be gone all of June with no way of communicating to us the entire time. So I planned a mini party to celebrate before she left very small just five friends getting lunch then paying games at my house. I texted everyone two weeks in advance, no reply. A few days later I call Betty to see if she plans on coming or not, no answer but Betty texts me promising with all her heart that she will be there. I text back to meet at my place at 5 so we can all carpool to get food. The day of the party roles around, at five there is no Betty, I text, I call, no answer. We wait 30 mins, before I just decided to drive by Betty's house, two blocks away, with everyone to see if she's just running late. (Betty is notorious for running late, even before she got sick.) Betty's dad answer's the door and tells us Betty has been sick since seven this morning and will not be able to come. We stay for a bit as Betty's parents wanted to ask Sally about her trip. Eventually, Betty comes out of her room, phone in hand, says sorry guys and goes back to her room not saying a word to Sally. I had never been so mad at her.

c16u66	2019-06-16 06:00:45	myydixierekttt	AITA for telling people to leave me and my rescue dog alone?	"Kinda a weird post. I adopted a pit/American bulldog mix in November. She’s about 80 pounds. She is a rescue and used to be a bait dog. She is the most loving dog I’ve ever had in my entire life...to me. 

She is incredibly leash reactive/aggressive towards any other animal or stranger and has attacked another dog before (slipped her harness, didn’t land any bites)

Ever since that day, I have muzzled my dog out of the safety of others. I’m working very hard on training her and having meet and greets to re-socialize her. 

However, it seems almost once a week when I walk her, I run into some ignorant old women that can’t seem to mind their own business. My dog is already a Pit mix and having her muzzled amplifies the stereotype of her looking mean. She also growls and barks and lunges at people that walk by us. So to make people feel more safe, I hold her behind me, only give her about 2-3 feet of lead at a time (she always walks right beside me) and when someone comes close to us I hold her by her harness so she cannot go anywhere. 

It never fails that people when they walk by just HAVE to make some stupid remark about how mean she looks and how evil she looks and how she is going to bite them (impossible, she’s muzzled) and how she could kill them.

I’ve gotten so sick of it that I’ve come to the point that I’ve started saying just as stupid things back to them. 

Example: Woman said she’s looking right at my ankles like she wants to bite them. I said well keep walking or else I’ll let her 

Woman said she looks like she wants to eat me. I said she probably does so you should probably get away from us. 

Just stupid things like that. Keep in mind. Women are stopping, as they see me(22F) holding back an 80lb pitbull trying to restrain her and help her calm down, they feel the need to talk shit to me. 

AITA for talking shit back to them? This post is probably a cluster fuck but I just jotted it all down at once

EDIT: okay I understand that I’m an asshole for making threats that I know I would never go through with but strangers don’t. Super asshole. I get that. But to those of you saying my dog doesn’t even deserve to live are assholes too and please stop commenting it. My dog has no less of a right to live just because she used to be abused. I take absolutely every precaution I can to put OTHERS safety first. I said in the post she is always muzzled, she has a different harness that is impossible to slip, I hold her by her harness, and hold her behind me and try walking away from people anytime I notice they come near. I get that me making bitchy comments is not necessary and I’m an asshole which I thought would be the consensus. However, I am working to rehabilitate this poor girl and help her learn that not everyone is out to get her. I love her so much that I take so many extra steps to make sure that I don’t lose her by her attacking someone. Please stop telling me to put my dog down and that she can’t be saved because she’s already made so much progress. Thanks

EDIT 2:: I feel the need to say that I’m not pissed at their concern for their safety. I get that my dog looks very intimidating and scary. I think they’re assholes for feeling the need to stop and lecture me about my dog only making the situation worse and making her more scared. My dog is not a mean dog. She is a scared dog. She is terrified of everyone and dog. I am not putting her down but thanks for the suggestion. She will get better. I’m not replying anymore."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	49.0	32.0	0.0	0.0
c16tkq	2019-06-16 05:58:17	nspaceno1cnhearUscrm	WIBTA: Father's Day conflict with Mother	"Hi Reddit. I (27F) need your help. I am beyond being able to look at my relationship with my mother objectively. 

For background: my mom (62F) had an extremely busy job out of town during my teen years (12-18) and so I feel that I kind of ""grew up"" without her. She was usually home on weekends but during the week, it was just me and my dad. When she retired when I was 18 she tried to reinsert herself into her ""mom"" role, but continued to treat me like a kid. I'm now 27 and she still tries to control and guilt me. We've had a pretty rough relationship, and even did some therapy (the therapist agreed and said that she needed to stop trying to control me). She wants to be involved in my life so much that she over steps and tries to run it. For example, she decided to decorate (without asking) when my husband and I moved into our new house and I told her to stop because we hadn't decided where we wanted things to go yet - she got mad and called me selfish and then went and cried to my dad. 

Now, here is the problem I'm struggling with. My dad was my best friend. I had a close relationship with him, and he often acted as a buffer between me and my mom. He passed away a few years ago from cancer. It's been really hard on me, but I feel like I've come to a positive place. My mom, on the other hand, is not dealing well. She has upped her guilt game in trying to develop a closer relationship with me, and I feel that all it's done is put a larger wedge between us. She tries to get me to come visit all the time, but we live an hour away and both work 10-11hr days. Plus, when we do visit, she wants it to be for HOURS. Not just a couple. Like four, six, seven.... With it being Father's Day, I want to go visit my dad's grave tomorrow. But I don't want to deal with my mom and her grief. I don't want to shoulder her emotional baggage around my dad. I don't want to sit and cry with her for hours - it's just so emotionally draining. I don't want a day where I just want to miss my dad to become about her and our relationship. I am thinking of going up and not telling her that I'm in town. However, I know she'll call me and ask if I'm coming. She'll then either guilt me if I say no by saying I should come visit my dad, or guilt me if I say yes if I don't stop and see her.

c16t8n	2019-06-16 05:56:56	TBlizzey	AITA for wanting rent money?	"I am currently under a ""rent to own"" contract with my dad for the house that I grew up in. The game plan is to rent it for a few years and he'd put away money every month so I can eventually roll that in to a down payment.

My brother has been renting the basement from me since I moved in and he pays me rent every month. I just recently had a friend move in to a spare bedroom and she also pays me rent.

A few months ago, my brother's ""girlfriend"" asked me if she could stay here a few nights a week because she has a job and an internship here but actually lives in another state with her parents. It's about a 2 hour drive to her parents house so being the nice guy that I am, I said sure. I only said this because it seemed like my brother was going to date her and I did this as a courtesy for him.

He recently broke things off with her but she's still been staying here. She's been trying to find a place to move but that seems to not be working out. I don't think she's trying all that hard because she still has a thing for my brother and would rather stay here and be his fuck buddy over nothing. She sleeps in his bed still but is always upstairs hanging out and frankly makes a fuckin mess in my kitchen.

She just told me the other day that she's going to pay my brother rent money because he asked her to. I'm thinking to myself that that's bullshit and if she's going to pay anyone then it should be me. I jokingly mentioned it to my brother that I knew about it and he kinda clammed up. I also somewhat jokingly told him to fork over half of it and he said ""she stays in the basement why would I give you any money? It's only $200 it's not even that much"".

I talked to my girlfriend about it and she agreed, if they were dating, this whole thing would make sense. Since they're not, I'm pretty sure I should be getting that money. My problem is, I'm non confrontational with my family so I don't really know how I should go about this. 

Help me out here guys. Am I the asshole for asking for the rent money?

I’m a social media “influencer” with about 10k followers. Not a huge following, but I live in a small city so it’s considered big for where we are. So obviously my account is not on private so anyone who isn’t a follower, also gets access to my account. 

Recently, this new girl followed me who looks similar to me. Same hair color, eye color, same weight etc, all in all we look really similar. She has only about 2k followers and regularly likes my pictures and has commented on them telling me I’m pretty, which is really sweet. I followed her back and that was that. 

Well, my boyfriends friend was using a popular dating site and come across a picture of HER face using numerous pictures of my body. I’ve had a lot of catfishing incidents before so my blood was boiling that someone I knew was using my pictures and in the same state as if I wouldn’t find out? 

I direct messaged her and cursed her out. I exposed her on my page and told her to take down the profile and that I was going to report her. She messaged me back asking what I was talking about and I provided her with the same screen shots that my friend had provided me. She was confused, said she doesn’t use dating apps and that, that picture of her face was heavily photoshopped. I scrolled down her page and found the original picture and indeed the dating app picture was very photoshopped.

She assured me that it wasn’t her. She said she doesn’t even live in the city that was provided on the dating app, how she had an incident with cat fishing before too, AND a stalker who would steal her pictures and send them over text to scare her. 

Well now, I feel like a god damn idiot. I exposed her all over my page, I cursed the poor girl out and she is just a victim as much as me. I told my boyfriend about this and he called me an asshole and that I should apologize. His reasoning is that we are BOTH “influencers” and both pretty girls, of course someone would use our pictures, and he also added if she were to pose as me, why would she do it in the same state, let alone follow me and comment on my pictures? I feel like I shouldn’t apologize but on the other hand I feel bad. I mean the idea of someone posing as me isn’t far fetched."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Last year, one of my friends whom I was really close with became a cam girl, and she wanted to use my PayPal as a middle man for her transactions. I wasn’t initially comfortable with it, but I agreed to it. This only happened twice, and on the second time I must’ve done something incorrectly but she would’ve gotten her money two or three days later instead of instantly. She completely flipped out on me, called me many vile things and pretty much just attacked me. This maybe unnecessary, but I was in an emotionally abusive relationship and she seen what it is like during that relationship, and it reminded me of the same tactics my ex used on me. 

A couple days later I sent her the money via Messenger and I started one wording her while she was attempting to make conversation. After blowing up on me again, I told her I was angry at the fact that she never apologized for what she said to me, that I was deeply hurt by what she said, and all I wanted was for her to recognize what she has done and apologize. Instead, she blamed it on her anxiety and other mental health issues and I told her that is not an excuse for her actions. I have depression and anxiety as well, and while I do lash out at people I do not mean to lash out on, I apologize to them and attempt to fix what I’ve done. 

To this day we barely talked and our friendship has been boiled down to just people who are friends on Facebook. She messages me from time to time asking for random advice, but I give her little to no reply because I’m still honestly hurt that she has not apologized and think that how she acted is okay. I asked my girlfriend and my best friend if I’m doing the right thing and they are on my side about this, but I just feel like I’m coming off as a cold hearted jerk. AITA?"

About a month ago FR was commenting on a mutual friend’s post about her dog chewing stuff up. FR was talking about his gf’s cat and I joking called out his pup for chewing up stuff. I very honestly just meant it as a joke and it really didn’t go any deeper than “your dog chews stuff up.” He got snippy and rude so I just dropped it, send a screenshot to DH, and just kind of laughed and said FR has some anger issues. 
That evening DH called me on his way home from working wanting to know what else happened. Nothing. Apparently FR was texting him at work about me? DH showed me the texts and it was pretty much 
FR: you at work?  DH: yeah
FR: you need to control you woman 
DH: ?
FR: She’s online. Tell her to get a hobby. 
DH: lol. What can I say? It makes her happy just don’t engage. 
FR: that’s like saying never speak to her

I was pissed. At FR but also at DH for not sticking up for me and allowing someone to be so disrespectful about me to him. It hurt and we ended up fighting. 
DH sent FR a text saying he was out of line and that in the future he needs to handle issues he has with me with me, and not drag DH into it. 
FR sent me a message saying he was sorry and that he was going through some stuff. I pretty much told him that his problems weren’t an excuse to be an ass and that I don’t put up with shit like that. 
I have a long history of emotionally abusive family members who all use mental health problems as an excuse to hurt and use others, so I admitted have very little sympathy. 

Since then DH and FR haven’t talked though. I told DH that day that I still wanted him and FR to be friends, but he needed to remind FR that there are boundaries. 
AITA for getting angry about this? Should I have just let it go? Or at the very least handled it differently?
I feel guilty that they aren’t speaking but honestly have no motivation to see or be around FR. 
I feel like it’s partly my fault they aren’t talking though. DH says he just hasn’t gotten around to calling FR, but I think he feels a little awkward about it. I also think FR feels like we (or at least DH) are still mad."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

It's bothered me why I don't like him, and I need to know if I'm just being stubborn.
When they were first starting to date, his bf would call me names as a ""joke"". Names like psycho and whatnot, even after I told him to stop. I was going through a hard mental time, and it didn't help that they were both laughing at this. He would also make comments about frying my pet rats, who are basically my children.
We bicker/argue often, (and had a massive fight for a week a month ago) especially lately, when my bff suddenly bought it on me that, hey, bf is moving in, because his abusive grandfather is staying at his home, 2 hours away. Like, within a week he was living with us, in the condo the 2 of us lived in.
I was under the assumption that it was short term, but it doesn't seem like that any more, as he now has a job here.
And now, when we got back from pride, I find it my bff proposed.

So, I'm graduating from uni this year and tomorrow is my ceremony which ends at 4PM. We both have a friend that is also having her ceremony tomorrow, but ends at 1PM and the area is pretty close to each other. My gf told me that she was attending our friends ceremony, but couldn't come to my ceremony because she needs to get back home to celebrate Father's day.

I personally have no problem with her skipping my ceremony to celebrate with her family (it's a big deal to her), but I asked her why she couldn't celebrate it later since my ceremony doesn't end that late, she would however get back probably around 6-8PM.... The excuse she gave me was that she has to eat early so she can digest her food early (She sleeps early 8-10PM) and that she has to work early the next day (around 8AM), her mom also has to work really early (\~4AM). And so, I got really annoyed when she gave me that excuse, because during mother's day she skipped celebrating it to attend a concert (Her point was that it was a once in a life time thing).

I told her that her excuse to not come to my ceremony was shit, that she could easily go, and still celebrate father's day even though it's going to be late, and she tells me that I can't understand her or her situation and that we need to rethink the relationship...

I feel like I've overreacted to the situation, I feel bad that her parents has to celebrate it late if she did attend my ceremony. But, my ceremony is basically just a one time thing, and I really wanted her to come. idk the more I think about the situation, the more I feel like I am the asshole since I don't really see Father's day the way her family does and I'm just overreacting to the whole situation..

I started getting worried. It wasn't hot. But this is a place people park for hours at a time, and I just don't think a dog should be left in a car for that long (I might feel differently if there was a grocery store nearby or something similar where a person could stop by really quick). Plus it's been getting crazy hot for this area, and I don't think leaving an animal in car for a long time should be a default practice. 

I tried calling animal rescue, the non-emergency line, etc to see if there was something I could do/just to let someone know. Both lines were down, and redirected me to 911. So I called, explained the situation, they told me I called the right number, and said they would try and send someone over. I decided to wait for either the owner or the police to show up just in case. I just felt uncomfortable with the dogs being left alone. I waited for an hour and 20 minutes before I saw the owner come and drive away. The dogs were probably in there longer than that. The police didn't show up as far as I know (there's been no follow-up). 

There were a couple of people who live in the apartment complex who asked me what I was doing. I told them. And they made me feel like I overreacted for calling someone. One person said ""well what are you worried about? It's not unsafe"" and another person said ""it's not even hot"". So I'm wondering if I overreacted? AITA for what I did?"

Fast forward to this month. We find out the cat indeed does have owners, two backyards away. AND suddenly warm weather reveals we have a massive flea infestation. 

So we did the reasonable thing; bombed the house, washed all the bedding and banned the neighbors' cat from the house.

Before booking the reservation, I discussed the outing with my wife who was against it due to the inherent risks involved. I also am a new father with a five month old.

She is aware that the risk of accident is low but she asks why even take the risk, especially with her and a newborn that rely on my support. A few points:

&#x200B;

1. It is a tandem skydiving experience a couple hours away.
2. I am going with two friends that also have not gone skydiving before.
3. I will be skipping work but will be home in time to take care of my household responsibilities.
4. My wife is a full-time working mom as well.

c16a49	2019-06-16 04:44:24		AITA for telling my SO of almost 3 years that I think she's conceited for wanting to change her name?	"Right off the top, I feel it's important to say that we are madly in love with each other, and if she really wants to change her name, I won't stop her and I'll love her all the same. I don't need anyone telling us to end our relationship.

So, basically she asked what I thought about her switching her first and middle names around with each other. For anonymity reasons obviously I won't be telling any of our names, but her first name is a fairly common name while her middle name is less common. Not unheard of or incredibly rare, but definitely less common than her first.

I mistakenly thought this was just a whimsical hypothetical because I've never heard her say she wanted to change her name nor do I remember her expressing any displeasure with her name, except for when people can't properly spell it. So I quickly responded with, ""I've never understood why people change their names. It just seems conceited to me, like trying to be someone you're not.""

Well, it was right after I said this that I noticed this was a bigger deal to her than I previously thought. It offended her, and she said that her father originallly wanted her middle name to be her first name, and she would feel a ""fresh start"" from the change. I told her that if she wants to she can, but that it would probably feel weird coming out of my mouth for a while. She seemed turned off of the idea then, because she didn't want to do something I obviously had a negative opinion of.

c168dl	2019-06-16 04:38:13	YouDontGetAPass	AITA for telling a girl she looks better with makeup on?	"Anger-inducing bait title: Achieved. Here we go:

So I'm a guy who usually keeps my head shaved/buzzed or bald as often as possible, mainly because of my hairline. The part that grows though does grow fast.

At work though I usually wear a hat mainly because (in addition to the above reasons and wanting to look good) I work outside and I sunburn easily. Occasionally (And rarely) after I shave/buzz I'll work without it and wear sunblock instead.

So there's this girl at work (I'll call her Dani) I've known for maybe a couple years. I don't think she's on the spectrum or anything, but I feel like she may not be all-there in social situations, definitely heard her say some things that were weird or off. Also I barely know this girl, I've maybe had a few extensive conversations with her, but never hung out outside of work or anything.

So today was one of those days I just recently shaved and decide not to wear my hat and let it all hang out. Dani is there, she immediately sees me, doesn't miss a beat and blurts out, with a smiley/cheery tone ""**Hey! Wow what happened to your hat? Aww, you look better with your hat on!**""

Of course I'm kinda shocked and taken aback by this comment, I don't need to explain why. Dani, however, was confused and didn't seem to understand why that's such a weird thing to say. She supposedly meant it as a 'complement'. So to that, I responded with - wait for it - saying she looks better with makeup on. I mean, I figured it was an appropriate analogy, basically telling someone ""you look better when you mask one of your natural features"". And yes, I'm well-aware how it would make most girls feel.

She actually didn't seem bothered by that comment, but other people who heard me kinda did. Honestly I don't actually think that, but I wanted to make a point of how it feels to be told that.

She then actually responded with something even weirder - basically telling me that ""she's reached the point where nothing from me would affect her personally"" because of how long we've worked together. That was kinda surprising since I see her on the average of maybe twice a month and never hung out with her. She then went on to say something about ""don't you have those friends that are close and you can say whatever to... like tell them if they have a booger or if their fly is down"".

Again, kinda weird that she sees me as that since I barely know her but whatever. I don't agree with the examples she mentioned being analogous to what she said though. I mean maybe if an actual close friend said that to me it wouldn't be as weird, but would still be kinda weird.

c166h4	2019-06-16 04:31:20	GodzillaFlamewolf	AITA For Not Letting My FIL Have His Druggie GF Over To My New House?	"Backstory:  Rented FIL upstairs with wife for 2 years.  He is in his late 60's.  His new ""GF"" (We will call her Lenore) is in her early 30's.  She has an upcoming court date where she will likely go to prison for a few years for drug offences.  Nothing major, think large possesion while shoplifting, all on camera.

Now, I know everyone deserves a second chance, but this person has some issues.  For example, she visited his house drunk after driving on several occasions, and on several others drove home drunk.  She skipped her plea court date, and went on the run for 2 weeks, then ended up in jail for 3 weeks. This was all at the expense of her 10 year old son that stayed with her druggie mom, and her druggie (actual) BF who is also her dealer.  She rejected a plea deal that would keep her out of prison, but make her a felon, all so that she could spend a few months doing meth and drinking (she told the FIL that this was the reason).  She now has a trial date in 2 months.

So, cut to a month ago.  FIL sells his house, and we buy one with the intention of having him move in.  We told him that under no circumstances would she be allowed to know our address, or be at the house.  We made this very clear at least a month before we moved.

Today he informed my wife that Lenore would be visiting tomorrow, then got into a shouting match with my wife when he was told that Lenore was not allowed over.  When I got home I let him know that under no circumstance would she be allowed over, and then walked away without giving him a chance to argue.

Our concerns are that despite some drug users trying to rehab their lives, she has made 0 efforts in that direction, and rejected offers from the government that could help get her clean (plea would require daily drug testing).  With this lifestyle, we are not comfortable with her in our home.  We feel that she could bring her lifestyle to our home, and we would end up robbed blind, or have drugs stashed in our place.

To complicate matters, my wife has a job that will not allow her to associate with felons.  So if Lenore  takes the second plea deal offer (unexpectedly generous of the DA after Lenore skipped town the first time), she could come back to the house as a felon.

On the other hand, she has not done anything to us personally.   Also, people deserve second chances.

I think that the preponderance of evidence that Lenore herself has provided indicates that she has no interest in being a better person, or at least being willing to make the effort to clean up her life, and I dont want to get dragged into the crosshairs.

Anyways, I was playing MineCraft on my PS4. I came back after meeting with some friends for fun since school was done and I was tired so I played to relieve stress. My sister then came and asked to play. I let her and I made a new survival mode to play. Whenever we play, I add a bonus chest and we take turns picking whatever we want. We split some things that can be split and make deals for things that can’t be split. My sister chose the first thing, then I did, and we ended with two options. It was a pickaxe, raw fish, and bread. I made an offer to have either both food options or the pickaxe. It was my turn to pick and I chose the pickaxe. But, for some reason, my sister got mad at me because she wanted to pick the pickaxe, but I thought it was fair since it was my turn to pick something. So, she took a few torches around the chest which were supposed to be mine. She called me stupid and I told her to say sorry. She didn’t, and I’m older than her. So, I decided to take the chance to say something back to her. It was something like this:
Me: Okay. I’m stupid, right?
Sister: Ummm yes. 
Me: You asked for this. *rubs hands together before stating why I’m smarter than her*
Me: When I was in your grade, I was placed in a higher math level. When I was in your grade, I got better grades than you on my report card. When I was in your grade, my teachers—
Sister: OKAY SHUT UP!!

After this, I let out a little chuckle, and she began to get super mad and quit the game. She told my mom, and my other sister who was also there said that I was way too mean to my sister. My mom told me to apologize and I did, but it wasn’t sincere. I don’t think I was in the wrong here since my sister set herself up for me to make fun of her, but everyone else said I did a bad thing.

Last winter there was an argument involving my cousin (44F), her mother (75F), and me and my wife. In the process, we realised that things had been said about my wife that were not true, and that some of the things she said were misreported to others. It's a mix of miscommunication, not being considerate towards my wife, cultural misunderstandings, etc.. 

We were unhappy when we realised what's been said and tried to get some answers. We spent many hours crafting emails that wouldn't offend anyone, and those hours are precious because we're working and taking care of young kids, so we're tired. Long story short, most of our emails were not replied to. From what my mum and brother say, it's too difficult for my cousin and aunt to reply to those emails. They are too long, and email is not their natural way of communication. 

Our emails were sent last November. Despite not having a reply, me and my wife made the family calendar this year with photos of our kids and my cousin's kids for all the family to have at Christmas. The project was supposed to lead us in the direction of reconciliation. But other than thank you emails, our other emails remained unanswered.

I'm now in my home country for a week, by myself. My aunt and cousin have been asking my mother about my stay and whether I will want to see them, and my mum has somehow invited them for lunch without me agreeing to anything. She even wrote I would pick them up by car at the subway station! I told my mother it was not right to do that, and she says she can cancel, which I'm very well planning to make her do, although I'm upset because now I have to be the one canceling the lunch rather than the guy who just says no to seeing them.

My family says something along the line of ""they're your family and they love you (which I don't doubt), can't we just not forget about the past?"" But I don't want to meet with them simply because they have humiliated my wife and didn't reply to our emails. I can get past the misunderstandings, but not the non-replying. To me it shows how much they don't care about fixing the situation. If they were so difficult for them to read, then they could have emailed saying something along the lines of ""it's too difficult for me to read, please make it shorter, say it differently, or whatever"". But they chose not to reply.

I believe they have to be the ones who take a step towards us before any sort of reconciliation can take place. So I don't want them to come for lunch. WIBTA if I cancel the lunch?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

I wasn’t gonna do anything big, but last minute my cousin wanted to party into 12 to celebrate. I invited my best friend because I told her we’d spend it together as well. Long story short, BF does NOT like my cousin. She can be an airhead but she’s never rude or anything and was actually being really sweet on my bday (and I’m used to her so it doesn’t bother me.) Anyway, whole night my BF has such an attitude.  She keeps rolling her eyes at everything, keeps pressing my cousin because she tends to dilly dally, but I’m trying to remain positive cuz it’s my bday. 
It hits 12, we celebrate into my bday, everything’s fine. As we’re walking to the car, my friend keeps asking me if I want to leave, but my cousin wants to take me to a bar. I didn’t really know what to do, so we stand around and smoke weed. My BF doesn’t smoke, and she’s getting clearly increasingly irritated. (Mindyou, her attitude has already effected the night but everyone around her ignores it for my sake). I ask her if she’s ok and tell her she’s killing the vibe.  I was actually being really nice about it. I know people say this but I’m super non confrontational and don’t have problems with anyone. She gets pissed, and says “well maybe I should just leave then” and pulls up the Uber app. I get pissed and walk away cuz I can’t believe how she’s behaving. 
She ends up leaving, I’m kinda in shock that she actually decides to leave. The next day is my bday, and she doesn’t contact me. The next day after that she texts me that she needs to talk. I go over to her house expecting an apology, but she goes on this rant about how I chose my cousin over her and doesn’t apologize once. She never admits she had an attitude, but I’m very empathic and i KNOW HER. I left and we haven’t talked since. 
I would usually be the bigger person, but she’s “dropped” like three other of her best friends for far smaller situations. Maybe I’m better off without the friendship."	Not the A-hole	0	0	0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
c1651w	2019-06-16 04:26:21		AITA - I have reached my breaking point with my sister	"This last situation with my sister has caused me to reach my breaking point. Her mental health history is EXTENSIVE and she refuses help unless she is able to control and manipulate the doctors/facility that she ends up hospitalized in. Now that she is of age, this is all too easy for her. She is denying her diagnosis, and we have no idea what story she is feeding this new facility about her mental health.

When my sister was first diagnosed manic depressive/bipolar, it was devastating for me and my mom. (We are the only people in the family that give a rat's ass about her and have seen everything, and if anyone else on here has experienced a relative with this diagnosis, you know it is NOT pretty). The most devastating thing about all of this to me is 1) I cannot begin to imagine what it is like for my sister. It makes me so sad and I wish she knew that, despite her hating my guts. 2) she is destroying my mother's life and truly affecting my younger siblings. My mom is her biggest advocate and she treats her like garbage. Running up her credit cards, calling CPS on her house, falsifying reports of abuse, anything destructive she's done it against my mom. My sister yells at the kids and has had psychotic episodes in front of them. It breaks my heart.

This last hospitalization, she was staying in the city for outpatient care. Something my mother and I were so hopeful for. (Every single weekend - unless my sister has been hospitalized in a mental health facility - she goes to the ER over some bogus paranoia situation). Anyways, she's doing her outpatient treatment and we didn't know she got hospitalized until my mom was able to get onto her uber account and see that my sister got a ride to the hospital, from whatever bogus paranoia situation she initially went to the ER for. They must of seen her unstable and placed her on a 72 hour hold, this was Monday and today is Saturday. (Uber account charges on my mom's card are upwards $600 in the past month and a half, my sister has no concept of money. She just decides to go wherever she wants. Buys whatever she wants - my mom is too kind and needs to set a boundary here).

My breaking point is here. I've reached it. I just called her at the facility because my mom and I are genuinely worried, we hadn't heard from her and it's been past the usual 72 hour hold. I had her old patient id # from her previous stay where she signed a release to me. Once the nurse informed her that she had a call from me I could hear her get so angry at the nurse, telling her that ""I don't want to talk to her, how could you idiots let her get through to me, you're going to loose your job because of this, LET ME TALK TO HER!!!"" Gets on the phone, you can imagine the rest.

I can't handle this anymore. AITA? I am 25, work hard for the life I have created for myself. I have my own demons. I'm mentally drained. I told my mom I had to set a boundary when it comes to this situation because it's eating me alive. But. I. Feel. So. Guilty."	Not the A-hole	1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

So little back story here. My ex (21m) and I (21f) broke up the first week of May and it got a little ugly. Well my friend, who I'll call E, never really liked my ex for some reason, but never minded asking my ex for rides everywhere. 

Well about a week after the break up, E comes to me and tells me the story about how basically he went to go see his PO. And while he was making the long walk he swears my ex passed him 3 times , and then when E got there he was given a ""surprise"" urine test for pot.(It just became medically legal here) . And E swears that my ex went out there and snitched on him. 
 
E is my best friend but I just don't believe him. Anyway here it is a month later and E says he wants to beat my ex ""For snitching on me to my PO."" I'm kinda over it so I just turned around and yelled ""Oh my god, no he didn't!"" And E said whatever and left the kitchen. My coworkers kinda shrugged their shoulders at me but like I feel like a butt for losing my cool. Even my manager said ""I guess if you think it was justified then I don't know."" 


Also not sure if this is a valuable detial, or not but E does smoke, he uses it for seizers and for paranoia. But since he doesn't have a care he can go back to jail if its in his system."		1	0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
c1641k	2019-06-16 04:22:39	ericgro	AITA for helping somebody out a prom by taking his vape so he can get past security, but losing it to a teacher because he didn't come back to pick it up?	"Before you guys judge me based on the title, hear me out.

So some days ago I went to prom as a guest (I'm an international student from Germany in Canada btw)
After getting past security I got told that guests were allowed in couple hours later. 
So I went outside to go to a restaurant and I met this guy (let's call him Niklas) at the entrance.
(Niklas is also an international student from south america). He comes up to me and asks if I'm leaving. 
I replied with my plan and saying that I'll be back in a couple hours.
He asks me if I can take his vape so he can get past security (as we aren't allowed to have vapes).
(I just want to throw in that I don't know him well.)
So being nice to him I take his vape and we agree that he'll pick the vape up again once I'm back. 
After a couple hours I return and wait outside of the building. 
There were already teachers around organising the buses back to school and also some of my mates standing around. 
After half an hour or so he doesn't show up and the viceprincipal says that everybody will get checked on and then we'll join the grads on the party.
Being worried about not getting let in to the party I write Niklas that he needs pick up his vape asap. 
After 10 mins he still doesn't reply and I consulted with one of my mates what to do about the vape. 
We came to the decision to hide it in a nearby flower pot and I texted and send Niklas a picture of where I left his vape so he can pick it up. 
As we were walking to the security my mate noticed a teacher suspiciously looking at the pot where we left the vape. 
I hoped for the best and entered the security checking. 
During prom I started hearing that Niklas left early and in tears as he heard that one of his family members had died. 
As the party was almost over I went to check on the vape but it wasn't there anymore. 
The teacher from earlier took it. 

The next day Niklas messages me that he couldn't pick it up because he had to go.
He also asked me when he could pick up his vape.
I replied that his vape was taken by a teacher when I hid it.
He was very angry and he proceeded to have an argument with me.
My argument:I didn't know that he already left and he should have messaged me that he was leaving early and alsothat I didn't really had another choice as I didn't want to miss the prom party and I didn't have other options. 
Don't want to sound one-sided, but his arguments were: I was stupid for hiding it there and his family member died.

Recap: I took the vape for another student so he can get past security. 
He leaves early and doesn't let me know. I still think that he's at prom and wait outside. 
I hid the vape in a flower pot as the guests were also checked on. 
Vape got found by teacher and other student is now angry at me."	Everyone Sucks	0	0	141.0	88.0	0.0	0.0

Dad moved to The north and took me and my brother with him. After some time in the north, I decided to live with my mom for a bit in the south. She’s an bad person. My other brother is also a bad person. I battled a drug addiction in high school and met a wonderful girl who I thought was going to take my pain away.

Meanwhile my dad met someone and married her. She has a daughter who is 6 years older than I am, we spoke but weren’t incredibly close. 

This girl, who I probably would have spent the rest of my life with, got cancer. This all happened before 11th grade. Cancer, drugs, and bad environment was too much for me so I went back up north. The girl and I had a slight falling out but because we cared for each other we rekindled and is visit often. 

11th grade I bonded with my step sister. We got really really close. I don’t call her my step sister. Just sister.

I cut out my mom. My dad isn’t reliable and I don’t have a big amount of family so the only person I was able to turn to was my sister. Last year the girl passed away. My sister was there for me. She held me close and we just held each other on my bed for a while. She’s told me before I can’t push everything onto her and I try not to. Recently depression hit me really really hard and I tried to not reach out. She asked me to. She said “if it’s important and you really have no one to turn to reach out to me” so I did. 

I was trying to find a therapist so she wouldn’t be who I was laying everything on.

She knows I’ve been seeking therapy. 

One day she calls to talk. She says she’s going to pull her self further out of my life which blew me away. She says she’s not gonna call or text or anything for a month or two. I asked her what was going on and she tells me she has to focus on her life and that I’m overwhelming her again. I told her *shes* the one that asked to be let in on what was happening with me and that it’s not a good time to pull out because I really need her but she doesn’t listen. 

My sister left me like all my other family did. I called her one day. I texted her the next day “we need to talk” no responses. I thought about how incredibly hurt I am. How can she claim to love me when she tells me she wants to not talk anymore. I thought about it and texted her on Snapchat “we need to talk. I don’t want to text it but if that’s what it takes I will.” I was gonna say how hurt I was. She read it and didn’t respond. I want to text her how I’m feeling, and then essentially remove myself. She obviously doesn’t care and I don’t believe her when she said she loved me. I was hurt, but I feel like I moved on because most of my family has pulled away, so I’ve just thrown her into that group and started thinking of her that way. I’m now indifferent. I don’t think she would care if I sent it, but maybe she would, either way I feel like it’s best if I let her know how shitty she’s been."	Not enough info	0	0	1728.0	241.0	0.0	0.0

I haven't spoken to these neighbors very much other than giving their kids some balloon swords one time (I'm a balloon twister right now and i had quite a few to spare).

Today they began putting up a swing-set, that if you stand on it, you can see directly into my window, this makes me extremely uncomfortable as I wander around my house naked a lot.  They have quite a big yard (around 1500 square feet) and I saw that it's not a swing set that is placed in cement, it's a wooden one that could be moved with the help of a few people.

So I asked them in the nicest way I could possibly ask, if they would be able to/willing to move their swing-set 5 feet back.  Well they were really rude to me about it, but I just told them that I thought I should ask  and I hope that they have a good rest of their day, I don't remember the whole conversation so I wont try to quote it.  I did not mention the nudity bit as the neighbors had their kids helping them with their swing-set, and I didn't want to be inappropriate. My boyfriend acted like it was the end of the world and that I should have never gone over there in the first place, he doesn't like one of the people that live in that house due to an incident that he had with them about a month ago.

c15zoj	2019-06-16 04:07:52	justthatoboist	AITA for being mad at my friend for using photos of me for his disability themed final project?	"Bear with me here please. This fight happened a while ago but with family stuff and whatnot I just got around to posting it. 

So my friend and I signed up for a photography class at our high school for the spring semester. We’ve ALWAYS taken dumb photos of each other in joking manners. Whenever we hang out, the cameras come out as well. 

In January, a few weeks before the class began I fell extremely ill. I was in the hospital and needed medication that prevented severe permanent damage, although I will never regain full control of some muscles in my face. This gives me a crooked smile, a slight facial drool and also sometimes drooling if I’m tired. If I had been more delayed in getting this medication I could have ended up losing my ability to walk or even dying. 

Thankfully, neither of those things happened. Instead, I was on crutches for most of the semester and had braces on both my legs. I had always been an active person so the adjustment was harsh. My friend and I still took photos of each other. He helped me keep my life normal. 

Then comes the final project. For weeks he dodged telling me what the concept was. Finally, the teacher told me I was brave for working on him with his final and I was confused. He used photos he took of me all semester for a “living with disability” themed project. The photos put special emphasis on my braces and also showcased me smiling in photos I knew were being taken to show my facial droop and also photos I didn’t know he was taking that show other friends in the class helping me get around or in even one case wiping some drool from my face. 

I’m not mad that he took the photos, I’m mad at what he did with them. I now have two working legs that allow me to walk without assistance and minimal pain. My face is also recovering a lot more. My friend argues that he had the right to take the photos (he did) and make the project (this is where I’m mad). I’m angry at him for using me, for showcasing one part of me but also it claims me as disabled, when I’m not, at least not permanently. AITA for being mad?"	Not the A-hole	0	0	156.0	19.0	0.0	0.0
c15zcn	2019-06-16 04:06:44		AITA for abandoning the guy I like when he was depressed?	"A little backstory : He broke up with his former girlfriend of 5 years in June last year. He has since been depressed.

I started talking to him in December '18. We've been talking very frequently ever since. He calls me at least thrice a day on an average and I've liked him since the very beginning, something I also told him. He said he couldn't accept me nor reject me. I was fine with it though, because we had barely known each other and he obviously needed time to get over his ex. 
He spoke about his ex at times, which I again thought was completely fine and tried to help him out of it. I mean 5 years is no joke.

Lately though, everytime he brings up his ex, he wants me to confess to him to make him feel better. Eg: why do I like him so, etc. Been going on for a while, to be honest.

When it comes to our usual conversations, it's pretty fun and chilled, and he always says things he wouldn't have said if he hadn't liked me. He never says it directly but indirectly. So I had a feeling that he felt the same for me.

I confessed very recently, once again, because I really did think we were going somewhere. He however said that he really wasn't over his ex yet, and he could probably never like anybody else. He also told me that even now, 'there's no acception or rejection'. He might probably leave me hanging there till be finds another girl or something. As soon as he was done with that, he told me how depressed he was and asked me to tell him WHY it was that I liked him. AGAIN. And I quote, ""So that I can feel better"".

And I just thought that was extremely selfish. I really thought it was pointless going for him, and told him that I'd probably never see him again. After some time he says, 'Oh I'm almost out of the shit my ex left me with' (So I wouldn't stop talking and would try to pursue him). He also told me that I shouldn't stop talking to him until destiny says so, apparently. 
These just seem like excuses to me. He just wants to get over his ex and I'm the scapegoat.

And I stopped talking to him since.

Info: we’ve been dating for two years and we are currently long distance, we see each other on weekends. 

Based on what he’s told me on his day, he’s been sleeping extremely late and getting high at his friends house so he’s ended up waking at like 5 in the afternoon and even once woke up at like 7:30 and stayed up all night and day to “get back on a sleep schedule”. 

We’re moving in literally two days to go to college and we’re living together. I’ve been getting all our stuff together and organizing everything and from my POV, he’s literally doing nothing. He literally has nothing packed away. All he’s basically been doing is sleeping his day away and “because it’s late and I need to sleep” he gets high at his friends house because “weed makes you sleepy” but I know that weed keeps him up and just gives him the munchies. 

He has barely been talking to me as usual and he gets pissed at me when I yell at him through text about how he’s being lazy and doing nothing. 

In his defense, he did do some work, but I had to nag him to get him there. 

Today, he’s literally just been sleeping away and he just texted me to calm down and he’s starting to pack now. He hasn’t packed anything until the last minute and it stresses me out, so i get mad!

So am I the asshole?

He comes from a really good family, hasn't had to struggle a day in his life, and didn't know much about my history with my birth mom or how hard my childhood was. I decided to wait to tell him about all of this and first introduce him to my parents (I was adopted at ten by my aunt and her husband because my birth mom was a drug addict who was in and out of prison and dated abusive men). I figured I would wait until we'd been together for a few years, then I'd introduce him to my birth mom and the abuse and neglect I experienced when I lived with her. My birth mom found out that I introduced my SO to my parents and got super upset. she blasted me on social media, saying she only had one daughter and I was worthless, etc.  My  birth mom was known to spread rumors about me so I wasn't too concerned. 

I called my birth mom on the phone to explain and try to work things out. She then told me that I was a cold-hearted b**** and that's why my husband ran into the arms of another woman.  That for me was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I told her that would be the last conversation we ever had. It's been almost a year and despite her attempts to reconcile, I've kept my word.  I had no idea how much of my peace my birth mom was robbing me of until I cut her off. I'm so much happier and healthier. And I don't have to worry about her being verbally abusive to my kids. 

Over the past few months a few of my uncles and aunts have called me asking me to please talk to my birth mom again. They keep saying stuff like ""she's still your mom"" and ""God said honor your mother"" etc. Recently my sister spoke to me about it. She told me that my birth mom has been drug free for six months, prays for me and my forgiveness, she doesn't spread rumors anymore, and she actually got a job that she's pretty good at.  My sister told me that she is a different person and I should give her another chance.  I told her no.  My sister told me my birth mom cries when anyone mentions my name and asked me what my birth mom can do to be a part of my and my children's lives again. I told her absolutely nothing.  I found out that my birth mom has hepatitis, is on dialysis, and her health is in bad shape. My sister and several family members think I am being an Ahole. Am I in the wrong here?"
