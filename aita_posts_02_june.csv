Me (20M) and my gf (20F) just moved into our new apartment a few weeks ago from our parents' houses. We decided to throw a housewarming party with a few of our friends.

A few days ago, I met this girl at work who was a new hire. We talked for a bit, and the next day I invited her to our housewarming party. Me and my gf talked about it and set a date beforehand. 

Yesterday during conversation I learn her age is 16. The party will have 18+ type stuff, and I don't think she should come for her sake and ours.

WIBTA if I uninvited her from the party that's tomorrow?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bw6bbk	2019-06-03 03:55:03	zidanes33	AITA for asking my friend [28F] to quit her bad habits which resulted in her third miscarriage	"I have known this friend of mine for 14 years since secondary school times and she has been an avid drinker and smoker ever since 16 years old.

&#x200B;

when she turned 24 she got married, she shared with me that she intends to try for a baby, me as a friend advised her multiple times to quit her smoking and drinking as it has been shown that it will increase the chances of miscarriage.

&#x200B;

As expected during her first two pregnancy she did not heed my advices and she would continue to drink and smoke as how she likes, claiming that she needs these to de-stress herself from her job and i advised her that there are other healthier means of de-stressing other than smoking and drinking, but all advise given were ignore and both pregnancy ended up in miscarriage.

&#x200B;

Finally the third time she got pregnant, i told her to please stop doing harm to both you and the baby and stop all smoking and drinking. i even asked my wife who is a nurse to send me those reserach articles that have proven that smoking and drinking reduces the chance of a successful pregnancy.

&#x200B;

But she ignored my advice the third time and continued with her vices, literally at this point i have given up and stop giving her advise, as expected the third pregnancy is unsuccessful and it became a miscarriage again.

&#x200B;

After knowing she had a third miscarriage, my friend decided to start blasting me saying that its all my fault that i have caused her to miscarriage, blocked me off on all social media, told all my friends that i caused her miscarriage, causing some of my friends to block me off as well.

bw6baa	2019-06-03 03:54:56	alymaysay	AITA for ghosting a guy I am in debt to?	"So I posted this once but apparently was too wordy. Try #2. About a year ago I found myself underemployed and with small kids and no options...we were living in hotels...i decided to post on seeking arrangements. No I'm not a prostitute. I met a few different lonely men that I would spend time with. Movie and dinner..long talks..phone conversations things like this in exchange for financial help.
I met this guy that really wanted to go above and beyond. And we clicked so he became a friend more so than anyone else. He would do nice things like insist on getting me groceries, taking myself and 3 small children on vacation (even after I told him I couldn't afford it and he said not to worry he would cover it). He even advanced me 1500 to get into an apartment.
Fast forward to vaca. I had fallen asleep mid day napping with my little one's after a long day exploring the forest. I woke to about 30 texts. Starting with what's up and ending with ""you stupid whore...you ruined this..you'll pay"" I talked him off the ledge but it really scared me. After that he decided that I owed him for not only the vacation but also any""gifts"" he had ever bought. I agreed and decided I would trade my company and time for my debt but not accept any more ""gifts"".
A week ago he was supposed to come visit. Last minute I had a family emergency and told him I couldn't join him until later. Again he went off the deep end. Coming to my house, blowing up my phone, my email and threatening to essentially ruin my life if I didn't spend time with him. I eventually agreed to see him tomorrow. But he has kept up his craziness and blowing up my phone. Id be lying if I said he doesn't scare me. WIBTA if I cut all ties and didn't hold up my end? I know you're gonna go for the jugular...hit me Reddit...
Update: I did ghost him. The texts stopped as well as emails and kiks. He did send one last ""at least I dont have to live with myself after this"" message but that was it. I'm now in a state of cautiously waiting and lying low. Hoping this Isn't the calm before the psycho storm. Thanks for all of your great Reddit advice!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bw6abb	2019-06-03 03:51:57	marchingGazelle	AITA to say no to my ex who wants to visit me?	"So background: We dated for about 10 months last year and then we both graduated college and she decided to go back to her home country which is in a different continent. About a year ago this time we had an argument during our already shaky relationship and decided mutually that it was time to part ways. (She did end up blocking me and resenting me for it). Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved her throughout the relationship, but there were times when she'd be very paranoid about me when I hung out with my tennis club (mostly female), and I partly understand that, but tennis wasn't something I was gonna give up.
Since the breakup we've talked twice, about 3ish months ago, and today - a few hours ago.
I really enjoyed today's conversation, if felt like old times, we made jokes, we talked about our mutual friends, we talked about coffee and wine and our new apartments and a whole lot more.
Towards the end of it suddenly became a QnA session where she asked me more about my current love life, work and all. I consider her a good friend even though we're not together and so be honest about everything.
The very last question she asked was, ""If I saved enough money to fly to you, to be with you, will you see me?""
I was very hesitant at answering this question initially since I was still in the smiley mood of reliving old memories and wanted it, but then slowly I remembered the stress and nights I cried after the breakup and how I'm doing better emotionally and mentally and definitely didn't want to fuck it up.
So I told her, that if she was a to fly all the way here for tourism or to visit friends (I made sure to mention a couple mutual friends), then I'd take the time to meeet her. But if she's flying solely to meet and rekindle lost Sparks, then it wouldn't be worth the financial and emotional trip since I wasn't wanting to entertain that.
She then later starts, calmly but rudely, saying a few names and how I was selfish of caring about my needs and not hers, and if someone was ready to fly over the Atlantic, most people would do anything to see them.
I kept quiet because I didn't know what to say. And then she said sorry that she didn't mean that and said I should just consider about having her over for a month and hang out like old times. I got some composure back and just said, ""No, I'd prefer we not meet if the sole reason of you flying over is to meet me.""
It was pretty much silence after that, and we said our goodbye.
Part of me feels guilty for turning her down, I mean it's not easy to maintain long distance and ready to get the bank out to fly to and fro. But I also know that I'm fine being single right now, it gets lonely but I enjoy my personal space.

bw6a6d	2019-06-03 03:51:33		WIBTA for moving out at 18 due to my mother and sister?	Hi, everyone. There’s a character limit on this subreddit (may even be on all of reddit, I’m not a frequent text poster.) I can go into anything in detail you’d like in the comment section. I’m wondering if I’d be the asshole if I moved out of my mothers house. If you’ve ever been on the subreddits about narcissists and just strange parenting, that is my mom. She is fairly wealthy, she makes $400 an hour- we are upper middle class. There is so much I can explain but I’ll sum it up with major secrets, emotional damage, mental illnesses, and unfair treatment. This is from both my mom and my sister. My best friend said I could live with him until college. The reason I feel like an asshole is because I’m still in some ways dependent on my mother. Medication (ADHD and depression- hint: mainly caused by my mom and my sister), and finances for college. Not all of it, but some of it. A significant amount. We have some really good days and some really horrible days. I just think it’s best for both of our mindsets. I’m moving into college in August. The reason I feel like an asshole is because she’s done so much for me and when she isn’t experiencing the bad side of her bipolar disorder she is great. But there is some things I can’t forgive and I’d rather I’m out of her hair, for both of our sakes, but it KILLS me because I don’t drive, don’t have a job yet, but I just can’t stand being in this house. This gorgeous, large house. I feel ungrateful but I feel it’s justified. Next move is getting a job whether I’m moving to my friends or not just for the sake of being around her less and having money. Like, hey, you make me feel horrible and give me daily panic attacks so I’m moving into my friends but thanks for paying more than half of my dream schools tuition? Is this just an angsty teen fantasy? I don’t know. Lmk what you think.		1	0
bw69sq	2019-06-03 03:50:25		AITA for smoking weed?	"Using a throwaway because I’m really embarrassed that I ever have to ask this question. 

So I’m currently in my junior year of college, studying to be a teacher. I absolutely love my future profession, love working with kids, and I’m really excited for a long and rewarding career in education. I’m also a really good student, always getting A’s and B’s and I’ve been on the dean’s list almost every term since I declared my major. I work two jobs and participate actively in two different extracurriculars. What I’m saying is that by every outward standard, I appear to have my shit together. 

But...I smoke weed. A lot of weed. As in, pretty much every day after I’m done with class/work/activities. I find it relaxing and helpful for my anxiety and chronic pain, and I can think of no better lazy Sunday than smoking a bowl and curling up in bed. Part of it is social too, as I often smoke with my best friend or a small circle of friends. I never get high before class/work and I always make sure to have excellent hygiene so I don’t stink of pot (change clothes after I smoke, shower if I can and wash up as much as possible if I can’t, brush my teeth thoroughly, etc after smoking). I’d also argue that I don’t have a dependency, as I’ve been able to quit multiple times without any difficulty or temptation, although I *do* some pretty much every day. 

Recently I told a less close friend in confidence about my drug use, and she reacted really negatively. Said I was a stoner and throwing my life away, and that I will make a terrible teacher as I am a poor role model. On the one hand, she was a dick about it and that makes me think she’s TA, but on the other hand I *do* use weed very frequently to the point where other people might think I have a problem, even if I prioritize my school, work, and social obligations over weed. I can see how this might translate negatively into a career where I deal with kids (and again, I stress that I have never and will never go to work under the influence, as I see it akin to going to work drunk). I also live in a state where weed is technically still illegal, but decriminalized. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bw69o1	2019-06-03 03:50:00	Mudkio	AITA for refusing to drive my mom’s cousins around while they’re on vacation and being mad at my parents for letting them stay in my room?	"Two of my mom’s cousins (who I have never met before nor heard about until very recently) are coming to stay with my family in our house for their vacation. In addition to this, they are staying in my room and I’m forced to either sleep with my parents or sleep in our house’s living room extension  which lacks air conditioning. It gets extremely hot where I live, but I’m also 19 years old (M) and value my privacy. I just had ended my first year in college with three roommates so I really was looking forward to my own room. I already have to share the room with my brother and we alternate between sleeping in the living room and in our bedroom due to conflicting sleep schedules and the fact that he stays up playing video games super late and I tend to go to bed much earlier so I’m honestly pretty upset with this overall situation.

My dad recently told my brother and I that he would like us to drive my mom’s cousins to different places around town while they’re here. I’ve refused to do this due to the sentiments above and told them that I wouldn’t be their “personal chauffeur.” When I asked how long they were staying, my mom wouldn’t give a definite answer because apparently her cousins aren’t that good at communication and don’t give concrete answers. She says that whenever she asks them anything, it’s just a “one question, one answer” response and that’s just how this cousin is. This makes me even more upset as I believe it’s rude for them to just come on the same day without us knowing all of the details of how long, when they’re arriving, etc.. 

This situation has caused my parents and I to fight and has made us all really stressed. Am i just being an entitled a-hole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw69kp	2019-06-03 03:49:41	lauren__95	WIBTA if I tell my friends their Colombian dad (M55?) kissed me (F24)?	" I visited TN b/c my 2 friends’(K and V F27,M28) wedding. K & sis S(F32) live in parents' guest house. I stayed in an empty room in their parents' house Thurs-Sat, as did V's parents. I’d met K&S’ parents, but it was my 1st time meeting V’s parents. Due to the various celebrations at K’s parents’ house, I spent a lot of time w/ both K and V’s parents. B/c it was a hectic time, I helped set up and clean up after.

Throughout the weekend, I’d been talking about my upcoming trip to S. America, and K and V’s parents showed concern as I’ll be traveling alone. V’s parents grew fond of me and wanted to make sure we keep in touch. They told me they love me & hoped I’d invite them to my graduation & future wedding. Similarly, K’s parents told me several times I’m always welcome in their house and they loved having me. “I’m part of the family.” K and V left early on Sun morning to head off to their honeymoon. I stayed w/ their families in the house b/c there was a party late Sat night & I had a 4 hour drive to get to the airport.

On Sun morning, I spent more time w/ K’s family. I had breakfast w/ them and helped S out w/ things around the house. I said goodbye to K&S’ parents and left for the airport. I realized I’d forgotten my backpack so I called S to tell her I needed to return. She said OK b/c her dad was there. Later, she told me that her dad left, but the house was unlocked in case V’s parents returned. I arrived to the house & was surprised to see K&S’ dad. He said he returned b/c I was coming back. I got my bag and said bye to him again. He asked to exchange #s to make sure I’m safe. (didn’t think anything b/c V’s mom gave me her # to keep in touch) He hugged me several times inside & outside and was teary when I was leaving. He was concerned for my travels and asked how I was funding them. Then, he offered me money to help w/ the cost. I told him no but he insisted b/c he was worried I’d run out of money. I went back inside. He motioned to come up to his office. He handed me $100. I said that was too much and not necessary. He kept holding my hand & hugging me. It felt like he was going to kiss my lips, so I turned to give him my cheek. (when I greet or say bye to this family, I do an air kiss & touch cheeks) But he tried again to kiss me. Afraid of being culturally insensitive, I didn’t swerve his 2nd attempt. It was obvious I was uncomfortable, but I thought perhaps this was normal practice w/ Colombian men & their daughters (or people that are “like a daughter”). He asked me if I was okay & said I was beautiful, as I started to head out as I should “leave before it’s too dark.” He stood outside watching me leave. I waved to him, but made sure to not let him hug me again.

It felt weird, and I wanted to ask K/S if it’s cultural, but I don’t know how they’d react. I thought about asking V’s opinion 1st, but my sis R(F44) thinks that V might defend his new FIL & make things awkward."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw69b4	2019-06-03 03:48:57		AITA Someone called me racist	"When I was in the hospital, there where all these other girls. Some of which I was friends with, and some who I stayed away from. 

I was sitting with my friends and we where talking, and there was this one nurse who was from Africa. She was sweet, but that day, she was following me around ALOT. Me and my friends thought it was funny, so we started making jokes about her (not meaning to be rude of course). 

As part of the joke, I was imitating her accent and some of the weird things she said to me, cause I was trying to be funny, and everyone laughed. But then this one girl yelled at me to stop (the girl who called me racist). Then me and my friends gave her a dirty look, and walked away.

Later on, the bitch had the NERVE to call me racist in front of a shit ton of people. But I called her out, stood up for myself, and alotta people where on my side and not hers. 

Like I NEVER did anything to her and now she's being ignorant asf. But I think she's just sensitive.

Not to mention, people in my previous hospital made jokes like that too. And they're not racist. I was mad about it at first, but later on, I didn't really care cause I know that I am not a racist and that she was wrong. But I wanna know your guys opinion.

bw68pj	2019-06-03 03:46:58	Junior_City	AITA for ghosting my best friend because he kept saying the n-word?	"For reference, the n word I’m referring to is “nigga”. 

&#x200B;

So in high school, I really didn’t care that much when people say the n-word. I think it’s because I went to school in a predominantly white area with probably 5 black people out of the 800 kids in my grade. So my friend Cameron pretty much hard it in his vocabulary for a while and I didn’t care that much. 

&#x200B;

I’m 21 and in the 4th year of college. Things have changed since I was a high schooler, and I started associating the word with the negative history behind it. I go to school far from home now, so I only see Cameron during vacations. 

&#x200B;

Well when hanging out with him, he just said it in casual conversation. Not in a derogatory way or anything, but I still felt uncomfortable. I told him “hey bro, I’m not really comfortable with white people using the word anymore.” He kinda looked at me perplexed and said “that’s kinda dumb, I mean it the same way how I always mean it.” I told him that’s true, but the way I felt about it as changed. I just don’t like white people using the word. He rolled his eyes and replaced the n-word with this “person” and I thought that was the end

&#x200B;

Well in the next week, I’ve heard him say it three times, the first two times in a song and the next conversing with a buddy while I’m in the car. I was going to let the song ones slide, but after the buddy one, I decided this friendship is probably not for me. He dropped me off, and I haven’t really talked to him since. He’s invited me to hang several times and I just made excuses for each. I also left all the group chats he was in. 

&#x200B;

After a few days, he asked “hey bro what’s up? You seem to not wanna chill.” I told him it’s not him it’s me, I just think we’ve changed and I don’t really want to be friends anymore. He asked what I meant and I specified the n-word thing. He felt hurt I’d end a multi-year friendship over “a word” and that he was trying.  I said “look man, I’m just not comfortable with white people saying the word; I’m not the whose changed, not you, but I just find it disrespectful now and I don’t really want to associate with white people who use it in casual conversation. I don’t want to police your vocabulary so I think it’s just better this way”. I then blocked him.

&#x200B;

So, my dad died from kidney cancer about a year and a half ago. My mom has been a stay at home farm mom since before I was born, and the years following she was taking care of my grandma until she died of kidney cancer, and then my dad until he died. Basically, she has been doing nothing but taking care of cancer patients for the last ten years. The woman is an absolute saint, but she hasn't has a 'real' job since the 90's.

Now, my dad left us with a LOT of debt. My mom always let him handle all of the financials, and those last few years of him drugged out of his mind on painkillers was him taking out loans to keep the farm afloat and signing our life away to the bank. ""Not of sound mind"" doesn't even begin to cover it and we didn't find out about most of it until after he was gone. Ever since he died, we (my mom, me, and my older brother and sister) have been slowly getting closer to losing the farm. My sister and BIL moved in with my mom, and my brother is also married. I'm in college. Most of what my brother and sister make go to paying the bank, and I do what I can.

A year and a half later and not much has changed aside from being more in debt, and now my sister has a six month old kid. I also have a bunch of ER bills to pay for myself, and a shoulder surgery at the end of the summer that I have to pay out of pocket because my insurance sucks.

&#x200B;

After all of this my mom is still contributing nothing financially. She has essentially turned herself into a free babysitting service for my sister, and alternates between apologizing for not being able to do more and making me feel guilty. I'm close with my brother and we've talked about it before , and he agrees that something needs to change. He doesn't want to disturb the peace though and won't say anything. My sister and I don't get along very well and I'm pretty sure she enjoys her free babysitting services. My mom is still pretty fragile emotionally and struggles with depression. There isn't a good way to put it lightly, because she won't react to anything short of a kick in the ass. I also live over an hour away, whereas my brother and sister are right there all the time helping. Really, I'm probably coming out of this the best as far as dealing with the aftermath of the farm. 

&#x200B;

I've been trying to get up the courage to bring it up next time I see her, which is maybe once or twice a month. Nobody else in the family wants to do it, and I know they will all jump to defend her even if they agree. I'm going to be essentially ostracizing myself from the family, but I think it's worth it if it helps my mom in the end. It's partially her fault for not paying better attention to the financials anyway. In other words, am I the asshole for visiting for a weekend, telling my mom to get a job and stop wallowing, and leaving again?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bw6271	2019-06-03 03:27:06		WIBTA If I told my dad to go fuck himself for hounding me about a sandwich I forgot to bring for him that I promised.	Now I know what you’re thinking “OP is definitely a fucking asshole.” Let me establish something. I’m a 17 year old with no car so I solely rely on my mother for transport to work. And today I worked from 2-closing, and it took us ages to close due to the morning team not fulfilling their responsibilities. And before I went to work I told my father who constantly hounds me to bring him a free sandwich “I don’t get free sandwiches, if you give me $5 I’ll buy you one and bring it when I get home.” Now here’s where it gets funky. Today we got hit insanely hard, dishes piling to the ceiling, out of quarters, and dollar bills, manager on the verge of pulling her hair out, etc etc. And after finally getting everyone out of the store we had to finally prep and clean so we could leave. I had to wash over 100 pots and pants, about 60 tongs and knives, sweep and mop, and clean the bathroom in an hour and 30 minutes. While doing all this my mother BLOWS up my phone telling me hurry the hell up, and I’m going to have to quit if I ever take this long again. And when I’m finishing up mopping the bathroom she texts me “I’m leaving in 5 mins hurry up.” So I literally spray some air freshener in the bathroom, tell my manager about what’s happening and run out the building to my moms car. And the first thing I notice is fuck I forgot the sandwich. I text him “I completely forgot your food due to mom rushing me, don’t blame her as it’s entirely my fault and I should’ve paid more attention I’m sorry.” And he responds with “Fuck it I don’t care you made me wait all this time for food I can’t even get today, I gave my dinner away because I was expecting you to bring me something.” I then respond with “I’m sorry please forgive me, I’ll make it up to you and bring you a 12 inch and a fry tomorrow, and make you dinner when I get home.” He doesn’t respond until I get home and tells me to get the fuck out of his face, and I should’ve used that fucking big head of yours. But I completely understand his anger and make him a burger and fries and give him $5(the amount he gave me.) and he tells me to get the fuck out of his face he doesn’t want it, he has to get some sleep before work. And this is where the question comes in. If I tell him to eat a fucking dick and leave me alone the next time he brings it up (tomorrow morning) will I be in the wrong?	Not the A-hole	1	0

I made a Craigslist lost and found ad and haven’t seen any response. I also pulled the SIM card and put it in an old phone to find the number. It turns out it’s the phone of a local businessman who lives a few blocks over. To make a long story short , I tracked him down and found his Facebook and messaged him to say that I found his phone and yadayada. 

It’s been almost a week and I haven’t heard a response. Is it wrong if I unsend my messages and just keep it ? 

Giving it back would be useless because it’s so destroyed that there’s no way he could ever get any data back and I doubt he lacks the knowledge to replace the screen. If i kept it I would fix it if possible and use it in place of my phone. I’m so torn. I’m urgently trying to decide so I can order parts and try to fix it but I’m not fixing it if there’s a possibility it goes back to him.

Edit: I know where he lives,yes. But I’m going to come off as some creepy stalker if I drop it off there because I had to do some real detective work to find his address in the first place. I don’t know him personally nor through a friend, not at all in fact.

Edit again: Thank you all for setting me straight and opening my eyes to my selfishness. I returned the phone to a very happy previous owner, I was able to track him down and get a hold of him through a friend of a friend who just so happened to know him. Even though I didn’t get a reward (and never expected one) the million thanks and smile he gave me reminded me why it’s always good to do the right thing. Thanks again everyone :)"	Asshole	0	0

However she recently accepted a different job with a later start date and I was stoked we could all have the full day together. We didn't actually have this conversation, I had assumed that'd be the plan. 

However tonight she told me she'd be busy from the morning until 5pmish because she'll be going dress shopping with the bride to be.

His preschool normally would take place until around 3, but they didn't have class last week due to the crazy tornadoes that hit our area and I'm unsure if he'll have class tomorrow or not. 

I'm pretty upset to the point I don't want to talk to her. If he has preschool then she won't really miss out too much if she's not late, but I guess I was hoping she'd reserve the day for this sort of thing seeing as she's going to be his stepmom. AITA?"	Asshole	1	0
bw5xql	2019-06-03 03:13:58	JellyFishieey	AITA for wanting to get sterilized when my husband wants to have more children?	"Okay sorry guys So sorry if  this is a bit long
I met my husband when I was around 16 and we have pretty much been together since, we always talked about growing up getting married and having lots and lots of babies. Flash forward a couple years  we’re married I’m a pre school teacher who ADORES kids and  husband has a good career and we’re ready to start our family! And this is where everything for me changes. It took us almost 2 years to get pregnant, so many failed pregnancy tests and disappointment feeling like something was wrong with me practically begging to have a baby when all my friends are around me having babies getting pregnant without even trying! It was disheartening to say the very least and I became depressed. Then came the day I FINALLY got pregnant! Initially I was over the moon but reality settled in fast. 
I. Was. MISERABLE.  It was not and easy pregnancy at all. Anyhow now I have a baby boy who I love very much but I absolutely have no desire to have any more children or become pregnant ever again.  I have told my husband who is already talking about having another (my babe is only 6months) that’d I’d be open to adoption later but I do NOT want to be pregnant, I’m traumatized. I quite literally have nightmares about becoming pregnant and every time we have sex I have a panic attack about my birth control not working so much so that we hardly have sex. Anyways I told my husband I want to get sterilized as it’s the only way I think I’ll have my sanity back but he is not a fan of the idea. He keeps telling me “you’ll change your mind someday we’re still really young” and things of that nature but I really won’t.  I’m pretty sure he’s even talked to his family about it (I’m only assuming this as they’ve been really pushy about “when’s the next one coming “ or “are you hoping for a girl next time” comments like that) but anyways, I confided in some friends and my mom about it and everyone seems to be on his side saying “ you knew he wanted a lot of kids you’re not thinking about his feelings” well so did I but that was before and this is now. I hate that everyone is making me feel like I’m taking something away from my husband when we have a perfectly wonderful baby right now. So back to my question am I the asshole here is this a selfish thing to do? 
Note: I had ppd and I am medicated for it it dies not make these feelings of anti birthing go away.


EDIT: I guess in my emotional state last night I didn’t make it clear that my husband is a super loving man and kind man and I don’t personally feel attacked by him (though  I do by his family), I don’t think he’s intentionally guilt tripping me it just happens that the way he feels makes me feel bad. He does try to understand but as of now he just keeps hoping for me to say what he wants to hear and I think that in this situation that’s okay"	Not the A-hole	0	0

AITA

This is something that happened when I was a kid and it's stuck with me since, I don't remember how old I was. Throwaway for privacy

Lots of backstory. I am the youngest in my family and have always had to share. Even if I didn't want to. Didn't get a choice and never had many personal items and what I did have were second hand items. My siblings and mother were often terrible borrowers often returning items dirty, gross, broken, or not at all.

My mother has a lot of problems. Bipolar and refusing treatment/medication. Emotionally and verbally abusive to everyone in my family. Severe issues with hygiene, where she wouldn't bathe for a month or two, at least. SAHM but never did any chores, would leave messes wherever she goes, clogging the toilet (deny it was her and leave it for the next person). Also an alcoholic. I could go on forever.

I liked to save up my own money from birthdays and holidays. I wanted to buy something for myself online. First online purchase, dad had to help me set up PayPal. It sounds silly but I always wanted steampunk goggles, and decided to getting them.

Fast forward to when they arrive. They come and my mom gets her hands on them first. She opens the package and puts them on her head. I didn't even get to touch them yet and they are on her unwashed, greasy, dandruff-y head. I am stunned. I try not to talk back because it always ends poorly but I snap. I don't say anything but I quickly pull them off her head. There is a pause and then she freaks out, saying that I hurt her, that I'm a psychopath, I'm mean. She's crying and yelling (think toddler having a tantrum level of hysterics, there is no nicer way to describe it). I decide to say nothing and just back off and go into another room.

I try to figure out if I actually was too forceful. The goggles are now greasy but there was no hair or anything to suggest that I may have accidentally pulled her hair. All the while my mom is still crying and screaming, calling me a psycho. Eventually my dad comes home from work and is confronted with the situation. He helps my mom calm down and talk to me about what happened. He really diffused the situation and helped me feel like I wasn't a little psychopath. He also understood how much these goggles meant to me in principle. 

I apologized and she gave a non-apology. My feelings were pushed under the rug because she likes to use the ""i am your mother therefore I can ignore your personal boundaries"" a lot. She still brings it up every once and a while as one of the most hurtful things I have ever done."		1	0
bw5x4x	2019-06-03 03:12:09	Poppinbrownguy	AITA for not apologizing over something that happened 7~ years ago?	"So I met up with one of my best friends yesterday and we were just sitting around bullshittng as usual. He says he has something important to ask me so I tell him to shoot. 

He asks me if I remember a time where me, him, and two other friends were in high school sitting by the library just hanging out. There were plenty of instances like that with those two specific people so I wasn’t sure what he was referring to. He describes the incident as we were goofing around and he jumped on my back, I flipped/jumped and both of us hit the ground...kind of like a fake wrestling move.  I don’t remember the specific incident but that’s how he describes it. He asked me to apologize for it and honestly, I thought he was joking. I kind of laughed and then I saw he was serious. I told him that I don’t remember the specific instance and that I wasn’t going to apologize for something that a) I didn’t remember and b) something that happened when we were roughly 16/17 years old. He seemed to get annoyed and he left after only 5 minutes of stepping out to hang out with me. 

I didn’t think too much of it so I jokingly texted him (every text is exactly as it’s written, there’s no paraphrasing or nothing) “so did you get over it” and he responded “pieces of shit ask if somebody gets over something instead of apologizing” 

That honestly got me mad and I texted back “bruh, I’m not going  to apologize for something that I don’t even remember” 

He responded “you don’t need to apologize and I don’t need to acknowledge you before you do”

honestly, I was getting really pissed off because of how irrational he was being but I kept my cool and said “why are you giving me an ultimatum and getting upset over something that isn’t even relevant in our lives, which leads me to believe that there’s subsequently a deeper rooted issue that you’re not talking about and are instead giving me an ultimatum into apologizing for something that I don’t even remember” 

He didn’t respond and knowing him, he probably won’t respond until I give him an apology. I admit, I have said some dumb things as a teenager to him regarding race and other racist jokes (I’m Pakistani, he’s black) but again, that was also at least 6 years ago. I long then since apologized for him for anything offensive I may have said so I’m in no means above apologizing for my bad behavior or for when I’m in the wrong. I just don’t understand the relevance of him bringing up something so long ago, being irrational, and acting as if it happened yesterday. 

To me, the flip thing doesn’t even seem like an issue and it seems like there’s a deeper rooted cause but I opened the door for him to talk about it and he refused. 

AITA?

Edit: I apologized for asking if he got over it. Told him that I couldn’t in good conscience apologize for something like this."	Asshole	0	0

She loves Trader Joe's (a specialty supermarket with fun snacks and cheap specialty items that are only found at that store, for those of you outside the US), but she has to take a 20 min train to get there, so she always texts me asking if I can pick up this or that for her the next time I'm there. She really doesn't seem to get that even though I have a car, it's still annoying for me to have to remember to get her items, search for them in the aisles, pay for them separately, get two separate bags, go to her apartment or wait for her to come to mine to grab the stuff, and deal with the payback, and she rarely offers anything in return. But honestly it's not a huge deal, it's just a bit irritating in principle. She does this about once a month, and I've started to ignore her texts and go there almost in secret, but I feel a bit selfish because realistically it is more annoying to get there by train and she only asks for like 2-4 items at a time (though sometimes they're heavy things like drinks).

bw5vo4	2019-06-03 03:07:53	Eiram_Johnson	AITA For Snapping at this lady and potentially body shaming her daughter?	" 

So today while at a short trip to Walmart i found myself in an uncomfortable situation. While in the self check out cash register I over heard a mother and a daughter arguing.Some information that will be useful further on this story: I am a heavier female, I am also recently pregnant, The mother is fairly young around her early 30's and is average weight, not too skinny and not too heavy, the daughter who is about 13 years old is wearing some fairly tight booty shorts and a tank top that looked like she was wearing it since last year before her growth spurg, she was a little on the bigger side and you could tell that she was starting to fill in. The argument went something like this:

Daughter: Mom pleaseee pleasee pleaseee can i get some chocolate?!

Mother: No, we have enough snacks here you can have something when we get home

Daughter: But we don't have any chocolate please can I just have one and we can share

Mother: (Sounding more frustrated now) I said no so stop asking.

Daughter: (Sounding desperate and ready to cry) Mom please please please here we can get reasees that's your favorite type of chocolate, ill just have one and you can have the rest.

Mother: (Pulling in her daughter close) Stop asking me for candy all the damn time, you keep eating candy like that and you gonna end up looking like her. (Pointing at me)

I turned around trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and understanding she's trying to make a point to her daughter at the expense of my body image, which i don't condone but i'm not going to hop into someone else's parenting bandwagon, but when I turn around all the way to meet her gaze I can tell she was making sure i heard, like a personal vendetta and mind you i don't know this woman, i have never seen her or her daughter in my life.

Me: Excuse me? (I waited for a few seconds for an I'm sorry or something but she just looked at me like i was dumb or something so i continued) I'll have you know I am actually 5 months pregnant (I'm not that far along but i thought id use it at my advantage to make her feel somewhat bad for talking about someones body)

She then rolled her eyes at me and said ""So?"" like i just meddled in her conversation and it was my fault if my feelings got hurt so i kinda snapped.

Me: Well you're absolutely right, they way your daughter keeps going and how you're dressing her she will most definitely end up like me, PREGNANT!

She looked appalled for a good moment but she didn't anything else other than give me really nasty side eye, I already had my groceries bagged and loaded in my cart to I went ahead and swiped my card and walked away without checking if the transaction went through fine or without grabbing the receipt, while I'm walking away i hear what I think is the girl crying, almost bawling hysterically, I didn't bother to look back, i was steamed and i just wanted out of the whole situation

bw5vfv	2019-06-03 03:07:11	winterwoods	AITA for not changing my schedule?	"TL;DR: my bf wants me to change my schedule to match his so that we are both off work at the same times. 

When I met my boyfriend three years ago, we both stayed up late and slept late. It worked for each of us and it worked for us as a couple. About a year and a half ago, he got a different job and started work standard 8 to 5 days. 

Now, I still sleep late and work in the afternoon/evening like i have always done. I work at home and can work any hours i want, and this is what is most comfortable for me. 

The problem is that he is upset that i still have to work at night sometimes instead of spending time with him. We do not live together, it just randomly frustrates him that I'm still working at night sometimes when we're texting. If i have to work on a weekend, it's a whole blow up fight. 

He thinks that since i have the flexibility to change my hours and he does not, i should start getting up early like him so that I'm done working when he is off work. But that's very hard for me as I struggle with insomnia and can't just go to sleep at midnight like he can and does. 

I say I'm not the one who changed, he is, and now he's demanding that I change my hours to conform to his new ones. Okay, what do you say? Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bw5ubu	2019-06-03 03:03:44		AITA if I decide not to let my cousin live with us anymore because he decided to start smoking weed again when we are in a bad financial situation?	"Just to clarify: I’m 19F, and my cousin is 18M(just turned 18 in April). I spoke with my mom about this and she had no problem with it(since she hates the smell of weed + doesn’t support it at all).

I just found out my cousin started smoking again last month, but he claimed he quit. I saw a snap of him saying “I’m high af” from a couple of hours ago. I have no problem with weed, it’s just that we are not financially stable enough to get extra food for him.

Why does it bother me? Because my mom, cousin, and I all need jobs , and we plan on moving soon. I’m tired of my mom doing everything and I’ve been trying to get another job since I turned 18(I’ve only had one). But, it’s been extremely hard to get one, it’s been a year and I still haven’t gotten another job. It’s driving me crazy, I’m tired of being broke and being called useless. The only friend I had in this area, I had to cut ties with because he was making fun of my financial situation.

Anyways back to the whole point of this post. We are trying to move out around August or September. But it’s pretty annoying that he has started going back to his old habits of smoking weed, KNOWING that we need to save money for the move, and that my mom can’t afford to pay extra $$ on food because of him. Not only that, but my cousin knows damn well every job down here gives you a drug test(if you got the job). Which makes me think he’s going to freeload this entire time, and when we move. We all had planned to get jobs and save up money for the 16 hour drive, 1 hotel we stop at, and the fees+rent for our new home, and he’s ruined it. 

I wish I could go into more detail about him but this post is already long enough as is. 

Side note: my mom receives retirement once a month and we are relying on that. 

So, AITA if I decide to kick him out or send him back with his mom if he doesn’t get his act up by the time we move? 

TDLR: My cousin started smoking weed again, and we can’t afford to waste more money on food because of his excessive hunger. We all need jobs and now that he’s smoking, it will take longer for us to save money. Debating on not letting him stay with us any longer if he doesn’t grow tf up."		1	0

I usually leave home before she leaves for the day and come back after she has returned. And she is pretty much having her run of the house. We live in a two bedroom one bathroom townhouse. 

I usually try to stay opposite level of the house from her because I do not relate to her whatsoever. She is much younger than me and we just don’t mesh. 

I brought up to my brother after a month of her being here almost daily and nightly that she should start contributing to bills if she is going to sleep, shower, eat, use internet, cable. The works.

One important staff member has a weird surgery, and then has complications, all or which seem legit although I haven't seen a doctor's note (side wibta for asking for doctor's notes going forward which I already know the answer to), now it feels like no end in sight. Every day is a maybe tomorrow type of answer. I feel like I am reaching out way too much to see if they will be coming in and while I really like the employee, and feel that they also feel bad on top of not feeling well health wise, I am not able to run a business effectively without help. Hiring and trainibg someone new is time consuming and costly but I'm also worried that if I don't I may be digging a deeper hole if this continues.  Would I be the asshole if when/if the employee comes back, someone else has their job? We're at 4 weeks with a short time back that was probably too soon as they had more complications.

A few days before my 20th birthday, March 14th, my stepfather and I got into a bit of a spat. He asked me an offensive and invasive question that I'd already begrudgingly answered the hear before, and he prefaced it saying ""You're not going to like this"". I didn't insult him or anything, I just said ""I'm not gonna take that question"".

  


After that, he flipped out, screaming about how I never take responsibility for anything, I have no empathy for anyone, etc. He kept telling me to leave, because he was having a breakdown. I told him I wasn't going to leave, just for us to calm down. I didn't raise my voice at any point, never called him names or anything.

  


He threatened to call the police on me. I did not bother fighting him on it, which he afterward claimed was me saying ""So call the police"", despite me never saying anything along those lines. He stormed upstairs and actually did it.

  


I walked upstairs and got my shoes on, they told him he had to legally evict me in order to get rid of me. He flipped out, went on about how I ""had him by the balls"", how I'd spend my birthday in jail and ""that will be your present"".

  


Over the course of the next two or three days, he just kept harassing me over it all. Telling me my pregnant mother was getting stressed about our conflict, and if she had another miscarriage, it would be completely my fault.

  


I pay $500 a month, my own mobile bill, my own food, and I do their dishes, vacuum their house, take full care of their dogs, take out their garbage, get their mail, etc.

  


He honestly just let me down as a father figure, and I just can't respect him as such since. Which my mother knows and didn't comment on or against or anything. I don't know how he thinks I perceive or respect him these days, and I don't really know how he'd react. But as of right now, I just don't see the point of celebrating him as a father when he's failed to be one from my end."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw5owc	2019-06-03 02:47:47		AITA for reorganizing my mom’s kitchen?	"TD;LR at the bottom.


So I went to visit my mom and when I got there I noticed that her kitchen was pretty messy. So I thought I’d reorganize it, like a good son. I reorganized her fridge, pantry, counters, and cabinets. I kept things in their general place so she wouldn’t have trouble finding things. 

Ex: I kept the spices in the tiny cabinet, the pots and pans in the big cabinet, and the cups, plates, and bowls in the cabinet above the microwave etc. etc. 

I never changed where things were located, I just reorganized them.

She comes downstairs to see what the ruckus is, and she starts yelling at me for “ruining her kitchen” she then proceeded to frantically look through the cabinets and she said word for word “YOU FUCKING INCONSIDERATE ASSHOLE! GO UPSTAIRS. NOW.” (Which is something an angry mom would say to their child, but I’m 23, so it was kinda weird.)

TL;DR: I organized my mom kitchen, she then called me a “inconsiderate asshole” and yelled at me to go upstairs.

bw5lbh	2019-06-03 02:36:59	TehKawaiiHamster	AITA For telling my friend about my sibling 6months into frendship?	"Alt in case the friend I'm talking about spots this post, although he doesn't read reddit, but listens to videos, he'll likely know it's me anyway First post, I'm a little shaky from crying, I'm a crybaby sometimes, so apologies for any mistakes, or anything. Must keep concise for the character limit.  


Me and my friend have always been in conflict with each other. We argue every other day, but we've also had somefun times together. Things have been getting more rocky, but I'm trying to keep friends since he's one of the only two people I talk to.  


He's the only person that I have trouble with, as I do my best to get along with everyone and it's worked until we've met. He's the first person I've had a argument with in 4yrs, he's easily pissed, I'm always at least a little stressed and he likely is too. Admittedly, we both are the issue for the problems in out friendship, we both piss each other off, I think the blame is 50/50.  


I've recently moved across the state to my half-brother, due to family issues. It's nice here, and they're very hospitable. Only three people outside family knew about them, which were elementary friends.  


Bit of backstory; first month into friendship with him, I did make a lie, that I was a single child, since I was raised like one and never had any contact with my brother other then a lunch a Denny's. I didn't think it was going to matter, and that if I did tell him, I likely wouldn't have mentioned my brother ever again afterwards and nothing will change.  


I'd just come home, from hanging out with my brother and his family a one of their friends home, it was a good time. Brother did something funny, and I wanted to tell my friend about it. Thought it'd make him laugh as he's been gloomy lately. I texted him he was fine at first and said to just tell the story he'll come back to read it after dinner. I mention my brother in the story casually, didn't think it'd matter.  


Right afterwards he messages me, that he's shocked about my brother and why i would say it like he knew about my brother. I didn't think nothing too bad was happening, still in a good mood. He said I lied, being single children was the only thing we had in common. I denied, as we have more then that in common, love gaming, similar sense of humor, etc,  


He continues, I finally say that I'll just stop talking, since he's upset at the moment. I've already admitted the lie early into the conversation, and I said I thought the thing was insignificant, and that I also didn't know him that well and at the time we hadn't know each other for a full month when the lie was told. He said I should've mentioned it when we did start to know about each other. Eventually it went to him telling to just continue the story, and that he isn't going to read it.  


I was always thinking on making a post here for a while now about other issues, and I've finally gotten myself a bit together enough to do it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bw5hym	2019-06-03 02:26:54	Kingaling600	AITA for telling my girlfriend that her actions are the result of mental illness, not empathy	"My girlfriend claims to be an empathetic person but I genuinely believe she is mentally ill and should discuss this with her therapist. Here me out:

She cries whenever other people are crying. It doesn’t matter why, if she sees someone crying, she starts tearing up. She won’t watch sports because she tears up if the other team loses too badly. She won’t watch movies that aren’t comedies or children’s movies.

She also laughs when other people laugh. Not out of social obligation like a polite chuckle but like a full on laugh and sometimes she can’t stop even when it wasn’t that funny and others have stopped. She says she does it even when she didn’t think it was funny but she just did because other people were and she can’t help it.

These behaviors drive me nuts and I think she should tell her therapist about these compulsions but she refuses. She says I’m an asshole for trying to change her but I’m trying to help her. Am I an asshole for telling her this is a mental illness and not just “empathy”?"	Asshole	0	0
bw5hy8	2019-06-03 02:26:53		AITA that I didn’t want my wife sticking stuff down her shirt?	"My(24) wife’s 21st birthday is today, and her parents took us and some other family out to dinner at a pretty decent restaurant. Everything was great about dinner. A guy about 20 years old who was what I would call a pretty attractive dude came up to our table to do a magic trick. Now at the table are me, my wife’s parents, her cousin and sister, and her. All the women besides her were wearing very conservative tops but my wife was wearing a tshirt that was a little revealing. I’m all for that; she’s her own woman and can wear what she wants. I’m not insecure in our marriage at all. However, the magician says for his first trick he wants her to be the participant (surprise). He hands her a folded up card and says “put it where I can’t see it” and then motions for her to stick it down her shirt. I’m not a jealous person typically, but an attractive dude asking my wife to stick stuff down her shirt didn’t sit great with me. I said “don’t stick it down your shirt” and everyone laughed because hey, I’m her husband and it’s kinda funny for me to say that because I’m not usually a jealous person. However, her mom says “stick it in your bra!” So my wife takes the card and shoves it down into her bra. Later on, he asks for the card back to finish the trick and she of course fishes it out for him. 
He continues to do tricks with all of the other women at the table and then leaves. 

I told my wife after in the car I was kind of upset about the situation and that everyone laughing at me and then telling her to do it anyways made me feel stupid and then like an asshole because maybe I shouldn’t have said anything in the first place. I didn’t yell at her or anything, I just kind of sat in silence on the way home and I apologized because me being upset made her upset and she cried.  AITA for being upset about the situation?

ive posted about my roommate here before. more or less, hes kind of a huge asshole. we got in kind of a big fight and i havent been back to the house since. one day i decided to ask a friend to come with me (just the thought of going alone sent me into an anxiety attack) to come pack my stuff up because my lease is up in a month. she's been with me the whole way through the roommate issues and was super excited  to help me! i decided to start with all the shit of mine that was either community use or that he had taken. 

all the plates were mine. the microwave was mine. pillows on the couches. he had stored stuff in baskets i bought for the cat he gave away, so i  dumped it out and packed the baskets. the only dishes of mine i didnt take were ones that he used and left unwashed in the sink, and only because i forgot to do them before leaving.
he wasnt home so i went in his room and took all my books off his bookshelf (all collectors edition things, really important to me and im pissed that he had them), my vinyls, and i even found stuff that he had stolen without telling me under his bed while looking for my controllers. the biggest thing for me was taking my mirror off his wall. he hung it without my permission and every time i explicitly asked for it back he would joke like he didnt know what i was talking about,  which would be funny if the joke ended with me getting my shit back. but it never did.

all of those things are in storage now. but there's stuff i didnt take, like my TV, clothes, big furniture, and some other trinkets.

the friend with me was stoked to see me finally taking control of shit and id be lying if i said it didnt  feel great. but my mom said i was being petty just for the sake of it. my dad agreed and said he was worried about my tv still being there in case he decides to act up, and his dad is a cop so idk what i could do about it if he does. my other friend said im an asshole and my shits prolly all smashed.

he never said anything to me about it, and it was maybe 5 days ago. havent been back since. i know going in his room was an invasion of privacy but so is him taking my shit.

as soon as i got to my parents where im crashing till the lease is up the adrenaline wore off and i felt fucking terrible for how I handled everything. again i know im entitled to my own stuff but stealing it like that felt wrong and im kind of terrified that he did take it out on my other things that i left behind. i hadn't even thought of that until other people said it.

im super fucking conflicted over all this. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw5c6y	2019-06-03 02:09:54	poptropica_veteran	WIBTA if I gave away my brothers video game	"Im on reddit mobile, so sorry if the formatting is funky or anything like that. 

This morning me (f15) and my brother (m19) got into a bad fight because I was on the couch and didn't want to move, and he wanted to play video games. 

He got pretty physically violent. He usually does over fights like that, he's also beat me over small stuff like the way I eat my pancakes, or just other petty stuff that rubs him the wrong way. 

Anyways, he ended up deleting one of my video game saves that I've been working up on for a while now. This isn't even the first time he's deleted my save for that game specifically (I don't think I'm ever going to finish the storyline for that specific game at this rate haha) I'm not really that mad about it, I think. It's not the first time it's happened so I wasn't too attached to the game, and it's his ps4 anyways, and it was taking up space. 

He also uses my laptop (he has two other ones, both pretty slow but they still work) because it's faster and I've already taken it back, but I'm sure he's not going to care too much.

Besides that, the game in question was a birthday gift from me and my bf. Speaking of which, he also doesn't like my boyfriend because hes Hispanic and just acts like he's a lower class pretty openly because of that. 

I'm thinking maybe taking his game and giving it back to my bf would be a good way for him to learn what it's like to work on something and have it taken from you. My parents will scold him at worse, so this will be pretty much the only punishment he'll get. 

I don't know what to do, because it was his birthday gift. What would make it slightly easier for me to make the choice is that on my birthday I asked to see a friend of mine in the hospital we were both in. He held the fact that he was willing to do it over my head, and told me that just because I was born it didn't mean I was entitled to anything, sayings shit like ""congratulations you were born"" I didn't ask for anything because on the day before my birthday I was in a psychiatric ward for 24 hour observation, so to be honest I had the best birthday just going to school and not being in that place anymore. 

My bf has also said he's never played the game himself, and it was all from his money. He just told me to call it a gift from both of us because he knew I was kind of upset I couldn't buy the game myself (not old enough) so he not only got the money to buy a remastered new version of the game (I was gonna buy a used copy with the 20 dollars I have) but also went out of his way to find a cousin that was willing to buy the game with his money for him. 

My brother has since apologized, to get us on good terms again, however hes apologized for things like this in the past and I know he's never going to change. 

I don't know if i wbta, but would it be morally just for me to give my brothers game back to my boyfriend?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

We booked an airbnb back in January for a group of 10 (5 couples) which everyone agreed on. In February, one of the couples found out they are expecting a child and they chose they no longer wanted to go on the group vacation due to the fact that we are going to Mexico and it was their decision to not travel out of the country while pregnant. When the rest of the group found out about the cancellation, we decided to change airbnb locations from the same renter to another property that was smaller but nicer, since we only were to have 8 guests instead of 10. We spoke to the property owner and she was fine with us switching with the stipulation that if the original booking did not get rented by someone else, we would be expected to pay the same higher price of the larger unit. This was nearly 4 months ago so we informed the husband of the expecting couple and firmly believed the other unit would get booked by someone else.

Alright enough with the small back story, come prom night the two friends come over, along with another friend which he didn’t even give me a heads up about. So the next morning I basically kick him out my house because it was 10 am and I had plans, he didn’t leave until 11 because he was sitting outside alone smoking for an hour NONE-STOP like a tweaker. He looked like he was on fucking heroin after that session. After that hour, he comes in my home without the bong and tells me he’s keeping it here, along with a jar of weed so he can hide it from his parents. I told him it wasn’t okay with neither my mother or I, and he needed to take it him. He ignored me and left anyways. I texted him for THREE days after asking him to pick it up, which he said each time “I will tomorrow”. On the third day I went outside to find my mom with the bong shattered. This wasn’t on purpose either, the bong had been knocked over when my mom went to hang clothes up. We both informed him about this group text. He ignored our group chat and directly texted me. When I told him about the bong, he demanded I pay him $60 for it, which was apparently “half” and he’d pay back the other half. 

Upon further investigation, I found the bong was worth $60. I was willing to pay him back, until I found out he was trying to get me to fully pay for it. After I got to thinking about it to, I begged him not to keep it here. He KNEW my mother was upset about it being here. MIND YOU, my friend is a spoiled child who gets money handed to him whereas I have to work my ASS off to get minimum wage along with crying after every shift over how shitty my job it. As for the weed he hasn’t come by to collect it so I think I’m just going to smoke it if he doesn’t by July.

Cool guy, loves to talk (and can talk your head off for 2-4 hours easily) loves going out, etc... I'm guessing A gets it from his mother, since his dad is unpleasant as hell. Meaning, he's greedy, angry, and hypocritical. He's lazy. He has always talked down to his kids, threatened to kick them out, etc... (all of them have moved out since). Child Protective Services has visited that house because of him... He's talked down to A in easily 90% of their conversations... 

&#x200B;

Anyway, on to what created this post... today, we were out walking and he's talking about how he's moved out with his girlfriend, he's holding a job, their kid is almost a year old, etc... We go out to eat. We go back to A's parents' house (short visit for him), and we sat on the front porch, just shooting the shit. Well, his dad walks out to get something from his vehicle, and makes some sort of remark. A then asks him ""What was that?"" His dad replies with, ""sittin on your ass, what's new?"" Thennnn they have some back-and-forth bullshit...again...for the 50 millionth time, of course. Then his dad says, ""you know what? I'm glad you moved out. Last I checked, your fat ass ain't no good!""

&#x200B;

Then I spoke up.

&#x200B;

I calmly said, ""Sir, last I checked, your the reason why your kids visit you only once a year. Also, try not to get divorced again, and try happiness for once."" He stared me down for maybe a good 10 seconds... got his things from his truck, closed the truck door, and just stared into space for a minute. He walked back inside (without a word), head hanging down, and a few tears rolling down his face.

I don't live with my parents, but every time I spend a weekend at home, my dad will ask me to help him for certain household tasks such as gardening, moving boxes, etc...I am always happy to contribute to the household and give back to the man who raised me. However, his attitude about it is always extremely frustrating. The second he thinks of something, he basically expects you to drop everything to help him immediately even though the task is not an emergency. He basically refuses to plan for when it is convenient for everyone involved and expects you to help him at his beck and call.

Often, the second I walk in the door and before I take my shoes off, he will ask me to take out recyclable items to our recycling cart for collection. The recycling cart is only like a 30 second round trip walk down the driveway, but this usually frustrates me because we have a recycling bin inside the house that basically stays perpetually empty. Don't normal people throw their waste in their indoor recycling bin, let it build up, and take it out to the recycling cart when it's full?

Anyways, now to the current situation: He has been sick this weekend with the flu, so he has been short with me all weekend. I have helped him with household tasks and been respectful. I came home after going out to eat lunch, and as I am taking off my shoes, he tells me to take old magazines out to the recycling cart outside. At this point I get annoyed and tell him that I will take them out later WHEN I AM ON MY WAY OUT and will pass by the recycling cart anyway. He gets angry and orders me to take them out immediately. I tell him no because while it is a small inconvenience, it inconveniences me to have to backtrack for no reason. I tell him that I can take them to my room until I leave the house a few hours later and dispose of them then. Am I crazy or should this make no difference to him whatsoever??? I am willing to do it, I just don't want to inconvenience myself to do it IMMEDIATELY when it makes 0 difference WHEN I do it. As I said, we literally have a recycling bin inside that stays perpetually empty. It's there for a reason, why not use it? I'm willing to meet him halfway and take the magazines out on my way out, but apparently it's not good enough for him. Anyways, he gets furious and calls me a piece of shit and we have one of the biggest arguments ever over the stupidest thing. I end up storming out of the house and haven't talked to him since.

So reddit...AITA? Or is he TA?

Here’s some context: Sister(30) asks me (24) to drive her to the train station. Today is my last day with my gf before she heads back to her place 3hrs from my home so I really wanted to just relax with her. (we’re doing long distance relationship). I agree and take my sister at 1:45pm the time she said she was ready to leave. (she doesn’t mention the plays at 3:00pm, I find out later thru text) Today was also the gay pride parade which I didn’t realize so there was traffic. She eventually asks if I can just take her to manhattan, to which I reply No, I want to spend time with my gf on our last day before we see each other again for some time. I did however offer to pay for her Uber. I try parking on a corner to which she then yells and talks down to me to park in front of this one apartment instead so that she gets an exact address from her friend. 

Finally we reach the area she wants me to drop her off at where I’m already fuming and she says I should’ve taken her thru the highway and some other stuff (I can’t remember because I was furious at this point with what she said) and that was when I freaked out and told her to gtfo the car. We begin arguing in the car wasting time and causing traffic to which she finally leaves the car. The link has images of our phone convo to better understand what went down and I’d love to know who everyone thinks is the asshole from an unbiased group.

I don’t go on reddit much so I’m sorry about the poor format."		1	0

bw55qd	2019-06-03 01:51:13	bloatish	AITA For telling my very christian mom that I don’t believe in God, knowing it would hurt her feelings?	"I’m (F) 15, and when I was younger, I had never really felt attached to a god. I have always had a nerd brain, and I only believed in causation, and everything needing to have proof. I didn’t really believe in his existence, or the existence of any spiritual figures, but I still got dragged to church every single weekend against my will.

When I was around 12, I told my mom I didn’t want to go to mass anymore. To be honest, it was because I found it boring. My mom had a complete meltdown and she was literally praying to god that I’d find the right path for the next year, and she would cry about it in church. I never mentioned it again knowing how upset it made her, until today.

This morning, my mom and I went to church, as usual.  I zoned out during the entire thing, as usual. I went about my day as normal, until supper time. My mom called us down and we ate together as a family. After a bit, it was only me and my mom, and she brought up mass this morning. She asked me what I had retained from the homily, and I didn’t want to lie, so I said I had zoned out. She understood, and she laughed about how I had the attention span of a flea. But then, I had the urge to tell her it wasn’t only because of that I didn’t listen, so I did.

I went on about how religion was forced upon me, and she never gave me the option, or even asked if I believed. She understood that I am young, and I am still figuring things out, but even so, I don’t think she understood that I don’t believe whatsoever. She kept saying things like, “later in life, you’ll just have to take a leap of faith.” Have to? I don’t think so.

We ended the conversation on good terms, and I tried brightening the mood with a joke. Then I left. I am now on the sofa, listening to her sob in the kitchen. Should I have told her or just kept it to myself?

TLDR: Told my mom that I didn’t believe in God knowing it would hurt her feelings. Now listening to her cry."	No A-holes here	0	0

bw54ey	2019-06-03 01:47:20	WeddingAssholeTA	AITA for not supporting my recently out trans friend at my wedding?	"I've wondered about this for a while. Looking back, I am not sure if I would have done anything differently--or what I could have done differently.

My friend Ashley came out as trans (MTF) a few months before the day I married my husband. Since she is the friend that introduced us, she had been asked to be in the wedding party, but as a groomsman, because we thought she was a guy at that point, and she had known my husband since high school. Over the next couple months, she originally said she just wanted to be out, then later she said she might transition, and basically we smiled and nodded and tried our best to support her. (This was about a decade ago, we were all in our early 30s, and it was the beginning of trans awareness trends in my area, so there was a lot of much needed learning and googling involved.)

A couple months before our wedding, she pulled me aside and asked if she could be on the bridesmaids' side and wear the same dress.

The dresses had been ordered a couple months before that, and there definitely wasn't enough time to order one for her. After thinking about it, my husband and I told her that obviously it was really important to us to have her there on our wedding day--without her there would be no wedding. We explained the dress situation and offered her to either stay in the bridal party in a suit on my husband's side, or to excuse herself from the bridal party and come in any outfit that would make her feel comfortable. After about a week, she told us she wanted to stay in the wedding party in a suit. We offered that she could change into whatever she wanted after the ceremony and pictures, but she very quickly turned that down.

When I look at my wedding pictures, they're beautiful, and everyone looks truly happy. But I often wonder if we should have made a different choice.

Some side thoughts that may or may not matter, I don't know:

The dresses were a lilac pink/purple off-the shoulder, form-fitting bandage dress (remember those?) that would have been hard to match even remotely, and Ashley was not yet at a point where her body was shaped the same way that many dresses are cut to flatter.

Also, my family loved Ashley when they first met her (when she still presented as a man) and thought that she and I would end up together, so although it wasn't a concern back then, looking back I often wonder about how much explaining I would have had to do. Again, trans awareness was on the way up in our area. (My father and brother-in-law had a lot of questions for the first year, and many were highly inappropriate.)

Lastly, she hadn't come out at work yet, so she wasn't dressing in typical female clothes all the time; it was about 50/50 I think at that point.

Anyway, this had been on my chest for ten years, so please be honest: AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bw53qa	2019-06-03 01:45:18		AITA for being frustrated with my wife for not doing my laundry?	"General info: married a while, early 30s we both work and have a toddler. I have always paid all our household bills 100% (and a few of her personal bills because I can afford it and wanted to take as much off her plate as I can) and do a few things around the house. Wife does most big cleaning and she cooks sometimes. Maybe 2 months ago she asked if I could bring my laundry down every Saturday, sure no prob I always try to carry laundry to/fro anyway. 2 weeks ago she asked me to bring it down, I said it’s barely halfway filled and she dropped it. Last week we were away. This week clothes are piled up and she says she won’t do them because it’s too much. 

I ask why she feels this way and she says “you shoulda bought em down when I asked a few weeks ago”. I said “if it was this serious, maybe you should have spoken further on it, even if you said ‘bring it down or it won’t get done’ or something” she disagrees and we’re at a standstill. 
I left it there because I was getting frustrated and didn’t want to yell or anything. However I feel she’s being a bit unreasonable. Is it not normal to say “hey, can you do this? If not, this is what will happen”. Now I’ll have to pay to get the clothes washed. I can’t say “hey, ur phone bill was too high this month, I’m not paying it” because 1) I wouldn’t do that and 2) it comes off like I’m trying to throw it in her face which I’m not. I’m never able to talk about household things because a big chunk of my contribution is financial and anything financial being brought up seems weird.

I don’t think she should do laundry cuz she’s a woman or anything like that it’s just what we agreed to as far as household contributions."		1	0

I recently told my husband that I didn’t want to come to all his games anymore because I realized I could pursue my hobbies more with that time because I have recently been struggling to find time to do the things I like.

bw52uy	2019-06-03 01:42:48	unclesshitymanager	AITA for expecting my uncle's company to honor the discount promised in our purchase contract (even though I lost my paper copy of the contract)?	"Way too much for 3000 letters so I'll hit the high points. I worked for my uncle for many years, last year I started my own company that is exactly the type of business my uncle's company caters too (sorry I can't be specific...for this think that I run an AC business and my uncle sells sheet metal to make duct work--it's not that but similar idea). 

I was really struggling early in the year so my uncle promised me a 75% discount on all product purchased from him for 1 years time but I had to buy all products from him. It's a phenomenal deal and we both agreed to put it in writing since its a long period of time and overall a big sum of money. I have the email copy but somehow I lost the copy with his signature on it, big mistake on my part. 

My uncle married a ridiculously hot 31 year old trophy wife and is currently doing one of those Viking cruises through Europe and wanted to be free of the business for the 6 weeks he's gone and didn't even take his phone with him. He is for all intents and purposes, off the grid. 

Well his manager (also happens to be the reason I quit working for my uncle...she is an incredible ball buster and piece of shit) is refusing to honor the purchase agreement I made with my uncle. I've shown her the emails we exchanged, I've shown her the pdf of the finalized copy but she refuses to accept it without my uncles written signature. 

I am dying on the vine here because I needed this material for my next few jobs. I am probably going to have to put materials on my credit cards just to get through. I think she HAS to let me have the materials at the agreed upon price. 

I am sleepless here. I am so stressed I can hardly breath. Am I the asshole for thinking the purchase price should be honored even though I can't prove my uncle signed the contract?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I   met a girl from the website Meetup. We talked through the site for   weeks and started to text. I liked her and we had alot in common, so   started to date.

Then is got weird. She   started to want to make out along the road in a car. Which is fine. Then   we would go on dates that lasted for 6-7 hours then we would call each   other after then she would text and then email when I got home. After   5-10 emails I would nod off and when I woke up there would be many   emails continuing the conversation. after a few she would ask why I   wasn't responding, the ending with emails like ""Guess You don;t want to   talk anymore"".

The next day I would   explain I feel asleep and she would still be mad. Once We talked about   biking and she stated she didn't like to cause she was ""out of shape""  (   she was a bigger girl but not fat). I told her we could go for a slow   ride and she came back with "" Why cause I'm Fat?"" After that she told   everyone I called her fat which I didn't.

Going   out we had great time but as soon as we parted she would complain  about  school, her job, people at work, her professors, classmates  cheating,  failing her classes. Anything I would say to try and help was  met with  :you don't fucking understand..."" I tried to support her.  Once she asked  me to come over and sleep at her house, this was after  we has sex once  about a month before. and I stated I word til midnight  and she lived a  hour from my job. I started if I did I would come over  and just shower  the sleep. She said ok and after I got in bed she  said:What no sex??""

So,  after all that I  had a talk telling her I didn't like being complained  to for hours,  next call she did it again for 3 hours, then again the  next time. So I  ghosted her. After  a week she texted a horrible text, I  ignored it,  week later a worst text, again ignored it. Week later she  texted my  friends wife to complain. His wife stated if they wanted to be  friends  she could trash talk me. Which she did numerous times. She  blocked her  then ex started trying to friend my friends daughter to talk  trash  about me. Blocked. Then I got more texts. Finally I got the last  email  from her stating I was an asshole cause I ghosted her in her time  of  need?????

bw52fh	2019-06-03 01:41:39	Babiesdontsolveit72	AITA for agreeing to have a baby only if my husband agrees to provide most or all of the childcare?	"So I’m fully aware this may be beyond this sub’s paygrade but right now I’m in this phase where I just want as many opinions as possible.

Anyways, we’ve been together 7 years, married for 3. We were both childfree when we met but slowly he’s shifted over to wanting kids. Our marriage over the past year has been extremely rocky as a result since we still love each other and don’t want to live without each other.

But our marriage counselor in recent months has been pushing us to find a resolution because things can’t go on without getting worse. My husband sat me down a few weeks ago to talk about trial separation. He feels that if he misses his chance for children he’ll only resent me years later and he’d rather separate now than cause more pain for us. I’m heartbroken to say the least. 

Recently I saw a friend and she suggested something I’m afraid to bring up to my therapist or our counselor because I think they’ll call it crazy. She says I should just tell my husband I’d be willing to have a baby if he promises to take over all of the childcare, from infancy to teenager. This way we can stay together, he gets his child, and I still get to live my life as I’ve always dreamed. 

I havent asked him yet but I’ve talked to my mom and sister. They said it’s feasible but they can’t imagine this system working out in the long run, and that I’ll probably get more people judging me for being an “absentee mom.” AITA for considering this option instead of separation?"	Asshole	0	0

He was very supportive when I had love problems and things like that. We graduated High School and, while we weren't as close as before we still hanged out with our other friends from Highschool. Recently some of us went to a bar, he wasn't there yet, I was talking with 2 friends and somehow we started to talk about him, one of them mentioned like 

\-yeah I encountered him with a guy the other day, I think they are dating

I tought I hadn't heard right so I asked 

\-dating? with a guy?

\-Yeah, because, you know, he...-And then she stopped because she realized I didn't knew what they were talking about

\-Don't you know?-Said the other one

\-Know?

They looked at each other in confussión and finally the second girl said

\-He is gay

\-We tought you already knew, since you 2 are very good friends

\- No, I had no idea

We change the subject and he arrived a bit later, I was a little distant that reunión but I don't know if he noticed that. I felt strange that day, I had trusted him a lot of things and he hadn't trust me for that even tough he knew I support him completely, I gathered more information and it resulted that, except for the friends that don't hang with him anymore and one girl that lives in other state, I was the only one he hadn't told that personally, heck, he even told 2 girls he was barely friends with in highschool. Later in another reunión I mentioned casually that he was gay, but he didn't put a lot of importance on that, like ""Oh yeah I hadn't told you yet, but good to know you already know that"".

I acept him and I dont have any problems with him being gay but it makes me feel angry that I trusted a lot of things that were very improtant for me but he didn't have that kind of trust with me.

For roughly six years, my sister was incredibly abusive towards me. It started when I was 10. I won't go into details, but there is a post on my profile detailing more stuff, explaining the situation more in case you would like more context. I was in therapy for three years. My parents suffered hugely during this six year period as well. The final straw that led to my sister getting kicked out was her getting my father arrested on a bogus assault charge and kept away from the family home (in which she was barely living) for 3 months. My sister refuses to see, speak or hear from my father. My mother is still in contact with her, but often comes home incredibly upset after seeing her, suggesting she still hasn't changed. I haven't seen my sister in 2 and a half years, and I plan on keeping it that way. My parents have never really ""understood"" what I went through. Remarks like ""I hope you two can be friends one day"", as if I wasn't beaten, manipulated and belittled for 6 years, and that person is still prioritised over me in certain aspects.

My father recently asked me what I plan to do about certain family events, such as our final grandfather's funeral (he hasn't died yet, but he's old, and in and out of hospital). I hadn't even thought this far ahead, and being faced with these events has caused difficulty. If my sister does attend, I won't go. But there are other events where no contact isn't feesable. The one that springs to mind is if my parents die, be it in 40 years, or a freak accident tomorrow. I don't want to EVER see my sister again. The will, I know, is split 50/50, in terms of the two properties my parents own and all assets. I respect my parents' choice about that. It's their stuff, it's their choice, however, I don't want to meet with my sister to sort out the sale of assets, etc. WIBTA if I asked them to put something in their will, that would sort this situation out ahead of time, essentially giving me first ""dibs"" on the stuff in the houses and legally the person in charge of sorting out assets whilst the split remaining 50/50. I fully intend on honouring my parents' wishes. I'm a reasonable person, and I couldn't live with myself if I stabbed, particularly my father, in the back after his death after his daughter had betrayed him whilst he was living."	Asshole	0	0

He had a bad habit of cursing a lot but I'm guilty of that too lol, that was our gig. When I started Uni I noticed the first cracks of it, he had a job and we were chatting less, I don't mind that but the fact that every time we were on a talk he started insulting me on my preferences and hobbies and boasting around like only he has any idea what it's right and what people should do and not, jokingly at first but he picked up paste to that point where he came up with insulting my dad and berating me on what religious and political views I had. I issued to him that he can't speak like that to me no matter how long he knows me some things just don't go beyond a point. Befriending him really left some scars that left me introverted and having speech issues that I can't open up to others positively which myself and others noted.

I know with my sister caught her husband having a affair and basically figuring out all the lies he’s been doing. She’s been working out with him and it seems there doing better. My brother and his wife have a lot problems too but not sure the extent of it. I know his wife gets drunk and begins to bash there marriage. Telling everybody she wants to divorce him and she’s only there for the kids. They hide a lot of things which I understand but also try to hard to portray there a happy family on social media. Anyways every time My family and I visit it seems there rude and basically mean to us including the kids. They ignore us to the point we just want to leave. They’ll make plans as a family but won’t include us and just straight out ignore us. My brothers wife is so rude to us she won’t even greet us when where visiting. Even her kids ignore my kids. My kids keep trying to start conversation with them buy they rudely ignore them and walk away. My brother will talk to us and acknowledge us but it’s obvious his wife gets irritated when he does. My sister basically does the same thing. On social media she always posts her kids and we always acknowledge the pictures and write a comment or “like” her pictures but when we post are kids she ignores the post but will acknowledge someone else’s pictures. It sounds petty but she makes it obvious she doesn’t care for our kids. It’s been like this for a few years now. My wife hates to spend time them because it’s basically a miserable time with them. My mom sees it too but will never say anything for she never wants to have any confrontation. She even will end up ignoring us too to please my sister it seems. She relies on her for everything so she’ll do what she wants. So I decided to stop coming around including holidays. But I know there going to end up tell everybody else that we decided not to be part of the family which is kinda of true but for the reason they don’t want us around seems. I’m not why but the only thing I could think of is there not happy so they get irritated when they see us.AMTA for not coming around on holidays and basically not being part of my Immediate family anymore??		1	0

&#x200B;

I ordered sushi using a food delivery app. After waiting 2 hours (it was supposed to come in 45 minutes) my food finally arrived. I am a single person and they handed me 2 bags and a drink, which I was a little confused about, but I assumed they had thrown in a free drink because of the delay. At the worst, I thought they messed up my order, but I was so hungry I didn't care to complain and took the food and went to my apartment.

&#x200B;

Upon arriving at my apartment I realized that along with my food I also had received someone else's order (fried sushi and a sprite). I looked on the receipt and realized that the other person had been waiting 30 minutes longer than I had been for my food, and I immediately felt bad. The phone number of the woman who should have received the food was on the receipt, but it was in a very weird format and I had no idea what number to call, so after some hesitation, I decided not to.

My decision to say nothing also came from the fact that I was a delivery driver and have completed 100+ deliveries. I know that the only way to learn is to learn from your mistakes (as I did PLENTY, though I was never clueless enough to give someone the wrong person's order). For that reason, I feel bad for the woman who had to wait, but not for the restaurant who delayed terribly or for the deliveryman who messed up a very straightforward job. I received 4 different calls from 2 different numbers, and didn't answer any of them. Keep in mind, this is all in Spanish (not my native language) because I am studying abroad in Argentina, and I was not about to be forced to pay for what is ultimately the restaurant's mistake.

Am I the asshole for eating the stolen food, for not answering the phonecalls, or for even considering that it is not my fault?"	Asshole	1	0

"Dude okay so I did a lot of blow one summer and decided “Hey I really like this shit, why not have it on my leg.”  So I got the chemical compound for coccain on my thigh like a year ago. Then my boyfriend has made the decision that he now wants to get a chemical compound of thc exactly where I have it, and I get it, it’s the easiest place to hide something as wild as drug tattoos for the rest of your like on your body, but  call me fucking crazy, I just think that he’s just turned a very special piece on my body that has nothing to do with him, and has now turned it into a couples tattoo. It feels as if I’m being stripped of a strong character archetype that I’ve added to myself organically. It feels like he’s being fucking lazy and just can’t think of something original to do with his idea so he’s just doing mine bc it looks cool.


****EDIT****
Okay so what brought this on is that we had a mutual friend who wanted the tattoo as well (just the thc symbol in a different area of his body), and I WENT WITH HIM to go get it. I don’t mind the tattoo idea, it’s the fact that it’s in the exact same place and size that I don’t like. I even said during the argument that he should shake it up a little bit, just make it something special to you, I just don’t want a carbon copy of what I got.
ALSOOOOO I fucking miss spoke lmao. Theres a lot of shit surrounding that tattoo, it’s not just a tribute to how much I love coke. It’s my coming of age story. A lot of shit happened in that time period of life. I got that tattoo with my ex. I met a lot of people on different walks of life surrounding this drug we all wanted to do."	Asshole	0	0

bw4vfv	2019-06-03 01:21:31	question03801	AITA for wanting to swim laps in my neighborhood pool?	"I just moved into an HOA. I pay a monthly fee which covers maintenance of common areas and amenities, including a pool.

The pool has a number of rules and guidelines, one of which is that any resident can request a lap swim at the top of the hour for 20 minutes. For example, at 2:40 p.m., I could tell the lifeguard I would like to swim laps and they would clear the pool for 20 minutes. The pool is small so even if two children were playing in the pool with one person swimming laps, the children would get in the way of the lap swimmers.

Yesterday, I requested a lap swim and everyone had the clear the pool while I swam. A woman came up to me after I had finished swimming, and told me that it was rude to have everyone get out so that one person can swim laps. I told her it was in the rules I received and she said no one ever requests a lap swim because it inconveniences everyone else. She told me to go swim at a gym if I really want to swim laps. I told her that I pay a fee to swim here, just like she does, and I don’t want to pay to use a gym as well.

AITA for wanting to swim laps in my neighborhood pool?

EDIT: It's actually common for many pools to have ""adult swims"" where children must clear the pool for 10 minutes every hour to take a break. In our pool, we allow children to swim laps with the adults if they wish. I can only swim at certain times: 12:40, 1:40, etc. until 8 p.m. on the weekend. (Pool hours are noon to 8 p.m., Monday through Sunday.) Other swimmers may swim at any other time unless an adult or child calls for a lap swim. We don't have mandatory clearings of the pool every hour since we have two guards. This only occurs if someone (an adult or a child) wants to lap swim."	Asshole	0	0
bw4uu5	2019-06-03 01:19:34	MsFoxtrot	AITA for causing my boyfriend to scratch his rims?	"My boyfriend had been out of town all day hanging out with family, while I hung around home and ran errands and such. When he was coming back home, I asked him to pick me up a milkshake from a fast food restaurant that I had been craving but hadn’t gotten earlier because the groceries had been in the car for too long already.

He called me when he got into town and told me the drive through line was super long so he was just going to come home so I did the “awww okay” thing where I was saying it was okay but I really still wanted it. He parked, went inside, and got my milkshake (took 5 minutes).

Apparently, leaving the parking lot he scraped the rim of his car on the curb (it’s one of those driveways with the island in the middle so you can only turn right and he says he couldn’t fit through it - note this was not the only driveway out of the parking lot) and now it’s scratched/the black paint has come off of the edge because his wheel doesn’t stick out over the rim to protect it.

He’s mad at me now and says the scratched rim is entirely my fault because it wouldn’t have happened if he hadn’t stopped to get me a milkshake. That may be true, but I maintain that he was the driver so he is responsible. I’m almost certain he’s gone through driveways like that before with no issue. He’s legitimately mad.

bw4uu4	2019-06-03 01:19:34		AITA for not letting my girlfriend crash at mine?	"Edit: to avoid confusion, by girlfriend I meant by female friend. 

So I’ve made a new friend who’s 27 and is always broke but goes out and parties and expects her friends to bail her out. I’m 2 years younger but way past the partying and spending money I don’t have phase and don’t find that behaviour cute or respectable anymore. 

Now I’m a student studying overseas and I pay my own bills, rent, food and have no financial aid or concessions as I’m not local. About a month ago she said she was feeling depressed and needed a night out. I agreed and invited her out with some of my friends. Turns out she had no money and me having a tough time saying no said that’s ok I’ll pay for her cab to mine and pay for a bus card to go into the city. She insisted we take a cab into the city and again I didn’t want to oppose and that would get us there quicker anyway so I agreed. 

This girl has also been seeing a guy for a month and is obsessed with him. She talks about him constantly and never asks me about me or how I’m doing or my life. That night she left within the hour to see him and made me buy cigarettes and I ended up spending $100 that night and was short of money for 2 weeks. I didn’t get a thank you or a sorry for taking long to pay me back. $100 isn’t a small amount for a student to begin with. I had to dip into my savings which is mainly an emergency fund. 

This Saturday I was already out and she invited me to come out much later because one of her other friends invited a guy and she quickly became the third wheel and kept spamming me to hurry up because she doesn’t want to be the third wheel. 

I have a major report due and wanted to leave early to get some rest. But her friend left and it was just the two of us and everytime I wanted to leave she kept going up to some guys to get cigarettes. I don’t smoke but had to hang around until she finished smoking because I didn’t want to leave her alone with some dodgy guys. Finally manage to leave at 3am. She had planned to sleep at her friend’s and I said ok I’ll wait until she gets a cab. Turns out she didn’t have her card, her Uber account was in negatives and she kept hinting at coming over to mine or booking her a cab. I’d had enough & told her that I didn’t have any more money and this wasn’t discussed nor planned earlier and I would wait with her until she finds a way to get home. She didn’t even ask if she can stay, she came at me with the expectation that I’d just let her crash at mine and when I refused started whining and questioning me as to why she can’t. I told her I have a single bed and I need to get a good night’s rest to study in the morning. She ended up getting a cab to her family’s. I messaged her that night asking to message me when she gets to theirs and apologised for not being able to let her stay at mine but she hasn’t talked to me since. 

So AITA? I’ve always had people take advantage of my inability to say no and then get mad at me for saying no and I want to change that but maybe I’m going about it the wrong way?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw4urh	2019-06-03 01:19:21		AITA for expecting new members of a group to not get offended so easily	"This post might sound a little bit vague because a lot of the people in this group are redditors and there's a very good chance that one of them could come across this post, so I'll try to word this the best I can, excuse me if I do a shit job at it.

So basically, I play an online game and my good friend created a clan about 2 years ago now, the entire point of the clan was to be a chill environment where people could fuck around and act edgy without having to worry about people getting offended easily, we would make all sorts of edgy comments; frequently as people would say ""anti-pc"" remarks, none of us were really bigoted, but we were in a community where we knew people got that and nobody was going to take it to heart. As time went on more people got recruited into the clan, and for a while all was fine, but somewhere down the line, some people started to just rapidly recruit new users into the clan without really vetting them much or giving them time to decide if the community was really a good fit for them to the point where the new members eventually outnumbered the OGs of the clan. The original owner left, and there was another guy who was put in place who is also chill and doesn't get offended easily, but he doesn't really do much in the way of leadership and is very non-confrontational, he pretty much just lets the other co-owners make all the decisions. 

To fast forward a bit, a few weeks ago now there was a bit of a situation, the original owner of the group had come back (not in a leadership position) and some of the old people and him were just fucking around and making edgy remarks how we always used to, and some of the new members got offended and left the group over it, we didn't really give a shit because our mentality pretty much boils down to ""This is what the clan was made for, if you don't like it leave."". Now, I'm a veteran member of this group but I'm not in any sort of leadership position, and a few of the co-owners were of the mindset that ""The clan has evolved from what it once was"", and they no longer wanted people being overtly offensive because new members were leaving over it, this led to a lot of extremely heated arguments and some ruined friendships, because while many of the senior members of the clan were of the same mindset as me and the original owner, some of the semi-new members who joined somewhere inbetween and had ranked up to leadership positions wanted to make it a safe space for all the newbies coming in who weren't really aware of what the original purpose of the clan was. I want the community to grow of course, but not with just anyone, with people who fit the mould of what the original owner envisioned. I feel like in a way the new leaders had betrayed the trust of the old owner by turning it into the exact opposite of what the group was originally supposed to be.

"I got braces last year with a dentist in the small town I used to live in, I've since moved to a bigger city, I work and study so I'm usually quite busy. I'm supposed to go for a check up every month but I can't afford to go on a weekday and always show up on weekends, generally in the evening because the bus takes 6 hours to get there and i have class until very late at night so leaving on Friday night is out of the table.

I've noticed that I'm always the only pacient she sees at that time and she always has to stay late, miss the rest of the day and sometimes, when there's a holiday or she doesn't work that day she comes only to see me. 

I feel like a total asshole having to ruin her weekends but I honestly don't have another way, I need some input on this guys AITA?

Edit: I forgot to say I am still paying for the treatment every time I go for a check up and getting a new dentist would mean I would have to pay for the check ups (They're free as long as I go to the same dentist) and the treatment, and I can barely afford it so a new dentist is ruled out because of the price."

After we landed at the airport, we got our luggage and began our 40 minute drive home. Since we were holding up traffic loading the bags, my father started driving before putting in our address into the GPS. Once on the highway, I saw my father trying to pull up the GPS on his phone. I immediately was concerned and told them that my mom, who was in the passenger seat, should be doing that. She told me she was on her phone and was gonna switch phones with my father. I started to argue how that was any help considering my dad was already doing it on his. Then both of my parents yelled at me to stop whining and complaining and that I really needed to learn when to shut the hell up.

When they finished, my father said that there were no cars around and he was driving slow so there was no danger for him to plug in the address. I knew that was bullshit but at this point, there was nothing else I could say without getting myself in trouble.

I was hesitant because I already have a good speaker but thought it would be good to get one.

My sister is notorious for missing things, not being completely aware, and sometimes I feel like the mother of the household. We live in a house. We have the upstairs and rent out the basement.

She will frequently eat my food, she's lost her keys, and all bills are under my name.

So my sister lost her mailbox key. That means I'm the only one to check the mail. After I got my package (delivered to my work) I asked her if she got hers or a notification. 

About 3 days later I check the mail and there's a slip that it's at the nearest post office. Normally I would bring mail to her attention then set it on the counter but this time I just put it in our regular spot.

Throughout the past 2 weeks I've thought about mentioning it but I also feel she needs to figure it out on her own. A few days ago I checked the mail again and it was a final notice. It needed to be picked up that day. 

I didn't say anything and both notices are still on the table. But it's probably been returned.

My ex-wife and I have been on relatively good terms and share almost all the same friends. One friend, Janice, we both knew since college and was basically an aunt to our kids. She passed away from melanoma skin cancer, her health deteriorated rapidly.

Before her death she asked me to come visit her. She confessed that my ex-wife (her best friend) had confided in her that my oldest child was not mine. She Bawled her eyes out asking for forgiveness for not telling me sooner. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t angry she kept it from me, but better late than never, and I just wanted to give her whatever comfort I could. 

Anyway, since then I’ve taken my ex-wife to court for paternity fraud. I basically just went to a lawyer, explained the situation, and asked him to do whatever he could. I’ve already had an official paternity test done and verified he’s not my biological son.

bw4o42	2019-06-03 00:59:57	BeamBrain	AITA for walking out on this board game?	"I went to a board game meetup this evening, and since there were a lot of us, we split into smaller groups. My group of five (all of us adults in our 20s at the youngest) played Settlers of Catan (one of the expansions that allows for 5-6 player play. I'll keep everyone anonymous by referring to them by the color they played.

&#x200B;

It was late in the game. Blue and Green were both pretty close to winning, and it was obvious it was going to be one or the other. Me, Yellow, and White were the other three, trailing far behind, trying to at least make third.

&#x200B;

It was White's first time playing the game. I'd only played it once before myself, and that was years ago. Suffice to say, we both made dumb mistakes. At one point, I accidentally made an illegal move. No big deal, right. Green (the most experienced) corrected me, I took my move back, and did something else instead.

&#x200B;

White made an illegal move almost identical to mine - in fact, it blocked off the move I'd wanted to make. Green explained to White why this was an illegal move... but then after a moment, Green and Yellow agreed to let White make the move anyway ""because he's new."" I mentioned that my very similar move hadn't been allowed, but I was ignored.

&#x200B;

Then my turn came up again. I would've been able to make the move I wanted legally this turn, had White's move not blocked it off. I asked, as a compromise, that White's move be replaced on the board with one that was functionally near-identical but that wouldn't hose me. Green and Yellow refused, with Green saying ""We're being understanding of him since he's new. This isn't a cutthroat game.""

&#x200B;

""Alright, then, guys. I'm out."" I walked away from the game, I considered sticking around to try to find another, but there were only about 45 minutes left in the meetup, so it was highly unlikely anyone would start a new one, and besides that, the whole thing had kind of killed my desire to play. Spending the next 45 minutes at the event doing nothing but being annoyed wouldn't do favors for me or anyone else, so I drove home.

&#x200B;

For the sake of disclosure, something that might have motivated Green and Yellow's behavior. Earlier in the game, I did target a hostile move against White, even though they were in last place. Others at the table protested, saying I should be aiming at Blue (who was comfortably in the lead at this time). I explained that I'd realized that I wasn't winning this one, but I was going to avoid getting last place if I could help it."	Asshole	0	0
bw4ne1	2019-06-03 00:57:48	LegitimateSundae	"AITA for cutting this ""close"" friend out of my life?"	"I was extremely close friends with this one girl (best friends even). We were part of a group of about 10 people. One day she got a boyfriend and he was extremely jealous of our friendship she distanced herself (since I'm a guy). She also distanced herself from other guys in the group. I tried to spend time with him so he wouldn't be jealous and we became 'pseudo-friends', we'd have a good time in person but just never talk outside of that. That's okay.

During this, one of the girls in the group got a crush \[A\] on me. I wasn't interested, I just didn't want to date anyone from the group and considered her a close friend. She spread lies to her and her other girlfriends in the group and we all became divided. To top this off, since the girls were all so close to each other, I made it clear I wanted distance from my best friend (because of her bf and this) because I just didn’t want to be around her \[A\] anymore and she was always following them around. She interpreted this as “choose her or choose me”, and it’s not what I said at all. I texted this, and in hindsight it was a mistake. The group split, they formed a group without me and in return, I formed a group with the ones in the group I trust, without them. We stopped talking for three months and for me it sucked because I didn't do anything. Our friendship was finished, and it took me a long time to move on, I had tried to contact them to arrange a coffee just to discuss this and what she had said, since we were so close, but I did, for the most part.

After three months, I was contacted by the now ex best friend and her other friend (who was close too). They had realized their lying friend was toxic and I was finally given the time of day to talk. We became friends again, but our friendship was extremely strained, I found what they did incredibly hard to forgive and demanded we spend time together regardless of how her boyfriend feels (am I wrong here?) and maybe I could even though they were extremely busy with work and leaving for different countries in three months. They had organised birthday events for two people in the group I wasn’t a part of, completely missed mine, etc. We spent virtually no time together after our ""coffee"" except in one big group events.

The final line was when I told her the groups we made had lost their purpose, and she lied and made excuses for it existing (of which I confirmed weren’t true from other friends). I told her to add me in, I’ll add her to mine and we can go back to the default group. Her answer was no. I found it extremely disrespectful and told her either add me in or we are finished as friends. She chose the latter. I told her to go \*\*\*\* herself. She told me she’s hurt by this and doesn’t know what to do even though I told her EXACTLY what I wanted her to do (it’s just a lack of respect right?). I’m going through something akin to heartbreak, again, because we were close, but I have no intention of going back. Wouldn’t you have done the same? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

He was supposed to meet me at my apartment and we were going to walk to a place to get dinner and drinks and I figured if things went well he’d come over after and we’d smoke a few bowls or something. I do live downtown so he couldn’t find parking and asked if he could pick me up and wed drive to a restaurant instead. 

I got in the car and he looked like his pics and he was friendly and stuff but as we started driving it seemed like everything he was saying was complaining about how he didn’t like our city because it was too crowded and stuff like that. 

He then asked about my job and if we were hiring. I told him no because it was family owned and we have like five employees. He asked how I got my job then and how I was qualified. I am an outdoor leader out west and I get paid to mess around outdoors so I do admit I have a cool job, but I did work very hard for it and it’s my third job leading backpacking trips and it’s my first one out west. He said he assumed I couldn’t be the main guide and I was surely just the assistant (which might’ve been sexist) He then asked if all I do as a backpacking guide is go in front of the line and tell them fun facts. I tried explaining that we have to navigate the trail, be medically certified to treat people in the wilderness when we’re not close to hospitals, how we are pretty much responsibly for these people for up to 15 days so it’s kinda hard. He then said something about how we pretty much just teach people how to turn on a cooking stove (what). 

This was all happening in about 15 minutes. I felt like I really didn’t wanna spend the rest of the night with this guy I didn’t like being around very much and asked him nicely if maybe he could drop me back off at my apartment and apologized. I blamed it on me being high, even though I wasn’t really high. He then made fun of me for being way too out of my mind high and not functioning.

I felt bad and on the way back we made small talk and it was pretty awk.  I feel bad because my friend pointed out that he was probably just nervous and people aren’t really themselves when they are nervous and I should’ve given him a longer chance to be himself I guess? I just felt like there was no connection at all and rather than wasting our time and his money (if he paid for the food and stuff) to just cut it now.

Example: my boyfriend loves to play guitar. I have never heard of RM being a guitar player and he’s never picked up his own more than once or twice and now that my boyfriend plays his, all of the sudden RM thinks he’s a musician too.

Anyways, RM just out of the blue got a cat a couple months ago because he was lonely. Never taken care of an animal a day in his life. He didn’t realize UNTIL WE MOVED IN that his litter box needs to be cleaned every other day, that the cat CONSTANTLY runs out of food and water when he isn’t home (I only realized since I’m home all day) and that his cat needs more attention than a couple pieces of kibble and a pat on the head. And it makes me mad when RM comes home and doesn’t even check the food or water. He either gets high and eats or goes to his room and sleeps. He even forgets to buy food!

Since we’ve been here we’ve been feeding him, making sure his water is full and giving him tons of love. Now he doesn’t leave our sides and doesn’t leave us alone.

One more thing is (after putting off the appointment three times) RM finally takes him to the vet to find out that he’s diabetic. The doctor gave strict instructions that the cat needs 1 shot every 12 hrs. (If given at 7am, must be given at 7pm etc,) Recently RM has been “forgetting to come home” and skipping the cat out on his insulin. This infuriates me.

Today he just so happened to barely get home at 9:30pm. He said he would give it to him now. Only problem is, he’ll need to give him insulin tomorrow at 9:30am as well. This won’t happen since he leaves the house everyday at 8am for work.

I’m not very confrontational (especially since we’re staying with him) and I know he’s not my cat but today I said a few words and made it clear that he needs to take better care of his cat and stay on his schedule.

AITA for hounding him about this stuff? My boyfriend and their mutual friend has been hounding him too. I just don’t know if I’m overreacting about it at all. I just don’t want this cat to suffer because of his owners ignorance."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw4lb9	2019-06-03 00:51:24	prettypieceofgarbage	AITA for telling my crush to not text me about his girlfriend?	"so I've been hardcore crushing on this guy for about a year now. he's super sweet and funny and I honestly thought that he had a crush on me until he told me that he had a girlfriend who is my friend. I played it chill until I kinda had a breakdown five months later. I told him I had a crush on him and he was okay about it and we stayed friends. but sometimes when we texted he would throw in things like ""I hugged my girlfriend today"" or ""I love my girlfriend so much"" and I would usually respond with ""cool, I gtg do something bye"". 

then one day he texted me ""I kissed my girlfriend on the lips today"" and that's when I lost it. I really lost it. I didn't respond and I started bawling so much to the point where I called a crisis hotline because I just felt awful about myself. after talking to the crisis counselor, I decided to text my crush to not tell me about his girlfriend because it was pretty painful for me. he said okay. but a few minutes later my friend texted me a screenshot where my crush told her that I was crying because of him and that he felt like a horrible friend. 

and because of that now I feel like I should have at least been more subtle about it. so idk, AITA?

bw4jyq	2019-06-03 00:47:34		WIBTA For ruining my coworkers relationship after he made comments about my body	I [22F] started working a summer job at the beginning of May at a chain home improvement store and my coworker [18M] is super cute. We’ve been flirting and talked about hooking up. He sent me nudes on Snapchat, I sent him some. He’s been super nice at work, we’ve been lightly verbally teasing each other back and forth. Initially he had told me he was single, but he dropped a bombshell on me that he actually had a girlfriend of one year. Now I refuse to be a home wrecker, and I don’t like being put in this position of being the side bitch. So I told him we had to cut that shit out and he agreed. I refuse to take any part in this drama, so I’m not going to tell his girlfriend, he can fuck that up on his own just fine. But lately he’s been making comments about me to another young male coworker while I’ve been in the “room” (we work outside in the garden area). He said I have small tits (I have a B cup), said that I look like I’m 15 and have the body of a boy (I’m short and have a young face) that I look like would’ve been beat up in high school for correcting other students. He went on to say I was awkward and he was surprised anyone would want to be with me. I was fine with the joking before, but this straight up feels like sexual harassment. Now he sent me nudes through Snapchat and they saved in chat. WIBTA if I saved the nudes and sent them to his girlfriend (he added me on Instagram and has her tagged in photos). Obviously I’ve deleted mine so he can’t spread them but he’s a dumbass and hasn’t deleted his. My other  option was the adult option, go to HR and report him. At the  end of it all I have to work here till August and either way I’d be making drama, which I’m not a fan of.	Not the A-hole	1	0

bw4h7n	2019-06-03 00:39:46		AITA for watching a movie without my boyfriend?	"We're both 20. 

&#x200B;

A new movie recently came out which I really wanted to see and about a month ago (before it came out) I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to see it, otherwise I would see it with M. My boyfriend said yes though, and was very keen to see it. I had a voucher we could use for the 'luxury' theatre and we were going to turn it into a nice date night. By the time we got around to booking, there was an error with the voucher and I had to contact support. I'm still waiting for them to fix the issue so we haven't been able to book yet.

Last night I went out with M to watch a different movie. We were having fun so afterwards we decided to watch another movie - the movie I was going to watch with my boyfriend. I felt a bit guilty so I didn't message him at all through the night and I only told him this morning that I watched it. He seems a bit agitated and passive aggressive now but I don't think it's that big of a deal.

bw4g6j	2019-06-03 00:36:51	genescheesesthatplz	WIBTA for bailing on a family trip to visit my in-laws because they refuse to call him by his name?	"So, my family and I live on the opposite side of the country from my in-laws. They are wonderful, fantastic people whom I love but we've come to a major breaking point in our relationship: my son's name. I wanted to give my son a specific name that my husband decided was too casual, but we could use as a nickname. So, working backwards, we came up with an excellent, formal name that we could use my name as a nickname for (which was great because my husband and I have long formal names but go by our nicknames). 

&#x200B;

The problem is MIL doesn't approve of the nickname. She has taken our son's formal name and come up with her own and refers to him by it exclusively. To the point that the entire side of the family on that coast refers to him by MIL's nickname. I found this to be deeply hurtful. While I can't control what people do I found it incredibly disrespectful that my MIL would tell her family to call him her own specific nickname (husband and I don't have social media so there is no other way for his family to know that we call him something different). I spoke with her about it and expressed my hurt and she said it was her right as her Grandma to give him a nickname. Fair enough, I thought, but I asked her out of consideration for how I feel to please ask everyone else to call him by my nickname. She didn't think it was something I should be upset about but begrudgingly agreed to tell everyone to call him my name. 

&#x200B;

This was about 9 months ago. I thought that we had moved past this, and that we had gotten over the bad feelings between us. We're supposed to fly out to see them in two days and I was genuinely excited to see everyone, including MIL! But FaceTiming two days ago I could heard family in the background referring to my son by MIL's name, immediately making me want to cry. It feels sooooooo unbelievably disrespectful that not only would she try to give my son her own name, but would also not respect my wishes. I can't stand the idea of sitting around his whole 30+ family members for the next week, trying to decide if I want to hear her nickname the whole time or if I want to be the bitchy daughter-in-law who keeps correcting everyone else. 

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I just didn't go on the trip? My husband can take our son to see his family and I don't want to deal with the drama, but I also don't want to be petty and miss out on a nice family trip. My refusing to go would be seen as a major slight by his family.

Edit: thank you all for your input and judgement. As someone said this was probably better suited for r/relationshipadvice, but I was *hoping* for judgement on my decision to stay home. Unfortunately a lot of you who thought I was going to be TA also thought it would be appropriate to call me names other than TA for caring about this. This is *one* situation in my life I wanted input on. You all have no idea what goes on in my life besides this."	Asshole	0	0

bw4fhl	2019-06-03 00:34:43	Saph_B	AITA: Fighting with dad over feeling unheard. Am I the asshole?	"I’ve recently come back to my parents home from university after struggling to finish my 4 years of undergrad. Over the past month, there’s been instances where we fight, me being the instigator because he wasn’t listening. The first instance was when I was helping him in the kitchen. We were making 2 dishes and he told me not to use one spoon in both of them. I said, “Of course” and he then said that I wasn’t listening to what he said. I repeated word for word what he said to me and he then insisted that I didn’t understand what he said. After going back and forth for a bit, I finally convinced him I’d heard him and we dropped the subject. 

A couple days later, we ran into an issue with the shower. My step mom informed my dad that her showers were running cold after being there for 20 min.  My dad dismissed her and made nothing of it since it never occurred to him.  The same issue happened to me but I never brought it up to him, thinking it was a one time thing. He asked me about my shower and I told him that the water wasn’t as hot as it usually was when I’d shower over the last couple of weeks. We chalk it up to the water heater needing time to thoroughly heat the water. A couple of minutes later, we discover that the kitchen water was able to run hot and he then insists that I don’t know how to use the shower. I then explain how I operated the shower and go on to say that him saying that I didn’t know how to use the shower insinuated that I was stupid. He got mad at that so I just walked away. 

That same day, he shows me messages he’d received from an old friend. This would raise concern for us since my family went through this thing that estranged us from all our old friends - so for him to be contacting us made me suspicious. I expressed this sentiment and said that if I was in my dad’s place, I would have questioned him as to why he was getting into contact with us out of nowhere (discretely of course). My dad didn’t like this and proceeds to lecture me on how I shouldn’t see the bad in people and to not treat old friends with suspicion. I get annoyed and say that that’s my opinion and double down on it. We argue and I storm off. Since then (it’s been 3 days), I’ve limited my talks with him to one syllable/sentence. 

Here’s where the AITA comes in. Me not talking to him is the worst thing I can do to him. I once asked him if I ever made him cry and he said it was once, when I didn’t talk to him for a whole month because he wouldn’t let me buy a new laptop (I was going to use money I had received as a scholarship from my uni). 

So, am I the asshole for not talking normally with my dad because I’m not feeling heard, knowing that it hurts him?"	Asshole	0	0

For some context, I will never leave a ranked game as it is not just fun but also competitions. I will however leave if the following happens in a normal game:

- three or more of my teammates lock in the same role ( ex jungler ). I do not leave if three assassins are locked for example, provided they go where they need to go

- our team is getting torn apart and they refuse the surrender vote. I only do this when our score is around 2-18 and the enemy team is in our base. I don’t think being repeatedly stomped is pleasant for anyone.

On those circumstances I believe my teammates are ruining both my fun and that of the enemy team, and I want the game to be over with ASAP.

"My husband and I live across the street from a grocery store and we're over there pretty much every day and often together. We recently moved to the area, but this is his hometown so he has a lot of friends and I haven't made any good friends yet except for his friends. He was out of town for 2 weeks because his mom was sick and while he was gone, I was spending a lot of time with a couple of his friends that I get along with because I was lonely. I went to the same grocery store twice with one of them, once to grab a coffee and once to buy some stuff for dinner with him and his wife. 

My husband got back from his trip and went to the grocery store without me and a cart collector pulled him aside and told him that I was a snake and that I was stepping out on him with another guy and parading him around and that all the workers were talking about it. My husband told hi to mind his business and then told me everything. I was extremely upset by the judgement and it made me feel embarrassed to go back to the store because I will be judged every time for this misconception and apparent gossip about me. I went back to the store with my husband and got a manager and told her what the guy had told my husband. The manager told me he was going to get fired and I haven't seen him since.

bw4dq2	2019-06-03 00:29:40	Jackidibs	AITA for not visiting my brother and his new born.	"Heads up I’m on mobile sorry.

Background: I’m a student currently in my last year of University. I’ve just moved back in with my parents as money has gotten really tight for me and my parents offered to let me board just for my last year of study. 

Brother relationship: my brother is my half brother who is more than 10 years older than me. He lived close by when I younger but since then we hardly ever talk besides family emergencies, birthdays, holidays. I’ve seen him twice in the past six years. He lives remotely. Love him non the less.

So January 2018 my brothers wife gave birth to a cute little baby. It’s the first baby in our family and I was delighted.
My brother wanted me to fly up to visit which I really wanted to do but I had no money for that at all. Flights to their location are around $800-$1000 AUD and Christmas just passed so I was super broke from trying to buy everyone Christmas presents. At the time I didn’t even have enough to service my car which was overdue, I was paying rent, my loan, bills, working casually and studying full time. I explained I couldn’t yet but I’ll try my hardest. He seemed pretty ticked off.

Fast forward to now, I still haven’t visited sadly. My brother is very blunt and short with me on the phone. They’re all pissed that I haven’t visited. I legit have no money. E.g. I got paid Thursday and after all my bills and groceries and fuel for the week I have $3.24 to my name (YAY). I’ve had to have heaps of specialists appointments for my health lately which has eaten up all my savings even though I’ve moved home and don’t have to pay rent this year. 

My boyfriend is living pretty well because of his job and does take us on brief holidays close by aka like an hour (my brother lives 20+ hours away) which I don’t pay for at all but I’ve explained that to my brother but he seems to think I should have been able to afford to fly up and see his baby still.

My parents offered to pay for my brother, his wife and baby to flown up when ever they like so that everyone including my younger brother, elderly nan, etc can see them all, but they’ve declined on multiple occasions.

I hate asking for my parents money so I wouldn’t ask them to send me up I just feel so guilty doing that when they already let me live with them rent free.

My brother earns a pretty good living and in the past 15 years has visited our house once. 

I’m currently tutoring on top of my job to hopefully have enough money by the end of the year to see them all. Is that too late? It will be nearly 2 years?

bw4d0c	2019-06-03 00:27:31		AITA for changing my lease without telling my roommate?	"Earlier this year I signed a lease with three of my friends in an off-campus Student apartment. At the point we signed, everything was fine and we all got along fine. We were not all best friends, but we were all clean and tolerable, so I wasn't really worried. The rooming situation was me, my friend Maria, and my friend Jane. We all hung out together a few times and while Maria was not my favorite person, I figured she would still be fine to room with.

I started to feel worried that our friendship would not work because we are just such different people. Hanging out with her was starting to feel exhausting because she is a very high-maintenance person and is very egotistical (she has said this about herself before). I was starting to feel like we would not work as roommates because being around her was becoming intolerable, and it felt like she would be trying to pick fights with me.

Well, I started saying no to a lot of the plans she would make with me, and if we did make plans I cancelled on them about half of the time. So we were on the way to the store to look at some things for our apartment with the other roommate Jane, when she started talking about how flaky I have been.

She said that people who cancel plans are rude, and not giving a three hour notice is selfish. She went off about how she has to hang out with people every two hours or she feels bored, and that I wouldn't understand because I am such an introvert. Everyone I know would call me an extrovert, so I laughed at this and said that she's probably just different. I told her that if she did not want me to cancel plans, she could just find someone else to make plans with. I waited outside for other roommate to come, while she stormed inside. I did not really thing a whole lot about it still, but then she angrily walked by me and said she was calling a lyft home (I was her ride). She was completely enraged and started texting me about how I am a horrible friend and she was not going to waste any more time on me.

At this point, me and the other roommate were stunned and incredibly worried about living with her. We had both talked about how annoying and rude she could be, but now living with her was started to seem impossible. So, without telling her, we drove to the leasing office and changed the lease. She complained to the management staff when we weren't placed together and they told her that it was because we requested to not live with her anymore. This made her livid and she ended up being placed in a room with two random ""middle-aged men"" roommates. 

So right now, Maria hates me and says we screwed her over. She is left last minute trying to find a new living situation and most people already have their living figured out, so I know we have placed her in a horrible situation. But I do feel like living with her would have ended very badly and I can't imagine all of the fighting that would have occurred.

Around the beginning of May, my boss assigned me an important project to work on that was going to be due around two weeks from the start date. At the same time, they’ve been pushing around 5-6 projects at a time on me even though I’m fairly new at this job, I’ve been there for about 2 1/2 months. My boss has been telling me not to worry about the big project and work on the little projects I have. About a day ago, my boss basically says I have to get the important project done on time or they’re going to ream me out. I’m almost done with the big project, but I’ve had to ask for extension days to try to complete it to the best of my ability. I’ve also been picking up the slack for missing employees.

So I did, and then when dinner came she ate the entire thing and said it was good, and she seemed like she really enjoyed it. But after dinner my dad couldn't keep his mouth shut and said, ""guess what? I made it with ranch"" as I kind of joking, 'see it's not that bad' moment.

bw40y9	2019-06-02 23:52:45	throwaway3084e7	AITA for watching VR porn?	"throwaway because the wife uses reddit on occasion and might recognize my user name.  
  
we've been married about 8 years. She's not a prude in bed, but not what I'd call adventurous. That's partly on me, I don't communicate my wants very well. I'm fine admitting I have a problem with that.  
  
I bought an oculus rift last year and of course porn is a big thing. My wife has zero interest in gaming so she's been totally hands off when it comes to VR. I got her to try out google earth exactly once. She thought it was so-so. I thought my porn was safe. i was wrong.  
  
She always calls me on her way home from work, I mean religiously.  The other day I get home and strap on the porn visor. The wife gets off work early, gets a phone call as she enters the parking lot, and proceeds to stay on that call all the way home. She hangs up in the garage, walks inside, and catches me wrangling the unruly hog. That wouldn't be so bad, but the rift is mirroring what I'm watching on the monitor.  
  
We don't yell or scream at each other or name call. She just tapped me on the shoulder and asked me what I was looking at. Her expression broke my heart into pieces. i can't even describe it. A mix of sadness and disappointment, perhaps a touch of anger.  
  
I explained it's just porn (which she knows I watch and is okay with) and, to me anyway, VR porn is more voyeuristic than fantasy. I don't pretend I'm banging these girls, it's more of a 3rd party view of what someone else is doing. It didn't matter, of course. The nuances of sexuality in three dimensional pornspace are hard to express in the heat of the moment.  
  
So she asks me to hand her the rift. I hesitate, and that pisses her off and makes me look worse than I already do. I look like I'm hiding something, which I suppose I was. I give her the oculus and she puts it on, she doesn't say anything for a few seconds. She takes it off and places it on the desk and goes and locks herself in the master bedroom. I slept on the couch and she has not responded to my texts all day. She may just be busy at work but I doubt it. She'll be home in an hour or so and I'm not sure what to say.  
  
is VR porn a *form* of cheating? is it *almost* a form of cheating? is it *bordering* on cheating? Is it a variant of *emotional* cheating? Is it an asshole thing to watch when in a committed relationship? Am I an asshole?

bw40v7	2019-06-02 23:52:29	in_the_qz	AITA For leaving family events early	"This might be more of ""are we the assholes"" - I and my immediate family are textbook introverts. My extended family, at least on one side, is the opposite. They love spending time with people and doing a lot of things. We get invited over a few times a year around various holidays, Thanksgiving dinner, Memorial Day bbq, etc. I feel like there is a passive-aggressive dance happening every time. First of all, there is no ""fashionably late"" - even if we are told it starts ""around 2"" and we are running late, we'll get a call at 2:30 wondering where we are. It'll be phrased like ""oh no, have you hit traffic?"" but the message is clear and it's ""where are you? c'mon already."" (I don't mean this to sound like we are chronically late - on the contrary we are usually on time.) We arrive, there will be chatting and maybe some chips. About 1-2 hours after we get there, we'll have whatever meal is happening around the event. After about 45 minutes of eating, people start to clean up - this takes at least an hour, even when people pitch in to help. Then there's tea and coffee, maybe some snack. After a little while, another round of cleaning everything up, again taking awhile. Sometimes then we just sit and talk more for a bit. Eventually, dessert comes out and a third round of cleanup, then even some more hanging out after that.

&#x200B;

Needless to say, my side of the family rarely makes it through all of this. Around hour 4 we are tired and try to bow out. A lot of times, this is some sort of issue - ""what, you're leaving now?"" Frequently there'll be talk of how we ""have to"" wait for dessert because there's a cake for someone's birthday. And now this makes it even worse because sometimes the cake is for my mom and she never likes being the center of attention for stuff like that, and says so. The response has basically become a form of ""well suck it up we are doing this.""

&#x200B;

Anyway, at the end we leave but I feel guilty, like I've slighted everyone yet again. But honestly I feel like in a way *they're* being the assholes, and there's nothing I can do about it. They've known us our whole lives. We aren't going to just magically be like them one day. We are trying to be honest with who we are. And they never want to listen. Sometimes they will and adjust their behavior for a little while, but it always falls back. And I get the impression if I pressed further it would *not* be taken as constructive criticism, they would be insulted. I guess I'm not really asking for suggestions on what to do because I don't necessarily think there is anything to do but learn to live with it, but AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Person A told me that person B hates being a girl. There were also lots of rumours about person B transitioning. I genuinely believed them.

A month or so later, person A makes a thing on Instagram saying ‘ship for ship’ everyone is shipping her with this random dude (Who was not person B). I wanted to spice things up and so, without thinking, I typed ‘I ship you with person B!’

Person A sent me a DM saying that person B was NOT becoming a boy, and that I was lying for attention. She also said that both her and person B were both really upset that i shopped them together. I sent 8+ messages saying that I genuinely thought she was gender-switching, and that I was really sorry. Tbh I probably sent too many sorry messages. Person A said ‘bye’ and unfollowed and blocked me, and stopped talking to me irl. I haven’t heard from person B either.

My father owns a shop for ladies' footwear. Me and my brother started going to his shop on the last three days of Ramzan just for fun a few years ago. This year, my elder brother has been going for the last half of the month. My father asked me to come at the last three days but I've had a really bad cold for about a week and the coughing is causing intense pain in my chest so I said no. I also would like to add the fact that I'm kind of shy and introverted type of guy and I used to make up some excuses in the past but they never worked and I had to go eventually. And this is also because I hate my father (it's a long story and I always thought of writing about it here and on r/confession but never did because it would be really really long) so I denied whenever he asked me to come. He doesn't accept the fact that I'm shy and want my own space because he thinks it's impossible as I'm a ""Boy"". So I ask you guys if I really am an asshole for saying NO when he doesn't accept my personality and the fact that my health currently is not well.

bw3zjw	2019-06-02 23:48:38		AITA for being upset when my (former) best friend started dating my ex?	"I am using a throwaway since many people know my main account.

&#x200B;

Me and my ex met through a mutual friend of ours, and were together for about 6 months. Recently my ex broke it off. She said she wasn't ready to have a relationship yet, and that we could give it another try one day. The very next day after we split, I saw her hanging out with my former best friend who I'll call A. All three of us hang out in the same social circle, so I tried to introduce myself into their conversation to see what they were talking about. I noticed how my ex was flirting with A and making suggestive remarks towards him. I didn't say anything because I didn't know how to express my feelings.

&#x200B;

That night I saw my friends Instagram post, which showed him and my ex on a date with a caption something similar to: ""first date lol"". This was weird and out of character for him, but i was also very upset that he decided to date my ex the day after we broke up. I messaged him saying ""hey man are you dating my ex or something?"" he responded with ""yea"". I told him I was very hurt by this and I felt betrayed that he decided to do this. The next morning my ex messaged me on Instagram saying something along the lines of this: ""Stop getting involved in my business. Grow up."" I was very hurt by this, so I didn't respond. A has been ignoring me since, and posting about how he is getting rid of toxic friends on his Instagram.

TL;DR my former best friend started dating my ex right after we broke up and I'm upset about it.

bw3z7l	2019-06-02 23:47:40	cashthrowaway4432	WIBTA if I insisted on my money back?	"A few months ago, I lent a friend a non insignificant ($300) sum of money for some upcoming maintenance on their car. It wasn't a case where they couldn't pay it, I just happened to be at the right place at the right time and it was more convenient for me to pay it then and there and have them pay me back later. Around that time (before the loan) they had mentioned money being tight so I figured I wouldn't  pressure for the money back until after the maintenance took place,  which was about a week ago. 

&#x200B;

I brought up the money on Friday and asked if I could be paid back when possible, to which they responded that they had already paid me back a long time ago. $300 isn't the largest sum of money, but it has been large enough to be in the back of my mind for the past few months, so I can say with 100% absolute certainty I haven't been paid back. I'm a horrible debt collector and a bit of a pushover, so despite being certain I hadn't been paid back, I let the issue drop.

&#x200B;

I'd normally 100% know I'm NTA in this situation, but this person does have a reputation for settling debts promptly, and I do believe that they aren't trying to mislead me or scam me. I think they genuinely believe they've paid me back, and other than my memory, I don't really have any hard proof one way or the other. I know I'm an idiot for mixing money and friends, but WIBTA if I brought up the conversation again and insisted to be paid?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bw3xpz	2019-06-02 23:43:23	Aeon1508	AITA for talking taking the call of an old female friend from jail when I have a GF and a kid.	"I was friends with this girl throughout my 20's. I'm 30 now. She was really my first platonic female friend. Nothing ever happened. We went on a weekend trip to NYC for a concert together once.  She didnt even want a hotel room. We just crashed at rest stops. We were just close friend

She had a kid 2 years ago around the time I started dating my current girlfriend. We had a kid about a year after that. Things are good between us minus some kid stresses.

I reached out to my old friend because we had kids close in age and I thought it would be cool for them to be friends.  Then right at this time her baby daddy dumps her and was cheating on her. So she has all this drama and she would talk to me about it.

This upset my girlfriend and I understand but I've been friends with her for 8 years and shes having a hard time.

Fast forward to today. She got herself in jail and decides to call me around 10 am. The collect call system wasn't working and dropped the calls when I accepted. I was able to hear a voice mail, she needs 500 dollars, she has it but cant get it until shes out. 

I told my girlfriend what was going on and she was very upset. Wanted me to ignore the calls and stop thinking about. Just ignore that it happened. She said my friend had no business calling me from jail.

I agree with her. I'm upset about it. Its ruined my nice day. But it's my friend and they're calling me from jail for help. I just dont feel like I can do nothing. If she was able to get ahold of family I know they would be hard ass and not get her because she used her ""get out of jail free"" cards up already)

So I agree with my girlfriend so ignore the calls and not do anything but I texted a mutual friend and a few of her family members on FB. And called it good.

So an hour ago right as I happened to walk into the other room I get a call from a different number than the collect number. It was my friend using a different call service. I told her she upset me with the call and that my GF was mad. Our mutual friend I had message told her baby daddy what was up who told her mom. She was going to be there over night. She wanted to know why her baby daddy knew I told her and was trying to hang up. She kept talking and then I notice My GFs shadow in the door.

I hung up on my friend and my GF is just mad and says I violated her trust but all I did was take a call from a friend in jail. I get why she is upset or feels uncomfortable with this happening. But I think it's unfair that I cant even talk to my friend when they are reaching out needing help.

So I've told my GF I'll tell her that this isnt ok and I'll stop talking to her. As I type this my phone rang back to back from a restricted number that I declined and she got pissed again that this person is even still trying to call me

bw3xdu	2019-06-02 23:42:25	authormarston	Aita for not drinking but smoking?	"
I’m (20m) a second year unvi student, my first semester I drank a lot. I was one of those who kept the empty bottles, and I had 4 1.75 95% alc everclear bottles I never thought I was an alcoholic but then I met some guy and he was a dealer and I started smoking weed on a regular basis and my friends started to smoke with me it was just what our group did, but they like to drink also. 

But my first semester grades were bad and I realized it was due to the partying and drinking which made write papers drunk so I could turn them in, but whenever I smoked I felt a clear thought process and was getting my best grades ever. 

So I decided to drink only once every other month if I wanted to, but I smoke every day and there’s no problem with it doesn’t hurt my wallet I have a decent job where I make enough to get by and pay all my bills. I live at home with my parents so I don’t have much besides car and insurance bills. 

My dad found out that I smoked and is very mad with me, and said if I wanted to inhibit myself I should drink as it’s legal unlike weed. I told him I believe in the natural herb and I told him some facts but he just doesn’t want to listen to them and says I need to stop smoking and said he’s gonna make me do a piss test once a month and if I fail I need to pay him 500$ 

I don’t smoke at the house I don’t have any in the house or in my car it’s at my friends who is okay with having it. 

It dosnt affect him in any way but It makes me happy to smoke and I don’t do anything else I’m just a normal stoner who doesn’t want to hurt any one.

My younger brother (14m) got caught smoking in the house with friends, and all that happened to him was a don’t do it again talk no massive punishment or grounding or anything.

"I do a computing course at the local College and everyone in the class is very chill and emits a nice atmosphere however, there is one kid in our class lets call him egg for short and its clear that he has a few learning difficulties but at the beginning of the course he was quite a quiet person who kept to himself, as the course went on Egg got extremely annoyed to pretty much any sounds and sometimes even gestures mainly to the tune of ""In the jungle"" by  The Tokens and its pretty much became a universal joke within the course as whenever Egg was upset by one of these sounds/gestures  he would scream Shut up, if you were zoned out working quietly one of these shut ups would genuinely startle you it was that loud.

As the course has gone on Egg has gotten more aggressive threatening to kill his personal tutor, threatened to punch a girl in our class who also has learning difficulties for crying. Not only this Egg tells teachers to shut up and if there is a singular noise he doesn't like he will either scream shut up, run around the room, tell you to die, or flip you the bird. Keep in mind we're having our own conversations when he butts in to tell us to shut up and constantly wears headphones to cancel out the noise yet it does nothing despite being openly loud. 

Because of this, the entire 6th floor of our college is strictly forbidden from singing or even referencing memes. We were polite at first we're not bullying this kid but the constant repeat of someone butting in our own conversations to scream shut up at us really starts to get to you over a few months. We just let it go to begin with but now we've made little mini games such as getting up and leaving whenever he says shut up, or dancing whenever he says it as well. 

Here is where we may be considered the assholes: After all the shenanigans of him screaming shut up we freely sing the song to spike a reaction out of him as he has recently grown physically violent over Funky Kong noises (we're college students so you have to expect some cringe) So for the past week or so we've been practising in a mini acapella to sing in the jungle for the last day of college to make this guy go crazy. In the past this guy has up and left in pure anger

TLDR: We piss of the extremely rude autistic child as he keeps butting into our conversations to tell us to shut up

bw3web	2019-06-02 23:39:32	Cong858	AITA for demanding back my stolen property from a grieving family?	"I live in a sketchy area, and made the mistake back in January of leaving my Apple HomePod (portable smart speaker) out on my back porch. The next morning, I was devastated to find that my HomePod was gone. I checked my outside cameras, and saw a man climbing over my fence, walking around my yard scanning for valuables, and eventually stealing my HomePod.

The guy was white, appeared to be in his mid to late 30’s, and very scary-looking. I posted his photo in a community Facebook group, but no one was able to ID him. I never got around to filing a police report; I have a pretty busy schedule and honestly, my experience with my local police hasn’t given me a lot of faith they’d do a great job solving it.

Flash forward four and a half months. I’m browsing through that same community Facebook group when I see an article about a local man being shot by the cops. As can be expected, there was a long debate going on in the comment section over whether the cops were in the right or wrong - apparently the victim did fight back, and has a long history of violence, drugs and resisting arrest. I don’t know all the circumstances of his death, so I won’t comment.

But what really caught my attention was the guy’s picture. The moment I saw a photo of the man in the article, I recognized him as the guy I’d seen on camera stealing my HomePod back in January. In the comment section I saw some people who know him personally talking about him, and from some things they said I found out the thief, his girlfriend and their infant son live in a home with his sister. I found his sister’s Facebook (same last name as him) and messaged her.

I told her about my stolen HomePod, and how I just now had put a name to the face of the person who had stolen it. I wasn’t accusatory towards her, and did say “I’m sorry to hear about your brother”, but asked if she’s seen it around their house; **and** told her I need her to check the house for it and get it back to me by the end of the weekend.

She responded to me quite huffily, saying that I picked a “horrible time to bug her about this.” She said she does remember seeing it in their house recently (she insists she didn’t know it was stolen), but that finding it is not at the top of her to-do list. I responded saying that it is my property and that I am entitled to it back; and that if she doesn’t have the time to look, I would be willing to come over to their house and search.

She responded, getting angrier, that they don’t want any people coming over since the family’s mourning, and that “you’ll just have to wait.” I responded again that “it’s my stolen property, and I expect it back.” I told her that if I do not get my HomePod back by Monday, I am going to have to file a police report; and even though she didn’t steal it, she could get in hot water for having an item she knows is stolen in her house.

bw3w7s	2019-06-02 23:39:04	KnottilyMessy	AITA for wanting to confront my sister for not telling me about my niece's baptism?	"Background: 25f. I have 3 younger sisters.  I've been an expat for the past 3 years and usually only get to see my family in person once or twice a year on vacation.

Last year, my younger sister, A, got married and had my niece. I went home to be her maid of honor in June and again to meet my niece when she was nearly 4 months old in December. (Yes, sis was pregnant when she got married, for anyone doing the math.)  We come from a religious family, and right after niece's birth we were thinking about her baptism. My sister had wanted to wait until I could visit again to do it. I have a trip planned for niece's first birthday this August and had assumed the baptism would take place then because of our previous conversations when I visited last. My sister was taking time off so we could hang out when I'm there.

I've maintained regular contact via phone and messages with my sister and family since my last trip home, and no one brought up the baptism at any point. Again, I assumed they would wait until I could be there.

Today, I found out my niece was baptized yesterday and no one had told me about it. I got to find out because my 2nd sister,  B, posted a photo with our niece mentioning her as her goddaughter. I asked my 3rd sister, C, about it because we had been messaging and she sent me pictures to confirm. C thought A or our parents had told me. C apologized for my finding out over Facebook. When I asked my Dad about it, he said it ""wasn't his business to tell other people.""

I'm really hurting about it. I don't even care as much that they didn't wait until I could be present, so much as no one bothered to mention it at all. I feel left out and excluded by my own family. It's hard enough not being there to see my niece grow up, but not even being told about milestones hurts. I want to confront my sister, A (niece's mom), about it, but I know it will probably cause a rift or fight if I do. She's my first and only niece or nephew so far and I just thought I should have been told about it at least and not have to find out via Facebook."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I’ve [F,14] always had a problem with my anxiety. I used to go to therapy for it but stopped, my parents know about my anxiety and such. My parents are away on a vacation and I sometimes like to be comforted when I’m having a “freak-out” so I texted one of them saying I was in the middle of a panic attack. My dad texted me back and said stop messaging my mum, so I decided to call him because I could barely see to type out an actual message and I really wanted to hear someone’s voice instead of my thoughts. 
 Once my dad picked up my sobbing intensified, my dad said to speak more clearly (I was in the corner with my head on my knees) I told him I didn’t want to be alone right now and he said; “Being alone is something everyone has to go through, it’s better to just do it now.” I tried to explain that I understood that but that doesn’t mean we always have to be alone.

My dad decided to go with a calmer approach. “Please cut out the bullshit and be more responsible.” I may have overreacted and shouted at my phone. I screamed at him that I didn’t need him then, because I’m supposed to take care of myself. 

(Side note, this was all before school. They may have thought that this was a rouse to get out of school. I don’t have a past of skipping school, I’m a straight A student.) 
My dad said I have to go to school and to just cut it out already. I told him “I’m going to be responsible and decide what I’m going to do with my life” and proceeded to not go to school. He continued to text me and tell me that I’m “immature” and “a child” and that I have to listen to him because he’s the adult.

bw3v4q	2019-06-02 23:36:00	BrunoBHG	AITA for not going out with my gf this afternoon?	"Context: I'm studying computer science and she's studying to get into a public University. We haven't been able to text much since her phone was stolen a few weeks ago (and therefore can't text me) and i study in the morning and her in the afternoon. Also grandma is staying with us for a few weeks and she's been pressuring me A LOT to study harder (to tell point I feel nervous when I'm not studying) and I know I need to, my schedule is a mess and I feel it's hard for me to concentrate and start studying for real.

So, like i Said, se haven't been having a lot of opportunity to talk and even less to hang out together (maybe only once a week, and not for a long time) thanks to our schedule. We didn't make any concrete plans for this weekend, she only suggested we should hang out today since she was busy Saturday. However, since I'm doing kinda poorly on my uni, I told her i should probably stay home and get some studying going.

She was noticeable frustrated with my decision, since she wanted real bad to see me (and ofc I want to see her) and we had a small discussion where she questioned when will I have time for her if I need to study so much. 

I feel kinda bad because i really want to see her, but I don't want to get worse grades than I'm already getting.

bw3un2	2019-06-02 23:34:37	yo5himitsu	AITA for complaining about a miserable store employee who turned out to be the owner?	"Went to this really expensive niche gaming store in New York and wanted to buy a bunch of retro games. The store is really well branded and visually it’s awesome. It’s kind of the Mecca for hard to find games and a lot of people recommended it to me for my trip. A lot of vloggers and gaming personalities visit here. 

There was a really old Chinese guy dressed like a hobo at the back with a really old uniform on. He was watching everybody with a scowl on his face and looked like someone had pissed in his Cheerios that morning. He also looked lazy and out of place and he was leaning over one of the displays despite the DO NOT LEAN ON THE DISPLAY sign. 

There was a really hot Chinese girl working in the store, and I went up to her to ask about one of the games when he snapped at her something in Chinese and she moved away from me to go to a different part of the store. So I asked him about one of the games instead and he gave me the most condescending look, shrugged, called another guy over and told him to help me. 

This other guy was already serving another customer and he told me to wait a moment til he got to me. I got annoyed at the old guy and told him that I had asked him, and he should have served me and given me good customer service. He literally blinked at me and went to the back talking in Chinese to someone. 

I called him an old crazy asshole and when the other guy served me I asked him to get me the manager. He looked nervous but eventually a young Chinese guy came out and I told him the other employee had been really rude and didn’t even bother serving me and he was an asshole. The young Chinese guy said ‘I’m sorry you didn’t get the best customer service today’ and I said yeah, well teach the old bastard to serve customers if he wants to get out of this shitty job that he’s still in at age 70. The guy started laughing and said ‘that old bastard is my dad, and he’s the owner’ 

I bought my stuff and left, but I feel kind of dumb and was wondering if IATA or if the owner was."	Asshole	0	0

Obligatory mobile formatting apology

Renting the house my husband and I rent half of was fantastic... Until these people moved in downstairs. (An older house heavily updated converted into two parts)

I'm not one to hate on these people but they are very very trashy.  They are furries, and we live in a VERY NICE neighbourhood of families. This is supposed to be a family rental.  They're constantly lounging on their porch in their fur costume things. We hear VERY loud sex at all hours of the day. They smoke and drink on the porch and leave cigratte butts and beer caps all over our flower beds (I planted these myself)  Last week I was terrified to witness one of them urinating on them like a dog, which killed my flowers. This was also witnessed by my next door neighbour, luckily they ushered their two daughters (7&4) inside before they saw. 

Recently one of the 3 men moved out, and the other two are obviously struggling. A few days ago the one was begging at our door for food as they have none and he will not get a job. There is a food bank that will deliver in our town out of the Catholic church. They flat out got rude to me when I told them about this service. I have,against my better judgement, offered them to pass their resumes to my boss to be handed to the entry level manager on multiple occasions but they refuse. 

They have been begging me and my husband for rides constantly as they do not own a car and it is a 15 minute drive to the nearest grocery store. Usually they do this at all hours of the night, most often after 9pm. 

Am I the asshole for not helping them? Despite the fact they are terrible to me and my husband I was raised to help anyone despite this."		1	0

In the years prior, there were a number of times where I had sex or sexual activity with sex workers. There were a couple women who I met on a ""sugar daddy"" website, and they probably wouldn't consider themselves prostitutes, but I gave them money ""for their company"" there was the assumption that we would probably engage in sexual activity.

There were several other women who I had met through websites where people offer their escort services. All were nice women. The last time I did something like that was about 8 months ago, where I received oral from a woman on a sugar daddy site. I'd estimate that I probably had about 15 experiences in total throughout my life. I feel like I have put this behind me and no longer wish to engage in that activity (even if I don't have a partner for a long time).

I have always practiced safe sex and I have had STD tests. I feel some shame for having done this, and I don't want to tell this woman. She has never asked. If she asks me, and I don't think she will, I won't lie, but I'd probably tell her that I don't want to say, or that I did a little bit but that I wouldn't do it again.

On Friday, she was upset with me because I made plans to go see a sports game instead of celebrating her friends birthday with her. As a way to make up for her, I visited her this weekend and spent the weekend with her. Just before I left today, her housemate and her ex came over to bake cookies. I said my goodbyes to her and she told me if I needed to call her during my drive, that she can do that.


Well, after about 2 hours of driving, I was falling asleep at the wheel and needed to call someone to wake myself up. She didn’t respond for 40 minutes, and when she did I was talking to another friend of mine. She explained she was too busy helping her housemate and her ex bake the cookies. (They started at like 1pm, and she got back to me at like 5:20). She said she was very sorry and all that but I just didn’t wanna talk to her.

So more about her ex. They “dated” 3 years ago for a about year. I say “dated” because she wasn’t even sure if they were together or not, but they still had a fling. Anyway, they broke up and we got together a couple months after. However, 6 months into our relationship, she admitted to still having feelings for her ex because he took her virginity. A year later she explained that she now had zero feelings for him and that she only loved me. But I’m still insecure when they hang out. It’s not like they can just not hangout anymore, because they’re both part of the same friend group and are coworkers.

bw3oh4	2019-06-02 23:17:43	elemenopee_q	AITA for yelling at my dad	"Background:

My parents have been married for almost 25 years now I don't remember a day without them fighting over the most trivial things. For example (this literally happened last week), my mom ordered pizza for dinner and my dad didn't like it. He said she was gonna starve him and swore at her. Literally over pizza. My mom's learned to take it and ignore him. 

Jump to today where we're moving furniture around the house. My dad's looking for a thing and my mom says she knows where it is and goes to grab it. My dad shoves her and she says ""don't push me"" like any normal person would (right?). He gets livid after hearing that.  Note that I'm standing right there and it's obvious she didn't even say that in an aggressive way (and even if she did, I think she'd be justified). He's yelling things like he can't live with her and they should get a divorce, and that they already talked about this before and she shouldn't speak back to him because she's his wife (pretty sure he thinks he's like some sort of Alpha male or some shit. Like ""traditional husband/wife relations"" where the husband is the ""man"" of the house. I don't know how to explain it but I think you get the gist) . He's saying things like this for 10 minutes. That's when I've had it. I say something like ""ok relax. You've been yelling for 10 minutes when she literally said 1 sentence to you. Not to mention she's been apologizing this whole time (and she was)."" He says ""I've had it with her. She can't say that to me she's my wife and she has no respect for me"" or something. Anyway then I'm pissed off. I raised my voice and said ""You can't keep treating her like this. She did nothing wrong. How can you possibly think you're justified in yelling at her. You have no respect for her yet she has so much for you. She does what you ask her and she's always pulling your weight for you (she's always doing stuff like cooking and taking care around the house after work while he literally just watches TV or YouTube. Occasionally he does chores for her but not often)."" I honestly didn't say much but I was loud and repeated those points over and over in retaliation to whatever he said (I was way louder than I even thought I could talk). I don't remember much of what he said but I know I was speaking over him and ignoring my mom's pleads to let it go. I honestly don't think I said anything false.  I've never spoken up to him before and I was shaking (the adrenaline probably didn't help). I probably sounded scary but I wasn't going to do anything (physically I mean). My mom said I sounded threatening and that I need to apologize for speaking back to my dad (again, big culture thing). I should also mention he helps pay for uni and other bills. 

AITA for speaking up to him? My mom thinks so even though I did it for her :(  they're still fighting downstairs and I'm scared they're going to get a divorce. Did I just ruin a marriage? Help :("	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw3nys	2019-06-02 23:16:21	Fret87654321	AITA A runner screamed at me because I was looking at my phone	"
This week I was walking to my new job and realized that it was taking longer than I thought. Not wanting to be late, I opened Google Maps and tried to check my ETA. Unfortunately, it was drizzling and the touchscreen wasn't cooperating, so I was doing that annoying half-walk that people do while staring at their phones, my fault.

Then out of the corner of my eye I see a big, jocky runner in one of those fuzzy headbands barreling toward me. I freeze, thinking he'll go around me, but then realize there's an old lady a bit behind me in a way that creates a sort of weaving situation for the guy, so instead of slowing down and going around me, he purposely stops an inch or two from knocking me down and shouts, ""What the FUCK, man"" right in my face.

Then he resumes running, and I resume checking my ETA, almost as a defensive measure, and presumably he turned around to see if I was still on my phone, because a few seconds later I hear him scream, ""Get off your FUCKING phone, FUCKER"" as he runs into the distance.

It was like the bully-in-the-hallway cliche that I never actually experienced in middle school, and I'm no small guy. It kind of ruined my walk. On top of that, Google Maps ended up showing that I didn't have time to stop for a quick coffee. Tragedy, I know. Yes, I was shitty for walking with my nose buried in my phone. At the same time, why was he running at 5-minute mile speed on a crowded urban sidewalk? Maybe that's why he was so frustrated.

Anyway, I'm just wondering about proportions, like an insurance company determining fault percentages. How much of an asshole was each person here? I don't think I deserved to get screamed at, maybe just flicked off or something, and it made the world seem a little darker for a minute or two, but I thought I'd ask you guys what you think.

bw3n49	2019-06-02 23:14:06		AITA for fitting two cars in my assigned parking spot?	"My fiance and I have owned the ground floor unit of a 4 unit apartment building for 3 years. There is an informal ""condo association,"" but the rules are unclear. 

Our unit came with an unattached garage parking space behind the building. Two of our three neighbors also have unattached parking garages and park one car in each of those garages, but one of them does not drive and rents it out to third parties. Our remaining neighbor Jim does not have an unattached garage and parks his two sedans in a parking spot next to ours. There is also a ""guest spot"" that is parallel to the building itself, usually reserved for friends/family that park overnight.

For about two of those years, my fiance was the only one utilizing our unattached garage (he has a 2015 Ford F150). About a year ago, the opportunity presented itself for me to purchase an inexpensive sedan (2005 Ford Focus), so I did. I began parking it behind my fiance's truck, so that his truck jutted out from the unattached garage. There is still ample room for cars to get back and forth.

My neighbor Jim started complaining that our cars were sticking out too much and that it was making it difficult for other neighbors to back in/out of their spaces. He suggested that I park the car in the ""guest spot"" parallel to the building. I happily obliged.

Months later Jim approached me and said he was no longer happy with me parking the car in the guest spot. He suggested that our neighbor who rents out her spot may allow me to park in her garage space. I said I was not going to pay rent to park my car (parking spots in our city run as much as $200/month) but that I would talk to her. 

Today we are dealing with a frustrating sewage backup (not our fault), which Jim knows about. As we were talking to Jim about the situation, he turned the conversation to the parking problem. I told him that I hadn't had time to ask our other neighbor about parking in the garage, but he said it was too late and that she'd already found a renter. We proceeded to have a circular conversation where Jim was providing no solutions but just complaining about the fact that I always park in the guest spot. I told him that I would happily resume parking either behind or in front of my fiance, but he wasn't okay with that anymore. I said that if he can park two cars in his spot, than so can we. There's only a 4 foot difference in the length of his cars and our cars. We went back and forth for awhile. I said I felt like I was on the stand in a courtroom, and was tired of arguing. I told him that I will park alongside the building, behind my fiance's truck, or in front of my fiance's truck. He finally said that parking behind my fiance's truck was the best out of the three options, and we all stormed off in separate directions.

In the past, Jim let me borrow his guitar. I've baked him cookies. It doesn't feel good to have bad blood between us. I want to make the situation right. Reddit, AITA?"	Asshole	1	0

My fiancé works full time, usually 45-50 hours a week. I work part time, about 10-15 hours a week. I always do the house work (dishes, laundry, vacuum etc.) He does change the litter box and takes out the garbage. I don’t mind doing all the house work because he works a manual labor job and pays for almost everything. 

This weekend he had his kids and they were particularly awful. So much fighting and screaming and whining and stupid decisions that resulted in us having to do all this extra work. I know he’s exhausted, and so am I. I visited my parents overnight on Friday, and came home Saturday night to a sink over flowing with dishes. So I did them. Then I wake up this morning after spending the night crying myself to sleep in our room and the sink is over flowing again. I think he’s probably expecting I’ll do them, because I always do, but I don’t want to. It’s his kids that made them all. I’ve already did the laundry, cleaned the bathroom (which includes his kids pee off the floor), and vacuumed. I also spent hours looking for our cats after his son left the door open and they ran away.

It didn't really work and once I got back and ate, I left (I should note that I did bring some fruit and drinks for everyone else, I'm no moocher). I felt pretty bad about it, but I really felt like I needed to leave.

bw3k6e	2019-06-02 23:06:16	SullyFeelinBlu	AITA for freaking out at wife over finances?	"Little bit of background here.... my wife is 23 and I’m 21. We had our first child 2 years ago, in a very poor financial state.

She comes from a family with very poor financial ways. Her parents are mid 50’s with no savings and will likely never retire. Her grandparents were the same way. They just are not good with money at all, that being said, I made this clear to my wife that this is not the life I want to lead.

When we found out we were pregnant, I was fortunate to have gotten a fantastic sales job where I make good money for my age. I worked that job as well as two others and have been able to build up our savings in excess of 20k. We have now used that money to buy a house—which we felt like was a smart investment. 

My wife also has kept her account from when she was single and I put 200$ every paycheck into that account, for a savings cushion. 

My wife, mainly stays home with our daughter but works a nanny job 3 days a week, making roughly 100$ a week, or 400$ a month. She has always done little things like, telling me the groceries cost 20$ when they cost 50. Or telling me she bought shoes for x amount of dollars when in reality it cost much more than that. She fudges numbers a lot.

This all came to a peak in February when we were putting all the money down for our home and she told me we had 1.5k in her account. I was stoked. I logged in on her phone to make a transfer to my account for the utilities bill and she only had 200$ in the account. I was livid. We had a long discussion and she promised to not fudge numbers and lie to me about “her” account balance again. I accepted it and have believed her and moved on. 

Fast forward to today, we hardly have anything in our joint account (the one with formerly over 20k) as a result of emptying it for our house down payment and she says we now have 3k in her account, but she seemed very unconvincing in saying it and wouldn’t show me the account numbers (which if you think is wrong, then please let me know as she says it’s controlling) and I accused her of being dishonest again for not being willing to divulge how much is in her account. 

This screams red flags to me and she says I am being an asshole for not trusting her, but I feel like given our history, where she is extremely dishonest regarding money, I have every right to see “her” account. I feel like we need to communicate all of OUR finances to know where we stand and that means that I need to know exactly how much money we have. 

So Reddit, AITA here? I am seriously considering divorce. My mother wracked up thousands of dollars of credit card debt behind my fathers back and as a result this hits very close to home for me—the sense of being mislead in regards to money."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I live in an apartment away from my parents, and on the day of her funeral I told my mom on the phone that I didn't want to go. I was dealing with her death in my own way for closure. I just didn't want to go for my own personal reasons on my way on handling her death. When I told my mom, she yelled at me a lot and I hung up on her. She tried calling me back and blew up my phone, but I placed my phone somewhere else and went to lay down and rest. After her funeral, I talked to her and she called me horrible for skipping out on her service and that I had owed it to my sister and our family to go to her funeral, especially since we were close.

bw3ixq	2019-06-02 23:02:48	coeurdumon	AITA for leaving a bad review of my old job after getting fired	"So I worked at my previous job for 21 months, starting in Customry Service and ending up in their bookkeeping team. It was an opportunity to grow my experience and become more employable, plus everyone in my life was telling me that finance jobs are sought after.


Quite soon after joining, it became clear that this was a toxic environment. The managers had favourites and would be rude and condescending to those they didn't like. There were unrealistic targets in terms of phones and emails (you were meant to be done on the phone and with your notes within three minutes. Most clients took three minutes to explain their issue). Bathroom breaks were closely monitored, as were tea breaks, and you weren't allowed to look at your phone, even for emergencies. This resulted in me not knowing that my grandad was very ill and had a bleed on his brain until I left work, 6 hours after he had been rushed to hospital.


When I had been there for 18 months, they announced that they were changing the teams to be smaller and have 1 bookkeeper and 1 accountant on each team. It was easy to work out that this meant some people would be fired.


Five people got let go in the space of two months. Then, one Friday morning, I was called into a meeting room, told that I was too shy and my performance targets weren't satisfactory. I was told that they would give me a month's pay in lieu if I didn't talk to anyone and left straight away. I was given five minutes to collect myself, and then was escorted back to my desk to collect my things and out of the door.


It took me a couple of weeks to get over how it had happened. During that time, the anger helped drive me to look for work.


Once I felt calmer, I posted a review of the company on a job hunting website. I listed the pros and cons, and was fair. I pointed out that multiple people had been kicked out without warning.


A week later, while on lunch at my new job, I got a call from my old manager.


She said that I was being unfair, and that not everyone had had such a bad experience. I pointed out that multiple reviewers had left harsher reviews, and got the response: 'I'm not talking about them, I'm talking about you.'


I wouldn't admit that it was me, and she said that whoever had posted the review was an asshole who had ruined her life, and she'd find out who was behind every one of those reviews.


I feel like I was fair, but now I'm worried. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"My brother who is younger than me is generally way better looking than me but that’s ok. He’s a chill dude and my best friend. One of my biggest problems with him however is how whenever we go out he treats me like his own personal photographer. Like he will just stop anywhere and ask for a picture and will pose in a certain way. He’s super preferential and makes me do things like squat down in public just to get a photo of him. I’m sure it makes me look weird but I guess he just doesn’t care. He will make me do at least 3 pictures per location and it does irritate me a lot. I don’t ask him to take many photos of me. I don’t think I look the best in photos so I don’t have him take very many. Maybe like 1 or 3 at most. He also gets annoyed when they don’t come out the way he wants and says stuff to me. I’ve gotten more annoyed at his arrogant behavior whenever he makes me take pictures. I think it was one day in SF I went with my family and like he was making me stop at random locations and my family would get pissed. At one point I was fed up and I just said no and that he was being a selfish prick who only cares about himself. I also said ask your friends, just cause I’m your brother doesn’t mean you treat me like that. If you want someone to take a photo for you ask your friends or hire someone. But if you want from me you have to stop being such an arrogant bitch. I’m not your personal photographer so stop treating me like that. My parents heard everything and my mom scolded my bro for his behavior. Meanwhile my dad reprimanded me for cursing. Keep in mind I wasn’t yelling, but the anger and irritation was clear in my voice. My brother got mad at me and later on I said sorry.

AITA for telling my brother to stop treating me like his own personal photographer?

Also he for the past 2 days kept begging me to come with him to this area near my house. He went there 2 days ago with his friends but complained their photos weren’t good tho I looked at them and they were fine. I knew he would treat me like his personal photographer and act the same way so I kept saying no. He was persistent and I eventually said yes. Luckily I got really busy with school so I wasn’t allowed to go."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw3hd4	2019-06-02 22:58:43		AITA for getting angry w/ a girl I work with?	"We’re students club organizing an MUN. I(20F)was SG for prev. year and Ari(19F)is editor-in-chief for our magazine.

MUN’s a huge event but the organizers(the Secretariat)are tight-knit community itself,praised for forging strong family ties.

Last summer I worked w/ a guy(Drew,23M)who took most demanding job but was horrible at it. I’ve pointed out his mistakes but he was like ‘if you don’t approve of my approach why would you keep me?’ and I was like ‘that’s sabotage’ but he unapologetically kept fucking up. We fixed his mess for 3 months and if I hand’t convinced the supervisor to sack him, the MUN would be fucked.

There was also a story about a girl(Rita, 18F)who I had a conflict with, involving both personal and work issues. Drew and Rita are both Ari’s besties. First I was concerned about it but let it pass because I can’t dictate her who to be friends with. Then I was told Ari, Drew and Rita keep talking shit about me and MUN, but decided not to act on it because I didn’t want people to think I’m repressing Rita for the bf story and Ari for being friends with her. 

Come May and Ari decides to make an issue about how MUN unites people. One of the articles - interview with S. members of many years and their insight of the MUN. One of the respondents - Drew who has only been in the S. for a year and got kicked out for a massive fuck-up. In the article he shits on this years’ MUN saying the delegates aren’t as good they used to be and the chairs are unmotivated and unwilling to do what it takes. In same issue Rita is the editor of the English section and  she’s not good at it so there are gems like ‘Esterday’, articles in headlines and so on. 

I’m infuriated because 1)person who made much harm to the MUN dares to shit on it without even watching the preparation process and Ari gives him a platform for that, knowing full well what he did, and in an official MUN magazine ffs 2) a person who’s terrible at English is editing it - and poorly. Just cos they’re Ari’s besties. And cos Ari ‘believes in diversity of opinions’ and ‘purpose of journalism is to fuel discussion’. And she didn’t even get the supervisor’s or the new SG’s approval before publishing

So I see the issue in the S. group chat that’s 100+ people and I’m 1st to point out everything wrong with the interview. But as for the English article, I write ‘Nah, not gonna pick on that. My besties are chairs and Ari’s bestie is an editor despite barely having B1 in English. We’re all humans.’ When Ari says she published Drew’s speech not to seem hypocritical, I say it’s same as if I wrote ‘Ari sucks dicks’ on her door and she put her signature on that so as not to seem hypocritical. 

The next day she unfriended me on Twi&IG. Now I’m thinking I was too hard on her. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bw3h32	2019-06-02 22:57:52		AITA for ghosting a friend for this reason?	"Background: This guy \[now mid-20's\], who I will refer to as Smith and I met at a brony convention in the early 2010’s. Yes, I’m a former pegasister until 5 years ago when I lost interest and moved on with my life.

&#x200B;

Despite losing interest in MLP I still kept in contact with Smith. A couple of years ago life started getting rough for him when he had to leave the state and he and his mother had little money. They moved from state-to-state looking for permanent residence. I would talk to him on the phone and let him vent and keep mostly quiet about my own issues because I knew he was struggling and I felt sorry for him. He would still talk a lot about MLP and although I didn’t want to talk about the show or the fandom any longer I still just let him talk because it seemed to make him feel better. He also didn’t really have a lot of irl friends and told me many of them wouldn’t talk to him on the phone anymore because according to him, they couldn’t emphasize with what he was going through.

&#x200B;

However there would be times during our one-hour conversations where I would try to drop some hints without being rude that I wanted to talk about something else, but I thought I was doing him a favor by keeping an open ear because he didn’t seem to have a lot of friends at that point. Smith also had asperger’s which was why he didn’t pick up on some of my cues, especially during moments on the phone where it was a one-sided conversation and I had nothing to comment on the happenings in the brony fandom because I literally had no idea what was going on.

&#x200B;

But there was one incident in particular that motivated me to ghost him. Last year I was in a really rough spot. Long story short my family and I were economically struggling as well and we almost lost our home. He wanted to call but I was in a particularly bad mood that day and since I always listened to him I started ranting a bit and then proceeded to shout at me on the phone: ""Stop! Stop! Stop! You never annoy me but you're annoying me right now!"" just for speaking two sentences about my situation and then proceeded to talk about MLP some more. I really regret not speaking up when he shouted at me. I suppose I didn’t say anything because I was shocked he would yell at me. I thought it was extremely rude. I also took some issues with some of his homophobic views, him once telling me that “being gay is wrong” and that he judges people just for being gay. I’m not lesbian or bisexual myself but I thought it was rather blunt. I never said anything about that to him, either.

&#x200B;

Finally some months ago I had to change my phone number because I was being harassed by a family member and I chose not to inform Smith I had a new number. I also removed him on Discord as we never communicated on there once. My boyfriend said I did the right thing, but I still have doubts."		1	0

bw3gdh	2019-06-02 22:56:01	tempest_36	AITA for not taking my friend to a crisis center?	"About a year ago, my best friend delved into some heavy drug usage and developed psychosis. She had moved to a major city with me while I was finishing law school, but she didn't know anyone there and made few connections. She claims that due to loneliness she began taking edibles because I couldn't hang out as frequently as she would have liked.

She soon became divorced from reality and lost her job. When she was on the verge of homelessness, I contacted her parents and said she needed mental health care. I tried to talk to my friend about this but she was in complete denial. I couldn't reason with her and was dealing with my own stress of finals. When I found out her folks got her a hotel for a few days, I breathed a sigh of relief and went back to focusing on school. However, her mental health continued on a downward spiral and she was forced to move back home with her parents. Our friendship suffered and I only recently reconnected with her.

She now claims that I could have done more to help her like getting her hospitalized or taking her to a crisis clinic. My thought process was that if she was in such deep denial then she'd never admit to a healthcare professional that she was a danger to herself or others to get committed. I thought I did all I could by communicating with her parents and attempting to reach out to her therapist, but to no avail. She claims I passed her off to her parents and that I was a bad friend.

bw3eqk	2019-06-02 22:51:32		AITA For trying to reach out?	"So, I have a friend who has found herself in a 'bad crowd' for lack of a better term - they're very much devoted to getting totally out of their heads every night.

As soon as this crowd appeared in the friend's life, he has been completely unreachable, he's been blanking me and acting as if I didn't exist.

His mental health isn't the best and seeing him snort cocaine every night on his social media sparks concern, so I messaged his mother and was very civilised. I basically said that I was concerned for his safety and that every time I tried to tell him that, he blanked me, and that it made me feel terrible to see him go through that.  I just wanted his mother to know so she could maybe help him.

I then get an extremely angry series of messages from the friend, word for word ""I'm an adult, why are you messaging mummy?"" and ""I've found my tribe"" and ""we were never close friends"" and various other personal attacks. I have spent so much time with him over the years I've known him and we always regarded each other as close friends, he even called me his brother on many occasions.

I understand he was perhaps defensive and upset, but I'm beating myself up over it, but at the end of the day I was trying to help and I got treated like shit in return by him? He's saying I'm harassing him and I'm extremely full on. I just don't understand where all these lies have come from. He told me so many times that hes grateful to know me, but as soon as drugs come into it he turns into a completely selfish stranger.

Anyway, the dog always barks. Like I’m talking all the time. No matter what time it is. And most of the time she barks, it prolongs for quite some time.

My (19F) older sister (24F) and I have never had a good relationship.... ever. I don’t want to drag this on but she’s extremely... EXTREMELY emotionally abusive and she’s physically hurt and tormented me for as long as I can remember. I have a twin sister and she had always made a point to be significantly worse to me than her. This went on for my whole childhood and although I am past it, it has emotionally scarred me and it affects me everyday. I don’t know if this makes me sound weak but even though my whole family seems to be fine, I feel like I’ll never fully be myself. 

Anyways, she moved out at 18 for school in Toronto and we haven’t lived in the same household since. Every time she comes back there’s fights and crying (on my end) and so many awful feelings that I used to get come back ONLY when she’s around. It’s hard to explain but I have some PTSD from all the things she would do to me. 

My family always tries to get us to talk and make things okay and essentially act like nothing ever happened. I try to do this for them only but every time I let her back into my life it ends AWFULLY. My older sister tries to reach out to me and I won’t answer her. For example she wished me happy birthday and I never replied. I know she wants a relationship with me again but 1. Every time we try it ends awfully and 2. I don’t think she knows what it means to be a sister and how to treat people. She’s had issues with not only me but almost everyone who’s ever been in her life.

I’m asking if I’m the asshole for giving up on her (at least for now) and cutting her out of my life despite my parents and her wanting me to forgive her? Sometimes I feel like I am, but I can’t get past the way she’s hurt me and she’ll never understand how it still affects me even when I try to explain. There’s no other word for her besides toxic and even though she’s my sister by blood, I know I can’t see her as that for a long time. Please help"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw39uv	2019-06-02 22:38:18		AITA for insisting on receiving money from a spouse I am separating from?	"I am in the process of separating from my spouse. 

A little backstory: we have always kept our finances separate in general, however, there are several things that I have done that he has verbally committed to repaying me on. 

One: I sold two homes for him, so that he could pocket the money that would of gone to a realtor. These netted him between 10-20k in cash in hand profit. I never asked anything aside from a “fancy” spa day with the works in repayment for each instance. These have never happened, and though I’ve brought it up several times and he had “admitted” to owing me, I just kind of lumped it off as one of those “spousal costs” and have not truly pressed the matter, though I have never expressed that he is freed from that “debt.” 

Two: I used $6500 of money gifted to me to make repairs to a house that was sold. This was never returned to me from the profits. 

Three: I allowed him to trade in a motorcycle along with my own car for a new car I purchased, swallowing the underwater increase on the loan, ~4K.  He has said he would begin making the payments on the car when it reached the $4k balance. That hasn’t happened. 

Four: when we separated, he went out and got his own phone line, leaving me with the balance of the device and payments (can’t cut off the line without paying off the device.) he says this is my fault because I didn’t cooperate when he went to do this, but in reality, I was sleeping for a night shift when he called me to give the store permission for him to separate this line, and didn’t answer. He gave me no advance notice he was going to do this. I’ve paid about $800 of this and have asked for repayment multiple times, or for him to at least pay off the phone so I can disconnect the line. He always says he’ll make payments, and refuses to believe the balance is going to keep building unless he does the device cost up front. 

Recently he sold an expensive piece of equipment and has $10k sitting in his safe. I told him he needs to give me $5k of that money and we’ll call off the rest of the debt.

He says I am being an asshole because he’s likely going to have to replace the roof and ac on the house we lived in and needs that money, and that he will make payments. He refuses to discuss the terms of the payments. I always end up dropping it because I know the roof is in bad shape, he’s never satisfied with the terms I suggest, and I feel like a jerk because I love him and I know if we got back together I’d drop it, as I wouldn’t need to make purchases like I do now. 

I need the money to be able to leave this town. I moved here with him, and I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t want to leave him in a bad place financially but I’m not sure what else to do. AITA for insisting he pay me back?"		1	0

"Background info: My roommate Jackson (name change for anonymity) and I have been best friends since freshman year of college. We’ve been living together  with three other people for three years. Jackson and I get along really well, and we can tell each other anything, but one thing that causes tension between us is girls. Jackson treats girls like crap and i’ve started to notice he’s kind of scummy in that area. I tend to distance myself because it makes me upset, and I usually disagree with what he’s doing, but it’s not my business.  Here are a few instances:

Edit: Had to shorten these to meet the word count. If you need info ask in the comments.

1) He repeatedly slept with a girl who bragged about hooking up with over 50 dudes
2) He drove away my roommates friend that wanted to join our friend group because he wouldn’t stop hitting on her
3) He dated a virgin and rushed her into things. Everything was consensual but she broke up with him because it seemed like it was all he wanted.
4) When a girl he “liked” wasn’t showing interest, he slept with her best friend. And then after, he slept with the original girl. Without either of them knowing until after. Now they don’t talk to him and he doesn’t know why.
5) He slept with a girl who had a boyfriend. And then he dropped her when she started feeling bad. (ESH)

It’s come to a point where i’ve told him that I feel uncomfortable talking about girls with him, because I fundamentally disagree with what he does with them. And when he forces me to say what I’m thinking, it makes things awkward and causes tension between us because he doesn’t like that I think of him so poorly.  However, he says he wants to keep bringing girls over, and he wants my opinion on them because “I’m his best friend and he wants to talk to me about girls and he wants me to like them”. My response was slightly petty: “I don’t need to meet every girl you bring over to f*ck”

Heres where i’m wondering AITA

I come from a very religious household, so I know that some of my views are pretty outdated and old-fashioned. I again also acknowledge that his sexual life is none of my business, which is why I distance myself and let him do his thing rather than calling him out. The arguing usually ensues after he asks me what I think and doesn’t like what I have to say.  I usually feel bad because I’m his best friend, and it’s my job to support him and be a “bro” or a “wingman” and just have his back. But I just can’t defend him or even respect him sometimes when it comes to girls.

I just feel like an asshole because I can’t support my best friend, and every time he brings home a chick it results in weeks of silence and arguing. I feel like normally friends would just high-five or be like “hey nice” and everybody’s happy that he got it in. But I just can’t bring myself to do that. AITA for not supporting my friend?

This is despite our grandma warning her about FSM's two-faced attitude (she had insulted my grandma before. Never fuck with anyone's grandma.) It was a relief as before she moved in tensions were so high I cannot even stand being in the same room as FSM. Even D was so pissed with her that arguments were regular. Life is hell in the house. FSB, her son, is a total prick as well for related reasons but I had to be roommates with this hollow fish tank. C was the true neutral - C loged all and meant a lot to me and got me through the stress of having to stay in the house.

Au had worked her magic over her now-four week stay as she had somehow mended tense ties between FSM and D, despite my grandma's warning. FSM and D now call each other pet names just like newlyweds.

I had sat myself out throughout, choosing not being emotionally involved in this family. Seeing how manipulative and emotionally abusive FSM has treated me for several years, insulting everything about me while holding FSB like royalty, I fear what happens when Eid comes.

Au brings her bestie FSM. FSM would bring her husband D, which means they would bring FSB and C. All appear bonded in front of relatives except for me. I could just decide to sit out this whole Eid thing as I knew when Au moves out or FSM shows her true face in front of Au the whole fabric tears apart.

FSM could convince everyone red is blue (idk the exact saying) and my exposé, if I decide to do so in front of extended family, would be seen as smearing her name out of pure hatred. They do not know the emotional abuse.

If I attend Eid with the rest, especially FSM, I could spend time with extended family members. C would rely on me to take care of her. But I would be fuming on the inside as I have to spend an entire day with FSM and FSB.

If I don't attend Eid, I miss out on the gatherings but I would be very happy as I don't have to see that wretched face. I would feel at peace even if it's for a few days.

bw34ki	2019-06-02 22:24:30	peachysupremes	aita for trading away my 22.7k instagram account, while my former co owner wants it back?	"[i posted on here a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bt5ptp/aita_for_wanting_to_sell_my_228k_account_even/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&utm_term=control_2) but tl;dr i owned an an instagram account with my friend that had over 22.7k followers and she wanted to keep it while i wanted to sell it. 

in the end, i convinced her to log out and let me have the account. i told her to be reasonable and see it from my perspective, which worked, at least for then. 

someone in the comments of the other post made it aware to me that it’s against instagram’s guidelines to sell accounts, so i decided to trade it. i traded it for another account that has only 2k, but it’s extremely active with over 10k likes per post and doing really, really well. i posted on there and it already has 6k+ likes in only 3 hours. i’m very satisfied with my trade, seeing as the 22.7k was loosing dozens of followers a day and barely getting any likes. 

now that my former co owner/current friend sees that i traded the account away, and it’s doing amazingly, she asked me to have my new account. i left her on “read” because i’m honestly fed up with her begging me for accounts. she wants to turn it into her personal page and become some sort of instagram model, which would be fine if she bothered to put in the work and grow an account organically. i posted most of the time on our shared account, and i’ve grown multiple accounts to over 10k+ without begging.

i’m honestly debating just ghosting her and continuing with my account. i thought we’d tied up all the loose ends and finished all this, but apparently not. aita for trading the account (because she said i could do whatever i wanted with it) and not wanting to give it to her? or is she the asshole for wanting my new one?"

bw34db	2019-06-02 22:24:01		AITA for telling my friend we cant be friends bc his GF	"He & GF got together over a year ago. I made plans for the 3 of us to hang out so I could get to know her. This day ended in a massive fight between Boy & I. This was the first of many fights bc of her.

He said it was important she & I be friends. I said that was a bad idea but tried. I reached out for months over snapchat. GF would respond saying no/leaving me on read. I asked Boy if he had told GF he wanted us to be friends. He had not. I asked him to tell her. She reached out & we met at a mall for two hours, talked, & left. I tried to plan double dates, make plans with just us three, etc. In return she left enough breadcrumbs to make it look like she was trying.

Issues between me & her always happened. She was upset that I did this. I made her uncomfortable by doing XYZ. 75% of the time he was upset or angry with me, it was bc of her. This happened on a weekly basis. Instead of Boy coming to me & saying ""Hey, what's up?"" he would be me angry that I upset GF. It was always a fight.

Last weekend, Boy called me upset, GF had blown him off. Something his parents bought them tickets for. He felt like he couldn't talk to her. I felt she used her mental health to manipulate him. This is not the first time he's brought something up & she told him she couldn't handle it/started crying.

Later that weekend, Boy was helping me at a convention handling me/my stuff. The day ended with us making dinner plans. GF texted him a screenshot I posted on Twitter. The screenshot was me asking Boy to handle me & saying ""I love you."" He said ""I know."" I sent a gun emoji & said ""you gotta say it back."" His response was ""I love u too bb."" I posted this on twitter with the caption ""proof that @(Boys twitter) bullies me."" This exchange upset GF so much Boy was on the phone for 30 minutes. His other close female friend was with me & she expressed that this happened a lot. When the phone call ended Boy told me he had invited GF to dinner & asked me if it was okay. I couldn't say no without looking like an asshole so I said yes. We ended up not going to dinner together.

Because GF seemed to have problems with my social media I blocked her. I realized this would cause issues, but if it upsets her, I'll make sure she won't see it.

Boy texted me about it & was immediately hot. I called to make sure he was the one texting me. He got mad that I thought she would take his phone. I told him I wouldn't talk over text bc our relationship meant more to me than that & we could call later.

When he called, I told him I felt his GF was pitting us against each other & she wanted me out of his life. I couldn't be the bad guy all the time, & I can't be his friend. He asked why I didn't tell him sooner? I said he wouldn't have believed me. We hung up.

Her kids (13 and 18) and I were friendly, as was she with my son. Her daughter held her graduation party last night and my son and I had RSVP’d about two weeks ago. After we broke up I asked my gf if I could still send her daughter a grad card, but I got no response, presumably because she had blocked my number. So last night I took my son out to a park instead of attending. Today I sent the daughter a message saying, ‘sorry we couldn’t make it to your party, congrats, and good luck!’

bw33h0	2019-06-02 22:21:38	bwnorman	AITA For prejudging a woman and leaving her in distress?	"So I am at the gas station getting gas for an hour long journey to visit family. I had my three year old and one year old boys with me. I finish pumping and get in the car when a woman comes up to my door and says ‘hey mister’ while wiping away tears ‘I really need your help with-‘ and I cut her off immediately with ‘no thanks’ and I drive away.

My three year old is pretty smart for his age and asked me why I didn’t talk to the sad lady. I didn’t really know how to explain I knew this was a scam from the first words out of her mouth so I ended up saying that she wasn’t really sad but sometimes people lie when they really need help with something and that isn’t right. He said ‘Okay’ and went back to playing with his trucks. 

Now I know that I probably shouldn’t feel bad since most of us have been approached by the ‘sad lady’ who needs just $5 for a stranded car, etc. But after I explained it to my oldest I felt a little bad that maybe I should’ve at least let her finish what she needed help for, since who knows maybe this was the one in a million time and I could’ve shown my boys that we should help people who are ‘truly’ in need.

I am well aware I am probably not the asshole for not falling for the (most likely) scam being pulled on me. I am just asking if I should’ve confirmed it was a scam before leaving."	No A-holes here	0	0

Recently, I had reason to think my spouse and I would reconcile, but as it turned out, it was his way of working me over for sexual fulfillment. It sucked, and finding that out has really sunk me into a dark place. 

I am the type of person that really needs to recharge during an “episode” like this. She has reached out to me a couple times (not really knowing what’s going on, I haven’t told her). There were a couple texts I didn’t answer having literally no energy to do so. I felt badly about it when I received a third message from her, and told her that I was really sorry, but I needed time to be alone right now to get back on top. She didn’t reply, though I had seen that she read it.

I had been thinking that this was just her respecting what I said, but after a few hours I worry that I offended her. I sent another message to explain, saying that I was in a super yucky place and felt like I needed time away just to not “ contaminate “ people with my mood. She hasn’t answered. I’m worried that I have offended her and should of just put on a happy mood or something. So, Reddit, AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bw30uv	2019-06-02 22:14:23		WIBTA if I didn't invite my old group of friends to my bday party?	"So I'm planning on going paintball with some friends for my 19th bday, and I'm not entirely sure if I'd be the asshole if I didn't invite 2 of my friends.

In the 10th/11th/12th grade, I had this group of friends (let's call them X, Y and Z). We spent most of the time together during school and whatnot.

But towards the end of the 12th grade, Y and Z got mad at each other and the group sort of ""split"". I had nothing to do with this, I'm not even sure what they fought about. I didn't pick a side, I stayed friendly with all parties, but I ended up hanging more with Z, than X and Y. Simply because she'd stay most recesses inside the classroom, alone. I didn't wanna leave her alone, and X and Y would go for a walk more often than not. But I still talked to them everyday and in my eyes I was still ""part of the group"".

Well, 12th grade ended, and they were still mad at each other. College was up, the 3 of them went to college but I didn't, because I have something else in mind. Z occasionally asked me if I wanted to do something, but X and Y never hit me up to see if I wanted to hang with them throughout this entire year.

From previous years, they all knew I'd get hurt and sad whenever I was excluded from things (like that thing when you have to pick a partner in group projects). And to see them hangout together and never ask me once, was very hurtful. I don't exactly have many friends, so this was basically a pretty lonely year and I was hurt for a long time, to the point where I stopped using social media cause I'd feel like crying when I saw them together.

Now my bday is coming up and I honestly don't feel like inviting them. Even if I did, I'm not sure if they'd come cause paintball isn't something they enjoy.

I (20f) went out with my cousin last night for a house party. I told my bf I didn't want to drink or smoke a lot because usually, I don't like being around people when I'm too high. However, I have social anxiety so I usually take some of SOMETHING just to get more comfortable. At the party I drank a lot, I also hit the Juul a lot and did a pen. The house party got lame so my cousin and her friends took us to one of their houses where we smoked. I usually smoke really good stuff, but not too much because I don't like getting that high.  I honestly wasn't expecting a bunch of newly graduated high schoolers to have good shit so I took two deep hits. It turns out the guys were drug dealers. I only found out after I smoked. I got super wasted when everything hit me at once. I puked and sat in the bathroom for well over half an hour with my cousin and sister just looking over me. I didn't want to ruin their night so I told them I was fine and they left. I texted my bf who called me saw the state I was in. I couldn't really hold a full conversation but I told him I fucked up and didn't feel safe (everything was fine but after I got high I just felt vulnerable) and eventually, he hung up. After I threw up one more time I felt better and sent him a text because If the roles were reversed I would have stayed on the phone with him until I knew he was safe. The text said ""It hurts that you don't even wanna at least make sure I'm okay."" Maybe I shouldn't have sent it but I wasn't exactly coherent at the time.  Anyways, now he's mad at me because I ""always play the victim"" and ""I have no self-control in those situations"" and how ""He can't trust me"" He's especially mad about the text.

I honestly don't feel like I did anything that horrendous. I didn't cheat, I didn't do anything crazy other than get wasted at a party. I do know I worried him, but I honestly feel like he's just looking for an excuse to be mad at me. There's a lot more to the fight but it's way too long.

So AITA?

bw30mt	2019-06-02 22:13:43		WIBTA if I [19M] called my mother on her bullshit?	"First of all I wanna start this post on the note that I love my mother regardless of how how she treats me. 

To give some context, my parents are divorced and I chose to stay with my mother because of how mentaly abusive and restrictive my father was. The last time I've seen him was 3-4 years ago.

Here's my problem. I'm currently going to Uni and don't have a job (Unemployment rate in my country is over 30%) but I have very generous family members (Uncles, Grandparents) who give me money regularly. My mother has 2 overpaid jobs but she's always financialy abusing me. Most of the time I wake up and notice that my money is gone from my wallet, I call my mother and she says something along the lines of ""yeah I took it because I didn't have time to go to an ATM but I'll give them back don't worry"". Needless to say, she never does, so I started hiding my money. 

Without going into much personal detail, I had to do something which costed too much money. I didn't want to tell my mother to pay for it so I gave her all my savings to pay that. On 15th of May, she tells me, I don't have anymore money for this month. Which shocked me because she earns at least 15 times the minimal wage AFAIK (saying AFAIK because the last conversation I had with my father was to not trust my mother on her financial status). So in a very disrespectful and high tone I asked her how the fuck she spent her salary half way into the month and her response was ""Didn't I pay for your shit"". I didn't want to argue with her at that point so I just told my uncle how I gave her all the money she needed to pay for it and now she says she's out of money when she paid with mine.

Every month she does the same thing. For example on February, by Feb 8th she was already out of money.  

I'm always home alone, can't go out because she takes all my money, I make do with whatever food I have home, I always eat alone. She never picks the phone. The only time my mother is home is between 2:00-6:00 AM. Or sometimes sundays. She comes home everyday saying she didn't eat anything all day but refuses me offering to make her something. I refuse to believe a person can go weeks without eating a single thing as she allegedly does. 

What made me come and rant here is the fact that I'm home alone, with no money, barely found something to eat meanwhile my mother is on vacation. She told me she was going to some cheap place on the state next to us untill my uncle told me she had gone on another Continent to travel and was surprised I didn't know. 

When she's back I want to have a chat about her money mismanagement and her lies. I only get new clothes when my uncle gifts them to me, I never have money for food or anything. Meanwhile she's out having fun all day long.

It's led to him being very loud, obnoxious and annoying in the past couple years, also getting extremely angry at little things.

bw2z9h	2019-06-02 22:10:07	StayFrosty-MilkTea	AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to hang around with me or my friends?	"So around 2 weeks ago I (19m) came out as gay to my 4 friends. They are all really supportive of me and don’t really treat me any differently then before. However last weekend I started talking to someone and 3 days ago we “officially” began to date, although it’s not very official since I haven’t even told my closest friends. 

My boyfriend (we will call him B) wants to start hanging around with me and my friends and spend more time with me but I don’t really want him to. I have a few reasons for this.   
    
I’ve liked B for a long time (one of the reasons I realised that I was gay) and only just got the nerve to talk to him. I dont want to mess this up with him by not letting him spend time with me but at the same time I’m worried I will lose my friends for having a boyfriend and just bringing a stranger to them and expecting them to get along. 

I also think my friends are all way more attractive then me and have amazing, funny personalities and I’m actually slightly scared that B will like them more then he likes me. My friends are all straight but I know that liking someone else can break you up, even if you can never actually date them. 

I don’t really want the whole world to know that I’m gay since I still haven’t told my family, so don’t really want to be walking around holding hands or kissing B in public in case anyone I know sees and my family find out since I’m not ready to tell them yet. But i dont want B to think that I’m embarrassed to be seen with him because that just isn’t the case. 

B is getting mad with me that I won’t let him near me or my friends in public but I’m also embarrassed to tell him my reasons why, especially the one about my friends being better looking then me.

So I have a system: when meeting guys on these dating sites, we have to talk for a bit so I can get a feel of how they're going to be before I decide to meet up with them.  It helps me weed out some guys who just want an easy lay etc. 
We texted all week which was cool, but I do like to talk on the phone because I communicate better that way. I can hear their tone etc.
Anyway, so on Thursday we planned on meeting up for brunch on Sunday [today]. He told me that he would call me later that night, which he never did. I figured he fell asleep and didn't read too much into it. The next day, I sent him a text saying ""good morning"".  I sent another yesterday. No response.  After a few hours of no response, I figured he lost interest and or maybe found someone else so I moved on and made plans for Sunday.

He didn't respond until 11am this morning (Sunday) :

""Hey beautiful.  Sorry I missed your texts. Still want to meet up today?""

I responded: 
"" I didnt hear from you so I kind of made other plans. Sorry""

Him:
""Wow, ok. The entire day?""
""I'm sorry I was on the river and passed out early. I should have made a better effort in making plans with you. ""

At this point, I felt really bad.  He seemed nice enough and maybe he did get busy. I responded with:

I always have to wait a few minutes for her to calm down when I get off work to pet her or she'll pee on the floor. Well she brought the dog out off her leash and she ran up to me.  I had to put the leash on her to leave and well...she peed on the floor. So I kind of feel like a dick for not tipping since the dog peed on their floor but...I did just pay them $300 to watch my dog for 8 days and it was partially her fault the dog peed.

My dog passed about 2 months before we split, and we got a new puppy two weeks later. I say ""we got the puppy"" when I really mean I did. I paid $900 for the puppy, $600 in various vet bills and accessories like a crate, bed, etc, plus I was the only one who brought her on walks, refilled her food and water dishes, etc. Basically it was *my dog* and I was sharing it with them. We didn't have shared finances.

Our split up wasn't so amicable but it wasn't hell on earth between us. The problem is she wouldn't give me the dog. She argued it became attached to her daughter and I won't lie, they really bonded. Because of that, it should stay with her. I told her to pay for at least half of the money I put into the dog and I'll concede, but I only said this because I knew she'd say no and she did say no. Still she kept the dog.

I ""stole"" the dog back insofar we met at our old place for a chat and to pick up remaining things and I hid the dog in a box I brought to my car. She didn't even notice until the next day. I'm now ignoring all communication and she doesn't know where I live now.

Was I the asshole? FWIW, according to the dog license, it's under my name, according to the vet it's under my name, and all treatments have my name under credit card used. She has nothing tying her to the dog besides photos.

edit: if it makes a difference, we never had a sit down when we got the dog as to who it belonged to. Our conversations were about ""replacing my dog"" so I take it as it's mine. Plus I paid for it, etc."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bw2ux8	2019-06-02 21:59:02	xYaBoySmitty	AITA for providing emotional support for a girl who’s already taken?	"
I’m single, have been for a couple years after a bad breakup with a very manipulative person. Throughout most of this time, I’ve been flitting from friend group to friend group, trying to find somewhere I fit in.  This girl, let’s call her Jen, has always, through thick and thin (6+ years), been a constant friend to me, and we became really close.

We pretty commonly tell each other everything going on in our lives, and never go a day without at least a phone call. This is how I’ve gotten most of the information in this post.

In the past year or so she’s been struggling with her boyfriend (of 3 years). I’ve known the dude since they first started dating. He’s a good friend, but sometimes says some really offensive stuff, and he has some really strong beliefs on sexuality, politics, women’s rights, etc. For reference, Jen is totally the opposite. I’m bi, and she doesn’t care in the slightest. 

So, on to the juicy stuff. 

In her words, her boyfriend doesn’t pay attention to her anymore, and it looks like (on the outside) he has ‘lost interest’ in her. Early in their relationship, he was the perfect boyfriend: sweet, kind, funny, and always made time for her. I was in full support of them at this time. Recently tho, he’ll constantly hang out with friends instead of her, and is terse, stern, and objectifying when they’re together. They haven’t had sex, but have done some sexually explicit things (initiated by him)

She’ll often try to meet me crying about something horrible he said about her or someone else, about how he wouldn’t listen to something she said, or about how he expects a lot from her. We have a meeting place in a local park that’s secluded, shaded, and private. I often try to distract her from the sadness, inviting her to movies, long walks, play dates with our kittens, etc.

I’ll admit, I have feelings for her, and I’ve been told (not by her) that I have a flirtatious personality. 

BUT

I respect her relationship, and we’ve never held hands or kissed. (but we’ve snuggled on the couch and she’s kissed me on the cheek before!(i know, scandalous!) )




Tl;DR. A longtime friend of mine, whom I’ve had romantic feelings toward, constantly looks to me for emotional support when her boyfriend mistreats her. I take her to outings that can be misconstrued as dates to distract her from her own sad. I’ve heard about emotional cheating, am I in the wrong here? 


AITA? She’s very attached to her boyfriend, and as an optimist she thinks he might go back to the loving boyfriend he used to be. I don’t. I feel like I’m slightly justified with how he treats her, that there’s no signs of improvement, and the fact i just want her to be happy. But a friend of mine called me out for helping her cheat on her boyfriend, and now I’m conflicted.

Congrats to anyone that made it all this way.

Edit: well, shoot. Thanks for the replies. Not what i was hoping, but i appreciate it."	Asshole	0	0

bw2u8p	2019-06-02 21:57:19		AITA for openly calling people out for cheating on SO's	"Short backstory: I am in the US Navy and so is everyone else involved, and I have absolutely no filter. Plus I have been cheated on before so I know the feeling.

So I was living with a couple of my guys in this 4 bedroom house and they are your very typical Chad's. I am in my early 30's and they are early 20's. 2 of them are married (for real not just for the money), one of them just had a kid, and the 3rd is engaged. They habitually are bringing over random tinder chicks and bangin it out in random parts of the house when their wives/fiancee are not in town visiting.

Now, usually I stand by a ""you do you"" approach on life, but these assholes actually come to me and ask me for permission to do these things. ""Hey, would you mind if I brought a girl over later."" ""Hey you don't have anything important going on later do you? Because I might be clappin cheeks next door and I don't want to disturb you."" ""Hey my wife is in town next week, can I hide some stuff in your room."" One of them actually got caught and he said the tinder chick was my date. Said we had sex on their bed then asked me to lie to her face (which I absolutely did not do, I just avoided the situation like the plague). So, since they brought me in to their business, asked me lie, disrespected their relationships, as well as myself, I start the fire.

If the Navy has taught me anything above all, it is how to tear someone down using just words. Like, really make someone feel like shit. They ask me if I care if a girl comes over, I say yes unless its your wife, haven't you been in love with her since high school. One of them is super religious so I always bring God into the mix. Don't you two have a child together, do you not care about your child anymore? Imagine your daughters life with her parents broken up because your a piece of shit. Say they are on the phone with their wife or something I'll walk in the room and ask them if they are on the phone with *name drop random tinder chick from yesterday*

I even bring their dirty laundry to our command. When they fuck up, because I outrank them, I'll put them on blast. ""Maybe if you weren't so focused on cheating on your wife you might be able to be more task oriented."" And all of this has gotten to the point where I have been ostracized by a large portion of my command as a snitch. Which isn't true because if I was a snitch I would inform the command of their wrong doings because infidelity/adultery CAN be tried under UCMJ Article 134. So now I am the bad guy and what they are doing is ok. Soo, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

I have asked him not to touch the baby until the blisters have dried. He thinks I'm being paranoid and irrational and that the risks are minimal.

He is not a handwasher. He doesn't tend to wash his hands with soap. After he applies the cold sore cream he wipes his hand on a towel without washing. I have already pissed him off enough times asking him to wash his hands to know that it isn't going to happen. So instead I have asked him not to touch the baby for now. I have also had to ask him not to kiss or share food with our toddler. He got cross last night and said ""master says no"" when our toddler asked for a bite of his food.

bw2u5g	2019-06-02 21:57:04	axolotto	AITA for not wanting to associate with the new kid?	"Recently there was a new kid in my class, who I’ll call Y. Now Y, she was nice and all, so we became fast friends. I introduced her to my friend circle, shared snacks, etc. Everything was going pretty smoothly. One day, one of my best friends of years told me that Y was being really mean to her her and kissing the ‘popular kids’ ass. I wanted to trust her but there’s no proof, so I just agreed with her and said some random stuff about Y. After a little bit I kind of started to pick up the signs like how she would try to imitate things the ‘popular kids’ did and sometimes imitate things my friends’ say in a mocking tone. My friends keep complaining to me about her and talks behind her back and I just sometimes unconsciously joins in and say that she’s really annoying. She is honestly getting a little on my nerves because she would always does this weird porn star moaning thing that makes my friends and I uncomfortable but won’t stop when my friends ask them to and only stopped when
I told her to.

I know she’s just trying to fit in but I think she’s going too far. A lot of the times I sort of blow up at her and tell her she’s being immature and stuff. Later when we’re alone, she then just says literally the exact same things as the last time I blew up at her, trying to explain what she did. It usually goes along the lines of ‘I know that I’m (being) _____ but I think ______’. All I can do is clench my teeth and say it’s okay but really I just don’t want to talk to her.

bw2trz	2019-06-02 21:56:11	LoneStarFan79	WIBTA if I started an investigation into my ex-wife?	"I was married for 15 years and through that time I left the military to be a stay-at-home dad and stopped my education with a year left to move to Germany because my ex didn't want to be away from me for the last two semesters. In 2015 I found out she was cheating on me and in 2016 I found her naked with a friend of mine. I was devastated and it pretty much ruined who I was. In the divorce I received custody of our children during the school year and I receive alimony and child support. My daughters go to my ex's house every summer and some holidays. All I asked is that she doesn't drink around them. It's become a fight both summers. 

I do want to say I don't think my ex has a drinking problem, but I also don't want the children around it. It led to bad decision for both her and me. (After finding out she cheated I went on a drinking binge for about a year where I was getting stupid drunk every night.) I have stopped drinking almost completely and never around the kids. My brother lives with us and he doesn't drink around them either. I've talked to my oldest about it and explained that stupid decisions can be made when drinking. 

She is still currently in the military and in the military it is against the UCMJ to cheat. I have evidence of her cheating still and I am trying to decide whether or not to start the investigation because she doesn't won't not drink around the children. This would not only affect her career, but also the careers and families of the two guys I know she cheated with. The second one has three children. I honestly don't know how loses their rank will affect them, but an investigation into her will include them and they are also military. 

Full Disclosure: I hate my ex for what she did and I feel because of her I am working a dead end job while raising two girls. Adding school to that seems almost impossible, although I understand people do it. I sacrificed a lot for our family. I have trouble with relationships. I sabotage them if they get even kind of serious because I don't trust women. It sucks. I know that hurting her career doesn't help anything one bit and it won't make me feel better, but I believe it is deserved.

I tried, but I couldn't continue. So basically we didn't speak for 3-4 days and she was making excuses saying 'I know you are probably busy and didn't wanna disturb' and 'Oh sorry I was out all day' yet she has been capable of bringing her phone everywhere, she had also changed her tone, so I felt the urge to give up as she feels the same as me I suppose, so out of the blue I just blocked her completely, with no notice or anything. I don't want her to come find me again or anything as I strongly began to dislike her. Am I the asshole here?

bw2s4h	2019-06-02 21:51:54		WIBTA for getting a guy kicked out from my soccer club?	"Using a throwaway because a few friends know my main account.

There's this soccer club for people who attend my church in which we have fun playing soccer, and also get serious when we need it because the same people who come to this club also compete in Outdoor Soccer Intramurals (we're college students). You can invite some friends (we don't exclude you if you aren't Christian or don't come to our church) and it was a great way to bond and play the sport we all love, soccer.

So one day I decided to invite this ex-friend (back then he was still a friend) because he also loves playing soccer. This was before I found out what a true sociopath this person really is. He has absolutely no empathy or sense of guilt if he does or says something horrible. Back in high school when we got into an argument, he would purposely lie and bring up people who I had altercations with in the past saying how what they said about me are totally right (those people later told me they never said this, so that's how I know this was a lie), how I have no friends and how no one cares about someone weird like me. I ended up forgiving this guy a few years later hoping he's changed, but now I realize he hasn't changed at all.

Whenever we get into an argument, he has absolutely no empathy and says the most hurtful, atrocious things he can say to try to hurt me and make me feel as if I have no friends and I'm alone. He also observes and brings up every single negative thing I may have said or done in the past and brings it up in the argument to attack me, demean me, and make it seem like I'm a horrible devil compared to him, although the original argument had NOTHING to do with me or him it was an argument about something completely different. Whenever it seems like he's losing an argument, he resorts to personal attacks to the highest scale. And he never regrets what he's done or said. 

I ended up blocking him on facebook, but he still sends me text messages (which I don't respond to) asking if I'm going to the soccer club tonight. I'm thinking of exposing this guy to the other guys from my church that are in this club (since they are the leaders) and getting him kicked out. I don't want him hurting anyone else the way he did to me. AITA?"		1	0

I work at subway as I’m still in college and have for 6 years, and my younger step brother recently turned 16 so I helped him get his first job with me and he started last week. We do weekly schedules and have very flexible scheduling as in you ask for a day off with reason you get it off, but my brother messed up saying he could work a day when he couldn’t so my bio father asked me if I could work as that was the day I got off of vacation and on my way back home that day but I don’t know what time I will be back and I’m not the one driving back, so I can’t control when we leave. And I told my father this and said I didn’t want to be the safety valve  if he messed up his schedule and be forced to work it, but I told my dad that I would try my best to help him find someone to cover even though I’m away on vacation. 

My father didn’t like that response saying I put the blame on my stepbrother when it was my dads fault that he told him the wrong day and that I need to think of all the people that helped me when I messed up. And I responded with I said I’d help him and I apologized if anything I said went the wrong way as I’m in vacation doing other things with friends and quickly typed out a message in response, and I also stated that I have asked other if they can work it for him.

bw2otz	2019-06-02 21:43:22		AITA for slut shaming a girl for bullying me?	"I am my senior year of high school and I have a few friends. Generally I DON'T have issues with people. I am quite nerdy and a bit reserved and keep to a few close friends. Anyway there is a girl in my class who is a bit nasty to people and stuck up.

However she never really spoke directly to me before (though I'm willing to bet she has said things about me, as she does with many people). Anyway one day in class last week she decides to talk me and out of nowhere she says ''You are quite a weirdo aren't you, if you keep playing video games all day you will stay a loser virgin''.

My initial response in my head was WTF? Who even says shit like that? But after that initial response I said, ""Why do you care? Just mind your own business"". She responds with, ""You're such a loser. No girl would ever want someone as ugly as you"". At that point, I responded with, ""Well at least I'm not a filthy worthless slut like you. Go suck a dick"". 

After I said that, everyone went quiet...she burst into tears and left the room.

Afterwards, quite a lot of people came up to me and gave me high fives...they were all happy that I ''tore her down a peg''. However some of her friends came up to me and said I am a horrible misogynist douche for saying what I said and that I owe her a real apology, I told them that people should treat people the way they want to be treated. If she didn't want to be shamed, she shouldn't go around being a dick to others.

  The team we played against had a dad that was obnoxious. He was heckling every kid on both teams, not outright, but saying slick things that the kids wouldn't understand but the adults got it. He was super critical of his kid, this child had zero self confidence. I start to yell out encouragement to each kid to counter him, then this exchange happens. 

 Me : ""Hey they're kids, chill out man.""

 Him : ""Easy for you to say, your kid's like Ken Griffey Jr and the only one....""Looks at his kid raises his voice and continues, ""WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY!""

  My kid comes back up to bat and he starts the ""hey batter batter swing."" My kid hit and he said, ""man did you see how quick he got to first base? They really are fast."" I didn't want to overreact about the comment because my kid is the only black one on the team. I wasn't sure if it was racial or that I was looking for a reason so I didn't say anything. The next kid hit the ball to 2nd base but the kids don't know how to play. My son ran right past the kids and steps on 2nd base.

Even when a child is tagged out they still stay on the field and run the bases.

But this guy screams out very aggressively, ""You gotta make a play. Tag him out and send him back to the east side.""

This is where I lost my cool.
In our city the east side is the bad side of town, my wife and I both work, she has a masters degree btw. But when he said that I knew he meant to offend. So this happened.

Me : ""Hey come out to the parking lot and talk to me.""

Him: ""No thanks.""

Me: ""I wasn't asking, get your bitch ass over here and lets talk.""

Him:

I walk closer to him maybe 3 or 4 feet away now.

Me: ""All that shit you've been talking to these kids talk to a grown man.""

Him:

Me: ""Oh ok you're one of those guys, the way you were talking I thought you wanted a problem, no?.... well I do. Come holla at me.""
Him: 

If you really don't want a problem I won't force you to fight.....but this fucking guy was begging for it and I was fed up. Then him just ignoring me like I'm the crazy person in this situation was the cherry on top. My entire dialogue I wasn't causing a scene. If you were further than 20 ft away you wouldn't have heard anything. 

Then I look up and his kid is at bat. So I shout out ""Hey number 12 your dad's a bitch."" This is when my wife and a friend convince me to walk away. As I was cooling off another parent from the other team approached me and says ""Man I would've paid to see you kick his ass. He has been like that since the first practice. If you didn't notice no-one on our team said a word. My hats off to you.""

 I thought our actions canceled out but after talking to this guy I thought I was 100% in the right. Then in the car on the way home my wife made me out to be the a-hole. So I ask your unbiased opinion, AITA in this situation?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I watched the remake of Aladdin because I grew up watching the classics, and when I heard that it was being made into a live action I just couldn’t wait to watch it.

Upon sitting in the cinemas I noticed that there were a lot of young children with their families, and a few early adults like myself presumably waiting to watch the classic that they grew up on.

Everything was fine for the first 60 minutes, but then all hell broke loose. I was sandwiched between families. To my left was a family where they had a toddler, probably about 3, and he was wondering up and down the aisles, and literally crying when his mother told him to sit down. (When I say crying I mean the ear-piercing, eardrum bursting high pitch screech)

Behind me was a group of young children, roughly between 4-8, who were making a racket and just being a huge annoyance.

At the beginning of last semester of college I rented a textbook from Chegg, and had to have it postmarked by the 31st of May. I was driving home from school and had put it in a box so I could drop it off at the post office at some point. In the stress of moving out and getting everything together, I put the box on my roommate’s side of the room and forgotten it. I texted her the next day asking if she could drop it off at the post office at some point for me. I emailed her the prepaid shipping label, and she said she could drop it off, no problem. This was May 12. Last I heard, she hadn’t taken it in yet, and she hasn’t been responding to my messages. 

WIBTA if I asked her to pay any late fees brought on if she didn’t get it to the post office by the 31st? Obviously ideally I wouldn’t have left the package behind at all and wouldn’t be in this situation, but I feel like 2 weeks is a sufficient amount of time to give for someone to drop something off, especially as it was at no cost to her. The late fees will probably be around $50, or the cost I saved by renting the book, which I can afford, but obviously wouldn’t be ideal. I know that financially, I am in a better position than her to be able to afford it, which is why I’m conflicted. At this point though, I feel like it’s her fault the book didn’t get shipped on time.

Edit: she also had a textbook that needed to be shipped by the same date, I don’t feel like I was asking her to go out of her way too much."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

After I had finished all the work required, I was also responsible for registering the domain name, which I did using my own email address for convenience. I could always change it later. I used his card details however.

I ended up stopping working with the guy after he refused to pay me for the work done, though I was naive enough to have already handed over the work to him before asking for payment.

I decided to just cut all contact with him, which went well for a year, until it was time for his domain to be renewed. At which point he contacted me to reset the password for his account, as he needed me to go through the forgotten password process as the emails came to me.

This has happened consistently every year, and each time I ask him to update the email to his own, which he never did.

The renewal has come around again, and I have received an email the domain will expire tomorrow. I can no longer be bothered to go through this process again, so I am considering just ignoring any messages I enevitably receive.

I am torn however, I'm not holding any grudge against him for what he did and this would affect his livelyhood if I didn't help him renew the domain name. But at the same time I see that it's his fault for not doing anything about it multiple times in the past."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Thing is she wanted to take our dog with. 

1. Our dog doesn't behave himself around people and other dogs out in public. I love him but that's the fact of the matter.

2. It was supposed to be in a crowded public place that wouldn't have been appropriate and/or would have made it super hard to comfortably take pictures which I already don't like doing without worrying about him.

3. My wife wanted to do things after so what are we going to do with our dog then? We can't take him places and we can't leave him in the car because it's summer.

4. The last time we took him to do family pictures it was not fun. We already had a 1 year old to look after and the dog on top of it was very unpleasant. The photos on our wall from that shoot do not even include him even though he was there. 

I told her if she really wanted to we could go to the park or take pictures at home with the dog but I didn't want to take him with us. She blew up and immediately cancelled with the photographer and started throwing a fit telling me how selfish I am and how awful I am. Now she's currently crying and being extremely rude to me and this probably won't go away any time soon. 

Am I the asshole for expecting her to make plans at a more appropriate location or compromise and take another set of pictures somewhere else?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bw2l9m	2019-06-02 21:34:05	StayFrosty-MilkTea	AITA for not telling someone that I was gay?	"I (19m) hang about with my 4 amazing friends (all 19m) and we tell each other everything. I’d been thinking for about 3 months to tell them that I’m gay but just couldn’t work up the courage to tell them. Then I finally told 1 of them (who we will call J) and he was really supportive of me. Now I’m not exactly the flamboyant type, I like to keep a low profile and am not a “stereotypical gay” ,as awful as that sounds, so they wouldn’t have guessed it first. 

J was really nice with me about it and didn’t tell anyone because I just wasn’t ready to fully come out as I hadn’t even told my family, J was the only person that knew. Probably about a month after I told J, I thought it was best that my other 3 friends knew, but I was too scared to tell them myself so I asked J to tell them. When he did, 2 of them were fine with it and just as supportive as J, however the 3rd (who we will call R) was not so good with it. He asked how long J knew and of course he answered truthfully, 1 month. R blew up. He said he was fine with me being gay but was furious that I didn’t tell him sooner and asking why I told J first and questioning the closeness of our friendship. I had been friends with J for years and knew that he would be okay with it but wasn’t sure if the others would be. R was really offended that I didn’t tell him sooner since I’d been hiding it from him for about 4 months at this point

I feel really bad that I didn’t tell him sooner and that he got so offended over it. He’s absolutely fine with me being gay and is a really supportive friend to me, talking about my crushes exactly the same as we would if it was girls we liked. I’m glad he knows now but I feel awful for not telling him at the same time as I told J.

My birthday is tomorrow, yesterday he said his friends is going to come over to our house on Monday (my birthday). I was like “oh okay” and he said “did you have something planned?” I told him that I had hoped he had planned something for my birthday and he said that I told him not to spend any money ( I said that for Mother’s Day which he worked for 13 hours on so it wasn’t a big deal) but I told him there are plenty of free things to do. 
I have told him numerous times that for birthdays and such I do not want to be asked “what do you want to do today” the day of. I want something planned beforehand since I pick what we do every other day we do something. 
Today (the day before my birthday) he starts asking me questions about what things I like and if I want to go to a city three hours away (the answer was no because we have an 8 month old who screams during car rides). I got upset with him because I feel like I am an afterthought and he doesn’t care. I would honestly rather have him forget my birthday than remember and not plan anything. I feel like he doesn’t remember shit about me either. He ended up leaving his ring at home when he went to work and peeling out of the driveway.

bw2knw	2019-06-02 21:32:29	ElonDeadDeer	AITA for getting at my BF for ditching me to celebrate end of exams on his own?	"Edit for title: getting mad at my BF

My boyfriend and I go to a very prestigious university, meaning that studying here comes with a lot of stress and pressure (sleeping 4 hours a day, constantly drowning in competition and deadlines). We have been together for over 3 years in a committed serious relationship. This week we both finish our university exams, me on Wednesday and him on Thursday. We haven’t spent any quality time together for the last 2 months because we were both busy with work and exam prep. As we finish this week, I was planning to finally spend time with each other and share this exciting moment, celebrating together, so I asked if he wanted to do so on Thursday, so that he is free from his exams and I can book a table in advance. This is the last day I stay at university before leaving for a trip abroad, hence this is the last chance for us to spend any quality time together for weeks. He said he can’t make plans in case people from his subject want to impulsively go out on the day. There is no event planned, and it is not even his friend group as they finish their exams later. Literally just other random people who do his subject. Unfortunately, my subject is very small, so there are no such events that I can attend for my exams, meaning that while everyone is celebrating I will be left to kill time alone. Am I the Asshole for getting mad at him for valuing an impulsive night out over the only chance to spend quality time with me in months?

Edit: the reason why I’m asking is because he is making me out to be restrictive and overbearing, when I disagree because he goes to plenty of events without me (he is in a sports team and the often have social events that I never ask to be brought to, as well as going to loads of social events that are exclusive for his subject)"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw2k7z	2019-06-02 21:31:28	the_preminger	AITA For not attending church?	"This happened last December but I keep wondering if I did anything wrong so I thought I'd ask.

So a little backstory before I get into the events of the funeral, my cousin, Alex, suddenly died of a car accident late, last year. We hadn't spoken in forever but he had saved me when I was drowning so I felt like I really should attend the viewing.

The viewing took place at the church I used to attend. I left that church around five years ago since I was bullied and overall just felt really out of place despite the membership mostly being family members.

So at the viewing it was set up so that the family of the deceased would stand before the casket. The family included both his parents, his brother, and Alex's wife. I go up to Alex's mother and it's obvious that she's been crying, but she lights up as soon as she sees me (since it's the first time she's seen me in 4 years). She starts telling me how much she's missed me and how I should attend church again to see her. I didn't want to argue with this poor, grieving woman so I just nodded. I attended the banquet afterwards, and there I saw his mother again. She's sobbing, saying how much she misses me and how I should attend church.

Since then, I haven't started attending church but I feel really bad about it especially since she practically begged me to attend. The church isn't a bad one, and as I said before, a lot of my family attends-- I just feel really out of place there.

I'll also mention my dad lives 5 minutes away from the church so it's not like she couldn't have visited me in those four years. They also don't attend the family reunions anymore, which was where I'd mainly see them outside of church. We also weren't really close so it was kinda out of the blue that she missed me.

bw2jp9	2019-06-02 21:30:07	Alex_Icy	AITA for not always feeling like dancing with the girls in my salsa class when social dancing?	"I(18M)'ve been dancing salsa for 8 months, but recently I became good enough at the basic stuff that I can begin adding some personal style to my dancing.

The problem arose a few months ago; when we go social dancing with the whole group, I don't dance very much with the girls in it. Some of them are starting to get pissed and are giving me a hard time for this, and sometimes I feel like I am an asshole about it.

Anyways, I have some reason that I believe are fair enough for not wanting to dance with those girls, and I wanted reddit's opinion on whether they are actually valid or not.

&#x200B;

Reason 1 is;

Some of them can't dance for their life; they can't  do a basic turn or a cross body lead (a basic move) without messing up either the rhythm or their own steps. Some of them even outright stop dancing as soon as I do something that is not EXACTLY what we did in class, even if that particular step didn't change what they had to do in any way. I had one girl stop me while we were doing pasitos (in which there is close to no interaction between the follow and lead's steps) that told me ""stop doing that, because I don't want to do it"".

Now, I understand that supposedly we are at the same level. But they skipped many classes, while I never missed one, and honestly this makes a visible difference when social dancing.

As a result, I feel like I can't have the most fun with them because I wouldn't be able to add my style to the dance without confusing them. I also know that I am supposed to lead them, but I am not good enough to lead a follow that doesn't know their steps.

&#x200B;

Reason 2 is;

They get offended when I don't ask them to dance, but never ask me to dance themselves (to which I never ever say no). Even if this somewhat makes sense, they put it in a way that goes like ""You are here to make us dance, so you must ask us. If not, why are you even here?"".

Honestly this just makes me want to dance with them even less, as it starts to feel as a chore.

&#x200B;

Reason 3 is a little petty, but I wouldn't be transparent without saying it as it is; these women are older than me, and sometimes I just feel like dancing with someone closer to my age.

&#x200B;

So, AITA for not always feeling like socially dancing with the girls in my class?

&#x200B;

Some more INFO, just in case.

\-EVERYBODY has been dancing for 8 months.

\-My teachers agree that the girls' level in my class is lower than the guys', and they also think that it is due to their attendance.

\-The guys all agree on reason 1

\-I never reject an invitation, and I am never rude when telling them that I don't want to dance in that exact moment.

\-I talked to the girls in question after assumptions on my sexuality (think ""ur gay cuz u don't dance w me lul""), their answer was the same as in reason number 2.

\-All of this only relates to social dancing, in the classes I don't care who I'm dancing with as we're learning."	Asshole	0	0
bw2jd7	2019-06-02 21:29:18		WIBTA for not letting my wife get a cat?	"My wife and I are living 350 miles apart currently because of our work but we are planning to get a new place together to live in relatively soon (a few months) . I did not grow up with pets and am not fond of owning pets, but I know I'm willing to make exceptions for my SO. I asked her to wait until we are living together. Whenever I tell her that I'd prefer that she wait for us to adopt a whole family member, she asks me jokingly but not jokingly, ""Why do you want me to be miserable?"" 

She's adamant about adopting a cat right away, her reason being is that she hates where she is currently living. She's invested money and time into owning a cat despite me telling her that i'm uncomfortable with her getting one before we live together. She says that she has no friends or hobbies and that she is extremely lonely and in need of an emotional support animal (must be a cat) so she doesn't have to live alone. She sometimes has depressive episodes and is generally unhappy. She want's to put it in her tiny apartment. She also reassures me that it is ""just a cat, not a kid"" and that it wont be of any bother to me because shes going to take care of it. She would be highly upset I won't let her have a cat and thinks i'm an asshole for making a big deal about her getting one.

I think she's being an asshole for not taking into account that i'm going to have to be living with this animal for the next decade and having to make compromises an entity that does not care about me. I think that she should at least be more than willing to WAIT until we have a place so we can pick one out together. I know that she will let the cat develop habits I won't like, like sleeping on the bed and that I will look like a huge asshole if I can't tolerate the cat. Everyone she's spoken to about it is on her side and I don't know if im in the wrong or not."		1	0
bw2ive	2019-06-02 21:28:00	fearingthewrath	AITA for dumping my girlfriend for not working?	"I met this girl on a dating site and we hit it off well.  She was up front about the fact that she was a single mom of an 8 year old girl.  I was even more impressed by her that she was so guarded of her daughter and wouldn’t even let me meet her daughter until we were about 6 weeks into dating.  Her daughter and I had a good relationship and I’m going to omit a lot of details involving her, but trust me the hardest part was saying goodbye to her.

When I met her, she worked as a waitress.  After about 8 months we decided they would move in with me and out of her parents.

Within 2 weeks she had walked out on her job and quit.  When we talked about it, she said that my income is enough to pay the bills until she finds a job and we’ll be fine.  A week later I ask her how she’s doing with finding a job.  She said that she was enjoying being an at home mom.  I said “well I’m not enjoying making your car payment and paying for you to get your hair and nails done while still having to pay for all of the bills.”  That turned into a fight where she accused me of being too demanding on her and not respecting her.

So later we talked it out and she told me how bad she just wants to be an at home mom and promising me she’ll keep the house clean and the laundry done while I basically just bring home the bacon.  I wasn’t convince this would make her happy, but I agreed to it.

It lasted about 18 months and she never really did much around the house at all.  She has all of her friends and family believing I’m a chauvinist pig because she went on Facebook every time I confronted her about doing her part.  She made me out to be a chauvinist.  I would eventually just come home and start cleaning and doing laundry without saying anything.  I had to pick up extra shifts so I’m working 50 to 60 hours a week plus coming home and cleaning and doing laundry.  She did cook a lot.  I will admit that.

When I did come home and start cleaning and doing laundry she got mad at me and it turned into a fight because she thinks I’m just doing it to be passive aggressive toward her.  Then another post goes up on Facebook about me.  I don’t have Facebook, but some of my friends do and I get screenshots.

About a week ago I finally told her I can’t do it anymore and broke up with her.  She moved back in with her parents who also hate me now.

Yesterday, she came back apologizing and wanting to try again.  She had her daughter with her just to make it more gut wrenching for me to do what I had to do...which was tell her I never wanted to see her again.  I held my ground, but today I am feeling very sad and want to respond to her many texts.

Maybe I am the asshole for not giving it another shot at least???  I don’t know.

Tl;dr: I starting dating this single mom who had a job.  She moved in, quit her job and didn’t do much around the house or get another job so I dumped her.

Edit: I’m surprised nobody is calling me a chauvinistic pig yet.  I was bracing for that.  I guess I need a different point of view on how relationships are supposed to work.  Maybe I need to work on myself a bit before getting back in to one.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for the comments.  You’ve helped me decide to not only bot respond to her, but block her from my phone and my life.  It’s a sad story, but at the end of the day, we’d be hurting each other more by being together."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bw2gjk	2019-06-02 21:22:00	MapReston	AITA for not playing ‘down a man’ at a rec league U9/U10 girl’s soccer game where the score was 6 - 0 after the other coach asked us to bench a player?	"With less than ten minutes remaining in the game one of the opposing team coaches asked that we play ‘down a man’. I told him we put our best player who scored all the goals in the first half (4) at goalie and it is not fair to the rest of the team to play short. He said this is rec soccer, in an ideal world both teams would leave happy after scoring 5 goals each, and I don’t understand rec soccer. I thought ref was giving the opposing team advantages with his several poor calls. 

At the age level you are either on a travel or recreational team. I coach a recreational league team along with an assistant. We play on half a full field with 7 vs 7 in a league with seven teams. I wish the teams were more evenly stacked skill-wise so games would be more competitive. We are good but not the best. We have won, lost and tied. No one besides the players keep a tally of goals or wins. And there is no playoffs. I thought it would not be fair to our team to play down a player after they practice and want to play but I’ve only gotten opinions from a couple of 8 & 9 year olds who agree with me already. I feel my job is to make kids love soccer like I do. After the game I told the other coach that his message might have been better received with a softer delivery / if he was not barking out orders. I thought I was right but also felt like a jerk after saying so. I don’t know how spectators and parents perceived the game. I would guess that team has lost the majority of games. My team has been routed before and I never asked the other side to play short. I think TA is the league director who didn’t more evenly draft the teams."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So my little brother (hes 18 and I am 26) was with some friends on a vacation for a week and they smoked much weed there. We just had a conversation and he told me that he feels empty at the moment. I answered that he shouldn't smoke that much weed then. We continued talking and he came up with a trip that he planned and he wanted to go on alone but then he told others about it and they wanted to join him, so now he wants to cancel it. I reacted by telling him that he should tell these people that he wants to be alone on this trip instead of cancelling it. He then started to confront me in an aggressive way that I would be arrogant towards him and acting in a superior manner but i think that he came up with problems and as an older brother i tried to be helpful and show him ways to fix them.

bw2fwt	2019-06-02 21:20:19		AITA for slut shaming a girl?	"I am my senior year of high school and I have a few friends. Generally I DON'T have issues with people. I am quite nerdy and a bit reserved and keep to a few close friends. Anyway there is a girl in my class who is a bit nasty to people and stuck up.

However she never really spoke directly to me before (though I'm willing to bet she has said things about me, as she does with many people). Anyway one day in class last week she decides to talk me and out of nowhere she says ''You are quite a weirdo aren't you, if you keep playing video games all day you will stay a loser virgin''.

My initial response in my head was WTF? Who even says shit like that? But after that initial response I just went full savage and said ''Yeah but at least I'm not a filthy whore like you. I wonder what your dad must think of you being a worthless slut. Go suck a dick''.

After I said that, everyone went quiet...she burst into tears and the teacher comes in and freaks out, he asks what happened and I get sent to head office. I was given detention and ordered to apologize. I said ''I'm sorry for expressing my opinion'' and I was given detention AGAIN for not giving a real apology.

Afterwards, quite a lot of people came up to me and gave me high fives...they were all happy that I ''tore her down a peg'' and some even invited me to parties (I'm not even interested in going to them, but feels weird...). However some of her friends (mostly all guys) came up to me and said I am a horrible misogynist douche for saying what I said and that I owe her a real apology, I just told them to fuck off as well.

This has caused some tension with some of her female friends too, who said I am being evil.

Was I wrong here? I thought what I did was justified given the circumstances for what I did but it has caused some issues with people."		1	0

bw2fd4	2019-06-02 21:18:58		AITA for leaving my friend alone while she is having a psychotic episode	I've been staying on my friend's couch until her and I could save to get a two bedroom. She is schizophrenic and bipolar which I've known. Last summer her ex/best friend convinced me to 302 her during a psychotic episode because he didn't want her to be mad at him. She later found out and said to never do that again, to just tell her if we think she needs to be hospitalized. Anyway, fast forward to now. I recently had an injury and had to get hand surgery and have been recovering in the country with my family. I had to take a bus into the city on Thursday to have stitches removed and get a cast,and purchased a bus ticket ahead of time for monday bc as it turned out the friend Ive been living with was in psych hospital so I thought I'd watch the cat until Monday. However, she arrived back at the apartment Friday still having psychotic episode, refusing to sleep. Her ex asked me to stay with her constantly to watch her until we can try to get her back in hospital Monday which is tomorrow, presumably to have me 302 her again if necessary and he told me he would just get me a bus ticket home  for the following day. However today she became aggressive with me and was arguing with her voices (in her head) about not killing me because it seemed voices were saying to kill me. I only have one functional hand right now so if she did become violent i wouldn't be able to defend myself. So I left at the urging of my other friends who said I could stay the night there . I don't know if I'm a terrible person for not staying with my friend having a psychotic episode and am putting off telling her ex because I know he will scream at me and probably say mean things to me but I myself am bipolar and recovering from injury so I also need to do what's best for me.

bw2c6m	2019-06-02 21:10:51	NathanGimmeABreak	WIBTA for attempting to reach out to someone who has unfriended and blocked me on Steam?	"A bit long, but thank you for reading and responding. 

So 1-2 years ago I was very active in a particular game on Steam. I had originally bought it solely to play with friends, but found both the grind and learning curve exiting and decided to play it on my own. For those who don't know Steam is a gaming platform/hub that allows PC users to connect with one another across borders and games. 

Somewhere along the line I encountered a player that was both skilled and fun to play with. Over many months our relationship to the point where we would play together semi-daily. We had our own private jokes and gags, and I ultimately considered us to be good friends.

He eventually grew somewhat tired of the game. We would only play together occasionally, seeing as to how we both had our separate gangs and other games to enjoy. However, I still considered us friends. He had even joined in and met some of my friends in our sessions.

A thing that's worth mentioning is that we never voice chatted. However, he claimed that he was the same age and gender as me.

At some point I realized that I hadn't heard from him in quite a while. He'd told me he'd been dealing with depression and naturally I was a little worried. 

Checking my friend list I realized that I couldn't find him. I checked my friends' lists and realized he'd unfriended them too. 

I was able to found his profile through a comment he'd posted on mine. Turned out he'd blocked me when I tried to send him a new friend request. 

I commented on the screenshot he'd commented on hoping that hed be notified but quickly deleted it. I thought he probably just wanted to be left alone and respected his decision, even though part of me was sad he didn't seem to want to stay in contact with me. 

It's been a year now when I suddenly remembered the whole ordeal. I sneaked a look at his profile, and he's still active. Part of me wants to create an alt-account and message him what's up. 

Part of me believes he's not who he pretended to be, as I'd offered to voice chat with him a couple times, but he never said yes. I guess it could also somehow be tied into him dealing with his issues; but I've never been depressed and don't know as much as I'd like to about what it does to you emotionally. Question remains, what do you think the reason could be? And do you think I would be wrong to try to message him?

TLDR; person I met online and considered a friend cuts contact with me. Curious as to why he did what he did and somewhat tempted to reach out but concerned what the issue might be."	Asshole	0	0

I like both of them but sometimes I don't wanna hang out and talk. I just wanna smoke and go to my room (I'm not a very social person lol) They both have their own stashes so if they really wanted to they could come out and smoke later idk why they always wanna do it with me.

bw2bos	2019-06-02 21:09:35	Jas2243	AITA for wanting to not go on my vacation anymore because my boyfriend isn’t going?	"My boyfriend and I have been planning a trip to Mexico next month for a weekend so July 19-23. We have been planning this trip with my aunt for a month now and I wanted him to go with me because I don’t speak Spanish and he is really familiar with the area. He promised he would go with me to make me feel safe, which made me feel better about the trip.

About two weeks ago some of our close friends have also been planning a trip to go to New York somewhere near the end of July. They offered my bf and I to tag along, but personally I am not a fan of NYC. My boyfriend wanted to go and I said that would be fine as long as it was the week before or after we go to Mexico. They said that was fine: well today my bf told me the travel dates and guess what ? It was the 19th-23rd! We got into a argument about it and I told him the EXACT date we were going with my aunt to Mexico and he really planned to go to NY the same days? 

He thinks I’m over reacting, and says that he’s never been to NY but he’s been to Mexico many times. He said he wouldn’t be so sad about missing the Mexico trip which really upset me and now we are not talking. I don’t even want to go in the trip anymore because he ruined it for me, but he says I’m just being a asshole.

My sisters are thirteen (13) and nine (9) they both have self esteem issues and seem happier when away from my mother.

My mother has been verbally, mentally and emotionally abusive towards the three of us since 2014. It intensified when she began dating someone who enables this and has memorable quotes like: ""You are our slaves. Do what we say and don't complain""

I began speaking with my Dad about six months ago to get the arrangement changed from 1 week at each house to three weeks at his house and one at hers. 

He agreed and that is the current arrangement. My sisters seem really happy with it but I've seen my Mom crying when she thinks we aren't paying attention.

bw2bfb	2019-06-02 21:08:58		AITA for kicking a girl out of my bed?	"Hey y’all, I’ll try to make a long story short.

I’ve slept with my roommate’s friend a few times. Last time we slept together was maybe 2+ months ago, but two nights ago I went out drinking and we hung out and slept together again. We slept together again after I told her 1) I’m kind of into your friend can you help me get her number and 2) I don’t really want to sleep together anymore bc I think it’s weird for our friendship.

Anyways, we slept together again.

She told me she was coming by the next day to pick up something, and that she would be off by 11p from work. I stayed up w/ my roommate until about 1a and decided to go to sleep and leave the door unlocked bc she didn’t show up.

Next thing I know, she comes over, she comes in my room to say hi (I’m in bed trying to sleep) and she lays in my bed for five minutes, head on pillow down. I asked her if she talked to her friend (the one I like, her coworker) at work and she said she didn’t because she upsetted her. I said OK. Then I tell her, hey that doesn’t mean you can fall asleep in my bed! No response, and after a little bit I say “hey get up!” She proceeds to (I think dramatically) get up and quickly leave my room and closes the door with some pace. 

I mentioned this to some people I’m close with and they think I was a dick. My opinion is, she was really late to come get her stuff, and it’s my bed I know we slept together but doesn’t mean you can just come and sleep over without asking. But then again, idk if she was “really” going to fall asleep. 

Reddit, AITA for kicking her out? Would i be the asshole if I kept asking her to give her coworker my number - after I slept with her again? Is that weird? I said I didn’t want to sleep together anymore but she said she didn’t care and thought it didn’t affect anything."	Everyone Sucks	1	0
bw2bdm	2019-06-02 21:08:49	blueish_rhino	AITA for telling my classmates to stop commenting on my food habits?	"So basically I’m a very picky eater. I can’t really explain why, I just don’t like certain foods. Because of the taste, but specifically texture is the thing that gets me. 

I’m currently in a high school with a terrible cafeteria, so I bring my own lunch basically every day. It usually consists of plain rice or pasta with some meat and an apple on the side. (Very boring, I know, but it’s practical)

Of course I realize how plain the food is, and i certantly don’t love eating the same thing everyday, but I save my more adventurous food choices for when I get home. Also, I have talked with my parents about actively widening my pallet, but that kind of thing doesn’t happen over night.

Anyway, my classmates - who are usually lovely - love to comment on this, probably thinking that they’re being very original and funny. So every day when it’s lunch time, I hear the same comments: “That looks pretty boring”, “Wow just rice/pasta again?” “Why don’t you eat something else?”. To them it’s probably innocent curiosity or something, but it’s so frustrating to hear over and over again.

Usually I just go along with it, but this one day, I was in a particularly shitty mood. So this girl makes some comment, and I decide to shut it down. 

Her: “Doesn’t it get boring to eat that every day?” 

Me: “Yeah it does, of course it does. But it’s the easiest thing to bring, so it would be nice if you’d stop commenting on it every single day” (In a stern, but not agressive tone)

Her: “Okay relax, I was just asking”

She made it seem like I was being too harsh, but I’m just so tired of them not minding their own business. So, what do you guys think? AITA?

bw29uv	2019-06-02 21:05:10	dm16yo	AITA for disapproving of the age gap in my friend's relationship?	"Hi, I'm currently 18 and I have a friend who is 19. We both graduated high school a year ago. During our senior year, he was dating a sophomore. I gave him some shit for it because it's not something I would do, but I told him it really wasn't a big deal. Both people are still in high school and interact in the same environment everyday. 2 or 3 months after we graduated, my friend and his ex girlfriend had a rough break up. Around half a year after that or so, her best friend started hitting on him. Hard. My friend was confused initially, but interested. She was 16 at the time, whereas his ex had turned 17 while they were dating, and him 19. 

&#x200B;

One late night, we stayed in his car and talked about it for a long time. I told him he shouldn't pursue her, and I would lose respect for him if he did. 1. She is his ex's best friend, and they did not end on good terms. 2. She's only 16. She's half way through high school, and he's a year into college. She lives in a completely different world than him. She has friends who can't even drive yet. The ""romeo and juliet clause"" or whatever does not apply here because they did not meet in high school, or even go to school in the same district. I tried to put it in different contexts, I asked him if he'd be cool with his future 16 year old daughter dating a 19 year old. He said he probably wouldn't. He has a younger sister who is the same age as the girl, and I asked him if he felt alright with his younger sister dating someone his age, to which he completely disagreed with. Yet he still pursued the girl anyway. I told him that when he has kids, he'll be lucky guys who think like me exist.

&#x200B;

I also have another hang up I haven't and most likely won't bring up with him. I feel like the only reason he's dating this girl, and the only reason he dated his ex, is because they approached him, and it was easier for him to settle. I know he'd disagreed with me if I brought this up, but being approached by a younger girl makes for an easier but more shallow relationship (when you're at high school age like us).

&#x200B;

The age of consent where we live is 16 - so this is a mostly moral argument. I feel bad in some regards because I do like the girl, for 16 she comes off as mature for her age (but this is debatable), and the dude is one of my best friends. I just can't morally justify dating someone with that much of a life-gap, age wise and position in the world."	Asshole	0	0

It was lunchtime and there were 3 tables taken when we got there. I had never been to a Middleton's steakhouse but all my friends highly recommended so thought I'll give it a go. We ordered a starter drinks and our main, the starter came in a timely manner as did the drinks. All going well so far, so we then waited 1 hour 20 minutes I had mentioned a couple of times about the wait and the waitress was apologetic. Then the food arrived and oh my god! I went for a premium steak and got the grisliest piece of steak ever. I'm not kidding my face grew a six pack after the workout of chewing. 

So I complained explained I will pay for everything else just not the steak as it is uneatable. The waitress said I can get another one for you. I replied with I don't have another hour to wait. She said she would get me the manager to issue me the refund. 20 minutes later no manager, I'm looking around and everyone else is looking for where there orders are all building up to the conclusion of me saying to my wife f##k this we're leaving. We walked towards the door and the manager was there with the waitress. The waitress said to the manager that's the man, I straight up said you had your chance to make this right and you lost it.

Some times, I’m not in the mood to be adventurous. About half of the time, I don’t want to try anything because I’m either not hungry or I don’t want to mix flavors. My wife ALWAYS accepts my offer to try something new.

My wife thinks that I’m being a jerk by not accepting her offer to share something that she thinks I will enjoy. I said I’m not a jerk because sometimes I just don’t feel adventurous. 

So, AITA?

I plan on flying out to meet my dad for July 4th, also his birthday. My boyfriend insisted on coming, but since my dad is the only one living out there I didn’t want to make him feel like a third wheel. Usually when I fly out to meet him it’s just me and we spend the week together catching up. My bf got mad saying that we should be spending holidays together.

Years ago bob was a big part of our friend group, but then multiple times my friends caught him “stalking” us. My two friends were over at ones house hanging out, they hadn’t invited bob because it’s a big group and ya you don’t get invited to everything, they noticed him outside in his car with the lights off. He didn’t move and stayed there until they came out and then he drove away, he would also show up at houses moments after being called to come over, like he was already there waiting. My friends were super creeped out but after a while he was given a second chance.
Flash forward to a few months ago he started to seem off, he was doing a lot of acid and was acting weird but it seemed harmless. But then one day he came to our hangout spot and started saying somebody tried to kill him. He had assumed that: a Girl we know was in love with him (rejected him twice and had a bf) and because of that, and the fact that a random coworker asked when he got off work (he assumed that random guy was the bf) he assumed that the  bf was coming to kill him because of it. After that he started bringing up events that never happened to show how much he cares for us, like they literally never happened. He started showing up at that girls work so I finally told him that he needed to fuck off because he was really scaring some of the people in our group and it was only getting worse

I was supposed to go to a concert with a friend of mine and my boyfriend in a different city on Wednesday, but I can’t get the day off work. I have to resell my tickets and try and get a refund for my train tickets, etc. 

Recently, a lot has been going on in my life. I’ve been dealing with past trauma that was repressed that is now making itself known, dealing with someone coming back into my life who shouldn’t be, family issues, and both my boyfriend and I are feeling the effects of the stress of the situation. We’ve been fighting a lot the past 2 weeks and it’s definitely adding to my stress level. 

I have the day off on Friday and my friend offered to still go and get out of the city for a day. We want to go down on the Thursday and come back on the Friday. I talked about feeling stressed and trapped and I just want a day away. When I brought this up to my boyfriend he said he was hurt that I was planning to go without him. 

I don’t want to tell him that I just needed some space from everything because I didn’t want to stress him out more. He’ll worry if he knows that I’m leaving the city because I need some time to breath, and he’s stressing me out more than helping me right now. He’s going to be hurt either way.

bw271k	2019-06-02 20:58:15	repellingspider	AITA for ghosting a guy who seemed persistently flirty with me?	"A couple of years ago I (24M at the time) met a guy (33M) in a Starbucks who was sitting at the table next to me. It turned out we had a lot of mutual interests and similar careers, so we agreed it would be fun to meet up again in the future.

A few weeks go by and he texts me asking if I wanted to get coffee or brunch on the weekend.

When I get to brunch, things start getting a little odd. He is overly complimentary of my appearance, and he asks a lot of personal and rather deep questions. I was wearing a hat on this particular day and at one point he asked me to take it off so he could see my hair.

We talked for about an hour and then I said I had to go run some errands. As we left, he really wanted to give me a hug. I’m not really a hugging person, especially when I’ve only know someone for a couple of hours. He was persistent though so I gave in and then we left.

In the weeks that followed he texted me on a regular basis and would send me pictures of his place (he was redecorating) and asked me if I wanted to come over. He always was the one to initiate texts convos, and I was never very talkative. I felt very uncomfortable with it all. He would even send me pictures of himself sometimes.

He wanted to hang out again though and after weeks of being persistent, I finally gave in and said I’d meet him for dinner one evening after work. At this point I’m starting to wonder if he’s interested in me, and I’m trying to figure out a way to casually let him know I’m straight.

As we’re talking at dinner, I mention the fact that I’m trying to get back into the dating scene again after a bad breakup. I tell him about a few of the girls I’ve talked to, hoping that it will be enough of a hint. Instead, he starts to question me about my sexuality (about which I tell him directly I’m straight), and then he even went as far as to say, “you never know, one day down the road you might realize you’re interested in men”. 

I thought this was a little presumptuous of him to say considering we were practically strangers still.

Weeks and months go by and we don’t see each other again but he texts me regularly. I never respond with much if I respond at all. 

It’s now been two years and every so often he’ll text me and now I just don’t answer at all. But he doesn’t seem to get that I’m not interested.

AITA for ignoring his texts and ending my attempts at friendship with him?

TL;DR - I met a guy who I thought might make a good friend and instead he flirted with me and was extremely persistent. I eventually stopped replying to his messages, but he still keeps sending them (a span of a couple of years)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Anyways he posts this picture on his Instagram story where him and his cousins are holding hands and both drinking something and looking at the scenery ( the picture was taken showing their backs looking away).

The pic even had a caption that says something like “you’re the best blah blah blah” and then he says “you’re the best cousin anyone could have” and then happy birthday.

**As a side note I would post the pic with a link but idk if I’m allowed to do that.

Anyways, I see this and I’m like wtf and I ask him more in a playful way like joking around and he got a bit defensive and said that she (the cousin) would be upset if he didn’t post it, so I said why did he have to take he pic like that as it literally looked like a sunset pic for couples but in the day

Overall he didn’t get that mad but I feel bad about saying it as maybe it’s kinda wrong of me to say it

He was surprised when he found out that I had never volunteered before. I always believed in honesty and communication in a relationship so I told him frankly that I have zero desire to volunteer. 

I told him that I wouldn't mind donating money to a charity that I like but I do not have the financial means to do so. He suggested volunteering but again I told him I don't have a desire to do so. It quickly devolved into a debate whether money or ground work was more important. I'm of the opinion that both are necessary and equally important, which he found ironic given my unwillingness to volunteer. I tried to remain civil but he was obviously agitated by this revelation. He has a right to be agitated though, imo.

As to why I lack a drive for volunteering, the short answer is that I don't know. I don't think I'm a sociopath or a psychpath, I don't seem to fit the descriptions. It's been a few months and this moral dilemma has been nagging at me for a bit now.

I've struggled with mental health issues (anxiety, depression) since middle school (Im 18 now) and have begged my mom since then to let me go to a specialist, because it was becoming overwhelming and I was having dark thoughts, especially in my last few years of high school. My mom is very religious and always told me to ""just pray about it"", and also we are very low income so it was not a top priority for her. But after one particularly bad depressive episode, she finally helped me set me an appointment.

On the day of the appointment, I was actually very excited because i had wanted to speak to a therapist for YEARS at this point, and I thought finally, a professional was going to give me real advice, not just tell me to ""pray about it.""

Well when I got there, the therapist seemed okay at first, she was asking general questions to get a gauge on my mental state. She then asked me, ""how would you rate your anxiety on a scale from one to ten?""

When I replied, ""uhh, about a 6/7,"" she scoffed, and my heart dropped.

""6 or 7? Girl you're not even fidgeting or anything,"" she said and typed something into her computer.

After that happened i immediately felt closed off. I came into the appointment completely ready to open up and tell her everything about how i was feeling, but after that I literally just wanted to walk out the door. I feel like if she was surprised at the number she could have asked, ""Why do you feel that way?"" Or something, and then I could have explained myself better, but no, she just wrote me off.

So after leaving the appointment, I told my mom that I wasn't going back, and she of course got mad because I had been begging for such a long time, and now after my first appointment, I refused to go back. I can see where she's coming from, and I also think maybe I am making my anxiety seem worse than it is. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

She was the first person I’ve ever loved, and we broke up on god terms so we’ve been friends for a while. We’re texting, it’s really late at night and she starts acting weird, I figured she was just tired and delirious. She doesn’t like me telling her what to do, and it was a weekend so I just didn’t say anything. At one point she made a joke about me having never seen a pussy before (I’m sorry there’s a random gap here, but we’re just joking back and forth and it made sense in context)
I reply by saying “Oh like I’ve never seen yours before”
Instantly she gets pissed at me, I know she’s not sensitive and she won’t care about a joke like that. The actual reason she got mad was because she wasn’t acting weird, she had randomly handed off the phone to her older brother without telling me anything. I try to apologize but she is really mad at me. I eventually decide to stand my ground, and tell her that she has no reason to be mad at me, and eventually I’m mad at her, for being mad at me. I didn’t use any slurs or anything that over the top, just to be clear. 

Here’s a small bit of backstory:
My next serious relationship after her was a very happy and very serious relationship that ended because she disappeared to rehab and I found out after that she was on Xanax. M knows I’m VERY sensitive about this topic.

M is very mad at me and she says and I quote “I don’t love you, I never did, go back to your drug addict” and promptly blocked me. I switched to Skype to message her saying that she was being petty, and immature. At this point I may have called her a bitch once, which is definitely a mistake on my part. 
Now I know that M was an asshole. My question is, am I also an asshole for overreacting and calling her a bitch?"		1	0

So since last month I (25F) have been making plans with a good friend (22F) to go to an out of state event that's coming up soon in a city whose name rhymes with Trivago.  Two days after I bought our event tickets, we bought our airfare tickets and made the hotel reservation.  Bear in mind, I'm paying for the majority of this trip since good friend is unemployed and on disability while I work full-time.  All she's paying for is souveniers she wants and her food while I'm paying for everything else, in short.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this past Friday, I get a text from her saying to call me as soon as she can.  So I call her when I get home and good friend explains to me that now she might not be able to go on the trip due to some health issues that have come up (all I could get from the call was that she was having pain that would make her double over, but nothing serious otherwise) and had been in and out of doctors the past few days.  But she explains to me that she has a doctor's appointment this thursday (7th), that'll determine wether or not she'll be able to go on our trip.  Our flight is scheduled for the 14th, so I'd like to think she'll be okay, but at the same time I'm not getting my hopes up.

&#x200B;

So I come to reddit with this question.  WIBTA if it turns out my good friend can't go to the event, that I solely ask her for the money back for her event ticket and that ticket alone?  If my scenario isn't clear enough, I'm AOK with questions and will edit in answers to this post.

&#x200B;

**Extra Info:** Tickets to this event aren't transferrable, nor are they refundable.  So unfortunately I can't resell it/gift it to someone else, since tickets are tied to your name upon purchase.  Also the event ticket is significanly cheaper than the plane ticket, thus why I wasn't planning on asking for the money for both.

&#x200B;

**EDIT 1:** I failed to mention this but while she doesn't work.  My friend's fiance she lives with works and makes decent money (not rich or upper middle class, but enough to live on.)"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw1xcg	2019-06-02 20:33:49		AITA for not wanting to add my bf to my health insurance plan until after he pays his debt to me?	Hi all, my bf (34) and I (30) have been together 2.5 years and living together for 1. My mom moved out of her house and is letting us live there rent free. I have a stable full time job. Bf started his own business 5 years ago, it has its ups/downs but overall hasn’t profited to the point where he’s been able to save. I recently found out my work offers domestic partner health insurance coverage, which i’d like to sign my bf up for because he hasn’t had insurance for years. He got a sinus infection 2 years ago that he got treated at the ER for free, and although they told him to return for a second round of antibiotics if it didn’t clear it up, he never did, so the issue persisted. He also complains of kidney pain which is related to occasional binge drinking. I am all for adding him to my health care plan, but hesitate at this current time because his business has been at a standstill for the past month so he hasn’t made any money at all and I don’t know when that will end. Unfortunately, it also coincides with us doing some expensive upgrades to my car (something he pushed hard for- he’s a car guy- and I reluctantly agreed to after he offered to pay half). It also coincided with us taking a vacation. When all is said and done, he owes me $2000. I don’t feel right absorbing another expense of his until he pays the 2k first, especially because it will obviously make my paycheck smaller (by $100/month which may sound trivial but I don’t think it is). Background: I handle all the bills in the household and all our expenses including business/personal are run through my credit card because he doesn’t have credit. He pays me back, but usually a month later. He also doesn’t have a working car, his taxes haven’t been done in years, his drivers license is suspended, and he doesn’t have any savings. I feel like he is a little reckless when it comes to planning/spending, and I am on the complete opposite side of the spectrum (savings, good credit score, taxes paid on time, etc) which is partly why I’m so reluctant to sign a dotted line saying I will provide him coverage. He says he will pay me, and I believe him, but he insists he needs it NOW and when I say I need his debt paid first so I can start on a clean slate, he says I’m betraying him and that i care more about my $ than his health. But I just feel if he wants this benefit, he needs to pay up first, as that’s his responsibility. Am I being unreasonable to stand my ground and delay coverage until he’s paid up?		1	0

bw1vyu	2019-06-02 20:30:29	i_wear_his_shit	AITA for wanting to report my mom for social security fraud	"This is my first post here so sorry for any mistakes. 
So my mom and dad got divorced when i was really young. My mom got full custody of us kids (my two sisters and i) against my dads wishes and moved us as far away from him as possible. My dad is on disability for some injuries he got when he was younger so child support came from social security. My mom got close to $700 a month for all 3 of us and as we got older and turned 18 that amount stayed the same just the checks were made out for whichever kids were left at home. If that all makes sense lol. 
The problem here is that my mom is a very selfish person and never spent that money on us kids. To this day I honestly have no idea where that money went. We grew up HELLA poor. Never got new clothes or shoes, we always got them handed down to us from older kids in our church, and they were always too small for us. I have lifelong problems with my feet now from them developing incorrectly. 
We had a family farm (if thats what you can call the shitty few acres she could ""borrow"" from friends here and there) and would sell all the vegetables and produce at farmers markets. We never had a lot of food to eat and went hungry a lot of days. 
Fast forward to when I turned 19. I decided to join the Air Force to get out of my shitty town (sike the Air Force only sent me to another shittier town) and make some money to support myself and maybe have a better life than I had growing up. I went home on leave after tech school only to find out that my mom (who only had one kid left at home and was still getting almost $700 a month for her) wasn't buying my youngest sister clothing or shoes for school, wasn't buying her school supplies, and would leave every weekend with her new husband on a road trip to Vermont, which is several hours from my moms house, and leave my sister without ample food or money to get food while she was gone. I took my sister shopping and spent hundreds of dollars to get her clothing that fit and wasn't ripped or stained. 
Ive wanted to report my mom for a long time but have held off because my sister was still living at home and i didn't want her to get negatively affected by it. But now my sister is graduated high school and is heading off to college in the fall. 
So am I the asshole for wanting to report her now? My sisters keep telling me not to report anything because ""thats just how she is"" or ""we're alive and well now so we shouldn't cause any trouble"". I just need someone to tell me if I'm being crazy or not.



Edit: Thing is, my mom held a job and as soon as we were old enough we held jobs too. And my mom took all the money we earned from jobs and we never saw any of it. We never had much food, just stuff we grew in the garden that she decided not to sell. We always lived in shitty small houses until they got her for not paying rent and she moved us somewhere else. I've lived in over 28 different houses in my life. My mom also had stolen over $10k from me when she was still on my bank account. I promise you, this isnt just a case of a kid being mad they didnt have an easy life."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw1uue	2019-06-02 20:27:38		AITA for quitting my job without giving two weeks notice?	"I've been working at a company published in the newspaper for several years as being one of the worst companies in America besan employee reviews and employee satisfaction. Was hired as an intern, told there would be a position for me after I completed said internship. end of internship came, no position was available. Had to interview throughout the company in other departments to finally get hired in the IT department. My boss was a millennial and we thought very much alike. We got along famously. 


4 months after starting in the position and doing incredibly well, hiring boss leaves, and brand new manager comes onto the team. decided she doesn't like me, and decides to make my life a living hell by singling me out and looking for any small details you possibly can to punish me on. Never spoke to me about any performance concerns, but hit me with a performance improvement plan completely at random during our weekly one-on-one meeting. Claimed she talked to me before about the issues, but she hasn't. I beat the performance improvement plan in HR agreed that I was back on track. 


She also turned my entire team against me. I was downstairs one day getting my laptop repaired when a senior associate messaged me repeatedly asking where another person on my team was because they couldn't get in touch with them. Told them I was downstairs and that other associate shows up downstairs to check on me and make sure I'm not lying about my location despite never having done so before. Just because I wasn't at my desk for 5 minutes to get my PC repaired. Senior associate has done this several times. Other people on the team are backstabbers and have been instructed by the new boss to copy her over. For basically anything I do in order to make me look bad. Ask a question on something I am confused on? Copy over the boss. Find an error in one of my proofreading copies of a report (the draft we send to each other to error check before sending out which is meant to be checked over)? Copy over the boss. 


So just a couple weeks ago I found a much better place to work and I quit on the spot after I got my start date. My previous boss has no honor, so why should I honor them?



Tl;Dr: work for one of worst companies in America based on employee satisfaction. new boss decides she doesn't like me. No mentoring done. Put me on performance improvement plan after satisfactory annual performance review. Is very rude and nasty to me even though I'm super nice and sincere. Turned entire team against me. Found a much better place to work, and quit on the spot."	Not the A-hole	1	0
bw1uty	2019-06-02 20:27:36	brodywayne69	AITA It’s just 5 dollars...	"Me and my girlfriend (GF) have been together for just over a year. All is well no major arguments but money is a little tight for her, but for me is not really an issue, so that causes a little strain in our relationship. That’s a little backstory to setup for the events that happened this morning...

I wake up this morning and ask GF to run to town and get us some Arby’s. She agrees and I tell her to grab a 20 dollar bill out of the gun safe and get whatever she wants, and to get my usual order. She gets the food and we sit down together and eat it, all is good. Several hours later I want to run to the gas station to get a Bang energy drink. I ask GF where the change is from the Arby’s trip...she responds with “well I spent it all there” this seems odd because two meals usually doesn’t add up to 20 dollars. So ask her two more times if she really spent it all and she reassured me that she did. So I go outside to get in my truck when I decide to just check her car and see if the receipt was in there from the Arby’s trip. Sure enough it was, the goal was 11 dollars and some change. I confront her about lying and she says oh yeah I put the rest in my car for gas. I am angry because she lied about where the money was. She is saying it’s not a big deal because it was less than 10 dollars. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bw1tzx	2019-06-02 20:25:37		AITA for finally speaking my mind to a “friend?”	"Alright so I have to give some background to this guy.

He’s in my friend group, but I do not like him, I am in high school so of course my friend group plays a ton of games together. He was absolutely awful to me throughout last year (freshmen year), and has overall not been a good person to me.

Now one thing you should know about me, I’m a pretty big guy, I’m above 6 feet, and the “friend” I’m talking about is extremely small and wiry, so physically he can’t do much to me, even though he’s threatened in the past.

So my friend group and I have set up a server in a game and we generally don’t get in many fights, we might fuck around with each other a bit, but nothing too serious. I decide to plant a farm next to his house because he was complaining about food. The farm was probably too big, and here’s where the wrong turn takes. 

A day after I plant the farm he joins the Xbox party and yells at me for two straight minutes calling me “insecure”, “immature” and a dick to him for no reason. He leaves and then sends me a text half an hour later asking why I’m always an ass to him. 

I respond with the lines of how am I and he explains saying things that I didn’t do in the game. He asks outside of the game why I’m a dick to him and I say because of one thing he did in the past. He took screenshots of a poem I sent to a girl and passed it around school making fun of me for it. Yeah, completely cringey, I get it but it still really hurt my feelings and messed up my chance with that girl. I explain this to him and he gets mad. AITA?"		1	0

bw1sbd	2019-06-02 20:21:28	EntireDistribution	AITA for not apologizing ?	"This story happened about a year ago, but I'm still thinking about it. So picture me after a long day of work taking the elevator to exit the building. For some reasons there was an issue with the usual exit way and we had to take a secondary exit. I was walking behind a lady probably in her 30's and kinda following her since I was pretty new to the workplace and never had to take this particular exit. Don't ask me why, but there was one of those retractable queuing barriers we had to go through in order to reach the exit door, and since she was ahead, the lady detached the barrier and I guess was about to hand it to me so that I can reattached it. But since I was already about to doze off, I did not pay attention and was already walking pass by. A few seconds later, the lady caught up to me, and suddenly **yelled** ""HEY, I'M NOT YOUR FUCKI\*\*\* DOORMAN!!"". I was pretty in shocked, so I just kept walking while looking at her as she walked beside me. She then yelled one more time and just stormed off. 

I don't deny being in the wrong here, although in my defense I would have thought that there was no need to reattach it since other people were going to have to go through it too. Back then I kinda felt guilty for not reacting quick enough and apologize, but now that I think about it I don't think I should apologize to someone whose first instinct is to yell at me.

I told him I was studying, he knows I’ve got exams, I’d already spoken to him this morning, and he wants to chat like 4-5-6 times a day. If I end the conversation he’ll just message again in 20 minutes and if I don’t reply he’ll message on a different social media platform.

bw1s12	2019-06-02 20:20:45	poldridge	AITA for avoiding my step mom?	"Hey team. I'm 36. She's been married to my dad for 25 years. Recently my dad (for some stupid reason) told me they had revisited their wills. She had one son prior to marrying my father,  and I have one brother.  For those of you into math,  that's 3 children between them but they never had a child together. Step mom convinced my father that her son should get half their assets when they die and my brother and I should split the other half. 

She used the flimsy arguement that when her son was younger,  her parents would give each of their grand children $50. Because she only had one son,  that was $50 into her household, whereas her siblings had more kid and hence they would get more money.  This left her with a different understanding of what equitable distribution looked like (pretty stupid,  in my opinion since the money was for the kid,  not her or her siblings).

Anyhow,  it's just money... but it doesn't feel particularly good.  AITA for avoiding her as much as possible and being somewhat cold in person? I don't know if I can have the conversation with her,  and this feels like all I can/ want to muster."	Not the A-hole	0	0

It started around 6 months ago, my best friend at the time came to school (senior in HS) and he was oddly quiet, I didn't make any remarks but I messaged him after school asking if he was fine. He said that he needed to be more mature and could not let himself act like he has been acting. To be fair it sounded totally reasonable because we would do many stupid things and he was almost 19 years old. Honestly I thought he would stop soon but he never did, the first few weeks were like usual but very uncomfortable for me. He literally avoided talking, when I said hi, he would make a weird humming sound. When I told him I got new shoes he just moved his head and made some strange noise again. Everything went down when I was talking with a friend about the subject and he told me that he was still talking to him (which now I doubt was not real), going to be honest with you here, I was very angry at him because I thought he just stopped talking to me to ""mature up"" when I was literally his only friend, I always stood up for him when people tried to bully him because he was socially awkward. Now I was angry at him because I thought he threw me away just to be more mature, the worst part is that believe it or not I was very mature for my age all the time.
Anyways I stopped talking to him, stopped sitting next to him. I occasionally talked shit about him but not too much, probably 2-3 times, just being honest. I watched others make fun of him, I didn't enjoy when they did but didn't feel bad either. One day (2-3 months after this) I decided to ask him for tissues, I was right behind him and called his name at least 10 times when he finally decided to answer. That's when it hit me that our friend ship ended

This event has been bothering me for too long, he was my best friend for 5 years and everything changed in one night, we haven't talked since. It's sad to think that we won't even say goodbye.

I  think it’s disturbing that my sister-in-law, who has a long-distance, limited relationship with our children, had their names tattooed on her arm. She did not ask us how we felt, just posted a picture on social media once it was done.
She has no children of her own, but is still in her child-bearing years. She is not a close beloved aunt of my children- they see her once a year and talk to her briefly on holidays. They never talk about her or ask about her between those times. They like her well enough, but she likes to lecture them and attempt to parent them, so a little of her goes a long way. 

She is going to expect us to all oooh and ahh about this tattoo. I have nothing nice to say. I am not flattered, I feel violated. I feel like it glorifies tattoos (something neither I or their father have, though this isn’t about tattoos in general-it’s about tattoos of my kids’ names. To each their own on tattoos). More importantly, it glorifies her relationship with our kids. She barely knows them, and doesn’t spend time with them when we do visit. On our last visit, she sent our kids to McDonalds with her friend and didn’t join them. She later used a photo the friend took of my sons eating, and posted it as if she HAD been there. It’s crazy. Instead of the cost of a tattoo (this tattoo is huge BTW), how about a plane ticket to visit the children you claim to love so much? She talks about my children taking care of her when she’s in a nursing home... why would they? They will be busy with their own families, and taking care of their parents!

I was so mad when I saw the tattoo that I told my husband I wanted to cancel our upcoming vacation to see her (and their grandparents). I have been taking my anger out on him, which is probably unfair but I feel his lack of communication with them leads to this kind of crazy. AITA because I think tattooing my kids’ names on her body is weird? Am I supposed to feel flattered?

I enjoy rock climbing and I met this pretty cool chick in one of my climbing groups. At first I thought she was just a another stuck up girl only there for her Insta, you know the type. She's really pretty, hot tight body the whole 9 yards. I thought she was a bitch because she never speaks to anyone but I decided to over look that, be the bigger person and speak to her. She's actually a sweet girl and she doesn't even have an Insta. She actually has no Social Media, oof. Trust me I  looked.

Anyway we start chatting and after she can no longer resist my charm she agrees to dinner. I invite her to seafood restaurant because I heard her saying how much she enjoys grab cakes. We were supposed to meet up at 7:30 I get there a bit early. Around 7:15 she shoots me a text that she is going to be about 10 minutes late due to a traffic accident (not a lie, I checked when I got home), i respond ok.

This is where I may have been the asshole. When the waiter stops by I decide to order her the crab cakes she loves so much. I even have the waiter pair it with a pricey glass of wine. She come in a few minutes later now 15 minutes late and sits down. We make small talk the waiter brings my drink,  the bottle to poor her glass of wine,and then leaves. I told her i ordered the wine for her and  she thanks me.  Next she mentions that maybe the waiter forgot to bring the menus. 

I say 'no i already ordered the crab cakes for you'. She replies 'um, why would you do that?'. Me 'because you were running late and I know you like them'. Her ' i don't know what to say I would have preferred to look at the menu and choose my own meal'. Me ' well the food should be out soon I'm sure you'll enjoy it plus I'm paying for it'. She tells me she was planning to pay for her half I jokingly to lighten the mood say 'well you still can'.

She chugs her class of wine throws a ten on the table and says "" I'm sorry I don't want to do this any more'. I tell her the wine was more then 10 bucks. She snatches the ten up puts it in her pocket and stomps out. She said something to the waiter on her way out but he wouldn't tell me.

That's the gist of it obviously more was said but you get the point.  And she blocked me. AITA?"		1	0
bw1i7d	2019-06-02 19:56:28	edu1797	WIBTA If I quit my nannying job 2 weeks before I'm supposed to start?	"So first some background: I'm a recent college grad and I have a job lined up that I'm super pumped about. It's at my dream company and I worked really hard to get it. The only downside is that my start date isn't until November. So, I decided to move back in with my parents for the summer and nanny to save up some money for when I move. I am also studying for and taking the law school admissions test in July. Although I was initially pretty down about starting so late (almost all of my friends are moving/starting their jobs in June/July) I tried to spin this as a positive since I will be saving money and have time to study for my test before I start work. 

&#x200B;

I was really lucky and quickly found a wonderful family to nanny for. I am supposed to be watching their kids Monday-Friday from 9:00-4:00, although there are some weeks that I have off (such as the week of 4th of July) and some weeks where I have longer days (8:00-6:00). I have already babysat for the kids a few times and we get along really well; the parents keep telling me how excited they are for me to start nannying full time. I am scheduled to nanny for them from mid-June until the last week of August. 

&#x200B;

Last week, I had a phone call with one of the pretty senior guys at my company. The phone call was prefaced as him simply wanting to catch up and hear how my studying was going and to offer some advice, since he attended law school. We spoke for a bit and then towards the end of the phone call he told me that they had had a change in their budget and would be able to have me start at the end of July, after I take my test. Although I was so excited at the thought of starting earlier, I felt guilty because I've committed to nannying for this family. I asked him if I could have some time to think about it and he said that was fine.

&#x200B;

Now I'm feeling super conflicted. On one hand, I know that I will be so much happier if I am able to move and start my job, and really my adult life, earlier. Not to mention, I would be making a lot more in my new position than I will be nannying. However, I also feel incredibly guilty abandoning this family right before the summer starts. My sister suggested offering to nanny for them until the date of my test (mid-July) so that they will have some time to find someone new, however I still worry that they're going to be really angry and hate me. I need to let both them and my company know soon, but I just can't decide. So WIBTA if I chose to accept the earlier start date and quit on this family I'm supposed to nanny for?

EDIT: I meant my sister suggest that I nanny until my test, not that she would nanny."	No A-holes here	0	0
bw1hmg	2019-06-02 19:54:57	AcidBear99	AITA for trying to fix my friend's car after crashing it?	 So a couple of months ago I crashed my friend's car (01 Impreza) while at delivering pizzas and promised that I would help fix it even though I have very little money. Thinking that I would pay for parts and his dad with 30+ years of experience in auto body repair would help make it look nice. I have been buying parts here and there and trying to get him to tell me what he wants it to look like when it's done. However, he is a bit of a depressed person and is slow to get things done. So when he recently started saying that he wants to make the car look nice again and ask his dad with the bodywork I was happy and wanted to get the parts he was talking about getting. So I took to the internet and bought the headlights that whereas close to stock as you can get for $150 about 80% of the free money I had. When I told him about the headlights and showed them on the internet he freaked out. He was saying that they were not the even for the same model of car (They were for his car look for hours just for this pair.) and hated on the fact that they were a slightly different color than stock which was $300 per side.

bw1haa	2019-06-02 19:54:09	ZachariasWexley	WIBTA if I told my mother that my dad is seeing prostitutes/escorts?	"Ok.

&#x200B;

I'll keep this brief as I can. I'm very morally conflicted. 

&#x200B;

Context: normal happy stable middle class family. Literally 0 major conflict, my parents have been married 25 years. Father has always been distant from mother, but she's incredibly faithful, loyal and they've made it work. 

&#x200B;

About a year ago I noticed my dad was always using whatsapp with a big smile on his face. This was strange as he's a workaholic, with no hobbies or many friends. I started to pay more attention - he was getting weird texts with lots of heart emoji's in etc. The more I payed attention the more it became obvious that he's seeing and having sex with various women around the world (he travels a lot). In addition, I know that he gives money to some of them. I have confirmed that he is having sex with them, as I saw him looking at an STD report, showing that this particular escort was clean.  

&#x200B;

He does not know that I know. I asked my brother, and he has known for four years. He said he found a library full of vagina pictures on his phone by accident. Both of us are kinda stunned into silence. We have NO idea if our mother knows. If my brother found out four years ago, then it's probably being going on for much, much longer. 

&#x200B;

We have not said anything out of fear of splitting up our ""perfect"" family dynamic. My father has created incredible opportunities for us and has never failed us. This is the ONLY bad thing he's ever done, and we could very much ruin his life by sharing this information with anyone. 

&#x200B;

I considered confronting him, but I have no idea how he will react. He could resent me forever. However my mother is extremely loyal, and I can't help but feel like if she finds out (assuming she doesn't know), the results could be absolutely catastrophic... 

&#x200B;

My mother talks a lot about looking forward to my father retiring so that he will spend more time with her. But little does she know he will never stop working, because then he wont be able to see these escorts, or hide that life easily. The only time he ever smiles is when texting them or talking to them on the phone. 

&#x200B;

Despite the results  being potentially atomic. WIBTA if I spill the beans to my mother!? I feel so guilty keeping quiet."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My husband and I use to go out together every other week or so, then we had a baby. So I have to stay home a lot of the time. It's been forever since I went out. Without having to worry about kids, diapers, appointments, etc. I know I was to expect this and I have no issues caring for my kids. I love them to the end and back. 

My husband works and I stay home. My daughter isn't old enough to go to school and Nannies and day-care are too expensive. Anyways, I get a bit upset when my husband goes hang out. He never has to stay home while I go out. I don't mind him blowing off steam and having a cold one with the boys, but it's starting to bother me that I never have a day for me. 

I want to know if I will be an asshole if I tell him he can't hangout until I get a day for me or until we figure out a schedule so I can have some time for myself. I'm not saying ban him completely from hanging out but Ive told him I'm starting to burn out, and I feel emotionally/mentally exhausted and stressed. 

What can or should I do?? WIBTA? 

TL;DR will I be an asshole if I told him, he can't hang out until I get a day for me as well? Because I never go out because of the kids and he gets to no matter what."	Not the A-hole	0	0

So, my condo has a room that can be rented out for events. It appears there’s some sort of baby shower or birthday going on there today, and there’s a lobby that spills out from this room.

I was waiting for someone in the lobby, and then suddenly this older woman and this younger woman comes out into the lobby. The younger woman had a little kid with her, and I didn’t think much of it at first, just the fact that maybe she wanted some quiet space in the lobby... but nope. Let me preface this: there is a bathroom down the hall WITH A CHANGING TABLE IN IT. 

Instead, she proceeded to start to change her baby’s diaper right in front of me. I did raise my voice and told her “That’s disgusting. Why are you changing your baby’s diaper here? There’s a bathroom down the hall with a changing table.” 

Both women just laughed in my face and started speaking to each other in Spanish, shit talking me because I guess because of my race they (incorrectly) assumes I couldn’t understand them. The woman just continued changing the baby’s diaper.

I took pictures of them when they were finishing up, but now I’m thinking of reporting them to my condo board, AITA?

Maybe I should have been more polite but I just assumed they’d use the bathroom / know better than to change their baby’s diaper in public."		1	0

       Recently my dad found out that mom’s been talking to her ex ‘boyfriend’ she dated when she was 14 for hours at a time over the phone. When my dad confronted my mom about this she immediately tried making a new telus account but it never ended up happening. Last week she also told my sister she was ‘going out’ and left my sister home alone for hours while me and my dad were at work, turns out my mom ran away for 3 days to another city without telling anyone to take some time to herself. 

      Last night my parents were downstairs arguing about something and i went down to grab my laundry and she laughed at my dads attempt to work things out. (she also mocked him about him quitting drinking and said “woo hoo you quit drinking for 4 days good for you, your sobriety medals are in the mail”) When i heard my mom laugh and mock my dad like that i told her she needed to grow the fuck up and quit living in whatever fantasy she’s in and to be with her own kids and quit trying to be with this guy and his kids. I also told said ‘I guess your own kids weren’t enough so go be a step mom now’ which i’ll admit was a bit out of line. after i said those things to my mom she stormed out the house and texted me saying how disrespectful i was. she got back this morning and i haven’t seen her since cause i’m on a 9 hour shift.

bw1d4t	2019-06-02 19:43:50	throwawaythecake247	WIBTA for asking my friend to cut contact with my abusive ex?	"I’ve been grappling with this for a while now because as a principle I do not believe that I should get to tell other people how to live their lives. Therefore I shouldn’t be able to tell my friends who they are and aren’t allowed to be friends with. But due to the circumstances I feel that this situation could potentially be an exception. So, I am looking to the Reddit community to help me out.

For some minor backstory - last spring I started talking to this guy I was sort of friends with. We would communicate for hours each day on various social media platforms. My friend bore witness to this and was someone I would occasionally go to for advice. She had some minor conversations with this guy and thought he seemed nice. She was supportive of our relationship.

I broke up with the guy a few months later. The honeymoon stage ended quick and the relationship at its end was extremely turbulent as I started to see through the facade and realize how abusive he truly was. After an explosive fight that was a culmination of months of unhappiness we broke up. Over the course of the relationship my friend and the guy were amicable towards each other and considered each other friends. They never hung out without me and only really talked when there was a concern about myself - for example, my friend once sent him messages threatening him if he were to ever harm me.

My friend wanted to remain neutral in the aftermath of the breakup, since to her it was the dissolution of a relationship between two of her “friends”. This was kind of a snub to me initially as I was one of her closest friends meanwhile she and him were more-so acquaintances. I was kind of angry at the fact that she did a complete 180 from that initial phase of threatening him if he ever hurt me, but obviously I can’t expect her to attack him. At the very least I expect her to be supportive of me and undeniably take my side. It was not an amicable breakup.

Recently I’ve come to learn that she still communicates with my ex and will talk of him in a pleasant manner. This is all coming to fruition because she brought up out of nowhere how he got something he really wanted and that she expressed congratulations. She claims that she is only nice to him because he did a favor for her but given how horrid he was to me I don’t understand how she could even consider being nice to this person at all. Why would you keep ties to someone who mistreated one of your close friends? 

Am I justified in saying that I want her to delete all ties to my ex? It doesn’t sit too well with me because it seems a bit domineering. I’m loyal to my friends and if the tables were turned I would’ve wanted her ex crucified. Am I the asshole for expecting at least a watered down version of that?"		0	0

"I'm 18/F, my grandma is practically my mom because she took guardianship over me as a small child when my own mother was going off the rails with drug addiction. But legally I am my grandparents ""child"" instead of grandchild. 

She is not the same as she once was though, her mind is starting to go a little. She can still function, she's in her early 70's and still has to work. I feel bad that she has to work all the time, but I also feel she's responsible for her life. 

But as a now legal adult, I am trying to grow up. I am trying to do things I've never done before, and enjoy what little of a life I currently have. Last year I dropped out of highschool and got my GED, so before I got my first job I spent six months in the house, every single day doing nothing with only my grandparents to keep me any real company. It was lonely, because they don't treat me like my own age. I'm still a baby to them, and I think I always will be. But it gets demeaning after awhile. Like, really. 

The thing is, my grandpa and grandma absolutely hate each other, and now that I'm starting to live my own life my grandpa is beginning to hate me and will constantly compare me to my grandma, and my mom. I often feel rotten and tense around the two of them because I know later I will hear it from him. I can't do anything without him trying to talk me out of things, or talking to me in a condescending tone and giving me lectures on how to correctly do things. He's a horrid person. 

But he's irrelevant, I'm only mentioning him to give some context. 

I've also been working a ton lately, I work at a fast food place and my last paycheck I clocked in at 60hrs. I usually work afternoons and nights. But when I get home, all I want is some down time to relax and play video games. Alone. 

My grandma will sometimes walk into my room at 1 in the morning because I had my light on, ""To make sure I am ok."" 

She watches a lot of crime television, and has come to the belief that me working nights is dangerous and not at all safe. She worries CONSTANTLY about me, and I'm so tired of it. I just want to be treated like an adult. I don't enjoy her company as much anymore because we are so different and have very different beliefs. She doesn't approve or even want to be apart of my interests. We never go anywhere or do anything outside of the house because my grandpa is cheap and he doesn't feel like it. She will asks me what I'm doing on the computer, when I try to explain she doesn't understand, when she does understand she doesn't like it and would rather do stuff with me that she enjoys. She's always making negative comments about herself, and using me as a way to deal with her problems. I'm just really tired of it. Work feels like a more supportive and positive place than home. I treat her unreasonably at times because I get so annoyed, telling her to please leave me alone or to go away. But I feel like I have no space, and no privacy really.

"About 9 months ago I adopted a dog, she's a big mastiff pit mix and loves everyone. Though she's a big sweetheart, you have to be pretty strict with her regarding rules. If you don't she will not follow anything you say. I moved home about 2 weeks ago from college and suddenly behavior issues she hasn't had since I got her are showing up, (chewing, going after food, jumping). I've talked to my parents about my rules for her but they never follow what I say. They also complain about my dog acting up, even though I've explained why its happening. They have never dealt with a dog her size before, and any of the previous dogs we've had in the past have been dangerous or untrained. I have worked really hard to get my dog to were she is and I would like for the training to stay. I'm going on a vacation in 2 weeks and they are watching her, which I am really grateful for but I'm worried I'll come back and my dog will be completely out of control.

I was thinking I would write a list of rules and sit down and talk my parents through them. They aren't the strictest rules, things like ""do not make a big deal out of coming home or leaving and only let her out every 3 hours.""

bw1b51	2019-06-02 19:38:50	h1029384756	WIBTA for reporting someone copying me in an exam and potentially getting them disqualified	"Before you instantly NTA because cheating is wrong, read the whole post.

Short background: it's exam season and someone has copied me in one of the maths exams. I know this because they stated before the exam that since they were sitting next to me they intended to copy from me, and after the exam they the  informed others of how they copied from me.

This person isn't a mean or bad person, they're perfectly kind and pleasant, they're just not very good at maths. They are in jeopardy of failing the subject, and if they do they will have to continue re-taking it until they are 18 or they pass it, so they have taken the decision to copy my answers in an attempt to pass.

I haven't yet reported them because I don't know whether I should. I'm aware that cheating is obviously wrong and they don't deserve to pass by copying someone else, however....

If I report them to the exam staff and they notice the person attempting to copy from me in the next maths exam (bearing in mind it's not guaranteed they'll be caught if I report them), they will almost certainly be disqualified from the exam and fail the subject, screwing over (or at least making very painful) their next few years of life since they'll need to retake and wait a whole year to do so.

Also, if they are disqualified from the subject, they could also potentially be disqualified from several (and possibly all) of their other subjects, meaning they'll leave school with no qualifications due to this one incident. This depends on how severely the incident is viewed by the exam providers. In worst case they could be banned from taking future exams for a number of years, although this is unlikely.

So, WIBTA for reporting someone who has cheated, if it means getting them disqualified from getting their maths qualification and potentially all others, svrewing up the next few years of their life, for one stupid mistake they're making as a teenager?

EDIT: some people have raised the concern around me potentially getting in trouble for enabling them to cheat if I don't report them, bit due to how these exams are taken nationally and not marked by our schools own teachers, cheating doesn't get detected at the marking level, the only time is really when the exam is taking place. basically, me getting in trouble isn't a concern."

bw1awu	2019-06-02 19:38:15	fogminded	AITA for being pissed because I was not invited?	"I've (19M) known this guy since I was 7, and ever since I can remember, he's tough to get along w/. Let's call him P. He has an explosive behavior, tends to make up stuff about other people, has an ego the size of the moon. I've always gotten along with him, though, as I tend to always fall into a group in which he's in and I'd much rather avoid conflict for the health of the group. In reality, he's in a lot of different groups. To be fair to him, he can be fun, if he doesn't find anything to pick you on.

Like most people in existence, had a terrible senior year. Career pressure, grades, serious friendship shake-ups, you name it. I then befriend B, who'd once been in my class when I was also around 7, and was seriously good friends with P. We saw things in common with each other at the time, so our friendship clicked. It was very much an all-guys group, where we'd go to each other's homes, get hella drunk, video games, etc. Didn't seem like much else at the time, as I thought that particular circle was being created then and there. I was wrong.

As time passed, started to notice how they treated this friends group more like a club than just a chill hang out thing. They'd joke about how they'd ""initiate me"", how they can all trust each other and all that. Some could say it's typical dude stuff, but it's really not my thing. It suggests that any other group of friends I have would be a second in comparison, even ones that I'd been part of for a long time. Also didn't want to be ""initiated"" into anything, since I was already friends with them for some time already, but to them, only now would I be some ""pupil"". I thought I was like anybody else?

Well then, what were ""dark jokes"" before started becoming commonplace commentary, like being openly homophobic and incredibly mysoginistic, all-around toxic environment. To make matters worse, B dated my sister for a while a few months prior, so if they were taking liberties abt other girls, let alone my sister (who didn't part ways with him in very good terms).

Now P? He's the one who pisses me off the most, because of all of them, he's the one who enforces this ""brotherhood"" and takes it seriously the most. He'd mention it with different groups, throw out weird inside jokes and overall remind everyone that I was part of it. I HATED that. Plus he's the biggest hypocrite I ever met, talking shit about people behind their backs, lying to be accepted in lgbt+ groups then being a bigot, goes on. To compensate I began to ""jokingly"" mock brohood's stuff. P did not like it.

I stopped responding on the group chat. Stopped going to hangouts. Don't have much against them individually except for P. Today, I saw he removed me from the group chat. Fine. Then a mutual friend (F19) messages me abt a big party that's happening, which P is organizing. Surprise, not invited. Now *everyone* I know and like is going, except for me. Blood's boiling right now.

bw19zv	2019-06-02 19:35:58	MetaGigaZ	AITA for walking out on my mom during yard work?	"Yesterday, I had an epileptic seizure. It usually takes me a day to recover from one, but after that, I’m fine for work and such. Thing is, my mom wanted me to do yard work with her. Since my right shoulder dislocates during my seizures, there wasn’t much I could do. Plus, my brain was still a bit slow and fuzzy. So, I chose a task that currently required neither my full strength nor my brain. I mowed the lawn with our mower (you push down onto something and it’s like Soviet Russia: The mower pulls me) and left it at that.

I get back inside to take a nap, since this is supposed to be recovery day, when my mom calls me out. She tells me good job on the yard, and then tells me that I need to help her on the yard some more. She knows that I need to recover since I was the one that called her when I was coming out of it. So, I was about to pick up the bag of leaves leaning on the side of the house when I felt... Weird. Like, I could move, but I didn’t want to. When my mom noticed, she said a passive aggressive remark similar to something like, “Be sure to take your time so you don’t hurt yourself on that back.” I decide to try, but because the bag was months old and it had rained a few days ago, the bag tore open. My mom looked at me expectantly, but I honestly couldn’t. Dislocating your arm mixed in with having your brain feel half dead would take longer than if she helped out. My mom just sighed, gripped the bag... Then it tore, leaving a cylinder of leaves. Fortunately, it wasn’t too hard to put it in the wheelbarrow and we managed to put another bag of leaves on top.

And so, I was sent off to dump the contents. As I went along, everything was five times harder than it should be. For some reason, it took me five minutes to take a wheelbarrow from one half of the yard to the other when it would usually take about two at most. So, I dump the contents at the destination, hobble back, and tell my mom how funny I feel. She instead tells me to suck it up. This instantly sent me over my breaking point, I tell her that the seizure yesterday has been making me feel strange, and I leave inside the house. A few minutes later while I was typing up this story, she comes in, sees me on the phone, then says, “Who paid for that?”

I turn off my phone and decide to sleep.

“Who pays for the ceiling fan blowing in your face?”

I also don't like pictures of me being sent to people I've never met on Snapchat by my friends, it makes me uncomfortable as well and they know it too. 

Am I being an asshole for being pissed that they're more into taking selfies/group selfies, editing themselves thoroughly, and then posting these images to their 1000+ follower social media(95% of whom are people I don't even KNOW) when we hang out instead of putting their cameras away and actually enjoying the moment and the people they're being with?? Plus the fact that they know I'm extremely camera-averse yet they get mad at me when I see them whip out their front camera and I gesture to them that I don't want to be in the picture. My friends' reasoning for this is that they must ""capture the moment"" so they don't forget, but aren't they completely losing the moment by being glued to their photo editing apps the whole time we're out together? Like if we go out to eat, they'd wait for good lighting and then take a selfie and then spend the rest of the meal editing it and not even talking. Lately it's been feeling more like they need a social media flex or simply fodder for their Instagrams rather than just wanting a group picture to keep for the memories, and I'm not feeling so good about my camera-induced anxiety being weighed less than my friends' need to post on social media..."

Well a couple of weeks turns into a couple of months, and now Tom told us his friend, Bill, is going to stay for another 3 months. 

Bill isn't a terrible guy, but he does do some minor things that annoy me that I didnt feel i should bring up since he was supposed to be gone in a couple of weeks. Things like take up all the space in the fridge and freezer with his food, using some specific kitchen items of mine even though I dont want anyone else to use them and the other roommates know, and the biggest issue is smoking pot in my porch even though the complex specifically made it clear in the lease that absolutely no smoking of any kind is allowed in our building. I texted Tom 3 days ago that I was wondering if his friend Bill was looking for a place, got a job...etc to dependent from all of us. I understand, finding a place and a job is hard and annoying, but he said he isn't doing anything at the moment. 

Today Tom texted me and told me that Bill will be staying with us for another 3 months. He said that he averaged out some of our living expenses and will be paying us (3 other roommates) $10 a month as Bill will be paying him to stat in his room. He ended the message by saying that he doesn't see why this couldnt work as Bill hasn't done anything ""wrong"" and that in essence Bill will just be another roommate.

I dont know what my other two roommates think about this but is absolutely unacceptable in my eyes. There isn't any contract, renter's insurance, or records that Bill lives here and if anything happens I could be liable for any damages...etc.

Before going to a store to buy the food, they asked if I wanted to join them. I was kind of wary about the whole ordeal but agreed to come with and we headed for the store. 

I suggested to not purchase any bread since I heard it wasn't very nutritional for ducks; instead, I recommended to go for frozen peas or cracked corn. As we walked through a snack isle though, she grabbed a bag of Nature Valley Honey Oats (not the granola bars, just the broken up chunks of oats if I recall.) I'm not an expert on duck-feeding or anything, but something didn't really sit right with me feeding ducks ""Honey Oats."" 

I advise her to not to purchase it, but she retorts to me about how it was fine and to ""stop trying to ruin the fun"" for my younger sibs. She then goes to tell me how she read online that oats are good for ducks, in which I tell her these particular ones may not be the best/nutritional for them. This argument goes on, and basically I tell her about how we really should not be feeding the ducks let alone wildlife at all. 

In short, she gets mad and makes all of us leave the store. Youngest sibling starts to cry and asks her why we're leaving, and she says to blame me. We get home, and my dad asks why we're back so early. My sister points to me and proceeds to mock me about my argument, and then they both tell me how I'm being too serious about the whole thing when its just feeding some ducks.

bw12go	2019-06-02 19:17:28		AITA for asking my friend to pay rent even though he is not moving in?	"Hi,

so I have an apartment in Paris and am leaving town for three months. For that time I asked friends if they wanted to rent my room. Six weeks before I reached out to people and I found three people who were interested. One for the whole period and two for half each. I talked to them all and gave the apartment to the one person who wanted it for the whole time, easier for everybody. 

Now a week before my friend is supposed to move in he texts me that he won't be able to make our handover meeting because he got a migraine and won't be able to make it, maybe not even the move in date on Sunday (which is the date I leave). I said that's okay and instead sat down and wrote an apartment guide for him, explaining the heater etc. four pages total. 

Three days before however I re-read the message and quickly ask ""just to make sure, when you say you might not be able to move on Sunday, you mean you want more time before the exhausting act of moving, but are not cancelling the whole idea of renting my place on me, right?"" And I get back that now yes he actually does not want the apartment anymore and will go to his parents. 

Problem is he says that then he won't pay me anything. No money at all, no discussion. I told him it's not fair to cancel three days before and also said I'm happy to help him find a replacement (actually the two other people still needed a place for a bit of the time, so I was able to quickly cover 2/3 of the cost), but I do expect him to pay at least the last 1/3 of the rent. 

He has no costs connected to being sick (we're in Europe, healthcare is free), he has the money for the apartment apparently as now instead he's going to his parents to recover, and cancelling three days before, especially on a friend is a dick move. But he clearly portrays it that I am absolutely out of line for even asking a poor person that is sick to still pay.

bw108w	2019-06-02 19:11:59	MarkissC_	AITA for asking a female friend of mine to pay for my movie ticket?	"So a month or so ago my female friend asked what I was doing on a Friday. I said I was working some and had a few client meetings late. I ask her why she asked. She goes”Never mind, your busy...” She always likes to assume that because I do things during the day I am automatically not able to do anything else. Which is fucking annoying because you could ask instead of playing this stupid game where I invite myself for you.

I knew she wanted to see if I was free at night to see the new Avengers Endgame movie. So i ask her, did you want to see that new Avenger movie to which she was like yeah. I couldn’t do that day so we postponed to Saturday.

This is where the dilemma starts and to give you some context, this female friend of mine has had a crush on me in high school but we still kick it and kind of half date because tbh, she has some good qualities about her. And my parents like her, so yeah we go out sometimes. Whenever we go out, I pay for everything. And I do this for every girl I’m with friend or not I just pay when I’m out with women. And every single time we’ve gone out in the past I have paid for everything. That is a fact.

So heres the dilemma, I just copied the text convo verbatim you guys be the judge:

[Her]
Is 5:30 pm Saturday good?

[u/MarkissC_]
Why so early?

Okay then uh, 8:30?
Is that cool?

Yeah
Get tickets in advance
We going to bay st. right?

Uuummm I think I’ll just wait for the ticket
Yes Bay Street

They get reserved quick

Okay
Ill see where I can get my ticket

You not getting mine too?

I wasn’t planning on it???? 
Aye when’s your birthday? 

All the lunches Ive gotten you
Ok

What do you mean?? I don’t understand trynna tell me? 

I never make you pay for stuff when we go out so i figured you were at least going to offer to get  my ticket.

u/MarkissC_, if you can’t tell me that we need to go Dutch then we are good. I didn’t realize it was tit-for-tat with you
Wow

What?

Figure it out 

Whyd you say wow
And lol i wasnt gonna make you pay anyway but itd be easier if you got them since your organizing everything

Do you hear yourself??? Just because someone plans something doesn’t mean they’re obligated to pay. Friends plan things all the time but I’m not like “oh so you put this together so you need to pay”. No I’m perfectly good paying for myself. I don’t ask you for anything, so I don’t understand why you are saying “all the lunches I got you”.. every time I want to pay for myself you push me back and say “nah, don’t even trip, I got it” 

I mean... its a nice gesture tho

Wow

You be trippen lol

I don’t understand why you are laughing because I clearly am not 
Be better

Be better??😂😂
You really not gonna get my ticket tho ill venmo u

If you don’t understand what I am saying then its whatever 
Everything is not a joke.

Its just the movies thoo...

[End of text convo]

I ended up buying both tickets anyway and having an awkward ass experience. But AITA for asking her to pay for my movie ticket?

Edit: for context, The reason I wanted her to pay was because if one person buys both tickets, the seats will be next to each-other. But if you do it separately they might not be. Since she was the one who asked in the first place I figured she’d just buy them. It wasn’t because Iv bought stuff for her in the past.

bw0xej	2019-06-02 19:05:06		AITA - Bartender/Cocktail Waitress Drama	"I am a girl in my young 20s (cocktail waitress) working with a man in his 50s (as a bartender) in a casino.

I have been called in a couple times to see my boss. The first happened after the bartender I work with reported me . The policy at my work is to only allow individual customers to have drinks in a 20 minute interval. I am fine with this and try to follow it to the best of my ability.

When this incident occurred a group of men came up to the craps table which I was serving. I brought them four drinks and when another group of men came up they requested the same drinks .

    After, bartender reported me for overserving. Although I wasn't serving the same men again but rather a different group of customers I was still reported.

After this I was turned in again. My manager told me that the bartender reported me for smelling bad. I was confused as coworkers & customers had told me I smell good (I shower regularly, apply scented body lotion, deodorant, and perfume). I was confused and humiliated.

I was then reported for talking too much to the casino dealers. I admit that I spoke to them too much. I work graveyard and there are many times where there is no customers, I have done my cleaning, and have no more duties to complete. Despite this, I recognize that it does not excuse my actions.

I have a manager who I'm close with. I was venting to him about being turned in. I know this was a bad choice on my part admittedly. The bartender overheard our conversation. He pulled me over after my shift.

He asked me whether I thought that I didn't deserve to be brought in to the boss each time. I told him that I genuinely tried my best and that while I accepted my mistakes, and I was a bit confused by everything. He then told me that “I was the coworker that had brought him the most embarrassment out of everyone he had worked with in 20 years”.

Additionally, I must note that he consistently would take small passive aggressive jabs at me, and make me feel stupid in a myriad of ways verbally.

After all this he then told me that I was not exactly a model employee and that my actions warranted what happened to me. He questioned me about my absences and told me that, as per the boss, he recorded everything I did in my shift down to when I went to the bathroom.

On a side note, I have a very bad anxiety disorder and when I have panic attacks I vomit. Sometimes I call in sick due to these, but in an attempt to be a good employee I oftentimes have my panic attacks in the bathroom, vomit, clean myself up and go about my day.

After this, I felt humiliated and put down I cried and felt humiliated.

I am not the best employee. I am too chatty. I make mistakes. But I have satisfied customers and met the expectations for them in very way that I can. My loved ones are advising me to report the bartender I work with to HR. I am scared of losing a great source of income while I am pursuing my education.AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bw0wbd	2019-06-02 19:02:27	ellieefry	WIBTA if I warned my former sorority siblings about some people in my sorority?	"Sorry if the title is confusing, but it will make more sense once I get into the details. 

So the tea is that I used to be in a sorority. I ended up getting sick a lot this quarter, so I ended up having to miss a bunch of business meetings. I also skipped my retreat because it was in the middle of midterm season. My sorority has also been having general issues with attendance and people paying their dues as well. 

I have a feeling that since the attendance issue was so bad, they were desperate to find someone to blame their problems on. my sorority siblings accused me of not being dedicated enough to the sorority, even though I was up to date on all my dues  and tried to contribute when I could. They also blamed me for a social getting canceled, even though more than half flaked and I was at my best friend’s birthday party. They even blamed me for ruining their reputation within a Greek council because I allegedly was skipping meetings for a position I wasn’t actually in and only subbing for every once in a while. One of them even said that they would not care for any explanation I could give about my commitment. 

One of my other sibs tried to make a point that my attendance record was not much different from her own, but that ultimately didn’t stop the rest of my siblings from voting me out on one of my offices.

Two of my siblings, who are actually my friends, did not attend the meeting. I want to tell them about what happened to me, because I don’t want them to end up getting thrown under the bus one day. However, the problem is that some of the sibs that threw me under the bus are my friends’ bigs, and they have a very good relationship. I also don’t want to risk ruining their relationship. So, would I be the asshole if I told my friends to be wary of the other sibs, at the risk of creating friction in their relationships with their bigs?

TL;DR: my sorority siblings threw me under the bus and I’m wondering if I can tell my friends (whose bigs were among those who threw me under the bus) about what happened to make sure something like this doesn’t happen to them.

Note: I call my fellow sorority members “siblings” rather than “sisters” because it is an LGBTQ+ org and some members are non-binary."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My sister got engaged 2 years ago and her soon to be husband (let’s call him Tom) was an extremely successful doctor who traveled the world aiding Africa and Asia with western medical practices. Anyway, never met the guy but once before their wedding. He didn’t have a facebook or any means of me being able to casually chat with him. Well about 2 months prior to the wedding I have my sister and her friends come stay at my beach house since I was not using it and she wanted a little get-away. 

One thing she doesn’t know is I have cameras in my living room, driveway, and backyard. So I casually check my living room camera Saturday midday to make sure everything was intact and running smoothly. The second I open the app to view the camera there my sister is, in a swinging sex chair, being banged by 2 guys. I was in utter disbelief she would not only disrespect my home in such a way, but ruin a marriage the whole family viewed as perfect. 

I monitor the cameras Sunday and she has ANOTHER guy (not one of the other 2) fucking in my god damn swimming pool. She lied about having a girls trip and now I have to drain my pool and sanitize my whole house.

I’ve decided enough is enough, so we have a big get together of both families (I play it cool with my sister I don’t want her to expect anything)

Dinner goes on and I try and get Tom alone so I can tell him. He refused so I just blurted across the table “Just thought I’d let you know your “soon to be wife” is a slut who gets gangbanged by strangers” and then tossed him a three and a half hour video of my sister getting fucked by strangers. Then promptly left the dinner.

I thought I was about to die for an instant. Our mom wanted me to reconnect with him. At first I was ok with it, but as soon as he texted me and asked me to call him the ptsd came back. I'm in alcohol recovery myself and one of the things this ptsd and stress causes is a desire to drink. The mental trauma from being around a violently psychotic person is hell.  


I told her I have to request privacy and to be left alone because I'm having these psychological effects from potentially having my brother back in my life. And it might seem now she is not talking to me, but too early to tell. I feel maybe there is some manipulation involved on her part. I can see myself after a while getting back in touch with him if he consistently follows his recovery regimen and stays off drugs. I don't have a lot of faith this will happen, but I hope it does sincerely. I feel like my own mental well being is number one priority. But she is possibly laying a guilt trip on me. What do I do?"

bw0tw1	2019-06-02 18:56:31	floydcouncilAK	AITA for getting upset at my wife for befriending a mysoginistic weed dealer	"I (46m) moved my wife (41f) and family across country to start over after my job failed and we lost our house. 
We have been married for 22 years (this Friday), have 5 children together (2 still under 18) and been together for 25 yrs. 
After plans fell through for employment here, I was able to get a steady job and work towards rebuilding and starting over. My wage is less than half of what I was earning previously and it became necessary for her to get a job, to make ends meet. She never had to work as I made enough, starting out, and then plenty further in to the relationship, until the work ran out, about 5 years ago and we had to relocate. 
She got a job at a gas station and met a dealer, through casual conversation, and befriended him. In the beginning, I didn’t mind but as their relationship took off, I was uncomfortable with her spending more and more time with this man. After a few weeks of this: going to his apt. after work several days a week and practically every weekend until 4-5 in the morning, I finally said “Hey. This is making me uncomfortable. Could you please stop”, she refused and started yelling at me about how she “just wants friends”. 
I understood this and have tried to come to terms with her desire for friendship, but I just cant get over this. 
Last night, she received a text around 1 am and woke me up out of a dead sleep to “ask” if she could go over there. I said “sure, whatever you want” and went back to bed. This morning, I woke up and was still in a shitty mood from last night’s ordeal. 
AITA for not honoring her desire to be friends with this person? 
I’ve seen how he treats his “girlfriends” and he has even disrespected her on a few occasions. 
It’s valid to note that I do not believe she is pursuing a sexual relationship with this person. 
The deeper details are far worse, in my opinion, but too long to note here."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My gf and i visited a friend who was basically dying. My gf's parents were present but we came in the room at different times. 


When we got in, we made our way to the back of the room to let the family have some space. My gf and i decided to wait until the family allowed us to say our goodbyes. I didn't want to interrupt so i didn't formally say hello to the relatives. Some time passed without us saying or doing anything.


 When the nurses came in, that's when things went wrong. They were doing their job, but my gf's mom was being nosy. She is a nurse so i guess she wanted to know what was happening. It got to a point where gf's mom was inputting her own opinions on how things should be. She wasn't being loud or anything, just trying to input herself in the situation. 


Everyone was visibly upset since gf's mom wasn't a close family friend. Fortunately, gf's dad was there to end it and they left after saying goodbye. Me and gf were still in the room waiting for our goodbyes. The nurses were talking to a relative, it was clear that they were mad at gf's mom. After a couple of minutes, one of the relatives came to us to tell us to say goodbye and leave. 



AITA for staying too long doing nothing, even when gf's parents left?


Edit: just wanted to add that the whole time we were there, we were just watching them mourn and it was pretty awkward since the family didn't know us well. 

Before we visited, i talked to my friend's little sister and basically acted like my friend was already dead, which my other friends thought was an asshole move. So the family might have also been mad because of that."	No A-holes here	0	0

"Yesterday, me (17 F) and my boyfriend (17 M) (we have been dating for a year) got very high in a park. I tried skateboarding on his skate and I fell and sprained my ankle. I didn't know what was happening, and for the first moments I thought I might have broken my ankle. Since I was high, I didn't know if the fact that weed is an anti-inflammatory made it hurt less than it should. I started panicking and it hurt a lot. My bf, instead of comforting me and asking if I was okay, started getting impatient. He just told me that I was exaggerating and that I should stop being a drama queen and rolled his eyes at me. I think he felt like I was ruining the mood. I understand that spraining an ankle is something pretty basic but it had never happened to me and we both didn't know what happened yet. I was hurt, clearly badtripping, very worried, and couldn't walk normally. He kept on acting impatient with me. 

Today, thinking back to it, I got very mad at him. I told him he couldn't keep on dating me if he was so egocentric and cared more about his fun than my well being. I am furious about it. He handled that confrontation very immaturely and we haven't talked since. My ankle still hurts, lol.

So the high school dance was coming up and I had this brilliant plan where I'd get a poster saying ""hey the dance is coming up, wanna go? If yes, check your bushes."" Funny thing is, that's it, there was nothing in the bushes. So I put it on his front door and drive away. Later I see his Facebook/Instagram and he has a group of people looking, turns out it was his birthday and I didn't know...

So this morning I was taking my usual morning poop when I hear a frantic knock on the bathroom door. My sister who has a myriad of issues including OCD really needed her tooth brush and couldn’t wait 2 minutes for me to leave the bathroom. She asked me how long I’d be and I said 5 minutes so then she said “ok well I’m coming in to get it right now”. I said please don’t I am pooping and it’s really weird but I hear her shuffling around in a drawer outside where we have a key to the locks for the upstairs rooms. She grabs it and proceeds to barge in and grab her toothbrush. I was fucking furious. After this I decided I would go into her room and move her exercise bike while she was out of the house. When I entered the room and moved the bike an actual inch from where she had it placed originally I realized it was a bit immature and too much work and decided not to. When she came home and went to her room she had a complete meltdown because it was moved at an angle and has been upset all day. I know OCD can be very hard to deal with in every day life but for the past few years I’ve been walking on eggshells around her cuz she’s got so many issues and the seriousness in my house has been very depressing. I kind of just wanted to mess with her though it was out of anger and now my mom is so disappointed in me saying she didn’t raise me to be like that. I really feel like this blew up for no reason.

bw0o8f	2019-06-02 18:41:53	advicewithoutdemand	WIBTA If I called my future SIL out for consistantly being selfish.	"So I'll try to make this as short as possible. My fiance and I have been together for nearly a year and a half and are set to marry in a month. Throughout the length of time I've known her family her sister has been disrespectful and selfish. Even before then she has the reputation of being manipulative, lieing, and snobby. She is spoiled by her parents more then her siblings because she is the last born and she is intelligent. 

To elaborate and provide some examples I'll list them below.

1. While at dinner one night with her family I talked about the history of my mom and dads divorce. I told of how bad it was for my mom to be in that relationship and while not happy they divorced could see the benefits for both of them emotionally as well as myself. This prompted her to say how divorce is stupid and there is no reason for it and how she would never get one. Like fuck did you not her about the part where my mom was depressed for 17 years.

2. Recently while she was graduating (very intelligent girl) I asked her while her family and I were at a bar if she was nervous for graduation. She procceed to show me a picture with all her medals and tassles and then not say another word to me. 

3. My fiance asked her at her college signing day in highschool if her hair looked good for a picture. She proceeded to tell her it didn't matter because she would not look better then her.

3. This is what sparked me to make this post. My fiance had planned to spend the night before the  wedding with her sister in her hotel room. That was all good until this week she suggest to stay at home with thier parents as she may sleep better. The mother asked her about this and it turns out she only said that so her boyfriend could stay in the hotel room with her, not because she cared about how my fiance would sleep. 

So WIBTA if I called her out on her bullshit and told her how badly she hurt her sister over a boy she has dated for 4 months and is currently living with, among other things she has said and done?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bw0nvw	2019-06-02 18:40:58	urtaa	WIBTA If I share a video I took of my ex?	"Ok so I don't even know where to begin...


Background: I dated my ex for a while in that time we were engaged. Long story short I ended up breaking up with him because he was an alcoholic. He has a daughter (this is what the issue is about)


Ok I was going through my phone recently and found I video I took about a year ago when we were still together. The video starts with what looks like me on the bed taking the video and him with his daughter in his hands. From the angle I can tell I was taking the video without him knowing. It's very clear that he was drunk. He's speaking to his daughter saying something to the tune of I never thought my daughter would kill me go ahead kill me. His daughter was 2 at the time. He's not yelling or anything, he seems like he was genuinely hurt. From what I could tell the issue was that his daughter had preferred to sleep with me over him. She starts crying and yells mama so I take her from him (I'm not her mom, but she had started calling me mama).

The video is like 20 mins long and all of this time he keeps repeating something of the sorts and I keep begging for him to just go to bed (it was 2:30 am, the video is time-stamped). He gets a call from one of his friends and tells me he's leaving and to take care of his daughter. I obviously don't want him to do this because he's drunk and it's 2:30 am and he's gotten in trouble before for driving drunk. He doesn't do much more than this besides some slight raising his voice and saying weird things to his daughter like the ones in the beginning. Anyway at the end he calls for her she goes and I'm able to convince him to just lay down with her because she clearly wants to sleep next to him, so he does. 

The issue I'm having is that I don't know if it's appropriate to share this video with the girl's mother. She and I became friends through my relationship with him. He sees his daughter regularly and I don't want that to change because of me. But I was there for many of those nights when we were together and this was something that happened regularly and I hope that it doesn't anymore, but I don't know. I know he hasn't stopped drinking, but maybe not as much as he did before.

"So I’m going to Europe soon with this girl I’m talking to and she’s basically my girlfriend (BUT SHES NOT) but I have not made anything official because of commitment issues I guess.

Some back history on me and my ex: We became an item for a couple of months but then decided to end things. Months later, we became friendly again and became closer. During that time she decided to move back to Europe without telling me and I haven’t seen her since. We have shared a lot of great memories and tears. It has been a year and a half.

So fast forwards to now, I’ve been talking to this girl for a couple of months and we decided to go to Europe, but I realized that if I am in Europe, I should at least try and see my ex, and I talked to her about and she seems excited for me to come. She would also be paying a lot of money to visit me while I’m there. They are both great girls, but I am unsure what my next move should be.

My main objective of this trip is to NOT see my ex but to visit as many countries as I can in a limited amount of time with my “girlfriend”. It just so happens that my ex has the chance to visit me during that time. I would like to see her, but it’s not the end of the world if I can’t. I am not asking for relationship or anything, just want to know if I am in the wrong.

bw0ndq	2019-06-02 18:39:42	EliCashPDX	AITA for not wanting a dog?	"Married to a lovely wife, with two kids in elementary school. We both work full time in demanding jobs and manage to keep the household running without a lot of outside help, as our families are all across the country. My wife has known from the beginning that I am a cat person, and don't really like or feel comfortable around dogs. We have talked in the past about having a dog, but in my mind that was more joking around (in the spirit of 'maybe someday we'll have goats or chickens') than making plans. We currently have two cats, one of which my wife sprung on me unexpectedly the night before an important presentation at a new job for which we had moved cross country. I love both of the cats and enjoy their presence in the house. 

I found out yesterday my wife had formed a 'secret plan' with the kids to begin planning to get a dog at the end of the summer. I strongly objected, and it's lead to a volatile argument. My stance is that we don't keep secrets from each other, and that if we were to get a dog, I will not lift a finger to take care of it or make it a financial priority, as we are still digging out of debt and I'm not looking for another source of expenses. 

When the topic has come up with my kids over the past year I have told them that if they keep their rooms clean and put away their shoes without being asked for a year, they can have a dog. Because they are 9 and 6, this was not a goal I expected them to achieve, so that was my way of dealing with it. 

This argument has surfaced other tensions in our marriage. I feel that because I earn 2/3 of our household income and manage all our finances I deserve some direction in how we manage our house and budget. My wife feels that because my career has moved us back and forth across the country she deserves some 'gives' in things like, well, having a dog. 

We had a volatile conversation about this last night, during which my wife made a compelling and impassioned plea for having a dog, and how much the kids would enjoy it. I hear where she's coming from, but I feel like I'm being overruled, impotent, and just inviting a host of new hassles into my life if I acquiesce.

There is a small hole where you can get underneath the house when it’s dry, but it is full of water when it rains.

My mom told me not to do it and wait for the pump to drain it, but the rain was picking back up and the pump doesn’t go fast so he could’ve been trapped down there for a long time. I decided that since I heard him crying for help under house that I would save him from that terrifying experience and feel good about it.

When my sister was living in Canada we both would borrow each other's clothing which wasn't really a problem until she decided she didn't want me to use her clothing anymore for some reason. I was fine with this because I didn't really want her to wear my clothing either.  

Anyway's I don't live with my parent's anymore but they needed to go away for the night so they asked if I could stay at their place so I could make sure the dogs were okay. I was happy to do it so they could go out. I invited a friend to come with me for some drinks and a hot tub.

I apologized but i feel like she's over reacting and that she was a little mean about it? I wouldn't usually wear her stuff without asking but I didn't have anything else i could wear and it's not like she was using it or was going to take it home with me.

"So a few weeks back me and my girlfriend had taken a trip to Tunisia which I paid for in full for her birthday. We had a great time plenty of sun tanning plenty to eat and drink, all in all the good standard for any holiday. 

We get ready and packed to leave on Friday morning 6:45 sharp and with a good nights sleep. 

Get to the front of the hotel and we find out our flight has been cancelled and we won’t be flying out till 5am the following morning! Yet the holiday rep said you can have your hotel rooms back and due to the amount of delay (pretty much a day) we will get a full refund on the holiday.......fucking happy days ! Another day in the sun by the pool and a holiday paid for ! 

So as we sat by the pool my girlfriend says “halves then yeah ?” So I asked “half on what ?”
“The money.”  “What the refund ? No it’s my money.” 

Well that was it then, she ranted on how that out of principle she should get half. Which takes the tale back a few weeks. 

She had just bought a brand new Mercedes A-class after only been driving for a year and a bit and I mean the 2019 model all the bells and whistles. Her insurance company who I’m also with was asking an extra £900 to insure the A-class on-top of the £1200 annual she had already put down on her previous car only so many months ago (thanks to mummy and daddy). At this point she nearly didn’t get the merc until I said that I’ll speak about putting her on my multi car cover. 

After a bit of a chat with them I was able to get her insurance for £300 and have a £1000 refunded to her. Again happy days and yet using the logic that she is using over the holiday refund I should have been given £500 off the back of that, yet I didn’t. Because as I’ve always seen it “it ain’t my money anyway”. It belongs rightfully to her. Yet the previous year when she first started driving I handed over £1200 for her first insurance and I’ve never asked for it back ! As I told her “it’s in your account now go and sort it and let’s get you out, happy birthday” 

Yet I’ve had her turn friends against me a little over it and how I’m “proper tight” yet the money I’m getting back is all mine she didn’t pay for anything on the holiday. 

It’s been playing on me for a while and it’s made me feel like shit, I’ve told her that if anything the money could go on another holiday and I need the money for collage in September. 

But no. “I’m out of order” 

So guys AITH ? 

TLTR : got a full refund on a holiday I paid for, gf thinks I’m an arsehole for not wanting to share the refund it despite getting her a lot of money back a couple weeks ago, I never asked for the share so why should she.

Edit: thank you for all the support guys, sometimes I feel as if I’m struggling to just get common sense across to her but I’m the same breath she is a lovely gf very affectionate and does do stuff for me back she isn’t a terrible person, just as you’ve mostly put it become somewhat entitled lately."

"I’ve been really apprehensive about sharing this but oh well 🤷‍♀️ so I found out I had a half brother when I was 9 and really wrecked my family. My dad had a girlfriend and when he went off to college she got pregnant but never told him as he was out of the state. That’s her reasoning idk why tho. She decided to tell him like 20 years later after he was married and had kids.

So I met him for the first time in person about 6 months ago and we hung out for a couple days since I was in his state. My parents have since been divorced for a while so I didn’t really tell either one this was happening. We talked pretty frequently when I was visiting and a little after but when I got back to my state I kind of went awol. 

I just felt so awkward and didn’t know how to add him into my life. I know it’s not his fault but I have a lot of anxiety in my everyday life without juggling both parents and their feelings as well as my siblings feelings. My older brother wants nothing to do with his family because the mom constantly insulted my mom.

 I put off responding to his texts and then before I know it it’s been 5 days since he’s texted. I reply short and to the point when he does text sometimes but it honestly gives me so much anxiety when I see his name pop up in my phone. I feel like a traitor for having a relationship with him because my

So my friend group is pretty diverse in all aspects including age. Most of us are in our late teens, this girl in question is a few years older. Me and the other people that are a bit younger enjoy goofing off, doing dares and making scenes. Basically, anything serious is boring to us. 

This girl can be really harsh, and is a serious person generally. Her boyfriend is a few years younger than her, and is a insufferable guy. He's self-centered and not fun to be around at all.

**So**, to start the story off, me and a bunch of friends were at our usual hangout spot, a youth center type place and shit was going nuts like it usually does. She decided to rudely tell us to stop.

The gist of her thing was ""you're acting like toddlers and you should sit still and act like adults"". The other guys listened to her, but I had a shitty day and I'm generally done with her serious personality shit and asked her who made her Queen Bitch or something like that.

She got all pissy, and insulted me so I told her to shut the fuck up, and go hang out with some other depressed emo fucks, or that she should learn to have fun and not be a bitch all the time. Her boyfriend went to defend her and I basically told him off to for his shitty behavior, and made a really personal jab at him. 

They were super pissed and left, my friends were 50/50 since they think I went overboard, but I really do think she's a bit of a bitch, and she has no right to tell us off. Are the 50 percent of my friends right? Was I too harsh, or was I in the right here?

**TLDR:** Me and a couple of friends were doing some fun, stupid shit, older girl I already don't like decides to rudely tell us to stop, saying we should be more serious and that we were like little kids. I told her to shut the fuck up, she got mad, I insulted her and her boyfriend very harshly and my friends are fifty fifty split on who was right. AITA or were they TA?"	Asshole	0	0

bw0g7k	2019-06-02 18:22:25		AITA Standing up for Myself	"This whole situation started when I moved to a different country, along with a school where I didn't know anyone.  I thought that it was gonna be great, but it wasn't.

&#x200B;

When I got into school, some people where nice at first, and talked to me when I came. Little did I know that everyone in that school was a snake, and soon enough, people started to talk shit about me and exclude me. I ended up with no friends for a while, but there was one new friend that I made later. 

&#x200B;

At first we were fine, but about 1 MONTH LATER she started ignoring me and fighting with me. Then we got back together and stopped fighting. But our relationship was on and off. 

&#x200B;

One day we where sitting on the swings and talking. Then we both went on tellonym (tellonym is an app where you can send messages to people anonymously, and then they answer you, also everyone in the school had it). I was rlly pissed that day, and someone sent me a question asking ""who is the girl you hate the most"". Usually I wouldn't answer it, but this time, I did. I put the name of the girl who talked the most shit about me. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, her and her friends found out about it, and me and them started getting into an text fight. They started being all fake, and people started sending me really rude shit, like ""go to hell"" or ""we don't want u here"". So I decided to do the same. I started harassing this one girl who was being rude asf, and I told her that she was a stupid hoe and to go fuck herself. I'm not a bad person, but there is a certain point where anyone will get angry at bad treatment like this.

&#x200B;

And of course, being the snitches that they are, they told the principal on me. But lucky for me, I didn't get expelled cause the school knows that I've got issues, and I was leaving soon anyway. And the friend that I made is a VERY weak person and she was on their side.

bw0g3w	2019-06-02 18:22:09	idontknow39283	AITA for letting my boyfriend borrow something a friend gifted me on my birthday?	"Throwaway because the friend in question knows my account. Also English isn't my first language so excuse moi for my bad Engles.

I(21F) had my birthday 3 months ago. A friend of mine (24M, we'll call him Jim) gifted me an awesome silly hat I've really wanted for a while for cosplay reasons (I'm a huge gaming fan/nerd and love cosplays). I was really excited and grateful.

Yesterday my boyfriend(21M) was attending a gaming event (I couldn't go because of work) and asked me to borrow my hat, which I gladly let him wear. 
Turns out Jim was also at the event and he met my boyfriend there. They didn't hang out much, but later that day after the event I got a text from Jim and he was PISSED. He asked me if I gave my hat away to my boyfriend, and I explained that I simply let him borrow it for the event. However he was still upset and said it was a gift for __me__ and not my boyfriend, and sharing gifts like that is extremely rude and inconsiderate. 

I apologized if I [unintentionally] hurt his feelings but also asked, don't I have the right to decide what I do with the hat, as it has become my item after he's gifted it to me? To which he responded yeah whatever, but I was still an asshole for giving it to someone else. I said if his gift comes with so many conditions, I would rather give it back to him. He got defensive saying that wasn't necessary and I'm overreacting.

We haven't continued that discussion since then and I've been wondering if I was an asshole for letting my boyfriend borrow something that was gifted to me.

That's it. Naturally my GF heard and is saying that if I have friend zoned her and therefore we have broken up.

My argument: This is a weird relationship and for ages I've been the one that'd never get a girlfriend so even though it's been 6 months I still find it weird referring to my GF as my GF. Because she wasn't there I just said I was talking to a friend to keep identity anonymous and because saying I was talking to my GF seems really weird to me when she's not there. I've tried explaining this.

"My friend is moving into a new town soon enough and has no job as of this moment and is living off of the only money she has in her savings, which is really not a lot especially for the college town. She is planning on living full time in the town soon to make it easier on her to stay in her university, as her family is moving away across the country (USA). Normally she keeps her cat at her parent's place, but as her parents are moving the only options are for her to take the cat up to the college town or allow her father to take the cat with him.

While my friend does love the cat, she cannot afford a place that would be pet friendly in the college town and can barely afford staying there at all especially without a job. Not only that, but she is comfortably able to live in the town without needing the emotional support of the animal as she has been staying in the town for school already for the past year. I understand missing your pet and wanting to see them, which are emotions she does show while in the town, but I don't think that should qualify as the cat being an ESA. I also don't think she could support the cat's needs anyways while she can barely support her own, due to being jobless.

Her father is still willing to care for the cat while across the country and can easily care for her, as he has been the one taking care of the cat while my friend has been in the town. She also has never been to a therapist before and her family is moving in July, so she really does not have time for the full process (in my opinion) to register the cat correctly as an emotional support animal without buying one of those certificates online.

So in the famous book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", on around 3 pages total, the N-Word is said which is quickly corrected and eventually reaches a bad tone instead of being thrown around for the sake of it. It's used as a way to show that racism and social inequalities between races was and is wrong.

The classroom that I was in was made up of a couple black people but most were white. We were reading To Kill a Mockingbird and it was a classroom exercise for us to be able to learn together and at each others' pace. Sure enough, I was asked to read on one of the pages where the N-Word was mentioned.
Unfortunately for me, I was not thinking of what I was doing, and so I began to actually say the N-Word before I stopped around halfway in, and I apologised for it. The class went ahead and next period arrived.

Sure enough, the people that were of black descent began to berate me for not looking where I was going. This actually didn't stop until we all split for college. It didn't leave a mark on my record however I'm still in a bit of confusion as to whether I am the asshole or not.

TLDR - said a bit of the N-Word while reading To Kill a Mockingbird, resulting in all of the black people in my past classroom berating me.

I went to college in Colorado. I'm in California. I'm not currently in school.

After one and a half quarters this year, I moved out for mental health reasons. Because we lived on campus I could do this without her being charged extra each quarter. In that move I completely cleaned out my room, which was then inspected and locked. For about 5 months since then my roommate has been living by herself.

I left some of my things there for her to use. I left my piano, the TV, my plates, pots, pans, slow cooker and baking sheets. I understand flying out to pack up these things and throw them into storage. I get that.

What I dont get is that she wants me to help clean. She would have to vacuum, mop, clean her food out of the fridge, wipe down the counters, clean the shower. I would feel more obligated to go if not just two weeks ago I visited her and deep cleaned the fridge/scrubbed the toilet.

I want to just pay my bro who lives in the same area to pack my stuff and put it in storage. He would be cheaper than the plane tickets out there, but he wouldnt clean. And I dont feel like he/we need to.

The mother then started to attack me in broken German and said something like the kid is autistic and likes to scream, I should get along with it or move. I apologised and went back home.

bw094r	2019-06-02 18:05:07		AITA for not giving my parents $1,000 out of a car insurance settlement?	"Hello.

&#x200B;

Some context before I get into it. I've lived at home for the entirety of my life and went to school and graduated from a community college around my home town. My parents gave me an older car for my birthday when I received my license at 16. The car was a relative's of mine given to us after they had passed. The car was in pretty decent shape and runs well enough to get me from point A to B but it had some very minor cosmetic issues, nothing super noticeable but would be noticed upon closer inspection. I've used this car from since receiving my license to today to get to and from work.

&#x200B;

I was able to get a great job once I finished with my degree program straight out of college. Over the winter months, I had ice damage from an icicle which had fallen from my work's building damage my car. The damage was luckily just cosmetic but it would have been around $1,000 to fix the body of the car. The car itself still operates fine but now the cosmetic damage is pretty noticeable. We had to get in contact with the building's insurance company who, at first, refused to pay out any money for the damages since falling ice from a building generally doesn't get a payout in my state, or so I'm lead to believe. After a lot of back and forth between one of my parents and the insurance company they sent me a check for around $3,000. 

&#x200B;

I was pretty stoked because I plan on using this 3k to pay off some student loan debt as well as pay off an unexpected hospital bill. After I told my parents about the check, they've been incredibly hostile and distant. This is entirely unlike them as our relationship has been stellar as they've allowed me to live at home without having to pay rent. They've also laughed at me when I've offered to pay rent as they continually told me while I was going to university and working that I would never have to pay rent. When I told them what I was going to do with the money, they began to tell me ""how ungrateful"" I was and how ""terrible I treat them"". 

&#x200B;

I was originally planning on giving my mother around $300 or even $500 because I know if she hadn't made those phone calls to talk with the building's insurance company I would never have had the 3k. I just feel like after they've done a total 180 on me over $1,000 our relationship has been soured. AITA?"		1	0

We met in August 2018 and became close friends. Since then, we have grown a really strong bond. Over the months we would harmlessly flirt or just make cheeky remarks. Id say something like ""cute butt"" or ""nice tits"" and shed just laugh. Eventually she started returning them, saying I was really handsome, had gorgeous eyes, and so on. Her BF didn't really like me, mostly because spoke highly of me to him (eg I was hard working, got good grades,and so on). But he knew we never did anything and that she was loyal to him. 

I never tried to have sex with her, kiss her, or anything. Even hugging I restrained myself from doing (occasionally I would but that was rare - maybe three times in those 9 months). A few nights ago we met up after I got out of work (around 10pm). She wanted to see the place I work out and how things work (I intern at an engineering facility). Afterward we sat in my car listening to music and just being goofy. 

Eventually we locked eyes and none of us pulled away. She said ""I had a dream about you"". I asked ""what dream?"" and she said it was about sex (got pretty detailed). I jokingly said something like ""dreams are often what we seek in reality"" or something like that. She then leaned in and kissed me. One thing led to a next and we were both pulling our pants down and had sex. 

Afterward my heart sunk, I was SO guilty, I seriously felt sick because of what we did. I wanted to have sex and never did bc her BF, but of course now we did. She said ""Zach would kill you if he knew about this."" I just told her ""Don't tell him, this cant happen again - lets just pretend it didn't""

Fast forward to today, her and I continue talking like nothing happened and that were all 'good'... 

But the guilt is eating me still. I knew if my (future) GF did that to me I would be devastated. IK its not my place to tell Zach so I wont but I feel so bad. I talked to my friend  and she told me I myself wasn't wrong, that I wasn't committed to anyone.  And the fact I didn't make the first move shows I respected that too...

bw03a3	2019-06-02 17:50:51		AITA for dating a guy as part of a deal with my mom?	"Me and my family are Navajo and my mom is really adamant about me dating only within our race. For years, I've tried to get her to loosen her grip on my dating life, but to no avail. I still live with my mom and she's very controlling, so I've had to reject some really nice guys simply because they're white and my mom would do anything in her power to get in the way of a potential relationship. And just last year, I went on a secret date with a white guy. I really grew to like him and I still like him a lot to this day, but my mom has already told me that I'm not to date him.

Just last month, me and my mom were attending a Native event and afterwards, she told me that she wanted to set me up on a date with a Native guy that she met there. I initially told her that I'm not interested, but my mom was really pressuring me to give him a chance. I reminded her that there's a really nice white guy who she already shot down, so she said that she'd cut me a deal. I argued that I want my own say in who I date, especially since the Native guys she sets me up with always end up being assholes. She said that if I give this Native guy a chance at dating and even a relationship and things don't work out, then she'll let me pursue this white guy and stop pressuring me to date only Natives. She said that I have to give ""one more shot"" at a Native. But she said that I genuinely have to give the Native a chance, so I agreed.

Me and this Native guy went on a few dates and he actually started out really nice. As of just last month, we're in an exclusive relationship. I have been giving him a real shot, but there's undeniably a part of the relationship that feels forced because of how it was my mom who set us up. Still, I've been giving him a shot. We just went camping this weekend, I've met his mom and aunts, and we see each other when we can.

The main reason I'm here is because feel like I'm using this guy simply to get to another guy. I honestly feel like an asshole for being with this native guy and still having the white guy in the back of my head. It's just that the white guy seems like a one in a million guy, whereas my current boyfriend simply seems like one of the millions. It's just that I've been living under my mom's rule for so long (I still live under her roof) and I see this deal is an opportunity to finally get some freedom in my life.

Scott and I come from very different. He is a tradesman, but is skilled enough to earn a very good wage. He left school at 16 and spent all the time working and developing his skills. His family are very working class and are proud of their roots. 

I come from a very different background. My parents are both professionals. I was privately educated and have been to university, and now work in finance. 

Scott's parents themselves worked incredibly hard to build a better life for themselves, and they instilled that work ethic into Scott and his brother and sister.

The problem is that Sam and Charlotte (his brother and sister) see him as a sellout for marrying someone from a different sort of background to them. It's never been said but I know they consider me to be a spoiled brat who has always got what I want. In the past Scott has been made fun of for being with ''one of *them*'' as though my background makes me different. Scott's parents have never been anything but lovely to me and his mum even says that I'm like a second daughter.

Yesterday Scott and Sam had a bit of an argument about parking spaces at a family dinner. When I tried to say something in agreement with Scott, Sam's wife Mel shouted for me to shut up and called me a ''posh b****''. I was so upset and ended up crying in the car. 

I've told Scott that I don't want Lucia seeing his side of the family- with the exception of her grandparents.

bw011a	2019-06-02 17:45:14	LazzyAssed	AITA for eating ice cream in the parking lot?	"This happened two days ago. I asked my sister about this, but I still can’t stop thinking about it so I figured I would ask y’all.

The other night I helped my (other) sister with an errand after she got off work. On my way home I started to crave pizza so I went to a local spot for a slice and a beer. While eating there I remembered my favorite ice cream place is just around the corner. So once I was finished with my pizza I went to get ice cream. 

The ice cream joint was packed. The line went quickly enough and pretty soon I had my favorite ice cream in hand: black cherry chocolate chip in a dipped and sprinkled waffle cone.

Since the place was so packed there wasn’t any seating inside or on either the front patio or the small bench outside by the parking lot. And, since ice cream isn’t something that has a long shelf life once it’s in a cone, I started to eat it as looked around for a place to sit. I couldn’t find one so I walked over to my truck, dropped the tailgate, and sat on it as I continued to eat my ice cream.

About 90 seconds later an elderly woman pulls up right in front of me, stops, rolls down her window and asks “Are you going to be much longer?”

It takes me a second but then I realize she wants my parking spot. I looked at the substantial ice cream cone still in my hand, looked at her, then said “no...but I’m going to finish this first.”

Then she says that she’ll wait. And she puts her car in reverse, backs up about 10ft, then just sits in her car and stares at me with her blinkers on.

Now, there’s no way in hell I’m going to deprive an old lady of ice cream. But for some reason I started to feel so bad about my role in this situation that I just stood up, put the tailgate back up, got in my truck and left. I felt weird, like I had been a jerk. And even worse, I had to eat my ice cream while driving home and more of it didn’t get in my mouth than the amount of it that did. Was I an asshole for taking up a parking space while I ate my ice cream? Or should I have just told the old lady something like, yes I will be a while, and just finished my ice cream at my own pace?

I want to go back again this weekend. But if seating is just as limited or unavailable I don’t know what other choices I’ll have other than to eat in my truck bed again. AITA for eating it in the back of my truck again?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So I met someone on PUBG Mobile who was chinese, playing on American servers, I guess he was searching for friends from the USA, (im mexican btw) but him and me were talking for a bit, he told me to follow him on twitter and we continued talking there for some days, we were ""friends"".

I saw something weird, he posted a picture of two teenagers kissing, both men, I asked him about it and he (and his boyfriend) are gay, a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one (btw im not gay), he even made me a ""QQ"" account so we could chat without him needing to bypass the (iirc) chinese great firewall and I met one of his friends, a weird but cool experience overall, chinese social media is weird. 

So we tried to play pubg for some weeks, but our schedules never coincided and we only played once, he had also a bad english so he used translator so we could chat, QQ was all in chinese so it was very confusing for me, and talking with him was very time consuming because I have to work and go to school.

He showed me his face (in a pic) and told me I was handsome, He hadnt even seen me! I was weirded out by that, I felt that he was going to pressure me next to show my face, and I ghosted him, even though he didnt.

Was I wrong to do that? he was 16, he never talked too much about it but told me his family didnt like him being gay, but he was open about it with his bf over QQ. He said how the gov didnt approve of gay people but it was ""slowly changing"", this happened maybe 9 months ago or so, maybe im not the asshole but I feel like I shouldnt have ghosted him :/

bw00cn	2019-06-02 17:43:28	lestcatsbloom	AITA for leaving my family's groupchat because of a parrot?	"As a birthday gift about 8 years ago, my brother and I \[18m&f\] got a parrot. It was all well until we (with our parents) moved out to a new country and had to leave the parrot back. All was okay and the parrot made my grandma and grandpa some company. Their son (my uncle) \[40s\] moved back in with them in the meantime. He's known to always pick fights and just be a hypocrite and a terrible person in general.

&#x200B;

So, a week ago, my grandfather passed away. The family is still in a delicate situation. All of a sudden, my uncle sends a ""poetic"" message in the groupchat, saying that our parrot ""went to look for grandpa""... What? Both my brother and I tried to find out what the hell he was talking about, all the while knowing that he must've been annoyed with the parrot and just let it go. But he made up some bullshit excuse, explaining that he was feeding the bird outside (the parrot stays inside of the house, but sometimes we take it in its cage out for some sunlight) and left the cage door open, for some reason. Then, to top it off, he blames US for ""teaching the bird how to runaway""? 

&#x200B;

My brother and I left the groupchat then. As of now, our father is taking my uncle's side, but our mom agrees with us. That's where the story ends, for now.

&#x200B;

TL;DR / Uncle released my brother's and my parrot, but won't admit to it. He insulted us and we left the groupchat."	Not the A-hole	0	0

There’s this really annoying family friend that we had known for a few years. I’m sick of them but my parents keep on being lenient to them while they keep on doing things that harms us. Here’s some examples:
1. When they moved to another city they asked us to keep some of their stuff and we did in our basement along with other people’s stuff we also help keep. Once they came back and claimed something is missing, they start rummaging through our house, at which my dad stopped right away. When we moved, they won’t do the same.
2. They buy all their furniture, appliances, etc from garage sells. Walks into my house in which my mom bought a new appliance or whatever and they’d just stand there talking about what they don’t like about it.
3. Some neighbourhood kids played a prank on their house, and their younger daughter came to my house and starts crying. Like how is this related to us?
4. Their oldest daughter (19) hit my brother (11), and their mother barged into my house (literally, didn’t knock, as if it’s their house; I left the doors unlocked cause my siblings were playing outside), and started lecturing me. “You have something against my family don’t you?” Where do they get the audacity to do such things?
5. When they invite guests to eat at their house they always come to my house to ask for this or that. Like they can’t buy their own food before hand? 
6. Don’t invite us? Whatever, but they call late afternoon with all of their guests there and be like “come to my house and eat”. Lol wtf. We’re not beggars. Why should I go to your house?
7. When we have guests over, their whole family just barges in and starts eating. 
8. They stalk our house. On Halloween the older sister wanted to ditch her younger sister with us. They called my house as soon as we got inside the house. I made a point to bring my siblings to her house and ask her mom why can’t her older sister take the younger one. So her mom took the youngest trick or treating. The next day, she complains to my mom about how she had to take my siblings trick or treating and make dinner for her older daughters friend and how tiring this all was. Like how is this related to us?
9. That women got her current job thanks to my mom, and when my mom went to see if I can get a job there, that women just blocks the way. Not like I even want to work there. But it’s infuriating.

bvzzv1	2019-06-02 17:42:17		AITA for dating a guy as part of a deal with my mom?	"Me and my family are Navajo and my mom is really adamant about me dating only within our race. For years, I've tried to get her to loosen her grip on my dating life, but to no avail. I still live with my mom and she's very controlling, so I've had to reject some really nice guys simply because they're white and my mom would do anything in her power to get in the way of a potential relationship. And just last year, I went on a secret date with a white guy. I really grew to like him and I still like him a lot to this day, but my mom has already told me that I'm not to date him.

Just last month, me and my mom were attending a Native event and afterwards, she told me that she wanted to set me up on a date with a Native guy that she met there. I initially told her that I'm not interested, but my mom was really pressuring me to give him a chance. I reminded her that there's a really nice white guy who she already shot down, so she said that she'd cut me a deal. I argued that I want my own say in who I date, especially since the Native guys she sets me up with always end up being assholes. She said that if I give this Native guy a chance at dating and even a relationship and things don't work out, then she'll let me pursue this white guy and stop pressuring me to date only Natives. She said that I have to give ""one more shot"" at a Native. But she said that I genuinely have to give the Native a chance, so I agreed.

Me and this Native guy went on a few dates and he actually started out really nice. As of just last month, we're in an exclusive relationship. I have been giving him a real shot, but there's undeniably a part of the relationship that feels forced because of how it was my mom who set us up. Still, I've been giving him a shot. We just went camping this weekend, I've met his mom and aunts, and we see each other when we can.

The main reason I'm here is because feel like I'm using this guy simply to get to another guy. I honestly feel like an asshole for being with this native guy and still having the white guy in the back of my head. It's just that the white guy seems like a one in a million guy, whereas my current boyfriend simply seems like one of the millions. It's just that I've been living under my mom's rule for so long (I still live under her roof) and I see this deal is an opportunity to finally get some freedom in my life. I'm giving her pick a chance so that she can finally give my pick a chance. What do you think?"		1	0
bvzzl2	2019-06-02 17:41:34	LockOutDrama	AITA after getting accidentally locked out at 1 a.m.?	"I arrived home a little after 1 a.m. yesterday (today?) only to realize I was locked out. My guess was that my new flatmate, with whom I've lived for only a month, had left his keys in the lock from the inside, making me unable to turn my key from the outside. It's his flat, btw. 

I messaged and called nearly a dozen times each. Rang the bell, knocked loudly, and nothing worked. At the 25-minute mark, I started feeling a little angry.

I was flat-out exhausted, tired, and needed to pee. I had put up with my new flatmate constantly forgetting to lock the door before leaving, playing loud music at 7:30 a.m. on the weekends, and being an overall space case who talks more about what he's doing than actually doing it properly. We are both in our 30s. I know he doesn't mean to cause annoyance, but last night hit a limit for me.

Finally, he wakes up and opens the door. I'll admit, I did the wrong thing by barging in past him and slamming my bedroom door after peeing. He messaged me on Whatapp that he was sorry but that I had scared him half to death because he still half-asleep.  We agreed to talk in person the next day and politely messaged good-night. 

Fast forward to this afternoon. The convo started out fine until he let loose a detail that meant he had yet again forgotten to lock the door after leaving later than me. Once I caught on, he realized he fucked up extra bad. There have been multiple break-ins in our neighborhood lately evident by the official police notices downstairs at the main door.

He apologized again and assured it wouldn't happen another time, then proceeded to tell me what I could have done differently last night. Some of his advice included: (1) using the city toilet in the dark park across the street, and (2) not barging on and slamming my door. I agree I shouldn't have passive-aggressively shown my anger like that, but I felt that his pointers reduced the effectiveness of his apology. He told me I shouldn't hace ""panicked,"" but at what point is panic all right when you've been locked out for half an hour late at night and badly need to pee? I told him this. 

The convo ended with me feeling like I was being critiqued when I had been inconvenienced. It felt like he was minimizing his role in leaving me out in the stairwell for 30 min. late at night. I left almost in tears because I really don't want to have to find a new place to live so soon. 

Please tell me, AITA here? I'm honestly ready to look for a new place to live because his pointers really messed with me. I'm angrier now than last night on the stairwell."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My friend, who I’ll call Jade, was saying that she’ll go eat straight cinnamon. I advised her against it, as she’s allergic to it. I said, “you could die if you eat it”. She said, “and?”. And I said, “Well if you don't care about your own life don't expect me to”. She got really upset at this, because her abusive ex-boyfriend said something along the same lines. I felt really bad about this, and she’s says that I’m like him in terms of reaction (which I really disagree). The thing that’s been bothering me is that I DONT want to be ANYTHING like her ex, and she’s now comparing me to him.

bvzs9u	2019-06-02 17:23:35		Aita For no longer accepting the same apology?	"Obligatory throw away as they know my account. Tldr at the bottom. Please excuse my English, it's not my first language.

I've been with my so for 5 years. They've gotten me through so many hard times. Uni, my dad doing, my family splitting up, my depression, you name it. And through that they've helped me be a better person. 

However, whilst I've had my issues brought from an abusive upbringing with my birth mother, they too have suffered at the hands of a parent. because of this, both of us can be snappy - which sounds normal, we get over it quite fast, but it even happens during our streams so other people end up in the middle of a snappy retort that I always end up backing down from, as I don't actually like confrontation.

They always apologise when they snap, mainly because they end up shouting, and I do the same if I do. Please note, we are good at working things through, but they live with the idea of: once you apologise, you drop it. You can't be upset or hurt after. Or at least shouldn't. Which may work for them, but we're both on the spectrum and that's not at all how I function. They know this.

Today again, they snapped. I had literally just said I wanted to get stuff to do a cold platter for tonight. Tomorrow I have a big interview and I'm stressed over it, but I have everything planned. As per, they asked me how far, so they could lend me train fare (which I didn't ask for. I've been out of work for a little while but I work every weekend and was using the money from that. I appreciated the offer though.) Then they asked how far from the train station. 

Well, off the top of my head, I didn't know. I knew it was direct and not too far, but I planned on getting there an hour early to be on time regardless. I said I wasn't going to look right then and there (as I'd just said I wanted to do a thing, and when I have a plan it's very hard for me to change it, which those who are the same spectrum probably know) and I've had to do so often lately that just for this one thing, I wanted to do it my way.

So they snapped again. Shouted until I did it. And once again apologised after telling me that they just want to help, but I don't make it easy for them. I never ask for the help unless I need it and they know that. It grates a little that when I set plans, they ALWAYS check for themselves. And if they read something differently, there's an excuse. Today it was ""the Trainline website is a heap of shit."" Because that's what I was using.

So today I walked back downstairs, to the comment of ""so your ignoring me now?"" And sat down to write this.

Aita for not wanting to accept the apology? They used to be far far worse (as did I) but we both are better at communication, believe it or not, but this is something they never ever seen to understand, no matter how many times I ask them not to. We both grew up in abusive households, and we worked hard to make ours safe. Is it me that needs to change the most? Should I just ""let it in one ear and out the other"" as my dad used to say?"		1	0
bvzrvx	2019-06-02 17:22:39	stativus	AITA for not refunding tickets?	"So I bought these really nice tickets at an auction because they were originally like $250 but the lowest bid (which I won) was $50.

But the problem was, the date for the show was right in the middle of finals week. So I sadly sold off the tickets to a classmate for $50 (ie zero profit for me).

The tickets were an e-voucher sort of thing, so to transfer them I had to email the venue to get them to send the tickets to my classmate instead of me, and they confirmed it was okay and everything. They said they'd only send out tickets a week before the performance.

But my classmate just texted me saying that she mistakenly thought the date of the show was a week later than it was (because she hadn't received the actual tickets from the venue, she assumed it was the week after and didn't think anything of it), missed the show, and now she wants her money back.

She even offered to split it 50/50.

My issue is I don't really want to give her anything back especially because I feel like I could have sold the tickets for a higher price to someone else. If we were close friends, I think I would do it, but I honestly feel like this wasn't my responsibility.

I guess $25 isn't that much, so am I the asshole for not wanting to give it to her?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I told her the correct date and time and address when I sold the tickets. I'm not sure what the situation with the venue was--my only info is what she told me, which is that the venue didn't send her the tickets so she assumed the show wasn't up yet.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: thanks everyone I think I'm good now. I feel really bad that she missed the show (she was planning on taking her 6yo sister who was sooo excited) but all I'm going to do is help her contact the venue to see what's up with the tickets/why they weren't sent/etc. and I'm going to keep my $25."

"We’ve been living together for a few months and thankfully we’re breaking the lease early due to constant arguments, but here’s the latest one where i’m apparently branded as an asshole. So for the past two weeks my roommate has had her younger siblings stay over around 6 times, I think their ages are 4, 7, 9, 10 and 11? I don’t mind them staying over as she’s obviously entitled to have them visit, i’ve told her this, but she plans on making this a constant thing, meaning they’re going to be staying over pretty much all the time until we move out. I’m definitely not okay with this. I do nightshifts and they’re loud during the day which means I’m loosing sleep, they sleep in the living room meaning I can’t spend time in there whenever I want, they use my TV meaning I’m bored in my room waiting for them to finish watching whatever. I honestly feel like I’m living in a daycare instead of my own fucking home. I brought this up to my roommate that I’m not okay with them staying over this much and she’s basically told me they can stay over whenever she likes because she pays rent too. I think she’s being completely unreasonable, I shouldn’t have to live in a place which I also pay for where there’s always kids around and I don’t get a say. Hell, she even told me I can’t cook tonight (early hours I’m awake because nightshifts sleeping patterns) because they’d be asleep in the living room (kitchen is also in living room), it took an argument and her calling me a ‘joke’ for her to agree for them to sleep in her room just for tonight. Oh, they’re also staying over tomorrow too. Yay. Am I the asshole?

EDIT- I would just like to quickly add that not all 5 of them stay over at the same time, it’s usually 3 one day, 2 the next, 4 the day after etc. My TV is also in my room, it’s taken into the living room while I’m on shift but when I come home I have to wait hours to get it back.

We live in a Catholic country and she is deeply Catholic: she goes to church every week, always volounteers and helps people with difficulties and goes to almost every christian encounter in our city.

I've been baptised and all so I am formally a Catholic, but in reality I don't believe in it,  I have my own opinion about religion and I never liked going to Church. When I was young I was forced to go with my family, and when I said my mom I didn't believe in God anymore (never believed in reality) and I didn't want to go she snapped saying that I focused myself only on useless things and that the strenght I could find in God was the most important for a fullfilling life.

She the said:""until you live under my roof, you'll go to church."" Since I don't have the intention of changing my mind I decided to fake it and not really going to church.

She also wants me to listen to long speeches of priests on YouTube and  partecipate to a Catholic trip with other guys from my country.

I don't have nothing against her being Christian but I hate when people try to force others to join their religion. I don't want to go to this trip but I feel like I'm forced to and if I tell her the real reason she would scold me. I feel like I have to pretend until I'm 18.

I dont bring it up and don't plan to, no need to make waves, but I'm doing spring cleaning and I want to throw out or donate this stuff. As Kondo would say it doesnt 'spark joy' and its taking up a lot of space. However, my mom insists I keep it, as my family would be hurt.

&#x200B;

My friend and I went out for a few drinks at a restaurant near us, and he ordered wings with the first round of drinks. We were there for about an hour and a half, and were getting ready to leave, and my friend went to the restroom. While he was away, the waiter came out and said that he forgot to write down my friend's wing order, and he offered to put the order in  right then. I said that it's ok, my friend probably forgot he ordered them too, and we're not staying that much longer anyway. He said ok, left, and then a minute later came back with who I think was the manager of the restaurant. She said that this was an unacceptable error on his part, and that since the kitchen was closed, he needs to personally buy us wings from somewhere else. She made him take out his wallet and leave a $20 bill on the table, and she said that we wouldn't need to pay for anything we had tonight, they'd cover it. I was saying ""no, that's fine, we're fine with paying our regular bill for the drinks"" but she said that she wouldn't accept that. 

&#x200B;

They left, and when the waiter was going around to other tables I went up to him and gave him back his money and said I'm sorry his manager was rude with him. He said thanks and went on. My friend came back and I told him that since they forgot the wings the manager said our bill is covered tonight. He was happy, we left a tip for our waiter, and we left spending about $5 each for 3 nice craft beers.

Yesterday we walked past and he mentioned the story, and I told him how the manager made our waiter ""pay us"" and that I returned the money.

 We just got back from New York and we were invited over lunch. I wasn’t super keen to go but I went because she was hanging with my family in New York for the past four days. Anyways we get here and her sister is like “let’s watch the wedding video” so they put it in and they start watching it and it is 3 hours long. This isn’t an exaggeration, it is literally 3 hours and 12 minutes. The wedding video is from the early 90s and aren’t in the same style as they are now. We are now at a 20 minute scene of them shaking peoples hands walking in. 

Now I’m bored af and I am browsing reddit. My girlfriend is getting mad at me and calling me rude because I’m on reddit instead of watching.

Not to be petty and be like “My GiRlFrIeNd DoEs ThE sAmE tHiNg” but my girlfriend always has her head in her phone, we go out for dinner she’s on insta, I like to joke that her favorite sport is watching TV.

"A mild one but my wife and roommate agreed to go on a trip together (with me as well of course), and roommate (John) is backing out. I told John that there was a 50% cancelation fee so he is responsible for one third of that 50%.

But I still want to go on the trip. When John found out, he said that he shouldn’t have to pay a cancelation fee if we were still going. But I argued that we got a bigger Air B&B than we needed to accommodate the extra person so this is just evening out the price to what we would have paid for a 1-bedroom place.

John insists that the right thing to do is find someone else to go (we don’t have anyone else we’d want to go with), to cancel the whole thing, or to pay the whole thing. 

I see where he’s coming from but I still feel like my solution is reasonable, and anything else is unfair to my wife and I, where we either have to change our plans and lose money for nothing, go with someone we are not comfortable going with or pay for an extra bedroom that will lay empty.

bvzit3	2019-06-02 17:00:36	h00manbeans	AITA for telling my boyfriend he ruined a game for me?	"He is a gamer. I am barely a casual gamer. He likes those games where idling builds up resources and you basically just click a lot to allocate them and level up and buy stuff. It's very hands off. Some of his faves of the genre are clicker heroes and the one with investment banking. However he has a wide variety of tastes and has over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ps4 games of all genres. I've been going through a rough time emotionally and mentally due to a combination of my mother being ill and running out of mental health meds. He's been wonderful to me and very supportive to the point I feel bad because I know I've  been a plateful. A barrel full. A truckload of a mess. I cannot understate his level of support and love. 

A couple weeks before all this I downloaded a game called amazing monsters which is like the clicker thing I guess but a little more involved. Before all this started I was really enjoying it because of the graphics (I'm very visual). I downloaded it to try and find a game we could do together. Well since I have been feeling bad I have been more passive about playing but really enjoying our newfound shared interest and sharing the game with him. The dynamic started that he was helping make strategic decisions and we would share the clicking and leveling. As I've become more sad Ive wanted to play, but his interest in the game has become more powerful and he eventually started picking it up without me even being there. 

Last night I had no satisfying distraction because throughout the evening he had been periodically checking my game resources and allocating them without even telling me. My character has leveled up several times from his efforts and I had nothing to do with it. I felt left out of something I started. If I hazard a guess he felt like he was helping me to be stronger in game. This morning he woke up after it had finally idled for a while and immediately asked for it. I told him I wanted to do it and let it idle more. He insisted on seeing my laptop and I told him that he's really ruining the game for me. He brushed it off in a playful way and grabbed my laptop. I told him again I'm serious, you're taking all the satisfaction out of this for me. You've ruined the game for me because you only don't play when it has to idle and then there's nothing for me to do. He doesn't even consult me on which heroes I want to level or what to spend my resources on. This went back and forth with him being playful and me being serious. He then got visibly upset and walked out of the house. AITA for telling him he's ruined the game by making it his? I don't feel a part of it anymore at all."	Not the A-hole	0	0

He told me and my brother (12) about his sexuality 2 years ago because he got a boyfriend. Our country is conservative, so I didn't understand and I was angry because all I knew about gay people were TV stereotypes. But now I've learned things aren't that simple and I accept my dad more.

However I haven't told my two best friends about my dad's relationship or sexuality yet, even though we tell each other a lot of personal stuff. When I talk about visiting my dad, I just mention his boyfriend as his roommate. I'm worried my friends wouldn't accept him because they're very religious and they think homosexuality is sin, want to stop gay pride parades and so on.

It's a very special group chat to me , on my birthday they changed the group name to ' A Day For OP ' and the group dp was my pic .

Last night I went to a comedy show with a guy I’ve been casually seeing for 6+ months. When we first started seeing each other, things were a little more serious. Well as life goes, that initial spark started to die and we started fighting a lot. We stayed friends but things haven’t been physical in a while. We talked about it and agreed that trying to pursue anything more than friendship wasn’t a good idea for us. So a few nights ago I hooked up with someone and I ended up with a hickey. I was pissed because I’ve always seen that as trashy but it happened before I could stop it. I did my absolute best to cover it not only with makeup but my hair and I even tried to keep the collar of my jacket over it. Basically, I failed and the guy saw it. He was pissed and wouldn’t talk to me for the rest of the night aside from comments here and there along the lines of, “why didn’t you just bring him?” I feel terrible because I wasn’t trying to hurt him. After our initial conversation, I didn’t think he would be that upset about it but still tried to keep it covered out of respect. AITA here?	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvzh3e	2019-06-02 16:56:18	ToInfinityandBirds	WIBTA if i sell baby birds?	"So I have a pair of parrots in my flock that nature took it's course with and not we have 4 baby birds. It was Intentional to  do once i noticed they had bonded. The babies are so damn cute. My intent was to sell them. And i thought maybe to keep up but went with probably not. But the closer it gets to hand feeding time the more I'm having my doubts on things. I'm not anti-breeder by any means. Am friends with several and we talk all the time. And a breeder friend pointed out I'll have no problems selling hand raised/handfed green cheek conures. But my mother has started going ""i don't know if we should sell thrm"" ""it's gonna be hard"" 

My dad is kinda against keeping the babies but he wouldn't like actually care. I have the space and time and resources for that many parrots. And i've always told myself maybe I wouldn't mind owning upwards of 10 parrots but also im not sure that that's the best idea. And yesterday I was showing someone a photo of the babies and they pointed out ""breeders don't know what they're doing to these birds people get them and have no clue how to handle them."" And that is true for some people which is why some breeder are intense. So i half want to keep them but also know i have to draw a line *somewhere* as to whether that line is ""oh dear god i don't need to own 7 green cheek conures"" or ""just one more pair and I'm *done*"" so would I be the asshole if I sold them? 
Is that setting them up for a bad life? I'm scared they'll get attached to me or ill get attached to them and then suddenly ""i have 11 pet parrots"" will become a thing.


Sidenote: my animal-hating grandmother will probably be staying with us, i live with my parents and don't intend on moving out bc of a physical disability, and my little sister is still pissed she never got the second dog she asked for and I have 7 pet parrots."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvzfpa	2019-06-02 16:52:52	hollyWickedCity	AITA for sending my entire class an email telling them to not be so small minded, rustic and to expand their thinking?	"Basically I'm 16 years old and I've lived in the same small town that's sort of like a mix between commuter and farm town for my entire life and with a few exceptions I've gone to school with the same kids since I was in kindergarten. We were all friends pretty much or at least friendly until about last year when I went to stay with my cousin in West New York for a summer and it totally expanded my mind. I got into really obscure anime, David Lynch movies and bands like Pearl Jam and Mother Love Bone, Indigo Girls and Sam Cooke. I came back to my home town thinking people would think it was cool and what not to learn new things but I was pretty much shunned me the entire year. Do you know how lame it is to go from walking around the MET and going to art house theaters every single day to coming back to find out your class mates are dabbing and talking shit about each other on Instagram and snap?

I pretty much kept to myself for the entire year but I got a ""joke"" invite to a guy's graduation party that I'd been friends with since he was like 5 and I was 3. I know it was a joke because he put on the title ""I know you're not like the ""other girls""..."" yeah fucking so funny asshole. 

So that kind of made me snap. So I gathered up all my classmates email addresses and a few of the people I used to be close to in the senior class that just graduated and basically told them how lame I thought they all are and how most of them will never know anything besides our hometown and they will likely marry the people they are dating now and just continue this toxic cycle. I told them to open their minds and try to take a road trip this summer and watch new movies and get off social media and like at least meet other people. Like who really cares if our city might go the little league world series again? There is so much more out there.

For the first year here I got to study for free because of the good grades I got in the admission exam to the faculty. I'm afraid there's a big possibility for me not to have the same luxury in the coming year. In preparation I got a job for the summer, in order to earn my tuition fee.

When I talked to my folks about it they were extremely disappointed that I flopped and will have to probably pay for the 2nd year of college, however they said that they would 100% pay for my tuition. Out of pride I refused. 

In my opinion, although they have the means of paying (we're an upper middle class family and the tuition fee in my country is around 750 $, about 2 months of me going to work ) failing some exams and getting bad results in the rest were my fault, and thus my responsibility to take care of.

I even started listening other people who I wish were in his position right now. He mentioned how I am crazy beautiful but he could never date me, and how it hurt his feelings that I called him unattractive. So I apologized, and we continued to do makeout among other things. 

I think he just has a really big ego which I did not want to feed into. Hes the type of guy to say that all the girls come onto him, and even told me that I did come onto him. That’s when I sort of just starting bashing on him. I think what makes it worse is that I listed a lot of his friends i’d like to kiss instead of him.

bvzbpj	2019-06-02 16:43:05	sif_the_pup	WIBTA if I Left My Roommates to Fend for Themselves?	"So, I (23f) got into a sticky situation moving in with my roommate (35f). I hadn't really known her beforehand, but I needed a place to live, and so did she, and we seemed to get along. I'm in a long term relationship and she was single at the time, we both agreed overnight guests were a-okay, so nothing seemed out of the ordinary at first when she brought a guy home in the middle of the night. My boyfriend was actually over that night and we were both woken up by them coming in, but no harm done.


However, this guy just didn't leave. My roommate said he was just staying over a lot at first. I get it, sometimes my boyfriend would stay over 2-3 nights in a row. No problem. After a week of this, all of his stuff is moved in, and so are his pets (we aren't allowed to have dogs of their size) and I've gained roommate #2 (40M). Okay, a little sudden, but whatever. Dude was apparently in a failing relationship (kinda shady, I think he cheated with roommate #1) and needed help getting out of his old place. I just went along with it because if my boyfriend were in a tight spot, I'd hope she'd be understanding too.


End of the month came, we both paid rent like normal, it'd been two weeks, guy was permanently between her bedroom and the living room sofa. I wasn't able to go into my living room like normal, but still figured it was temporary. Next month, guy starts a YouTube channel and spends hours up every night speaking loudly. Still never leaves, learn he's unemployed, it's just me and her paying rent and bills....and now, another seven months later, nothing has changed. He's permanently parked between their bedroom and our living room, only does YouTube and plays games loudly, doesn't pay any bills, has moved all his stuff in, and is messy and leaves trash/food out constantly. He was neglectful with his dogs for a while and now my whole apartment smells like dog piss. I work 40 hours a week with overtime, and they dumped the dogs off on me multiple times to take care of them, and put up security cameras to ensure they were getting proper care. They didn't compensate me and expected me to, effectively, take time off work for this. He frequently eats my food and doesn't contribute to the household aside from occasionally doing dishes, but that's like once every two weeks. His dogs are very loud, I feel like we're moments from eviction at all times.

I'm 23 and I feel like I'm taking care of a 40 year old manchild. I make under $30k a year and between his YouTube videos and dogs, I'm frequently losing sleep. I'm at my wit's end and applying for apartments with my boyfriend and planning to tell my landlord she moved someone in (he's not on the lease) and taking myself off the lease due to them violating the terms/the aw with the cameras.

Basically my job is waste disposal, the factory loads up all their waste and I’m responsible for getting it out where it’ll be taken care of by another department. The job is dirty, uncomfortable, and incredibly strenuous on especially bad days. To add on, I’m also essentially viewed as one of the lower level positions of the company, so people in my department don’t get paid much respect.

bvz9vh	2019-06-02 16:38:20	Musitchman	AITA for probably killing my ex-girlfriend’s cat?	"Okay so a little backstory here: All in all, I dated my ex for a little over a year. About five months into our relationship she was evicted from her flat because her roommate had been collecting her rent and not paying the landlord. Pretty shitty, I know. Things were going pretty well between us, so I offered to let her move in to my apartment. 

One of the things she brought with her when she moved in was a cute but timid cat. I like animals so that wasn’t a problem. However, the cat had FIV (cat AIDS) and required semi-regular veterinarian visits and medications which could sometimes be hard to administer because of the cat’s fondness for hiding under the bed. 

This situation worked out pretty well until about two months ago when I was hit by a car walking home and broke nearly every bone below my chest. All things considered, my injury could’ve been much worse and although I’m temporarily confined to a wheelchair, I didn’t sustain any brain/spine injuries and I’m incredibly thankful for that. Nevertheless, the recuperation time is going to take months and unfortunately fun couple activities like going out for drinks with friends and sex (won’t get into that) suddenly became temporarily impossible. 

About a week after my injury, my girlfriend told me she needed to focus on her mental health after a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Unfortunately for me, this entailed moving back in with her parents and putting our relationship on an indefinite hold. I know that she had been struggling with those issues for a while, but this was a really difficult pill for me to swallow after the accident had left me feeling vulnerable, incapable, and pretty shook up.   

She left me with the cat, saying she’d return for it in a few weeks after clearing it with her parents. I’d learnt to really like the little guy, but caring for the cat had become exponentially more difficult with my limited mobility. Especially when it required medication and refused to make it easy by hiding under the bed.

My parents (who lived nearby) graciously offered to look after/care for the cat in the meantime. However, as they live on a farm, there are a good deal of predators nearby. I was well aware of this, but figured as long as the cat stayed inside it should be fine. As you may have guessed, the cat did not stay inside and has been missing for a few weeks. With the abundance of owls, hawks, and coyotes nearby, the cat’s chances of survival are minuscule to zero..

When I was finally able to contact my ex, I confessed the situation and she broke down. She said I intentionally tried to have her cat killed by giving it to my parents when I knew there were so many predators on the property as a form of revenge for her leaving. I know the cat meant a lot to her and was almost like a service animal when she had her anxiety/depression episodes, but I swear my actions were not vindictive in the slightest."	No A-holes here	0	0
bvz8oo	2019-06-02 16:35:18	AAAITA	AITA For not letting my SIL see my son while she is in rehab for a month?	"This is a throwaway account.

**Background info:**

I (20F) have a son who is almost 1. My sister-in-law is about 24, and is currently in rehab for alcoholism. 

Before she went to rehab, she would disappear, for days at a time, binge-drinking. Then she would go to family events and church as if nothing was going on. The weekend before she went to rehab, the family had plans to get together for a kind of late Mother's Day lunch. Instead of showing up, my SIL went out the night before and got completely wasted and was really sick the day of the lunch. She's a petite woman, so she gets *really* sick. A few days later she agreed to go to rehab. 

At this rehab facility, she is not allowed contact for 7 days. After that, she can have phone calls whenever and visitors on Sundays for a short period. 

**The situation that makes me question whether IATA.**

The other day, my son and I went to lunch with my MIL and GMIL. During lunch, they both told me that I have to bring my son to visit my SIL in rehab, because we ""need to show that we support her"", and because she ""misses *son's name* terribly"". They said that my SIL has been telling the other girls at this facility about how cute *her baby* is, and I need to bring him so that she can show him off. They also told me not to worry, because the place is a huge mansion and super secure, and no one is even allowed to bring bags in. (I'm not sure why this is supposed to make me feel more comfortable with the situation? I cant bring a diaper bag into a place that we will be for about 3 hours, so that's inconvenient, but that's okay).

Anyway, I had a bad taste about the whole thing and just kept telling them that I would talk to my husband (their son/grandson). 

When I got home, I told my husband everything that was said, and I also expressed to him the following: 

I'm not comfortable bringing my son to a rehab facility, even if it is ""safe"". I also kind of feel like they are using my son as a ""reward"" for her being in rehab.. I dont know how to explain it, but that's how I feel. They said that she misses him, and that she wants to see him, but my thing is.. if she had not gone out binge drinking, she could have seen him. 

I'm proud of her for agreeing to go into rehab, but she has only been there for a little over a week or so. Why should I let her see my son? She can see him when she gets out. 

I also feel uncomfortable because they said that she wants to ""show"" ""her baby"" off. 

Anyway, my husband agreed with me and said that he will visit her alone. He told his family this and they think we are both assholes because we are ""withholding"" our son from my SIL and ""giving the impression that we don't support her"".

bvz6kg	2019-06-02 16:30:02	name_not_important_2	AITA for voicing my negative opinions about religion to someone I know is religious?	"Background: I am an atheist. I have no problem with people who worship any god they believe in. My main problem is organized religion. I feel that people are using their religious beliefs to try and control the lives of everyone (for example, in regards to gay marriage, abortion, sex education, etc). Organized religion seems to intensify the need to force the way your religion tells you to live on everyone else. 

The story: I was eating lunch with some coworkers who are very religious when the subject of religion and atheism came up. One other person is an atheist like me, two are Christians, and one I am not sure of their beliefs. I try not to discuss religion at all (it just never ends well), but one of my coworkers specifically asked what my thoughts were. After telling her that I did not agree with her, and that she would not like what I had to say, I essentially said what I stated above after she said to continue. Of course the discussion went downhill from there. I did not include all of my negative thoughts on religion, and tried to keep it as PC as possible, but the two Christians became extremely upset. They basically said I was attacking their beliefs and their religion, when I was simply stating my own personal beliefs. I even said I have no problem with what they believe in, it’s only when they try and push those beliefs on other people (what I feel organized religion attempts to do). 

To try and end the argument I told them that it wasn’t fair for them to freely express their beliefs but then get mad when someone else did the same, simply because they don’t line up with their’s. Obviously the situation could have been handled better, but should I just not express my beliefs to someone I know will be offended? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvz5m0	2019-06-02 16:27:38	rollingschoolbag	AITA for telling my GF that her behaviour sometimes embarrasses me	"Told my GF that sometimes I'm uncomfortable or embarrassed by things she does.

She has an eating disorder and confidence/anxiety issues. Sometime she acts in a way that makes me cringe. 

Getting off the bus, there was a girl in her way with earphones in. After walking past/around her, she made a point of saying 'thanks for moving' and scowling at her.

We were chatting with a girl working in a restaurant, it was a bank holiday weekend. We were talking about the business  of the restaurant and she said 'Yes, for those in the hospitality industry this would be one of the busiest times'. Maybe this is me being too sensitive but I just felt the way she phrased this could make the worker think she was uppity or something?..

If someone asks her a question about something where a normal person would give a fairly short answer, she will ramble on about the topic, and the person is clearly thinking 'Wow, I was just expecting her to say ""Yeah I like chocolate too"", not explain the science of chocolate...'"	Asshole	0	0
bvz58h	2019-06-02 16:26:39		AITA for ditching a girl on a date because of football?	"I'm sure most of you know that the Champions League Final was played yesterday. Quite a boring match, but Liverpool were the winners. Kudos to them, they deserved it. Now being a Manchester United fan isn't nowadays, especially when we've had a pretty shit season and two of our main rivals have won both the domestic and European competitions. I have been going through a bad phase personally and professionally for a while now and honestly, this didn't help. So when this girl asked me out yesterday, I thought it'd be nice to relax and have a nice time.  
To clarify, we met at a mutual friends' party in Lyon a week back and casually hooked up that night. After that, we had been texting for a bit until she told me last night that she had moved to London temporarily for an internship, and is quite new to the city.

So, we decided to meet up at this bar in Soho. We started with some small talk, and after a couple of minutes, the topic of football came up, and she promptly said that she's a Liverpool fan. When I said who I support, she snorted into her drink and laughed quite loudly and condescendingly for a whole minute. A bit annoyed, I said that even though I support United, I did think Liverpool did very well to win the tournament. It did pain me to say this (the rivalry stretches quite deep) but she seemed like a nice woman and tbh I thought I'd give her the benefit of the doubt.

At this point, she went up a notch. She (almost) shouted at me saying that her team is a much better one, and my team is absolute shite. I tried to reason with her, to no avail. She then went on to criticize four or five individual players, saying that they're assholes who aren't even fit to lace Liverpool's boots. I was still calm.  
But then, she wondered loudly what I, a United fan, was doing in London and that 'most of you are plastic brown fucks'. Now I'm not 'brown' but that sentence pissed me off. Without saying a word, I stood up and went outside. It took me great restraint not to fuck off from the place right there. I stood outside and lit a smoke, and after a while, she came up and apologized, saying that she said things 'out of passion'. I said nothing and kept smoking. Then she for *some reason* got pissed off, saying that she hates 'you cocky fuckbois'. I said 'thanks', put out my cig and went back in. I paid for my drinks and was starting to leave while I heard her say behind me, 'wow you aren't even chivalrous, typical united fan.' To this, I couldn't control myself. I gave her the middle finger, said an expletive intended at her club (and her), called for a cab and left.

After this I've received a couple of texts which were basically a string of apologies, also mentioning that she thought I was 'hot' (WTF, really) and saying we should meet again this week. I'm not going to, of course. Man United and my dignity are **far** more important than some girl. Would love to hear opinions on this."	Not the A-hole	1	0

I decided to tell him off and let my boyfriend decide to do what he wanted with the situation. My boyfriend decided to just ignore it and move on. 

A few month later and they’re pals again, but now this ex-mutual friend is talking bad about me to my boyfriend and it really seems like he’s trying to come between us. I told my boyfriend what I though was happening and I said “I really don’t like you two being friends. Especially after everything that happened.” 

This “friend” has constantly been trying to disrupt our relationship and is overall a toxic person. 

I feel like I hurt my boyfriend when I said that I don’t like him being friends with him. But I really am concerned about this “friend” damaging our relationship.

bvz3iw	2019-06-02 16:22:21	vnssyl	AITA for being upset with my [16F] mom [56F] over Christmas/birthday gifts?	"I really enjoy cooking/baking and I frequently make simple dinners/bread/muffins/cookies etc for my family, and I occasionally make something a bit more complex when I find the time or for special occasions. For the past couple years, I've asked for some relatively costly equipment to make my cooking easier and so every year my parents combine my birthday present with my Christmas present. So far I've gotten an electric handmixer, a dehydrator, and an electronic kitchen scale. I've been really happy about these gifts (I no longer need to beat eggs by hand lol) and grateful to my parents for supporting my hobby. 

My parents immigrated from rural China to Canada, so they always point out how well off we are now compared to how they grew up and constantly reminding me how much worse things could've been. They (specifically my mom) always hold these gifts over my head, telling me that it cost them a fortune and have used this to limit me from going out with friends, going on school trips, buying new clothes or shoes, and sometimes they guilt me into cooking for them even when I have a lot of homework to do. I usually just comply with their demands because hey, they bought me a dehydrator. 

Recently, I was trying to show my mom how to create a group chat in WeChat and I came across a group with my aunts and uncles. In it, my mom was bragging about how my next present was going to be a waffle maker. I was excited, and I'll admit I snooped a bit to see the specs. However, I soon discovered that all my presents were actually from one of my mom's friend, who had moved back to China a couple years ago and had given my mom all her kitchenware and appliances for free. She had been stockpiling the items in our basement, and ""gifting"" me one each year.. 

I confronted her and she just berated me for being an ungrateful brat and basically kicked me out. I know she'll let me back in by the time it gets dark, but for now I'm at the library. My phone is blowing up with other family members calling me ungrateful and some other nastier stuff, and my friends are split on this topic. AITA?

TLDR: My mom has been giving me gifts that she got for free but claims she spent a fortune on them to manipulate me.

EDIT: I have a big math test soon so I won't be able to respond to every comment, but I want to be clear that I loved the gifts and I will always love them. I understand that times are tough, and so their origin doesn't matter very much to me. I am upset about the fact that she has been lying and manipulating me. I do appreciate all the perspectives that are being given.

EDIT 2: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, and I'll try my best to respond to each comment but Im really grateful for all the support  I've recieved over the past day and again, I appreciate all feedback.

EDIT 3: Sorry for all the edits lol but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for being unclear in my original post, I was upset at the time and wasn't thinking too clearly but hopefully my first edit cleared things up"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My mom has gone back to school (I'm proud of her btw) and for the last few weeks she has been interning. Her study is almost done, the only thing she has to do is write 3 essays of some sort. The other day she asked me if I could help so I said sure, then she told me I only have to write one of the essays. ""You're sooo good at writing essays you can do this for me right?"" Those were her words translated. So I said ""nahh I can help, but i won't write the whole essay""

Well today my sister is at our home and my mom told her ""abbywabby won't even help me with my essays"" so my sister asked my why I won't help so I told her I'm not going to write a whole essay. My sister said I should just suck it up and help her the way she asks me to and not ask too many questions as she is my mother and she cooks for me so you know just do it. 

I still don't want to write an essay for my mom, because it's her own study. And eventhough I'm in university, my essay writing skills aren't necessarily the best (I know how to get a good grade for my subjects but that's it).

bvz20j	2019-06-02 16:18:32	bananablep	AITA for not being able to help my best friend through depression?	"My best friend (22F) and I (22F) have known each other since we were 8 years old and we can honestly say we know each other better than almost anyone else does. We grew up with very different personalities - she was very sensitive, easily offended and took everything personally, while I was more blunt and careless with my words. Today, I'd say I'm still the same, but a series of bad relationships (for lack of a better word) with boys who always wanted more/someone/something else, unsupportive parents and constantly being made to feel like she is not good enough, has made her a very insecure person. She is constantly looking for validation from the wrong people, gets very caught up with anyone who gives her attention, and has no will or motivation to fix things in her life that are going wrong (she has developed a number of health issues due to neglect, and her ongoing depression has given her the tendency to self sabotage at every opportunity). 

As her best friend, she confides in me and tells me everything that is going on in her life and while I try to be as understanding, empathetic and patient as I can, I can't help but be honest with her sometimes and tell her she's making things worse for herself. One such time recently, I exploded at her after having to validate an insecurity she has that has resurfaced strongly lately, and told her that I can't keep parroting the same validation back to her when she refuses to do anything about it. Not only is it awful to have to see her go through these things and constantly make choices (in relationships, substance abuse habits, etc) that are detrimental, but it's exhausting to have to keep telling her she's doing okay and it gets better, when she refuses to do anything about it. Anytime I try to offer a solution (I usually stick with listening and giving her the responses I know she wants) she cuts me off and claims I don't understand and I'm hurtful. 

Am I the asshole for not having enough patience to deal with her and not giving her the response she wants everytime?

(EDIT: I didn't mention that she does get professional help and has seen a bunch of therapists. She refuses to be consistent with any medication and has turned down pretty much any suggestions she's gotten from professionals. It seems like she doesn't want to help herself and I don't understand it. Apathy is a part of depression, but to what extent?)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Apparently my ""dear"" uncle originally wanted his son to speak but his location as been unknown to everyone for years now. Now it falls on me as backup since I am the only other male in my immediate family and my dead uncle specifically wants his son or me to speak on his behalf.

I told my aunts straight away no and they are upset simply because I should pay respects to a man who was a complete prick in life simply because he served in the military.

The man was a drunk who terrorized his own two kids so much they rather pretend they don't have a father, he was horrible to his own dying wife, during his mother's funeral he arrived drunk , cursing out his sisters and in general just treated women around him lower than dogs. He had a serious superiority complex and go on fits of rage and threats of violence towards anyone that dared challenged his ego.

He was verbally and mentally abuse and was that way till the day he left earth. As far as I'm concerned he couldn't have left soon enough. But apparently my family knows all this, they grew up with this behavior, and yet still they feel like I should pay my respects simply because he was my uncle and the fact he was a general. 

Regardless of what he was during his time in the army, I feel I shouldn't be obligated to just pretend he was decent guy just because he's dead now. I refuse to get up on that podium, smile and just pretend the man wasn't a true asshole in life. I feel cold saying it, but yes I am happy the man is gone. 

Lastly, I'm tired of my family throwing the fact he was a General in my face to convince me. I keep telling them  I don't care how many medals he's earned, I wouldn't care if he had the highest honor, respect is given. The man never showed it to anyone and therefore I feel I shouldn't show it to him."	Not the A-hole	0	0

This story is told from my brother’s perspective (Le Asshole) 

Alright so a few days ago I took the MOST MASSIVE Dump ever recorded in my house, like the holy grail of shits.. so obviously it clogged the family toilet BIG TIME. Now I didn’t bother to flush- because that’s what losers do. So I left the bathroom and went to my room (which is only a foot away from the bathroom) and got on my gaming computer to play with my buddies. 

Now my sister (Op) had just gotten home around 5 (I came home around 3) so the Holy grail of shit [HGS] was still in the toilet, sitting and soaking. My sister goes into the bathroom to do her business but can’t because of the HGS  so she goes over to my door and it goes like this-

S: sister (op)

B: Brother (aka asshole) 

S: “hey dude you need to unclog the toilet” this was said in a calm tone

B: glares at S and walks over to door and slams it in S’s face

So that was like a week ago A FLIPPING WEEK AGO

S continues to badger him and mother to try to fix the toilet so it is usable again. 

The toilet remains unclogged to this day

TLDR brother clogs the toilet with massive shit and refuses to unclog it

I met my ex-wife around 9 yrs ago, when her son was 4 mos old. We got married 2 yrs later and he has called me Dad his ever since. My daughter was born 2 yrs into our marriage, when he was 4 (just keeping continuity in the story here). I taught him how to ride dirt bikes, skateboard, and of course be a competent gamer lol. He was my son.

We had just finished building a house and moved in about 8 mos ago. We had lived in the house for a month and that's when my ex-wife told me she planned on showing horses with this family she had met last year, it seemed strange but ok. The first time, my stepson went, who also loves showing horses, and I'll never forget what he said to me a couple days after their trip. ""Dad, is it ok for another woman to talk and hug another man if she is married?"". I didn't know what to say to this other than, ""Sure, adults have friends and they talk and hug"". I didn't confront her about this, as she told me she earlier they were doing several more horse shows.

The last weekend she came back, she said she wanted a divorce. That's when I asked her about my stepson told me. She got absolutely furious and stormed out and said she needed time.

I think she must have started to think that I was going to turn her son against her, because her disposition changed.

During the divorce several times she stated that I don't get custody and I can only see my stepson if she lets me. Another 2 mos went by, I was trying to find ways to get close to each of my kids but it was proving hard. SO, I had found a couple of local events going on, the first for my daughter and the second being my step-son. When I asked my ex-wife if she could keep my stepson, she threw an absolute fit and said she wanted all his belongings (this house was already sold and I was renting a 3bdr in town). Thankfully, I talked her over it and she didn’t take his stuff.

About 3 mo. ago, my stepson told me that I wouldn't be his stepdad anymore...out of nowhere. I told him yes, but “I'll always be your dad and I will always love you”. For some reason, he felt compelled to argue: ""yeah, but you don't get any custody”. I knew for sure someone had told him that, and when I asked my ex-wife she threw another fit and said she didn't say that to him. Something changed with his disposition, he started not listening to me and then several times told me I'm not his dad...At this point I didn't know what to do and was starting to question whether or not my stepson wanted to be with me at all. Then my ex-wife finally told me she wanted all of his things and I obliged, as I saw this coming. 

AITA for not trying harder to keep my stepson in my life? At this point (3 months not seeing him and enrolled in another school 70 mi. away), I have written-off any possibility of having him back in my family. I now have no way of contacting him at all and wonder if I should have made better choices.

EDIT 1: We have joint custody of my daughter. I did hire a lawyer and tried to get her to let me adopt him b4 finalizing the divorce, but she didnt want to strip his bio dads rights (even tho he pays no child support and has no license or vehicle)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My parents divorced and my dad and the neighbor moved out and started a family. They got married and have 2 kids together. Me and my sister stayed with our mom in the house we grew up in. 

The split was really bad for my and my mom's mental health. I still to this day have to take antidepressants to function and my mom is not much better. It's been around 5 years and my mom is still not over the divorce. Any time I go over, she asks how the ex-neighbor is, if she's fat, if she's ugly, etc. She says it's ok if me and my sister go over any time, but then acts kinda bitchy after we come back home, asking about every little thing we did at dad's place. It sould also be noted that because of school and health I only visit once every few months. 

Now I really like visiting them. I love seeing my little half-brothers and I like spending time with my dad, and I even get along with the ex-neighbor. I've gotten over the divorce, and I've gotten over the anger and disappointment I felt initially, but I don't think my mom has.

Last night around 4AM my girlfriend got home from going out with two of her friends. At this point in time I had already been asleep for 2-3 hours in our bedroom. I woke up to them all in our room with the hallway light on staring and laughing at me. I told them to get out, close the door, and turn off the lights, which they did.

They then preceded to go to her office across the hall, leaving the door open and talking in there. I laid in bed for about 5 minutes before I got up and told them to please be quiet because I could hear their entire conversation.

From there they went downstairs and continued to talk loud as fuck and generally be fucking annoying (I’m fairly salty, can you tell?). At this point I am fuming. I waited about 10 minutes and went downstairs and told them to either quiet the fuck down or leave. I was very aggressive in the way I said it but I was at the end of my rope.

Background:

My father left my family when I was very young, but we would still talk on the phone. He moved across the country, and I still looked forward to talking to him. He came back to visit a few times for father's day. I now realize these visits were just manipulative on his part. However, I never saw him for a looong time after around second grade. 

He got my hopes up a lot and I after that I never really wanted to see him again. Of course, the time that I didn't want to see him most was when he decided to move back to where my family and I live. I did not want to see him at all. 

I never invited him to any of my banquets for sports, or any honors nights. I did not want to talk to him or see him at all. Not only did he abandon me and put false hope in me for over 10 years, he had let me down way too many times. He had missed his chance, and now I do have a stepdad that I prefer. It became extremely embarrassing, as he would contact teachers that ran certain events that I was in, and would ask for times that I would be there, so he could show up. The teachers would have to pull me aside and ask if I would want them to give away that information to him. I would say no. 

This continued for a while, until about a week ago. There was a final Honors night to honor the top graduates in our graduating class. I am among the top students, and was recognized. The night went very well, and I had fun at the ceremony. I was taking pictures with friends and other family members, until I saw him. It instantly made my smile go away. I did not want to talk to anyone after that, I just wanted to go home. I don't know how he even got the information for the honors night, and definitely did not want to see him. If I wanted him there, I would have invited him. I never invited him. I tried my best to avoid eye contact, but he stared at me and asked if I had a graduation ticket for him. I had not spoken to him in nearly 2 years. I said no. I really didn't. I gave my tickets (5 that the school gave me), to the people that I actually want to be there. He continued to just stare at me until I walked away from him. It was practically a nightmare. Maybe closer to sleep paralysis. I honestly do not intend on speaking to him ever again.

I thought that was the end of the situation. However, when I got home from bawling in the car with my mom and stepdad, I received an Instagram message from some 50 year old woman. I have no idea who she is. She says that she is my father's friend and she is so disappointed in me. She asks why I didn't invite him to my graduation. She genuinely asked ""Do you just hate him and want to make him suffer?"". I never responded to her message.

It has come to the point where if I even think about my father, I can instantly start crying. The situation practically ruins me, as I feel guilty, but I just do not want him in my life.

bvyso5	2019-06-02 15:55:20		WIBTA if we asked a pro gamer to stop playing with us?	"Let me start out by saying they're not officially 'pro', but pretty much as close to pro as it gets. I won't say the name of the game, but it's a VERY small community of players and we only get a few handfuls of new players every day. 

Basically, this guy is just too good and plays constantly. Almost 100% of the time he's topping the runner up by almost double the kills. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if he was only doing this with only veteran players. No, he joins the 'quick play', aka the newbies who just downloaded the game. He then proceeds to slaughter them, which leads the new players to quit because who wants to constantly be killed? We suspect he's doing this because he wants to be at the top of the leaderboard, regardless of how he gets there. (Also, we're not sure if he's using an aimbot or not. We can't tell if he's just that good, or he's cheating. Seriously, this guy is insane.)

I promise this isn't just us being salty. We're all just trying to have fun! However, when we're trying to create a game and all the players online are logging off because the 'pro' keeps destroying them, it's starting to become a problem. 

So, would we be assholes if we told the guy to take a break every once in a while? To stop constantly playing only with the newcomers?"		1	0
bvys6m	2019-06-02 15:54:05	ugly_bitch_	WIBTA for saying something to a parent who brought their nonverbal child on the quiet car of the train?	"I’m sitting in the quiet car of the train right now and I was trying to get some sleep like I’m sure most other people were. We made a stop and someone got in with an older child who is clearly nonverbal for whatever reason (I cannot see the duo but I can hear the interactions). The child is making a lot of very loud moaning/cat like sounds. This bothered me a little bit because while I understand the quiet car may make things a little bit easier for the child, the child is one person out of 40 people in the car and he is the only one making (very loud) noise. The other cars aren’t even loud so I don’t see the need for him to be in the quiet car where people specifically came to be quiet and be around quietness. I was bothered enough by the moaning noise but now the mother (I think) has played music for him or a video for him without headphones on two occasions. It only lasts for about 10 seconds, but it’s just annoying me because again this is the quiet car. And it’s not like she doesn’t know this is the quiet car, there are signs everywhere and the conductor tells you before you get on the train. I don’t want to be rude about it because I understand that the mother is in a difficult situation and I do empathize with her, however I just don’t think it was appropriate for her to bring her child into the quiet car knowing that he wouldn’t be quiet.  I just want to tell her that maybe next time she could consider another car because all the other cars are generally quiet but the difference is you can make noise without people feeling really annoyed. Idk I probably won’t say anything either way but WIBTA?

Update: 

First I just wanted to thank y’all for your input. I didn’t end up saying anything to the mom or handing her a note or anything. I was highly considering going the note route but at the end of the day I figured she had her reasons for being in there and I didn’t want to be the catalyst to something negative. Several people mentioned saying something to the conductor but unlike some people are thinking, I’m not an evil person and I didn’t want to have to make them move because undoubtedly that would have upset the child even more. I am considering contacting the train network and letting them know what happened, maybe they’ll be stricter about noise in the future or hopefully they’ll be able to make more accommodations for special needs people! 

I think the main point some people are missing is that it’s a quiet car and everyone in there has a situation that leads them to sit in the quiet car. I might not be special needs but like I mentioned in some comments, my situation is that earplugs/headphones give me really bad headaches and I choose to sit in the quiet car so I won’t come upon a scenario in which I will have to use them because...who wants a headache that lasts all day? The point of the quiet car is for it to actually be quiet, people are not allowed to bring screaming babies in there unless they are just passing through, people are not allowed to play videos which the mom was doing, people are not allowed to be talking to the person next to them, it’s just not allowed because it is supposed to be a safe haven for the people that need quiet."

Also, english isn't my native english, but here we go:

So, I am a father of two. A boy and a girl, both teenagers. And I started turning our internet modem and wi-fi router off after 10PM to forcedly make them go to bed. They are very annoyed by this and say that I am being too harsh on them and that I am having a coercive behaviour (These are their exact words... Teenagers, right?). But after I figured out they were getting late to school (I have to go to work earlier), probably because they spent the whole night on their phones instead of sleeping I figured I had to do something about it. AITA? What could I be doing differently?

Edit1: Just making things clearer:

- I was not completely sure they were staying up late because of the internet. But as mentioned in the comments, when they started complaining about it, they kind of sold themselves out. hehe
- About ""Teenagers, right? Think they're so smart haha"": I'm sorry, I didn't looked down upon them in the moment of our discussion. I said it just here and meant it as a joke.
- We do not have LTE as well. Too expensive in my country.
- They do their homework in school most of the times. When they arrive at home their only duties are to help me with our daily house chores. 
- And it's not like they're bad students or failing classes, their grades are good. And they're great kids."	No A-holes here	0	0
bvyrdc	2019-06-02 15:51:51	happymommaoftwo	AITA for planning to ban my daughter from all the nerdy but inappropriate stuff she likes?	"So, I have a 16y/o daughter, and a 3y/o son. Before my daughter went to secondary school, she was into pretty normal stuff for a teenage girl, but after making new friends, she got into very geeky stuff. My husband enjoys movies, so she has always been into those, but she was suddenly deep into 'fandoms' and stuff. Nowadays, she 'cosplays' (dresses up as fictional characters for fun), has covered her room in posters and pictures of bands and animes and things, and plays violent video games. As I type this, she is in her room playing 'Rainbow Six Siege' with her friends, screaming at them down the mic, while listening to a band called 'Ice Nine Kills', who scream a lot, and have violent videos based on horror movies. Before my son was born, I didn't mind all of this, but I don't want him to grow up around all this violent imagery and to be like her. 

My problem with this began when she bought a hoodie that she told me was just anime faces. But when I got the email for what she ordered, it was a 'ahegao' hoodie, which is sexual. She then put my son in this hoodie, and posted photos on social media.

I want to ban this type of thing, and remove it from our household, but don't know if it would be too horrible on her."	Asshole	0	0

bvym0t	2019-06-02 15:38:02	obviousthrowaway3928	AITA for feeling jealous of my BF in our shared artistic pursuits?	"My BF and I are both in our mid 20's, both dabble in art and writing as serious hobbies. He is more focused in illustration, me in writing, but for the most part, we mutually support each other's pursuits.

Recently, BF decided he wants to write a novel and get published. I have been struggling to produce anything of value since graduating due to mental health issues and now the increasing need to work myself to death to support us both, because he's disabled and can't get a job. Finding time to write anything, much less multiple drafts of compelling prose, has been difficult.

I feel like an ass for being intensely jealous that he can waltz in here and tell me he's going to finish a novel and get published when I don't have the luxury of sitting around all day working on my drafts. I'm supposed to support him and feel good for him and I just can't. It hurts to think he will achieve my dream before me and then get to condescend to me about how I'm working at my own pace and I'll get there someday and he's rooting for me. Fuck that.

The real kicker is, he's not good. He's an objectively awful writer. Artistic value can be subjective, sure, but there is a certain level of craft required for good writing. His writing is amateur hour and I have supported him through it because, before this, we were just collaborating on fanfiction.

And even on AO3, his work has consistently gotten more views and more response than mine, when his is barely readable schlock porn with no substance and even less sense. Because of his weirdly magnetic ability to get what he wants and his already proven success, I feel like he will somehow manage to get published. 

It kills me to think he will achieve my dream before me and he won't have worked a fraction as hard for it. This is my B.A. I'm already facing the necessity of giving up on an MFA because by the time we have enough stability and money for me to go back to a writer's workshop program, I'll probably be in my 40s or 50s. And I feel this incredible resentment that he's going to breeze in here and achieve the thing I've been working so hard to do, and to add insult to injury, he'll do it with garbage. I don't know what to do to calm the insane jealousy and anger and just support him like I'm supposed to."	Asshole	0	0

bvyl26	2019-06-02 15:35:31	curious-user-	AITA for not watching my roommates kid?	"Basically, my roommate has a two year old. Overall he’s a great guy and generally takes great care of his daughter. She’s at our place half the time, and the other half is at her moms. Overall, she’s very well behaved. However, I’ve made it very clear I don’t want to be responsible for watching his kid. It’s not that I don’t like children, it’s more about responsibility if I’m watching her and something goes wrong. 

My roommate works two jobs, and to be honest he works his ass off trying to provide and be a good father. Recently, he has started asking me to watch her while he away at work. I’ve told him I’m not comfortable watching her and out of courtesy I let him get away with leaving for an hour or two. 

About a week ago, I arrived home from work after a significant amount of overtime. He asked me to watch her for a couple hours while he ran out for some postmates runs. I said no a couple times, and reluctantly agreed to watch her because I was sympathetic. 

Two hours turned into well over three and passed her bed time. She was being a brat (probably really sleepy) so I took her to the crib and hung out with her for another thirty minutes until she was asleep. I went back downstairs to my couch and fell asleep watching a movie. I don’t know the time frame but I heard her screaming at the top of her lungs and pulled myself out sleep to check on her. She somehow managed to climb out of the crib and walk through the baby gate id accidentally left open. 

She fell down the stairs and was holding her head with a little bruise. I was panicked and took her straight to the hospital while calling my roommate over and over. He never picked up. Fortunately, the hospital is only five minutes from my house so we arrived quickly. I threw all the medical expenses on my credit card - she had broken finger and few bruises. 

I frantically called his ex, who also didn’t answer. Guess where they both were - fucking together. I told them what happened and apologized repetitively. We got into a massive fight - leading to me telling both of them they were terrible parents and I wasn’t paying for a fucking thing. Friday, I found he and his ex filed a complaint with our landlord for negligence or some shit on my part for falling asleep while watching the kid and are going to dispute the hospital charge with the court. 

This has spiraled out of control quickly. I’m going to speak to my family attorney later today. I can’t help but feel like an asshole, but I’m not the damn parent."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvyknw	2019-06-02 15:34:30	xtceyzz	WIBTA for calling out my sister for inviting someone else on our vacation?	"So, my husband and I (33f) are going on vacation with my sister (29f), BIL, and 3 kids (all under 10). We're getting a 2-bedroom 2-bath condo (kids will sleep on pull-out couch. I HAD to have my own bathroom). We agreed to pay for the trip 50/50. 

Last night sister sent a text to me saying they've invited BIL's mom to come because she's ""stressed out"" and needs a vacation. Yeah, welcome to the club. 

I feel like they shouldn't have invited her without asking us first. Second, I feel like my husband and I paying for half a trip when we're now 2 out of 8 people is kind of ridiculous.

bvykfq	2019-06-02 15:33:58	clueless-duck	AITA for asking my parents if I can be more independent?	"Okay, so, before I tell you what happened, I will need to tell you something about my family before you judge me or my parents: my family is very traditional and very religious. Meaning, we naturally live a very strict life.

As for me, I'm neither religious or strictly traditional. In other words, I'm secretly non-religious but use some traditional and religious morals as a foundation for my beliefs and morals.

&#x200B;

Anyways, yesterday, me and my parents started talking about random subjects with our honest opinion on it while we are eating dinner. And eventually, it devolved into how I find them to be a little clingy. They asked me why I feel that way and I said:

""literally every time I go to college or go out of town to get something, you always call me every 15 minutes asking me if I was okay or not. each. Plus, you always ask me about where exactly I am and what am I doing at the time.""

&#x200B;

After I said that, they told me how it's not what I think and how this is just them being considerate and caring and how it's their duty as parents to always take care of their kids no matter how old they are. (keep in mind that I'm 18 )

Then, I told them that I don't have a problem with them caring about me (because I deeply appreciate it) but the way they express it. I didn't say that to them but I honestly feel... chocked and stripped of my adulthood (or any chance of having it) with that behavior.

&#x200B;

We kept talking about it for a while and what I came up with is that my parents are just, according to them, ""following the Book"" and just trying their best. Which, by the way, I can completely understand but... I don't know. Maybe I'm the asshole. maybe I'm the Alien for how odd I am Because, as far as I know, I'm the only one how is like this in my family. Maybe there is something wrong with me. I even considered secretly visiting a psychiatrist.

I know that may sound like too much but I had a conversation with my sister the other day about death. And when I said my opinion, she called me ""Sentimentaless"" because I thought that death is something that happens to everyone and it's pointless, yet understandable, to feel emotional over someone and everyone should accept that fate.

Though maybe I was a little blunt with that opinion, it didn't stop me from thinking that I might be a little psychopathic or something after the conversation with my parents. whether this is true or not.

&#x200B;

That's all I got to say for now. I have never been so conflicted and it is absolutely tearing me. In fact, it was really hard for me to write this.

If you got any questions, please be patient as I'm currently studying and generally preparing myself for what's to come, whether it is the exam, the judgment from here, or anything else.

My inner self was telling to wait until I'm ready but fuck it, I'm ready for anything you give me at this point.

So, AITA?

My husband works for a very small local company For three years, that puts out a craft product. It is an industrial job, and he is the lead employee under the owner. 

Today he let me know he re-wired a section of his production line because part of it needed to be replaced. He is not an electrician and has never received any formal training. I asked first, how is it safe, and second, how is it his job to do electrical wiring?

He became upset and let me know that part of his job is maintenance On his production line. He listed off about six different things that he does that have absolutely nothing to do with his actual job title, Including the following. 

“Electricity, plumbing, hvac, insulation laying, glycol running and the proper understanding of pressurized liquid moving through pipes, pressurized gas handling, welding. Soldering, the list goes on.“

He does not get any benefits outside of his pay. No health insurance, no hazard pay, nothing. He sent me a picture of himself wearing a filter mask last week, celebrating that the owner finally bought one. He does not get any benefits outside of his pay. No health insurance, no hazard pay, nothing. He sent me a picture of himself wearing a filter mask last week, celebrating that the owner finally bought one for him. 

I have had to take him to the hospital for a face blast of steam that burned his eyes, he comes home covered in bruises and cuts all the time.

And when I didn’t support or congratulate him on rewiring his production line today, he became very angry with me. He told me that when a volcanologist gets near lavash, other volcanologists don’t chide him for putting himself in danger. He told me I should be proud of him for being able to accomplish so much without training rather than worried that he will get hurt or killed. He told me that I was living in fake fear and no different than anti-VAXer. 

I apologized for my stupidity and told him how proud I was. I basically said it to stop being attacked.

"I was browsing my NSFW account on Reddit last week when I saw someone who looked VERY familiar on petitegonewild. I went to her post history, and sure enough, it was a girl that sat in my calculus class all year. I went to my best friend and made him SWEAR to not tell anyone (he was also in the same class, and I wanted to confirm it was her). He swore, and I sent him the link and asked if it was really her. We confirmed it *definitely* was. I browsed her profile and spanked it before going about my day.

&#x200B;

Come the next day, she didn't show up to class. I found out at around lunch that ""someone"" leaked her profile, and it went ALL around the school. People were being cruel; saying how much of a slut she was, asking if they could fuck because she's obviously easy, just really mean things.

She didn't end up going to school all week, and I'm worried for her because we had a calc final on Friday. I feel kinda bad because I'm 60% sure the ""someone"" who leaked it was my friend. But at the same time, the post had thousands of upvotes and clearly showed her face (with a caption of something like ""first time I've ever showed face"" or something like that). The rest of her profile didn't show her face, but they were still pretty identifying. My friend is a pretty trustworthy guy, so it honestly might've been anybody.

    For some background information, the rejected is my ex boyfriend. We first got together too quickly after I got out of a bad relationship but we broke up soon after. He got a new girlfriend and I nice girl’d that badly but that’s a whole other story. We did end up back together in January and were together for three months. I ended up leaving for someone else where I know I’m the asshole for but this is a different situation and he’s not that important here. I gave up on both choices and took a friend’s advice to work on loving myself because if I can’t commit to myself I can’t commit to anyone else.
    Now for the story: I ended up crushing on my friend who told me to work on myself because for a while I was spiraling from some bad events that bummed me out but he offered to spend time with me and even cuddled me while letting me vent out my feelings to him. I’ve known him for four years and have liked him on and off for years. We don’t talk as often anymore but he’s still really dear to me so when we reconnected I started crushing on him. I don’t plan on pursuing him because I know that he likes a different girl but also doesn’t plan on dating someone until after undergrad unless he really thinks the relationship is worth it. I respect that but I still like him to the point I don’t want to date someone else.
    I thought that working on my self-care was the best way to start getting over him and it’s helping me love myself but it’s making my ex upset. My ex knows I don’t feel the same way anymore but I know he still loves me, but I’m not looking to be with anyone as I feel like I’m not really on the same page as people who like me. I’m still working on myself and I don’t plan on dating anyone until I feel like I love myself enough to be with another person but I see my ex shaking and being noticeably upset by my previous and present actions. I’m told by friends that they miss me being with him because of how lovey and cute we were but I don’t miss it because I found it more playful than serious. I do find my ex very attractive and his sweetness gets to me at times but overall, I don’t want him the way he wants me.
    I feel like a hypocrite because if my friend liked me back I’d want to work on loving myself while being with him; however, when it comes to my ex, I feel like I’d just be the asshole in our relationship a lot because he’s too sweet and caring to ever fight while I’m still very prideful and stubborn with a bad temper. I want to find someone serious who can help soften some of my edges and help me be a better person or stick to being single until I can be a better self. AITA for being a hypocrite?"

bvyfsy	2019-06-02 15:21:42		AITA for the way I responded to my boss calling me off from work	"So some background, I work by at a pool snack bar and sometimes people get called off for bad weather (which is understandable). This is my second year there, everyone that works there are college students that work there in the summer. 

The problem I have is that the way my boss decides to cut people is very unfair in my eyes. 

So for the past week I have gone home 2 times but both times I volenteered when she said someone has to go home early. This is because both times were on a Saturday, and I would rather be sent home/called off on a Saturday than any other day. So I volenteered to go home early so I didnt had a pass the next time my boss was sending people home. 

This morning while I was relaxing away from my phone, my boss texts the 4 people working tonight, ""I need 3 people to work tonight, whoever texts back first gets it"" since I was away from my phone I was the odd one out. 

Now I am a little upset for 2 reasons, 1. I have gone home early twice (more than the other people on the shift) and 2. I dont like how she did it being unfair without taking everything into account. 

I then proceed to text my boss this: ""So now I have to be glued to my phone to get shifts I'm scheduled for now?""

My boss responds that that was the most fair way to do it since it's not nice out and claiming I had more hours than the other (when 2 of the others had the same amount as me)

I responded saying that I did not have more shifts  and that I have gone home more times than each of them. 

My boss responded saying that since I volenteered (when she was sending people home) to go home when she asked that it was up to me that I went home early (when I know that sometimes you go home early, it happens to everyone so I want to be smart with the days I am sent home early). 

I responded: ""Yesterday I knew you were gonna send someone home, and the past Saturday you said someone has to go home. I only offer because I would rather go home early on a Saturday than any other day of the week. I know I'm eventually gonna have to go home early so I try to do it on days I want to do something than days I would be rather working. I'm planning for the future.""

My boss responded saying she didnt get why I was upset 

Then I finally responded: ""Because I've paid my dues in preparation of days like these""
""I would rather be called off by you saying we dont need you, than my a dibs system""
""There should be a list of hours each person has missed from scheduled shifts, and the person who has the least amount should go home, that's the fair way, not by a system of dibs""

And that's the end of it

It's worth noting that this has been done in the past, and my boss has also sent people home by pulling straws. 

I just think that it would be more fair to everyone if the list suggestion was implemented rather than games of chance.

bvyf5a	2019-06-02 15:19:57		AITA for being angry at my BF for letting me go home alone after dinner with his family.	"So, bf is (21M) and I'm (20F). 

My boyfriend chatted me to catch up to their family dinner today because his family invited me and I agreed, so I went there alone, because he went ahead and left me, even though we live in the same dorm...

After dinner, he made his sister, the sister's bf, and his cousin drop me off back to the dorm, because he was going back home (in a different car with the rest of his family), I asked him to go back to the dorm with me and just go home the next day because I am uncomfortable being left alone with his sister, whom I MOST uncomfortable with and the sister's bf. I offered to pay the expenses for his commute the next day but he refused. I wanted to just get a ride back home alone but that would make me look rude or aloof.

A little context, their family dynamic is something I'm not used to which makes me more anxious and shy with them because they don't speak to each other. They speak one-liners most of the time and only when spoken to. They don't even acknowledge each other's presence upon arrival. They just really don't talk. I found this odd because my family normally greets each other atleast but that's their dynamic anyway (only his direct family and not his other relatives who are social enough, and I'm guessing probably the ones who asked to make me come over dinner)

This makes me uncomfortable being alone with them because he is not close with his siblings, which makes it more awkward for me to speak with them as I am an outsider. I told him over chat about what I felt, and he got mad at me and that I was acting like a baby, and now refuses to reply.

bvycys	2019-06-02 15:14:09	catanddog5	AITA: I had an argument with my fiancé when he did something nice for our neighbor whom we had a major falling out with. I told him that he might make the situation worse but he did it anyways. It wound up being ok but I rather have him not interact with our neighbor at all.	"So our falling out started almost a year ago when my fiancé fired our neighbor for not be a good labor. This was the usual issue but neighbor’s feelings got hurt this time. 

My fiancé tried to apologize but it wasn’t accepted. We had to call the cops several times due to him threatening my fiancé several times before things finally cooled off. 

My neighbor is also a recovering drug addict. We suspected that he relapsed when he was harassing us. The last few months he seems clean. He got a car and a dog. 

One day my fiancé noticed that the neighbor left his trunk open before we went out and wanted to let him know so the battery didn’t die. At this point things have been awkwardly civil between us but I insisted that he just leave it. I forgot something in the house and went back. 

While I was inside my fiancé knocked on our neighbor’s door to let him know about his open trunk. When I get back to the car my fiancé admitted to doing it anyways. 

We both understand that it is not always easy to quit when addicted. My fiancé continues to try to be nice to our neighbor while I don’t want to do anything with our neighbor anymore.

bvycub	2019-06-02 15:13:48	proactive-defense	AITA for giving my friend the silent treatment?	"So I’m giving my friend the silent treatment. And I feel really bad about it. Because I don’t want to hurt them, I honestly just want to give them a hug and say sorry for that. But I’m conflicted because of principle.

Well here’s the situation. We’ve been friends for a year and a half. We’re in the same club and we carpool together frequently just the two of us and we live in the same college. When we’re alone she’s all chummy and quite close with me. But if there’s literally anyone else around she will *abandon* me in favour of them. She never initiates conversation at meal times, never messages me first, never asks to hang out.

So I’m feeling a very heavy lack of investment from her. So just as an experiment, I just didn’t say a word during the last 4 carpool trips. And she has made no effort to fill the silence. She just accepted the rapport break and went with it. And I can tell it hurts for her. But she hasn’t asked why I’m not initiating conversation. And I’m not ignoring her either I’m just not *initiating*. 

It just hurts because I think this friendship is going to die, and it’s going to hurt both of us. I don’t want a lose-lose situation like that. I like her, I’m not mad, I just want reciprocation, and I’m trying to covertly communicate that I want reciprocation by reciprocating her low effort back to her, indicating that if she gave some energy I would reciprocate that as well.

I guess what I’m holding out for is for her to ask me what’s up, because that would indicate that she actually cares. But maybe I should just tell her that I’m not cool with her low effort, that she doesn’t talk to me when other people are around because she thinks she’s too cool for me or something. 

But why do I have to do all the work here? I want to be friends with people who want to be friends with me. I want 50/50 investment. I feel principally justified in abruptly making my level of investment equal to hers. I was carrying this whole friendship on my shoulders. It shouldn’t be like that.

When I was getting a new one drawn up I was invited them over for dinner. Now I left them home alone while I went for groceries and the nephew was at a sleepover. The only way they could know is if they went into my office and saw the list I made of what I want to go to who. When I was gonna see the guy in a few days. Thing is that list was incomplete, I hadn’t added them yet. Basically I had given 1mil to each sibling except my sister where I was still debating giving them less or not because I was gonna give nephew 100k to be given to him at 18. I was honestly gonna add my sister for 1mil as well but now I am second guessing that because of her actions.

bvy9r4	2019-06-02 15:05:42	Wjolnir	AITA for expecting the girl I'm dating to offer help cleaning after I cook dinner.	"We're both mid 30s, less than 6 months post divorce, and have been dating for 6 weeks. We see each other 2-3x per week and usually alternate whose house we go to. When we go to her house, we typically go out for food since she's in the process of moving so she's never cooked for me before. I've made dinner for her 4x at my place, not huge productions but I am a damn good cook so I don't mind cooking for other people.

The issue came about after dinner, she had not offered to help me clean up after we finish eating. I didn't say anything the first 3x, just chalked it up to her having a good time or wanting to play with my border collie. The 4x after I was done cleaning, I was severely annoyed that she had yet offered to help clean up after I had cooked really delicious meals for her four times. She's a really kind person, and I would never have thought she was doing this maliciously or to use me, but when I put myself in her shoes I was astonished how she thought watching me cook and then clean without offering help was ok.

A little background, I'm was raised in NC and she was raised in MN. So when I confronted her I asked if it's considered rude in MN to not offer help cleaning up after someone cooks for you. She said it's not, and that when she cooks for someone, she doesn't want anyone in the kitchen at all. Additionally, she said it shouldn't be an expectation for the guest to offer help, and if I wanted help I should have asked for it. I did view it as an expectation that the person offers to help. We discussed it for 5 minutes, chalked it up to cultural differences, and it's now water under the bridge. I came off a bit harsh during the exchange, and she let me know the next day when we both essentially apologized to each other, but now we both need to know who the Asshole really was?"	Asshole	0	0

bvy86c	2019-06-02 15:01:22	cgessler21	WIBTA if I refused to pay a $40 fee?	"I just moved into a new apartment, and got my bill for the second months rent yesterday. I noticed that I was charged $40 more than my agreed monthly charges in my lease. 

When I questioned my landlord, he told me they are charges for administrative purposes and fees not included in the lease. The charges aren’t convenience charges, but fees for trash and pest control: both of which are listed as included utilities in my lease. 

I don’t want to be a problem resident or asshole or cheapskate, but $40 extra a month on my lease is going to amount to almost $500 dollars at the end (I’m not renewing). 

Should I just shut up and pay this? Or should I send my landlord the part of the lease where is specifically states it all will be included? He’s really nice and sweet and accommodating, so I don’t want to be rude.

UPDATE: I just sent an email with a screenshot of my rent stating that this $40 is not given anywhere in the lease. Awaiting a response!

UPDATE: I received a response of: I have provided a few sniped sections from your lease that show the verbiage for charging the fees.  
 
In March 2019 we changed our rates to include utilities for all residents, but because of how FL Law is set up we do separate the fees from rent, for the billing.
When you applied or even if you go to our website now you are quoted the full rate (2x2 bedroom $819) and it shows the breakdown of fees
(classified as other utilities). When you applied the rate was $789 per room and the fees have not changed, so the rent is $745, electricity, $30, Pest control $2, and valet trash $12
 
However I try to be a very fair manager and can see how you are interpreting the verbiage of the lease so I will remove the fees from your account.

bvy7dp	2019-06-02 14:59:23	TisI39	AITA for not giving sibling equal share of $ when deceased parent disinherited them?	"I have 3 younger siblings. 
-Sibling A has permanent disability money from the gov’t monthly for a severe mental illness. 
-Sibling B has a moderate mental disability but works full-time
-Sibling C is still a young child. 
-Step-Parent A, parent of Sibling C with Parent A, is tutor (in charge of their inheritance) due to Sibling C being a minor. 

Sibling A abused hard drugs many times and alcohol throughout teens and early 20s. Had many problems with our recently deceased Parent A. Stole money from them while they were in the hospital, threatened to damage their house, etc. 

Parent A changed their original Will 3 years after writing it. They were thinking about removing Sibling A for at least 6 months prior according to my aunt. It was changed while they were still capable mentally and psychically and at the notary. Parent A took Sibling A out of an equal inheritance of their house, giving them about 75% less.

I didn’t know the Will was changed until after they died. 

Sibling A cannot touch a single dollar of inheritance in their protected account while on disability money from the gov’t or they will be cut. Only way to access it is if they work a job and are mentally stable and not abusing any substances. They have no motivation and keep doing drugs or drinking whenever they’re out of the psych. ward, which ends up putting them right back in.

Parent B and Step-Parent B have tried guilting Sibling B and I into giving tens of thousands of dollars each to Sibling A to give them what they would have had in the original Will.

I’ve now been shunned by Parent B and their entire side of my family for not complying.

My opinion is respect Parent A’s Will knowing they thought long and hard about the decision and it’s their right to give their money how they wish in their will. Parent A suffered a long and painful illness before passing and looked like a corpse on their death bed. 

I told Parent B and Step-Parent B that when it comes time for them to write their Will, they can also do what they want with it and know that I will respect it even if they leave me nothing. 

Parent B and Step-Parent B are convincing Sibling A to contest the Will.  I doubt they will find a lawyer since Parent A changed the Will 6 months prior to death and only lost mental capability in the last month of their life. 

Step-Parent A said no way would they ever give Sibling A money after everything they’d done to them.

bvy784	2019-06-02 14:59:01		AITAH for not helping my dad in the yard?	"Hello. So backstory: my wife and I had to move back in with my parents due to some medical bills piling up and me getting ready to student teach and not be able to work the job I once was. We had a plan ready to go, but the medical bills and other complications made it to where we had to tap into those expenses. My parents let me and my wife and our very small dog move in with them and my two younger brothers. 

We just moved in this week and we are still getting the apartment ready to clean and such. My wife and I have VERY different work schedules and Saturdays are literally the only days that we can do anything productive during the day. We’ve had the plan in motion, and both my parents knew about it, and we had A LOT to do. 

My dad sent a group text to me and my brothers saying he was going to work on the yard and if we wanted to help we could if not he would do it himself. One brother works, I had the apartment, and my other brother was just there. My mom kept hounding me to not go to the apartment because my dad needs help, but I had responsibilities to make sure everything was going down in the apartment correctly. I had stuff to move, fix, and things my wife couldn’t clean that I had to. Not to mention, my other brother was literally home all day and got no lecture for not helping. My wife and I cleaned from 9 am to 5:30 pm. And I’m talking like SCRUBBING on our hands and knees. 

This morning, my mom was complaining about me saying how sometimes with family you have to do what you have to do and that it was crappy of me to not help. She also kept complaining about how long it took us to clean and she doesn’t understand.

"I read a similar post by a guy named Yusef, with the verdict being YTA for being ungrateful so I’d like to share my situation where I moved out at 18 last Monday because my parents were not in my life.

A bit of background: We’re immigrants from Uzbekistan. Both of my parents are workaholics though I understand why since we were dirt poor.

My parents were rarely interested in my life and never in my education so, until about two years ago, I always did my best in school to get their attention and not be a burden. I stopped caring about that when I realized that those efforts were futile and that I felt unreasonably guilty for doing the things that make me happy. My parents appointed my siblings (23F and 28M) as my de facto parents but they are verbally abusive and often denigrate me.

I’ve never once felt like I could trust my siblings or my parents enough to be open about my life, when I self-harmed, and my future plans for many reasons. When I finally moved out on Monday, though I didn’t plan for it to happen, I told my mom that one of the reasons I was moving out was because she was never in my life. She proceeded to tell me that she does care for me and that she works hard to support us: she feeds us, puts a roof over our head, bought a house for us to live in, etc. Part of the reason why I felt like a burden is because she holds her financial support over my head.

As the cashier rang me up (she was other wise friendly), she got to the kale and said, ""ugh, kale gives me such a headache - I cant stand the smell!"" 

This is the second time I have had a cashier at a grocery comment on my food choices in a negative way (and actually, it was a different cashier at this same store).

I replied, ""I am sure I wouldn't like some of your food choices, either."" She continued to ring me up, and I left. 

I started to feel guilty about being so snarky, since she was otherwise very nice.  But personally, I feel that someone working at a grocery store should generally keep their personal opinions about a customer's food to themselves. 

AITA?

Edit: I have also worked retail for many years, so understand the need to make small talk with customers. I didnt yell or freak out or get super upset about it, I was just a little annoyed that she would comment on my food (would a barista tell you that they don't like the drink you ordered?).  In her position, may have said something different, or more positive, but this did seem like it was her first job.

"My school does this thing where students can tutor other students; the student doing the tutoring normally receive €7 from the student they're tutoring or from that student's parents as a compensation for spending time teaching the student in need of help.

Recently, a teacher approached me, asking if I could tutor one of her students. She said he wanted to choose the subject for next year, but he isn't good enough to be able to do it as of now. I agreed, because it would earn me some extra money.

I've managed to give the guy two lessons now, so he owes me €15. I've made it clear that I should be paid; of course, I'm spending my own free time on the dude, while also needing to keep up with my own schoolwork. 

I've sent him a message, which allows him to pay me the €15 over Whatsapp. A very easy to use service, I could have my money with a few clicks from him. However, he has read the message and the reminder I sent him (a week ago), but I haven't received either an answer or payment. I fear that, if I continue teaching him, I'll end up wasting my time and not getting paid.

K has a really bumping speaker system in his house. When he plays music you can hear it a good 3-4 houses in either direction. And he plays music often... This morning it started at about 8am and he'll probably play it all day. 

He's really good about not playing music late at night (we've only had a problem once or twice) as I think he has it set to shut down at 10pm.

I've come to realize that me and this guy simply aren't very compatible. He's into the drinking/partying/drug lifestyle and I'm simply not.

She's saying it's because I use a blanket and if I think it's too hot I should just take it off, but I like at least one layer, even if it's a thin layer otherwise I just can't get comfortable."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvy0bc	2019-06-02 14:38:50	iudilemma	AITA for wanting my boyfriend to stay with me after my IUD insertion?	"Posting from a throwaway. 

&#x200B;

My boyfriend (James\*) and I have been together for 1 year. Birth control is for both our benefit. For him, it's not having to wear a condom and for me, it's reducing the risk of pregnancy. I've been on the pill for a few months until I started getting breakthrough bleeding so I figured I should just get an IUD which would provide more efficacious, long-term control. I was still nervous about the insertion itself and the side effects (irregular bleeding for the months to come, cramping, hormonal effects) and expressed them to James who told me it would be fine.

&#x200B;

Next week is the actual insertion. James said nothing more than ""it'll be fine"" so I asked explicitly for more support such as being there to get me and spending time with me after. He has no classes that afternoon, no exams for the next two weeks, and a vehicle to drive. 

&#x200B;

He asked me when my appointment was again and I said Wednesday. He agreed, but then said, ""Oh Wednesday, that's the Game 3 (basketball) isn't it?"" I asked him if he had something going on and he replied, ""No, but I feel like my classmates/friends *might* want to do something."" 

&#x200B;

I asked him if these plans were concrete and he said no, he just has a sense that some kind of party/social event will take place since they missed the last game. He'd like us there, but I said I might not want to go, and that I'd rather us do something since we haven't had an actual date night in almost 2 weeks. For comparison, he'd gone out to the club with his friends twice that week. He was intent on going and asked me, ""Does it really make a difference if I go and leave for a few hours?"" 

&#x200B;

I got quite upset when he said that. He wasn't happy either, saying he's trying to balance going out with me and seeing his friends. I book the appointments, get the medication from the pharmacy, go through the side effects and he knows this. I know an IUD insertion can vary in terms of pain from woman to woman, but I feel crummy for a non-concrete event taking precedence over something that's both our responsibility and more so mine. 

&#x200B;

AITA for wanting my boyfriend to spend the day with me after my IUD appointment?

&#x200B;

**TL;DR!** Boyfriend agreed to get me and spend time with me after my IUD insertion after I asked for more support. There *might* be a get-together with his friends that isn't solid yet, but he'd rather us go there instead of doing something ourselves. He doesn't think it matters if he goes away for a few hours."

bvxyvo	2019-06-02 14:34:33	mankal24	AITA for not wanting my ex-friend to come to my sisters wedding.	"English is not my first language so please be kind.

**FB** = friend bitch who was hitting on my bf.

**OG** = other girl friend.

**Important: At the time everything happened I had a crush on bf for 3 years and dated (at last) for about 2 months**

&#x200B;

A while ago I was best friends with two other girls. One of those told my bf she had a crush for him, and she was constantly hitting on him until I decided there was no more and we parted ways with FB(bf was 100% clean). The OG sided with FB for reasons I won't discuss here. I loved OG so much that I tried to keep in touch with her, but we ended up by her not even talking to me because of her friendship with FB. All this time that I was trying to build our friendship with the OG, she was small talking with our mutual friends and telling them that I STOLE **MY** BF FROM FB(even now, I don't know why). I tried to keep my composure and decided that it was best to cut off. My family and especially my mom, had a great relationship with OG, but nevertheless I told them what happened and they were dissapointed by OG. Keep in mind that OG doesn't even speak to my family anymore. Now, 2 years after this all happened, my sister is getting married and my mother decided that it was best to invite OG to the wedding. I am freaking out because my mom knows about the damage OG and FB caused on me and she still wants OG to come to the wedding.

So reddit, AITA for not wanting OG to come to the wedding?

I sat outside, throwing a football with some of my friends when a guy I was mildly acquainted with walks by. The group starts talking about him possibly being gay, so I assumed that it would be a nice gesture to say, “Happy Pride Month,” to him.


I go up to him and say “Hi, [his name.] Happy pride month,” think noting of it and go inside to get a bottle of water. 


When I come back outside and go back to playing with them, he runs up to me, trying to sucker punch me. Luckily he misses. He throws more punches, some of which hit while screaming that he wasn’t a “faggot” and I was mentally ill for thinking so. (Which wasn’t helped by the profuse laughter of my friends)


The weirdest part was that even if he was straight (which I’m guessing he is) why would he get so mad over me saying that.

bvxxb1	2019-06-02 14:30:03	lollipopfiend123	WIBTA if I give my mother an ultimatum?	"Background: My mother is deeply in debt, I don’t know how much but I assume well into six figures, due primarily to poor choices. Five years ago when my father died, she inherited $160k and a paid off house in good condition. She spent about $25k on various necessary things. The rest was gone in 9 months, on we don’t know what. Fast forward to now and her only income is Dad’s SS, which would be more than enough for her to live on if she were debt-free. However, she routinely borrows hundreds of dollars from me and my brother. Furthermore, she has four large dogs (75-90 pounds I’m guessing) and she chooses to feed them EXPENSIVE dog food. Like $70/bag expensive. It is not prescription. She will do this even if it means going to the food bank to feed herself. 

So here is the situation. My mother stands to inherit approximately $200k from my aunt’s estate. Part of the estate is a piece of land worth approximately $100k, with six donkeys living on it. My aunt LOVED these donkeys and my mother would like to receive them and the property as part of the value of her inheritance.

My brother and I would like to present her with an ultimatum. If she accepts the donkeys and property, as opposed to letting them be sold and getting cash to use towards her debt, we will cut her off from ever lending her another cent and will not lift one finger to care for the donkeys. Even if it means she winds up homeless. Even if it means the donkeys starve and die. Before you ask, yes, we are willing to lose our relationship with her. It is already strained at best. I barely speak to her outside of birthdays and Christmas, etc. 

If we do this, would we be the assholes?

Edited to add: we do not want any harm to come to the donkeys and would call a rescue if it actually came to that. However, I feel it’s necessary for us to be that dramatic when we speak to her, because she is *going* to assume that we will bail her out if it comes to that. She has to understand that this time, it is not going to happen."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvxwjj	2019-06-02 14:27:49	raidruiner	AITA because I got kicked out over something quite petty and my parents still want an apology from me?	"When I was 18, I had a nice amount of cash from a car accident and offered to help my parents out with things they needed for the house. They told me to keep it for university
 So I wanted to use it for things I'd need. However , my parents summon me into the living room and told me that they wanted half of the car accident money. I asked why? They told me it was only fair. I told them no because they didn't force my older brother (who was claiming dole at the time and would just do what he wanted and smoked weed despite my dad being in the police) to pay anything. I was kinda upset that they would just demand the money, so I asked to go to my friend's house and talk to him about it. 

 He said that if I didn't want to stay at home, stay at his. But I needed some essentials and went back. But my mistake was telling my parents that I was staying at his for the night. 

I was then chased downstairs and my mother threw herself against the door. I raised my arms thinking she'd smack me (she's done it before) and then I'm grabbed by the collar of my coat and thrown to the floor by my dad. He proceeds to scream and yell in my face about how I'm a horrid ungrateful cow I was, and my mam did slap my face when I didn't respond. How could I? I was a tiny 18 year old paralysed with fear, clutching onto my bag terrified of what my parents were doing. Eventually my mam grabbed me, pulled me up and threw me out. I was left wailing in the street and went back to my friend's house to cry to him and his mam. They told me to just stay permanently. 

I tried going back a week later, but they both demanded an apology of me and after sitting there listening to them yell at me, I decided I didn't want to stay there anymore, and I left with my friend. 

In the 7 years since, I moved into a place with my friend, we've been dating for 4 and a half years but the family affair hovers around. Everyone except my dad have tried to talk about moving on, putting it past us and all that. My mam and I have had arguments were she still thinks that they didn't do anything wrong, and I've called her out. I've told her what I want which I think isn't unreasonable. I want her and my dad to apologise to me for their over reaction. That's it. But she told me that ""oh well I don't think he'd apologise"". Then what's the point? 

So what I'm asking is that am I an arsehole for not wanting to deal with them anymore? I've decided that for my mental health, no. I don't, but I'm concerned that they're gonna go around to the rest of the family, call me the arsehole and blame my boyfriend for the live I lead now

bvxw87	2019-06-02 14:26:51	fredinNH	AITA for telling my wife she spent too much on my birthday present?	"tl,dr: wife used $1300 worth of credit card points to book 2 nights at a hotel for a milestone birthday for me. I upset her by saying that it was way more money than I felt comfortable spending. 

So I was reviewing my credit card activity like I do about once a month and I noticed that my chase rewards points total seemed lower than I thought it was. I took a look at recent activity and saw that 85,000 points had been used to book 2 nights at a favorite hotel of my wife and I. This is almost $1300 worth on the sapphire reserve card. 

We have never spent more than $400 on a hotel room, so I assumed it was a mistake. I thought maybe one of us was looking at rooms and accidentally booked it. It never crossed my mind that it wasn’t a mistake. So I started calling for my wife.”hey Fred’s wife, were you looking at rooms at such and such hotel?”

She comes in with a sad look on her face and explains to me that it was a surprise for my birthday. I immediately said that it was way more money than we should be spending for 2 nights somewhere. I said that we could stay somewhere for a week for that many points. She says that it’s for my birthday and we can afford it and it’s the best room in the hotel (somewhat famous hotel in a somewhat exotic location, BTW). I say that I thought we were saving all those points to fly our daughter to and from college. She gets upset. Now we’re not talking about it. 

The booking is cancellable and I want to cancel it and use the points for something that offers more bang for the buck. AITA?

Update. Talked it through with wife and decided to cancel 1 of the 2 nights she booked at fancy hotel, but extend the trip to 3 nights with 2 of them at a more reasonably priced (but still very nice) hotel nearby. We will spend less overall, but get an extra night and have the experience she wanted me to have. She’s a wonderful, understanding woman. As I said, I’m a lucky man."	No A-holes here	0	0

I talked with B and told him i want to put some distance between us and i don't want to talk with him much now on, even though he said okay he still kept talking with me.

Yesterday he sent me some pictures from WhatsApp which made me uncomfortable (it's about a private matter but nothing sexual don't worry) i showed them to my other friend insisted me on blocking him and i told B that i no longer want to talk with him and i will block him, he asked why and i said i have personal reasons, then he said ''don't talk with me and have a good day.'' and blocked me.

Pardon a lot of curse words, just realized how much there is after proof reading, I'm still pretty mad about this guy and how his fans are acting.

For context, it's a pirate game. It has an Arena mode that's all about PvP but I've been playing Adventure. Almost everyone I've met is cool, I've had several sessions where our entire server was in an alliance. I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly people are! I get it's a pirate game and you know, stealing is the pirate way, but some people are dicks about it. Like if you're looking for other players to fight, there's a flag you can fly that shows you are hostile.

Then this asshole comes along to ruin everyone's day. He's spawn camping new players in adventure. Just terrorizing anyone he sees that isn't all decked out. He's been playing a long time and grinded out every quest cuz he has no life and apparently doesn't play anything else.

Well we are stopping trying to help a couple of kids figure out how to start the Tall Tale quests. I'm a mom and gamer, I have a soft spot for helping kids. Suddenly, this guy rolls into the outpost and completely destroys their galleon and killed the one guy who was still on it then starts attacking ours. We all get in my crews galleon and start chasing him down. We lose the first fight cuz the kids offered to do repairs on the ship and well... Sucked at it. 

We sink and then get a message from a guy. He knows the streamer and fucking hates him and offers help. We have my hubby leave cuz he was getting tilted and losing his shit. I just wanted to kick this guys ass. After he tells us about this stream my hubby starts watching it and this guy is fucking flaming us. He's calling us all kinds of names and all that. I lose my shit when he starts shit talking about me for being a girl. I load up the stream on my phone, comment calling him to quit being a pussy and fly the PvP flagand we will settle this. I kept the stream going in the background listening to him talk shit cuz I wanted to hear him rage when we got to him.

We finally catch him and we sink him 4 times and the last time we are on his ship dancing while killing them as they spawn. His team and fan base are calling us assholes for spawn camping. Mind you, in the 15 minutes we were making our original plan and getting the guy that messaged us in (who was also a really great player that had been playing for a long time and cool as shit) he was camping a brand new player that was solo and hadn't even gotten clothes yet.

bvxuzj	2019-06-02 14:23:23		AITA for not telling my mom I’m not a virgin?	"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years—all of high school. He’s been around my family and he’s helped us out a lot with different things around the house, so my mom definitely likes him. My mom has grown to trust us very much as opposed to when we began dating. This means, he’s allowed over when no one is home and we’re allowed to go out (almost) wherever we please. I’m grateful for the freedom she gives me and so is he, we think she’s very supportive of our relationship and it makes us happy. We do everything we can do give back to her (running errands, washing our dog, etc). 

However, all this trust comes with a downfall; she trusts *too* much. 

My boyfriend and I lost our virginities to each other when our relationship was relatively new, before my mom had trusted us at all. Ever since then...well, we’ve had sex a ton (as most teenagers do). Almost every time we’re alone or have the chance, we’re doing something sexual to some degree. We don’t see each other as often because he moved early on within our relationship and lives an hour away, which is mostly why we get out of control.

At some point not too long ago, the topic of birth control came up and I asked my mom if she would be okay if I got on it (I was testing the waters). She very innocently responded with, “Why would you need to?” 

I felt my face somehow turn tomato red and the blood completely drain from it. I just assumed after so long and us being young she would have put the pieces together, but she has an incredible amount of trust in us. 

So, ever since then, I’ve gently been trying to allude to the fact we are sexually active in hopes she will get the idea. 

I know some people will say I’m dumb for trying to ruin a “good” thing by her being oblivious but it hurts my conscious. My boyfriend says just to leave it be and that telling her at any capacity will hurt her way more than figuring it out herself later on. I agree, it will hurt her, but it hurts *me* to see her completely oblivious to it."		1	0

I moved to a friends place for free at 15ish because I couldn't afford to both pay rent/bills and finish high school. When I was almost 18 my parents had my younger sister. At that point I had already moved interstate for uni and was fully supporting myself.

She's now 14, one of my parents has passed away and the other is currently unable to look after her for health reasons. The family is wanting me to take my sister in but I'm not interested. I've told them they can take her in. I'm getting told how heartless I am. Thing is, I don't want to look after a teenager.  I've only interacted with my sister a handful of times. I share parents with her but that's pretty arbitrary and isn't' really a compelling argument.

Seeing how internet randos react, will help me gauge how to talk about it with other people. Overall though, I'm pretty happy with my life situation right now and not looking to upend it.

Edit/Update: Some of you want some more info.

The family that wants me to take my sister in are: Parent, aunts and uncles. They're all 60+ and most say they don't have the health or finances to take her in.  
I still live in a different state. If I were to look after her, either I move to her state or she moves in with me (I'd have to move to rent a 2-bedroom place then).  
If no one takes my sister in, I guess she might go to foster care?  
In terms of my work/life, the bulk is FIFO work. I live on my own. Financially, I'm doing ok for myself."	No A-holes here	0	0

My girlfriend and I recently moved into a rental, she has a son around 7, that she splits custody with the father who lives nearby, like ten minutes away. He has him during the week and we have him on weekends. 

Already though I’m having some difficulty with it since either we have to find a sitter or one of us has to stay home by around 7 on the weekends. 

There was a miscommunication recently this weekend where I thought we had plans to go out to Pride and she thought I wasn’t interested this year and couldn’t find a sitter- so it didn’t happen. 

I asked her if there was a chance we could tweak the days like the father has the kiddo Tuesday-Friday and we have him Saturday-Monday. She said she brought up that to the dad at first, but it was shot down since the dad didn’t want the weekdays split up. 

There’s always the option of a sitter, but I thought we could ask to edit the days first...

bvxrj6	2019-06-02 14:13:34	frankismydog	AITA for being frustrated that my husband’s father is sick and dying?	"A little background, my husband has 5 siblings and grew up in Brazil and I grew up in USA. He lived there his whole life and when we got married (5 years ago) I moved there to be with him while we applied for his residency in the USA. Our ultimate goal was to move to the USA and find work, start a family, save money. 

About 3 years ago, his 80 year old father started to feel tired. It began with him not moving around as much and asking his family to bring him everything to his room. During this time, I also got pregnant and had a baby boy.  We raised our son in Brazil for about 2 years until my husband got his green card. Once he got it, we planned to move to the USA within six months. Well, his father’s health kept declining and for the past year we put off our move to take care of him. I mentioned my husbands siblings because I always felt they didn’t put in as much work as my husband did to take care of their father. My husband was basically his primary care taker. As you can imagine, this is very hard and constant work. His siblings would help out, but most of the responsibility landed on my husband. We found out a few months ago, his father has stage 4 cancer. 

Although this news was heartbreaking, we couldn’t put off our move any longer this year. We had to move to the USA or risk losing the green card and all the money we invested. We made arrangements and my husbands siblings took over the care-taking responsibilities for his father. 

We’ve been in the US for about a month now. Our move was very emotional for my husbands family because they grew accustomed to having us around. My husband is also feeling very guilty about leaving when his father is on his death bed. 

As expected, it’s taken a lot to adjust to life here for all of us. I am currently 7 months pregnant and working. My husband is looking for work but hasn’t been successful yet. On top of that, his family sends him messages saying how much they want him to come back and how much they need him. 

He wants to go back for a couple months and I can’t help but feel exasperated. I love my husbands family and I can understand the absolute stress everyone is under, but I feel like our children and I are being pushed to the side lines. Also, this complicates his residency application.

I have been completely supportive of whatever my husband decides. I always tell him I totally understand what he’s going through and this is his decision to make. But I keep thinking if he goes back, it will only cause more work and stress for me. I basically have to work, raise my son and prepare for birth on my own. On top of that, I would truly just miss my husband so much if it wasn’t here with me. Thinking about him leaving makes me feel so sad and lonely.

Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

Ever since my parents got divorced in 2008, my dad has had a very hard time trying to land in a stable relationship with another woman. From 2008 to current, he’s dated about 7 white women (this detail is important later).

I love my dad- When my parents divorced, he spent thousands of dollars to get me away from my mother. My mother is a mentally ill and abusive woman, and my dad managed to pull me and provide me with a safe childhood. However, my dad has bipolar disorder and refuses to get medicated for it. Both his highs and lows are very extreme. During his depressive episodes, he’s called me names, thrown me around, locked me in my room etc. He threatens to send me back to my mothers- And this usually doesn’t end until I’m basically on my knees, enduring such a long panic attack begging for him to forgive me and not send me away.  The crime for these punishments? Swearing, not picking up towels from the floor, not making lunch, etc. 

Our relationship is pretty strained. Even though it is just us two, we barely talk unless my dad is experiencing a manic or a depressive episode. So when my dad announced two years ago that his most recent girlfriend was pregnant, I was less than excited. 

Remember when I said my dad only dated white women? My mother was the only POC my father has ever dated, and after the divorce, my father has had a disdain for POC. And unfortunately for me, I look 100% like my mom. My dad’s current wife is a woman from Düsseldorf, who I’ll call Mary. 

Mary is a nice woman, and we get along decently enough. We’re distant- Bc my dad usually interrupts any sort of conversation I’m having with her bc “Mary’s not interested in that”. We don’t have a mother-son type of relationship at all, as much as my dad and her parents like to say that we do. My dad and Mary’s son was born a year ago, and he’s the apple of my dad’s eye (understandably). I love that baby too though, So I’m not blaming or angry at my brother.

Ever since the baby was born, the already little relationship I had with my dad and Mary was gone. My dad has had barely any positive contact with me even though we live in the same house and Mary + baby live in Germany- I completely understand how painful it is to have people you love thousand of miles away, but he takes that anger out on me. All of the calls and texts I send Mary are ignored, even though she spends hours texting with my dad to show him the baby or pictures of him at the park. The baby is white, and my entire family loves it. Mary’s parents and family are a completely different story. I don’t know if Mary has said anything about me to them previously, but through all of the contact we’ve had they’ve treated me like shit. I feel terrible for not wanting to be around them and not liking them, but at the same time I feel as if I have the right to feel like I’m respected in my new family."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Now, I graduate today, in about 3 hours, I am writing this on my laptop after everything was said and done. So, me and my mom have been having arguments over the past 2 days about a light blue/green tinted shirt. She wants me to wear it, the instructions were to bring ""a white shirt with color"". I had a white shirt, one SHE bought for me a month ago, which is  in brand new shape. first she threatened to not let me get a 10$ an hour job I had been looking forward to, then, she threw tantrums when I refused to wear her shirt. Well, I took a shower this morning, and when I asked for my clothes, ladeedah, she gives me that shitty blue/green shirt, I decide to not make a fuss about it, I have all the time in the world to yell at her for, essentially ruining MY day. I worked damn hard to be here, and I (incorrectly) assumed that so long as I stayed within the rules, I would choose. I sulk, weep, mourn over my day being, essentially stolen from me for the pleasure of my mother. I put on the shirt, but leave out the dress shirt straps (forgot their name) because I have some honor. This wasn't good enough, she wanted me to wear a tie, I only have a black one, dark red, and blood red tie. I said no, complaining that I'd stick out because of how much in conflicted with the terrible shirt. She blew up, claimed I could wear whatever I want and that she doesn't care, so I put on my choice of shirt and typed this out.

She gave me a lot of things she no longer wanted. Photos, frames, small home decor items. Among the items she gave me an old purse. The next time she saw me I was at work - and I was not using the purse she had given me. She asked why and I told her I hadn’t really given it much thought. (I am not the kind of person who changes purses or wallets often. I have a purse that is big, full of trash and some important items that I will probably use until a strap or zipper breaks.) 
She then tells me that she has several friends who would like the purse and would actually use it. 
I told her no problem, I’ll give it back so that it can go to someone who will use it right away. 
She thinks I’m bluffing. I know I am going to see her the next day. 
So I bring the purse with me to work and give it back to her when she comes in. 
She is insulted!
When I ask her why she explains that she doesn’t understand why I am not using the purse she gave me. The purse I am currently using is “filthy and falling apart” 
But it isn’t - so I know she is just saying mean things at this point for the sake of doing it. 
I didn’t push it any further. I told her she was being mean for no reason and handed her back her black purse that so many of her friends wanted so badly. 
Later in the day I was told by another family member how hurt her feelings are. 
Maybe I’m an asshole - but I don’t feel bad about this one at all. It felt good to hand the purse back to her!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Things have been like this ever since. I think they are nice people and they sometimes invite us to go places with them but any attempt at conversation I make gets me one word answers. I feel as if they dislike me and I don't really feel like putting in effort because of this.

bvxgxz	2019-06-02 13:41:38	ducky1579	AITA for going to my union rep?	"I (22f) work in a Male dominated field of work.

I work 10 hour days Monday to Friday, and then am expected to work for an undetermined amount of time every Saturday if it's called for. 

I wake up at three in the morning, so I consume a large amount of caffeine to wake up, as well as a lot of water since my job is physically demanding.

My superiors have complained about my bathroom use, as I have to walk across a large shop into an office building as there is no designated womens bathroom, and often have to wait outside of one of my bosses offices until the bathroom is free.

This has led to my supervisor asking in front of my coworkers if I am expecting (I'm not) which is obviously embarrassing.

I asked my union rep if the bathroom situation is up to code with ohsa standards, as well as informed him of how improper it is to have been asked if I am expecting, and also discussed that the only reason anyone has paid attention to my bathroom use is because I have to walk across a large distance and wait outside of a bathroom to use it while everyone else has an easily accessible bathroom to use close to their work station.

My union rep now is going to hold a meeting with our superiors, and my team is going to have to have a meeting about work appropriate conversations.

There are lots of kids on my floor, which is fine, however the last 6 months or so their parents have been sending them out into the hall to play, I'm constantly tripping on toys, almost getting run over by kids on bikes/scooters/rollerblades and of course, they are noisy. This happens as early as 6 am and as late as 11pm. I have complained to the onsite landlords several times to no avail, I have also spoken with the parents and the response I got was basically that they pay rent so their kids can play wherever they want, so I am thinking about contacting the rental company that runs my complex.

I wasn't trained, so what I do are only guesses--and sometimes those guesses means making mistakes until someone corrects me.

So I have this manager, 5 or 6 weeks clean and out of rehab and she is super moody. As in, if you make a mistake, she will get PISSED. And she will let everyone know she's mad, and takes it out on whoever she's mad at (usually me).

Because of this, my anxiety has spiked. I can't do anything right, nobody bothers to help me learn and instead it's, ""figure it out yourself"" which equates to screwing up. This means the register, making food, drive through (no training, had to guess, got yelled at because the person waited too long while I pushed buttons). Among other things.

So I'm now barely sleeping and having panic attacks at the idea of going in. And I know if I have to deal with her, I will lose it on her while sleep deprived and highly anxious.

And they made a girl with a bad respiratory infection come in yesterday, even though she was coughing to the point of puking and wouldn't let her *leave*, even though customers complained or were leaving themselves.

So even though we're short staffed and need help, and Sunday is usually a very busy day, AITA for calling out? Certainly feel like it.

bvxc1f	2019-06-02 13:25:53	danparkin10x	AITA for being angry at a friend for posting a picture of my ex on social media?	"I met a girl in the first year of university (about two years ago). We hit it off straight away and within a few months we were a couple. The relationship was strong and everything was going perfectly until one day, after about 9 months, she decided she didn’t want to be with me anymore. I won’t go into details about the breakup other than it was over text and we’ve never talked about it since.

It has taken it’s toll on me, and I have been immensely depressed since. I take anti-depressants but even they don’t work. It has impacted my entire world view, made me extremely closed out of fear of getting hurt, and I haven’t opened up to anybody new since. 

Anyway, I have a friend from home who I also go to university with. We are incredibly close. During my entire relationship with the aforementioned girl, this friend absolutely detested her. They made me feel awkward whenever I was around my girlfriend and made it clear she did not approve. They were happy when the relationship ended and made no secret of this.

In the two years since, this friend and my ex have become somewhat casual acquaintances when they see each other on a night out, often chat and speak in a friendly way, which even though I find jarring, it is what it is.

However when we went to a party yesterday, where all involved were present, the pair of them both put several pictures of one another on Instagram and Snapchat. I feel hurt by this by both of them, and feel like my own feelings have completely ignored.

I am especially annoyed with my friend, and feel totally betrayed. I am so angry and am considering just ending contact with them for a while, in order to get my head in order.

I’m 17 and I live in a very very catholic small community. I have a best friend who I know is gay but won’t come out until after school because he needs his parents money and a place to live etc. A rumour started going around that he was gay, and his parents found out and threatened to kick him out. He asked me to pretend to be his girlfriend and I said yes and now we’ve been “dating” for a year and a half. 

I had a secret boyfriend when I lived in France for a year when I was 15 but I never slept with him. I recently went back to France, had sex with him and fell pregnant. I don’t want to get an abortion, so I asked my “boyfriend” if I could say it’s his (in our community abortion would be a lot worse than pre maritial sex). I’m 24 weeks along and everyone in our community knows it’s his baby. I’m planning on continuing to lie about who’s baby it is until I turn 18 and then I’m moving far far away. He’s planning to get out of town as soon as he’s 18 as well. 

He has started being a bit more uncertain about me lying. He hasn’t said outright he wants me to stop lying, but I’m worried that’s what it will come to. The only person who knows the truth is my other best friend, who thinks it’s an asshole move to lie to everyone and make my “boyfriend” also lie. I’ve talked to him about it and he says he doesn’t care, it won’t even matter in a year when all these people in our community will have forgotten about us.

I am the second of four children. Myself and all my siblings have children of our own. My son Adam and daughter Maria are 13 and 11. My sister Claire and her husband Matt have one daughter, Rachel. 

Rachel is 15 and she is a massive bully to the other kids. Since she is the oldest all the girls look up to her, and since she was little she has a few cousins who she has enjoyed excluding and making them feel left out. Every family gathering for as long as I can remember has ended with someone in tears and the problem usually being traced back to Rachel. Yesterday Maria came up to me crying because Rachel told her that she was stupid and ugly. 

I had a word with Claire and said that while she and Matt are welcome, I don't want them bringing Rachel here since she is a bully and troublemaker. 

There is a problem however. Rachel was born with numerous health conditions. Type 1 diabetes, asthma and life threatening allergies. She also has very poor vision and even with her glasses cannot see perfectly. 

Claire tried to tell me it wasn't fair to exclude Rachel given everything else she has been through. I do understand her perspective. Rachel is constantly in and out of hospital and her health is understandably a huge worry for her parents, but even so, she comes here and teases her cousins until they cry, and Claire and Matt insist that their pretty princess is just joking.

bvx7sa	2019-06-02 13:12:47		AITA for telling Mom her good-will doesn't belong in certain situation	"Okay so, back story. 

My immediate family live in the city (my parents have done well for themselves, so we're quite well off) and my dad's side of the family live up in a more rural and much poorer area. We're pretty detached from that side of the family and rarely speak/see them apart from, mostly because my dad just isn't close to them for his own reasons I guess. He just doesn't have a whole lot in common with them and has worked hard for 30 years to maintain his lifestyle.

While my mother's been helping to plan for a birthday party for grandma (dad's side), she found out that they don't want my cousin coming on the grounds that he's a drug addict and said really horrible things to my grandma, I guess they just don't want that drama. 

After this conversation, my mother has now taken it upon herself to help (she has no experience in helping people get off drugs), even though we haven't had contact with him in years and the only thing we know about the situation is that he's become homeless and even his immediate family are at a loss. 

I think, partly, she wants to help him because she herself has been addicted (alcoholism) and so she feels in some way she can relate??  My mother even suggested inviting him to our house...which seems incredibly naive and foolish. I know her hearts in the right place, but logically, it doesn't seem like a good decision especially since we hardly know him and what difference are we gonna make (the well off side of the family in the city who rarely see them) that his immediate family haven't made. Me, my dad and my siblings think we would just look like condescending assholes, but my mother is really sad and affected by it, especially because of our situation in comparison to theirs (beside money, a lot of unfortunate shit has happened for them, unexpected deaths, abusive relationships, etc). But, we don't know the half of it and just because it's a horrible situation, what good could we do sticking our nose in it?

Ok so my mum died back in 2006 ( I was only 2 years old at the time). After a few years my dad got married with someone else, and all was good: I had a stepmom and 2 stepsisters and my dad had a wife. They divorced a few years ago. Me and my dad had a very hard time back then due to my father not being able to work cuz of health issues. My ex-stepmom got to keep the house and we were forced to live in hotels for a few days. 
Anyways we're doing good now. One day I had to download an app for my dad and saw he had downloaded multiple dating apps and has also deleted them. I found out on accident. When i asked him about it, he basically shrugged it off and told me it was for another reason than finding someone. I know he's been talking to women. 

Now my dad is a 42 year old man and I get why he's searching for someone. We've talked about the matter a few times and I basically told him I wouldn't be comfortable if he, you know, marries again/gets a gf. I don't really want him to find a gf/wife, because when they break up/divorce I'm not sure if my dad will be alright. He's overdosed on medicine once on purpose because of the previous divorce and Im really worried about him. At the same time I feel like I'm taking something away from him, which I dont want to do.

It only takes 35 minutes to do. Wife says nicely to them to visit facility next week when they’re up to it. I was pissed for her not confronting them about the procrastination and cancellation which they have done in the past. I gave her an  ultimatum to say something or I WILL. She was hesitant but I continue to tell her she’s a pushover and finally obliged with that push and told them why so long to cancel and she waited 3 HOURS which would only take 35 mins tops. When wife went to facility, BIL and family went there anyways. She was pissed. The rift made it to MIL, who ends up crying in front of FIL that affected his recovery as he felt her frustration and sadness. My wife felt that she should’ve let it go.  I feel that if they can’t handle this and be considerate of people’s time then they should not be counted on. I hate that we’re having to walk on eggshells cause of his feelings. My itch to say something would have been more blowup than hers. What do you think? Should I just let it go and not push her into it?	No A-holes here	0	0
bvx5vo	2019-06-02 13:06:57	Skenzz	AITA for lying to not pick up my friend from the airport	"I have a friend (23 F) who I messed around with a little (no strings attached) before she went overseas last month. She was due back on Friday and asked me if I was okay taking a day off work to pick her up from the airport and hang out with her for a bit. No biggie. It'd be a nice thing to do for a friend and we could have some fun on the day.

After telling her I was okay with it, I asked her if her parents were okay with me dropping her off. This is where I start getting uncomfortable. She tells me that she doesn't want her parents picking her up or knowing she's back because she wants to party and get drunk later that night and the entire weekend at a friend's place instead. ""That's understandable"" I thought. We're young and if we get a chance to do something fun, why not take it. Then she goes on to ask me if I can drive her to the city so she can catch up with some colleagues during lunch and pick up the keys to her friend's apartment who also works in the city.

At this point I start to feel like I'm being used and treated like an Uber Driver and an errand boy rather than someone who she genuinely just wants to hang out with. What disappointed me the most after that was when I found out she didn't even ask the guy she was staying with if he could take a day off to do all this for her which would be much more convenient before she asked me. To which she asked afterwards and told me he didn't have a car. Is that guy's job somehow more important than mine?

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bothered that it was another guy she was staying with, but it just made me wonder if I was just being used to kill time on top of all of that so things could stay ""fresh"" between them when they meet after he got back from work. Am I to be used to kill time during the day after driving you and your luggage around and helping you with your tasks and that guy is to have fun with at night? 

I originally told her I was free to pick her up but after hearing everything else and thinking about how much of a beta I'd be if I agreed to do this, I lied and said an event came up for work that I had to attend and told her to just catch an Uber instead which she did. She was a bit salty, especially after I told her I couldn't find time to just hang either. It's been on my mind the entire weekend. Curious to hear what you guys think!"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I just got an invite to an event some old classmates have organised but in all honesty I'm not interested in ""catching up"" with people I was acquaintances with in HS, people who I haven't spoken to in the last 10 years. 

I talk to maybe 4 people still from HS since it wrapped up and honestly I'm okay with it. I didnt have a bad HS experience, I was friendly with everybody and everybody with me but I personally dont see the appeal in seeing all these people who have been non-existent in my life since graduating. 

I made a comment on the thread saying why I wasnt going to be going and since I posted it I've got a couple of messages from these people as well as 2 of my friends just saying that I'm shitting on the party. It probably does sound pompous and my two cents is unwarranted but it's how I feel. 

""Thanks for the invite to the event, the thought really is appreciated but I'm going to have to give it a miss. The sentiment is nice and no doubt I hope those who do attend have a great time reliving old memories and catching up but I'm not interested in joining. Its been 10 years since school finished and I've barely spoken to anyone from our graduating class, I get it though, life happens and people get busy but I'm not keen to meet up, fake pleasantries and compare our lives to one anothers for one night to not talk for another ten years.
All the best to everyone though 👍""

bvx3bk	2019-06-02 12:59:01	Marag3n	AITA for calling out my mother for dismissing my younger brother.	"First sorry for formatting I'm on my phone.


This happened a couple of hours ago during dinner conversations. My younger brother (11) started a conversation about how he had seen a cat being walked, an usual thing from where we're from that sparked a nice conversation. During it our mother said along the lines of ""what does it matter, you don't have a cat"", which instantly resulted in my brother shutting up.


A couple of minutes later when conversation was dying down I decided to ask our mother ""What does (brother) owning a cat have to do with a conversation about him seeing one walking?"" She could come up with a valid reason so dropped it but just gave me a stink eye occasionally throughout dinner.


Dinner is finishing up and the partner of our uncle who is staying with us spoke up and said I was disrespecting my mother, which in all fairness I understood, and how I should respect her more. I asked her to elaborate which resulted in the typical ""she gave birth to you"", ""she provides for you"". After the spiel I asked to explain my side and said that by dismissing my young impressional brother that she could be harming his future social skills by not speaking out of fear that his conversations will be rejected or dismissed. It ended there after our uncle motioned for her to drop it and I didn't want to bring it up and cause a fight.


So am I the asshole in this situation Reddit?

bvx2gf	2019-06-02 12:55:57	Joe-Slater	"AITA For pretending my son's ""Grandad"" simply doesn't exist to me."	"Ok so there is some back story, I have a 8 year old son with my ex things were rocky but I think we're good friends now, we call and discuss our son have chats about it and generally have a friendly relationship.

Her ""Dad"" (quotations because he isn't a blood relation but if I get into it, it will be obvious if someone she knows reads it), has hated me from day one, how do I know she told me he did. He was her ""dad"" early on in our relationship and he has just hated me, nothing was said to me that wasn't rude, mean, spiteful, hateful, you get the point.  I've talked to my ex and she has just said that's what he's like, but he has loved all her ex's even the ones that have assulted her.  Something which I have never and will never do.  You may think this was an exaggeration but I promise you, he has NEVER been nice or friendly towards me, NEVER.  I know I am saved as ""Dickhead"" on his phone and he regularly insults me to my son which my son later tells me about.

So she lived with him for a while and I had to see him regularly, in order to keep a good relationship going with her while she was there.  I was nothing but friendly and nice despite his continuous comments that insulted me and just generally rude. But she has since moved away from him so I rarely see him but each time I have done I simply pretend he doesn't exist.  I don't look at him I don't speak to him I kiss and hug my son goodbye see he gets through the door way and I just walk off, not a word to anyone else.

So I dropped my son off today with him as he lives closer to me and was driving to my ex's anyway and my ex asked if I could drop him off there to save me some petrol (she lives quite far away) which I obviously said yes too.  Come time to drop off my boy I hug and kiss him, tell him I love him and just walk off after he enters the house.  As I'm leaving I get a ""Your fucking welcome!"" From behind me, but I ignore it and just get in my car and go.  I know that if I talk to him again I will let loose and knowing his volatile, ugly and angry personality we will end in physical violence which I really don't want. I don't think this one act makes up for the years of misery, years of biting my tounge and remaining happy and pleasant while he is rude, crual and vindictive towards me. 

Now my ex is upset I was rude to her ""dad"" and can't seem to understand why I was being so rude.  Because despite reminding her of how he treats me she still thinks I should have been nice to him.  I said I wasn't being rude I am just refusing to acknowledge he exists.

Seriously guys my feelings towards him are that of pure hatred.  I have been bullied relentlessly most of my life and only till I met this vile human being did I know true hatred towards someone. 

So yeah AITA for rather than interact with this person choose to simply ignore the fact they actually exist?

bvx1tw	2019-06-02 12:53:53	xJukeaWallx	WIBTA for getting my brother punished for screaming at his video games?	"This is being posted on mobile, sorry for formatting issues. 

***Edit as this is crucial information that I forgot to include. I'm diagnosed autistic and I have trouble with loud noises. It's always been a problem with me and everyone in my family knows it. 

Alright, so I (M18) have a little brother (12) who has just gotten off a multiple-month suspension from playing video games. This is due mostly for buying things without permission, yelling at the TV when his character dies, and getting suspended from his school for getting in a fight. 

I don't mind him playing video games, it's what he does while playing that bothers me. 

He mostly plays Fortnite, which as most people know, is a shooting game that is super competitive. Before he got in trouble, he would scream when he died, jump up and down and stomp on our hardwood floors, and basically shove his microphone into his mouth and scream. Me, being an avid gamer, know that screaming into your microphone is really bad gamer etiquette, which makes me feel bad for the people in his voice chat. 

The yelling into his mic isn't the thing I have the most problem with. It's the extremely loud screaming. It can literally be heard from a block away. 

The garage is my room, which is a good ~30ft from the main house, and the screaming can be picked up by my microphone and broadcast into my own voice chats with my friends. 

Yesterday I snapped. I told him very firmly that he needed to stop yelling. (I tell him usually every day but I finally just snapped. 

When he responded by yelling (at the same volume) that I needed to ""mind my own business,"" and ""he can scream if he wants to."" I got extremely mad and told him that he needs to get his act together or else I will personally make sure that our parents ground him again. (I have dirt on him that he knows I know. It's nothing violent, mostly just petty stuff that adds up to a lot, such as dodging chores and asking me to not tell anyone, eating things that he knows he isn't supposed to eat because they're for someone else, etc.)

bvwz6u	2019-06-02 12:44:38		AITA For not caring if my grandmother lives or dies?	"TLDR at the bottom.

Growing up, I hated staying with my grandparents on vacations because my grandfather was very strict. Running in the house, slamming a door could earn you a yelling that would reduce you to tears. I once tried to run away from there, but went back because I realised I didn't know my way home (was about 6 at the time).

Amidst this, my grandmother was my solace. She was always compassionate, never yelled, and was a great cook, basically the perfect grandmother.

My extended family is pretty close. Athough we live far away from each other, we frequently spent vacations at each others' homes.

When I was around 13, my cousin sister (a year younger) stayed over at my place. As with all teenagers, we used to stay up late playing video games and watching movies. And when you're that young, staying up past your parents' bedtime makes things seem a lot more fun.

One day, my mom came up to me and, uncharacteristically firmly, made me go to bed before they did. My cousin and I were both annoyed at the time, but we didn't rebel.

Years went by, and we drifted apart, because my parents weren't keen on having her over.

Years later, when I was giving my exams and applying to colleges, I hear my mom arguing with someone on the phone and telling them to go to hell. I asked who it was and she said it was my grandmother. This was out of character, but I didn't press too much - I didn't think it was my place to pry.

Fast forward a decade, and my immediate family is at dinner together. I casually remark about how I hadn't met cuz in years, and the statement seemed to hang way heavier than it should've.

Turns out, my grandmother had demanded that one of the adults stay awake with us, all night if necessary, to make sure that I didn't sexually abuse MY SISTER.

My parents found that insinuation unacceptable and so made sure a situation of allegations would never arise preemptively.

Mom, already angry, finally bursts out and says that the argument (around my college application period) was because my grandmother was angry with my parents for ""putting too much pressure on my, and that they shouldn't press their aspirations on me because I didn't have the brains to pull it off.""

At this point, I feel the need to state that I've gone through most of school getting an A or A+, was the captain of the soccer team, and valedictorian. I'm also NOT from Alabama. And the worst thing I've been ""caught"" doing is sexting my girlfriend.

From that moment, She was dead to me. Initial hatred gave way to cold indifference, and my relations with her went from those of a loving grandson to purely transactional.

To this day, I haven't ever been able to forgive or forget what I consider an unacceptable betrayal of a relationship built from literally the day I was born.

TLDR: grandmother assumed that I was a brainless sexual deviant decades ago, and I haven't been able to forgive her for it."		1	0

bvwv3w	2019-06-02 12:29:59	HiTek_142857	AITA for not wanting to go on holiday to an island with my friends?	"I have been friends with them for about 4 years. To be fair, I didn't actually choose them as friends. I was always an outsider and they were too. So under many circumstances I ended up becoming friends with them.

They're very good characters. I do like their behaviour and attitude and it's kind of difficult to find that kind of character to people nowdays. However, they have a major drawback, all of them. They're childish. Not childish in a way most people think of. They're not naughty or anything. They just think like 10 year olds. Literally. They're afraid to do stuff without asking for permission from other adults. They're afraid to take responsibilities. And they're 19 for Christ's sake.

Last year we decided to go on holiday on an island. I decided to join them. It was the worst holiday ever. They brought food from their mothers, like if there weren't any restaurants available on the tourist-centered island. Some days we didn't even get out of the hotel. We always used the taxi to go everywhere, spending a lot of money when we could take the bus. We walked like 1km and they were all like ""my feet hurt, I'm so tired!"". Honestly me and everyone else of that age I know walks like 6km every day to go to university or work. I felt like I was in a trip with the kindergarten but without parental company. I felt disgusted by them.

Apparently, they thought it was fun. So, from the very beginning of this year, we (unfortunately me too) were discussing about where our next ""holiday"" will be. I had stated that I don't want to go on holiday with them ever again, but they thought I was joking. Now, since I made the mistake to join the discussion, I will have no excuse to tell them in order not to join them on the trip. They'll say that we decided about the trip before and I should have arranged my plans accordingly.

Nevertheless, I'm still trying to find an excuse not to go on a holiday trip with them this summer and maybe find a plan to get out of this friend group. Honestly, please tell me, AITA for trying to avoid them after all this?"	No A-holes here	0	0

We were there for 4 days and it was fun and all but the real deal was KFC. We don't have that where I'm from so it was close to the most important thing for almost the whole class. 

Anyway we all decided to pair up and split a 30 wing bucket. But since a lot of people in my class are rather small (myself included) we had a ton of leftovers. Being the good boys we are we decided to give the 30-40 wings we had left to a homeless person 

What we didn't know was that the polish was apparently very conservative. The man we gave it to seemed happy, but it's hard to tell. The polish boy in our class was quite mad at us because we gave the homeless dude our leftovers and I recently talked to my brother about it aswell.

But idk if I even want to or if I should and I’m just being a huge baby about it. Looking for insight. 

Anyways last night I had the biggest fight with my gf. She has a terrible habit of eating foods in bed, leaving crumbs around, and leaving occasional grease stains on the sheets. Last night I found her eating those baked potato skins in bed (she had a plate) while reading her phone. Later that night I was rolling around and felt BACON BITS stuck to the back of my neck, all greasy and sweaty. 

I sort of lost it and woke her up (this was like 1am). I said I told her so many times to take her food elsewhere but I’ve seriously had it. I’m going to sleep in the guest bedroom every time she eats in bed because I’m sick of pulling out chip bags from under the pillow or getting crumbs stuck to my body or rolling my face into sheets that smell vaguely of fries.

She got really upset and said she didn’t mean it and she forgets. But I tell her that every time she comes back with food I tell her to take it to the kitchen and she just rolls her eyes at me. She says fine, she’ll do it but she still thinks I’m overreacting.

Now time goes on, she stays round mine and she decides she wants sex, I ask if shes sure and I dont even know if shes single at this point.

We fuck around for a little while, admitted we had feelings for each other early on and then said we should do stuff when shes down (she lives in a few towns over). Due to this, I start talking less and less as we naturally see less of each other and just chat through IM. 

After a couple months of this goes by and then I start talking to another girl at my works, just casually and did not intend for anything to come of it. We talk all day every day, enjoy each others company and then admitting our feelings for each other and ended up sleeping with each other later on. There was a couple of months overlapping where I would have been sleeping with both, but I never admitted my feelings to both parties at the same time.

I'm a 39yo woman who owns a graphic/web design business with a good staff, so I have a lot of downtime. My sister has a wonderful 13yo who I adore and spend a lot of time with. Sister had an unexpected and complicated pregnancy, and our parents both passed away when we were teens, so they lived with me for the first 7ish years of her life, and they still have ""their rooms"" at my place. They live one block away.

I was briefly married, it ended very amicably. 13yo knows and loves him too. It's likely he will come back and settle down with me again, but his business took him all over the place and he felt weird being attached while being away for 6+ months at a time. I decided a long time ago that I didn't want kids, got myself fixed. I date occasionally (men & women), but it's never been a big thing for me. I love my life. 

About two weeks ago, 13yo and I were sitting on the patio. She started asking questions about me, my life, etc. They ranged from ""why don't you always shave your legs like mom does"" and ""why don't you have kids"" and ""when will you get married and have your own family?"" 

I gave her honest answers to each question that boiled down to: girl I just don't want to. That really surprised her, and she kept asking ""But don't you have to?"" and ""But everyone else does."" and ""but don't other people make fun of you?""

Finally, I told her something like, ""You don't always have to do what society tells you. Like yeah, you have to obey traffic laws, and don't go around being mean to people. But shaving? Nah. Getting married? Lot's of people don't! Having kids? You don't have to if *you* don't want to."" I then spouted some hippie ass bullshit about ""Your life belongs to you and you alone, don't ever let anyone pressure you to be someone you aren't. So if you WANT to shave your legs, don't let me change your mind. But know it's your choice.""

She became very contemplative about things, asked some more questions, but eventually she told me about school crushes and shit. 

I thought the conversation was totally fine until my sister came over and yelled at me for trying to turn her kid into some ""hairy lesbian"" who will never give her grandkids. I tried to explain that's not at all what I did but she completely blew up at me and told me they needed a break from me. They're usually over every few days or so, but it's been quiet.

bvwj1h	2019-06-02 11:43:59	PlebbySpaff	AITA for being annoyed with my friend over his complaining?	"I live with several people in an apartment, and one of them is my best friend. We hang out often and everything has been fine for a while now. However, we have a roommate that'll sometimes be annoying because he has a habit of making noises late at night. I don't have as much of a problem with the person myself because they seem nice in general and it just seems to be this night thing, but my friend just outright hates them.

This wasn't something that happened earlier in the year when we moved into this apartment, but now it's a fairly common thing, and my friend just complains about it every single day. Anytime the roommate comes home and goes up to his room, my friend will immediately start complaining about the person. We can just be hanging out, but the minute our roommate walks in and up to his room, my friend will just go off. It's gotten to a point where I'm actually annoyed by how often he complains about the person because they just go on tangents.

It seems worse because he's not actively doing anything to solve this problem. From what I know, he hasn't actually really talked to the roommate about these problems, and he hasn't actually attempted to talk to the person about the issue. Now all I'm getting is his complaints, when he could just as easily physically talk to the person instead of just complain about it.

AITA for getting annoyed by how he's acting? I mean we're in our 20s, and I expected that he'd at least attempt to have a conversation with the person, but as far as I know, he hasn't done it once."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I usually get home from work a bit earlier than my gf, but when she gets home she likes to come straight for a kiss and a hug. Then she likes to stroke my face (like cup my face in both her hands). I notice she doesn’t wash her hands and it’s a bit concerning to me because she takes multiple subway/buses home and she touches a lot of gross stuff, like railings, seats, etc. 

There’s also a dog that’s always hanging out in our apartment building and I know she pets him every time she comes home. 

AITA for asking her to wash her hands before she touches me, especially my face area? I shower every time I get home but even if she doesn’t I’d like her to wash her hands. She got really offended the last time I asked so now i don’t know what I should say."	Not the A-hole	0	0

There was this friend of mine (F18). We talked for a bit and then I asked her if she wants a drink. She was a bit drunk already but agreed. So we went to a bar and I made an order. While I was paying her cousin(F24) and her aunt(F40) came to a bar. I didn´t know who they are until this point. They took our shots and drink it. I looked at them and asked them what the fuck was that supposed to mean. I never experienced something like this in my life. The reaction of her aunt was very aggressive. She started screaming at me that I´m just a little kid (M18) and she is forty so she can do whatever she wants. I started to argue with her and ended up calling her a bitch. Couple of minutes later my friend comes to me and tells me that this was her aunt.

I met her yesterday and she seems to be really pissed at me. But I don´t feel like I did something wrong. They didn´t even offer to pay for those shots.

J is an utter and complete asshole. He posts about getting hard on Facebook constantly at everything and shares so much inappropriate stuff. But it’s his profile so I haven’t said anything to him about it. He does drugs, is constantly drunk, asks random girls if they’d blow him for 5 bucks, has cheated on her more times than he’s even probably even knows, is overall just a douchebag. A year and a half ago he got M pregnant and she gave birth to twins, she personally doesn’t use and has been a great mom to them so far. 

When M realized that J was a bad dad, wouldn’t help, would get mad at the kids for crying during one of his fb lives, she dumped him and moved in with me. I’ve been helping her take care of them and honestly I’ve grown close with them. J would try to get her back by stealing photos of them and posting them on his Facebook talking about how he changed one of their diapers and how one of them “said dada” even though the baby doesn’t even talk yet. He hasn’t even bothered to reach out to try to see them yet btw. 

A month ago I had to go back to my country (I study overseas) because my grandma passed. When I returned a week later I found that M had completely moved out. Checked J’s fb live and there she was: holding one of the kids while he smoked a cigarette nearby. I hadn’t gotten a single message from M about her moving out despite me asking her to care for my cat. My cat stayed for two days without food or water which I’m so mad about.

Would I be the asshole if I just deleted both their numbers/blocked them on everything and just never got in contact with any of them again? Me and M are honestly good friends but I just can’t stand him anymore. A part of me doesn’t wanna let go of the kids especially since it’s such a bad environment for them to live in but I don’t know what else I can do. It’s just so frustrating to me because I know when he cheats on her again in the next room I’m the one that’s gonna he called and cried to. I’m tired of it,"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bvw8ta	2019-06-02 11:00:36	Gorve1011	AITA for not wanting my friend to DM in D&D	"Hi guys, this is my first post so apologies in advance for any formatting issues. 

To give this some context. We have recently got a group of us together to do D&D. I organised this so I DM'd and recently ran and completed lost mines of phandelvor (LmoP) the starter campaign which ran a few months. After we agreed I would run storm kings thunder (SKT) then Rise of Tiamat. 

The issue is another player in the group and long time friend is also mad into D&D and likes to DM. He never said anything when we set the timeline out but after asked privately if he could run a different campaign. Waterdeep dragon heist. A very different style of campaign. Maybe once a month. To give me a break from DMing and let him do it. 

I had no issue with this so said as long as it doesnt disrupt my campaign and it's done on I do 4 sessions he does 1 split so the focus is mine then I have no problem with that and we brought it to the group and they agreed. 

So here is the problem. Now he tentatively posted in the group chat saying how should we split the sessions up. Bearing in mind we have had this conversation already. He asked if I would be ok with a 2/2 or a 3/2 mine to his ratio would be ok and I straight up said no. We agreed 4/1. So he then calls me up and again asks how do we want to split it and would I be ok letting him continue with his campaign if it ends in an awkward place where it makes sense to keep going next week. 

So I said no thats not ok. Part of being a DM is managing things so that doesnt happen. I get in this random shit happens where you just cant plan it but if you think it's going to lead somewhere where you will want to continue end the session early so we can pick up the session in a month time.  Likewise I will use my 4 sessions to make sure we leave on cliff hangers that can be picked up again after his. 

He then got a bit pissed off with me and said he would just ask the group what they thought when we next all meet up.

Sooooo... I have known this girl since we were little kids. We weren't super close or anything, I was just friends with her brother so we just kinda knew eachother.  


Five years ago we started becoming more close because we attended the same school, but the real friendship started this year. We started hanging out with our mutual friends etc, I started to like her but nothing really serious. At one point one of my friends actually told me I should go for it and ask her on a date but I told him she was just a friend, almost like a sister, so I didn't care that much about her in that aspect.

A couple of months ago she got a boyfriend, who is a friend of mine. I've known this guy for years, we hang out together, played vidya sometimes. Not really the closest friend, but I like him, he's a good guy.  


**Now comes the problem.**

This guy lives in another town, not too far away but that still means that the girl doesn't see him every day.   
As a matter of fact this girl and I became best friends: I talked to her about how cool this guy was, how I thought they were a great match etc. We started hanging out more to the point that for the past 2 weeks we would hang out alone if the guy wasn't in town. Talking about life, problems, shit and stuff.  


I think I'm catching some feelings for her. I don't know what to do.  


She tells me that she is happy when she is with me, she doesn't think about her problems, that I'm the only one she trusts with her ""secret problems"". She even told me once that if we wouldn't have ""grown up together"" we would probably be dating right now.  


What do I do? Do I stop going out with her and take away her only best friend? Do I tell her I have feelings for her?  
It seems like being the asshole is inevitable, either way I'm gonna make her life worse.

bvw5bh	2019-06-02 10:45:36	StixxyTape	Wibta for changing the password to my sister's computer?	"So a bit of background. A couple of months ago my sister(16F) decided to move her gaming computer worth about 2k into our attic. Our attic however is split into two rooms. A big one and a small one, and I(12M) am sleeping in the small room, while the computer is in the big room. 

My brother(8M), John (fake name), is kind of a gaming addict. On weekends he'd get up at 7:00-7:30 to play roblox on it for a couple of hours. This usually wakes me up, but I don't really mind. The part that annoys me is that later in the day, I would usally start playing from around 12:00 to 12:30. 

But during the middle of my gaming session he'd complain to our sister about how he hadn't played at all and she'd kick me off the computer. She even changed the password once and told John, but not me. (I found it out later though).

I can't think of anything to do apart from changing the password and telling neither of them about it. WIBTA if I did?

bvw51p	2019-06-02 10:44:27		AITA For cutting off a friend I thought was being Toxic?	"This happened about me (25m) about a month ago but it's been on my mind and I'm unsure if I overreacted or not. I'll try to be as brief as I can without being vague.

So I moved to a new city recently and I've been desperately trying to find friends. I ended up meeting someone on Tinder. We got to know each other and kinda become FWB inadvertently. Neither of us had the intention to be in a relationship. 

Fast forward a month and she tells me she may be developing feelings for me. I told her I wasn't really sure about being in a relationship but I'd be willing to continue to get to know her and see where it goes. A few days later we were hanging out and she told me she cut everyone else off that she was talking to from Tinder which I thought was maybe pushing things too quickly, although I didn't say that. I told her I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do. After that she pretty much got quiet for the remainder of the time we were out and said she needed to go home early. I asked her what was wrong but she wouldn't give me a solid answer.

The next day I texted her and asked what was wrong again because it's evident based on how she acted I said something that upset her. She told me she felt stupid for cutting everyone off. I told her I kinda wish she just voiced her opinion when we were together so we could talk about it and also told her I felt she was rushing things. She stopped replying to me and the next day said she needed time alone.

For whatever reason she didn't talk to me for a week. When we started talking again we agreed to be friends and made plans the next day to go see Endgame because we were both excited to see it. She ended up cancelling because she said she didn't feel good and rescheduled to the next day. 

I sent a text basically saying alright talk to you tomorrow etc never got a reply back. Next day comes around, it's about 9:30pm-10pm and she still hasn't responded and I see her Snapchat story and she was hanging out with some guy that day so clearly she was feeling well enough to be out.

So basically I called her out and told her I didn't want to be friends anymore because I feel like she ditched me and was really bad at communicating her feelings. Those were red flags for me among other things I didn't mention.

She told me I was overreacting and she did plan on hanging out with me, she told me she was going to text meater. But it was about 10pm. We're going to both take a 40min train ride at 10pm to watch a movie and get out at like 1am? I don't think so. She made me feel bad though and I'm not sure if I overreacted or not."		1	0

My friend moved in with us - my mom, my grandmother, my grandfather, and myself - last year when his mother moved across the country. He's been my friend for roughly eight years now. We fully accepted him and he is part of the family, completely. There is zero treatment difference. About six months ago, his mother died. This info will be important in a minute. 

I'm in university, but I'm doing it online because I can't get to a physical class. For unrelated reasons I planned to pull a double all-nighter, and for one day I was going to sit in a timmies for what came to 17-ish hours. He insisted on going with me. Part of the reason I wanted to go to the shop in the first place was because he often interrupts my studying and then stays in my room and talks constantly. But I didn't want to be rude, I said okay. 

We get there, and it turns out that he doesn't have the money to actually buy food or anything past a couple of drinks. I couldn't let him sit there for 17 hours with nothing, so I let him use my card. However, he bought things without my approval. They were little things, cheap like a single cookie, but I budget to the third decimal place and he *knows* that. He knows that I'm careful with money, and I was already spending way more than I wanted so he could have food and drinks on the trip he insisted on going on. 

Then came the talking. For 17 hours he talked constantly. I got through 2 and a half chapters of my psyc book. That's nothing considering the time I was there. I even took a quiz and he kept on talking, even though I made it clear that I was taking a quiz and I needed quiet. Every 15 minutes he said I should take a break, but I was only ever able to half focus because he wouldn't stop talking. 

But the reason I'm worried I'm the asshole here is because of what the last year has been for him, hence the background at the start. He lost his step father, who was a genuine father figure, months before, then had to move in with us, and then lost his mother. I can only imagine how hard that is. 

I'm worried that I'm overreacting or being insensitive, so I thought I'd ask the internet.

I’m moving out of our house at the start of July and I wanted to keep helping him till I left so that he’d be in the best place. 

He’s such a douche when I’m trying to help him and makes it really hard to stay motivated. He keeps saying I’m doing it so I don’t feel guilty if something bad happens to him when I go. I don’t think I have anything to feel guilty about cause I poured my heart and soul into helping him for the last year and a half and it’s taken a huge toll on me.

I have mental health issues too so it’s hard. I’m working away three days a week, and running the house with no help from him. Looking after the dog who’s not being walked whilst I’m gone. Coming home to a mess usually and him on drink/drugs.

I’m trying to help him get set up for when I go since I own most of the stuff in the house (that I’ve saved and bought over the years) and pass the bills on to him (I need him to be there to consent, give paperwork) so that he doesn’t need to set up new accounts, I know he doesn’t know where to start.

My gf and I haven't had sex for a while, we are working adults and dont live together, it happens. No big deal. Well we have a great night, booze, food, and finally sex. During sex, she is much more tame than normal. We have a fairly kinky sex life, I wont go into too much detail but we enjoy doing some left field stuff. So during sex I kinda move towards the more kinky things (focused on me), which she is not receptive to. That's fine, I can respect keeping it vanilla for an evening. Well long story short, she basically tells me that I have to cum missionary style while having sex with her. I am used to our normal kinky stuff, so it is very hard for me to get off like that. Not impossible, but it takes a while and my gf usually ends up getting sore after we do it that way. Well, I do finish and then it is her turn. 

She starts dictating everything, telling me how she wants to cum and this and that. Going as far as just moving what she wanted where she wanted with no communication. She didn't let me do what I want to do, which is fine because it is her turn and it's more for her than me anyways.

After we finish, we are laying there and I just asked her why I wasn't allowed to ""call the shots"". She asked what I meant and I said that she had gotten to do what she wanted and I asked why she wasn't receptive to the stuff I was moving towards. She starts going off about how i'm over analyzing and should think about how I brought up the conversation. I really dont think there was a better way to bring it up than just asking. I am and always have been straight forward.

It made me feel guilty for wanting the things I did, especially when she only wanted me to cum in missionary. She doesn't see my side, and we aren't talking right now.

So I got this ticket for an event, which was yesterday, but goes over the whole weekend. You could get tickets for each single day though. There are tickets for earlier entrance, which cost 25€ and normal ones for 15€. I bought the early access one.

A few weeks ago I got the opportunity to work at this event, which I happily agreed to.
Because of that I don't need my ticket anymore, and I posted online that I am selling it.
A friend of me approached me yesterday morning, so a few hours prior to the event, that she will come with her bf and will take the ticket, but since they don't need early access, what would the price be? I thought I probably won't be able to sell it anywhere else, so we agreed on 12€ and she would give it to me in cash later.
I sent her the ticket and deleted my online posts about selling the ticket.
Very late in the evening, i thought they probably were already there, she wrote me that because of issues with their bus travel they wouldn't make it in time/only for 1hr and it wouldn't be worth the money.

I realised that she didn't intend to give me the money for the ticket and didn't answer to it.

We hadn't made reservations and there were 5 of us so we knew it would be a bit of a pain but we asked at the restaurant and they managed to fit us in at a shared table with a couple who were being seated at the same time. We all place orders at the same time and the appetizers for both groups came out at the same time. After finishing appetizers the couple next to us receives their main courses. Since there are 5 of us and we are ordering different things we know it will be a bit of a wait but that was fine. We continue to wait as the couple finishes their main course and moves on. No one comes to check in on us but regularly stop at the tables around us. At this point, we have been waiting for an hour. The crazy thing is, this restaurant is a hot plate concept meaning that they bring you raw meat and a hot plate and you cook the meat on your own plate. We have now been waiting an hour for raw meat and some pasta. Since I can't flag anyone down I go up to talk to the staff. I ask how long it will be and they go back and forth with the cooks before telling me another 10-15 minutes (our theory is that they misplaced our order or forgot). They ask if they can bring us anything while we wait. After consulting with my group I tell them that we would just like to cancel our order and I offer to pay for our appetizers. The lady throws her hands up and me and flips her notebook to our page crossing everything out dramatically and tells us to go ahead and leave. I've never left a restaurant without eating before and felt SO awkward. I can't stop thinking about how bad I feel for taking up table space and leaving like that. So AITA?	Not the A-hole	0	0

Im passionate about my culture and after i learned the shitty things she said to my mom and dad when they were getting married, i cut off all contact with her, my older brothers still got christmas/birthday gifts etc, but i never did, my brothers were always getting to vacation with her but i never got invited, and it was only confirmed after she got drunk at a family gathering one time, and told me and my mom, too our faces, she wished i was never born, and never brought into her ""pure white"" family.

Me and Jim had a great relationship that lasted 8 months, we were each other's first everything. We ended our relationships little over 2 months ago. Fair. I was heartbroken and so was he, but we wished each other the best and we were ok with each other. 

About month ago, I started dating a guy and I told Frida, and she was happy for me. Me and this guy (22M, let's call him Nick) and the chemistry is amazing. Frida was very happy for me.

5 days ago, Frida texts me and says that she's not 100% sure she's gay, because she's gotten sexual feelings for a guy. I tell her that sexuality can change and that it's okay. The following part is how our conversation went through text:
Me: who is it?
Frida: just an old friend.
Me: pic?
Frida: .. it was a big fat lie.
Me: uhm okay, who is it then?
Frida: don't be mad, it's Jim. We were at a party and he told me that I had a great body that he something thought about when he was ""beating the meat"", and I don't know, I just really want to fuck him.
Me:...... what?
Frida: don't be mad, I know there's not gonna be anything between him and I, I'm overthinking things and being desperate.
Me: It's just weird. I love you, and since there's not gonna be anything between you it's ok. Don't worry

I felt strange, and weird because she told me, but I wasn't mad at all. I just didn't really have the need to know she was thirsty for my ex.

Here on Friday, she casually texts me this (shortened the conversation down a lot)
Frida: I fucked Jim.
Me: what? 
Frida: don't be mad, I only did it to see if I was 100% a lesbian and he was ok with it. And we were drunk.
Me: You fucked my ex and think it's okay? 
Frida: well it was just sex and it was only to see if I'm gay. I don't regret it but I wouldn't have done it if I knew you were gonna be upset
Me: upset? I'm mad as fuck, how could you think it's okay? We broke up 2 MONTHS AGO?!
Frida: I thought it was okay because you said you weren't mad when I had sexual feelings for him, and you're dating Nick now 
Me: that's a shitty excuse. Do whatever you want, I don't care. It's your life, but don't expect me to NOT get upset when my best friends stabs me in the back.
Frida: I had no idea you'd get so upset. Can you forgive me? You're not gonna tell anyone are you?
Me: I'm pissed, and you were being a selfish asshole. And yes of course am I gonna tell someone, I have the right to talk to people about shit that makes me this angry. 


I haven't talked to her since, it's been a couple of days. I feel guilty, I'm not sure if I accidentally made her think it was ok by telling her I wasn't mad when she had sexual feelings for him? Could I have overreacted? He's my ex, I haven't had any contact with him for 2 months? Please help, I want to know if I'm being an asshole and a drama queen here."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bvvvfx	2019-06-02 10:01:41	megan282	AITA for wanting sister's fiancee to chip in for my dad's birthday present?	"Hello, my first post here. This is eating me up for a while.

My dad is turning 50 this year. As my sister was always closer with dad, she found a gift and I think he would enjoy it. It is Pranamat mat + pillow (set costs 160 eur). To me it's big money for *something you're not entirely sure if item will be used*. I even offered to get just the mat (for 100) and if he likes it and actually uses it, get the pillow for Christmas (80 eu, because no set discount). But I ended up agreeing on getting the 160 eur set.

Okay so, my sister is in steady 8 years relationship (engaged for over a year)(25F and 25M). They're living separately and from us (I still live with parents(24 F)). In general, when it's his parents birthday- they always buy presents together. I also have a boyfriend, but it's a LDR and not even a year together, we obviously aren't there yet- I am not getting his parents birthday gifts and also he will not be able to go to my dads party since he lives in another country.

And a conversation went like this.

*Sister*: ""so ill give you 80 eur then"" (i ordered)

*Me*: ""wait, but what about \*her fiancee\*. He is also coming to party. You guys both buy gifts always. You together earn double than I do alone""

*Sister*: But our money is in one budget. You also have a boyfriend.

Mkaaaay so I ended up just nodding it off, but couldn't help myself feeling hurt. My sister kept on asking the next day why I am so not talkative and I said I feel like they are scamming me. Then she said ""if you can't afford it, you know you can always just give even nothing and we say its from 3 of us"". But I don't. It wasn't about the money *at this point*\- I would even pitch in 200 EACH as long as we know *some amazing gift that dad would absolutely love*. But I was hurt that two people, who make double amount of money, want to share with me 50/50 instead of 66/33. I felt scammed by my own family. My mom took sister's side saying ""it's only your dad with sister so you shouldn't even bring the fiancee in this. If you don't like the offer, next time just buy your own gift"". But why shouldn't I bring fiancee in this? Sister does pitch in to fiancee's parents birthday presents, so why can't the fiancee pitch in in our dad gift? Especially, when he's going to attend the party?

My sister lost her nerve, called me and asshole and that all I care about is money, gave me the difference (making it 66/33) and closed the subject. I am still not happy because I know she did it to end argument. She still feels right for 50/50 and I still feel like she was wrong and I want wholeheartedly admit it. Also, if she was poor or something, I would be able to cover the 100% and say it's from 3 of us. But we are both doing similar (two of them salaries are like mine doubled). So it's not about cheapskating, it's about 3 people but dividing costs into 50/50.

So am I the asshole here?

(Also please don't be too mean it's a sensitive topic for me.) Thanks!"	Asshole	0	0
bvvv0i	2019-06-02 10:00:06	spyewker	AITA for hooking up with my friend's brother and not telling her	"Okay, so this started about four years ago when I was 16. I had a friend who I was fairly close to, like not bff status, but we hung out pretty regularly. This friend had a really hot older brother who was 2 years older than us. Long story really short, he and I ended up sleeping together at least once a week. He specifically asked me not to tell anyone as his relationship with his dad was already strained and he was concerned about how his rather conservative family would react to finding out he was gay. I agreed to keep it hush hush and we carried on regularly hooking up for about a year and a half til I went to uni and were still doing so occasionally whenever I was back home until recently.

Somehow my friend found out. She and I haven't been as close as we used to be for a while. We didn't really fall out, just drifted apart for a number of reasons. She called me the other day furious that I didn't ever tell her about he and I. She said that I lied and betrayed her trust, that I was never any friend to her and she's no interest in being friends with me from here on out. I'm devastated at the loss of a friend and yes I lied, but only by omission and for what I believe was the greater good (i.e. not outing her brother). I'm conflicted on if I'm right or not."

bvvuci	2019-06-02 09:57:03		AITA for accepting my mom’s advances?	"My mom is a saint, after my dad died she raised me by herself and worked 3 jobs not even having time for herself while raising me. I didn’t want her to suffer because of me anymore so I moved out when I turned 17 and only contacted her a small amount so she could live her life without worrying about me. I’ve hit a rough patch in life recently so I asked her if I could move back in with her for a few months and she said yes and I was super apologetic for just up and leaving.

Anyway I’ve been living with her now for a few weeks and I’ve noticed something strange. Mom walks around the house naked, something she would never do around me, I chalked this up to mom being used to me not being around so I didn’t say anything but as time went on I noticed that she would do strange things like do yoga topless in when I was in the living room or leave out her ‘toys’ where I would see them. I think I finally had enough and confronted her. She admitted to me that I looked exactly like my father and that she hadn’t had a relationship with any man since he died. She then told me how she loved me more than a son and I told her that if she wasn’t my mother maybe I would feel the same but that fact is I cannot and will not cross that line. 

She got mad called me an asshole and hasn’t talked to me since. This was  2 nights ago and I’ve been thinking, she raised me alone while asking for nothing in return should I have just given in? I’ve only ever been useless and maybe I could’ve done something for her but I just can’t cross the line with her, so AITA?"		1	0
bvvtvb	2019-06-02 09:54:42	Throwawayco-workers4	WIBTA if I asked my co-workers to speak English?	"So first off I’m on my phone.


I also have no problem with people speaking different languages in front of me. Sometimes I think it’s cool to hear different landowners how people say things.

The only problem is with my two co-workers. One of them if a third generation Mexican-American and the other is two. So  them speaking English is no problem, they both don’t have slick accents and etc.

The whole is ever since my second co-worker started. When we work they will only speak Spanish to each other.

They will say they are discussing work which is bs because of them has thus annoying laugh which is  annoying and loud.  When our boss (who is actually from Russia) comes around. 

They tell her they already discussed as a group what they are going to do next. I am like “um no I don’t know what’s going on.”

My co-workers were like,” Well we  spoken about it already.”

And they don’t tell me details while my boss tells me,” I need to pay attention more.”

And sometimes they will tell me things in Spanish and say “got it?”

I am lucky because I have another co-worker who was born in Mexico. He will tell me everything they say, or tells me I don’t know want to know what they said.

Luckily I only have to deal these ladies on the weekends. But right now I work at a college where we are all cleaning dorms as a group. So I am seeing them more than just the weekend now.

My weekday boss told me  not to ignore them and just find work to do.

Because my weekend is really passionate about her immigrant employees.

I am just sick of getting in trouble because of them and I want to ask them to speak English or go to HR about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Fast forward, I am getting married next year, so after finalising we decided to have a small pre-wedding party. She outrightly said that she won't be able to attend after pretending that she woulf be wearing this and that. I asked her what is the reason, she said that it's time she manages her finances wisely and now it is money vs my pre-wedding party. I offered to pay for her expenses and said that if it hurts your pride she can take it as a loan and pay me whenever but she said no. She said that this party isn't that important according to her, I mean come on it's only a pre-wedding and her presence would be mentally there if not physically. I was totally hurt by this and then also said that even though it's just a party all the people I love are going to be there and since she's on top of the list I need here there. She said she isn't coming. Moreover she altered the previous line of mine and said that I want here there just because the others are coming. I never said that. 

After this, I got hurt and said do whatever you want and didn't include her in any preparations and didn't wish her luck for an overseas trip(not paid by her). I am not that kind of person who can just be normal and cheerful after someone said- this isn't important according to me, so I won't be coming. 

So i didn't talk to her for a few days and CALLED her again for formally inviting her. 


She went ballistic on me saying that i made her feel small and little by not including her in the party(which she said isn't important) preparations and asking about the dresses etc. Just because I ain't coming to the party, I don't deserve this treatment in any world. I said this isn't about you coming to the party now, this is about how you handled that. She said- 'First you did wrong by not accepting maturely the decision that I am not coming to your party'. Then you did wrong by putting this petty issue(pre-wedding) above all and ignoring asking about my advice as well as my well being'. 

AITA?

TLDR: I am doubtful that this friendship is toxic but she makes me feel that I am the wrong one by being petty about her not coming to my pre-wedding party."	Asshole	1	0
bvvrjh	2019-06-02 09:44:03	Yeushsnxn	AITA for “stealing” food?	"Throwaway because my sOn girlfriend has reddit.

For some context, I live with my husband, kids, and my son and his girlfriend (who pays me rent of course).

Anyway to the story. My son and his girlfriend (well call her Emily) buy all of their own food. I provide the food for my husband and 2 other kids. Emily and my son usually have dinner by themselves (our schedules differ) but I will regularly invite them to have dinner with the family, Emily is very appreciative of this. Here’s where the problem arises... my kids called me once that they were hungry and didn’t know what to eat, I was at work so I just told them it’s ok to take Emily’s food. This was a month ago and apparently, Emily is now pissed because I’ve been letting my kids “steal” her food. I believe I am doing no wrong, I think it’s fair that I get a portion of her food if she gets a portion of mine (arguably more). She says it doesn’t matter you should ask before taking. My son is defending her. I told her If she doesn’t like my kids having her food then I will no longer be inviting her to dinner. I don’t believe she understands how difficult it is to raise and feed two children.

"So a bit of background, My Boyfriend and I got together in April one of his best friends had sorta liked me too before that, but is  like a brother to my boyfriend and respected mine and my now bfs decisions. 

This friend of has invited me to a couple of friend get together a, I pretty much know most of bf's friends group by now, I would instantly message my bf and let him know and ask if he'd want to come. His answer usually a no. So last night the same friend asked me and I messaged my BF when I was on the fence about going and then let him know I would be, he was happy I told and stuff, but his best bud did not invite bf. 

I didn't know this until bf told me I just assumed that obviously he would be invited, even if he was not going to come, weekends are usually fam time for him. 

I told him if he wants I can also not go, but he was insistent that if I wanted to I go.

Anyway I went and chilled, it was peaceful, no idiots and everyone was respectful. However, the fact that my BF wasn't invited hurt him and I don't really know how to help. I'm not sure if he is mad at me, but no indications up until now.

TLDR: Got invited out by BF's friends, BF did not."	No A-holes here	1	0

"I'm 24 years old female who lives in another apartment from my parents but due to my grandfather's death, I decided to live with my parents for a few months. My dad was broken and my mom couldn't handle him. They're both working and mom often needs help with the housework. My father never helps and my mom is too stubborn, so she doesn't hire someone to help her with the house even though they can easily afford one.

I'm a master degree student and I worked really hard in this year. I was super stressed, my seminar was ahead and I was also quite sad about my grandpa's death. All in all, I'm not really doing well psychologically. However I tried to stand strong and help my mother. Even though I didn't always do the housework because I had to study, I did all I can.

There's Ramadan ahead and yesterday my mom asked me to clean up. I was back from doctor, there was yet again another sickness due to stress and I answered her that I will do but tomorrow. I wasn't feeling well and I wanted to rest a little. She's a woman who doesn't like when we don't do the things she said right away. To her, we always have to do as we're told right in that moment. I often avoid arguing and do things that she asked for her sake but yesterday I just didn't feel like it. When I first told her no, at first she didn't say anything but as the day past, she kept bringing it up, kept nagging. I pouted because she didn't stop talking and she got mad after I pouted. She said I don't have the rights to do that. I said, ""ok, so you can say whatever you want and I have to hold my tongue. At least let me show some emotion."" But she said I can't pout because I am wrong. I didn't answer further because I didn't want to hurt her but even after the dinner, I heard her complaining to my father. I got mad but I didn't say anything to her. I just went straight to sleep.

She does that all the time. Like only her feelings and works matter. I have to do as I'm told and I have to do it in that exact moment. And she always manages to make me feel bad and guilty after we argued. I don't know. Am I the asshole for not helping my mom? Or am i right? Am I acting childish? Or is she acting like a child?"

bvvk0s	2019-06-02 09:09:39	UnggaTongga	AITA for being mad at my SO because she stayed overnight to her male friend's house?	"So last night, they had a gathering with her friends at this guy's house.

She said that she won't be staying up late because we have a trip tomorrow morning.

I never disapproved of her meeting with her friends, because they were in her life first before me.

So they had few drinks (not sure if its few), and became drunk (obviously).

A few hours later, her other friends we're leaving because of several reasons, but she chose to stay because the guy friend was alone and lonely, then she say she was sleepy. And I just knew about this in the morning. (Well, you don't expect me to continually bug her all night while she was with her friends, right? So I slept while all of those were happening)

When I asked her about it, she told me that she wasn't alone with the guy, then on the next time I asked her, she was with her friend, and in the next time i asked her, only one of them out of 6 left. I found it inconsistent so I just kinda get mad. So I confronted her about it, and told her what I feel... that she should've just tell me that she'll be overnight so the trip for tomorrow won't be scheduled, and she had a choice to come with her friends who were leaving that night.

And she's getting mad at me now because I didn't go to her house when she got home for that trip. Well, if I did come and pursued the trip, it will not go well because I am still pissed that she managed to label me as the ""villain"" of the story. It's as like I am slowly become guilty because I got mad. 

So, I got mad. But she got mad too. Saying that I was just spouting nonsense, and it should not be big deal. I dunno, if I am in the wrong with this one. AITA for being mad at her?

I wanted y’alls opinion on this matter. I’ve been talking to this guy for a very long time (since last November or so). We met in person twice before he flew to another state to finish his degree, where he recently came back to where I’m living currently. Since he left to finish college in January, we literally texted every single day and not a day went by where we haven’t messaged each other. Long story short, we developed a deep connection. 

Since he’s been back early May though, he hasn’t made a huge effort to see me. We saw each other once when I picked him up from the airport (during my finals week) and then I went on vacation for two weeks after. While I was gone, he told me how he’d take me to this church the Sunday I came back and we made plans to do so. 

The Sunday I arrive, he literally tells me hours prior to church “Sorry I can’t make it, I’ll be far away.” I was super hurt and offended but didn’t want to blow up at him because we aren’t dating yet. I just told him “ok no worries” but ever since then I’ve been resentful and my heart hasn’t really been in it anymore. I still care for him deeply but I’m forcing myself to move on because he really disappointed me. 

I do realize he’s in a tough spot right now because he’s technically homeless (he’s been crashing between two friends’ place), doesn’t even have a car yet and hasn’t gotten a corporate job yet. He’s saving up money currently for his own place and car and he’s staying at a friend’s place which is an hour away. So I know it’s difficult for him.

Anyways, he messaged me an hour ago asking me if I wanted to go to church with him tomorrow. WIBTA if I told him “I’m not willing to get flaked on again, so I’m going to pass on that. Sorry” and not really make an effort to talk to him again?"	Asshole	1	0

bvvd3h	2019-06-02 08:36:36	IamSando	WIBTA for putting a deposit down on a house without telling my GF of a (potential) risk?	"So I'm looking to buy a house with my GF. For context I'm putting in a large amount of the cost (~75%) and we're taking out a loan for the rest. We currently live apart and have completely separate finances, although that will change once we have a place. We currently have pre-approval for a lot more than we need, although we do not have a formal loan approval.

Where I am, the process is that we put down a 0.25% deposit, which we did yesterday. We then have 7 business days to organise all the building inspections etc before we have to put down the rest of the 10% deposit. Then typically in 6 weeks you settle the remaining amount. It's this typical 6 weeks that is throwing a spanner in the works, since due to some weirdness with local govt, that could be anywhere from 6 weeks to 4 months that the settlement could occur.

I've paid the 0.25%, and I will pay the remaining 9.75% of the deposit. The issue is that whilst we have pre-approval, we don't yet have formal loan approval and we might not by the 7 days. So I may be putting the whole 10% down with no loan backing me up.

I should be clear, the chances of not getting a loan are basically 0. The bank(s) are incredibly likely to see my current earnings (they go off my previous years tax returns) and be fine with it, and even if they're not, our tax season ends June 30 and my earnings this year become assessable and I've earned 2.5x what I did last year. So all things considered, this is an incredibly safe risk, but hey I'm an analyst and just cause it's less than 1% doesn't mean it'll never happen.

My current plan is that if I don't have the formal approval (note I'll back out if I get rejected, this is just if I hear nothing) to just go through with the full deposit. But I don't plan on explaining this small risk to my GF. She's the absolute epitome of a stress-head, and this will make her freak out waaaaaaay beyond what is reasonable for the situation.

It's my money, if this was our money I'd tell her. But then we're moving in together and planning on getting married, so it very soon will be ""our"" money. Am I wrong to hide this from her? I realise her stress isn't healthy and we're working on it, but I think the momentous nature of this would be too much for her at this stage. She's at 0% risk of losing any of ""her"" money as well, I'm risking ""my"" money."	Asshole	0	0

I think I am part a- hole in this story but I need to know if I am a complete A-Hole. 

I had a conference I paid for to go to yesterday, have been talking about it for 2 months. Would be good for freebies, some great Professional Development and just networking. 

He booked a job to do Saturday morning, but promised he would be back to take kids to sport at 9:30, so he would be back by 9. So I rearranged everything and was able to get to where I needed to be by 9:45 if he got home at 9. I would miss maybe 15 minutes of it and usually they start late anyway. 

9 am rocks around, nothing, no call no text it' cheeping crickets. Try calling him at 9:15, kids are ready, I'm ready to head out and we are waiting..... 9:20, still nothing call again phone rings out. 

So I am now taking kids to sport..... Finally 10 an I send a text, asking g if he's dead or something - 15 minutes later I finally get a reply "" sorry didn't realise phone flat switched off on way home"" 

No other mention of what I was going to do nothing. By this time it was too late to go, even if he came to get the kids it wouldn't have been till half past 10 or later, I would have gotten into the conference maybe by 11:30/ midday - parking would have been hell and super expensive and I had missed all the seminars I wanted to see. 

So we get home and before I could say anything a random friend turns up, I have never met them in the 10 years we have been together. I don't know what they we're doing but it was Hinkey and now I'm pissed because I had been excited to go and he completely dismisses me. When I pull him up on it he gets offensive and we don't speak for the rest of the day. His friend didn't leave till 6 ish and that's after suddenly we are now storing his stuff under our house, so he also goes help him get it. 

This morning we don't talk until he demands to know what's happening with kids sport today. U tell him I will take them again and ask why he's being aggressive 

He starts telling at me that he's pissed because I blamed him for me not going to conference yesterday. I should have told him to come pick up kids and go. It's not his fault blah blah blah. 

I'm trying to get to see that it's not the conference but the complete disregard of me, our whole relationship I have been at his beck and call. He's never really had to take responsibility for anything besides having a job. I do all the banking, all the school, kid stuff all the household ect. 

I came back from sport and told him I shouldn't have blamed it all on him. But I am so pissed he won't take any responsibility for just not caring about something that was important to me. I am sure he actually doesn't know anything about it, even though I have been talking about it for so long. 

I feel like shit because out kids can feel the tension and I just so pissed off by his complete ignorance. Sometimes he makes me feel worthless...."	Not the A-hole	0	0

They've never approved of me before our wedding and after the wedding we kind of kept it courteous. But living with them for months is unimaginable.

bvva0g	2019-06-02 08:21:15		AITA for wanting my boyfriend to change his looks and do more in life than gaming?	"To start with this: I have a very sweet boyfriend and I really love him so I actually feel very guilty about this. 

We are together now for 1,5 years and thinking about moving in together, but something is really holding me back.

Excuse my English in advance, I am from Italy, tried the best I could.

&#x200B;

My problem is that I am occasionally ashamed of him. Almost the only thing he does in his life is gaming and you can see that in his face (eyes).

He also does not dress well and he does not know the meaning of the word 'sport' or 'gym' (he is not fat, but not exactly fit either). 

Also he is not that handsome, so i.m.h.o he can at least put on something nice and exercise a little, right? Do the best you can with what you are given?

I am a beautiful woman to see and try to do as much as possible in life and men find me more than interesting (i know how that sounds, but it's the truth). 

I really love him, but I also like to look at someone who takes care of himself.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I want to leave him because I have the feeling that he is not doing his best to keep such a beautiful woman. 

Because I think there are men around who have more to offer. That sounds so bad and I'm ashamed of myself. 

But I feel like I give him more than he gives me, meaning I look better and do more, so I make his world 'bigger' and all I get back is this gamer guy. He doesn't have any friends either, only the online ones.

&#x200B;

He doesn't know anything about this, only sometimes I drop a hint about clothing or sports, but he doesn't care how he looks (that's his respond).

I doubt whether he is the one who needs to change or me. Maybe he is right? But I just... I can't lose this feeling. 

&#x200B;

I don't know if anything will change if you tell me I am the asshole, or he is. But at least it will be one thought less. 

I just can't lose this feeling that I want/have to be proud at my man."		1	0

bvv9cp	2019-06-02 08:18:12	throwingawayallofit_	WIBTA- for potentially getting a doctor's note	"Backstory: I currently work third shift and have been on it for a majority of the last couple of years. Recently, the hours have started to affect me physically and mentally. More days than not I feel physically ill or wake up feeling sick. If I get enough sleep I still feel exhausted during the day. I've started to have more anxiety flare ups and more depressive episodes. I've tried sleeping at different times, right when I get off, and staying up and going to bed later. I've used vacation days and sick days just to get breaks from work. I've tried almost everything at this point but nothing seems to work. 

When I first started feeling it affect me I went to my manager and told him my concerns and that I was also starting to feel burned out. We talked for a bit and decided that if another shift became available that I could move to it. Fast forward a couple weeks and a swing shift (splits first and second) is available but goes to the supervisor. Before all that was final he called me in and talked to me and explained the reasoning which I was okay with, but stated he would work with me on the next one that was available. A couple weeks go by and I notice there is no more swing shift, and that there was a spot on first shift that was available. Well, it had already been filled with someone less senior than me and I wasn't talked to about it or asked if I wanted it. 

I go in again and talk to my manager and say that since that shift is available I wanted to use my seniority to take it, which is stated in our policy. I was told, again, that: I am too valuable, I'm too good at what I do, and other things that are good to hear but don't help. I'm also told that the person who is on first shift can go to nights because it causes grief with the family, and the newest person can't go either otherwise they would ""quit"", even though they have no seniority to pick their shift. 

I have a doctor's appointment coming up and was planning on talking to him about my concerns and how I feel the shift is affecting my health. I feel like I'm not the asshole because I'm just trying to take my health seriously and prevent issues from getting any worse. 

So, WIBTA for talking with my doctor and potentially getting a doctor's note stating that I can't work nights because it is affecting my physical and mental health, thus moving me to first shift?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Turns out it was mine, then I knew it was because of the group chat from my colleagues so I played it like it was a secret she shouldn't be aware of for a bit then showed her the messages. 

After that she asked for my fingerprint and I refused laughing, but she insisted and wouldn't let go of it so I stopped playing and said no. Obviously she thought I had things to hide. It is true in parts because I do have on my phone conversations with my best friend with who sometimes I rant about my gf and that kind of things or selfies of my that I'm not secure about (workouts progression pics), even internet history porn which I'd rather not share.

All in all she said she just wanted to do some prank not go through it but it makes me really uncomfortable to let her handle it.

I think it is my private space which should stay private. I understand that she thinks I'm hidding things from her but in the same time I don't want to sacrifice my privacy and start really hidding my conversations with said best friend and clear history and delete photos because she feel insecure.

I don't know how to tell her that, she only sees the something to hide aspect and we're a bit cold because of this incident right now.

My parents decided to pick up their since passed parents names (pop pop and mimi) to use for the baby, however my MIL has been undecided. 

Now mind you there is PLENTY of time to figure this out and no need to land on something right in this moment.

I have one living grandparent. She goes by ‘mum mum’. This will be her 13th great grand child.

So last night I’m with my MIL and in the midst of general conversation she says to my husband and I, ‘So I was thinking, I really don’t want to use ‘nana’ (her mother’s name), but I was thinking of using ‘mum mum’, I know that’s what your grandmother uses but when will we ever really be around together?’

I kind of just stared off into open space and said ‘Hey yeah there is plenty of time to think about it and pick a name....’

Like really, her logic is she doesn’t feel comfortable using her deceased mothers name but she is OK to use the name that the only living matriarch of my family uses?

I said this to my husband and he said ‘I am staying out of this.’

So when my MIL is with my family again and they ask her ‘Hey what name did you land on?’ She’s gonna sit there with a straight face and say she is jacking my grandmother’s name???

The bride’s sister= Cindy

Friend who helped plan these events= May

Today was Bride’s 3rd and final wedding shower, and her sister Cindy wanted to run this one as May has run the others. I felt it was a bit of a dick move since it seemed to me Cindy basically wanted to use all of the decorations and ideas May had painstakingly crafted, but whatever. The event was supposed to start at 2pm. May and I showed up to set up the basics (moving furniture, laying out decorations, etc.) at 11am which was a metric crap load of work. Cindy hadn’t messaged May with any direction of what she wanted, so May and I just started going because we were running out of time to set up. Cindy showed up at 1pm, stayed for 15 min, said nothing, then left. May and I had no idea what to do about decorations or what Cindy wanted, and with guests set to arrive in 30 min, we just started frantically finishing.

Bride showed up around 2:30 and immediately confronted May and I saying Cindy was crying by the cabinets of the bar and was very upset when she arrived and found we were “taking over” the event. May and I tried to explain the whole problem with Cindy not helping earlier and leaving. Bride insisted we should have shown up the same time as Cindy and let her direct us, and we argued if we had, there was no way the event would have been ready by 2. 

Bride later took me aside and stated she was frustrated with May because Bride hadn’t “asked her to put so much time and energy” into her parties, and May was bulldozing others and not being considerate. I defended May by restating our previous points, and remarking if we had waited for Cindy, the party wouldn’t look as nice because we would have been rushing. I offered to address any miscommunication, but it went over like a fart in church and I gave up. 

Personally, I’m not interested in helping out in any more of Bride’s events, as a part of me wants her to see what happens when her flaky sister takes the wheel of a party and have Bride appreciate May and I’s work.

bvv629	2019-06-02 08:03:13	lazyassweeb	AITA for wanting my flatmates to pay or leave?	"Hi guys! 

I moved in a house with 3 other person. One I didnt know, and two friends of mine (I thought). Things went pretty well, despite the thing that they started to befriend each other, and I felt rather lonely, because I was left out from everything. This changed after a while, still I wasnt part of the big family; I had to work and go to school also, while they only had to do one of this, so had more time to party. 

Eventually problems did pop up, there is no living together without them. First I noticed that noone is cleaning, just me. We talked about it, saying that they are cleaning too, I just never see it, and anyway I make dirt here here and there. I was also been called unclean, for always leaving my coat in a kitchen chair. Thats because I has the smallest room, but they said well thats my own problem, so I took care of it. Okay, I did. 

After a while, it started to bother me that they smoke in the kitchen (i used to too, but I stopped), because I dont smoke at all now (only 420 cigs). But they said there are  more of them so they can. 

All these things (and more) led to a big argument when I was sick (It started with I asked them not to smoke cuz I cant breath) , where I and the couple (my friends), but mostly the guy shouted at each other about the others fails. Like how I leave my hair in the bath after shower, that I stink, that my room stink (why are they went in my room?), that they never clean only me; and its been said again that they clean I just dont see it. 

After a few days we tried to talk it through, but the guy was way too passive agressive about it, and the girl was really manipulate, turning my words against me and stuff. I felt tired and humiliated again. The 3rd flatmate wanted a second chance, so when I asked them to leave the house, she was on their part about not to leave. 

I decided not to clean the house, lets see how they do it. This was 2-3 months ago, and since noone cleaned. Its disgusting, but I dont want to be their maiden anymore. We stopped talking also. 

Another thing I have to mention that is the couple has a temperament, which means when they argue, they shout a lot and broke things. Most of the time the only problem is that I cant sleep from them (which is bad enough), but this time they broke 2 doors while arguing. Not much, but parts broke off, the lock is fucked and one has a big broke line in the center. I has to say that these are big ass wood doors so they really put some effort in it.

I asked them to fix it, but I only got some laughing reactions. I havent been home since then; I feel anxious there. 

So I decided to write to the owner about it, but couldnt send the message because I felt awful, like some snitch. 

So AITA if Id actually send the mail and see what happens? Im pretty much afraid of the consequences. 

Tldr: I have problems with my flatmates, but has moral problems about giving them out and what they did to the owner,because I wasnt a Saint either."	Not the A-hole	0	0

The host family friends have kids, one of whom is a twelve year old girl. She was incredibly annoying the whole time. Now, seeing as she was the host's daughter, I tried to let it slide and whatever.

Then, we were playing Heads-up and the word was ""George Bush"" and someone else playing was like ""OP really hates this president!"" And the person guessing said ""Donald Trump?"" I joked ""don't get me started on that guy"" and the lil shithead started asking me ""Why do you hate the president of the United States? He's a great president."" (Verbatim)

My friends at the table also tried to turn the convo away, knowing I get pretty heated about politics in general (PoliSci major lol). I told her nicely that I'd rather not discuss unpleasant topics at a celebration and she kept getting up in my face, like actually leaning into my face, demanding answers as to why I don't like Trump. I finally had enough and told her to back off and ""Shut up, you're like twelve."" She didn't. 

For the rest of the party, she continued to harass me and insert herself into conversations I was having with friends. I proceeded to ignore her, at some points even talking over her or ignoring her even if she was directly calling my name.

My friends are split on whether I was an asshole or not. Some of them say I should've just tolerated the kid but others thought I was right. 

Tl;Dr really annoying kid at my friend's party. She tried to rile me up by talking about Trump. I told her to STFU and ignored her for the rest of the party.

I've said I'd pay for them to go airsofting and get drinks (I despise being selfish), but every day the event gets closer the less likely it seems that's possible.

I would have to sell some things to get some more money to pay for everyone. 

So would I be an asshole if I asked people to pay for themselves, or at least chip in as much as they could?

I'm sorry if this sounds childish or anything of the sort. Figured this would be the place to ask since. Thanks kindly.

Update (since some people wanted it): 

I got a second job quickly after posting this and got a decent amount if pocket change, enough to handle payment so there was no problems to begin with. 


However, airsofting place we went to overbooked and thusly kicked us all out once we arrived. They're website doesnt put restrictions on how many participants can apply for a single day. I ended up getting everything moved to next week at no cost, which gave me some breathing room in terms of money to give to my friends. 

Furthermore I offered to fix their website for them. If all goes well, and it ends up preventing people from booking for a day once the maximum number of participants has been reached, everyone going to my event will be paid for by the company, as well as a permanent discount for being a ""friend if the company"". 

Thanks to all who commented. Though it seems minor, I hate being a dick, and knowing that I would have been the asshole in the situation has helped build my character slightly more."	Asshole	0	0

📷

This is a long one. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

For background information:

I'm a girl, 15, from the U.S. My mom's from the Phillippines, so there's a cultural difference.I also know that a lot of her behaviors come from her mother, who was very demanding and abusive (I've heard stories of matches being held to her lips for talking back). Her father was also an alcoholic, and she was a witness to a lot of abuse. So overall, she grew up poor, in a developing country, with her only parental figures being abusive, to get you into her mindset. So onto the situation:

My mother and I have had relationship problems for a long time, starting when I was around 8-9 years old. We've just constantly argued and been at odds with each for as long as I can remember. I know she loves me, but from an early age she's expected too much from me: I constantly had to do chores that my little brother never had to do. I had to sweep, wipe tables and counters, do dishes, clean the stove, fold laundry, etc. etc. etc., all the while watching my brother play the X-box. This was the main root of a lot of our arguments, but as I got older, it branched off into a lot of different things. 

&#x200B;

So, in eighth grade, I started going with my dad to our family's counselor, in hopes of improving my mom and I's relationship. This wasn't easy; this counselor was across town, an hour drive from our house. This meant that every Saturday, I gave up 3-4 hours of my time  inhopes of a good relationship with my mom. I missed out on a lot of plans with my friends because it took up so much time, but I thought it would be worth it. But my mom refused to come with me. 

&#x200B;

So I begged. I begged her to try. It meant so much to me, but she dismissed all of my attempts with, ""If only you just listened to me, we wouldn't have any problems. I'm done with \*insert counselor here\*."" 

&#x200B;

Cut to present day. I've recently found out that my parents are divorcing, and in light of this, my mom's suddenly putting in all this effort to be close to me.I feel like a jerk, but I've just been really cold towards her during this. It's just that whenever she pulls this crap where she's suddenly the best mother ever, all I can remember is 13 year old me crying in her room, begging her to just please come and try to talk with me about things.  I've gotten comments from friends who say, Wow, you literally hate your mom. But I'm just so tired of trying so hard and getting nowhere. 

&#x200B;

AITA?

I traded an ounce of this syrup for a quarter of tree. I told her I prefer sativa and never smoke Indica. She comes home and gives me the quarter. The amount of syrup I would give her is worth more in value ($75) than the tree she got ($65). I ended smoking the Sativa Hybrid and selling the Indica for $40. She texts me today mad (I'd be more than happy to post a screenshot of text if I'm allowed to and if someone shows me how) about how she didn't like me selling it and how it was for me to smoke. I reminded her that I don't like Indica strains. 
Anyways I'm wondering if she has the right to be mad and she's demanding a refund even though I smoked the weed and don't even have the cash to her the amount back.

We were REALLY drunk. We were returing home after a party. At the distance we saw a couple. A man and a woman walking towards us. We literaly were minding our own buissnes, talking about food, when ,out of nowhere this random guy hits my friend in the face. 


I personaly didnt see it because i was looking at a burger king that was on our right. But my friend did and he shouted ""He punched Ed (my other friend). So i started running the guy, who obviously knew he f*cked up. So we chase him for 3 blocks, and my friend (the one who got hit) grabbed him and throw him to the ground and hit him. (We were really drunk so we didnt aimed). So then 1 seconed later after that punch i arrived. (Yes i am slow running, i arrived second. My other friend was still runing towards us). 


So i arrived, and hit the guy in the face when he was about to stand up. He fell again, and me and my friend started punching and kickin him. After aprox. 5 punches and 4 kicks, my other friend arrives and kicks him. 3 vs 1. It wasnt really a fight, it was more of a vengance. After 10 seconds of hiting him and shouting at him the police arrived. After that we went home.

So, AITA for joining in that ""fight""? My family told me that i didnt have to join and hit the guy.

Just to clarify: Me and my friend are all 20 yo. I was really drunk so i didnt think about the situation. Yes, now i realise that we could have killed him. But it was a reaction. All i wanted was to revenge my friend. I dont know if to call it a fight,"		1	0

hopefully that made sense.

Every single damn time, it's just about her, and every single time I have to offer sympathy, because what else do I do? I've told her that I'm no therapist because of the amount of times she's leaned on me to say something, and really, I don't know what the fuck to say. The times I've said something, she gets deeper and deeper into her problems. I really am glad that somebody feels like they can talk to me about their really serious problems, but it's problems that I can't step in and do for themselves. They can not go a few minutes without turning it into a session where I stay quiet and they start ranting. I've politely told her to get professional help, but she wont budge. I have my own mental issues and an important year of education for me to worry about. I'm starting music school real soon and I can't set much time to really just sit around and listen to peoples problems every single day, so I've been not talking to her because of her ranting. I sympathise for her mental problems, but she hasn't tried to do anything to fix it.

bvuy79	2019-06-02 07:26:21	skihale	AITA to cut off my mother for blowing 40k of money that wasn't hers?	"Sorry for how long this is, I'm just really conflicted and am having a hard time.

tldr; my mother thinks I am the biggest AH in the world because I cut her off for her behavior towards myself, my brother, our father, and her family. She blew $40k of money that wasn’t hers and got onto some really bad habits.

\-

After my brother and I moved out, my mother decided to leave my father for abuse that he did during their marriage of 30 years. She left and moved in with her bf, who she was dating before she left. She then ‘borrowed’ over $25k from my dad over the last year to ‘help get by’.

Context: They are still not divorced. She asked him for money even after she was living with another man.

'Help get by' means money to buy a four-wheeler to go camping with her new boyfriend (something she never wanted to do with us), eating out when she had a phone bill she wasn't paying her rent, and gas for the car to drive around. That’s not including the $15k that she got from my aunt because the rest wasn’t enough.

No one knows where all the money went. All we know is that over $40k is just gone in less than a year. Not to mention the drug habit she picked up from her new bf.

When she visited us a few weeks ago, I reached a breaking point. She showed up high bc she snorted a percocet in the plane bathroom and had alcohol on top of it. She did it knowing that she’d be around my 7 year old cousin who was visiting.

That night when we finally got home, I catch a liquefied pill leak from her nose. She claimed that it was for her back pain. I asked her why she didn’t just take it normally and she couldn’t give me a straight answer. I demanded that she refrain from it while in our house.

After seeing just how sick my mother was getting, I asked everyone to stop giving her money. This cascaded into my mother having a complete meltdown. She has to feel rock bottom otherwise nothing’s gonna change. We're forcing her to sink or swim.

Then my brother called me and told me that she had asked his fiance’ and her parents for money. That was it. I paid out of my own pocket to get her on an earlier flight and sent her back home early. I kicked her out of our house.

Then I got a call from a long time friend a couple days ago. Mom had gone on FB asking everyone she knew for money. Including my friend and her mom. I called my mom and ranted about how embarrassed and ashamed I was. She called my friend a coward for contacting me instead of her to get the ‘real story’.

It was my breaking point. I just said, ""The person you are now isn't my mother. When you figure out how to be her again, let me know. I love you. Bye."" She hasn't tried to contact me since, but she’s been telling people how mean I am.

It's been heartbreaking to hear all these things she’s said. I just don't know what to do.

bvuxcg	2019-06-02 07:22:07	feelsultrableachman	AITA for ditching my friend?	"So for context, me and this friend, we'll call them V attend the same church and school. From this church, we have two senior friends graduating high school this year (X and S). V is best friends with X and I am best friends with S. The graduation ceremony is hosted on our football field and our school decides to do our grad ceremony quite differently. So on the North side of the field, students with last names A-L will graduate there. On the South side, students with last names starting with M-Z will graduate. On each side, there are separate speakers with counselors calling out names. Basically, people sitting in the South side will not be able to see or hear students graduating from the North side.

&#x200B;

This info about graduation was not given to me until the day of the actual ceremony. Well before the event, V and I planned to sit together during the ceremony to watch our friends graduate. Another friend A, who was there for his girlfriend, would also be joining us. X's last name lands her in the North side while S's last name lands in the South side. A's girlfriend would also be on the South side. The tickets given to us by our friends correspond with their section so therefore, we would be separated. A tells me that the speakers are separated so at this point I'm conflicted. 

&#x200B;

I told V that I would probably be sitting on the South side now since that was the only ticket I had and was the only area where I would be able to see S graduate.  A also did the same since he was going for his girlfriend. V tells me that X has an extra ticket for the North side but I refuse it because I really just want to sit in the South and watch S. V states that she will be sitting all alone. At this point, I felt bad for leaving V alone but the whole reason I came to graduation was to see S graduate and by sitting with V, I couldn't. 

&#x200B;

For about a week now, V has been ignoring both A and me. I still feel like utter trash for ditching her in the North side but I feel like i'm also justified. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

A good friend of mine is staying in the city I live in for awhile.  We have been friends with benefits in the past.  I've known this friend to be a bit of a wanderer and non committal.  However, he has a girlfriend now and he seems to be invested.  Before coming to the city the GF proposed they have an open relationship because he has needs.  This friend landed in the city and asked to hang out almost immediately.  I knew at this point he had a girlfriend and went in with the idea that I wasnt going to mess with that, temporary open relationship or not. However, we had such a good time at dinner it felt like a date and soon he was back at my place.  I was nervous and he could tell but he was gentle and one thing lead to another and we didn't have sex but we basically did everything else.  I felt guilty almost as soon as we were done.  He left quickly and stated they had rules about not staying the night. I found out other rules like that his GF needs to know the name and what they look like.  A week or so has passed and I still feel kind of bad.  I feel like it sounds like the GF is not entirely comfortable with this because of the rules that are in place.  Personally what does it matter what I look like? Also I feel guilty because he landed in the city and he came directly to me.  Someone who he has history with.  I'm not a random from a dating app. I feel a little bit like a substitute and he hasn't really spoken to me since. So am I the asshole for doing this knowing full well it probably wasn't a good idea to begin with, I feel like I helped him emotionally and physically cheat and I should have kept it in my pants.

bvuwdy	2019-06-02 07:17:27	Oscur925	AITA for calling the cops on my GF?	"Background info: We’ve been living together for 5 years and recently had a baby, he’s 4 months old. 

A few weeks ago we were at a family gathering on a Sunday night and out of no where she got blacked out drunk. At the time she was staying home with the baby while I worked 5 days a week from 8-6. She would get up during the night to soothe the baby when he woke up crying or needed to be breastfed. She obviously couldn’t do that this night so I was pissed that she didn’t talk to me before to set up a plan for care and that I had to stay up with the baby on a Sunday night with work the next day (and other reasons, see edit 2). I asked if we could leave the baby with my parents and pick him up the next day so I could get sleep and function at work but she refused since we had not done any overnights with our baby yet (wouldn’t have be a viable solution anyway, see edit 2). I got really pissed off at the whole situation and called her an irresponsible bitch (yes I know IATA for not keeping my cool and lashing out like this). I drove home and we didn’t say a word to each other. 

When we got home she almost fell walking up the stairs. Then she took the baby, and **I urged her to let me take care of the baby that night** and told her to sleep it off on the couch. Since she was pissed from what I said earlier, she refused. At this point I was worried about the baby’s safety as she could hardly stand on her own but she refused to give me the baby saying “he’s my kid”. This triggered me and I told her that I was going to call the cops if she didn’t give me the baby, at which point she said “go ahead they always side with the mom”, so I did. The cops did not side with her, told her to sleep it off while I rocked the baby to sleep in another room. I felt like shit calling the cops on her, and we’ve never had a fight like this but as a new parent this was the only thing I could think of to get our baby out of her hands and into mine as she was doing this out of spite because of what I said to her in the car. AITA?

**Edit:** I want to say that when the cops arrived, I stressed that I only wanted to care for the baby and for her to sleep it out. In no way did I want them to take any action against her. We also live about an hour and a half from the nearest relative.

And as a new parent, I felt for the first time ever what it feels like to fear for your child’s safety which is why I think I took it to that extreme, even though I regret doing it now.

**Edit 2:** I guess it’s too late for this now, but there’s a reason why I was upset about having to take over for the night aside from having to work the next day. I already know IATA for cursing at her. The reason for the post was for calling the cops, but everyone is judging on what I said or assuming that I didn’t want to take care of my kid for the night.

That Friday I tried watching the baby alone while she had a girls night out. Turns out that when a baby is that young and spends 24/7 with their mom, they become attached and reliant on them for comfort **(I was either at work or commuting 90% of the day, obviously I couldn’t spend that much time with my child, but I seem to be getting crucified for this).** About an hour in when it got close to his bedtime, he started having a meltdown. For an hour straight, I tried everything in the book to soothe him but nothing worked. I had never heard him cry like that before, I was freaking out. My cousin, who also has a newborn and a couple of older kids was with me at the time and he even said it was time to call mom, as we started to worry about the distress the baby was in. As soon as she got back and held him, he instantly stopped crying. We were amazed but realized that we definitely had to work on him getting more comfortable with me. Needless to say I was kind of traumatized with the experience - I don’t do well when my baby cries like that (severe distressed crying), I literally start crying as well (I’ve gotten better with that since then). Then two days later, this happened. So yeah, it’s not that I didn’t want to “watch my baby for one night”, it was me literally reliving that Friday and pissed that she got drunk knowing that the baby nor I were not ready for a night without her yet. Regardless, **I urged her to let me watch the baby that night.**

**info:** Since apparently “I’m a terrible dad that should have the baby taken away from me”, we talked about it the next day and realized we both fucked up. We both acted irrationally but we’ve been going through a whirlwind of emotions as first time parents. I’ve just never stopped feeling guilty about calling the cops. She’s now back to work and I’m staying home with the baby for a month and a half and I’m glad to say he has bonded to me on a level similar to his mom."	Asshole	0	0

He is now on a roadtrip and asked me earlier today if he cook stay with me for the weekend in my city, as it's closer to his destination and will save him an extra three hours of driving. It was short notice but I hesitantly agreed. We though it would be fun to drink together, so I went out and purchased some beer for the two of us. After around 4 or 5 I was feeling great, but he clearly could not hold his drinks. Fast forward to now and he is completely, belligerently drunk, knocking things over. When I asked if he needed to throw up, he didn't make it to the bathroom and threw up all over my carpet. Now it's just past 3 am, I'm desperately trying to make sure my carpet doesn't stain, and he keeps badgering me to go retrieve his clothes for tomorrow from his car while half passed out on my couch.

bvuv20	2019-06-02 07:11:23	PixiiStick	WIBTA for asking my friends to pay for their tickets?	"So tomorrow (June 2nd) I was supposed to be traveling up to Seattle, WA from Portland, OR with two friends. We were planning to see a well known duo who do comedy and video game commentary in an interactive show. This is their last show of this kind, ever. As a group we decided to take the whole day and have fun since we hadn't hung out or done anything together in nearly a year.

Since my friends were dealing with their senior years of high school, I offered to put together a plan, budget, and front the bill for the tickets. (More on that later). So I put together a plan that covered transportation (provided by me), food, and entertainment until the show in the evening which they agreed to.

I agreed to foot the $230 bill for the tickets on the condition that I would be paid back the week of the event (this last week) their portions of the tickets including fees - some $70 odd dollars a piece. The three of us agreed to the terms and went about our lives.

Fast forward to the beginning of this week when my friends text me in the group chat saying they might not be able to make it for various reasons.

Okay, why not tell me this a week or two ago? Regardless I ask for a solid answer as soon as they can get it to me, preferably the next day or two so I can find someone else to go with me or get a refund on the tickets. I also offer to help them study if that will help them.

After not hearing anything, I text them again on Friday and ask for a solid answer this time. I get one saying that he wants to stay home and study instead. The other says that she is going to use the day to catch up on her late work she has been hoarding since back in March which is all due this Monday. Without anybody going with me, I can't go either.

At this point I have tried to find others to go with, get a refund, and sell my tickets. All of my other friends I asked would have loved to go but are busy that day. Ticketmaster had a refund window of 72 freaking hours after purchase for these tickets which I was not made aware of when purchasing (yes I understand that is bad on my part, I won't argue it). And on top of that on the official pages for this show there have been a number of fraud tickets being sold which has detured people from buying and gotten me no hits at all.

I am honestly so frustrated and feel taken advantage of in this situation. I can't just take this kind of a financial hit right now. I spent a whole month's paycheck on these tickets and made my friends well aware that I could not just swallow it if they decided not to go. At this point I have considered asking if they will pay for their shares of the tickets since they left me to fend for myself with such a big bill.

Would I be the asshole for asking them to pay their share of the ticket cost even though none of us are going to the event?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I live in an old house that has been converted into three apartments. In addition to me, a single dude and a family of three make up the other two tenants. Recently, the family of three got fleas in their apartment. Property management is less than satisfactory and the flea treatment they say they performed wasn't cutting it for the family. They decided they wanted to hire a pest control specialist to fog all three apartments, with each of us chipping in for the cost. 

For context, I was diagnosed and treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma six years ago, and since then, I have made a point to avoid any unnecessary contact with potentially harmful chemicals, such as those in household pesticides. I am very apprehensive about treating my apartment with the fogger, as I have heard they do little to combat the fleas while coating all of your belongings in insecticide. I would like to fog only as a last resort. 

Additionally, I have set up flea traps only to find no fleas in my apartment, which is on the first floor, while the family is on the second floor. I told the family I would set up the traps just to see if it would even be worth fogging my place and now, despite the traps turning up empty, they are still urging me to have my place fogged.

"Alright so me and someone had been traveling all day doing a day trip several hours away and ended up stopping at a restaurant before the drive home. I ordered a burger and asked not have their “special sauce” on it because I knows it’s just a bunch of stuff mixed up that I won’t want. I remember the waiter making s comment about it so I know he heard me and I saw him write it down. Waited 20 minutes for food and my burger comes with the sauce all over the bottom of the burger. I ask to get a new one since I really don’t want that sauce. He came back just a few minutes later and told me “sorry we grabbed the wrong burger.” So I started eating since everyone else was and we had a long drive ahead. I noticed about half way through my burger that I got a slight hint of something that tasted weird. I glanced and noticed that I could see where they had just scraped off the sauce and gave me the burger back, apparently not even replacing the bottom bun. I was pissed. Granted I hadn’t even noticed that they did that but I just thought that was really shitty of them to do. I was already full and really tired after the trip and was about to start driving for another 4 hours so I really just wasn’t in the mood or had the energy to fight with the staff or manager so I just left without tipping. I am someone who knows where to put blame, and I can probably guarantee that the waiter could clearly see that he didn’t just grab the wrong burger and the cook probably said “here wait, alright here just give it back to him.” So that’s why I didn’t feel like he deserved a tip after doing something like that. Am I the asshole?

Edit: one detail I forgot to mention that makes me believe the waiter knew what happend: after we all had finished he asked us “did everything taste alright?” While kinda checking at me more at what I would say.

Edit: ok I guess I’m the asshole for skimping a guy out of $7 after him and the restaurant tricked me and serving me the wrong food after already trying to get the situation resolved.

Edit: for those asking why I didn’t double check the second burger was because the first one had the sauce pouring out of the sides of under the burger. The second one came back and it didn’t have any visible sauce ( from the outside) so I just figured it was good since it went from pouring all over to none visible."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I feel like the backstory to our friendship is important. when we became friends, a lot of our other friends turned on us and talked badly about us (high school stuff) and she was there for me, as I was for her. we were best friends. she drifted from me slightly and found a new best friend, but we were still very close.

last year she got into a relationship with one of our mutual friends who she was closer to. at this point she knew that she was bi (altho i’ve always suspected that she is gay). this girl has a history of cheating. she had led on & emotionally manipulated 2 people before this and had cheated on her ex girlfriend (with 1 of the ppl she led on). i found it weird that she got in a new relationship but didn’t question it.

a couple of months later she cheated on him with a girl who turned out to be 15 (she is 18). she thought the girl was 16, but continued hooking up with her even after she found out she lied about her age. this really bothered me and made me feel rlly conflicted because i felt bad for her bf. she also admitted to me multiple times that she was lesbian and had told her bf that he didn’t satisfy her sexually. i let this all go bc at this point i had moved away for college and was barely seeing them/talking to them anyways. she stopped cheating on him (as far as i know)

i’m back home for summer and we’ve been catching up. she told me an older married guy at her job has been trying to get with her. i thought she was exaggerating until she read the messages he sent saying creepy stuff about her body, how he wanted to do things with her, and how he checks her out at work. i suggested she report him. instead she continues to entertain this creep and told me she was enjoying the attention (i think she’s considering getting with him)

i’m genuinely pissed. she doesn’t even like men, at this point she’s just cheating and hurting peoples feelings just to be selfish and shitty. my boyfriend hates her and wants to tell her bf abt the cheating, but it would be obvious that it was coming from me since i’m one of the only people she’s told. i don’t know what to do. i’ve held on and tried to give her advice for this long bc we got distant anyways and she was there for me during hard times. but i’m feeling like such a villain for being complicit in all of this

i guess what i’m asking is: would i be the asshole for cutting her off and how should i go about it? i don’t want drama but i feel like this kid needs to know what a selfish piece of shit his gf is

should i let my boyfriend tell her man? i feel like that would make me just as shitty as her by violating something she told me w trust"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"A couple days ago, I had a pretty bad argument with my mom and I went to my partner's house to cool off for a few days.

J's girlfriend used to live here; they broke up awhile ago and she moved out, but now they're back together. She doesn't want to move back in.

Z is perfectly fine with me being here. My partner is fine with me being here. J, however, isn't thrilled. He says he wasn't consulted at all about me moving in, that I'm rearranging the entire house, and that he doesn't feel like he's welcome in the living room anymore.

My partner did not tell J that I would be staying here (I did not know about this; he told me everything was fine), however I'm not moving in permanently. This is a temporary stay. I'm not trying to rearrange the house; I cleaned the kitchen and bathroom, offered to build them a TV stand for all their gaming consoles, and offered to reupholster an ottoman and couch they have. I'm not preventing him from using the living room during the day; however, my partner and I sleep in the living room because it's a two bedroom house, and we do ask that he's out by a reasonable hour because my partner works and has school. I'm trying to pull my weight around here so I'm not completely mooching off them. J also has no problem with H staying here most nights, and she doesn't pay rent either.

&#x200B;

One of these friends is allergic to milk, but he's not *horribly* allergic. He can have some things that have a little milk, i.e. dark chocolate, buttered breadsticks, stuff like that. Still, when someone's hosting a party and they order pizza for dinner, he's said a few little things that indicate that he expects them to get a cheeseless pizza for himself. Keep in mind, we do make sure that we serve things he can eat (i.e. aforementioned breadsticks, he can take the cheese off the pizza and eat it that way, chips, other food). Also keep in mind most of us are in college and don't exactly have a lot of money to spend on an extra cheeseless pizza just for him (if I was making a lot more money, I wouldn't put up as much of a fight).

&#x200B;

He's never been particularly rude about it, but the fact that he has indicated to be catered to that degree bugged a few of my friends, who mentioned it to me. A bit later, while he and I were talking one day, I told him about that we shouldn't have to cater to him. He was kinda defensive about it, but neither of us really were jerks about it. We ended in a stalemate, though, with neither of us really yielding.

&#x200B;

This discussion with him happened months ago, and we're still really good friends (it hasn't been brought up since), but I've always wondered about which one of us was in the right. I can understand how having an allergy can be hard, and I feel like it's generally on the host to make sure everybody's accommodated, so I kinda feel bad, but at the same time, this seems a little excessive to me. So, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Let me clarify, he can take the cheese off a normal pizza and eat it that way, and it's essentially the same. It's not like we're denying him the main course. 

We generally get (ready-made) pizza because it's cheap and we're poor. If we could afford to get something more expensive that still accommodates him, we would (or, at least, I would)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

This kid does have some mental problems and very few friends along with being bullied buts a complete ass.  A few things he’s done to me are shoving his face in my birthday cake last year, he unplugs my PlayStation when he comes over (also changed my old main accounts password to random things and then forgot it), and he normally shouts and doesn’t listen.  So I finally lost it on him not too long ago when he came over after being bullied by people at school and losing a friend.  I had bought Chinese for us and told him to not take it to my room upstairs since he’s a messy eater and has stained my carpet before but he decides to bring his food upstairs and spill it everywhere. So I finally lose it on him and just start shouting from all this anger and I feel bad but don’t know if I was in the right for all the shit he does.	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvumt1	2019-06-02 06:33:30	BigFatBurner	WIBTA if I moved out?	"I'm 19 years old and live with my grandmother, father, and brother. It's very stressful living with them because my grandmother often snaps at me for everything. Usually, something bad will happen to her, and then because she's mad, she'll find something to yell at me for. For example, when she found out her basement flooded, she yelled at me for being asleep when she found out. When she accidentally lost control of her bladder, she yelled at me for bringing my video game system into the house. I know my dad's trying to save up money for a new place, but I just can't do this anymore. Especially when I know if I say something to contradict her, my dad will jump in and start getting in my ass as well. I work as a bank teller, so it was easy for me to set up a secret account without telling them so they couldn't have access to my funds. I've been putting a portion of my paychecks into the secret account and all of it's going towards moving.

What's eating me about this is I'm the only one capable of doing chores around the house at any time. Everything that gets done in the house is done by me. My grandmother's in her 70's doesn't have the strength or the energy like she used to. My dad has a bad back, but he's kind of a special case. He's morbidly obese, and his doctors have said that was the root of his back pain. It's easy to say he did it to himself, but I feel like that's just too cold. As for my brother, he's not mentally or physically disabled, but I would say he's... Challenged, for a lack of a better word. My brother *could* do the things I do, but my dad and grandmother feel like it would be easier to just ask me to do it.

I want to get out of this house so much, but I know if I leave I'm putting them in a bad position by leaving them to do things they're not physically or mentally capable of. Would I be selfish if I left?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvumf6	2019-06-02 06:31:48	zenzer42	AITA for yelling at the driver of a stopped car who was on her phone?	"This happened about 20 minutes ago, about 11:00 pm. 

I walking home from a friend's place. As I'm walking towards a crosswalk, there is a lady in her car, right in the middle of the crosswalk. There were no other cars around, as I was walking in a more residential area and it was late. I could see that the driver was on her phone and not paying attention to the road at all, and clueless to the fact that she was in a crosswalk. 

I walk in front of the car, stop briefly in front of the car to see if she would notice me. She did not. I continue across to the other side, and see she has her window slightly open. 

I tell her firmly, ""If you're going to be on your phone, don't be in the crosswalk,"" and continued walking away with my back to her. 

I hear her say, ""Oh, fuck off,"" so I raised my hand to flip her of.

She calls me an asshole so I flipped her off with my other hand.

Apparently she turned down the way I was walking, and called me a jackass, so I gave her the finger one last time.

Now, I feel like I could have just walked in front of her car and not said anything. It wasn't a big inconvenience for me just to take an extra couple of steps around her car, but lately I've been fed up with people taking up the crosswalk like pedestrians don't even exist. I live in a large city where there are always pedestrians, and I feel every driver should keep that in mind. I just don't know if yelling at her was the right way to go about it. I feel like I just interjected a bunch of negativity that wouldn't change her behavior at all, just make her mad.

bvum1l	2019-06-02 06:30:09	throawah918273645	WIBTA if I didn’t give my cousin’s son my PS4?	"I bought a PS4 slim about a year ago and I’ve turned it on once. It just sits unused on my TV stand. So I thought it might be a nice gesture to give it to my cousin’s son who might actually use it. Last thanksgiving we talked a lot about how much he is playing video games, particularly Rainbow Six Siege. He mentioned he’d like to play some PS4 exclusives but he only has an XBOX One.

So this evening I send him a text saying hi, happy summer vacation, how are things going, are you going to do anything this summer? Then I also ask him if he’d be interested in having my PS4. He responds to my greeting with “Hi. Good. Nothing much. Yes. I would want it.”

Now, I wasn’t expecting and didn’t need an overwhelming amount of gratitude after I offered him a free PS4. I was, though, hoping for more than one word answers to my greeting and a thank you from him for  giving him a free PS4. This left me feeling a little unappreciated.

Now, I’m also taking into consideration that he lives somewhere that would be a two hour drive round trip. It’s something that I don’t particularly want to do on my weekend if this gesture isn’t being appreciated. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I came up with an excuse saying I wasn’t able to drop it off this week in hopes he forgets about the offer and instead I just sell it at GameStop since he doesn’t seem to appreciate what I was offering?

—————————————————

UPDATE
I sent him the PS4 instead of driving the two hours to deliver it. Personally, I think this is an ESH because yes, I understand it would have been made me an asshole to offer it and then decided not to. On the other hands, manners cost nothing and a simple thank you would have been polite, especially since he gets a free current gen console. Either way, it’s been resolved."	No A-holes here	0	0
bvuiv9	2019-06-02 06:15:53	candyandsugar1993	WIBTA for getting a door dash driver in trouble?	I need honest advice and I’m fully willing to accept my judgement if it would make me an asshole. My boyfriend ordered food for us on door dash tonight. When the guy came, he was in a bad mood, and said “I sat outside the gate for THREE MINUTES.” (he wasn’t yelling, but was upset, and put a lot of emphasis on “three minutes”). I said, “Im so sorry I had no idea, my boyfriend was the one that ordered the food-“ (he interrupted me and started to talk down to me and he said) “I had to wait for *three minutes!*”I told him the truth and said, “We don’t have a code to the gate either way, the one the landlord gave us doesn’t work, everyone in these apartments lately has been trouble with the gate code”, he ignored what I said and he responded “let me get the food.” He got out, went to the trunk, handed me the food. I apologized again and told him how sorry I was and how the landlords need to fix the gate, and he said, “Yes contact it because they need to give you that code”. I explained why the code wasn’t working (someone ran into the code box and it’s not fully fixed yet) but he really didn’t want to hear it and walked back to his car. I said “I’m so sorry again, have a good night,” and I can’t remember if he responded or not. I don’t think door dash allows you to rate the drivers, and I don’t want to get him in trouble, but he really hurt my feelings. I tried to do everything the right way. WIBTA if I found a way to give him a low rating or contact door dash to let them know he was upset with me? He was really angry and I’m just really hurt and don’t know what’s appropriate or what isn’t, and what would make me an asshole or not	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvuiee	2019-06-02 06:14:02	hipstagramz	WIBTA for dating someone who I'm not in love with?	"I recently had a friend confess feelings for me but I dont reciprocate the same feelings.

All these requirements can be met by a good friend but if they have feelings for me, would I be wrong to play along? They get what they want and i get what i want. I wouldnt cheat on them and would be as nice as a boyfriend would just because that's how i act by nature but the fact it feels like I'm playing with their emotions is where I'm iffy.

bvuhjh	2019-06-02 06:10:30	noodleslikesrice	AITA for considering not inviting my dad to my wedding the future	"For reference, I’m 16 and this coming up school year I’ll be a senior and after will be out of the house in college. 

My dad and I have an amazing relationship that I do cherish, the only problem is my step mom. They have been together since I was 9, married for about 2 years, and living together for 2 years. I have lived with my dad since my freshman year. 

At first she was very nice towards me and showed no dislike for me. After I turned 11 she became very rude. However, in her defense I’m sure I had been mean in a way that at the time I didn’t understand was mean. She began making very rude and passive aggressive comments towards me, especially after we moved in with her. 

A comment that still sticks with me is one that she made while my dad and I lived alone. While I was in my room she had yelled loud enough so I could hear, “What? You want me to be quiet so the hood rat can sleep?” When I lived with my mom I didn’t live in a very good neighborhood but good enough to where I didn’t always have to worry about being in danger. 

For my dads birthday she had had gotten him a cake and a present the day before. When we got home I asked my dad if I could put on the candles and he said yes. I do understand that I shouldn’t have done that considering she is the one who bought the cake, but her actions after are what really upset me. She immediately got angry and threw both the cake and present into the big garbage bin. Following that, after the argument she took both out the trash and expected us to still eat the cake and my dad to open the present...the present remains unopened but the cake was ate. 

I know I’m young and marriage is far in my future but like most teenagers I like to think about big future events. As much as I love my dad and want him at my wedding I can’t stand the idea of my stepmom being there. I know the simple solution to that would be just to invite him and tell him I wouldn’t want my stepmom there but I know it would cause a lot of issues between them. My dad is happy with her and I don’t want to do something that will cause their relationship any troubles. I understand it sounds very hypocritical to say I want my dad happy but knowing if I don’t invite him will make him unhappy but I just can’t find a solution that will keep everyone happy. 

A lot of people are gonna say that my stepmom and I might start to get along once I’m out of the house but I can guarantee that won’t happen. I have tried to grow a bond with her but it always seems to backfire. 

I have a feeling most people are going to think I’m the TA and I understand. I’m hoping this is just a teenage mentality thing and I’ll grow and mature out of it but I still want others opinions. If you have any questions please asks and I’ll try to answer to the best clarity.

bvuhgj	2019-06-02 06:10:07	k80_w	AITA regarding food?	"My bf and I have been together for over four years, though we split for a while (differing opinions of having children). Things have been good lately.

I often bring him home little pseudo-gifts; small stuff, like shampoo or coffee, cheapy headphones, etc. He often replies without much emotion and tells me I should save my money. Often no thank you uttered. Our finances are totally separate, aside from our phone bill because multiple lines were a better deal, and I never ask him for money. I’m getting along just fine.

Sometimes, I stay at his house for a few days straight. I’m a vegetarian and he isn’t, so sometimes I’ll make a grilled cheese or whatever (he doesn’t have tons of vegetarian choices). Last week, I took him camping and paid for all of it, food, site, etc. I even bought meat products for him so he’d eat well too.

Today, I went to his fridge and grabbed one of those mini frozen cheese pizzas. He said “SURE, You can have that!”

His tone was a bit scoldy, so I asked him to clarify. He replied that I never ask to eat his food at his house.

On paper, that sounds like the nice thing to do, but we’ve been together over FOUR years. Like, I wouldn’t think twice about sharing my food with him. I feel like it would be dumb for him to even ask. I often bring my own food over anyway since he hasn’t got lots of vegetarian options as is. I buy and cook shakshuka for us regularly. I offer to pick him up stuff from the store every time I go. To me, food isn’t a question? 

But I guess it is for him. He wants me to ask before I eat at his place and say thank you each time. Maybe I’m the asshole, but I’m a bit offended by that. He said he wouldn’t deny me food, but wants me to say thank you. As someone who often does thank him, buys groceries for him on occasion, and constantly offers to pick up things for him, I feel like I demonstrate my appreciation. Besides, it’s not like he ever cooks for me- I’d always thank a cook. But thank him for a $1 frozen pizza? After four years? Is that not excessive?

I’d say I eat at his place maybe 2x a week. I’d say 4 out of 8 meals a month eaten at his place are cooked using ingredients I bought.  When I do eat his food, its usually just 2 pieces of toast in the morning and *maybe* an egg if I’m really hungry. REGARDLESS, this score keeping is stupid as hell. WE’VE BEEN TOGETHER FOUR YEARS.

Am I the asshole here? Maybe I am? Is this not excessive, though? I didn’t cook the frozen mini pizza and put $30 on his coffee table. He says he doesn’t care if I eat his food, but clearly that’s bullshit.  I truly don’t want to be the asshole so if I am, please let me know.

Thoughts are very appreciated. Thank you."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvugj6	2019-06-02 06:06:14	MiloTheViewer	AITA for cutting ties with my best friend	"This happened a couple of years ago, and I've been thinking about it lately.

It all started in 7th grade, when this kid, let's call him Aaron, moved into the district. That summer I met him through a mutual friend and the three of us got along great. Aaron was a little odd, but it was nice to have a close group of friends after my last clique broke up.

Eventually, our mutual friend stopped talking to us and we were hanging out just the two of us. He was fun and amusing. However, things started to change. We'd do the same things over and over, I'd hear the same jokes. Like I mentioned, he was an odd kid, so it was hard to integrate him with other friends. One time we were with a group of neighborhood kids exploring an abandoned house when he picked up a broken bottle and smashed it on the ground for no reason, one piece of stray glass got lodged in my chest, another hit just above a girl's eye. Things kept getting worse and worse. Aaron slept over a lot, and would use my things without asking, and he creeped out a lot of my cousins and other family members (except for
my mom, who loved him).

At this point I'm done dealing with him. I'm tired of hanging out with him. I start slowly, acting uninterested when he calls, leaving him on read, etc. when he didn't get the hint, I blocked him entirely. Shortly after, he and his mom moved into their new house in a different town and I stopped seeing him.

I can't help but feel guilty for my actions. He was a sweet guy and I probably could've handled things better....so AITA for leaving my former friend in the dark?"	Asshole	0	0

Back in college I had this close friend who bordered on being my girlfriend. Hard to explain... we were exclusive, cared very very much about one another, but we didn’t label it. More like a mutual understanding. For sure we loved each other but I knew deep down it was going to end so I told her that. 

I told her I wanted to end things, and it was rough. Just a sad thing to tell someone you care about. She was not happy about it and felt blindsided. That night we slept in the same bed because she was visiting from out of town and it made sense situationally... or so it seemed. 

Here is the part where I feel like an asshole. For some time she was ready to have sex with me but I always told her that I wasn’t ready. Well... all the sudden on the night I broke up with her I felt ready. She had been waiting for my move for weeks so I asked her and we were both excited to get to work. 

The first and last time we had sex was about two hours after I broke up with her. I feel like a total asshole. Break up with someone and then get in bed with them right after? Seems like a fucked up mind game and I don’t like myself for doing that. The next morning I had to re-explain that I still wanted to separate. She thought my offer to have sex was evidence of me changing my mind about the breakup... and I understand that. 

There is no way she is the asshole. She just walked away hurt. Am I an asshole or did I just make a mistake?"		1	0

(Note: this happened about a month ago.)

&#x200B;

Basically, I mentioned my ex and how she manipulated me emotionally, sent unsolicited nude pictures to 5+ people, threatened to get my now current girlfriend's IP and selling it, etc. One person comes up with the bright idea of inviting her into a Discord group. I oblige by inviting her into the group. While said friends were scolding her she mentions about how she sent Zillow links of her supposed address. I said something to the effect of ""Oh I forgot about that"" and I posted the screenshot. She goes all defensive and claims she was going to get my account banned for doxxing. 

&#x200B;

Somehow with one singular report she actually managed to get my account banned. After 3 stressful days of going back and forth with the Discord Trust and Safety Team, they weren't going to reinstate my account. One of the moderators/admins personally said to me that an gallery of screenshots I took and put in an imgur file wasn't enough and that I needed to get the link of the messages so they could investigate it. I told them that it wasn't possible for me to get the link to the messages because my account was still banned. They still wouldn't reinstate my account. With all the evidence I had against her, it meant nothing and me posting one screenshot in a group chat is all it took to get banned.

"I live in a major city, and a few weeks ago I was crossing the road to reach my local tram stop while not really paying attention to my surroundings. Suddenly, an empty fried chicken box landed at my feet, giving me a small shock. I instinctively picked it up and got angry that someone had littered when I know there are bins on the tram platform. 

I looked up and saw a man with a large beard looking over the railing at me, holding a piece of chicken. I shouted ""hey, is this yours?"" while holding the box, and he turned around to ignore me. I stormed up to the platform and confronted him and said something like ""why the hell would you just throw a box this size into the middle of the road when there are bins right up here?!"" and tried to get him to take the box. He kept ignoring me, and after a few awkward seconds I said ""that's disgusting"" and walked off to put the box in the bin. 

As I was walking, almost everyone on the platform gave me dirty looks, and one woman even moved away from me when I stood next to her, shaking her head as she did she. Confused, I looked back at the man I had told off and realised he was very clearly homeless, but I had not noticed because when I first saw him he was elevated behind a barrier. 

Everyone seemed to think I was an asshole for shouting at a homeless person, but I am not sure if I was justified or not. If a non homeless person had thrown an almost shoebox sized box of chicken bones onto the street and almost hit someone, I feel I would have been supported for telling him off. I probably wouldn't have done it if I knew he was homeless, but I still think people should be called out for littering."	Not the A-hole	0	0

He would constantly text me and try to get together and i admit i relented and did hang out with him a few times this year because i kept on trying to give myself a chance to like him again or something, but mostly because i did not have the energy to keep blowing him off. and he did NOT get a hint.

we had this big senior night where we were all stuck with the whole grade from 10pm to 7am. we went to this big arcade for like 4 hours and he literally followed me and my friends EVERYWHERE. it was legitimately to the point where we were weaving around trying to physically lose him somewhere. we booked this VR experience for 4 people after we finally lost him but when we arrived at the scheduled time he somehow found us and we had to awkwardly tell him we already got tickets. 

i feel so bad because he doesn’t really have any friends but i really do not like him, and every single one of my other friends hate him. when it’s just me and him alone i’ll speak cordially to him, but i think that gives him the idea that i want to be friends when i’m just trying to be acquaintances with him.

I owned a car in one country and then moved to another, the plan was for my Mum to help me sell that one and use the money to buy another in the new country. 

My Mum made me give it to my brother (22) to use as he was still working on his ‘project car’ which hadn’t been running in about a year. 

I looked up it’s worth when it was the original plan, $3000 give or take. 

I bought my car ($4000) with the inheritance my late father gave for a house deposit as I wouldn’t be getting the $3000 any time soon, as the brother was using it still 

8ish months later, it still hasn’t been sold and I go home for a visit — it’s a wreck. He hasn’t taken care of it, crashed it, didn’t clean it once and I spit the dummy. I was assured I’d still get a decent amount for it, the difference in market value coming from my brothers inheritance. 

8 months after that, it’s sold — $1500. I’m told that’s all I’m getting. 

Now, my Mum and brother have refused to tell me how much it’s been sold for until today. And only because my Mum is here visiting and I asked point blank did I get an answer. After telling me I’d only get $1500 I blow up and tell her that they have no respect for me or my property.  


Now my boyfriend, Mum and Grandma are all pissed at me because I shouldn’t have said anything as Mum and Gma are leaving tomorrow and I’m ‘ruining’ their trip by not letting it go. I wasn’t argumentative apart from when I was being cut off and not allowed to speak. I tried to handle it maturely. I’m fucking livid.

This has been fine with me up until now as I release I only have $100 in pocket money as he has $450ish. Now I’ve been talking about a new 2 player game coming out end of June and I was asking him if he was down to go halves on it ($50 each for the bundle) and his response to that was that “all people are different.” And called me selfish for not sharing with him.

He honestly smells so bad i find it distracting and can hardly focus on my work. So i told him that. I took him aside after class and told him ""im going to keep it 100 with you, you smell like ass, its honestly distracting how bad you smell, can you please take a shower after gym so i can focus on my work"" (we have gym right before precalc)

He told me i was a dick and said he wished i died, then ran away. Later the teachers found him crying and he told them what i said, but left out what he said. This got me a 3 day ISS for bullying.

Some of my friends, and my girlfriend think i was being an asshole, but the kids who sit by him in other classes texted me telling me i was a legend, and that they agree he should shower, and i shouldnt have gotten in trouble.

bvu9gr	2019-06-02 05:37:11	VeryStickyPastry	WIBTA if I complain about my neighbors’ dogs to the HOA?	"First and foremost, I love dogs. They are my favorite and they are all precious fluffs. 

My neighbors have at least 2 dogs and at least one Great Dane. The Great Dane is tall enough to get head and shoulders over the wall. Any time I am in my yard and the dogs are out, the dog will climb the wall and growl at me. It is taller than I am when on its hind legs, and I am worried he will eventually be able to scale the wall and injure me or my child while we are out. It’s unfair that I have to be worried about a dog protecting its territory in MY yard. I tend to get bit by dogs a lot, no idea why, but it happens more often than I’d like (especially as a dog lover)

And my toddler, being a toddler who has no pets, is too rough with dogs. He’s grabbed a dog by the nostrils once before I could stop him. 

The woman who lives next to me is aware this happens and all she does to stop him is holler at him to get down once or twice (he doesn’t). 

I do not like to even consider this family having to rehome their babies or alter them in some way that is unfair to the dogs, but at the end of the day, I’m not willing to risk my toddler’s safety. 

If I’m the asshole, please give me alternate solutions. I just want to keep my family safe!"	Asshole	0	0

I booked a hotel for myself and a friend for the long weekend a few months ago in preparation as rooms run out very quickly after dates for said event are announced.

Recently a few more friends started talking about the event and seemed very interested, but were not really able to cover the full trip financially  so myself and the guy I am sharing the hotel room with offered this couple to crash in our room for a night to come and hang out with us.

After making it quite clear beforehand and multiple (three times) on the night that they would be expected to pretty much sleep on the floor and not on my bed (as I have the double) they went back a little early and proceeded to get into my double bed anyway.

When I got back to the hotel room a little later and seen them in my bed I was more than a little pissed off and woke them up and told them both to get out and sleep elsewhere in the room. I even planned borrowing sleeping bags for them specifically. They pretty much said no, to which I responded sleep on the floor or leave right now.

After a bit of arguing and me threatening to get the hotel staff to get unwelcome guests out of my room, or sleep on the floor, they both decided to leave, and so did the guy I was originally planning to share the room with as he thought it to be unfair for a couple not to share a double bed. (He did offer me his single bed if I let it slide) they intended on finding somewhere else to stay but after about 15 minutes asked me if they could come back in on my original terms to sleep on the floor.

As they were leaving though, the guy sort of squared up to me and tried to intimidate me and pretty much told me I was being an asshole for making such a big deal about me wanting to sleep in the double bed I payed for.

After this I was feeling very uncomfortable to have either of them stay and pretty much said straight forwardly to sort themselves out wherever they can. The guy I split the room with eventually came back as he payed a share but was quite unhappy with my ""childish behaviour"". Neither of the two guests are from the city and pretty much don't know much of anything about the place but I left them to sort it anyway after all this.

Tl;dr kicked ""mates"" out of the hotel room I payed for after sleeping in the bed that I payed for after I told them multiple times not to, and offered them multiple times to move to the floor as originally planned.

Well since her apartment had it's own room (the whole apartment was shared with 3 others) I started spending a lot more time over there, as a result my belongings piled up there.

Flash forward, we're on Christmas break and she dumps me over the phone, we live 1 state apart but go to college in the same state. I ask if I can get my stuff when we get back from break. She says no and that she'll have her friend deliver it. We get back from break. I wait for a couple weeks before texting her. I ask for my stuff. She doesn't respond. I text her friend. Her friend immediately gets snippy with me about how she doesn't owe me anything. We arrange a date and they return my stuff. 

She only returned a few items, meanwhile roughly $100 is left there. Her friend said that if I contact them again then they will call the cops. So  in order to get the rest of my stuff I go to the cops. I get my stuff back.

Flashforward [edit: 2 months after the incident (yes still dumb, but just providing further details)] and I'm just lonely so I text her ""hey"" next thing I know my dean of students is calling me in about harassment and her campus' police kept my phone ringing and threaten to charge me with harassment.

"So I have a friend who joined the USAF a couple years ago (his dream job) and since then our squad that we played fps games with has kinda stopped playing games together. We still keep in frequent contact through texts.

At his urging I purchased a game called Battlefield V twice against my own better judgement so we could all play together but I sold the game back to Gamestop after a couple weeks where he was unavailable to play. When he was available I purchased it again and then after another couple of weeks where he was unavailable to play I sold it back again.

The pattern here is that he doesn't have a lot of free time to play in between getting engaged to his long term girlfriend and other responsibilities.

Now, half a year later, he is finally available to play with us and has been attempting to peer pressure me into buying BFV again. I refused.

"Me and my friends took an entrance exam for a prestigious school in our country but I was just there because I had nothing better to do. Me and my best friend took the exam in a proctor location because I didn’t feel like spending $100 for a ticket to a school I’m probably not gonna go to anyway but one of my other friends really wanted to get into that school so she took the exam at the actual school. 
A few months later, the results are released. I checked my results and would you look at that, I actually passed. Of course in my ecstasy, I told the news to everyone (I was at my classroom at that time) everyone congratulated me. Next I checked my best friend’s results. Sadly, she didn’t pass but she just brushed it off because she didn’t really mind. We weren’t really that academically inclined so me passing was kinda suprising, especially because we drank the night before and were hungover on the day of the exam. Next, we checked for my other friends’ results. A lot of us were on it because of my initial uproar. Again, sadly, she didn’t pass. It wouldn’t have mattered if only a few people knew it but now, our whole class knows about it and news spreads fast in my school. 
The impact on her was big because her cousin was already studying there and her family is really strict on education, part of it because they were the owners of our school. 
I feel like I’m at fault for drawing the attention to the results, disregarding the possibility that she may not pass and the shame it would bring to her."	No A-holes here	1	0

Me and my sister have never been close. We have a 13 year age gap and her life decision's have never made us close. At Christmas time she gave me one of those candles with jewelry hidden inside. I gave her a bath bomb and some stuff from Lush as well as $100 gift card to her favorite store. She insisted we burn the candle while we were all there so we can see the jewelry that was inside. I am not a fan of jewelry and the ring inside was two sizes smaller than my finger. The ring was damaged when it came out due to her trying to fish it out. Her daughter liked it and it fit her finger instead of mine so I decided to give the ring to her since it wouldn't fit me and it would most likely stay in my drawer of my house since I couldn't wear it. Her daughter told her about the ring as she was excited and my sister lost it on me saying I was ungrateful and she would never buy me a present ever again. Am I the asshole?  She ordered a ring knowing it wasn't my size and she said I should keep it for a sentimental value even though it was cheap garbage.

I will also add that since the ring was damaged I emailed the company asking them to send me a new one so I wasn't just giving the ring away. I was getting another one in the mail soon. She is still pissed at me. She texted me the next day telling me how awful I was and that I offered to take it back and she said no because her daughter will be devastated. I will also add she has no close relationship with her daughter and she only sees her once or twice a year. I cant wear the ring as it's two sizes two small, it was bent so I ordered a new one, gave the bent one to my niece (aka her daughter) AITA? Honestly want an honest opinion since I'm not sure.

bvu311	2019-06-02 05:12:04		AITA for making my sister remove her makeup from my room	"(sorry for format on mobile) 

So I've spend about $500+ on my makeup, my sister keeps her makeup with mine so she can use mine and not feel guilty. 
I didn't really care at the beginning because it was usually kept tidy and clean. 
In the last couple weeks I've had to repeatedly ask her to remember to close certain items that can dry out, when they dry out heaps they cant really be used. 

Anyway, I asked her again today to close them and she called me an asshole and said she will remove all her makeup because I'm not being fair and apparently she hasn't used those items. 

Now, just to make sure incase anyone's confused, I rarely use my makeup, usually only for events or just for a little fun. I make a concious effort to leave everything clean and closed. 

(I also think I'm probably not the asshole but I live at her house, paying a lot less rent than most people do in my area. I don't want to take advantage of that and also don't want to be kicked out over makeup)

bvu2p8	2019-06-02 05:10:49	withoutguidance	WIBTA if I (f23) told my boyfriend (m29) that I’d only move in with him if we had separate bedrooms?	"I’m sure the obvious answer at a glance is that I’m TA, but I’m still gonna go into detail. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months and his lease is ending in less than a month. He was living with his ex (they were together when they originally moved in over a year ago) so renewing their lease together was out of the question. He says he can’t really afford anything in our city without a roommate and I’m currently living with my mom since I just finished college. So it would be the obvious choice us to move in together.

With our age difference, it’s important to note that I’ve never lived with an SO, while he has moved in with girlfriends in the past, sometimes out of necessity, despite only being with them for a short while. I’m a lot more hesitant in this regard, and it seems like it’s a much bigger step for me than it would be for him. One that I don’t want to rush into and possibly strain the relationship. But he’s been saying it’s either that or he’ll have to move because he can’t afford to live in our city alone.

I was considering telling him the decision for me to move in with him might be made easier if I knew I would still have my own space (ie, my own bedroom). This isn’t to say I wouldn’t still be spending most nights with him in his, but just so that I can still be alone when I feel like I need to recharge my social battery and check in with myself, since I have a history of social anxiety and depression. He also has a 5 year old daughter that he would have on the weekends, and if I had my own bedroom, it would make it easier for them to share his, when she was there (according to him, she’ll cry if he isn’t there sleeping with her.)

A couple of days ago, I went with my mom to drop off my brother at an agreed upon location to his father. It was a 16+ hour drive and we got back to the house around 12 AM. I sent a text to my brother to let him know we made it home, and that we had a safe drive, and that I hope he has an awesome summer with his dad doing a bunch of fun stuff.

Well today my mom confided in me that the morning after (or I guess the morning of) we dropped him off, his father sent my mother a slew of messages about how I sent “multiple” texts to my “half-brother” in the middle of the night, and how I woke everyone up because his phone kept going off, and how if I felt the need to speak to my own brother, I can ask him (his father) permission to speak with him, only through his phone, and that while he is with them I can no longer speak to him because of it.

I understand that I texted without thinking at 12 AM, but I know that I’ve walked past his bedroom many times during the school year after 12 and have had to get on to him to go to sleep, and maybe I should’ve waited until the morning.

bvtzq6	2019-06-02 05:00:18		AITA for not accepting my foster mom's $2?	"Hello AITA. I am on mobile so hopefully my post is cohesive. 

Today I had a 3 hour bus drive from visiting my friends in my hometown. 
My foster mother who i have been with for 4 years now, insists on picking me up from the bus stop because it is dark, which is something I always say thank you for. Many times she is irritable when she picks me up and it leads to nasty arguments. 

So I got off the bus and pass by a chicken shop, which sells really good smelling food.  I walk to my FM's car and immediately when I open the door, I smile,say ""the food from ____ smells really good tonight."" I was in a good mood. She was really quiet and sighed heavily, she does it when she is annoyed or angry. She asked when I last ate. I say a few hours ago, I jokingly say ""if you're offering dinner I will happily accept"". She usually laughs at things like that because she finds it funny how much I eat when given the chance, but seems kinda offended."" So you're not going to pay for your own food?"" She says. My smile fades and I say she has done enough for me today (she gave me money this morning for bus fare because my social worker hasnt dropped off my bus pass) and I am not hungry anyway, I just thought the smell from the restaurant was good.

She sighs again super loud and pulls out a $20. She tries handing it to me and I decline politely. I kinda have to walk on eggshells when shes in a bad mood so I am sure she is annoyed that she thinks I'm trying to subconsciously ask for food or something by joking. She waves it in my face and says I better take it or she's going to get really pissed off if I don't buy food. I am so confused and again, decline, really REALLY hoping not to piss her off. I ask if she is the one who wants food and she says no, get food for yourself NOW, screaming enough for passerbys to look at us. We are still in the parking lot.

I get fed up and say that she should not be getting mad at me for not wanting to spend her money, and that I already said I'm not hungry. She yells at me to apologize or else we are not going anywhere. She says if I just apologized she would see me as more mature. I emphasize that I have not done anything wrong. She calms down a little bit when she realizes I am tearing up (I have always been sensitive to confrontation or someone grilling me in person) and i say I am going to walk to the house instead. She locks the door when I'm about to reach for it and hurriedly pulls out saying ""dont you even think about it,"" and we drive off. She has been ignoring me.

Im 16 and my friend Julian is 17. We have been friends for about 2 years now, and most of our friend group likes him. But whenever we have parties or kickbacks or anything, he always makes excuses to cancel, and when he does show up, he comes 2-3 hours late, and leaves within 2 hours, not drinking/smoking weed and constantly judging us for doing those things. 

3 weeks ago we were planning on having a river party, we cancelled that week cause he had strep throat, next weekend, we cancelled becuase he had to ""house sit"" even though he has no pets, lives in a nice neighborhood and his neighbors offered to do it for him, this weekend, he cancelled becuase he was tired from work, even though he only worked friday night 5-12. 

The rest of the group agreed, that even if he cant come, we are still going to have a party next weekend, and i texted him asking if he was going to come. He said ""idk"" and i told him ""i dont really care if you come, we are doing it regardless. I want you there, but we arent reschudualling for you becuase you have been so unreliable in the past, and dont bother coming if your just going to sit by the fire for 2 hours bitching about how we are drinking and acting like idiots"" 

He left me on read for about an hour, then texted me back ""yeah, probably not coming now, thanks asshole""

This has divided my friend group, 9 of the people invited think im right, and think hes being sensitive, 10 others who where invited think im an asshole and think i should be uninvited for being a dick. I talked to the host, and he agrees with me and says im invited and if anyone else has a problem with that they can feel free to not come.

"So, we got new WiFi 5 months ago , my cousin set it up and put the app to control it on my phone , after I changed the name and it worked. I never opened the app since , the WiFi never slowed down nor needed a reboot so it was fine. But apparently it kicked a few family members off. I don’t know the reason I’m not WiFi genius, it was fine for me. So they call me down today when they are talking with a friend and say to me all sassy and just a “they know I did it” tone even though I didn’t know what was going on , “did you change the WiFi “ and me , knowing I didn’t answered no. So I go and shower and in the middle of the shower I hear a knock on the door but I can’t hear anything , I know it was my dad but I said “WHAT” loudly and turned the water off but he walked away. No big deal I thought whatever he will tell me later. I continue on with my shower and I hear multiple LOUD bangs on the door and my mother screaming “GET OUT HERE NOW, NOW.” Me, having no idea what is going on quickly shuts the water off and starts drying off and quickly getting changed. As this goes on my mother keeps SCREAMING and BANGING the door saying “i don’t care put a towel around you get out here now,” “bring your phone,” “you didn’t do anything wrong just hurry up.” Now I know my mom , she’s screaming all of this I must have done something wrong, but I don’t know what I spent the last hour and half in my room and the prior hours to dinner playing RCT and filming a music video for school. She keeps banging and cursing to hurry up even though I’m still trying to dry off and says “DOWNSTAIRS NOW, GIMME UR PHONE.” She takes it hands it to my sisters husband and tells him to fix the WiFi. I ask what’s going on bc they need me to unlock my phone meanwhile my dad screams “UNLOCK YOUR FUCKING PHONE ,” blatantly in front of our guest , and my mom yelling “unlock now or your phone is gone.” All because I didn’t hear them in the shower , and because they thought I changed the freaking WiFi. After they yelling stops , I asked them what is all this for , for something as minimal as WiFi. They claim “we asked you to come downstairs multiple times but you ignored us and tried to avoid it “ Bruh, I was in the SHOWER I COULDNT HEAR , there’s TWO doors in between. Claiming “you changed it on us , you no longer in control “ by putting someone no one could care less about in control of it when he doesn’t even live here. And worst of it , I knew how to fix it , it’s what I looked up before I showered , but clearly it was UTTERLY URGENT.  Worth getting screamed at for

bvtxdb	2019-06-02 04:51:36	ihavesexregularly	AITA for not tipping the waiter when I dine by myself?	"
^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

Theres a small restaurant I frequent with AMAZING food. It's not that popular and I usually bring first dates/friends and families who are in town here. I've only ate there a few times on my own, and since the staff isnt that large I've gotten the same waiter (lets call him Jon) on many occasions.


I went there today after spending all day working on a project, thought I'd treat myself for a dinner for one with all the progress I've made. Jon was my waiter again, he's an alright kid, just a teenager who works here full time because he knows the owner, nothing special. After my meal Jon stopped me on my way out with a little remark mentioning how I never leave tips when I eat alone. I just laugh and  jokingly say I'll add it to the next tip. He didnt seem too happy, understandable, but I always tip a lot especially when I'm on dates and this kid has probably made a small profit from tips by now so I thought he'd be happy with the answer and say something like ""Cant wait!"" but instead he said ""fuck you man you only tip to make yourself look good"" out loud and walked into the kitchen. I was pretty shocked. 


I wanted to leave on a good note so I stayed around for a while to clear things up since the other waitress noticed the incident. The owner apologized and told me that Jon was upset because I (and probably many others) tip the waitresses a lot more then I tip him. Which is true, the other waitresses are beautiful girls that do a great job while Jon is a teenage boy with no experience, I'm not going to tip him when I'm eating by myself when he does nothing to make the experience any better. 

Cant believe a kid has gotten so into my head that I had to type all this out lol but hes made me question it a little, I realise it sounds like an asshole thing to do, tipping and giving homeless peeps money only when theres people around to ""make yourself look good"". But in the end I still give and tip a lot more then the average person. Jon had probably made more money from me then he makes in a week and he serriously has the audacity to come up to me and curse at me? He just lost out on one of his main sources of income.

TL:DR: some teenager says ""fuck you"" to me for not tipping him.

bvtwgk	2019-06-02 04:48:09	LilBitchCake78	AITA for not wanting to speak to my dad??	"So backstory
I've been wanting some birth control to help regulate my flow and also to make sure that i don't get pregnant. (This happened in December 2018) 

Story:
After talking to the doctor about getting the nexplanon[It goes into your arm. Works great if you're looking for birth control].
 
 The doctor asked me If i was sexually active. Now my dad knew that I did have sex[With my first boyfriend] but he didnt know that I had sex with four other guys throughout the course of the year while I was living in Las Begas. 
So I asked him to leave the room because I wasn't prepared to tell him yet, after the appointment and all that. He kept bothering me in the car asking why couldn't I tell him and poking fun at me. When I finally got annoyed with it and told him how many guys I've been with, he got mad fast. Saying that it was kind of hoeish, that I hurt him badly for having sex, he threatened to take away all the medical care that he set up for me[I cant rely on my mom for shit.] If I keep having sex. 

Every time I spent time with him[I tried hard to avoid him]. He made a comment about it and indirected called me a whore. After he called me that, i started crying and he didn't let me go home until after I spoke with my grandma(His mom, Grandma A) and she lectured me along with my grandpa(Grandpa M). 

 His best friend 'Jessica'(Name is changed) was brought into it and kept harassing me, saying all these things and said that i was lying. I never liked her because 1) she was a complete bitch from the start and 2) wanted me to change my whole self to 'fit' in at school. At some point she said that I'm nothing but a warm body and that I will get herpes. I talked to my dad about this[After grandma A lectured me for not talking to him after possibly getting a concussion] and he did nothing besides basically a slap on the wrist. 
  
 After everything that happened when he asked me why I never like to speak to him, I brought up the fact that he called me a whore and he said that he never did. We ended up arguing, and now I dislike being around my dad even more. But Am I an asshole for not wanting to speak to my dad unless its for stuff I need.

Also context even if I get called an asshole. He doesn't pay child support, he should be but he doesn't. 

Edit: I am now currently 16 and when he found out about the 4 other guys, i was 15

TL;DR
My dad called me a whore and wonders why I don't call him unless its for stuff I need and I am confused if I'm an asshole for not"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvtvza	2019-06-02 04:46:17	Adjnor	AITA for telling my Mum about everything my sister has been doing lately?	"So my little sister (13) is one of my (19) best friend’s. I see her constantly, I have partial custody of her and I’ve met all her friends, who think I’m the “cool sister” and love coming to my place. Because we’re so close, I kinda don’t tell her mother everything. Slight backstory, I’m adopted into this family after a very abusive childhood and I’m very against confrontation, so I don’t tell anything that isn’t physically or mentally harmful to her mother. 

One of her friend’s I like more than the others and she’s kinda like my little sister too, so when I found out they were fighting, I texted friend and asked her her side. Her side (with evidence and other people to support) involved my sister telling classmates I’m a drug dealer and will hook them up (I am not), constantly meeting up and spending very very close up time with this one boy who is known for drinking, vaping, and being caught with weed. He’s also severely racist, sexist, emotionally abusive and mildly physically abusive to tons of girls. Not a huge deal (except the last part) if she was my age, but at 13 that’s a lot. I confronted her about it, she started texting and calling friend to scream at her and started being an ass to me. I said screw it and finally just picked her up from the park she was pouting at, dropped her off at her mothers, and took her phone, tablet, and two back up phones her mum didn’t know about. I also told her mother everything she’d been up to, which resulted in a lot of screaming, yelling, and grounding on everyone’s part and I just stormed out. 


I know this stuff needed out, but AITA? I feel like it looks like I did it because I’m angry at her and I just feel like I did the wrong thing because now she won’t talk to me and her mother is angry that I didn’t tell her every little detail about sisters life and I’m stressed."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I personally don’t enjoy beans in my chili but I also LOVE chili and thought talking about the origins would be cool since it is a food discussion group after all. 
When I brought up the fact that chili was originally made without beans, someone told me to stop gatekeeping what people eat (I wasn’t. Feel free to eat ur chili with beans. I just like history and food). 
Someone else then called me elitist and blocked me because I posted a comment (which I’ll admit was drenched in sarcasm and faux hatred of beans) about the origins of chili con carne.

bvtv3j	2019-06-02 04:43:20		AITA for not wanting to block my cousin?	"I want to apologize in advance for any rules I may break - this is my first time posting and though I did read the rules before this, I still might accidentally mess up. I'll fix things if I have to. Also, formatting might be weird bc I'm on mobile.

My boyfriend, ""Jay,"" has always been the jealous type. He's gotten better about it compared to the beginning of our relationship, but lately he's been convinced that my cousin is after me romantically. His reasoning is that my cousin likes almost everything I post/share on Facebook. Just ""liking,"" not even heart reacts or anything else. We hardly ever talk on there. My cousin does like a lot of my stuff, but I chock it up to him just being online and ofc my stuff has to show up on his feed.

Jay keeps saying that my cousin has a ""cousin crush"" on me. At first I just laughed it off, but he keeps getting more and more serious about it. Tonight, he angrily asked me, ""What is it going to take for you to realize that someone wants to fuck you?"" which kinda made me feel bad considering I'm oblivious and can never really tell if someone is flirting with me or not.

Tonight he also asked me to edit my Facebook privacy so that my cousin couldn't see and therefore ""like"" any of my posts. He said I didn't have to block him completely, just the posts. Jay has asked me to do this before, but I've refused because I feel like I shouldn't have to block my cousin. I know for a fact that my cousin is not after me, but Jay seems to be acting like I'm some naive child who can't see the obvious signs of a ""cousin crush."" I refused again and Jay basically said that he'd get madder and madder about it until he just exploded. I don't like seeing him upset, but like I said before I don't think I should have to block my posts from my cousin. However, it's making me feel kinda bad and somewhat selfish and guilty since I'm being so defiant about it and it's making him upset. AITAH?"		1	0
bvtus7	2019-06-02 04:42:13	blackrose14	AITA for charging my dad full price for a motorcycle?	"Husband and I are wanting to sell our motorcycle cruiser to have some extra cash for our five year anniversary trip in August. It is currently being stored at my parents house two hours away. At first it just sat in their garage gathering dust because my parents aren’t really motorcycle riders and my dad was too busy. But in the last couple of months he’s been riding it and caring for it and showing it off to people. He has been having the time of his life riding it and my mom says it makes him really happy. 

He expressed interest in buying it today and asked if we would take payments for a couple of months. He was still kind of on the fence about buying it even with payments. I told him since we were selling it for trip money in August we’d love to take payments, but we’d like a good chunk up front for our plane ticket money. 

After a couple hours of him deliberating, he said thank you very much but I don’t think I can swing that. I feel like a horrible person because my dad has a lot of health problems due to no fault of his own, and this bike has given him a lot of happiness. Plus he has taken care of it for us for a year. However, my husband and I have never traveled anywhere together and this trip was my first chance to see the ocean and actually fly on a plane for the first time. I guess it’s are we the assholes, but should we let my dad make payments for a few months and try to come up with the money another way?"	Asshole	0	0
bvtufi	2019-06-02 04:41:03		AITA for trying to convince my friend to let a stranger into her car?	"I had this moral dilemma happen years ago, but I thought it would be interesting to post now and see the reaction. But here’s the story: 

Close friend and I are volunteering at a hospital together. After 10, they close the front doors, so you have to leave through the exit. We were walking to the front doors to sign out and we noticed a nice, old lady with big bag of stuff. She was suppose to get onto the bus at ten, but she was lost and the front doors were closed. It’s a far walk to the exit, so we held her bag and walked her there. She was a volunteer too, but it was her first day. She was very weak, and could barely hold her bag.  She had multiple strokes, but wanted to volunteer bc she said it was a good way to give back.
When we get to the bus station, a worker lets us know that the last bus of the day has already headed out. She doesn’t have a phone, and my friend and I left our phones in the car, so we borrow the workers phone and she calls a family member, but they never answer. 

She’s basically without a ride home. Keep in mind this was a few years ago back when there was no Uber or Lyft. Small town with no taxis either. She’s worried at this point, but she goes “don’t worry, I’ll just walk home,” to which I replied, “Of course you won’t walk home! I’ll take you.” My friend hit my arm and I realized after that she was the one who had driven us here, and I didn’t have my car. 

She pulled me aside and went, “We don’t know this lady. We can’t give her a ride.” To which I said, “She’s an old lady. What is she going to do to us?” My friend is like, “No. She could steal my laptop. I have that in my car and our phones.” I told her that I’d grab her phone and hold her laptop in my lap, and she was still like, no I don’t want her in my car. At this point, the old lady could tell my friend wasn’t cool with it and went “don’t worry girls, go home, don’t worry about me,” and she grabbed her big bag and started walking away. I was like, “Hey, hold on!” but I ran up to the worker and asked if there was anyone who could give her a ride and he said no. 

At this point, the old lady had rounded a corner & I took off after her. I thought I could at least walk her to a Whataburger that was near by and use their phone to call my boyfriend to pick us up, but I never found her and I looked for a long time.

My friend found me and said, “It’s not safe for you to be running around here.” It was true. The area surrounding the hospital had a lot of crime and robberies. I laughed, mostly because I was annoyed and went, “Oh, but a ninety year old lady can walk around here past dark, but and not me? Do you see how messed up that it?” We both eventually went home, and argued on who was right, if we should have given her a ride. What do you all think?"	Asshole	1	0

bvtscm	2019-06-02 04:33:43	frose50	AITA for being honest with my family about their religion?	"This has been a longstanding argument within my family for a while now, but it just recently has come to a head. My family is extremely conservative and Catholic. I (25m) started the process of coming out gay (and Atheist) to my family a few years ago and just recently finished the job a few months ago by finally telling my dad. My mom and sister reacted as well as they could - shocked, lots of crying, eventually they have admitted that they accept me (yay?) - but my dad is a different story. He tells me that he still loves me and everything (which is a lot more than many people, I know, and I'm thankful for that), but he will not let it go that I am an Atheist (and subsequently, for some reason, gay). Obviously the teachings of the Catholic church (that homosexual activity is a sin) doesn't vibe well with me, and the fact that my family even after finding out they have a gay family member still proudly proclaim their Catholicism is hurtful to me.

&#x200B;

AITA for telling them that their continued participation in the Catholic church hurts my feelings? Let me be clear - I *never* demanded or implied that I want them to desert their beliefs and overhaul their religious identities (even though I wish they would). My dad and sister were very offended and nearly kicked me out of a family dinner when I told them this - they took it as an attack on their lifestyles (how dare I be hurt by their actions!) even though I was just trying to be honest. My sister, crying, tries to tell me that she doesn't hate gay people, but the thing is that she goes to a church and donates money to an institution that teaches kids that being gay isn't okay, and that bugs me. 

&#x200B;

My father, sister, and mother all constantly get on my back saying how it's hurtful that I don't attend church with them especially on holidays, but it is truly upsetting that they don't understand how hurtful it is to be asked to attend church. Does this make sense? AITA?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

We planned to go shopping and then go to dinner afterwards. My boyfriend has known my two room mates for a while, one might even call them friends. I thought that since they knew each other I would invite my boyfriend to dinner with us.

After shopping I decided that I didn't really want to go to dinner afterwards. I felt tired and wasn't feeling the best and I told him that I didn't exactly feel like going to dinner after a whole day of shopping. He agreed and said that I should probably stay home since I was so tired, even though I had already told my roommates that I would go out with them. 

Shortly after, I asked him if he would like to stay home with me and cook dinner instead, or do homework with me or just hang out together. He refused and said that he had waited too long for us to pick him up to go to dinner, and that he really wanted to go to the restaurant that we had agreed on. He refused to stay home with me and went to dinner with my roommates instead.

I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s best summarized as her being *too* nice most of the time. From time to time, she will say something really bitchy and cynical, and she gets a free pass because she’s so nice most of the time, but when she does say something mean, she doesn’t hold back. 

At some point, we had a disagreement about something really stupid. I was very annoyed with the tone she was using (best summarized as being very condescending). I explained to her she wasn’t always right and she didn’t have to talk to me like a child. Now, my interactions with her are very limited and she blatantly ignores anything I say that’s addressed to the group (we are in the same friends group). It’s very uncomfortable.

I acknowledge that not everyone gets along, but since everyone else loves her, I have to ask myself if I’m in the wrong here?

bvtp7b	2019-06-02 04:22:39	tn_notahick	"AITA for not standing up during ""God Bless America""?"	"Background: I live in the middle of the bible belt.  The area is also patriotic to the point of nearly being nationalistic. 

Our local minor league baseball team often brings in singers to sing God Bless America in the middle of the 7th inning. 

They announce the performers and ask everyone to stand, and gentlemen remove their caps. 

I feel that the National Anthem is worthy of standing and removing hats, but GBA is literally just another song. I believe that giving the song the same respect of the National Anthem dilutes the respect that the NA deserves.  And, frankly, as an athiest, I have a big problem standing for a song that claims a higher power should favor our country over all others.

I noticed a skateboard with nobody around. I haven't skateboarded in years and it looked kind of abandoned. It isn't in the greatest condition, the nose and tail are kind of worn down and cracked and the grip tape is peeling. I said I would go back in a few hours and if it was still there I'd take it. I went back at midnight and it was in the same spot. At this time nobody was at the location at all. I scooped it up.

I can't tell if what I did was a case of finders keepers, or if I literally stole some unknown person's property. In my head the person would have noticed it was missing before they left, and they would have came back for it in that time.

bvtlb9	2019-06-02 04:09:32		AITA for for arguing with my wife over purchases	"Essentially my wife buys things for our house, like decorative items.  She bought two $1000 book shelves for our living room, which I agreed too.  She bought about $400 worth of paint and I went along with that as well.  She wanted a $2700 couch and I said sure.  Almost everyday there is amazon boxes showing up at our house with smaller decorative items.  She always justifies the purchases with “there for the house,” and that in her eyes means they are for both of us.  So, basically I wanted a $2300 dollar topper for my truck.  As always when I want to purchase a large ticket item a fight ensues. It starts by her bringing up every large purchase that I have made over the last ten years.  Just so you know these purchases are as follows: in 2012 I bought a MacBook.  We bought her an iMac on that same purchase.  My mountain bike, which she also got a mountain bike on the same trip.  A few pairs of sunglasses, and an IPad.  All of which involved an argument just like this one, before I was allowed to make the purchase.  

Am I being selfish?  Are her items really less selfish then mine because they are for the house?  Some of this is just getting old for me, I’m tired of arguing when I want to buy something.  I don’t argue and question everything she buys, but the same respect does not seem to be shared with me. Everything I want to buy is scrutinized and starts an argument.  For back story on this we make with $5000 a year of each other and we do relatively well.

During this and covered in dog, I told the handler I'm allergic to dogs and asked how much longer it would be and he rolled his eyes. 

I nearly instantly broke out in hives. People seated near me at the gate were talking about how I was being dramatic and the handler seemed irritated that I asked the question.  I respect that they have a job to do but WITA for saying something? If I was, what do I do in the future? I have an inhaler and EpiPen for the allergy and try not to be a nuisance.

Context:
I have a friend who I'm really close with. They're probably my best friend. We've talked about getting together for months, just hanging out and then me crashing at they and their mom's place, but lately when I bring it up, it seems like they're avoiding the subject and they change the course of the conversation. 

Usually this wouldn't bug me, as I know they're really busy and usually when we can't hang out it's just a scheduling conflict. Lately, however, they've been making lots of last minute plans with other people and if those plans fall through, almost immediately rescheduling for a later date. Sufficed to say I'm getting a little frustrated. We've scheduled it before, other stuff came up for them and we weren't able to get together, but no effort was made on their part to try and reschedule and when I try to bring it up, they dodge the conversation. I don't want to push them, but I like planning things out ahead of time, especially when I'll be crashing for the night.

I feel like they're avoiding me, which I get. When you spend a lot of time talking to someone sometimes you just might want some space and I understand that. But we made an agreement before that we'd always be honest about stuff like that. They've needed space before and I've happily given it to them. It feels different this time. I dunno. Maybe I'm just thinking about it too much. 

Would I be an asshole if I talked to them about how I've felt surrounding this stuff? Or am I over thinking this?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
